Trade Unionism and the Control of Industry 



rABOR should not be regarded merely as a com- 
modity or article of commerce." 

This sentence is the work of a World Legislature, 
sitting at Paris; the italics are supplied by officials 
of the American Federation of Labor, whose atten- 
tion is for the time being fixed upon a word. It 
appears that the American labor delegation took 
with them to Paris the positive assertion of the Clay- 
ton Act that " the labor of a human being is not a 
commodity or article of commerce;" and in Paris 
the positive was exchanged for an equally emphatic 
negative. Thus the Fifteenth Point! 

In discussing this formula it will be convenient 
to lay ideals aside for the moment and to examine 
conditions as they exist here in America. This per- 
mits the discovery that M. Clemenceau's version of 
the dogma comes nearer the truth than does Mr. 
Gompers' uncorrupted original. The Clayton Act 
provided a legalistic safeguard against the legalistic 
menace of the Sherman Act. Under the protection 
of this safeguard labor is still handled as a commod- 
ity, and will continue to be so 'handled as long as 
the American Federation of Labor cherishes its tra- 
ditional national-craft-union policy. 

In- the course of political history, the rights of 
habeas corpus and trial by jury were secured before 
the citizenry began to exercise the responsibilities of 
voting and holding office. Just so, when industrial 
democracy has been achieved and the time has come 
for writing the history of that achievement, it will 
be seen that craft unionism belongs to that period of 
economic evolution when the workers are concerned 
with the acquisition of rights rather than with the 
assumption of responsibilities. It is considered to 
be the right of the laborer to sell his services under 
favorable conditions, variously defined. Craft union- 
ism organizes the workers in such a manner that 
they exercise collectively this right to dispose of 
what is to all intents and purposes a commodity 
labor power of a given quantity and quality, stamped 
with the union label. Now the laborer has likewise 
a responsibility to produce goods but of this re- 
sponsibility the old-style union has little to say. 
Under union control labor power functions as im- 
personally as electric power. Just as long as this 
is true as long as the last output of the laborer is 



labor just so long will labor be a commodity. 
A careful examination of the industrial scene will 
show that even as a merchandiser of 'human effort 
the American Federation of Labor has found its 
traditional policy of trade-union autonomy put to a 
considerable strain by war and post-war conditions. 
The handling of shipyard labor will furnish a case 
in point. Wartime pressure for production brought 
a flood of unorganized labor into the shipbuilding 
industry ; some of the craft unions having control of 
skilled labor in the yards were apparently indifferent 
to the fate of the newcomers; the. Longshoremen 
finally invaded the field and organized numerous 
locals of riggers, helpers, " wood-fasteners," and 
other miscellany. Time out of mind the work of 
" fastening " had been done by ship's carpenters, 
unionized and well paid. Early in the war a special 
class of men was developed to perform this com- 
paratively routine task of bolting to the ribs of 
the ship the boards cut by the carpenters. These 
specialists worked for wages considerably lower than 
those of the carpenters, and were not unionized until 
they were taken into the conglomerate groups chart- 
ered by the Longshoremen. With the end of hostili- 
ties and the slacking off of the shipbuilding program, 
it became apparent that fasteners and other men 
in the Longshoremen's unions were doing work that 
in quiet times might serve to keep better men busy. 
A high degree of solicitude for the fate of the newly- 
organized workers became manifest; at the recent 
A. F. of L. convention the fasteners were handed 
over to the Carpenters, the riggers to the Iron 
Workers, the helpers and apprentices to the interna- 
tionals of their respective trades, and the remaining 
miscellany to the International Hodcarriers', Build- 
ing and Common Laborers' Union of North Amer- 
ica. Such a bandying about of the newly organized 
workers is typical of makeshift efforts to gain 
strength for lean months and years in industries 
where the pressure of a labor reserve developed in 
wartime will put a heavy strain upon the standards 
of the old craft unions. Some system that will 
secure the complete local cooperation of skilled and 
thoroughly organized workers, unskilled workers 
newly organized, and women workers new both to 
industry and to organization is absolutely essential

in this day of shifting conditions and new bargains. 

It is remarkable that in the iron and steel indus- 
try, where the issue is not the preservation of estab- 
lished standards but the expansion of organization, 
the " international " craft unions have pooled their 
interests to a degree hitherto unheard of in the 
history of American trade-unionism. The iron and 
steel campaign has been compared to a Billy Sunday 
revival; each of the twenty-four internationals con- 
cerned contributes men and money to carry on the 
work with the understanding that the recruits will 
later be apportioned to their proper craft organiza- 
tions. As far as this recruiting campaign is con- 
cerned, the National Committee for the Organiza- 
tion of Iron and Steel Workers constitutes an 
industrial union. But the petition of some of the 
newly organized men for the creation of an Iron 
and Steel Department to give permanence to this 
industrial unity was denied by the American Fed- 
eration of Labor convention, presumably on the 
ground that the groups which are raised up to- 
gether will hereafter be able, by dint of tremendous 
effort, to stand separately. The question of the 
disposition to be made of the common laborers in 
this field aroused a slight flurry of debate at the 
convention, but was disposed of for the time being. 
A move to authorize the transfer without charge 
from one craft group to another of men wrongly 
assigned by organizers was defeated on the ground 
that the international unions alone had jurisdiction 
over such matters. It may be noted that the new 
locals, already embracing 100,000 of the 500,000 
men in the industry, have shown a disposition to 
raise the initiation fee as soon as the National Com- 
mittee releases control of them. All things con- 
sidered, it is apparent that in this industry the A. 
F. of L. is threatened with a victoire disintegrate. 

More interesting than the National Committee's 
temporary alliance is the proposal for the permanent 
amalgamation of the fourteen internationals now 
loosely federated in the Metal Trades Department 
of the A. F. of L. By a seven to one vote of the 
rank and file, the Machinists' Association has gone 
on record as favoring this proposal to create what 
practically amounts to a great industrial union, but 
the measure did not meet with favor in this year's 
convention of the Metal Trades Department. 

Another proposal that has caused considerable 
uneasiness in high official circles is the " Seattle 
plan " for consolidating the executive organizations 
of- the no or more internationals affiliated with the 
A. F. of L. into approximately twelve staff groups, 
each of which groups would control a given indus- 
trial field within which the craft locals would 
function much as they do at present. The chief 
argument for amalgamation at the top is that at 



present the various craft locals whose members 
are employed in a given industrial plant, or group of 
plants, cannot combine to enforce a common policy 
until each of these locals has secured the authoriza- 
tion of its international executive. The failure of 
one international headquarters to approve the locally 
formulated plan makes united action impossible. It 
is reported from Seattle that of the one hundred 
city central labor bodies that have already acted on 
the proposal for wholesale amalgamation, only two 
have failed to approve it. 

This plan was not submitted to the convention 
at Atlantic City, as it was a foregone conclusion that 
it would meet with defeat. But an effort was made 
to get the convention to indorse a measure looking 
toward the establishment of initiative and referen- 
dum in the internationals, the idea being that the 
installation of such machinery would enable the 
rank and file to make known their wishes as to 
amalgamation and other progressive measures. The 
initiative-and-referendum proposal was overwhelm- 
ingly defeated, as were measures providing for the 
direct election of officers of the A. F. of L. and for 
their recall. Finally the conservatives proposed to 
amend the constitution of the Federation to provide 
that any central labor body circulating propaganda 
with the object of changing the constitution of the 
internationals or of the A. F. of L., without first 
getting the approval of the Executive Council of the 
Federation, could be punished by the revocation of 
its charter. After a hot debate; this proposed amend- 
ment was withdrawn, but it has been stated by a 
member of the Executive Council that this council 
has the power to revoke charters under the condi- 
tions described whether it be specifically so stated 
in the constitution or not. The constitution has al- 
ways forbidden central bodies to call strikes; an 
accepted amendment now prohibits their taking a 
strike vote. The attitude of the A. F. of L. con- 
vention toward every innovation that threatens to 
diminish official prerogative or the autonomy of 
the internationals is easily understood when it is 
remembered that the voting strength of the body is 
almost wholly in the hands of the delegates of the 
internationals, nearly all of whom are at the same 
time salaried officers of these internationals. In the 
past the Federation has consistently supported meas 
ures looking toward the extension of popular gov- 
ernment in the political field ; if sincere conservatism 
is in a measure responsible for distrust of the ability 
of its own members to exercise an industrial fran- 
chise, yet personal interest must account in part for 
the Federation's cavalier handling of the preroga- 
tives of others for instance, those of the judiciary 
as contrasted with its tender solicitude for pre- 
rogatives traditionally its own. 



1919 



THE DIAL 



Such being the dominant official attitude toward 
reforms intended to improve the efficiency of the 
unions as merchandisers of human effort, it is not 
surprising that revolutionary measures aiming to 
secure for labor the control of industry have met 
with small encouragement in official circles. It 
is said that a member of the Executive Council of 
the Federation made a union-label speech in Russia 
after the Revolution! In the Western United 
States, and to a greater degree in Canada, the city 
central bodies have found themselves ground be- 
tween new ambitions below and old prerogatives 
above. This pervading restlessness resulted at the 
Atlantic City convention in repeated meetings of 
central body delegates, at which expressions of 
mutual dissatisfaction were exchanged and arrange- 
ments were made for direct correspondence between 
the centrals and for caucuses of central body dele- 
gates at ensuing conventions. In the Northwest the 
matter has gone much farther; for a time Seattle 
defied the authority of the internationals, and in 
parts of Western Canada the old superstructure has 
been entirely blown to pieces. 

According to one of the speakers who addressed 
the convention, failure to meet this new situation 
means the death of the internationals. The speaker 
illustrated: It appears that the pressmen and typo- 
graphers of Winnipeg either refused to ballot on the 
question of a general strike, or voted against this 
action. Nevertheless the Winnipeg central body, 
supported by a majority of the unions of the city, 
called the strike in defiance of the authority of the 
internationals and effected such a complete tie-up 
that the pressmen and typographers were obliged, 
against their will, to quit work. Apparently it did 
not occur to the speaker that the theory of collective 
bargaining withdraws the right to work from the 
individual and places it under the control of the 
group; the group which has hitherto exercised the 
right has been the local craft union, with the consent 
of the international craft organization; in Western 
Canada the city central claims this right and has 
exercised it with full effect. Many of the centrals 
in this region have taken the final step by seceding 
from the Federation and joining the One Big Union 
movement, which has for its object " the abolition 
of the present system of production for profit, and 
the substitution therefor of production for use." 

Now it happens that in a certain number of 
American industries, for the period of the war, 
production was actually carried on for production's 
sake although it is nowhere recorded that profit 
was entirely denied! The War Labor Board and 
the Macy Board, organized to secure the coopera- 
tion of labor in this limited field and for this pe- 
riod, were not long in discovering that trade unions 



organized to sell labor were of little significance 
when labor was being bought at its own price; 
what was needed was not an organization that de- 
livered labor to the factory but one that would deal 
with the productive functioning of labor, on the 
job. In a very short space of time there developed 
in this country a number of embryonic industrial 
states, each having for its citizens the workers in 
a single plant a production unit united to select 
from among their own number a committee that 
exercised over them some degree of authority. 

This form of organization is not new in America. 
The printers' chapel is a shop republic in rudimen- 
tary form. In the woman's garment industry the 
system has come to a rather full development, per- 
haps for the reason that the International Ladies' 
Garment Workers' Union is to all intents and pur- 
poses an industrial union, so organized as to throw 
all operatives except the cutters into general locals 
without regard to craft lines. Shop organization 
has also been very completely developed in certain 
non-union plants as a substitute for craft union- 
ism. Proponents of the traditional: trade-union 
policy are extremely distrustful of shop organization 
of its weakness and its strength ; locally developed 
and unfortified by the wide connections supplied by 
national craft integration, the shop unit may serve 
to hold the workers completely under the control 
of the employer; strengthened by extensive federa- 
tion, the shop system will break down craft divi- 
sions and render powerless the official hierarchy de- 
veloped by the national trade unions. In England 
the national craft system was considerably weakened 
during the war, and the shop units had the oppor- 
tunity to achieve extensive federation. In America 
the internationals have retained their monopoly over 
affairs that reach beyond the shop, leaving the shop 
organization to maintain unassisted the form but not 
the fact of industrial democracy. 

Nevertheless it is true that while American craft 
unionism is selling labor, and Canadian city cen- 
trals are exercising a control of industry that ap- 
proximates a dictatorship, shop units have in /one 
small section of the United States achieved the com- 
bination of control and responsibility that means 
industrial democracy. This result has been obtained 
in the cooperative shingle and lumber mills of Wash- 
ington, operated with the full support of the trade- 
union movement of the Northwest. The organiza- 
tion of these mills was begun in 1912; today more 
than twenty plants are in successful operation. The 
mills are owned by the men, paid for by surplus 
earnings; the managers, the foremen, and the trus- 
tees are elected by the workers from among their 
own number and are subject to recall; the plants are 
completely unionized and the men are able to pay

themselves considerably more than the union scale of 
wages. Thus it appears that shop-unit organization 
is capable of the least and the most that the labor 
movement can achieve; while labor remains a com- 
modity, dissociated shop units may exhibit less 
strength at collective bargaining than the craft in- 
ternationals; but when labor is reorganized for the 
control of production, the shop republic becomes the 
natural self-directing unit of industrial democracy. 
In the hands of capital, shop organization threatens 
labor's bargaining power; in the hands of labor it 
may achieve the control of national economic life. 
The A. F. of L. already has available much of the 
machinery necessary for the geographic and indus- 
trial federation of these elementary units of economic 
society. Once relieved of the heavy restrictions now 
placed upon them, the city trades councils are capa- 
ble of integrating all the interests common to a 
regional group of plants; industrial alliances of 
craft unions like the railway Brotherhoods, and true 
industrial unions like the United Mine Workers, 
provide the machinery for national federation by in- 
dustries. Finally both regional and industrial inter- 
ests meet in the A. F. of L., which already exercises 
legislative, executive, and judicial functions. 

If the traditional program of the Federation does 
not provide for the gradual assumption by local 
units of the responsibilities of production, no more 
does it provide for the acquisition of control at the 
top. A craft union whose members are scattered 
through a hundred industries may under certain 
circumstances be able to sell the labor of its mem- 
bers to advantage, but under no condition is it in 
a position to assume the control of any one of 
these industries. At present the inconsistency of 
the Federation is the measure of its potentialities for 
progress. The convention that refused to pass a 
resolution encouraging workmen to demand the right 
to elect their own foremen also voted approval of 



the plan of the Brotherhoods for the operation of 
the railways under the joint control of the classified 
employees, the appointed officers, and th'e govern- 
ment ! Steps have already been taken looking toward 
the admission to the Federation of the Conductors, 
Engineers, Firemen, and Trainmen, who together 
constitute the strongest industrial group of organized 
workers in America. In another quarter also new 
ambitions are stirring. The United Mine Workers 
claim to control 65 to 70 per cent of the coal mine 
operatives in the United States; the Policy Com- 
mittee of this great industrial union has already 
declared in favor of the nationalization of the coal 
mines. At the September convention of the Mine 
Workers this policy will be framed in detail. Presi- 
dent Moyer of the Mine, Mill, and Smelter Work- 
ers (claiming the adherence of 40 per cent of the 
metal miners of the country) has declared himself 
in full sympathy with the policy of the Brother- 
hoods and of the United; at its next meeting his 
Executive Council will consider the formulation of 
a nationalization policy. 

The business of making predictions is fairly safe 
and not always profitless. It is safe to say that some- 
thing in the nature of a Dual Alliance of Miners 
and Railway Workers has become a possibility in 
America, at the moment when a movement for local 
autonomy and the control of industry by the workers 
is shaking the foundations of the craft system. In 
some cases control will be acquired over a whole in- 
dustry at a single stroke; in other cases there will 
be a gradual annexation of one plant after another. 
But in every instance, if control is to be more than an 
irresponsible dictatorship, the organization exercis- 
ing the directive power must be coterminous with 
the field of operation it controls, capable of assuming 
the duties as well as the rights of industrial democ- 
racy.

My Comrade 



I am laughing with the smell of the river; 

I am laughing with the hidden wind swelling up over the lap and shoulders, and 

winding about the neck of my green world ; 
I am laughing with the sweeps of rank grass and the calm shining miles of floating 

river ; 
I am laughing with the knowledge of heaped pine boughs and wet moldy earth, 

and last uncurling leaves of middle June : 
I am laughing with the heavy wasteful leafage ; 
I am laughing with yellow tons of spacious sunshine pressing lightly, like a

All of me is absorbed and jubilant, in my gleaming comrade, the manifold person

THE DIAL 



A 



The Shop Committee Some Implications 



PPARENTLY QUITE OUT of the cloudiest of 

skies and the most vacant of national minds, comes 
suddenly a burst of discussion on the shop commit- 
tee. The chorus is joined by the reconstruction 
committee of Catholic Bishops, by the inquiring 
United States Chamber of Commerce and the In- 
dustrial Conference Board, by thousands of Metho- 
dist pastors and communicants, by the Federal 
Council of Churches of Christ, by numerous sa- 
vants in the untrodden field of industrial relations, 
and lastly by converted employer after employer.' 
Somehow we do not hear much of enthusiastic ex- 
pression from labor, organized or unorganized. The 
apostles and prophets of industrial democracy hail 
mainly from the side of management or from the 
general public. 

Let us at the start define. By shop committee 
movement we mean the movement toward a shar- 
ing of control of industry to large or small extent 
through the instrumentality of variously constituted 
joint committees of employer and employee in the 
local shop as well as in the industry outside the 
local shop or factory plant. The shop committee 
movement thus includes the whole program ex- 
plained and promoted in the classic British doc- 
uments of the movement, the Whitley and Garton 
Foundation reports. In America the documents 
are few. The best official paper is the Wolfe re- 
port published by the United States Shipping Board, 
frankly a " follow-up " of the British plans. 

Regarded physically, the shop committee in all its 
forms is a system of industrial government. It 
may arise either as a concession wrung from capital 
by a convincing show of labor's power, or as a be- 
stowal of enlightened capital, honestly seeking to 
weather the coming storm. Its implications are 
manifold and include considerations of trade union- 
ism, industrial unionism, intensive labor organiza- 
tion, management pure and simple, and ever and 
always the development of collective bargaining from 
the point of agreeing to bargain about such elemen- 
tary questions as sanitation, to agreeing to discuss 
an entire business, with the secret books of profit 
thrown open and the office force unionized. 

In other words the shop committee movement 
is nothing or everything. 

Narrowing the discussion down to the shop com- 
mittee movement as applied to the individual plant, 
it is a significant fact that up to the time the United 
States Government began to foster shop commit- 
tees as a war measure, most of the important sys- 
tems established prior to 1918 came directly on the 



heels of bitter labor wars. A notable illustration of 
this tendency is the so-called Colorado plan, set up 
by Rockefeller after machine guns had failed to 
maintain the production of coal and iron. Others 
might be instanced. Most of the shop committee 
systems in American factories, again, have been in- 
stalled either as a weapon against the union or as a 
substitute for the union. This also is a significant 
fact, though officially the shop committee movement 
is neutral on the union question. 

In form the shop committee is widely various. 
We may trace the beginnings of certain types of 
shop committee systems. There is, for example, 
the type which gives employees elected representa- 
tives in the proportion of one to every hundred or 
hundred and fifty employees, largely irrespective of 
craft. There is the type which is founded on the 
United States Government, consisting of a house, 
composed of employee representatives, a senate, com- 
posed of foremen, and a cabinet composed of the 
executive staff with the manager as president. 
There is the type which gives more complete rep- 
resentation to craft. There are combinations of 
these types. In each type runs the principle that 
the elected representatives of the employees must 
be elected secretly by the employees of the particular 
plant, in the plant, and solely as of the plant. All 
the types thus briefly described may be benevolently 
handed down, ready-made, by the management, or 
they may be devised in honest, open conference by 
men and management, acting jointly. There are 
also patent shop committee systems, sold by indus- 
trial experts, and guaranteed to do away with agi- 
tators and to lift profits to unheard of percentages. 

The details of the actual machinery of a shop 
committee system in a factory need not concern us 
at this moment. They are indeed vital, but they 
can have no vitality whatever unless before the mo- 
ment of creation there is on both sides the right 
spirit. The employer should have the desire to 
treat with his employees collectively, irrespective of 
union affiliation, and he ought to be awake to the 
fact that the time has come when employers must 
no longer oppose, but must rather assist, the birth of 
the new industrial age. The employee should have 
the sense to see that something is better than noth- 
ing and that however much it may be the object of 
a specific management to bolster up an outworn 
business code or to sign a peace treaty on such terms 
that peace is unstable, almost any shop committee 
organization gives him a position from which he 
may may move the world.

that stands condemned for threatening to stop the 
'industry, but capital for giving labor just cause for 
stopping it. 

The Commission has continued its labors, and 
social philosophers, professors of economics, tech- 
nicians, quasi-millionaires, and peers of the realm 
have been forced to submit to its inquisitorial omnip- 
otence. The last citadel in which the existing 
owners hope to make themselves safe is a gigantic 
trust where capital, management, and labor, sharing 
profits, will form a new triple alliance for skinning 
the consumer alive. Fortunately it is damned at 
birth; the miners are explicit that they will work 
willingly only for the community. Sir Richard 
Redmayne, the Government's mining expert, charac- 
terizing the present system as wasteful and extrava- 
gant, favored a trust on the grounds of enhanced 
production at diminished cost, and the prevention of 
waste ; he frowned on nationalization out of fear and 
distrust of the bureaucracy. He was obviously taken 
aback by the suggestion of nominal national owner- 
ship with decentralized control by administrative, 
technical, and manual labor, working in unison. 
Moreover, he was informed by a miners' representa- 
tive on the Commission that " a partnership between 
capital and labor was neither practical nor desir- 
able." The power for evil of such a trust, with 
labor possessing a vested interest in profiteering, is 
incalculable, and the public has good reason to thank 
the miners for refusing to look at it. Their support 
assumed, however, it must have constituted the next 
phase of British industry. What is the exact posi- 
tion, then, since the existing order, unification on the 
basis of private monopoly, and even nationalization 
with bureaucratic control, are all condemned to- 
gether? That nothing is left but nationalization 
and joint-control on a decentralized basis. 

Nationalization may be taken for granted as 
essential to any improved system of control, and a 
new bone of contention is the basis of compensation 
to the present proprietors. Are they to be bought 
out in the government's phrase " at a price arrived 
at as between a willing buyer and a willing seller," 
and if not, at a price arrived at how? Is the price 
to be what will continue to bring the same returns 
when converted to government stock? If so, the 
last vestige of the owners' responsibility gone, them- 
selves become practically civil pensioners for who 
knows how many generations, they will not have 
made such a bad bargain. On the face of it it seems 
absurd ; neither payee nor seller is willing ; both are 
forced by the Triple Alliance. And when an in- 
dustry changes hands, not merely the plant is trans- 
ferred, but the goodwill of the customers and the 
sources of raw material as well. Heretofore labor 



having no will, had no goodwill to be disposed of; 
but today a willing buyer of the mines would 
"undoubtedly require the goodwill of labor among 
the other effects. By their past misconduct of the 
industry, the mine owners have forfeited labor's 
goodwill, and never can they hope to recover it; nay, 
labor will render its goodwill direct to the nation 
only, without reference to the mine owners. When 
the mines become national property, therefore, the 
goodwill of labor must be excluded from the assess- 
ment. And what more than the bare equivalent of 
the original and added real capital, we ask, can any- 
body say the mines, and if you like, the minerals, arc 
worth minus the goodwill of the Miners' Federa- 
tion? 

Questioned by the Premier before the Commission 
was appointed as to the introduction of a claim for 
joint management, Mr. Smillie, President of the 
Miners' Federation, replied that it was " due to the 
progress of Trade Union thought." What exactly 
is advanced Trade Union thought aiming at? It 
has visions of a society where services rendered will 
be the only title-deed to rights, where the individual 
will be responsible for his function, and have scope 
for the expression of his individuality in performing 
it. The forms through which these principles are 
to work are complete self-directing corporations, 
freely associated for the purpose of assuming collec- 
tive responsibility for running the nation's industries, 
and built on the framework of the existing indus- 
trial and professional organizations. Their stand- 
ards are to be the well-being of the producers and of 
the community. Voluntarily interrelated, absorbing 
all labor, actual and potential, the corporations are 
to include everybody from the general manager to 
the office boys and apprentices whose presence is es- 
sential to the best service. By a decentralized system 
of control, all must have a voice in determining the 
details of the work. Final authority is to remain 
vested in the State, which will fix the general prin- 
ciples within the sphere of which the corporations 
are to possess autonomy. The idea, in short, is the 
application of Guild principles to modern industry. 
The gradual accumulation of trade union tradition 
and the completion of the industrial organizations in 
Britain has made it perhaps the one country of the 
world where such a development can be regarded as 
natural, and likely to prove successful. That trade 
union will, intelligence, and power march in step 
makes it nearly inevitable. 

For the success of such a system, however, we 
need two as yet unfulfilled conditions; namely, the 
harmonious voluntary cooperation of management 
and labor, and the power of the two jointly to organ- 
ize credit. Failing these, how shall processes and 



1919

services be coordinated without external interfer- 
ence, and how shall distribution and exchange, home 
and abroad, flow smoothly? The complexity of 
credit operations, which the war and the creation of 
a mass of paper wealth have made still more delicate, 
backed by the almost unlimited power of the credit 
controllers, renders it impossible for any unaided 
labor corporation to solve the credit problem. It 
may in the attempt provoke civil war, which Eng- 
land no less than Germany must avoid at any cost. 
Impoverished by the destruction of its current pro- 
duce in war, what must England surely suffer if she 
were to run amuck in her own house? In this 
immense factory, revolution could be the deliberate 
object of nobody but lunatics, and a spontaneous 
outbreak arising from the lunacy of despair is un- 
necessary and unlikely. Reaction is the recruiting 
sergeant of the revolutionaries, and even in England 
efforts to stop the clock might bring disaster. The 
credit problem is everybody's problem; it cries at 
everybody's door for solution; the nation groans in 
face of it; moreover it must be solved before the 



functional society planned by the social philosophers 
can have even rudimentary being. We live in faith 
that Britain will solve it constitutionally. 

Management the middle class of present-day 
terminology is still undecided on which side to 
throw its weight; whether in the end it will join 
forces with capital or with labor depends on two 
things, the progress of ideas and the oscillation of the 
balance of power between the two. In its most en- 
lightened quarters, however, management is awake to 
the fact that the future is with labor; the National 
Association of Shipbuilding and Engineering 
Draughtsmen, for instance, includes in its program 
" the control of the industry in conjunction with all 
the workers engaged in it." But the union for better 
or worse of management and labor in the mining 
industry being wanting, joint-management between 
the State and the Miners' Federation appears, since 
all the counter proposals are open to such serious 
objection, to be the essential next step in the march 
of civilization in Britain. 



ALBERT NEWSOME. 



Bags and Barrows 



OUR YEARS AGO I gained the happy friendship 
of Mrs. Mary Ann, and she was a London coster- 
monger, and the best friend I ever had. 

There is no race in the world quite like the race 
of London costermongers, and in their own reasoned 
opinion none to equal it. Outside information 
about costermongers, I find, does not often go much 
beyond the word " buttons." The buttons are the 
disguise of the coster, the shining armor in which 
he encloses himself in self-defense against an im- 
pertinent world of social trespassers and journalists. 
If a coster goes " up west," he dons his buttons, and 
decorates his donkey and his wife absurdly with 
feathers. It is as if he knew that these things arrest 
and dazzle the eye of the silly outsider. The merely 
international audience of the International Horse 
Show the most unique feature of which the coster 
is permitted to provide annually will concentrate 
its field glasses upon the buttons, and say, "Ah . . 
buttons . . costermongers. . . Albert Chev- 
alier . . how quaint, . . ." and enquire no 
further. 

The London coster or barrer-chap, is the knight 
errant of the East End; on him the mantle of the 
soldier of fortune has fallen. In spite of his loud 
voice and his unreticence, there is always a hint of 
mystery and romance, I think, in his coming and 
going. The rattle of his donkey and barrow over 
the cobbles of his narrow courts has a reminder in 
it of distant undomestic days, when those narrow 



courts were loud with the passing of young armed 
men with their pockets full of money and their heads 
full of wine and their hearts full of the vague and 
shining pursuit of adventure. The coster, though 
caged behind the bars of London, manages to live 
violently and generously, and to bring the delusion 
of speed and space and the quick elements into our 
dim close streets. 

While it is still very early and starry, he and his 
donkey swing out into an unknown dawn-lit wilder- 
ness of markets. There I like to imagine all the 
riches of the earth spread out for his choosing. 
There he swaggers, clinking the money in his great 
pockets, up and down, between hills of flowers and N 
green things with morning smells, and golden fruits 
from very distant incredible lands. Thence he comes 
with the rising of the sun, striding with a loud song 
beside his barrow, which is loaded to the very 
donkey's tail with treasure. On his way to his pitch, 
he stops at such shops as Mrs. Mary Ann's, and 
lifts off his head the high basket of flowers, and 
fills his pockets with little parcels of her merchan- 
dise, and tells us the news of early-rising London, 
and whose eye was blacked up his court last night, 
and in whose honor his donkey wears a rose in its 
hair this morning. 

Mrs. Mary Ann is a coster whose body has been 
caught and made prisoner by misadventure, but 
whose spirit still runs wild. Early in life she was 
disabled by the loss of a leg, and from the resulting 



12

conditions I think she gained much of her sympathy 
and her ardent courage. To her little Ground 
Floor Front come all the Brown Borough comedies 
to catch her smile, and all the tragedies to look for 
the comfort that she knows how to give. She has 
a very loud discordant laugh, and a fine swearing 
range, and an unerring aim in the throwing of her 
crutch, .but she has no worldly wisdom. Blankets, 
bought with great difficulty, seem to ebb away from 
her bed to the beds of her least desirable friends. 
Somehow there is always a slip between her cup and 
lip, her supper is apt to take wings unto itself and 
fly upstairs to Bill Watson's latest woman, who, as 
the depressing Brown Borough idiom has it, is " just 
expecting her trouble." 

At the beginning of the war, Mrs. Mary Ann 
and I found a small seriously damaged room over- 
looking the only tree in the Brown Borough. Its 
wainscoting had fallen down, -but we propped it up 
with our two chairs; on its floor we trod gingerly; 
its wall was, in parts, composed of wallpaper only. 
I remember that Mrs. Mary Ann's crutch, thrown 
at an offending customer, once made a hole in the 
wall. We had to paste it over with a half-pint 
banana bag. In this room Mrs. Mary Ann and I 
established our bag-business; from this room into 
thousands of, offices and homes went our little brown 
paper bags filled with the kindly fruits of the earth. 
All day Mrs. Mary Ann sat before the big broken 
window with her eyes on the unique tree and her 
independent hands unceasingly at work amid a 
mountain range of paper. Up the slopes of the 
range swept her dripping brush, and down the 
slopes slid her thumb, folding the edges of a 
thousand sheets with one regal gesture. It was 
Young Ninny, the adopted daughter, who separated 
the finished bags into little tame packets, half-pints, 
ones, and twos, and tied them together in hundreds. 
Sometimes this was my job too, but more often I 
was paper-hunting. 

Paper in London^-since the beginning of the 
war, has been as difficult to find as happiness. In 
price it went up gradually to about a thousand per 
cent, in quantity it was negligible, in quality it 
degenerated into a bitter joke. I have occasionally 
been almost offended by the sight of Mrs. Mary 
Ann helpless with laughter over paper which I 
have bought, so to speak, with my life's blood. Was 
it for this that I had played upon the difficult heart- 
strings of Jewish wholesale dealers, for this that 
I had come, splashing through grey wet snow or 
panting through the heat, with paper whose price 
was above the price of rubies, three or four glorious 
reams of it, flopping like jelly on a borrowed coster- 
barrow? Mrs. Mary Ann and the barrer-chaps 
could see in it nothing but a joke ; they would stick 



their fingers wittily through it to show its in- 
feriority. Monsieur Jacques, the antique-chair- 
maker, would hurry from his basement, followed 
always by a gust of chickens which he incorrigibly 
kept in coops under his bed to join in the fun. 
Mr. Bill Watson, the lodger on the top floor, who 
earned five pounds a week at " night work," and 
kept a gramaphone and a fat lady friend in his front 
room and a starved wife and children at the back, 
would kick a ricketty child downstairs to ask when 
we were going to allow a little . . . sleep to 
_a man who'd been all night serving his ... 
country. Young Ninny, Mrs. Mary Ann's adopted 
daughter, aged seven, would feel called upon to 
rebuke her circle for its levity on a serious matter. 

" 'Ere, 'ere, ma, less of it. 'Pears to me as it 
ain't no blasted joke. We got ter live on this giddy 
rubbish, an' bread gawn up another farden to-diy." 

Mrs. Mary Ann is always at the mercy of some 
adopted relation or other. She has spent all her 
years of comparative discretion in adopting chil- 
dren, and in quarreling with them when they 
reached an age likely to be useful to her. The cause 
of the quarrels, I noticed, was always their jealousy 
of successors. It is obviously unbearable, after being 
for years the adopted apple of an eye, to return 
one evening and find a fresh apple suddenly blossom- 
ing on the stem. And never respectable blossoms 
either. Forlorn babies touch an insane spot in Mrs. 
Mary Ann's heart. Girls " expecting their trouble " 
gravitate towards her, and inevitably disappear in 
due course, leaving their " troubles " to be a dif- 
ficulty and a delight to Mrs. Mary Ann. 

The whole of our coster clientele is m our con- 
fidence on these and other matters, and in return 
our customers make of our shop something, I think, 
akin to the salon so much desired by other women. 
Mrs. Mary Ann has no culture, only a smile to 
share. She seldom goes out to explore the world ; 
no newspapers enter the shop except those which 
wrap up the tripe, and even those are read by no- 
one but Young Ninny. But, for her talk among 
her friends, possibly Mrs. Mary Ann finds in the 
unique tree on which her eyes are so often fixed, a 
source of sane inspiration. 

In the matter of the European War, I am glad 
to say that she expresses a detached and sober 
sympathy with the Allies. She has, of course, seen 
the more blatant and personal side of war. she 
has watched the doves of war climbing her horizon 
over the unique tree to disseminate their curious 
gospel. The dreadful bodies of friends and custom- 
ers have been laid upon her doorstep her doorstep 
which they used to cross with their great coster 
laughter. Every night, sometimes for seven nights 
on end, has she been awakened to the nightmare task 



1919 



THE DIAL 



of wrapping up the hysterical Young Ninny, and 
despatching her through the ominous and deserted 
streets to official shelter, whither Mrs. Mary Ann 
herself would follow on slow and groping crutches, 
to the tune of the first bombs. 

The coster race was slow to declare war on 
Germany. It was instinctively neutral. Life in the 
Brown Borough is so acutely personal that the en- 
tire outside world is looked upon as a thing un- 
proven. A row somewhere down Europe way is 
no row, only something that enlarges the headlines 
of newspapers from which we ask no more than 
the necessary betting news. War was declared and 
became at once disagreeably domestic: the wet fruit 
season was absolutely ruined by the mobilization 
order, which, as far as the trade was concerned, 
simply wiped the railways off the map. The coster 
is proudly unskilled, he looks upon the trained 
artisan in very much the same way as many of us 
look upon the University Don " Dreadfully 
clever no doubt, but Lord what a life." The 
coster has never failed, until 1914, to pick up easy 
money in the street. Now suddenly there was no 
trade in the streets only soldiers and ominous news- 
posters, there was no audience for the coster cry, 
that cracked tenor call that changes like a bird's with 
the season " Buy, buy, buy, fresh plums a-fine 
Oh." 

The donkey grew thin, the missus and kids 
hungry, the master himself perpetually thirsty. He 
wanted, of course, to push in somebody's face about 
it, and pushed in, as a matter of course, the face of 
any German he met. But that didn't seem to help 
much. Where was Flanders, anyway? Evidently 
some inconsiderable spot on the further side of the 
Mile End Road. " Why (Didn't they cop this . . . 
Kayser? They're quick enough to put you an' me 
away for a ... sight less." The government was 
obviously to blame as usual, making the walls look 
silly with red, white, and blue nonsense " Your 
King and Country Need YOU." What for? 
" More likely we need 'im. 'Pears to me its about 
time 'e did somethink." 

" Prince of Wales money " was given away at 
the Town Hall, but few costers applied for it. You 
had to tell your whole life's history for a quid or 
two, and a coster's life's history, as he knows, is not 
the kind that appeals to social workers, who like 
best quiet teetotal people who work indoors. 

In May 1915 the Brown Borough enjoyed a 
special and private revelation. Five incredible in- 
cendiary bombs were dropped upon it suddenly, out 
of a starry sky. 

The Brown Borough knew at once what to do. 
This really was a row up our street now, not a 
newspaper affair. Immense queues of men formed 



outside the Town Hall recruiting office that day, 
under the very shadow of the smoke from their burnt 
houses. Costers fell into war as into a black pit, 
and were no more heard of. 

Just at first the women amused themselves with 
anti-German riots. They were not accustomed to 
being left out of rows, and wrecking bakers was a 
fine lark. I regret to add that it was a paying lark 
too, the price of bread having gone up. Mrs. Mary 
Ann never approved of it. 

" Blasted nonsense," she said, splashing paste 
irritably all over her visitors in a fever of industry. 
" Ain't pore Mrs. Klein pore Mrs. Klein still, 
War or no War. A pore thing, I grant you, lettin' 
the Parish fetch up 'er children the ones she didn' 
manage to bury first but all the sime, as 'armless as 
a suckling dove. The War ain't bin an' turned 'er 
into a rampagin' lion, 'as it? T'ain't as if she ever 
'ad any truck with the Kayser. . ." 

So the costers, who always loved a row, joined in 
the Super-Row, far beyond the Mile End Road. 
At home business has looked up again. Come what 
may, the fruit must ripen in the orchards and gravi- 
tate towards the hungry city. The donkey and 
barrow still decorate the curb outside our shop, and 
in the barrow sits the missus, laughing and bellig- 
erent still, wearing a little crepe band round her 
arm, and a little cold War Office notice over her 
heart. There have been many nights when Mrs. 
Mary Ann and Young Ninny got no sleep. To her 
ground floor front, whither the " ole man " used to 
come with his jokes, his missus comes now to hide 
her tears on a good comforter's pillow. 

" This War don't seem to get no better," said 
Mr. Stevens, our veteran customer, at the same 
time pressing into my hand half a crown for the 
benefit of the War in question. He has been used 
to obliging his friends with gifts, though never with 
loans, and he is therefore willing, when business is 
good, to tip the Chancellor of the Exchequer half 
a crown a week, if Mrs. Mary Ann assures him 
that the cause is good. Money in his view is either 
kept in the pocket or given away; he cannot bear 
to have the matter mentioned again, or to find an 
insidious dividend trying to creep back into his 
pocket. " This War don't seem to get no better. 
Almost 'pears to me like the more money I puts 
into it, the worse it gets. There's my boy Bill's 
boy Elbert gawn now; the War Office sent Bill 
word last night." 

" Ow, shut yer 'ead about the War an' Bill's 
boy," said Mrs. Mary Ann, whose emotions are 
mostly clothed in the guise of anger. " Bill's boy's 
luckier nor most, anyway. 'Es managed to do 
a good day's work, an' get a good night's rest after 
it, for once ! "

But when the chastened Mr. Stevens retreated, 
leaving with me a double contribution to the War, 
by way of reparation for his lapse in tact, Mrs. 
Mary Ann threw the paste-brush down, and laid 
her arms on a bulwark of bags, and her head on her 
arms. 



"Bill's boy gawn. . ." she said. "All the 
chaps gawn. English or German it don't seem to 
make no difference. By Gawd, it's got to be a 
pretty fair peace, for to make this 'ere War worth 
while." 

STELLA BENSON. 



Bolshevik Russia and Jacobin France 



o FAR THERE HAS BEEN little adequate apprecia- 
tion of the spiritual kinship between the French 
and Russian Revolutions. Those who form their 
impressions of Soviet Russia from the testimony 
before the Overman Committee and similar sources 
naturally see nothing in the Bolshevik upheaval 
except a gigantic and altogether unparalleled out- 
burst of criminal lunacy. Apologists and sympa- 
thizers with revolutionary Russia sometimes cite 
the French Reign of Terror as a precedent for the 
excesses of the Bolsheviki; but here their sense of 
historical resemblance seems to stop. 

Now the use of terror is one of the least signif- 
icant of the many features which are common to 
the two great revolutions. Both in general form 
and in minute detail there is a striking likeness be- 
tween the completed structure of revolutionary 
France and the incomplete edifice which is still 
being built up in Russia. This likeness is especially 
marked in the closing stages of the two movements, 
in the period dominated in France by the Jacobins, 
in Russia by the Bolsheviki. Both revolutions were 
directed against peculiarly abominable systems of 
tyranny and injustice. Both, at their inception, 
won the admiration and sympathy of the whole 
world by their moderation and bloodlessness. In 
each case sympathy and admiration were gradually 
transformed into disgust and horror as the up- 
heaval assumed more and more violent aspects, 
sweeping away one cherished tradition after an- 
other in a hurricane of blood and fire. 

Alike in Russia and in France there was a time 
when it seemed that the abuses of the old regime 
might be gradually removed without recourse to 
violence, civil war, and the definite alignment of 
class against class. The end of this period in 
France was marked by the expulsion of the Giron- 
dist deputies from the Convention in June 1793; 
in Russia it was signalized by the overthrow of the 
Kerensky government and the subsequent dissolu- 
tion of the Constituent Assembly. In France this 
transition period occupied nearly four years ; in Rus- 
sia only eight months elapsed between the down- 
fall of the Czar and the Bolshevist coup. This ac- 
celeration of the last stage of the revolution in Rus- 
sia can be accounted for by the pressure of the 



War and the weakness of the Kerensky government. 

Judged by any abstract theoretical standard the 
sailors who dispersed the Constituent Assembly and 
the armed Parisian mob which forced the Conven- 
tion to expel its Girondist deputies committed an 
outrageous violation of all democratic principles. 
And yet it is difficult not to feel that both these acts, 
violent and arbitrary as they were, marked an in- 
evitable forward step in the advance of the two 
revolutions. It was only after the exclusion of the 
Girondists that the feudal dues were definitely and 
completely abolished, that adequate steps were taken 
to confiscate the huge estates of the emigres and 
divide them up among the poverty-stricken peasants. 
In the same way it was only after the transfer of 
power to the Soviets that the Land Law, with its 
companion pieces of social legislation, came into 
being. There is still another fact, usually ignored 
or glossed over by conservative observers, which 
must be taken into consideration. France in 1793, 
like Russia in 1917, was living under the perpetual 
shadow of a possible counter-revolution. Had the 
plots of Kornilov and the French royalists suc- 
ceeded, the most moderate social and political re- 
forms would certainly have been swept away in a 
torrent of reaction. That they did not succeed was 
chiefly due to the stern and inflexible revolutionists 
who snatched the power away from the vacillating 
Kerensky and the unreliable Girondist. 

Bolshevik Russia and Jacobin France were both 
compelled to face large armies of foreign enemies. 
In each case there was the same underlying motive 
for intervention the instinctive jealous hostility of 
the established order towards a new movement 
which seemed to threaten the very foundations of 
society with destruction. The effects of interven- 
tion were also quite similar. Foreign invasion pro- 
duced an extraordinary, almost a miraculous, re- 
crudescence of fighting spirit in the French and Rus- 
sian peoples. There is a dramatic contrast indeed 
between the royalist French army which fled in dis- 
graceful panic before a handful of Prussians at 
Rossbach and the revolutionary levies that hurled 
back the superior forces of the coalition at Valmy 
and Jemmapes. And 'there is an equally striking 
contrast between the helpless, disorderly mob that 



1919 



THE DIAL 



threw down its arms and refused to fight before 
Brest-Litovsk and the resolute, effective Red Army 
that drove the Czecho-Slovaks from the Volga and 
the French from the Ukraine. It is quite true that, 
in Russia and France alike, the revolutionary gov- 
ernments employed conscription in raising their 
armies. But it is equally true that conscription 
would have proved altogether ineffective in prac- 
tice if it had not been supported by a spirit of 
ardent and unquenchable popular enthusiasm. 

Another effect of intervention, regrettable but in- 
evitable, was an appalling increase in the use of 
terror on the part of the revolutionists. The most 
abominable cruelties of the French Revolution, the 
September Massacres, the drownings at Nantes, the 
wholesale shootings at Lyons and Toulon, can be di- 
rectly ascribed to the presence or proximity of 
foreign invaders. It was certainly no mere coinci- 
dence that the worst acts of the much exaggerated 
Red Terror in Russia were committed during the 
late summer of 1918, when it seemed that any day 
might witness the fall of the Soviet Republic before 
the Allied and Czecho-Slovak armies. It is impos- 
sible to justify deeds of ruthless violence and terror- 
ism under any conditions. But, when we recall the 
hysterical eagerness with which certain elements in 
our own country seized upon every opportunity to 
persecute real and imaginary cases of " pro-Ger- 
manism," it is surely easy to understand the frenzy 
that possessed the ignorant, oppressed French and 
Russian masses when they saw their revolution, their 
only hope of a better future, assailed and threatened 
with extinction by hosts of foreign bayonets. 

The characters of the Bolshevik and Jacobin 
leaders are generally cast in a common mold. With 
few exceptions they are men fanatically devoted to 
their ideals, reckless of their own lives, and of the 
lives of others, supremely disinterested, and through 
this very disinterestedness devoid of pity for those 
whom they consider enemies of the revolution. 
Among them, as among the English Puritans of the 
seventeenth century, the most burning enthusiasm 
for a doctrinaire ideal is often combined with great 
shrewdness and practical sagacity. Coming down 
to specific examples, the resemblance between Lenin 
and Robespierre is unmistakable. The Russian is 
a devotee of Karl Marx; the Frenchman an ardent 
worshiper of Rousseau. Both men are character- 
ized by inflexible will-power, and by a personal in- 
tegrity that extorts the reluctant admiration of their 
bitterest enemies. Lenin has a more enlightened 
mind, a wider international background. Perhaps 
the best proof of his mental superiority lies in the 
fact that he has never fallen a victim to Robes- 
pierre's fatal delusion that terror is an effective 
means of securing the fruits of revolution. Yet in 



essential outlines the two types of character are 
quite similar. In the same way a forerunner of 
^Trotzky appears in St. Just, the fiery young en- 
thusiast whose boundless energy and passionate elo- 
quence contributed so much to the organization and 
victories of the revolutionary armies. 

Russia, like France, has had her emigres; and 
here again the parallel is obvious. The Russian 
grand dukes, like the French nobles, are naively con- 
vinced that their regime of cruelty and rapacity, ex- 
travagance and oppression has somehow endeared 
them to the masses of the common people. The 
whole revolution, in their eyes, is the work of a few 
bad men, anarchists, criminals ; all that is needed to 
destroy it is a little modest outside help in men and 
money. In Russian and French aristocrats alike is 
found the same inability to appreciate realities, the 
same ferocious hatred of their own people, the same 
disgraceful willingness to make any sacrifice of their 
country's peace and happiness that may help to give 
them back their old privileges and possessions. 
Prince Lvov and his associates in Paris protesting 
against every suggestion to relieve starvation in Bol- 
shevist Russia are worthy successors of the French 
emigres who applauded the savage and bloodthirsty 
manifestoes of the Duke of Brunswick from their 
safe retreat at Coblenz. In exile as in power the 
Russian and French ruling classes consistently up- 
hold their previous record of cruelty and selfishness. 

Jacobins and Bolsheviki alike were called upon to 
face the most difficult and exacting problems of 
administration. They were obliged simultaneously 
to repress domestic plots, to repulse foreign in- 
vasion, to save their people from absolute starvation 
as a result of the abnormal conditions created by 
war, revolution, and previous maladministration. 
That they succeeded in maintaining their hold upon 
the government in the face of all these obstacles was 
not due solely, or even primarily, to the remarkable 
organizing capacity of some of their leaders. It was 
due rather to the intensely active cooperation of the 
revolutionary elements among the masses. In Rus- 
sia these masses organized themselves in local so- 
viets. In France they created the patriotic societies 
which radiated all over the country from the Ja- 
cobin stronghold -of Paris. These active popular 
bodies formed the very backbone of the French and 
Russian Revolutions. Out of them came the best 
soldiers for the armies, the best workmen for the 
factories. It was due to their vigorous exertions 
that the supply of food and clothing and munitions 
was somehow kept up, that both revolutions did not 
perish in a welter of sheer chaos and anarchy. 

Both movements temporarily inaugurated a new 
style of diplomacy. The fundamental spirit of 
Tchitcherin's recklessly unconventional state papers 



i6 



THE DIAL 



July 12 



is summed up in the famous announcement of the 
Convention that it was " the friend of all peoples 
and the enemy of all governments." In consistently- 
making desperate and more or less successful efforts 
to supplement arms with propaganda, to break the 
iron ring of their enemies by fomenting domestic 
uprisings, the Bolsheviki are only following in the 
footsteps of the Jacobins. Other points of resem- 
blance between the two movements are a pro- 
nounced anticlerical tendency, a passionate fondness 
for fetes and celebrations, an ardent and almost 
pathetic zeal for the speedy diffusion of enlighten- 
ment among the illiterate masses. 

The French and Russian Revolutions both have 
their dark and bloody aspects. Through both there 
runs a strain of fierce fanaticism, the natural pro- 
duct of cruel and prolonged repression. This fanati- 
cism often finds expression in acts of shocking and 
senseless brutality. Revolution, like war, makes 
men dangerously susceptible to the passions of sus- 
picion, intolerance, and mob violence. The fruits of 
the French Revolution were partially lost through 
its excesses. Russia may have a similar experience. 
But, whatever the crimes and mistakes of the Jaco- 
bins and the Bolsheviki, the reactionary legends that 
represent them as monsters of unmitigated iniquity 
are certainly very far from the truth. To their ac- 
count must be laid not only the terror, but also 



nearly all the glorious positive achievements that are 
associated with the two great modern efforts to 
realize a freer and better world. If, in the course 
of the struggle, they often had recourse to stern and 
bloody methods, it should be remembered that, in 
this respect, their opponents were equally guilty. 
The Vendean counter-revolutionists of 1792, like 
Kolchak's Cossacks today, were notorious for their 
remorseless and diabolical savagery. French and 
Russian revolutionists alike were animated by the 
loftiest ideals, ideals that are admirably expressed in 
the great blazing watchword: Liberty, Equality, 
Fraternity. And, though these ideals might be often 
forgotten or trampled under foot in the heat and 
fury of a desperate civil and foreign war, yet some- 
how they impress upon both movements an unmis- 
takable character of beauty and nobility. Jacobin 
France did not develop into Rousseau's ideal 
state; yet there are few intelligent Frenchmen who 
would wish to see the years of the Revolution 
blotted from their country's history. Bolshevik Rus- 
sia will probably not evolve into the perfect Marx- 
ian commonwealth; but future history will scarcely 
deny that the Russian Revolution played a part, and 
a very important part, in the advance of the human 
race towards spiritual and material freedom.

Chapters in Southern History 



.BOUT A SCORE of the projected fifty volumes of 
the Chronicles of America, issued by the Yale Uni- 
versity Press under the editorship of Professor Allen 
Johnson, 'have now been delivered to subscribers, 
and the critic may fairly judge how faithfully the 
series promises to fulfill the specifications of the 
prospectus: "To present the entire history of our 
country in the living form of a series of short narra- 
tives, each having a unity of its own but all articu- 
lated and so related that the reader will not only be 
entertained by the story in each volume, but will 
also be given a real vision of the development of this 
country from the beginning to the present day . . . 
to make the traditions of our nation more real and 
vivid to those of our citizens who are' not in the 
habit of reading history." Brevity, consistency, and 
vividness are the qualities, then, which are 
counted on to recommend the Chronicles to a public 
heretofore indifferent to the blandishments of 
Clio. 

It must be admitted that the volumes already 
published go far towards vindicating the claims of 
the prospectus. They average little more than 200 
pages of little more than 200 words each. They 



deal with topics, with tendencies, movements, crises, 
in our history, rather than with decades or periods 
(so that the title of Chronicles, if taken literally, is 
rather a misnomer). The editor has gone outside 
the guild of professional historians to find authors 
for many of the volumes, pressing into service 
economists, sociologists, publicists, poets, and 
novelists. Samuel P. Orth, Edwin E. Slosson, 
Bliss Perry, Mary Johnston, Stewart Edward 
White, and Emerson Hough are among the con- 
tributors. There is no embarrassing apparatus of 
learned footnotes referring to volume and page of 
weighty government documents to frighten away 
that very desirable but rather wary customer, " the 
general reader." A comparison of the Chronicles 
with Professor Hart's American Nation series, 
published only a few years ago, will suggest itself 
to every student of American history and will con- 
firm the judgment of the more popular character 
of the Chronicles. The volumes of the American 
Nation are double the size of the Chronicles of 
America. They deal almost without exception with 
chronological epochs of about a decade each, and 
emphasize almost exclusively the political and 



1919 



THE DIAL 



economic events of those epochs. They are all 
written by scientific historians and are equipped 
with an abundance of learned apparatus. They 
are written for students first of all, with a cordial 
invitation for the general reader to share them; 
whereas the Chronicles are written for the general 
reader, but not without a full sense of responsibility 
for furnishing him with reliable as well as enter- 
taining reading. 

In spite of the attractiveness of titles and authors, 
however, and in spite of the lure of vivid pages and 
few, the publishers have endangered the popular 
reception of the Chronicles by launching the series 
in an edition de luxe (which had far more appro- 
priately been called the J. P. Morgan edition than 
the Abraham Lincoln edition) in unbroken sub- 
scription sets of fifty volumes at $3.50 a volume net. 
What proportion of " our citizens who are not in 
the habit of reading history " will be tempted to 
tackle a work of 10,000 pages in order to get 
acquainted with " the traditions of our nation," or 
will be able to pay $175 for the privilege, we are 
not prepared to say but we think it cannot be large. 

Three of the volumes just issued lie before us. 
They deal with aspects of the great crisis of our 
national history, the secession of the slaveholding 
states, and are entitled respectively: The Cotton 
Kingdom, by William E. Dodd; The Anti-Slavery 
Crusade, by Jesse Macy; The Day of the Con- 
federacy, by Nathaniel W. Stephenson. Professor 
Dodd's book (in reality an essay of less than 150 
pages is a gem of conciseness, clarity, and con- 
sistency. It is devoted to the demonstration of the 
double consequence of the rise of the great cotton 
planters to a dominating position in the lower South, 
namely: the growing solidarity of opinion, political, 
philosophical, educational, religious, South of Mason 
and Dixon's line in favor of the extreme pro-slavery 
arguments; and the crystallization of society in the 
South into the static orders or castes of gentlemen, 
farmers, and slaves. Professor Dodd shows how 
inevitably geographical, climatic, and commercial 
conditions led to the rise of the great cotton 
magnates of the lower South, and how inevitably 
their establishment in the seats of social and political 
power was accompanied by a philosophy and ethics 
quite differently disposed toward slavery than the 
Jeffersonian abolitionism. President Thomas R. 
Dew, of the venerable college of William and 
Mary, announced the new slavery apologetics in 
his famous Report of the debates of the Virginia 
legislature of 1831-32: " It is the order of nature 
and of God that the being of superior faculties and 
knowledge, and therefore of superior power, should 
control and dispose of those who are inferior. It 
is as much in the order of nature that men should 



enslave each other as that other animals should prey 
upon each other." However shocking to finer 
sensibilities this brutal frankness of language (so 
direct a reminder of the biological arguments for the 
right of might which we have lately read in cer- 
tain German apologetics), nevertheless effective op- 
position to the realization of the slaveholders' 
stratified and static social system disappeared from 
the council halls, the churches, the schools of the 
South. " The social philosophy which began with 
the repudiation of the Declaration of Independence 
ended with the explicit recognition of social in- 
equality " (page 146). 

Professor Macy's volume on the Anti-Slavery 
Crusade is modeled on the abolitionist histories 
of half a century ago. The political philosophy 
and the constitutional theory of the Free Soil 
Party are assumed without argument or apology. 
For example, the object of the propaganda for the 
admission of Texas was " the extension of slave 
territory" purely and simply (page 17) ; the Whig 
Party went to pieces on the one jagged rock of the 
odious Fugitive Slave Act (page in) ; Clay's elet- 
tion in 1844 would probably have resulted in the 
same fateful sequence of events the annexation of 
Texas, the War with Mexico, the supersession of the 
Missouri Compromise as did the election of Polk 
(page 90). Professor Macy finds nothing exasperat- 
ing in the personality of Charles Sumner and little 
culpable in the behavior of John Brown (to whom 
an absurdly disproportionate amount of space is 
devoted). In most respects the volume is in sharp 
contrast to Professor Dodd's. It is descriptive 
rather than suggestive, diffuse rather than concise, 
without any crispness in style or freshness of matter, 
anot occasionally erroneous in its statements as 
when it says that Calhoun " declared himself pre- 
pared to dissolve the Union rather than submit to 
a protective tariff" (page 100), that the Missouri 
Compromise was " a question of the extension of 
slavery in the States" (page 30), that Abraham Lin- 
coln uttered his famous sentence "A house divided 
against itself cannot stand " in the debates with 
Douglas for the senatorship (page 201). 

However it is not on the contrast of these two 
volumes that we wish to dwell here, but rather 
on their remarkable coincidence of judgment on a 
certain point. Both the venerable Grinell professor, 
of abolitionist antecedents, and the native son of 
North Carolina, who taught for several years in 
the Virginia College of Randolph-Macon, agree that 
the turning point in the attitude of the South to- 
wards abolition was that debate in the Virginia 
legislature whose Report by Thomas Dew we have 
already noticed. After that, says Macy, " there 
were few owners of slaves who publicly advocated

abolition '. . . and the only recourse left 
seemed to be to follow the example of James G. 
Birney and leave the South or to submit in silence to 
the new order" (page 66) . These words could as well 
have been in Professor Dodd's book, so thoroughly 
do they support his thesis of the submission of the 
upper South to the dictation of the cotton magnates 
after the close of the third decade of the nineteenth 
century. They show too how futile and pathetic 
were the protests of Virginia Whigs like Governor 
Wise and John Tyler against the tide that was 
sucking the Old Dominion down into the abysmal 
depths of the cotton magnates' demands; and how 
insincere or partisan-blinded is the determined re- 
iteration of John Tyler's son and biographer that 
Southern men of influence ceased denouncing 
slavery after the early thirties only because they were 
unwilling to " play into the hands of their bitterest 
enemies," the abolitionists, and that Virginia 
already beginning to discover that her " most 
profitable product was the slave who could be sold " 
(Dodd, page 9) was compelled by these diaboli- 
cal abolitionists to defend " an institution which she 
would have gladly sacrificed if left alone !" (Tyler's 
Tyler, Vol. I, pages 155, 15?). We may applaud 
high-minded Virginians for their shame and re- 
sentment at seeing their state bound to the chariot 
wheels of the barons of the lower South, but we 
cannot approve their ostrichlike policy of plunging 
their heads into the sands of interminable meta- 
physical arguments on states rights to hide the 
facts. 

For Professor Stephenson's volume on The Day 
of the Confederacy there can be only the highest 
praise. It fulfils admirably every condition pre- 
scribed for the Chronicles, and of all the books of 
the series that we have examined thus far it seems 
most distinctly a contribution to historical knowledge. 
We have the older, ponderous, apologetical histories 
of the Confederate cause by Davis, Stephens, and 
others; we have the ordinary accounts of the mili- 
tary vicissitudes and the economic exhaustion of the 
Confederacy in our various histories of the Civil 
War ; we have an admirable account of the financial 
and commercial fortunes of the South of the war 
times in J. C. Schwab's The Confederate States of 
America. But till now we have had no succinct 
account of the intimate problems of Jefferson Davis* 
Government, of the reaction of the military fortunes 
on the Congress and the people, of the opposition to 
President Davis and Secretary Benjamin in the 
public assemblies and" the press, of the resistance 
to conscription, food requisitions, the arming of 
the negroes, the suspension of the writ of habeas 
corpus, of the antagonism of the " sovereign states " 



to the " despotic " centralized government at Rich- 
mond, of the recalling of state militias from the 
Confederate army, of the mercurial fluctuations of 
hope and despair which followed the reports from 
Southern agents abroad, and of the desperate 
measures which preceded the final disintegration 
of the resources and hopes of the Confederacy. 

All this and much more is presented in a story 
of exceptional discrimination and graphic style by 
Professor Stephenson. Southern scholars will per- 
haps find his estimate of Jefferson Davis' character 
and talents too low. " Integrity, courage, faith- 
fulness, and zeal " are granted to the president of 
the Confederacy, but he " lacked that insight into 
human life which marks the genius of the supreme 
executive," he had " a dangerous bent towards 
bureaucracy," " he lacked humor," " his mind was 
dogmatic," he was too little appreciative of the work 
of his great generals and was even jealous of their 
military laurels, he " was not always wise in his 
choice of men," he refused to recognize the logic of 
facts, and his mind " crystallized " at last in a 
dogged belief in the invincibility of the Southern 
cause on the very eve of its downfall (pages 68, 69, 
182, 196, 200). Students will find a much more 
favorable estimate of President Davis in Mr. 
Armistead C. Gordon's new biography in the series 
of Figures from American History (Scribner, 
1918). 

To return for a last word to the series as a 
whole, a cooperative work like the Chronicles is 
subject to many disadvantages. Not only is there 
the inevitable disparity in the quality of the various 
authors' contributions, but there is a constant danger 
of repetition. This is especially true in a series in 
which chronological metes and bounds are neglected 
for the sake of topical developments. The volumes 
of Professor Macy and Dodd, for example, cover 
a larger amount of common ground chronologically, 
and both have to deal with the political events of 
the forties and the fifties. Of course the approach 
is from widely different directions, and the expert 
reader realizes that what may seem contradictory 
to the " citizens who are not in the habit of reading 
history " is in reality only supplementary or correc- 
tive. Editorial watchfulness alone can reduce to a 
minimum the friction from this source. If subse- 
quent volumes of the Chronicles maintain the high 
standard set by the great majority of those which 
have already appeared the enterprise will deserve 
only the highest commendation and will leave noth- 
ing to be desired but the hasty adaptation of the 
volumes to the pocketbook of the common man.

Uncertain, But Hopeful 



NCERTAIN, BUT HOPEFUL " would have ex- 
pressed the feeling of the Japanese press and pub- 
licists toward the prospects of Mr. Kara and the 
party cabinet which he organized late last Septem- 
ber. Now, after the close of the Diet a " disgust- 
ingly quiet " session, according to one paper he 
faces peculiar administrative problems, and the atti- 
tude still is " uncertain, but hopeful." 

Count Terauchi's resignation was hailed with joy. 
He had been chosen two years previously as frankly 
one of the military group, and in the hope that he 
could dominate his own party. He failed in this, 
and also failed to win popular support. The cli- 
max came with the rice riots; those curious, half 
economic, half political disturbances of August and 
September. The time was ripe for a change. 
Many demanded a pure party government. The 
aged, liberal-minded Marquis Saionji forced the 
hands of the militarists by refusing the premiership 
for himself and recommending the head of the domi- 
nant political party in the Diet, Mr. K. Hara. 
There was no alternative. The militarists, repre- 
sented by Count Terauchi, had failed to provide a 
satisfactory government, and out of their failure 
came the opportunity for what promised to be a 
real forward step in constitutional government in 
Japan. 

Mr. Hara got together Japan's first party cabi- 
net. He has been in the saddle for half a year 
now, and there is no immediate prospect of his 
being busted. 

I say " in the saddle " instead of " in control " 
advisedly. The military group failed to prevent 
his selection as head of the Government, but its 
power still is great. At least it is only on the 
assumption of a divided authority in Tokyo that 
one can get any clue to certain inconsistencies in 
Japan's policy and the acts of various Japanese 
officials. 

The matter of free speech offers a good illus- 
tration. One of the most bitter indictments which 
the press laid against Count Terauchi related to 
the rigid police prohibitions and suppressions of 
various news items and of popular discussion. Mr. 
Hara promised to change this. He has done so to a 
large extent, in the matter of public meetings. But 
apparently the police control of news and of editorial 
comment is as rigid as ever though now the re- 
strictions come in the form of " advice " rather 
than of prohibition. One hesitates to criticize, how- 
ever, when he remembers that the police have had 
decades of training in suppressing to months of ex- 



perience in granting freedom. Yet it is curious 
that, as far as one somewhat on the outside can 
learn, the items suppressed relate chiefly to matters 
involving the military authorities. 

The relations with China show a more serious 
result of the double government. Mr. Hara be- 
gan by promising a new policy of friendliness, par- 
ticularly in helping China to cure her civil ills. 
Loans from Japan had been used largely by the 
Northern militarists against the South; so there 
would be no more loans. China's " model army " 
was being used against the South instead of as a 
defense along the Russian border; therefore sup- 
plies and arms for this army would no longer be 
sent from Japan. China should be free to present 
her claims at the Peace Conference; accordingly 
Japan would make no effort to control her acts. 
These were the promises. 

No more loans, have been made. But in other 
ways it has seemed at times exasperatingly as though 
there had been no change in policy. 

Tang Shao-yi, leader of the Southern delegation 
at the , Chinese peace conference at Shanghai, pro- 
tested the continued shipment of arms to the North. 
An inquiry revealed that in spite of the Cabinet's 
promise, and quite without its knowledge, arms had 
continued to go forward as before, with the sanc- 
tion of the general staff. Here was a clear case of 
conflicting authority. Mr. Hara acted promptly 
and vigorously. The shipments of arms were 
stopped presumably really stopped this time and 
certain offending Japanese army officials in China 
were recalled. Mr. Hara seems to have won this 
open clash with the militarists. 

Then there is the matter of the secret documents. 
The Chinese delegates at Paris called the attention 
of the Conference to the existence of various secret 
agreements which they alleged Japan had forced on 
China. Promptly Mr. Obata, the Japanese minis- 
ter at Pekin, called at the Chinese foreign office, 
stated that Japan had a million men under arms 
and a large navy and merchant fleet, and then " ad- 
vised " China that it was against diplomatic prece- 
dent for one party to a secret agreement to disclose 
that agreement without the other party's consent. 
This threat aroused a furor in both the foreign 
and the native press in China. Mr. Obata explained 
that he had acted at the request of the Japanese 
delegates at Paris, and without instructions from 
Tokyo. Then a little later, after receiving a de- 
layed telegraphic report of an interview given out 
by Viscount Chinda at Paris, he flatly contradicted 



20 



THE DIAL 



July 12 



himself by saying he had acted under orders direct 
from his home Government. Evidently something 
was wrong under the surface. But the incident 
strengthened neither Mr. Obata nor Japan in the 
eyes of China. 

Subsequently, publication in full of all the agree- 
ments was promised. They have not appeared yet, 
except for one or two which have been issued only 
semi-officially and with no statement from authori- 
tative sources that these are all, nor even that the 
complete text of those published has appeared. One 
wonders about this, because there is no apparent 
reason for secrecy in what has been given to the 
press. 

Mr. Hara's course has not been entirely smooth. 
Certain things he has accomplished however; cer- 
tain constructive, forward-looking things. I have 
already spoken of his clash with the militarists 
about the shipment of arms to China. He had 
come into direct but less open conflict with them 
earlier, in connection with the selection of the chief 
delegate to the Peace Conference and here also he 
had been successful. 

In many ways Viscount Kato seemed the logical 
choice for this position. He was Foreign Minister 
when Japan entered the war, he has served as am- 
bassador with great success, and he is head of the 
leading opposition party in the Diet. The mili- 
tarist papers were loud in their demand that he be 
Japan's chief representative. But he also is the 
man responsible for the notorious Twenty-One De- 
mands on China, and he has otherwise proven him- 
self a strong imperialist. One can quite under- 
stand why the military group sought his appoint- 
ment, and also why Mr. Kara preferred Marquis 
Saionji. Ever since his boyhood, when he was a 
school fellow of Clemenceau in France, this Elder 
Statesman has been consistently liberal and pro- 
gressive in all his political efforts. 

Marquis Saionji was chosen, with Baron Makino, 
another liberal, as his chief second. 

Another kind of success came to Mr. Hara with 
the passage of the electoral reform bill. This 
time there was no contest with the militarists, but 
only with a half-hearted opposition in the Diet. 
The chief features of the new bill are that it 
greatly increases the number of " single member " 
districts, and, more important, that it reduces ma- 
terially the tax-paying qualification for franchise and 
so doubles the number of voters and gives a voice 
in the government to practically the entire middle 
class. The proportion of voters still is small, com- 
pared with Western states, but this bill is a definite 
step forward. 

Recently a curious phenomenon has appeared in 



the Japanese press a violent burst of anti-Ameri- 
canism. One is much at a loss to understand this. 
There has been more or less talk ever since the 
opening of armistice negotiations with Germany, es- 
pecially in the militarist papers, to the effect that 
Japan must keep up her army and navy and must 
watch America's " aggression " in the East with 
great care, now that America has shown herself 
in her true light as a militaristic, imperialistic na- 
tion. If these papers didn't take it all so seriously, 
one would be rather amused at the violence of the 
tone, sometimes. Whether justified or not, one 
tends to find something more than coincidence in 
the fact that this anti-American campaign increased 
in vigor immediately after the prospect of a work- 
ing league of nations became definite, and grew 
still more intense when it was proposed to abolish 
conscription throughout the world. The achieve- 
ment of either of these immediately would close the 
career of power of the militarists in Japan. Their 
only hope is to stir the people by creating the bogey 
of a potential foe. No nation but America is avail- 
able for this purpose. And a certain plausibility is 
lent to their arguments by the fact that America 
did develop a great army in a remarkably short 
time, that she has tremendous economic resources, 
and that she is turning to the Orient for com- 
mercial expansion. Also, their cause has been 
helped on by the past and present statements of 
certain American senators. The end of this is 
not yet. 

But to return to Mr. Hara. Now that the Diet 
is up, and he is free to turn his Attention more 
exclusively to administrative problems, we shall 
have a new test of his ability. There are grave 
problems ahead of Japan as of other nations. Korea 
is presenting an alarming spectacle, especially from 
the Japanese point of view. Unemployment and a 
serious business depression are growing specters 
resulting not from demobilization but from the col- 
lapse of hundreds of flimsily, hastily established 
shipbuilding and manufacturing concerns. And the 
cost of living still is exorbitant. 

There is no doubt of Mr. Hara's ideals or de- 
sires. The only question is of his power to control 
rather than be controlled by the military group. If 
he succeeds, and can remain at the helm for an- 
other year or two, party government will have been 
reasonably well established, especially if the power 
of the militarists is broken by the abolition of con- 
scription under a league of nations. Mr. Hara al- 
ready has won part at least of his direct conflicts 
with the clansmen. This is an auspicious augury.

The Peasant as Peacemaker 



.HAT AUGUST DEITY, the future historian, will 
probably not be tempted to devote much attention 
to any part of the Great War except its beginning 
and its end. The war itself will present to him a 
mere blood and thunder drama: only the prologue 
and epilogue will furnish him with materials worthy 
of his muse. He will doubtless endeavor to focus 
his inquiries through the lens of a great dominant 
personality, and the name of Wilhelm III, Lloyd 
George, Count Czernin, or Woodrow Wilson will 
call for his just consideration. But some of these 
international characters enter the war belatedly, and 
others make a hasty exit, midst gallery hoots, before 
the drama is fully enacted. The biography of one 
man alone will enable our historian completely to 
make head and tail out of the entire situation, from 
1871 to 1919. His name is Georges Clemenceau. 

" In France," observe Messrs. Geddes and Bran- 
ford in The Coming Polity, " every man tends 
to be a Parisian or a peasant." It is the peculiar 
merit of Clemenceau that he is something of both, 
and he thus embodies not merely his time but his 
country. In a few salient lines Mr. H. W. Hynd- 
man, the ancient premier's latest biographer, sketches 
the background of his early existence (Clemenceau: 
The Man and His Time; Stokes). Born in Le Ven- 
dee in 1841, the son of a landowner practicing medi- 
cine among the stricken peasants of his neighborhood, 
Clemenceau fell heir at the moment of birth to a 
twofold heritage. The land itself rooted the man to 
its agricultural past, with its unremitting labor, its 
penuries, and its single-minded effort to cultivate the 
earth and cleave to its products. "France means 
rural France." There more than elsewhere in the 
Western World the " country " identifies itself with 
the open country. Throughout his boyhood Clem- 
enceau was thrown among human beings whose sym- 
pathies were stunted and whose actions were 
brutalized " by their ever present greed for gain." 
Higher in pecuniary status, young Clemenceau was 
nevertheless one of them. When half a century 
later his biographer sought to discuss with him the 
progress of socialism, he belittled the importance of 
the movement by calling up to mind the simple land- 
owners and fishermen of his native region and ask- 
ing what chance a proposal for nationalizing land 
would have among these faithful gleaners of the 
earth. So much for his first heritage. 

On the other hand, Clemenceau 's immediate con- 
tacts in his home brought him in touch with the 
superficial culture of his own time, for his father 
was a materialist and a republican, and the career 



of Clemenceau in Paris is that of a radical, an anti- 
clerical, and a builder of the Third Republic. M. 
Georges Lecomte (Clemenceau: The Tiger of 
France; Appleton) has written a panegyric upon 
this second element in Clemenceau's makeup, as a 
representative politician and Parisian, but he tells 
only half the story. In his reverence for the man 
of maturity M. Lecomte overlooks the obdurate and 
indomitable boy, and he accordingly mistakes the 
beauty of the efflorescence for the strength of the 
roots. Yet the further one penetrates the character 
of Clemenceau the more apparent it becomes that 
his first three lustrums in the open country outweigh 
as many generations spent in the city. For beneath 
the various professional guises of medical student, 
philosopher, school teacher, journalist, and adminis- 
trator lie the tenacious jealousies and loyalties of 
the instinctive nationalist, and the nationalism which 
Clemenceau embodies is at bottom simply that of 
the peasant, eager to plant his fields in security of 
harvest, insistent upon respect for his property, re- 
luctant to abandon traditional usages, angry at all 
trespass, and skeptical of any sort of legal relation 
which seems to imply disregard for the fences and 
ditches that encircle his fields. 

The state may indeed be the city writ large, but 
la patrie of the nationalist is the farmstead of a 
family extended to embrace a nation. The state 
is a civil, and the " country " a rural, concept. To 
a peasant the loss of territory means flat disaster: it 
stands for the uprooting of family ties and increased 
difficulties in finding subsistence. Naturally he 
thinks of affairs of state in terms of his own estate. 
Clemenceau's protest against Germany's appropria- 
tion of Alsace-Lorraine was the cry of an outraged 
and unrelenting peasant, and the proof of this is that 
whereas less representative writers and politicians 
tended to let this ancient wrong slide into oblivion 
Clemenceau was ever watchful to keep the memory 
of it alive. Alsace-Lorraine was the King Charles' 
Head which Clemenceau could never keep from 
bobbing up in his speeches and articles. He judged 
every new profession of Germany, he judges even 
those of the democratic regime today, in the light 
of its oldtime practices. Like the Alsatian he men- 
tions in France Facing Germany (Dutton), Clem- 
enceau was " one of those who do not forget." 

During two generations of abated physical hostil- 
ity Clemenceau succeeded, with a vestal patience, in 
keeping the fires of warfare burning. While it 
was Bismarck's policy to promote French imperialism 
in order to take the mind of the defeated nation off

the lost territory in the East f it was Clemenceau's 
cue to combat the far-flung expeditions in Africa 
and Asia lest the old sentiment of humiliation, 
coupled with the hope for revenge and recovery, 
should be buried by new military triumphs. 
Strengthen the core of France; concentrate within; 
develop integrity and firmness; prepare yourselves 
with a three-year military service act for in the end 
we must fight the forces that gather against us be- 
yond the Rhine. Day in and day out this was the 
counsel Clemenceau reiterated, in books, in speeches, 
and in editorials. He began by painting the devil 
on the wall, and by the very act of painting (as a 
disciple of William James will quickly see) created 
the devil which was finally to leap over the wall. 
Every time that Germany .officially offered the hand 
of friendship, the wily old peasant in the Parisian 
shook his head firmly and pointed in contempt to the 
saber that glinted beneath the cloak. While there 
was a chance of victory by crossing rapiers he dog- 
gedly refused to clasp hands. 

"The dead have created the living; the living 
will remain faithful to the dead." On that note 
Clemenceau concluded his famous speech on the 
Moroccan affair in February 1912. Is it necessary 
to point out that the dead whom Clemenceau re- 
membered were those who had fallen in the shame- 
ful debacle of 1870, and that the tradition he 
remained faithful to was that which was regnant 
in the bellicose period of his youth? It was the 
misfortune of the world that the robbery of Alsace- 
Lorraine should ever have been allowed. It was a 
crowning disaster that the Great War should have 
been settled under the auspices of the one man who 
had devoted his life to disallowing this malappro- 
priation, and whose ideas and impulses were directed 
by the precedents established in that early time. In 
solving the problem of Alsace-Lorraine it was only 
natural that the new conqueror should have taken 
the opportunity to create a new "Alsace-Lorraine." 
The present peace of Versailles may indeed gratify 
the lares and penates of ancestral France, but it is 
dedicated to ideals and conditions which have no 
sanction in the worlds of industry, commerce, and 
thought brought into existence by the twentieth 



century. It is a peace faithful to the dead with a 
vengeance. Doubtless the dead are satisfied, for 
Clemenceau, their spokesman and devotee, says that 
the peace which he dictated is " good." Whether 
those who are most concerned with enjoying the 
fruits of the present victory will so regard the anti- 
quated arrangements and guarantees upon which 
Clemenceau has been so insistent cannot immediately 
be answered, for the generation this faithful old 
creature of the jungle failed to pay due attention to 
is that which is yet to be born. 

Understanding is notoriously the basis of forgive- 
ness, and those who read the story of Clemenceau's 
life will not be tempted to judge its wretched con- 
summation too harshly. It is by the law of the 
opening age that he has sinned : in terms of his own 
period and ancestry, in terms of that France which 
was republican during its imperialism, and imperial- 
ist in spite of its republicanism, he stands at the 
pinnacle of success. It is true that he spent his life 
in fostering the processes of traditional animosity. 
But in strengthening France for war he was only 
building logically upon the postulates of statecraft 
which had value and currency in his youth. At 
the critical moment he took up the burdens of state 
when his policies seemed about to collapse in an 
indeterminate (more or less unresentful) peace, and 
he brought the conflict to a "successful conclusion." 
It is enough to judge him in his own words. " A 
wise settlement, which should be hailed with joy by 
all civilized nations, should put an end to these 
alternations of peace and massacre, resulting from 
the victory of one side or the other. But this will 
not be possible until there shall appear a conqueror 
superior to his conquest, a victor who will be a hero 
in moderation " (1912). There spoke the Parisian, 
the representative of the City Luminant. Senility, 
alas! carries men back to their childhood, and at 
the peace of Versailles it was not the man of cul- 
ture and philosophy that presided. Looking over 
the terms of the unrevised treaty one discovers 
plainly the harsh, crabbed hand of the peasant 
covetous, small-visioned, embittered, and perpetu- 
ally distrustful.

THE DIAL

Sunt Rerum Lacrimae 



HEN, a little over a year ago, translations of 
Chinese poetry began to appear over the signature 
of Arthur Waley, the literary supplement of the 
London Times devoted a leader to a panegyric of 
them and, among other things, predicted that the 
whole course of occidental poetry might well and 
for that matter profitably be changed by this spirit- 
ual invasion from the East. The writer in the 
Times was most struck by the total absence, in 
Chinese poetry, of the literary artifices which, for 
the last twenty-five centuries at any rate, have made 
occidental poetry what it is. He was moved, as 
others have been, 'by the bare simplicity of it, its, 
stalwart and rugged adherence to the homelier facts 
and truths, its contemplative naivete, its honesty, 
and its singularly charming blend of the implicit 
and the explicit. These are, indeed, the conclusions 
which one out of ten readers of Mr. Waley 's col- 
lection, One Hundred and Seventy Chinese Lyrics 
(Knopf), might justifiably reach. Mr. Waley has 
employed as his translation-medium, for the most 
part, a free verse in which, despite his preface (he 
appears to consider that he has kept the rhythm of 
the original), there is hardly a trace of any sort of 
rhythm other than that of a well-felt prose. But 
this is a fact which (after a few lines) one has com- 
pletely forgotten; for Mr. Waley has produced a 
book which, strictly regarded as a piece of English 
literature, has a remarkable beauty. As poetry one 
has little but praise for it. It is a clear enough, and 
precious enough, addition to our English gamut. If 
one has any quarrel with it at all, one quarrels with 
it as a translation. 

And here, I believe, there is some ground for 
thinking Mr. Waley 's book misleading. For, as 
noticed above in the case of the writer in the 
London Times, most people will* instantly conclude, 
after reading these deliciously candid and straight- 
forward free-verse poems, that Chinese poetry is a 
far simpler and far less artificial affair than ours; 
and many who already incline towards the less 
formal of poetic methods will employ this as the 
final coup de grace in their argument against an art 
of delicate elaboration. Their argument, of course, 
gains force with the publication of any successful 
book of free verse; but of the historical argument 
which Mr. Waley 's book seems so completely to 
afford them they must be deprived. For Chinese 
poetry is not a poetry even remotely akin to free 
verse; and it is far from being artless. 

As a matter of fact, little as one would gather it 
from Mr. Waley's preface, or from Judith Gau- 



tier's preface to Chinese Lyrics from the Book of 
Jade (Huebsch), or from Mr. Cranmer-Byng's 
preface to A Lute of Jade (Dutton) all of which 
are in almost equal measure informative and con- 
fusing Chinese poetry is perhaps more elaborately 
and studiously artificial (as distinguished from art- 
less) than any other. The literary traditions are 
so powerful and inflexible as to be almost ritual- 
istic. The forms are few and exactly prescribed, 
the rules many. When it is recalled that the Chi- 
nese language is entirely monosyllabic ; that the 
variety of rhymes is small; that all words are, for 
the purposes of poetry, inflected as either flats or 
sharps (the inflection for each word being fixed) ; 
and that Chinese poetry employs not only rhyme, 
and an exact number of syllables in each line, but 
that these syllables must follow a precise pattern in 
accordance with inflection (equivalent, in a degree, 
to our ictus) , one begins to see how complex an art 
it is. A typical four-line stanza, for example, with 
seven words to a line, the cesura falling unalterably 
after the fourth word, and rhyming perhaps a, a, b, 
a, is as follows: 

flat flat sharp 
sharp sharp flat 
flat sharp sharp 
flat flat sharp. 

Almost all Chinese poetry of the great periods is 
stanzaic, and almost all of it is short, the quatrain 
and the poem of eight or twelve lines being the most 
common lengths. A few poets have essayed longer 
poems, some of them narrative notably Po Chii I 
but these are exceptions. 

It is therefore with all these facts in mind that 
one should read the translations of Mr. Waley, or 
Mr. Cranmer-Byng; or Mr. WhitalPs translations 
of the French versions by Judith Gautier. Of the 
three books, Mr. Waley's is distinctly the most com- 
prehensive and from the literary point of view the 
most successful. The other two are usefully sup- 
plementary however, for the reason that the Cran- 
mer-Byng versions are for the most part metrical 
and in rhyme, and serve somewhat to correct one's 
impression that Chinese poetry is non-literary; and 
that the Whitall book consists largely of love 
poems, the element in which the other books are 
weakest. From the three volumes, taken together, 
emerges the fact that Chinese poetry is among the 
most beautiful that man has written. Artificial and 
elaborate it may be as regards the mold into which 
it is cast; but, at any rate as presented to us in 
Arthur Waley's book, it seems, by contrast with

most occidental poetry, poignantly simple and 
human. How much of this we must credit to Mr. 
Waley we cannot, of course, tell. We must remem- 
ber that it is above all else a poet's art which the 
Chinese set store by. A part of the charm of this 
poetry, stripped of its art for us who are occidental, 
must inevitably be simply due to its combination of 
the strange < with the familiar, of the remote with 
the comprehensible. But one is tempted to go 
farther and to say that Chinese poetry seems more 
than any other a cry from the bewildered heart of 
humanity. Sorrow is the most persistent note in 
it sorrow, or sorrowful resignation ; sorrow for the 
inevitable partings of friends, sorrow for the home 
remembered in exile, for the departure of youth, the 
futility of a great career, the injustice of man, the 
loneliness of old age. The Freudians will have 
something to explain in the remarkable infrequency 
with which it deals with love between the sexes; it 
is friendship which is most honored. And perhaps 
one is wrong in saying that these poems, even as 
given in the limpid free verse of Mr. Waley, in 
delicately colloquial prose-rhythms, are altogether 
artless. The rhythm of ideas is clear; and that sort 
of dim counterpoint which may be manifest in the 
thought itself is not less apparent. Simple and 
homely as appear the details by which these poets 
evoke a mood, simple and homely and prosaic as the 
mood itself may appear, it is when one attempts 
retrospectively to reconstruct the steps by which any 
such mood-poem was completed that one perceives 
how exquisitely selective was the poet, with what 
patient fastidiousness he searched for the clear 
qualities of things, and with what a magical pre- 
cision he found just that tone of restraint, almost of 
matter-of-factness, which fairly whizzed with over- 
tones. A popular form of Chinese poetry is the 
four-line poem called the stop-short, in which the 
sense is supposed to continue after the poem has 
stopped. But even in the longer poems that is 
almost universally the method. It is the hum of 
reverberations, after the poem has been read, that 
is sought for. And even such a narrative poem as 



Po Chu I's Everlasting Wrong, one of the famous 
" long " poems of the language (though it runs only 
to a few pages), is constructed in accordance with 
this instinct, and is, therefore, really a sequence of 
lyrics. 

Does all this mean that Chinese poetry is pro- 
foundly unlike our own? Perhaps not, in theory. 
Restraint and understatement have always been 
characteristic of Anglo-Saxon poetry, though not to 
the same extent. It is in the sort of themes chosen 
that one feels the most profound divergence. Our 
own themes are apt to be sublimated and " literary," 
to some degree conventionalized, no matter how 
simple and colloquial may be the treatment. The 
themes of the Chinese poets are highly convention- 
alized the same themes used over and over again 
but they are essentially simple. Sunt rerum lacri- 
mae it is the pathos in things that the Chinese 
poets play upon, century after century; the inani- 
mate things, the things of humble human use, the 
small utilities which we associate with lives simply 
lived, supply the medium through which Li Po or 
Po Chii I or T'ao Ch'ien pierce our hearts. One is 
struck by the childlike candor of this poetry: no 
detail is forbidden as it would be in our poetry, 
perhaps because it seems too prosaic; the sole 
question raised is as to its emotional appropriate- 
ness. Is it a comb, a fan, a torn dress, a curtain, a 
bed, an empty rice-bin? It hardly seems to matter. 
The Chinese poet makes a heart-breaking poetry 
out of these quite as naturally as Keats did out of 
the song of a nightingale heard in a spring garden. 
It is rarely dithyrambic, rarely high-pitched : part 
of its charm is in its tranquillity, its self-control. 
And the humblest reads it with as much emotion 
as the most learned. . . . Was the writer in 
the London Times right, therefore, in thinking that 
this poetry might be a wholesome influence for our 
own ? If it can teach our poets warmth* and human- 
ness qualities in which American poets are singu- 
larly lacking the answer must be an unqualified 

yes< CONRAD AIKEN. 



With a Book of Chinese Lyrics 

In these days of sad optimism and bitter joy, 
When yesterday's hot brand has dropped to ashes 
And the pale new hour is voiceless, 
I am glad that once friends sat in silk 
To sip the jade-clear wine and talk of verses 
While maidens, in the dark pavilion 
Watching the sliding shadow of the moon 
Below the silver ripples, thrilled to hear 
The rustle of an oar among the reeds.

'O 



'PEN COVENANTS OPENLY ARRIVED AT" WES 

the heroic challenge which the President once, in a 
moment of exaltation, threw in' the face of the Elder 
Statesmen. But it is already a matter of common 
notoriety how the President's proud words have 
gone whistling down the winds, while the Elder 
Statesmen have continued to follow their own devi- 
ous devices. With jealous care the conclave of 
Elder Statesmen representing the Great Powers 
have guarded the secrecy of their deliberations while 
they have been arranging the world's peace on the 
good old plan. The Elder Statesmen have been at 
pains to give out no " information which might be 
useful to the enemy " ; that is to say, to the under- 
lying population of these Great Powers. And 
among these Great Powers of the secret conclave 
America is neither last nor least; quite the contrary 
in fact. Nor is information withheld less carefully 
from the underlying population of democratic 
America than from the unfree populace of Europe. 
" Open covenants openly arrived at " has gone into 
abeyance. This outcome of course marks a defeat 
of democratic ideals. That it does so may be fortu- 
nate or otherwise, but the fact of this defeat should 
not be overlooked. The fact is to be taken as mark- 
ing an advance, or at least a conclusive change, in 
the guiding principles of statesmanship. Democratic 
methods are no longer safe if they ever have been. 
They will no longer serve the uses of statesmanship. 
The underlying population is no longer a party in 
interest in national policy or in international nego- 
tiations, in such fashion as would warrant consulting 
their notions of what should be done. Circum- 
stances have taken such a turn that each of these 
civilized nations is now divided within itself, in such 
a way that the national administration now repre- 
sents an oligarchy and speaks for a group of interests* 
rather than for an undivided people at large. This 
follows unavoidably from the existing economic 
order, which is built on a division of interests, be- 
tween the kept classes and the common man. And 
the events of the past few years have forced 
this truth upon the conviction of the statesmen, and 
not least convincingly upon the democratic states- 
man of America. They have been brought to real- 
ize that their avowed ideals of democratic rule and 
popular discussion are hopelessly out of date, that 
the situation which faces them can no longer be 
handled by democratic methods, that an ever-widen- 
ing cleavage of interest has arisen within each of the 
nations between the vested interests and the under- 
lying populaton, and that it is the part of the states- 



man unreservedly to range himself on the side of 
law and order that is to say, on the side of the 
vested interests. This conclusion follows because, 
in the nature of the case, the party of the vested 
interests is always the party of law and order. Law 
and order means that legal order which safeguards 
the established rights of privilege and property. 
Such being the situation, the underlying population 
is plainly not to be trusted with a free run of infor- 
mation on public affairs. In effect, the people at 
large, in these nominally democratic nations, are fall- 
ing into the position of a subject population; some- 
thing in the way of body of alien enemies, to be used, 
humored, and " kept in hand." There is, for in- 
stance, a highy instructive resemblance between the 
American legislation, late and prospective, designed 
for the control of American citizens on the one hand, 
and the notorious Rowlatt Acts by which the 
gentlemanly British administration is endeavoring to 
keep their Indian subjects " in hand." Both the 
Indians and the Americans are to be kept in hand 
for their own good, no doubt, but more immediately 
and more obviously for the good of the vested 
interests of business and office-holding. Therefore, 
placed in this precarious posture, facing a distrustful 
underlying population, it has become the first care 
of these Elder Statesmen in all their deliberations 
to give out no information which might become 
useful to the enemy. This strategic secrecy of peace- 
making conclave is presumptive evidence that in the 
apprehension to these Elder Statesmen the interests 
which have been guiding their deliberations do not 
at any substantial point coincide with those interests 
which the underlying population have at heart. The 
underlying population want peace and industry; the 
Elder Statesmen have negotiated an arrangement for 
safeguarding the vested interests of privilege and 
property by force of arms. These two lines of inter- 
ests are out of touch ; and they may prove to be in- 
compatible. So the shrewd Elder Statesmen have 
consumed half a year in carrying out a strategic dis- 
position of their forces under cover of night and 
cloud, with a view to safeguarding the status quo; 
and so the underlying populations now face a state 
of fait accompli, whereby the resources of these 
several nations are already committed to an 
international enterprise in defense of the vested 
interests, all and several, at the cost of under- 
lying populations. Behind the smoke-screen of 
the seven censors and the Associated Prevarication 
bureaus, that much is visible now. But the ques- 
tion remains, Why has that high-hearted crusade 



26 



July 12 



which set out to make the world safe for democracy 
by open covenant openly arrived at come to this 
inglorious end behind the smoke-screen? The 
answer appears to be covered by this golden text: 
Bolshevism is a menace to the vested interests of 
privilege and property. There need be no question 
as to the utter good faith of that crusade for democ- 
racy and open covenants; no more than there is a 
question as to its utter defeat. Nor need there be 
a question as to the paramount responsibility of 
America's spokesman for this outcome of the peace- 
making conclave. No single one of the powers and 
no coalition of powers has been in a position to make 
a substantial move at any point in these negotiations 
without the paramount consent and advice of 
America's spokesman. Without America's backing 
the " high contracting parties " are practically 
bankrupt, all and several ; and apart from America's 
spokesman no two of them could reasonably trust 
one another out of sight. So that what this con- 
clave of Elder Statesmen has achieved and what it 
has committed itself to is, in effect, his achievement 
and 'his commitment. 



/AMERICA'S SPOKESMEN SET OUT WITH A HIGH 
and well-advised resolve to make the world safe for 
democracy; but it was to be a democracy founded 
in commercialized nationalism, after the pattern of 
mid- Victorian times, which being interpreted means 
a democracy for safeguarding the vested interests of 
property. Now between the date of the President's 
high pronouncement on open covenants and safe 
democracy and the date of the peacemaking conclave 
there intervenes the unlooked for episode of Soviet 
Russia, the substantial core of whose policy is the 
disallowance of these same vested interests of prop- 
erty which make up the substantial core of that 
mid-Victorian commercialized democracy that was 
to be saved. It is easily to be seen that the Bol- 
shevism of Soviet Russia is a menace ^o that com- 
mercialized democracy which mid-Victorian states- 
men are concerned to perpetuate. Indeed, it is 
easily to be seen that the material interests of the 
underlying population in the other nations would 
incline them to fall in with its policy of disallow- 
ance, just so soon as these underlying populations 
come to realize that they have nothing to lose, 
which is believed to argue no distant date. At least 
such appears to be the universal conviction among 
those statesmen who speak for the maintenance of 
law and order. The situation therefore calls for 
heroic remedies. The safety of those vested 
interests of property that now make up the substance 
of things hoped for could not be jeopardized to make 
the world safe for a democracy devoid of vested 
interests. Bolshevism is a menace to these vested 
interests, and to any mid-Victorian statesman it is 
a truism that these interests must and shall be pre- 
served from this menace at any cost the cost to be 
paid by the underlying population. This cost at 
which the menace of Bolshevism is to be averted 



involves more or less costly and undesirable working 
arrangements with all the forces of reaction, since 
none but the forces of reaction can be counted on 
to take the field openly in the prosecution of such 
an enterprise. And arrangements of this kind for 
the support and subsidy of reactionary enterprise, 
responsible and irresponsible in effect, for the sup- 
port of any enterprise sufficiently reactionary to take 
the field cannot be openly arrived at by spokesmen 
of any democratic commonwealth. Hence the secret 
conclave and the smoke-screen of the seven censors. 
It is a sufficiently difficult passage, not to say a 
desperate quandary. However, it appears that under 
cover of night and cloud arrangements of this kind 
have been reached which it is hopefully believed 
will be sufficient; arrangements for the comfort and 
success of reactionary enterprise in Finland, Livonia, 
Esthonia, Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Roumania, and 
the reactionary factions in Russia, north, south, and 
east. It is an unfortunate circumstance that all this 
making of terms with the forces of reaction for the 
safeguarding of the vested interests will not bear 
the light. It is unfortunate, but there is no 'help 
for it. Needs must when the devil drives, and 
Bolshevism is largely believed to be that breed. So 
it is devoutly to be hoped that these transactions that 
will not bear the light, these enforced but distaste- 
ful concessions of the democratic statesmen to the 
more shameless powers of reaction, will duly bring 
in that good fruit of domestic tranquillity which is 
bargained for at such a price and all beneath the 
spreading chestnut tree of commercialized national- 
ism. Quod bonum, felix faustumque sit! 



1 HE SENATE MAY REVISE THE PRESENT TREATY 

and covenant. But the Senate cannot by a stroke of 
the pen alter the sort of world in which these instru- 
ments, revised or unrevised, will have to function. 
The signing of the Treaty gives us the first oppor- 
tunity to look beyond the Treaty. Making such a 
survey, Mr. Bertrand Russell pointed out in THE 
DIAL for June 28 that labor elements in Europe 
will find their approaching political dominance in- 
secure as long as the United States is ready to main- 
tain a protectorate over vested interests and vested 
privileges at home and abroad. On the surface there 
are no political or economic groups here prepared 
to take up the challenge that Mr. Russell thus 
throws down. Morally, the United States is no 
longer the hope of the world. On the contrary, 
America's effort to stabilize capitalism at the ex- 
pense of social reconstruction is the outstanding 
feature of the Government's international polity. 
The great body of citizens is probably reactionary 
only out of apathy, but the groups which are effec- 
tively organized the politicians, the labor union- 
ists, and the financiers have formed a Triple 
Alliance in the interest of active reaction. At home, 
accordingly, the outlook for labor is dismal, but a 
survey of the world at large offers a gleam of 
hope. We cannot effect the increase in pro- 



1919

duction called for by the financiers as long as 
industrial enterprise is handicapped by all the stop- 
pages, slackenings, and internecine struggles for 
pecuniary advantage that characterized it before 
the war. Indeed, industry will have to enlist the 
energies of its workers more completely than it was 
able to even during the crisis of the late conflict. 
This means that there must be a thoroughgoing re- 
construction at every point in the industrial pro- 
cess. It requires the participation of the workers 
in the management, and the transfer of authority 
from the pecuniary strategists of the antiquated 
financial regime to the now subordinate controllers 
of material and personnel. In other words, the sit- 
uation that gives capitalism the promise of renewed 
life makes this offer on the condition that it will be 
transformed out of all recognition. The hope of 
reconstruction today, therefore, lies not in the lib- 
eralism of America but in the needs of an impover- 
ished and prostrated mankind. 

PERHAPS THE LABOR MOVEMENT ABROAD is NOT 
so desperately menaced by the rear attack of Amer- 
ican reaction as Mr. Russell believes. The proposal 
adopted by British, French, and Italian trades-union- 
ists to make a demonstration against military inter- 
vention in Russia gives reassuring evidence that the 
plans of British imperialism and American capital- 
ism cannot be pushed through to a conclusion. It 
seems equally true that the chances of a helpful 
reconstitution of America's political and economic 
structure will depend upon the ability of the labor 
elements, particularly in England and France, to 
take charge of the ship of state, man the quarter- 
deck with able officers, and chart a new course. 
What strengthens the hand of labor nationally will 
in the long run strengthen it internationally. The 
more powerful labor's Triple Alliance is in Great 
Britain, the weaker will be reaction's Triple Alli- 
ance in America. It is the old world that holds 
forth the promise of the new. 



1 HE RECENT RAIDS MADE BY THE LUSK COM- 

mittee, of the New York State Legislature, on the 
Russian Soviet Bureau, the Rand School, The Com- 
munist newspaper, an I. W. W. and an S. P. lecai 
is the distinguished contribution of the Empire state 
to the national job of clearing the country of radical 
opinion and making freedom safe for a few. These 
raids, the deportation and imprisonment of law- 
abiding labor leaders are an embarrassment to fair 
and liberal-minded citizens who condemn high- 
handed feats of frontier justice as un-American. 
We wonder whether or not they are. As the wtyite 
man of the South is out to lynch " the nigger," and 
a Citizen Alliance of the West lines up to tar and 
feather " the wobbly," so the state and federal legis- 
lators and officials pursue " the bolsheviki." The 
fact that the latter are pursued by government agents 
does not affect the animus of the pursuit nor dif- 



ferentiate it in character. Government agents are 
as averse as are the hoodlums to a consideration of 
the actual evidence at hand. If a white woman 
points an accusing finger at a black man, that settles 
the matter; he is hung. If the Lusk Committee, 
after discarding the great mass of letters and other 
documents which explain that the purpose of the So- 
viet Bureau in America is to carry on trade in the 
accustomed way, can find a sentence which is sus- 
ceptible to the interpretation which the Committee 
is after, that discovery settles the matter for the 
press of the country as well as the Committee. In 
going through the papers of the Rand School this 
State Committee discovers that the Socialist Party 
has been carrying on socialist propaganda among 
the negroes of the South. Although this activity 
of the Socialists has been a public matter for many 
years and although it has never before occurred to 
the state of New York that it had any concern 
in the matter, this discovery and others of the 
same nature in the opinion of the Committee war- 
rants the closing of the School. There can be no 
doubt about it; America revels in direct action. 
The objection to the action of the agencies we have 
been speaking of is that it is raw. It is elemental in 
that it is swayed by suggestion. It is uninhibited 
by an infiltration of reason. As it reflects the 
egoistic conception of existence, it is opposed to a 
state of civilization where the freedom of indi- 
viduals is dependent not on the sacrifice of others 
but on an experience which is expansive because it 
is common. What is familiarly known as direct 
action is advocated by some but not all of the 
defendants now before the Lusk Committee; but 
it is action of quite another sort. The intention 
is to get what is wanted in each case by the 
most direct road. But where direct action has been 
adopted by labor as a policy, it is not instinctive. 
It has come out of a long experience of trial and 
error. It represents defeated efforts to adjust rela- 
tions by prescribed rules. The direct action of 
labor has come through the refining experience of 
a failure which has been checked up by reason and 
a highly sensitized consciousness of social needs. 
Like the black man in the South every one is suspect 
(that is, he is Bolshevik) who has come through 
this experience first-hand, or who has emotions 
sufficiently cultured by concepts to value the economy 
which yields, in the large, human results. It ap- 
pears in Europe at the present moment that such 
people may shortly if not already represent the 
majority. The working people of Europe have been 
checking up their experience for a long time. It 
is because the American worker has failed to do this 
that he is caught by the American Federation of 
Labor machine, the Lusk Committee, and all the

Casual Comment 

NOT THE LEAST LAMENTABLE FEATURE OF THE 

war has been the failure of the writers to give us a 
realizing sense of what has been taking place. It is 
now habitual with us to excuse the pitiful inade- 
quacy of war literature on the ground that this war 
has been too vast for any contemporary reporting, 
the assumption being that any worth-while report 
must needs embrace the whole panorama of the 
fighting. The assumption is unsound: 'the most ex- 
acting among us have required of the reporter only 
a clear communication of the reality that happened 
to fall under his own observation. The clear com- 
munication of any reality is a difficult business, of 
course difficult but not impossible, or there would 
be no good literature of any kind. That the war was 
not impossible to report in this way has been demon- 
strated by the dispatches of Philip Gibbs, the stories 
of Barbusse and Latzko, the poems of Sassoon and 
Aldington, and the letters and reminiscences of a 
very few others. But in all the avalanches of war 
books that have swept over us since 1914 there has 
been singularly little that seems likely to endure. 
The inadequacy of the war books, however, has been 
as nothing to the inadequacy of their illustrations 
and of war pictures in general. Except for the 
paintings of one or two "official" artists like Nevin- 
son and Johns, the cartoons of Bairnsfather, the etch- 
ings of Pennell, and an occasional happy photograph 
(usually of a ruin), our notions of what the front 
looked like were derived from recruiting posters done 
by men who had never seen it or from accidents of 
apt description in the books. Almost none of these 
books had the assistance of telling pictures, and those 
that did were not so distinguished in any other way 
as to attract much attention. James McBey, "Offi- 
cial Artist with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force," 
made a series of atmospheric drawings for the Desert 
Campaigns (Putnam), whose text by W. T. Mas- 
sey, "Official Correspondent of London Newspapers 
with," etc. failed to support them. There was 
closer cooperation between Charles Huard and 
Frances Wilson Huard in her With Those Who 
Wait (Doran), but his fetching drawings were 
mostly devoted to old-world corners far behind the 
lines. Not unnaturally, however, the imagination of 
the illustrators who dealt with the front was most 
vitally kindled by the air service. For instance, 
when the authorized translation of Henry Bor- 
deaux's Georges Guynemer: Knight of the Air ap- 
peared in this country it included four charcoal 
drawings by W. A. Dwiggins, of which three were 
very close to perfection in their magical evocation of 
certain quiet moments in the air. (For some reason 
or other the Yale University Press featured an im- 
possible frontispiece by another hand and let Mr. 
Dwiggins name appear only in the list of illustra- 
tions.) And now come Lieutenant Henry Farre's 
almost as successful, if somewhat theatrical, paint- 
ings of a number of very active moments in the air, 



illustrated by rather than illustrating his own text 
in Sky Fighters of France (Houghton-Mifflin). 
Among all the books about flying it is odd that there 
should be only two or three to offer worth-while 
pictures of an occupation so new and so fascinating. 
And yet if the other military departments had been 
even as well served as this, we should now have a 
shelf of volumes whose illustrations might in a meas- 
ure fill the blanks left by the writers. 

1 HE PULITZER PRIZE OF $500 FOR THE BEST 
volume of verse published by an American in 
1918 has been divided between Margaret Widde- 
mer's The Old Road to Paradise and Carl Sand- 
burg's Cornhuskers (both from Holt) a unique 
bracketing if ever there was one. The judges were 
William Lyon Phelps, Richard Burton, and Sara 
Teasdale. The Widdemer collection is that of a 
really popular singer, an<J in it are poems reprinted 
from as motley a list of magazines ranging widely 
between the Youth's Companion and Poetry as any 
1918 volume of American poetry could possibly boast. 
In this book Miss Widdemer sets out for no new goal 
and scales no peaks in Darien. She does not hold us 
quite so firmly as in some of her previous work as 
notably in her poems on labor conditions and the 
judges must have had an unusually keen sympathy 
with her moods in order to certify this book as one 
of the best volumes of verse published in 1918. 
Many of the poems are fetching, and as a whole 
they cover a wide field, but the chief merit of the 
book lies in deftly expressed individual ideas. As for 
Cornhuskers, which* Louis Untermeyer reviewed 
in THE DIAL for October 5, 1918 (Strong 
Timber) it is equally a book of deftly put ideas. 
But in nothing else does it resemble Miss Widde- 
mer's work. It is a book of free verse, a book of 
the poetical revolution. And much of it is that 
and no more. It is significant that such a book can 
. receive so much as half a prize from Columbia 
University and no less significant that the compen- 
sating half can find nothing more powerful than 
the Old Road to Paradise to distinguish.

of those delusions that could be explained out of 
existence." We read it somewhere in a bit of 
literary criticism and we doubt it. The doubt 
takes us back to a specific moment in a confessedly 
important year, when a great number of men were 
being moved across a great ocean, in the face of 
difficulties. . . . The time is early twilight. 
The brown walls of a ship's cabin enclose the scene, 
except where open ports and doors reveal areas of 
the Southern Ocean banded brown and blue, shaken 
slowly and smoothly like velvet curtains in a breath 
of wind. Through the wide sweep of the doorway 
six or eight oddly mottled ships are seen falling 
away in decreasing perspective to the horizon. At a 
table in the room is seated a man in the uniform of

an officer of the United States Army. Before him 
are piled letters hundreds of them. He is reading 
them rapidly, for daylight is failing and in the sub- 
marine zone ships are black at night. Look over his 
shoulder: "Dearest Alice" this one begins. It is 
written with the stub of a pencil, and one word in 
four is misspelled, but the ideals are of early Vic- 
torian love-in-a-cottage after the war. " My dear 
Miss Johnson " this one is formal, heart-broken 
over a cold farewell, yet half hopeful that circum- 
stances will play fair. " My own Ruth " an- 
other beginning so, ends thus, in romance: " In the 
evening after you have read this, go down to the 
honeysuckle arbor by the side gate. Lift up the 
board of the seat there is a little package in there 
for you. I put it there the last night I had a pass 
to go and see you. I wanted to give it to you, but 
I just couldn't come up to it. It will be months 
before I can get your answer, but I am going to 
write every day just as though I knew you had put 
the ring on for me. I have got to believe it. And 
when I come back, we. . . ." " O.K." wrote 
the uniformed censor, and signed his name. Then 
he rose and stretched himself. Somehow there 
seemed an odor of honeysuckle in the room. 

FROM CHINA COMES NOW A NEW MAGAZINE, FIRST 
issued in March, and bravely edited by Mr. Samuel 
Couling, at Medhurst College, Shanghai. We say 
"bravely" with due consideration, for the New China 
Review was conceived during the war, and it had 
to fight against the stars of indifference, defective 
communication, and want of interest that struggled 
against it at birth. It is an attempt to take up a 
field The Chinese Repository abandoned in 1901 
and left in the hands of French scholars. The ap- 
pearance of Professor Giles' name in the first issue 
is assurance of the ability of the Review to live up to 
its promise to maintain a high standard of scholar- 
ship but at the same time to print contents so varied 
that others than professed sinologues can find pleas- 
ure in them. . . . From New York issues an 
announcement not of a new magazine, but of a 
new name for an old one. The Unpopular Re- 
view (Holt) is to sail under the title of the Un- 
partizan Review, but the present owners and cap- 
tain will not be changed, and the same academic 
crew will doubtless occupy the forecastle. The 
avidity with which the Unpopular Review was 
seized upon by those who accepted the unpopularity 
of their conservatism as their chief claim to dis- 
tinction made it impossible for the review to live 
up to its older name. Unfortunately there seems little 
prospect that it will come any closer to fulfilling 
the demands of its new title. Unpartizan means, 
we believe, unwilling to take sides, but in connec- 
tion with this otherwise excellent review it means 
merely the unwillingness to throw its weight upon 
the liberal side. At its best it is a promise to call 
a plague upon both radical and conservative houses. 



WHEN A NEW ART HAS COMPLETELY OUTGROWN 
criticism, the critics' job of catching up is com- 
parable to that of pruning a jungle. Thankless and 
hopeless as it may be to begin at this late date to 
frame special standards for the movies, it does seem 
that the producers and the public generally might 
be willing to apply here certain old axioms devel- 
oped in other fields. The first of these axioms is 
perhaps this: that sincerity is a virtue. By reason 
of the vastness of his chosen audience the movie 
producer can deal only in motives that most men 
have in common. The theme that makes the widest 
human appeal is that of sex relationship particu- 
larly if this relationship happens to be somewhat 
risque. The variations that may be played upon 
this theme are, in America, very definitely limited 
by the tradition that sex may appear in public only 
when garbed with respectability. Nowhere does 
this tradition have such force as in the middle-class 
conscience, still powerful in the cities, and domi- 
nant in the small towns that have the movies for 
their only amusement. The man who stages plays 
for a limited audience may choose between the in- 
decency of burlesque and the frankness of Ibsen; 
not so the movie man, whose films are destined to 
flicker before all eyes. Sex he must have to get great 
audiences respectability, to keep them. To meet 
the situation, there has been developed a hypocrisy 
without parallel in art. People who would not 
think of countenancing a frankly vulgar musical 
show may see in the movies pictures of surprising 
indecency spiced with moral phrases and grouped 
under some such allegorical title as Purity or Virtue; 
or triangle plays that inevitably wind up with what 
passes for a great moral triumph for the innocent 
party, who wishes the dark pair all (of their sort of) 
happiness. Whoever will face the situation frankly 
will confess that we have far less to fear from 
honest nastiness than from this kind of lip-licking 
sophistry. Certainly the movies will receive more 
consideration as an art when the movie people ac- 
cept variety in their audiences and do not attempt, 
by blending goodness and badness, to appeal all at 
once to everybody in the United States.

FOOTNOTES WANTED. 

SIR: "If," writes Mrs. Mary Austin, "Mr. 
Untermeyer could get his mind off the Indian An- 
thology as a thing of type and paper, he might have 
got something more out of it." Unfortunately, The 
Path on the Rainbow [Boni & Liveright] came to 
me as a book, composed almost exclusively of type 
and paper. And, as a book, it seemed to be a col- 
lection of indubitable ethnic value, arbitrarily 
printed, and, lacking all but the most rudimentary 
footnotes, by turns careless and cryptic. Mrs. Aus- 
tin's agreement as to the necessity for fuller ex- 
planatory notes proves the very thing that I was try- 
ing, in a rather dogmatic manner, to express: that, 
without the accompanying melodies, blend of voices, 
tympanic beat, these written songs needed much more 
than " paper, type," and a crude reduction to thin 
Imagist verse form. 

Says Mrs. Austin : " Ten thousand American 
boys in a foreign land singing Home Sweet Home is 
a very moving thing, and twice ten Indians at the 
ragged end of Winter, when the food goes stale and 
their very garments smell of wood smoke, singing 
their maple sugar song might sing a great deal of 
poetry into it poetry of rising sap, clean snow 
water, calling partridge, and die friendly click of 
brass bowls and birch-bark sap buckets." . . . This, 
I submit, is the sort of interpretive note that would 
have made valuable much that at present is inconse- 
quential for example, the " maple sugar song " 
which, in its entirety, stands thus in The Path on the 
Rainbow : 

Maple sugar 

is the only thing 
that satisfies me. 

And, I should like to add by way of discourteous 
conclusion, a whole volume of footnotes would not 
have explained the inclusion of Carl Sandburg's 
" translation " of a non-existent Indian croon, the 
sentimental jingling of Miss Johnson's The Lost 
Lagoon, and the too frequent attempts to make an 
obvious primitive emotion look like a piece of preci-

SUICIDAL SABOTAGE 

SIR : Mr. Veblen's article on Sabotage in a recent 
DIAL is the clearest and most complete arti- 
cle I have ever read on this subject, and I have ar- 
rived at the following conclusions : That production 
and distribution are regulated by price. Prices 
curtail the demand. If production is not curtailed 
and prices are lowered to relieve the market and 
meet the demand, dividends will be lowered to a de- 
gree that will make it too unprofitable, if not im- 
possible, for the capitalist to remain in business. 

On the other hand, if production continues to be 



curtailed so that prices can be kept high enough to 
guarantee the necessary margin of profit, an over- 
whelming discontent, unemployment, and extreme 
poverty for the masses will follow ; and they are not 
going to starve. If machine guns are used to stop 
the discontent by wiping out the unemployed and the 
poverty-stricken, the population will be reduced tem- 
porarily and the problem would seem to be solved. 
However, with prices continuing high and the popu- 
lation again on the increase, those remaining would 
not have the money to meet the high prices and divi- 
dends would again be in danger. Production would 
therefore have to be further curtailed, and more un- 
employed and poverty-stricken killed off. This pro- 
cess would have to go on indefinitely until there 
would be no people left except the capitalists and 
their satellites. 

The first method spells disaster for the capitalist, 
and the second means the same for both the capital- 
ists and the masses. What is the solution?

THE VOICE OF JAPANESE DEMOCRACY. By 
Ozaki Yukio. 108 pages. Kelly & Walsh; 
Shanghai. 

To no single person more than to Mr. Ozaki 
Yukio (born in 1859 and early educated in Eng- 
lish, and a visitor to the United States) is the tri- 
umph of essential democracy, as described in this 
issue of THE DIAL, due. His book, issued in mid- 
July of last year, is an eloquent and forcible appeal 
for party government. With the skill of a veteran, 
this most fluent orator in the Diet, ex-minister of 
justice and ex-mayor of Tokio, wields the double- 
edged blade of invincible argument. He points to 
Great Britain as possessing the most stable govern- 
ment because of party government and he 
clinches every argument with a quotation from 
Japan's greatest emperor, whose life spanned the 
era of re-creation, from 1852 to 1912. As to its 
English dress, we feel quite sure that very few, if 
any, foreigners now living could excel the trans- 
lator, an international lawyer, J. E. de Becker, 
D.C.L. The method of reasoning is 'as worthy of 
study by an American reader as are the history and 
arguments here accurately and cogently presented. 
Mrs. Ozaki, the author's wife, is known to 
Americans as a poet and writer of charming folk- 
lore. 

KOREAN TREATIES. Compiled by Henry 
Chung. 226 pages. Nichols. 

Mr. Chung has erected a monument to the mem- 
ory of the independence of his country. Beginning 
with the treaties of friendship, commerce, and 
navigation signed between Korea and the nations 
of Europe and America, he closes with the treaties 
with Japan, which sound the fatal going, going, 
gone. First there is the instrument of February 
1904; in Article III of this treaty Japan agreed 
to " definitively guarantee the independence and 
territorial integrity of the Korean Empire." Next 
there is the compact of August 22, 1904, by which 
the Korean Government was required to engage 
financial and diplomatic advisers recommended by 
Japan. Then there is the agreement of April I, 
1905, by which the system of communications of 
Korea was united with that of Japan; then the 
treaty of November 17, 1905, by which the for- 
eign affairs of Korea were transferred to Japan; 
then that of July 24, 1907, giving over the internal 
administration of Korea to Japan; and finally the 
treaty of annexation of August 29, 1910. A more 
complete record of international bad faith could not 
be made. We learn from the treaty between the 
United States and Korea of May 22, 1882 that these 
countries mutually pledged themselves as follows: 
" If other Powers deal unjustly or oppressively with 
either Government, the other will exert their good 
offices, on being informed of the case, to bring about 



an amicable arrangement." As witness to the honor 
of the United States, Mr. Chung is himself detained 
in this country by desire of the Japanese Govern- 
ment in order that he may not disturb the har- 
mony of the Peace Conference at Paris by rais- 
ing the question of the self-determination oi 
Korea. 



PEKING DUST. By Ellen N. La Motte. 240 
pages. Century. 

Miss La Motte writes in a natural and pic- 
turesque style, has courage good to see these days, 
and tells the truth as to doings in China pleasing 
to read but unpleasant for those who are criticized. 
The author abhors cant. She detects the hollow 
professions of those who cry for democracy in Eu- 
rope and practice high-handedness in China. She 
dares point the finger of scorn at the French, who 
in Tientsin upset decency and fair play by the oc- 
cupation of Lao-Hsi-Kai, adjoining the " French 
Concessions." She heaps wrath on the British for 
inducing the Vice-President of China to purchase 
the opium left on their hands. She points out how 
China got into the war to uphold " the sanctity of 
international law " a " flimsy pretext " but she 
fails to state the part played here by the American 
Legation, probably because she depended somewhat 
on the good graces and kind favor of the American 
Minister. As to Japan she says : " the loudest out- 
cries against Japanese encroachments come from 
those nations that possess the widest spheres of in- 
fluence " Britain and Russia. The author relieves 
the heaviness of political discussion by many spicy 
chapters, written in the form of letters, on all kinds 
of little topics such as " Donkeys Generally," 
" Chinese Houses," " A Dust-Storm," " A Bowl oi 
Porridge." Miss La Motte views things with a 
conscience:- "The world contains a double stand- 
ard of international justice, for the East and the 
West." She thinks that China will yield, not to 
Japanese domination, but to " European aggression 
or ' civilization.' " 

ESSAYS IN SCIENTIFIC SYNTHESIS. By

This work exemplifies one of the most enviable 
phenomena of continental European culture the 
versatility of intellectual interest. The encyclo- 
pedic knowledge that amazes us in a man like 
Wundt represents an extreme individual variation 
but in the direction of a quite general tendency. On 
a somewhat lower plane we find Kropotkin wrest- 
ling with geographical, biological, sociological prob- 
lems, including technical questions of agricultural 
procedure. And so down through the professional 
classes without creative aspirations to the Social- 
istically educated laborer, who is likely to know

our average college graduate. In the present vol- 
ume Signer Rignano, the editor of Scientia, proves 
himself ideally fitted for his task as manager of an 
intellectual clearing-house. Without exhibiting any 
striking originality, he has precisely those mental 
traits required for the organizer of a far-reaching 
intellectual cooperative scheme wide and thorough 
knowledge, sound judgment, an'd clarity of exposi- 
tion. His initial essay on The Role of the Theorist 
in the sciences of Biology and Sociology is admirably 
to the point in explaining the pitfalls of restricted 
specialist study. He rightly argues that the despised 
theorist, being less likely to fall prey to professional 
bias, may be capable of judging the most general 
problems of science with greater sanity. The re- 
mainder of Rignano's book is devoted to a demon- 
stration of his contention with reference to a number 
of basic questions. The chapters on What Is 
Consciousness?, The Religious Phenomenon, and 
Historic Materialism may be mentioned as especially 
attractive. Altogether the volume may be recom- 
mended for the consideration of all seriously inclined 
readers. 

RACIAL FACTORS IN DEMOCRACY. By Philip 
Ainsworth Means. 278 pages. Marshall 
Jones; Boston. 

This is a well-intentioned but rather immature 
attempt to apply anthropological principles to the 
disentanglement of latter-day perplexities. Mr. 
Means has succeeded in casting off the shackles of 
racial snobbishness and his plea for what he calls 
" race-appreciation " merits serious consideration in 
this age of shopworn Chamberlainisms. It has, 
moreover, the support of the sanest scientific opin- 
ion. Where Mr. Means fails is not in his attitude 
towards alien cultures, but in his position towards 
his own. Here he is still very far from having at- 
tained the objectivity of the dispassionate student. 
His comments on democracy and Bolshevism are 
merely facile re-echoings of the growls of the reac- 
tionary press. Why not rather approach these topics 
in the disinterested spirit with which he regards the 
architecture of aboriginal Central America and 
Peru with eagerness to discern new values,- clothed 
though they be in unfamiliar forms? The book 
bristles with references, which jointly form a very 
useful bibliography of anthropological literature. 

GREEN VALLEY. By Katherine Reynolds. 
287 pages. Little, Brown. 

To any one who has lived in a Middle Western 
village this appreciative romance will be most wel- 
come. There is the shoemaker's shop, the post- 
office, the hardware store; there are one or two 
mansions, and scores of cottages, with tiger lilies in 
the front yard and a whiff of cinnamon buns around 
by the back door; and they are all bound together 
by long association and the rapid tongue of friendly 



gossip. Unfortunately the story has a blindly op- 
timistic coloring; affairs are settled in the right way 
by a gifted tactician or two, always at hand. But 
this tone is probably explained by the fact that the 
book was written merely as a diversion, to make the 
thousands of miles between the heart of South 
America and Green Valley seem shorter to a home- 
sick mid-Westerner. The plot is a simple one; 
everything comes out' right, as you know it will. 
The characters are almost too good to be true; they 
stand on the opposite end of the seesaw from the 
Spoon Riverites. The flavor is "folksy", and 
crisp, like that of an old-fashioned caraway cookie. 

EXPERIMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL ADMINIS- 
TRATION. By Francis .Bowes Sayre. 201 
pages. Harper. 

No one can tell what sort of a League of Na- 
tions will emerge from present attempts; no one 
can tell whether it will succeed or fail; but some 
information as to its possibilities, and some hope for 
its ultimate successs, can be found in Mr. Sayre 's 
book. Two sorts of international organizations are 
discussed: those in which the primary purpose is the 
maintenance of peace, and those in which some de- 
tails of governmental administration are put into 
the hands of an international group. The second 
type of organization has several successes to its 
credit; especially when the national sovereignties 
affected have seen fit to give sufficient power to the 
organization, and have assembled the elements oi the 
organization with some thought for the actual needs 
of the situation. Sovereignties have developed 
these international organs of administration only 
under force of necessity, and the point of develop- 
ment reached by any one of them has been directly 
proportional to the degree of necessity in a par- 
ticular situation. Consequently, the conclusion 
seems to be that in spite of the invariable failure of 
the international leagues to maintain peace, this type 
of organization must eventually succeed, because of 
the absolute necessity for its success. The League 
of Nations will become an actuality then because of 
necessity but will it succeed? It wrtl fail in 
the same way that the past experiments have failed, 
if like those experiments it is based upon injustice. 
Of course, the justice of the terms on which the 
League is formed is also to be interpreted in the 
light of necessity. It is safe to say that the justice 
of the arrangements will vary directly with the 
necessities of the situation. What kind of justice or 
injustice is meant? If the justice is to be measured 
by the necessities for maintaining peace, should it 
not be called expediency instead of justice? And 
expediency for whom becomes an additional ques- 
tion. It is no part of the essay to answer these 
questions, or many similar ones. Mr. Sayre merely 
states what has been done, (it must be said that his 
statement is complete enough for general purpose), 
and the reader may draw conclusions as he will.

Readers who like to drop out of the cur-

tures of the 1 7th century. The celebrated 
figures stand out boldly; distinct in their

wit. Mr. Chapman has selected only the 
choicest portions and the whole gives a true 
picture of Johnson's character and of the

THE LAND AND THE SOLDIER. By Frederic 

C. Howe. 196 pages. Scribner. 

FROM WAR TO PEACE. By Herbert Quick. 

278 pages. Bobbs-Merrill. 

If the present administration has any reconstruc- 
tion policy one must look for it in the two books 
which Messrs. Howe and Quick have prepared un- 
der the pressure of the national emergency. Both 
men have been members of the executive ; they have 
been in sympathy with the president; they are ac- 
quainted with official Washington ; and they survey 
the economic situation through the earnest spectacles 
of Henry George. It follows that their plans for 
reconstruction are limited to but one aspect of the 
economic problem : that which concerns the exploita- 
tion of land. And since the problems of industrial 
organization can by no sleight of hand be reduced 
to this single basis, the authors have severally kept 
to a discussion of the rural aspect of reconstruction. 
Within their limits (and the field is no small one) 
there is a touch of freshness in these surveys of the 
land problem. As good single taxers the authors 
are canny enough to perceive that the old-fashioned 
cry of " no land," and the old-fashionad remedy of 
" open up the idle waste land," simply hide the fact 
that good land remains idle because of its unsocial 
appropriation for purposes of speculative monopoly. 
Reclaiming marshes, cut-over areas, and dry lands 
is an expensive substitute for a sound economic pol- 
icy of land distribution ; and both authors are agreed 
to accept and work for none but the honest social 
policy of opening up for development those excel- 
lent farm lands which now repose unused, or but 
partially exploited, in the hands of country gentle- 
men, real estate speculators, golf clubs, and im- 
poverished tenant farmers. A good deal of this 
most valuable unused land lies in the vicinity of our 
great cities (see for example the federal soil survey 
of the western Long Island area) and the policy 
of using it links up with another opinion which 
Messrs. Howe and Quick hold in common. They 
believe that land settlements, whether of foreign im- 
migrants or of returned soldiers, should not be made 
by single-handed individuals after the pioneer fashion 
but by communities, on the plan developed in the 
Australia and California enterprises. They offer 
this community policy on economic grounds, touch- 
ing the cheapness of raw materials in bulk and the 
possibilities of large scale mechanical organization 
in preparing and cultivating the ground; and they 
substantiate it by showing the need in rural life for 
urban elements in education, recreation, and political 
intercourse in order to attract and tq hold the city- 
bent settler. It is not a rural community, but a 
" rurban " community, to use a term coined by the 
Wisconsin School, that these reformer's would de- 
velop by a socially directed land policy. Readers 
who wish to see what can be said in enlightened op- 
position to these plans by an apostle of a refurbished 
individualism should consult the numerous works of 
Mr. Liberty Hyde Bailey. 



THE WAY TO VICTORY. By Philip Gibbs. 2 
vols., 676 pages. Doran. 

If Philip Gibbs were dead The Way to Victory 
would be his monument. Were The Menace and 
The Repulse, the two final volumes of Gibbs' war 
despatches, not so sure of the active interest rather 
than the negligent admiration of posterity, one might 
be tempted to call them classics. Even the stale- 
ness of a statesman's peace cannot take away from 
the reader the tang and sparkle of his day to day 
descriptions of the conflict, moving swiftly from 
one theater of war to another, and yet always 
managing to penetrate beneath the stage trappings 
and masks and to sympathize with those personal 
dramas whose importance the great mass formations 
of battle tended to obscure. This is not to say that 
Gibbs neglects the military movements along the 
way to victory: he surveys the whole panorama of 
warfare and illustrates the critical positions with 
maps. The point is however that he does not stop 
with the materials of the commander-in-chief's re- 
ports : he uses them merely as a dressmaker's dummy 
on which he drapes the colored robes of life. There 
were heroes before Agamemnon, and war corre- 
spondents before Philip Gibbs, but there is an 
Homeric quality in the Englishman's quick and 
forthright narrative, a quality submerged in other 
writers by the pat interests and attitudes of com- 
monplace journalism; and after the mechanical 
elements of the conflict are forgotten Gibbs' 
despatches will be remembered for the reason that 
they dealt with the most tenuous and feeble ele- 
ments of the whole war, the minds and moods of 
men. These are the only materials from which 
enduring things may be made. 

THE PEOPLE'S PART IN PEACE. Ordway 
Tead. 176 pages. Holt. 

After six months of Versailles diplomacy and 
eloquence Mr. Tead's book is unpleasant reading 
a patient effort to describe a vanishing point. When 
these pages were put together we were all talking 
of the people's part in peace; it was an ingredient 
in the necessary anesthesia of war. Now we are 
coming out of ether, and find the real world very 
much as it was before the bloody operation and the 
dream. The people are playing as great a part in 
the peace settlement as the diplomats played at the 
front. And precisely those factors in the war 
situation are now neglected which to Mr. Tead 
some months ago seemed to be the logical and in- 
evitable basis of an international order namely, the 
instruments and methods of international economy 
in the purchase of raw materials, the distribution 
of products, the export of capital, and the control 
of the world's shipping. For these and other pur- 
poses the United States and " the associated govern- 
ments " had created supernational bodies authorita- 
tively coordinating the production and distribution 
of the military and economic necessities of war. 
Now none so poor to do these bodies reverence ;

the old game of uncontrolled competition is re- 
stored catch-as-catch-can, and let the most aggres- 
sive and unscrupulous survive. The flight of events 
has made Mr. Tead's book already historical and 
academic; but the day may come when some other 
men than the antediluvian Prussians of Paris will 
forge a world order; and then the work done in 
this volume will have its use and its reward. 

MORALE AND ITS ENEMIES. By William 

Ernest Hocking. 200 pages. Yale University 

Press. 

An intelligence warm and affirmative here ana- 
lyzes the foundation of morale in war, with the 
idea that in peace some of the same psychological 
factors may be employed to the benefit of the nation. 
Mr. Hocking examined kindly all forms of divided 
mind that weakened our war resolution and advised 
their cure by reason rather than repression. War 
aims must be sincerely stated and restated, the motes 
in our own eye must be so far as possible removed, 
drill and all military routine should be rendered 
intelligible to the soldier by an explanation of their 
symbolism these are examples of his attitude. It 
is not exactly the attitude of an apologist, but it is 
that of a man eager to throw about the effort in 
which one happens to be engaged in a sustaining 
ideology. No one can deny Mr. Hocking's inti- 
macy with his subject or the substantial sound- 
ness of his analysis, but the existence of the astrin- 
gent mood which accompanies a great group effort 
actually did prevent and would always in similar 
circumstances prevent most people from exercising 
his method and moderation. One feels that under 
his touch not only war but revolution, Calvinism, 
or any extreme mode of action or state of mind 
could be made to appear pleasant or at least profit- 
able, whatever its intrinsic validity. This gives his 
advice a tone, perhaps not of unreality, but at least 
of futility. The premise of the book that it is a 
sense of the greatness of the object which carries 
one through the most difficult tasks, and that for 
the better accomplishment of these tasks that sense 
must be so elaborated as to weave through all one's 
minor experiences is incontrovertible. Yet the per- 
fect criticism of the book as a conscious effort to 
inculcate the technique of morale lies in one of Mr. 
Hocking's own sentences: "As a state of the will of 
free men, morale can only be evolved by the man 
himself, his own reaction to his own data." Mr. 
Hocking, for instance, would have made a far 
greater contribution to the morale of the war if he 
had urged that war aims should be stated, not in 
order to improve morale, but for the sincere and 
nai've reason that nothing but the highest aims are 
wortli fighting for. The morale of peace likewise 
can be sustained not by any such makeshifts as the 
retention of military training, but by the adoption of 
a supreme object and the molding of the national 
life for its attainment. 



Books of the Fortnight 

The Vested Interests, and the State of the Industrial 
Arts, by Thornstein Veblen (183 pages; Huebsch), 
presents in book form the series of articles that 
appeared, slightly abridged, in THE DIAL between 
October 19, 1918 and January 25, 1919, under the 
general title The Modern Point of View and the New 
Order. (Review later.) 

New Fallacies of Midas, by Cyril E. Robinson (294 pages ; 
McBride), is a study of the main principles of 
economic and social theory in the light of the ideals 
advanced by the individualist, the socialist, and the 
syndicalist. The author has both a thesis to establish 
and a theory to expound, but he attempts to escape 
the logical aridity of the textbook as well as the 
. special pleading of the propagandist monograph. 
(Review later.) 

How to Face Peace, by Gertrude Shelby (311 pages; 
Holt), outlines the elements of a community program 
of reconstruction. The twenty-seven chapter headings 
are in the form of imperatives: Forward Reeduca- 
tion ! Use Community Labor Boards ! Catch Health ! 
Build Anew! and so forth. The matter is not new, 
but it is freshly and succinctly restated. The ap- 
pended program of discussion and list of books should 
be useful. 

New Schools for Old, by Evelyn Dewey (337 pages; 
Button), makes a contribution at once to the rural 
life movement and to socialized education. It de- 
scribes how a single teacher employed the latent 
resources in a stagnant Missouri farming community 
so as to make the school serve the community, and 
the life of the community center about the school. 
(Review later.) 

The Place of Agriculture in Reconstruction, by James 
B. Morman (374 pages; Dutton), is a comparative 
study of the programs for land settlement in various 
countries. The author is assistant secretary of the 
Federal Farm Loan Board. (Review later.) 

Present Problems in Foreign Policy, by David Jayne 
Hill (361 pages; Appleton), discusses the League of 
Nations program in the light of old-fashioned repub- 
lican principles. It is difficult to decide which is 
worse the League itself or Mr. Hill's reason for 
opposing it. (Review later.) 

What Happened to Europe, by Frank A. Vanderlip (188 
pages; Macmillan), is "the sort of talk" about 
European economic and political conditions that the 
author " might give to a friend ... if there were 
the opportunity to converse at sufficient length." 
(Review later.) 

Albania, by Constarntine A. Chekrezi (255 pages; Mac- 
millan), purports to be the first work of its kind in 
English upon this little-known country. It begins 
with an historical survey, follows the dealings of 
latter-day diplomacy from the Balkan Alliance to 
the end of the Great War, and concludes with a 
valuable section on geographic and economic condi- 
tions. (Review later.) 

Jafon and World Peace, by K. K. Kawakami (196 
pages; Macmillan), is an apology for Japanese real- 
politik. Mr. Kawakami's presentation of Japan's 
case against China will probably diminish the effects 
of his just criticism of Japanese-American relations.

The Problem of the Pacific, by C. Brunsdon Fletcher 
(254 pages; Holt), seeks to show the part that four 
great powers have played during the past century 
in bidding for the political supremacy of the more 
aqueous half of the globe. (Review later.) 

The Russian Collapse, by Boris Kadomtzeff (63 pages; 
Russian Mercantile and Industrial Corporation), 
attempts to account for the disruption of Russia's 
economic system on the grounds that it resulted from 
an initial misapprehension as to the length of the 
war, and that it was given the final coup de grace 
by the blockade. Written from an anti-socialist, anti- 
revolutionary point of view. 

History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, 
by Heinrich von Trejtschke (653 pages; McBride), 
covers the decade 18301840. It is a translation 
by Edan and Cedar Paul, with an introduction by 
William Harbutt Dawson, of the Fifth volume of 
this monumental historical survey, of which earlier 
volumes were reviewed by Max Sylvius Handman 
in THE DIAL for August 30, 1917. (Review later.) 

1914, by Viscount French (386 pages; Houghton Mifflin), 
describes the operations of the armies under his com- 
mand in the first critical days of the war. The 
narrative leads up to an apology for the overthrow 
of Asquith's government, following the famous Times 
disclosure of the munition shortage, inspired by the 
General himself, and it is therefore fittingly dedi- 
cated to Lloyd George, who seems to have anticipated 
the compliment by bestowing the viscountcy. (Re- 
view later.) 

The Dardanelles Campaign, by H. W. Nevinson (427 
pages; Holt), is a well-ordered, fairly well-illus- 
trated, and fairly well-mapped account of one of the 
supreme failures of the war. Incidentally it is an 
apology for the strategic conception of this attack. 
(Review later.) 

The Life of John Redmond, by Warre B. Wells (282 
pages ; N Doran), carries the reader through a gene- 
ration of Home Rule politics, as embodied in the 
personal career of the famous Irish parliamentarian. 
There is no pretense that this essay is a definitive 
biography. (Review later.) 

The Journal of a Disappointed Man, by W. M. P. Bar- 
bellion (312 pages; Doran), the intimate diary of 
an egotist who for twenty-seven years defends his 
joy in living, and his passionate ambition to be 
recognized as a zoologist, from the march of a fatal 
disease has its share of the inevitable dull pages ; 
but its quality is blunt, realistic (if sometimes 
pathological), and provocative. More than one Eng- 
lishman has been suspected of hiding behind this pseu- 
donym ; one wonders whether it were not more profit- 
able to ascertain who edited it. (Review later,) 

The Iron Hunter, by Chase S. Osborn (316 pages; Mac- 
millan), is the autobiography of a man who made 
ore-prospecting his business, and politics, as governor 
of Michigan, his avocation. A book that might pass 
as canal-boy-to-president fiction were it not for the 
blood and iron element. 

Truth, by Sir Charles Walston (233 pages; Cambridge 
University Press), is an examination, from the stand- 
point of " practical idealism," of the application of 
the principle of veracity in political, social, and 
religious life. (Review later.) 



Set Down in Malice, by Gerald Cumberland (286 pages; 
Brentano), proves that the author knows or knows 
something about a very great number of English 
notables in politics and the arts. The book is some- 
times brilliant, often annoying, always stimulating. 
(Review later.) , 

The War and Men's Minds, by Victoria de Bunsen (185 
pages; Lane), examines the foundations of religious 
belief, in the light of Victorian and contemporary 
criticism. The war does not point any religious 
moral to Mrs. de Bunsen it only adorns the tale. 

The Realities of Modern Science, by John Mills (327 
pages; Macmillan), is a well-organized account of 
the concepts and methods of physical science for the 
reader who " finds few clews to recent advances in 
his memories of the formal instruction of school or 
college days." 

Inventions of the Great War, by A. Russell Bond (337 
pages; Century), is an account of war's perversion 
of the inventive genius. Youths of a mechanical 
turn of mind will enjoy reading it and should by 
all means be prevented from doing so. 

The Book of the National Parks, by Robert Sterling 
Yard (420 pages; Scribner), is a piece of pardonable 
propaganda by the Chief of the Educational Division 
of the National Park Service. Mr. Yard is given 
to superlatives, but the scenes he talks about demand 
them. The book is handsomely illustrated with 
photographs and maps. 

The Grizzly, by Enos A. Mills (289 pages; Houghton 
Mifflin), is an account of the author's experiences with 
this canny animal over a period of thirty years. 
" The species impresses one with its superiority, and 
the individuality of each grizzly ever stands out." 
The stories, collectively and severally, give the same 
impression. 

The Solitary, by James Oppenheim (147 pages; Huebsch), 
has for dedication the poet's fine tribute to Randolph 
Bourne, from THE DIAL of January 11. The volume 
contains two general groups Songs Out of Solitude 
and Songs Out of Multitude the free-verse drama 
Night (produced by the Provlncetown Players), and 
a long poem called The Sea. (Review later.) 

Small Things^ by Margaret Deland (326 pages; Apple- 
ton), seems a dangerously" good book. It gives the 
author's impressions of France in 1917 and 1918; 
impressions lucid and quick with sympathy, written 
in those moods of fierce exaltation and generous 
anger and sharp astonishment which the ardor of 
conflict and the presence of danger awoke. The 
sketches do not carry further than September 1918. 
and there is no hint of the disillusion which was to 
follow. (Review later.) 

La Bodega, by Vicente Blasco Ibdnez (368 pages; Dut- 
ton), is this week's Ibanez. The book will be re- 
viewed at an early date, in connection with other 
progeny of this prolific Spanish pen. 

The Haunted Bookshop, by Christopher Morley (289 
pages; Doubleday, Page), reveals a genial assort- 
ment of literary gossip enmeshed in the tangles of 
a belated spy plot. The transparency of the intrigue 
is of slight consequence, however, compared with 
the flavor of a diversified bookish intelligence which 
each page exhales. (Review later.)

The Line-up! 



on one side 
reaction

on the other- 
progress

ON WHICH SIDE OF THE LINE ARE YOU? 

The Dial believes that the only way out of the present world chaos lies 
straight forward along the path of industrial and economic evolution. 
Reaction breeds hatred and hysteria and compels violence. Sane inquiry 
and investigation of the principles of industrial control and their practical 
application lead to progress and not revolution. 

If you are looking ahead and not back you will need the constructive dis- 
cussion of these problems, which is the outstanding characteristic of The 
Dial's editorial policy.

The Case of the Rand School 

THE RAND SCHOOL of Social Science, located in the People's House 
at 7 East 15th Street, New York City, has been unlawfully raided 
by the Lusk Investigating Committee and its agents, its property dam- 
aged, garbled quotations from its correspondence published broadcast, 
to the great detriment of the school in the minds of the public who know 
nothing of its well-established educational work in Socialism and allied 
subjects now in existence for thirteen years. 

The school and its officers and teachers have been denied any hearing to 
present their side of the case and therefore are obliged to appeal to the 
people of the United States for the simplest right of self-defense. 

Protests are being heard from many quarters. The following, from 
sources not in agreement with the theories taught by the school, may be 
cited : 



From the New York World Editorial, July 10, 1919. 

Democrat. 

" It is time for it. (the Lusk Committee) to call a halt 
on itself and stick close to the business it was created 
to do. Its duty is to* conduct an inquiry and to pre- 
pare a report to the Legislature as a guide to future 
action. It is not a tribunal expressly for the convic- 
tion of persons whose opinions its members dislike. In 
making itself judge, jury and prosecuting attorney it 
forgets its proper functions. It is solely a committee 
of investigation, with limited powers, which it seems 
none too well qualified to exercise." 



From the New York Evening Post, July 9, 1919. Re- 
publican. 

" The proceedings [of the Committee] have been 
loose. Speeches by Bolshevist agitators and anarchist 
pamphlets found in the lobby of the Public Library are 
bundled into a blanket indictment against a Socialist 
institution of long standing, and, in general, against a 
party, unquestionably radical, which nevertheless has 
polled heavy votes in the nation and the city for many 
years." 



From The New Republic, July 9, 1919 Liberal Weekly. 
" Shall an instrument of oppression drawn from the 
repertory of the star chamber, used by the notorious 
Chief Justice Scroggs, denounced by the courts &- cen- 
tury and a half ago, assailed by our colonial forbears 
as destructive of liberty and law, and condemned by 
the Supreme Court as ' abhorrent to the instincts of an 
American ' shall such an instrument be revived in the 
twentieth century under a constitution and form of 
government dedicated to liberty and justice?" 



From Samuel Untermyer, Esq., to Hon. Clayton R. 
Lusk, Chairman Lusk Committee : 

" Although it is well-known that I am a pronounced 
anti-Socialist because of my conviction that the govern- 
mental policies of Socialism are not practicable and 
workable and that as a constructive programme it is 
little more than an iridescent dream, I have always 
realized that the Socialist Party has been of great 
service and is destined to be of still greater service in 
curbing and correcting the greed and injustice of the 
capitalistic system and that its usefulness as an oppo- 
sition party has been fully vindicated. . 

" If you believe that these outrages against the pro- 
verbial American sense of fair play and your per- 
sistent refusal to give these people an opportunity to 
be heard will be tolerated, that they will not react 
against the repute and usefulness of your Committee, 
you little understand the American spirit." 



All public spirited citizens who agree with the protests voiced above and desire to assist the 
Rand School in its desperate fight not only for its own right to exist, but for the right of 
the most fundamental constitutional protection for the people of the United States and their 
institutions, are invited to send in the attached slip with contribution.

A FORTNIGHTLY 



I 



Women in British Industry 



N THE AUTUMN OF 1917, before the Armistice, 
the British War Cabinet appointed a Committee to 
enquire into the relations which ought to exist be- 
tween men and women in industry. Like most 
government committees, this body was created not 
because the Government was possessed of fore- 
thought, but purely as a means of escape from an 
immediate embarrassment. Throughout the war, 
grievances and promises connected with women's 
employment had been accumulating at about the 
same rate. As the shortage of men's labor made 
the employment of women more and more neces- 
sary, the Government attempted to make up for 
the deficiency of munitions by increasing the output 
of promises, and rather ambiguously worded guar- 
antees of equal pay and conditions were lavishly ac- 
corded. These promises, however, were never com- 
pletely kept, and from 1915 to 1918 the Trade 
Unions fought a long series of battles for the pur- 
pose of securing their observance. The biggest 
single group of grievances arose out of a singularly 
dishonest subterfuge adopted by the Government. 
Even when it was admitted that women were guar- 
anteed, by agreement and even by legal enactment, 
equal time rates with men, they were refused the 
same advances upon these rates, on the ground that 
war advances were not increases in rates and there- 
fore were not included in the promise. 

It was out of a number of disputes centered prin- 
cipally upon this question that the War Cabinet 
Committee arose. Big strikes were averted by the 
promise of a full enquiry followed by redress of 
grievances. The Government, however, formed its 
committee in a very peculiar way. A judge of 
the High Court was made Chairman, and of the 
other members all except one, Mrs. Sidney Webb, 
were paid officials of the Government a fact which 
made the Committee a singularly unsuitable body 
to pass judgment upon the Government's alleged 
misdeeds. The result is what might have been ex- 
pected. The Majority Report, signed by all the 
members except Mrs. Webb, plentifully white- 
washes the Government and absolves it of all blame 
for the breach of pledges, while Mrs. Webb in her 
Minority Report delivers a trenchant and convinc- 
ing attack upon the Government's perfidy. 



These matters, however, now that hostilities are 
over, belong rather to the past than to the present 
and the main interest attaches to the recommenda- 
tions dealing -with the future status and conditions 
of employment of women in industry. Here again 
there are two reports, one signed by the reactionary 
and official Majority, and the other signed by Mrs. 
Webb alone. In two respects the difference in 
starting point between these two reports is very 
great. The majority set out explicitly to examine 
and discuss the conditions of women's work as a 
peculiar and isolated phenomenon, as if it were an 
anomaly that women should work at all. Mrs. 
Webb, on the other hand, sets out to examine first 
the conditions of employment as they affect both 
sexes, and proceeds on that basis to deal with the 
relations which should exist between them. In 
the second place and this perhaps follows from the 
first point the Majority assume throughout that 
sex differentiation is desirable, whereas Mrs. Webb 
proceeds on the assumption that, particular ques- 
tions apart, sex is as irrelevant to industrial em- 
ployment as color of hair or length of arm. 

We are confronted, then, on practically every 
important point, with a flat contradiction, in both 
attitude and proposal, between the two reports. 
This, however, is not because the Majority is 
frankly and openly reactionary. The length to 
which it advances towards the verbal expression of 
progressive ideas is very eloquent of the change in 
the sex atmosphere which the last few years have 
produced. Even the Majority of today declares in 
words for the principle of " equal pay," though its 
proposals would depart far enough from that prin- 
ciple when they were actually carried into effect. 

The Majority adopts the catch-phrase " Equal 
pay for equal work " and, by a series of glosses, 
make this formula read " Equal pay for equal work 
in quantity and quality at equal cost to the em- 
ployer." It holds that women should receive the 
same pay as men where they turn out as much work, 
do it as well, and do not cost the employer more 
than men in supervision, overhead charges, etc. 

Mrs. Webb, on the other tyand, treating men 
and women together, stands out for the principle 
of the occupational rate or the rate for the job, no 



THE DIAL 



July 26 



matter whether the job is done by a man or a 
woman. This, as the Majority admits, was the 
claim put before the Committee by the men's and 
women's Trade Unions alike, which see in it the 
only safeguard against the sweating of women and 
the undercutting of men's conditions by female 
labor. It was the universal opinion of the Trade 
Union witnesses, as it is the opinion of Mrs. Webb, 
that the " equal pay for equal work " proposals of 
the Majority would be wholly ineffective in prac- 
tice, and that, if once the door was opened to the 
sex-discrimination which they contemplate in both 
time-rates and piece-rates, all pretense at equality- 
would very soon disappear, and the wage relations 
between the sexes would continue to be governed by 
the mainly customary, and wholly unjust, considera- 
tions by which they have been governed in the past. 
In practice, if the principle of sex-discrimination is 
once admitted, all safeguards, except those based 
on economic strength, are destroyed. 

The Majority takes objection to Mrs. Webb's 
proposal of no discrimination, or equal time and 
piece rates, on the ground that it would have the 
effect of restricting greatly the sphere of women's 
employment, which it is desirable and necessary to 
increase in the interests of greater production. Mrs. 
Webb admits that it would have this tendency in 
certain cases, but holds that it would lead to the 
specialization of the sexes in those occupations for 
which they are most fitted, and that this specializa- 
tion is greatly to be desired in the interests of in- 
dustrial efficiency. Moreover, Mrs. Webb agrees 
with the view, which was put before the Com- 
mittee by myself and many other Labor witnesses, 
that it is desirable to encourage women's em- 
ployment only where it can be assured that 
no degradation in the standard of life will take 
place in consequence of their introduction. 

The question of " equal pay," whatever formula 
may be adopted, inevitably concerns primarily those 
occupations in which men and women are employed 
side by side. But from this question the Commit- 
tee was inevitably led on to a discussion of the gen- 
eral levels of men's and women's wages and to the 
consideration of proposals for a minimum wage. 
Both Majority and Minority make recommenda- 
tions on this point; but, here again, their proposals 
are widely different. The Majority recommends a 
minimum wage legally enacted for women only, 
and based on the cost of subsistence for a single 
woman without dependents. Mrs. Webb proposes 
a universal minimum wage applicable to both sexes. 

As soon as the Committee began to discuss the 
legal minimum wage, it found itself involved in a 
much bigger question, that of state provision for 
dependents. The Committee itself collected no evi- 



dence on the number of women workers in industry 
having persons dependent upon them ; but there 
was a quite remarkable conflict of evidence in the 
data collected by previous investigators which the 
Committee had before it. It was at least shown that 
a large proportion of male workers have no depend- 
ents, and that a considerable body of women workers 
have dependents facts that must be considered 
in relation to the national minimum wage. 

But, if wages are to bear any relation to the num- 
ber of dependents, a very great difficulty arises. If 
wages continue to be paid by the private employer, 
it then pays him to employ workers with as few 
dependents as possible. If he follows this policy, 
the consequences for the community are disastrous ; 
for those are flung out of work who have most 
others dependent upon them. It is therefore clear 
that no system of making wages vary with the 
number of dependents is possible except in state 
employment, and that the whole problem of pay- 
ment for dependents, if it is to be dealt with at 
all, must be dealt with by the state out of national 
funds and as a matter wholly distinct from the 
payment of wages. The Majority half-sees ' this, 
but contents itself with vague proposals that the 
whole question should be further considered : Mrs. 
Webb realizes the full implications of the proposal 
for a universal minimum, and its far-reaching conse- 
quences for the wage-system as a whole. 

The position is, indeed, very difficult. The de- 
mand of women for the abandonment of all sex- 
discrimination in industrial conditions is growing 
very strong. It is now usually opposed on the 
ground that a man must receive a " family " wage, 
while a woman need only earn enough to support 
herself. This, however, is both manifestly unfair 
on those women who have dependents and more 
than fair to -those men who have not. It is also a 
royal road to the undercutting of men by women's 
labor, and consequently to a general degradation in 
the standard of life. Yet the adoption of absolutely 
equal pay will serve to emphasize more than ever 
the injustice of paying a single man or woman 
as much as a large family. In the public services, 
such as teaching, it may be possible, as the report 
suggests, to redress the balance by allowances for 
dependents, though even here, unless the whole cost 
of such allowances was borne by the national 
exchequer, there would be a dangerous inducement 
to employ only teachers without dependents. But 
there is clearly no such way out in private industry. 

Both reports, therefore, lead to the threshold of 
a problem which they do not solve, though Mrs. 
Webb gets considerably nearer to the solution than 
the Majority. I myself believe that the only way 
out lies in the proposal put forward by the State

proposes a direct and unconditional allowance from it would, and say, " so much the better." But,

in the country, a basic minimum income below between men's and women's wages and conditions

policy based on Mrs. Webb's formula of occupa- women alike is bound to raise problems far wider 

tional rates without sex discrimination. t h an those immediately presented for discussion.

Two Canals 

The old canal forlorn, forsaken crawls, 
Its locks decayed and its low water stirred 
By minnows, all its past ensepulchred 
In whispering walls. 

Here mystery holds the moments with delight. 

The banks are dark with groves; the paths, half blotted, 

Struggle along the edges bramble-knotted, 

Scentful as night. / , 

The rough-hewn chasm is never entered now. 
The steep walls, viny with forgetfulness, 
Out from their crevices push flower and cress 
And greening bough. 

And parallel, and half a mile away, 
The new canal, a broad deep channel, reaches 
Across the prairie where the sunshine bleaches 
The grass all day. 

Its lines are open to the eye and clear. 
New minds laid out the granite with new science, 
And new invention wrought for time's defiance

Collective Bargaining in Politics 



V^OLLECTIVE BARGAINING " and " the socializa- 
tion of the means of production " are the two 
phrases most familiar in discussions of the inter- 
national labor movement. Now that war and rev- 
olution have restated the Marxian formula with 
new implications, the gap has perceptibly widened 
between the American trade-unionist content with 
collective bargaining, and the proletarian of 
Europe, ambitious to achieve the control of 
industry. 

From the earliest days of the A. F. of L., the 
American labor movement has been predominantly 
economic or better, mercantilistic in character. 
Its ideals have been those of the tradesman its 
mechanism that of the trust. To sell labor in a 
monopolized market; to meet .combination with 
stronger combination and thus to secure a " fair " 
share of the product of industry that is to say, a 
share commensurate with the strength of the labor 
group: such are the aims that hold craft unionism 
everlastingly within a system that deals in labor as 
it deals in logs a system born blind to the pos- 
sibility of the control of industry by the workers. 

The Great War gave to American trade union- 
ism a recognized place in the established order of 
industry. From the conflict Mr. Gompers and Mr. 
Wilson emerged blood brothers in the business of 
defending things as they are, intent first of all upon 
the maintenance of stability. But at the moment 
when the Federation was beginning to purr con- 
tentedly in the lap of a bourgeois civilization, the 
old ambition of European labor was stirring to new 
activity. In America reconstruction was to take the 
form of whitewashing a solid edifice little injured 
by the war. In Europe the capitalistic structure had 
been shaken to its foundations. Stability would 
give the A. F. of L. a sure position among the vested 
interests ; turmoil would offer European labor an 
opportunity for conquest and control indefinitely 
postponed if governmental reconstruction programs 
were allowed to move deliberately to their common 
goal. 

With much to lose, the A. F. of L. had become 
conservative in the full sense of the word ; it was 



trol is to be effected, but no disagreement as to 
means can hide the fact that these movements hold 
their ends in common. The end once achieved, time 
may forget the difference between bullet and ballot ; 
it can never unite a labor movement content to serve 
a bourgeois government with a movement that will 
be satisfied with nothing short of sovereignty. 

It is a matter of some interest that labor leaders 
in England, France, and Italy contemplate the use 
of industrial means to effect political ends the stop- 
page of armed intervention in Russia, for instance. 
Of far greater significance would be a decision on 
the part of the A. F. of L. to use any means for 
the achievement of fundamentally important ends 
of any sort. We have Mr. Gompers' word for it 
that the Federation is not a non-political organiza- 
tion ; since the announcement of its Campaign Pro- 
gram in 1906, the Federation has been instrumental 
in securing the passage of a very considerable 
amount of reformatory legislation. Mr. Gompers 
might have added that the A. F. of L. is not a non- 
industrial organization; craft unionism has won 
much for labor in the way of high wages and en- 
durable working conditions. Federated shop or- 
ganization in industry and party organization in 
politics hold the possibility of control; but the 
A. F. of L. is unambitiously content to bargain col- 
lectively with the acknowledged masters of produc- 
tion and of government, thereby achieving in the 
course of long negotiation an occasional reform. 

The period between the suspension of hostilities 
and the signing of the Great Peace witnessed the 
tnumph of collective bargaining in world politics. 
For a full understanding of what happened at Paris 
it is necessary to delve somewhat into the history of 
international labor relations during the war. The 
1914 convention of the American Federation of 
Labor adopted a resolution which proposed the hold- 
ing of a congress of labor representatives of all 
countries at the same time and place as the Peace 
Congress; this action was reaffirmed by the con- 
ventions of the four succeeding years. In 1916 the 
Federation went a step farther and suggested that 
the labor groups of the several belligerent countries 



inevitable that its interests should clash with those .prevail upon their governments to include labor rep- 



of European radicals who, having gained less, hoped 
everything. Thus there has developed in the two 
movements a fundamental difference in political pol- 
icy which has thrown the forces of American and 
European labor into opposite camps. In Europe the 
control of government is considered necessary to the 
full realization of the labor program. Russia and 
England are not of one mind as to how this con- 



resentatives among their plenipotentiaries to the 
Peace Congress. With America's entrance into the 
war the Executive Council of the American Fed- 
eration of Labor came into most intimate relations 
with the national Cabinet. Direct connections with 
labor groups in Allied countries were not so easily 
established. America was not represented at the 
Inter-Allied Labor and Socialist Conference held 



THE DIAL

in London, February 1918, and when the first 
American labor mission finally sailed for Europe 
it was not armed with powers to negotiate with 
Allied labor for the formulation of a common pol- 
icy, and was at much pains to make it plain that 
the A. F. of L. would not participate in the proposed 
conference with labor representatives from enemy 
countries. The second mission assumed a more pre- 
tentious character; Mr. Gompers himself was the 
chief emissary, and a representative of the Ameri- 
can diplomatic service acted as escort of the party. 
A few sentences from the report of the latter func- 
tionary may prove to be of interest : 

Wherever the Mission went it was received by the 
highest personages as though it had been officially repre- 
senting the Government of the United States. . . . It 
was indeed evident that the French and Italian Socialist 
labor leaders appreciated the honors paid to the American 
Labor Mission as reflecting upon themselves and their own 
class. When the Americans went from luncheon at the 
Quay d'Orsay Palace of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
to confer with the Confederation Generale du Travail at 
its offices in the working class quarter of Paris, the French 
laborer naturally felt that he was receiving a share of 
the honors paid to his American colleagues. 

According to this same State Department report, 
the mission succeeded in making it very plain to the 
restless workers of England, France, and Italy that 
" the attitude of vigorous and militant labor lead- 
ers need not. necessarily be hostile to the govern- 
ment," but that they may merge their interests 
so completely with those of the state as to 
be "worthy of every official _ support." In fact, the 
demeanor of the Americans was so exemplary that 
they earned the good will, not. only of their own 
government, but of every other government with 
which they came in contact- that is to say, of the 
governing class in general. 

At the Inter-Allied Labor and Socialist Con- 
gress of September 1918, the Mission secured the 
adoption of the A. F. of L. war program, providing 
among other things for a world labor congress to 
be held at the same time and place as the Peace 
Congress, and asking for the representation of labor 
in the membership of the latter body. The Ameri- 
cans also made it emphatically clear that they would 
not participate in any war-time conference with 
the enemy. Finally they succeeded in blocking a 
resolution that condemned intervention " in behalf 
of a real democracy " in Russia. 

The history of these activities forms a fitting 
preface to a most interesting diplomatic correspond- 
ence just published by the A. F. of L. While the 
world was still breathlessly awaiting the outcome 
of the negotiations which preceded the armistice, 
Oudegeest of Holland cabled Mr. Gompers (then 
in the United States) asking that the Federation 
appoint delegates to a labor congress to be held at 



the same time and place as the peace conference. 
Mr.- Gompers replied three weeks later that in ac- 
cordance with the instructions of several conven- 
tions of the A. F. of L. he himself proposed in due 
course to issue the call for this labor conference. 
After another month's delay, proposals arrived from 
Henderson of Great Britain, setting out detailed 
plans for a general conference of representatives of 
trades unions and labor parties, from allied, neutral 
and enemy countries, and suggesting that Switzer- 
land be selected as a meeting place, for the reason 
that the persona'1 liberty of Austrian and German 
delegates could not be guaranteed in any but a 
neutral country. Refusing to deal directly with 
Henderson, the A. F. of L. cabled Bowerman, Sec- 
retary of the Parliamentary Committee of the 
British Trade Union Congress, in part as follows: 

. . . the American Federation of Labor delegation 
will meet with delegations from trade unions of all 
national centers but must decline to be governed by 
political parties and hence regard meetings with repre- 
sentatives of political parties conducive to no good results. 

If the Americans had ever at any time been in- 
clined to participate in the International Labor and 
Socialist Congress, eventually held at Berne, this 
idea was banished from their minds at a private con- 
ference such as has prepared the way for more 
than one open covenant openly arrived at. A man 
who was present at the conference has related to 
the writer just what took place there; it is sup- 
posed that this is the first publication of detailed 
information relative to this affair. Like most con- 
ferences with the President of the United States, 
this session was a short one ; no time was wasted 
by the American labor delegates in stating their 
case. The meeting at Berne was certain to be 
predominantly socialistic; the Americans were bona 
fide trade unionists, with no taste for politics; if 
they went to Berne they would surely be voted 
down and would be obliged to bolt the conven- 
tion; it was considered best that the Americans 
should absent themselves from this too ambitious 
gathering. Mr. Wilson listened, looking the 
labor spokesman " straight in the eye." "Gentle- 
men," he said, " I agree with you entirely." 

If the good resolutions of the delegates required 
further reinforcement, this was supplied at a con- 
ference with members of the American Commis- 
sion to Negotiate Peace. Here the shady char- 
acter of the Berne conference was again discussed; 
it appeared certain that the delegates to the trade 
union section as well as those to the political sec- 
tion would be Socialists, chiefly interested in polit- 
ical aims; yes, the Americans should by all means 
stay away. 

They did stay away. " While the Berne confer-

ence was refusing to condemn the Bolsheviki, fail- 
ing to fix the war responsibility upon the Germans 
or to remove the International [Trade Union] 
Secretariat from Berlin, and declaring for an im- 
possible international super-parliament, the A. F. 
of L. delegation " buzzed busily in the diplomatic 
sunshine of Paris; the American Socialists champed 
the bit on the farther shore of the Atlantic, held 
up by the passport bureau; two Social Democrats 
got as far as France and then repudiated the con- 
ference; a third member of the same brotherhood 
was discredited when he attempted to speak at Berne. 
Mr. Gompers did not succeed even passably well 
in his attempt to get together at Paris an inter- 
allied trade union congress, and the Peace Confer- 
ence Commission on International Labor Legisla- 
tion began its work with no general policy to guide 
the labor leaders except that embodied in the pro- 
gram adopted at the Inter-Allied Conference of 
September 1918. Since the close of the Commis- 
sion's labors, Mr. Gompers has complained that he 
did not have the support of the radicals for his 
more advanced reformatory measures; he could ex- 
plain this situation if he would; another American 
who attended the sessions of the Commission has 
done so, and the explanation is this: the radicals 
were not deeply interested in welfare measures be- 
cause their eyes were always upon the political 
possibilities of the Peace foolishly enough, they 
insisted on trying to plant in the International 
Labor Conference, under the shadow of the League 
of Nations, the seeds of a workingman's world gov- 
ernment! The day that the American Federation 
of Labor appeared in Europe ready to trade un- 
limited support of the old order for limited reforms, 
this high aspiration of the internationalists was 
doomed to failure. At the last moment when it 
seemed that Lloyd George must be acting under the 
urge of British Labor in his efforts to modify the 
treaty, Mr. Gompers cabled President- Wilson for 
instructions as to what action the A. F. of L. was 
expected to take. In compliance with the Presi- 
dent's answering cablegram, the convention of the 
Federation voted by a majority of 29,909 to 420 to 
indorse the Covenant of the League of Nations 
with its labor provisions (now " somewhat weak- 
ened," says the President), and by implication the 
Treaty as a whole. The world labor conference 
had come short of its object; the promised inter- 
allied conference was a failure ; the thoroughly gov- 
ernmentalized Commission on International Labor 
Legislation had fathered a governmentalized In- 
ternational Labor Conference to carry on its work 
under the League. In and out of the A. F. of L., 
honest eagerness to win the war had found its 
parallel in indifference to a lost peace. 



If American labor in this time of opportunity did 
less than the war made possible, it was not for 
lack of power but for lack of will. The plain fact 
of the matter is that the men who control the Amer- 
ican trade union movement do not want to partic- 
ipate in the control of industry. The craft unions 
that have matured under their guidance are hot so 
organized as to be capable of assuming the rights 
and responsibilities inherent in the control of pro- 
duction. The habit of collective bargaining has 
been carried over into politics, where the labor lobby 
forces the individual measures it desires by the 
threat of boycott the use of a political " unfair 
list." Neither in politics nor in industry does the 
Federation accept any responsibility except to its 
members; by economic pressure it may impose con- 
ditions upon an employer which will eventually de- 
stroy his business, thus curtailing production ; by 
political pressure it may force an administration 
into a position distasteful to itself and to the public ; 
the public may then vote the administration out 
of office, but the union is invulnerable. The laborer 
as such has no part in the responsible direction 
either of politics or of industry. 

And yet a few of the men bound within this 
system are beginning to dream of control. Con- 
fessedly the ambition is chiefly economic, and eco 
nomic means suggest themselves as most natural 
for its attainment. As this ambition widens, shop- 
unit and industrial organization will gradually re 
place the craft system, and as the possibilities of 
labor control become self-evident, impatience with 
the government conservator of the old order 
must grow astoundingly. What shall we do with 
the government? There are three answers: 

" Kill ambition, and support the state," says tht 
trade unionist. " Smash the government and 
start over," says the Russian Bolshevist. " Con- 
trol the government and make it over as you go 
along," says the British Labor Party man. 

Control the government! By votes? Yes! By 
partisan organization such as is growing up in 
Seattle, Detroit, Chicago, New York? Yes! By 
strikes? By boycotts? Yes! The men who are 
today doing most to eliminate the possibility of 
violent revolution here in the United 'States are 
not those who deny that anything new is hap- 
pening in the world, or those who use the 
machinery of state to sweep back the rising tide 
of proletarian ambition, but those who stand ready 
to use any device that will effect in the government 
immediate and partial changes in terms of the new 
time, thus making the means of violent revolution 
superfluous by peaceful achievement of its ends.

Swamp or Civilization ? 



ALL THE MAJOR MEASURES which the last 
Congress failed to pass, Secretary Lane's repatria- 
tion project is the one that will suffer least by delay 
and further reconsideration. The project is an 
unusual blend of statesmanlike vision and political 
myopia. Its motives are the highest, and so are, in 
a general way, its preconceptions and its methods. 
As a clear recognition of the need of creating better 
rural communities, it deserves praise. As a sincere 
attempt to plan broadly in that direction, it is alto- 
gether admirable. But there is obvious in the plan 
a fatal neglect of the wider aspects of agrarian 
policy the very same neglect that, in a grosser 
form, worked such havoc in the United States dur- 
ing the decades following the Civil War, when 
hundreds of thousands of lives, East and West, 
were doomed to poverty and wretchness by the sup- 
posedly beneficent homestead laws that lured whole 
villages from the Atlantic Seaboard to the unplowed 
prairies of the Mississippi Valley. It is another and 
subtler manifestation of that inveterate and narrow 
individualism which has always been the curse of 
American Government. 

The project proposes a transaction between the 
Government and the individual soldier which leaves 
America out of the reckoning. It satisfies three dis- 
tinct interests: the Government's interest in putting 
soldiers promptly back to civilian work, the Gov- 
ernment's lesser interest in improving and dispos- 
ing of its public lands, and the soldier's interest in 
getting a fresh start in life and becoming independ- 
ent. Each of these three interests is wholly praise- 
worthy, and the project, in so far as it furthers 
them, is equally so. Unfortunately, though, there 
are many other interests that ought to be, but have 
not been, reckoned with. And the two largest are 
the interests of the American farmer and the Ameri- 
can rural community. In brief, the interest of 
nearly fifty million citizens. 

The project consists of four major programs, 
reclamation of arid and swamp lands, soldier labor, 
Federal financing of soldier farms, and community 
development. The vast rich-soiled deserts like the 
Colorado Basin and the far vaster wilderness of 
stump and swamp that stretch malarially from 
Louisiana to New Jersey are the chief regions to be 
converted into farms for soldiers. They lie, in the 
main, from ten to twenty miles from the nearest 
rural communities worthy of the name. Once re- 
claimed, they will indubitably yield rich harvests. 
If, now, we grant the wisdom of converting these 
wastes into farms for doughboys, we must grant 
the excellence of the rest of the project. Excel- 



lent is Secretary Lane's scheme for, employing the 
soldiers in draining and irrigating work and in town 
building, for educating them in agriculture during 
this tedious period of reclamation, for accepting their 
labor in part payment for their new farms and for 
financing these farms on easy terms. Excellent, 
above all, is his scheme ,of preparing, not isolated 
farms, but entire rural communities after the fash- 
ion of the Durham plan which Ellwood Mead has 
developed so brilliantly in California. It is impossi- 
ble to deny that every soldier-farmer community 
which Secretary Lane might create on the pattern 
laid down would be a place of joy and profit for the 
inhabitants thereof. 

But how about the wisdom of conquering more 
wilderness? As an emergency measure to absorb 
promptly an army of unemployed soldiers, the 
project would have been valuable if it could have 
been enacted before the armistice and rushed, into 
operation. But we must judge the project, when it 
again comes up for consideration, not as a hurry 
call to ward off idleness and unrest, but rather as 
a part of a national agrarian policy. As such, it 
cannot be wholeheartedly approved. And there are 
signs that the sponsors no longer give undivided 
allegiance to all its original features. Secretary 
Lane's own replies to some critics indicate that he 
is losing his first faith in the measure as a reclama- 
tion project and is now trying to remodel it into 
something more rational. The remodeling however 
has not yet occurred. 

Superficially, the project marks a long advance 
in rural reconstruction. But in reality it is only a 
brilliant evasion. A goodly number of men intimate 
with agricultural affairs have predicted its failure: 
some say that few soldiers will be attracted to such 
remote and inhospitable regions, and that most of 
those who are attracted will speedily be disillusioned 
and will as speedily return to civilization. I hesi- 
tate to join the ranks of these prophets; so great is 
man's eagerness to get something for nothing, and 
so strong is the lure of the open in many youthful 
breasts that almost any Government proposal to 
give away real estate will attract hundreds of the 
ill-informed and impetuous. But I hope the prophets 
are right, for, if they are, it will at last prove that 
American youth is interested in civilization. 

But what if the prophets are wrong, as Secretary 
Lane feels sure they are? Suppose several hundred 
thousand young men trained in the ways of modern 
army life elect to become pioneers under Federal 
patronage. Suppose they stick to their choice. Sup- 
pose they create model farms and villages on the 



THE DIAL 



July 26 



Last Frontier. Suppose they bring, within a few 
years, wives from other places. What of it? 

Well, thousands of farm communities would be 
robbed of the very men they sorely need in the huge 
task of rural reconstruction which lies ahead. It 
will not be the loss of man-power that will be most 
serious. Far from it man-power is of declining 
importance on the American farm, thanks to the 
new tractor, which enables fewer men to handle 
larger acreage, and good roads, which enable farm- 
ers to draw workers from a much wider field than 
ever before. It is rather the loss of the training, the 
youthful enthusiasm, the throb of fresh life and the 
vivid example of the new community spirit that will 
be most heavily felt. 

In the seventies and eighties such a loss crushed 
the very breath of life out of hundreds of villages 
in New England and New York and sent the value 
of Eastern farm lands down to the bare cost of 
their barns. And we must expect a similat result 
tomorrow if we set in motion an enterprise that will 
take away from the home towns their best young 
men. It is not necessary that Secretary Lane's plan 
attract men by the million, in order to work grave 
injury. The harm will develop visibly, if as many 
as 100,000 ex-soldiers are taken. For there are 
other irresistible forces at work draining our rural 
districts. The negroes are still pouring out of the 
South, tempted by the prospects in Northern towns 
and goaded by abominable mistreatment at home; 
this exodus will work deep injury to both town and 
country life before it ceases. Again, there is the 
widespread reluctance of our returning soldiers to 
go back to rural homes. Having seen the great 
world, they are all too willing to linger longer. 
Country school teachers, too, drawn by the thou- 
sands into war work at which they received at least 
a living wage and often much more, are naturally 
refusing to go back to the little red school house 
under the old humiliating, health-wrecking condi- 
tions of overwork and underpay. These and many 
other violent changes are today demoralizing rural 
communities everywhere. Any enterprise which 
further drains off the youth, the intelligence, and 
the feeble social forces of these districts must be 
condemned as imperiling a situation already peril- 
ous. 

Now there are many ways of giving farms to our 
ex-soldiers without further injuring country life. 
One obvious way is to plant soldier-farmer com- 
munities in the midst of moderately populated agri- 
cultural counties from the potato lands of the Aroos- 
took to the lemon groves of San Diego. So far as 
possible, partly improved land might be bought up 
within a convenient distance from a village. Every 
good feature of the Durham plan might be pre- 



served; all roads, wells, fences, houses, and barns 
might be put in order under the supervision of 
Government experts. Community centers might be 
built, and farmers might be established around each 
one in numbers large enough to make it feasible to 
conduct cooperative buying, selling, live-stock breed- 
ing, and similar group enterprises. 

Plainly the soldier farmers would, as individ- 
uals, gain everything in such a community that they 
would in a brand new, isolated reclamation village. 
They can get just as fertile land in partly improved 
districts as in the wilderness. Every student of 
agrarian affairs knows this, and recent surveys by 
the Department of Labor abundantly re-verify it. 
For instance, in the state of Georgia alone, more 
than 8,000,000 acres of improved acreage ready to 
be plowed and planted immediately can be bought 
on the open market at prices ranging from one to 
ten dollars per acre or much less than the cost of 
many drainage and irrigation projects. Georgia is 
not at all peculiar in this respect ; almost every East- 
ern state offers millions of fertile improved acres at 
a price of twenty-five dollars or less per acre. As 
for profits, our soldier-farmers will obviously attain 
them much earlier in established communities than 
on any reclamation tract where from one to three 
years must be spent in bringing the soil up to the 
point of tilling. Indeed, many improved lands in 
the East and South could have been plowed this 
summer and made to show a profit at harvest. This 
fact is less important commercially than psychologi- 
cally. The average young man is eager for results. 
He chafes under tedious delays and hard prelimi- 
naries. Confronted with a year or more of ditch 
digging and stump pulling, he is likely to lose 
heart and go back to town. But if he can at once 
see his farm growing green under his touch, he will 
preserve much of his advance enthusiasm for rural 
life. 

It is not such personal advantages, however, that 
turn the scale against the wilderness plan. It is 
rather the wider social influences our soldier-farmers 
cannot fail to exercise upon the established com- 
munities in which we should plant them. Immeas- 
urably more important than reclaiming wilderness 
is the reclaiming of our farms and villages. Bring- 
ing water to the Colorado Basin is a splendid 
achievement; but bringing fresh blood, new ideas, 
social intercourse, and modern agricultural tech- 
nique to the typical narrow, suspicious, clique-ridden 
country town is one of the half-dozen most impor- 
tant social enterprises of this generation. To say 
that rural life cries for an intelligent humanizing 
spirit is to utter a commonplace, but it is a common- 
place which the repatriation plan has totally ignored. 
Ten thousand villages in the United States might 



1919 



THE DIAL

be revolutionized with amazing speed if in each 
one there were set down a few hundred eager 
youngsters fresh from the A. E. F., hard as nails, 
their minds open to the infinite possibilities of team 
work, and their energies all skilfully coordinated 
under expert leadership for the scientific farming of 
ten or twenty thousand acres. Precisely the same 
thing would happen on the farms as happened in 
the munition factories here and abroad during the 
past three years; the "dilution of labor" would 
proceed from the community manager and his 
trained staff downward to the soldier farmers, and 
thence still further downward to the ignorant far- 
mers and hired men of the entire district, thanks 
to the constant contact between the trained and the 
untrained in the community center; and, along with 
this swift dissemination of farm knowledge and 
technique, would inevitably go that same socializing 
process which everybody has observed at work in 
the army itself. A hundred thousand soldiers set 



to work in the Colorado Basin would reclaim the 
desert and win homes for themselves. A hundred 
thousand soldiers set to work in five hundred old 
rural districts would reclaim a million back-water 
Americans, win homes for , themselves, and make a 
hundred thousand other homes fit to live in. They 
would create five hundred Social Units after the 
pattern of the Cincinnati experiment and thereby 
solve in one act the two problems of repatriation 
and democracy. 

The wilderness, can wait the village cannot. It 
is our national duty to exert every intelligent effort 
to counteract the paralyzing effects of the steady 
drift from farm to town, which we cannot hope to 
check and which, if not neutralized by constructive 
democracy, will certainly develop a host of social 
ills. Let us leave the swamps, then, to their herons 
and water moccasins for an aeon or two, and march 
our young army into civilization.

The Irish Renaissance Renascent 



.HAT THE "LULL IN POLITICS/' postulated some 
twenty-five years ago by Mr. W. B. Yeats as the 
condition precedent of a literary renaissance, has 
ceased is evident from the books of this spring sea- 
son. The publishers' lists are meager, and pre- 
dominantly political; "mere literature" has so far 
receded that we are coming to regard the Irish 
Literary Revival as a chapter definitely closed. A 
generation has arisen whose thoughts are haunted by 
Reconstruction, The League of Nations, the Four- 
teen Points, where its predecessors were immersed 
in the legendary lore of Celtic antiquity, the restora- 
tion of the national tradition in literature, and the 
building up of an Irish folk-theater. It is true, the 
return to Dublin of Mr. Yeats could not but involve 
some organized effort to create an oasis of artistic 
interest in the desert of burning political preoccupa- 
tion, and true to his nature and life-long habit he 
signalized his reabsorption by mobilizing the non- 
political remnant on behalf of two enterprises as 
aloof as himself from the turmoil of the market- 
place. The Abbey Theatre became at the beginning 
of the winter the center of a course of lectures and 
debates, at which prominent writers both English 
and Irish entertained the plain people with dis- 
courses and discussions on art, literature, music, and 
economics. Mr. Bernard Shaw was heard with the 
impatience which he never fails to arouse in his 
compatriots, Mr. G. K. Chesterton enjoyed the 
equally inevitable good humor with which Ireland 
applauds the sympathetic Englishman, Mr. H. W. 



Nevinson lectured on his experiences in starved Ger- 
many. A great number of Sunday erening enter- 
tainments were given during the season, and the 
public particularly welcomed the opportunity thus 
provided for the airing of views which would not 
have passed unmutilated the blue-pencil of the Peace 
Censor. The Abbey became a species of neutral 
enclave, and whatever the subject, the public dis- 
cussion always developed tendencies now conveni- 
ently known as " Bolshevist." So much for one of 
Mr. Yeats's efforts to induce detachment. 

The second experiment has had more success in 
achieving its avowed object, namely the resuscita- 
tion of the uncommercial drama. The Abbey The- 
atre having long since succumbed to the ease of 
popularity, it could not be looked to for any of the 
experimental work, which it at one time was not 
afraid to risk. In consequence, a meeting was called 
by Mr, W. B. Yeats, Mr. James Stephens, Mr. 
Lennox Robinson, and myself for the purpose of 
considering ,the establishment of a Dublin Drama 
League, for the production of plays which could not 
be expected from any of the existing theaters in this 
city. The proposal was favorably received, and the 
League was constituted, with a membership which 
has steadily grown since last September. Plays by 
Andreiev, Dunsany, and Srgjan Tucic, a Serbian 
playwright, have been produced under the auspices 
of the League, and there is every reason to believe 
that we shall now be able to fulfill that part of the 
program of the original dramatic movement which

was abandoned when Mr. Edward Martyn and Mr. 
W. B. Yeats separated, after the brief career of 
the Irish Literary Theatre. Foreign plays have 
been practically inacessible to the Irish public for 
some years, and the too exclusive concern of the 
Abbey Theatre with popular folk-melodrama has 
made necessary the constitution of a group interested 
in supporting the plays which no self-respecting 
repertory theater can be without. In a recent de- 
bate at the Abbey Theatre on the subject of that 
institution's present decadence, Mr. Yeats has in- 
voked the shade of Synge in defense of the neglect of 
modern drama in favor of the peasant play, but 
there is no doubt his opponent, Mr. Lennox Robin- 
son, had the best of the argument, in which he ad- 
vocated the production of good foreign plays rather 
than bad native plays. Meanwhile, as our repertory 
theater refuses to do its duty, the Drama League 
has undertaken it, under the presidency of the other- 
wise unrepentant Mr. Yeats. 

If Mr. Yeats is unrepentant in his defense of the 
inactivity of the Abbey Theatre, and yet an advocate 
of the Drama League, it is largely because he has 
always shown a disconcerting independence of logic. 
The contradictory record of his own dramatic 
theories, from the time when he spurned the draw- 
ing-room play in favor of that which would " uplift 
the man of the roads " to the present day, is suffi- 
cient evidence of his scorn of mere consistency. In 
the long course of experiment which has constituted 
his relation to the theater he has now- arrived at the 
point of desiring an escape from that defiant in- 
stitution, and in the Anglo-Irish Noh play he pro- 
fesses to have found salvation. In Two Plays for 
Dancers (Dundrum; Cuala Press) he has given for 
a new volume in the beautiful editions of his sister's 
hand press his first book of Anglo-Irish Noh plays, 
containing The Dreaming of the Bones and The 
Only Jealousy of Emer. Two years ago, when Mr. 
Yeats published At the Hawk's Well, his first ex- 
periment in the Japanese manner, he announced 
that he had at last discovered the solution of the 
problem presented to him as a poet-dramatist by the 
modern stage: 

My blunder has been that I did not discover in my 
youth that my theatre must be the ancient theatre made 
by unrolling a carpet, or marking out a place with a stick, 
or setting a screen against a wall. Certainly those who 
care for my kind of poetry must be numerous enough, if 
I can bring them together, to pay half a dozen players 
who can bring all their properties in a cab and perform 
in their leisure moments. 

At the Hawk's Well was produced in accordance 
with the Noh tradition, the players wearing masks 
and " sitting against a screen covered with some one 
unchangeable pattern." It is they who " describe 
landscape or event, and accompany movement with 



drum or gong, or deepen the emotion of the words 
with zither or flute." The stage is a platform sur- 
rounded on three sides by the audience, the move- 
ments are founded on those of puppets, and song and 
dance alternate with speech. 

In Tw 7 o Plays for Dancers Mr. Yeats has par- 
tially redeemed his promise to complete a " dramatic 
celebration of the life of Cuchulain planned long 
ago," of which the Hawk's Well was the first part. 
The Only Jealousy of Emer is a further episode in 
the Cuchulain series, and may be described 35 a 
sequel to On Baile's Strand. It is a subtle and 
tenuous drama, whose scene is laid in a fisherman's 
hut where, after he had rushed into the sea on learn- 
ing that his unknown antagonist was his son, 
Cuchulain's lifeless body has been brought. His 
wife Emer has called his mistress, Eithne Inguba, 
to see if her love can call Cuchulain back to life. 
He has been lured by a Woman of the Sidhe, and 
only by a renunciation of their ultimate hope of 
reconciliation can Emer restore her husband to this 
world. The Noh form is peculiarly adapted to the 
suggestive beauty of the poetry in which the drama- 
tic conceptions of Mr. Yeats develop. Heightened 
by the conventions of movement, the gestures of the 
Noh performers, his effects are secured in a manner 
impossible on the ordinary stage, where the author's 
own dissatisfaction is only too often shared by the 
public. The oft revised and never satisfactory 
Shadowy Waters might be re-written in the Noh 
manner with results heretofore unachieved. 

With The Dreaming of the Bones there enters 
to the Irish mind, at least an element of regret 
that an exotic form should have been allowed to 
hamper a theme peculiarly national. In the meeting 
between a young man escaping from the Dublin 
Rising in 1916 and the shades of Dermot and 
Devorgilla, whose love betrayed Ireland, Mr. 
Yeats had a situation which demanded other treat- 
ment. Moving and beautiful as the poem now 
reads, one's fancy dwells upon its potentialities as a 
play to set beside Cathleen ni Houlihan, and one is 
tempted to clamor for what might be, instead of 
considering what is ... irrevocably, so far 
as the creative impulse is concerned, for these Anglo- 
Irish Noh plays are the creatures of a mood. Mr. 
Yeats refers to them more than once as a passing 
phase of experimental effort, but they are definite 
evidence of a revolt against the mechanism of the 
modern stage, however intellectual it may become. 
Yet, while we may welcome any^theory which seems 
to provide Mr. Yeats with the necessary stimulus to 
write poetic plays, it is clear that the drama cannot 
be restored to dignity by a negation of the material 
framework of its existence. Theater reformers 
move towards a species of dramatic Nirvana, elim-

mating scenery, actor, audience. When there are 
no playgoers to be bored by impossible plays, no 
dramatists to be subordinated to scenic effects, and 
no actors to interfere with the poetry of ideal speech, 
then we shall have the euthanasia of the Higher 
Drama. 

If to the detachment of Mr. W. B. Yeats we 
owe the appearance this spring of no less than three 
volumes, which make up for the dearth already re- 
ferred to, he is not the only Irish writer capable of 
the implied absorption in matters far removed from 
the current political turmoil. Rather than discuss 
The Wild Swans at Coole [reviewed on page 72 
of this issue of THE DIAL] and The Cutting of 
an Agate, which appears, with a new chapter, for 
the first time in this part of the world, although 
published seven years ago in America, I prefer to 
close with the story of what promised to be the most 
entertaining instance of fiddling while Europe burns. 

A well-known Anglo-Irish novelist and auto- 
biographer heard from his publisher that a book 
which the latter was bringing out contained an allu- 
sion to the fictitious character of the love affairs so 
complacently related in his four volumes of auto- 
biography. Whereupon he wrote to the publisher 
demanding the suppression of the passage impugning 
his veracity as an Irish Casanova, and arguing that 
this doubt cast upon his amorous capacities was a 



slur upon his autobiographical honor, and an injury 
to his literary property. The novelist stated that he 
was prepared, if the author refused to be censored, 
to go into court and prove the authenticity of his 
sexual adventures. As soon as this delightful news 
reached Dublin, the host of the plaintiff's victims 
rejoiced exceedingly at the prospect of seeing their 
tormentor made ridiculous by his own confessions, 
of vindicating themselves, and of establishing the 
mendacity of the autobiography in question, in so 
far as it related to persons and facts within their 
knowledge. As the Irish Theatre once appeared in 
the dock at Philadelphia, so now it seemed as if the 
Irish literary movement would be seen in the witness 
box, at a trial unique in the history of letters. Un- 
fortunately the innocent calumniator, the author of 
the offending passage, was intimidated by his 
publisher's strange methods of censorship, and with- 
drew his allusion to the contrast between Hazlitt, 
who entertained the public with his real love af- 
fairs, and the Boswell of Dublin, who shocked the 
public with his imaginary love affairs. Thus it has 
not yet been tested whether an author has property 
rights in his amours, and a British jury has not been 
invited to redeem Mr. George Moore and his lady 
friends from the scandalous imputation of virtue. 

ERNEST A. BOYD. 



An Irishman's Burden 



u, 



p TO NOW the intellectual Irishman who busied 
himself with politics has been in a nearly ideal 
situation to reach an early and sound maturity. If 
it was a question of the Empire, detachment was 
his by right of the Irish Channel and the enormities 
of Cromwell. If it was a question of home politics, 
he could begin where the veterans leave off. 
Schooled to look for even less than politics can 
usually offer, there was no reason why he should 
not achieve betimes just the degree of disillusion- 
ment which is antecedent to wisdom. Age is of the 
essence of the matter. For an idealism that might 
at forty sour into cynicism can be kept sweet if it is 
touched at, say, thirty with a reasonable skepticism 
which sharpens the powers of analysis without 
paralyzing effort or extinguishing hope. 

The late Lieutenant T. M. Kettle had such 
precocity thrust upon him for the health of his soul. 
To the realism which was his by right of 
geographical position, he added an extraordinary 
wit and abundant imaginative resources. Slight as 
is the evidence afforded by The Day's Burden 
(Scribner), it is still clear that he must have been 
one of the most gifted of the younger Irishmen who 



gave their lives for the Empire. The book is only a 
miscellany made up of popular talks on political, 
social, and literary subjects, published in a slender 
volume abroad in 1910, and now expanded to 
include fugitive newspaper and magazine articles 
written before the outbreak of the war. Some of 
the sketches are little more than whimsies, others 
purely topical; but whether he was reporting a 
Socialists' Congress at Stuttgart or dealing with the 
inhvman ritual of the Criminal Assizes, Kettle was 
a workman who knew how to take loving pains, 
and the slightest fragments are polished until they 
glitter. Indeed the writing here and there is a bit 
too scintillant: it passes the line between stimulation 
and fatigue. To those who are looking for dinner 
mots that will pass the test of the new psychology, 
it is a pleasure to recommend the book, especially 
since they will find their coveted brilliants em- 
bedded in a substance enormously solider than the 
prevailing market article. 

Kettle had no private solution of the Irish 
problem to urge and he discusses it only incidentally 
in the course of an incisive review of M. Pau.I- 
Dubois' L'Irlande Contemporaine and a general 



THE DIAL

paper on the philosophy of government. He was a 
Home-Ruler of the type that has been submerged 
by the new tidal wave; nevertheless, he was ready 
to make out in 1905, on the strength of purely 
English authority, an unanswerable case for 
revolution if revolution had been feasible. For 
although his main concern as an economist was 
in the building up of a modern civilization which 
should banish the ancient curse of poverty, he saw 
the political and the economic strands as 
inextricably interwoven and he insisted that those 
politicians who kept strife alive were playing the 
part of economic realists as surely as any workers 
" on the land or at the loom." True, Ireland 
needed peace in order to concentrate her energy on 
basic problems. " But that peace from the purely 
political struggle, which is so indispensable if 
Ireland is to develop character and create material 
wealth, can come to her only as a result of political 
autonomy. " Until that is granted England is the 
enemy. But his attitude to. the Irish problem, 
which can have no more than an academic interest 
in view of the new phase, is interesting chiefly for 
the light it throws on his sane notions of nationalism 
in general. They were never superheated, and it is 
doubtful whether he would have been as staggered 
as most of our idealists by the delirium of the 
moment. His conception of society was thoroughly 
dynamic and Home Rule meant for him a bivouac 
on the road and not a barracks. It was a corollary 
from his thoughts on government and the state, 
about which there can be nothing sacrosanct. To 
dream of finalities is. nowadays to indulge the most 
futile and vicious of Utopian fallacies, because, 
apart from the certain disenchantment to which it 
must lead, it is always and everywhere the state of 
mind which produces a dogmatic conservatism and 
stands in the way of progress. Once recognize that 



the state exists for the happiness of man and not 
man for the glory of the state, and countless bogies 
lose their sinister grip on the imagination. The 
sacred " law and order " of the leader writers, for 
example, are no longer absolutes but only means to 
an end to be judged on precisely the same footing 
as any other. " The cry of ' order for order's sake ' 
is as ruinously foolish "as that of art for art's sake, 
or money for money's sake. It is for the sake of 
humanity that all these things must exist. " 

In his treatment of labor, however, Kettle showed 
a tendency to fudge. He doesn't rush out to 
embrace the full implications of his evolutionary 
doctrine. Confronted with the portent of Larkinism, 
he failed to grasp its significance, stubbornly 
refusing to believe that labor was struggling 
towards a new orientation. As he saw it, the 
worker was already won to the " schematic essence " 
of our Western civilization and the sole remaining 
task was to rally him to its actual shape by so 
transforming the latter as to make it " fit for the 
habitation of the idea. " He was sympathetic and 
humane, eager to see " fair play, " but the best he 
could do was to anticipate some of our own 
disturbed sociologists in similar circumstances and 
thunder in the index while purring in the program. 
He rated the employers and threatened them with 
nightmarish horrors to come, but he never got be- 
yond hours and wages and living conditions. The 
real problem he never even posed. And his appeal 
was almost wholly to good will. Was it because he 
was a good Catholic and could not prevent himself 
from throwing on the traditional individual ethics 
a weight it was hardly meant to bear? Possibly. 
But he was in general a good psychologist and his 
error lay rather, I suspect, in underestimating the 
weight than in overestimating the available good 
will.

July 4, 1919 



Grim darkness broods above the stricken earth, 
Still as old terror swooping from the sky; 
The nets of death are wrenched apart and lie 
Across the meadows, barbed with savage mirth. 
More dread than war, peace stares upon her dearth 
With the dead eyes of her insanity. 
This hungry peace, that does not live nor die, 
Smiling at the vain victory of birth. 

There is no scent of dawn, no sea-wind blowing 
To sweep away this ancient evil grief. 
The world is sick: simple desire is going; 
Power lames wisdom ; love is but a thief. 
Nothing is here worth suffering and knowing 
But the sharp moment, profitless and brief.

Baseball 



I 



N THE WORLD'S HISTORY baseball is a new game: 
hence new to song and story and uncelebrated in the 
fine arts of painting, sculpture, and music. Now, 
as Ruskin has pointed out, people generally do not 
see beauty or majesty except when it has been first 
revealed to them in pictures or other works of art. 
This is peculiarly true of the people who call them- 
selves educated. No one who prides himself on 
being familiar with Greek and Roman architecture 
and the classic masters of painting would for a 
moment admit that there could be any beauty in a 
modern sky-scraper. Yet there can be no doubt that 
when two thousand years hence some Antarctic 
scholar comes to describe our civilization, he will 
mention as our distinctive contribution to art our 
beautiful office buildings, and perhaps offer in sup- 
port of his thesis colored plates of some of the ruins 
of those temples of commerce. And when he comes 
to speak of America's contribution to religion, will 
he not mention baseball? Do not be shocked, gentle 
or learned reader! I know full well that baseball 
is a boy's game, and a professional sport, and that 
a properly cultured, serious person always feels 
like apologizing for attending a baseball game in- 
stead of a Strauss concert, or a lecture on the customs 
of the Fiji Islanders. But I still maintain that, by 
all the canons of our modern books on comparative 
religion, baseball is a religion, and the only one that 
is not sectarian but national. The essence of relig- 
ious experience, we are told, is the " redemption from 
the limitations of our petty individual lives and the 
mystic unity with a larger life of which we are a 
part." And is not this precisely what the baseball 
devotee or fanatic, if you please, experiences when 
he watches' the team representing his city battling 
with another? Is there any other experience in mod- 
ern life in which multitudes of men so completely 
and intensely lose their individual selves in the 
larger life which they call their city? Careful stu- 
dents of Greek civilization do not hesitate to speak 
of the religious value of the Greek drama. When 
the auditor identifies himself with the action on 
the stage Aristotle tells us his feelings of fear and 
pity undergo a kind of purification (catharsis). But 
in baseball the identification has even more of the 
religious quality, since we are absorbed not only in 
the action of the visible actors but more deeply in 
the fate of the mystic unities which we call the con- 
tending cities. To be sure, there may be people 
who go to a baseball game to see some particular 
star, just as there are people who go to church to 
hear a particular minister preach ; but these are 
phenomena in the circumference of the religious life. 



There are also blase persons who do not care who 
wins so long as they can see what they call a good 
game just as there are people who go to mass be- 
cause they admire the vestments or intonations of 
the priest but this only illustrates the pathology of 
the religious life. The truly religious devotee has 
his soul directed to the final outcome; and every 
one of the extraordinarily rich multiplicity of move- 
ments of the baseball game acquires its significance 
because of its bearing on that outcome. Instead of 
purifying only fear and pity, baseball exercises and 
purifies all of our emotions, cultivating 'hope and 
courage when we are behind, resignation when we 
are beaten, fairness for the other team when we are 
ahead, charity for the umpire, and above all the 
zest for combat and conquest. 

When my revered friend and teacher William 
James wrote an essay on the Moral Equivalent of 
War, I suggested to him that baseball already em- 
bodied all the moral value of war, so far as war 
had any moral value. He listened sympathetically 
and was amused, but he did not take me seriously 
enough. All great men have their limitations, and 
William James' were due to the fact that he lived 
in Cambridge, a city which, in spite of the fact that 
it has a population of 100,000 souls (including the 
professors), is not represented in any baseball 
league that can be detected without a microscope. 

Imagine what will happen to the martial spirit 
in Germany if baseball is introduced there if any 
Social Democrat can ask any Herr von Somebody, 
" What's the score? " Suppose that in an exciting 
ninth-inning rally, when the home team ties the score, 
Captain Schmidt punches Captaiff Miller or breaks 
his helmet. Will the latter challenge him to a duel ? 
He will not. Rather will he hug him frenziedly or 
pummel him joyfully at the next moment when the 
winning run comes across the home plate. And af- 
ter the game, what need of further strife? When 
Jones of Philadelphia meets Brown of New York 
there may be a slight touch of condescension on one 
side, or a hidden strain of envy on the other side, but 
they take each other's arm in fraternal fashion, for 
they have settled their differences in an open regu- 
lated combat on a fair field. And if one of us has 
some sore regrets over an unfortunate error which 
lost the game, there is always the consolation that 
we have had our inning, and though we have lost 
there is another game or season coming. And what 
more can a reasonable man expect in this imperfect 
world than an open chance to do his best in a free and 
fair fight ? 

Every religion has its martyrs; and the greatest of 



THE DIAL

all martyrdoms is to make oneself ridiculous and 
to be laughed at by the heathen. But whatever the 
danger, I am ready to urge the claims of interna- 
tional baseball as capable of arousing far more na- 
tional religious fervor than the more monotonous 
game of armaments and war. Those who fear " the 
deadly monotony of a universal reign of peace " can 
convince themselves of the thrilling and exciting 
character of baseball by watching the behavior of 



crowds not only at the games but also at the base- 
ball score-boards miles away. National rivalries and 
aspirations could find their intensest expression in a 
close international pennant race, and yet such rivalry 
would not be incompatible with the establishment of 
the true Church Universal in which all men would 
feel their brotherhood in the Infinite Game.

What is the Good of History? 



OT MUCH GOOD, Professor F. J. Teggart sus- 
pects, as it has hitherto been considered. In his 
modest little volume called The Process of History 
(Yale University Press) he maintains that the 
edifying purpose of historical investigation and writ- 
ing should be to make as clear as may be " how man 
everywhere has come to be as he is." This, his- 
torians have hitherto failed to do. History has been 
until recently a branch of belles lettres which de- 
voted itself to forcing alleged historic facts into the 
unnatural cadre of dramatic presentation. It is 
true that of late many historical contributions have 
made their appearance which have no more claim to 
literary elegance than a treatise on automobile 
clutches or beriberi, but they have none of them 
cast much light on how man everywhere has come 
to be as he is. Mr. Teggart is not so unreasonable 
as to expect anyone to answer so momentous a ques- 
tion succinctly and off-hand. His complaint is that 
historians have really made no attempt to answer it, 
and have not pursued a method by which it could be 
answered. They have been strong in narrative but 
weak in explanation. Ranke's famous aspiration 
to set forth things as they had really been was of 
course indispensable as far as it went; but strangely 
enough it was the geologist and biologist rather 
than the historian that first suggested an essentially 
historical mood in dealing with the past. Mr. 
Teggart is impressed with this fact, and turns to 
the methods of historical science for guidance in 
determining the fundamental factors and processes 
which should engage our attention if we are ever 
to write a real history of how man everywhere 
came to be as he is. 

We all long for light on the murky riddles of 
the present. Could we but once understand in 
even a general and tentative way the manner in 
which man landed in his present complex predica- 
ments we might get at once a frame of mind which 
would enable us more clearly to see the exact na- 
ture of the fix in which we find ourselves and, 
possibly, some suggestions as to how we may hope 



to extricate ourselves from the maze. As our author ' 
remarks at the close of his book: 

It requires no lengthy exposition to demonstrate that the 
ideas which lead to strife, civil or international, are not the 
products of the highest knowledge available, are not the 
verified results of scientific inquiry, but are " opinions " 
about matters which, at the moment, we do not fully under- 
stand. Among modern peoples the most important of these 
opinions are concerned with the ordering of human affairs; 
and in this area all our " settlements " of the problems 
which confront us must continue to be temporary and un- 
certain compromises until we have come to apply the 
method of science to their solution. Science is not a body 
of beliefs and opinions, but is a way or method of dealing 
with problems. . . . Scientific method is the term we 
use for the orderly and scientific effort to find out. Hith- 
erto, the most serious affairs of men have been decided 
upon the basis of argumentation, carried, not infrequently, 
to the utmost limits of destruction and death. It should 
be possible to apply in this domain the method of finding 
out, and it has been my hope to contribute, in however 
tentative a manner, to this end. 

In his first chapter Professor Teggart shows the 
superficial character of the so-called explanations 
that have hitherto been given of the processes of 
history. This superficiality is due to a considerable 
extent to the Europocentric nature of the stories we 
construct and the reckless generalizing and specious 
correlations derived from this highly artificial nar- 
rative. " Precisely what we need to begin with are 
great bodies of historical data , . . relating to 
all human groups without distinction, which have 
not been subjected to the selective activities of trie 
literary artist and the philosopher." 

In his second chapter he reconsiders the reasons 
why peoples wander about the earth and so change 
.their environment and come in contact with other 
peoples. He concludes that these movements are 
not instigated by overpopulation or love of adven- 
ture but generally by a 'diminution of the food sup- 
ply. " Man is prone to remain where he is, to 
fixity in ideas and ways of doing things and only 
through nature's insistent driving has he been 
shaken out of his immobility and set wayfaring on 
the open road." The ordinary conservative tem- 
perament is man's natural heritage; and now as 
ever it fears change even in our dynamic age. The 



1919 



THE DIAL 



59 



conservative rationalizes his primitive apprehen- 
sions by the sophistication that man is a naturally 
restless, disorderly, and anarchic animal who must 
ever be kept in the fetters of dogma, social, political, 
or religious. 

The third chapter., of this little book is a general 
treatment of the process by which tribal society be- 
comes political society; how the creative and am- 
bitious individual leader gets from time to time an 
opportunity of self-assertion. Later history, our 
author remarks, is primarily " the record of the un- 
ceasing efforts of kings to extend what they regard 
as their personal possessions." Our present na- 
tional state with its strong national patriotism can 
easily be traced back to " the institutionalization of 



a situation which arose out of the opportunity for 
personal self-assertion created by the break-up of 
primitive organizations. . . . Thus, through- 
out the past, we are presented with the anomaly of 
men fighting to maintain the institutionalized 
vestiges of the self-assertion of aggressive individ- 
uals on occasions of long-past upheavals." This fact 
if once comprehended might make even a Repub- 
lican senator smile at his own views. 

I fear that Mr. Teggart's book will hardly bring 
its full message to the casual reader, but it can be 
read and reread with advantage by one somewhat 
familiar with the newer conceptions of man and 
his nature.

The Status of the State 



AN IS BORN FREE, yet everywhere he finds 
himself the subject of a state. How did this come 
about? That is the theme of The State and the 
Nation, by Professor Edwards Jenks (Dutton). 
What can make it legitimate? That question Mr. 
Harold J. Laski ably essays to answer. (Author- 
ity in the Mpdern State; Yale University Press.) 

About the origin and the nature of the state 
there has been more perverse theorizing than about 
any other phenomenon except deity. The state has 
meant all things to all men. The chief difficulty 
of the political philosopher has been to reconcile 
its coercive powers with any notion of Its voluntary 
institution, and its general acceptance, by the com- 
munity at large. Is it out of war or peace that the 
state was born? Does it exist by force or by con- 
sent? Those questions appear at the very outset of 
any illuminant discussion: they delimit the re- 
spective positions of Socrates and Thrasymachus 
at the opening of Plato's greatest political dialogue. 
Socrates believes that the state is but an organ of 
community; Thrasymachus holds, on the other 
hand, that the state exists not for the benefit of 
the community but for the advantage of the gov- 
erning classes. He anticipates Nietzsche and 
Treitschke. " In all states, what is just and what 
is advantageous for the established government are 
the same; it hath the power. So that it appears 
to him who reasons rightly that, in all cases, what is 
the advantage of the more powerful, the same is 
just." 

The history of Western Europe confirms the 
prussic realism of Thrasymachus. It is impossible 
to resist Professor Jenks' conclusion that " in the 
formation of the modern state the conspicuous 
causes are the closely related facts of migration and 
conquest." The state does not take its origin in the 



family, the clan, the tribe, the village, the city, or 
the mark. By no conceivable federalization of 
these units could the compulsive military organiza- 
tion we name the state be produced. It is, on the 
contrary, a foreign institution thrust upon the more 
or less peaceful inhabitants of a given territory by 
a group of hunter-warriors, whose sole initial pur- 
pose is simply to live on the land without participat- 
ing in its economic labors. Professor Jenks might 
have used Mr. Laski's very definition: "The sub- 
stance of the state does not vary. It is always a 
territorial society in which there is a distinction 
between government and subjects." 

Now at first the state was little more than its 
government, and territorial compactness was not 
one of its attributes. The crown lands were scat- 
tered. The capital of the state was wherever the 
king happened to be quartered for the night. Just 
before the beginning of those religious wars which 
disrupted the universal polity of the Roman 
Church a process of consolidation resulted in the 
definition of the rigidly bounded national state we 
know today. On this point Professor Jenks is un- 
fortunately silent, for despite the title of his volume 
he does not touch upon the relation of nationality to 
statehood. What took place is nevertheless not ob- 
scure. In order to keep the archives of the state 
accessible and safe a national capital was erected 
and a stable seat of government established. 
Thereafter the capital of the state was the center 
of all civil authority, and instead of merely unify- 
ing and coordinating independent local functions 
the state got more and more into the habit of 
formulating its policies without respect to the in- 
terests of the discrete and increasingly powerless 
provincial groups in the hinterland. 

It is a mistake to think that the early military 



6o

state was all-powerful. Its position was too pre- 
carious for that. What made the state finally sov- 
ereign in authority was the breakup of the feudal sys- 
tem, the collapse of town econonw, and the rise of the 
concept of nationality, coincident with the develop- 
ment of a cpmmon native language. The state 
capital became the center of art, science, and litera- 
ture. The culture of the capital succeeded in pass- 
ing itself off on the provinces as the one authentic 
and indisputable " national " culture. The bounda- 
ries of the state in Western Europe were made 
roughly coincident with the limits of a single 
language. Within those boundaries, after the pat- 
tern set in the national capital, the life of the na- 
tion became encysted. The Defense of the Realm 
became the chief end of statesmanship. Internally 
it meant the suppression of all national, religious, 
and civic groups which refused to acknowledge the 
overwhelming supremacy and moral authority of 
the state. Externally it meant the challenging of 
all foreign governments which threatened to contend 
for the possession of 'the vested interests and privi- 
leges which the state preserved for those who ruled 
within. 

In essence, this is the sum and substance of the 
institution which claims the adherence, in war and 
peace, of every human being born within its terri- 
tory. As Professor Jenks bravely admits "the 
famous apothegm of Treitschke ' The State is 
Power ' is absolutely borne out by the facts of his- 
tory; it is only in their monstrous and illogical de- 
duction from this truth that Treitschke and his fol- 
lowers have erred. Their doctrine in brief was: 
' The state is power ; therefore fall down and wor- 
ship it !' The true doctrine is : ' The state is 
power; therefore, while recognizing its value, be- 
ware how you allow it to master you.' " The 
danger is not lessened, as we learned in the drastic 
experiment of the late war, by the paltry checks 
and balances of a so-called democratic government. 
Bismarck and Burleson dedicated their lives to the 
same political deity. 

" It is," as Mr. Laski says, " with the sovereign 
state that we are today confronted. For its funda- 
mental agents, that is to say, there is claimed a 
power from which no appeal is to be made. The 
attributes of sovereignty have been admirably 
described by Paley. Its power ' may be termed 
absolute, omnipotent, uncontrollable, arbitrary, 
despotic, and is alike so in all countries.' " These 
are pretentious claims, and Mr. Laski calls to his 
aid all the resources of indefatigable scholarship 
and delicate philosophic analysis to demolish them. 
Happily he does not find it more difficult in dis- 
cussing contemporary fact, than Professor Jenks does 
in treating historic fact, to show that these claims 



are, when checked up by sociological realities, 
ridiculously inflated. The omnipotent powers of 
the state are perhaps good '' for duration of war " 
because it is in warfare that the peculiar functions 
of the state are exercised without internal rivalry. 
But as soon as the herd instinct ceases to evoke the 
attitude so necessary to group conflict, the united 
front, we find that the sovereignty of the state is 
subject to limitation as a result of the pressure of 
custom, law, and current moral judgment. Above 
all, perhaps, because man is a city-building animal, 
and his civic needs are not met by the lean satis- 
factions of his life as the member of a political 
state. " Whatever the requirements of legal theory 
no man surrenders his whole being to the 
state. . . . Government dare not range over 
the whole area of human life." 

Now if the political theorist commits the mistake 
of thinking that the individual and the state are 
the only entities that need be considered there are 
really only one of two loyalties possible for him. 
He may follow the Hegelian method and deny the 
individual, or he may take the Spencerian lead and 
deny the state. But the Spencerian effort to make 
the state responsible by making it impotent was 
based upon an incomplete sociological analysis, 
which neglected the fundamental need of all de- 
veloped individuals for participation in some form 
of associative life. Historically the state has not 
become weakened by the emphasis on the isolated 
individual: it actually has tended to take over 
functions which would otherwise be in the hands 
of vigorous voluntary associations. The belief in 
this process of substitution is the characteristic of 
state socialism. But obviously the more functions 
that the state absorbs the more compulsive and 
irresistible will be its authority. " To make the 
state omnicompetent," as Mr. Laski incisively 
points out, "is to leave it at the mercy of any group 
that is powerful enough to exploit it. ... 
The only way out of such an impasse is the neutral- 
ization of the state; and it cannot be neutralized 
save by the division of power that is today con- 
centrated in its hands." This, of course, is to do 
away with the assumed priority of the state's in- 
terests and affairs. But that priority it based upon 
an illicit identification of the multitudinous wills 
of the community with the particular will of the 
government of the state. Because the province of 
the state is as wide as its territories its claim to ex- 
ercise control over every department of civil life 
within that area is by no means substantiated. It 
is not the amount of territory ir covers, but the 
number of interests it subsumes, that matters to the 
citizen. The state is not, and must never be per- 
mitted to become, the only group organization open 



THE DIAL

to the individual. The state is, and must remain, 
but one association among many. Nor is the state 
by itself, after all, the most powerful organization. 
The state becomes formidable only when it is able to 
attract the allegiance of various corporations, com- 
munities, and associations that coexist with it, and 
that are (despite the arrant legal fiction of incor- 
poration) coordinate with the state and independent 
of it for their existence. Without the good will 
of these groups the state is destitute of authority; 
without their active cooperation it is impotent. 

Now the constitution of the modern state does 
not represent its real relation to the body politic. 
It is, we are all agreed, a territorial society in 
which representation in the legislature is appor- 
tioned on the basis of an arbitrary division of the 
country into " states," provinces, cantons, coun- 
ties, districts, or departments. In theory the repre- 
sentative goes to the national capital on behalf of 
his locality, and some observers are so innocent as 
to believe that " representation by locality " is re- 
sponsible for the notorious lapses and futilities of 
modern republican government. These observers 
advocate representation by classes and interests. As 
a matter of fact there has never been, since the 
close of the Middle Ages, any other kind of organ- 
ization. A member of Congress does not vote as 
the member of a community: he represents the 
political party whose control of the state the major- 
ity of his constituents has assented to: and as such 
he stands for a certain set of diffused group inter- 
ests centered about let us say a protective tariff, 
or the collective ownership of public utilities. If 
the interests of localities had genuinely been dom- 
inant the state and federal governments in the 
United States would not have increased so greatly 
in power and prestige. Political platforms, how- 
ever, are hardly under the surveillance of the local 
members of the parties. Hence the interests that 
they have furthered have been those advocated, 
not by particular cities or regions, but by active 
economic minorities. If we have not had a uni- 
versal representation by interests it is only because 
we have permitted the substitute of representation 
by apathies. 

Granting that the state can function only by 
the advice and consent of these corporate groups 
the important problem for discussion is how the 
groups themselves are to be constituted. The ques- 
tion is not, as Mr. H. J. Mackinder supposes in 
his Democratic Ideals and Realities (Holt) Inter- 
ests versus Localities; it is to what extent locali- 
ties will figure in the development and formula- 
tion of interests. That the groups which guide the 
state must be made responsible goes without say- 
ing. But how are the purposes of these groups to 



be formulated; how are their wills to be carried 
out? At the final stage many political thinkers 
envisage a National Congress composed of indus- 
trial and professional associations with a representa- 
tion proportionate to their respective memberships. 
This they denominate a producer's parliament, and 
the English theorists would counterbalance it with 
a consumer's parliament in which representatives 
would be drawn not from trades but from 
geographic areas. If representation by locality, 
however, be the fiction we have asserted, this bi- 
cameral conception is unworkable; for it would 
represent a cleavage between economic groups func- 
tioning through occupational associations and eco- 
nomic groups functioning through political asso- 
ciations, and in case of conflict there could be no 
other kind of agreement than that enforced by 
superior physical power. 

Developments within the trade-union movement 
during the last half decade show that there is still 
a third possibility. In many cases the workers have 
found that organization by highly centralized na- 
tional unions has the same defect that organization 
by centralized national states is guilty of it ignores 
regional needs, peculiarities, and differences, and 
carries controlling power too far away from the 
those most concerned in its immediate application. 
The shop steward in England, the shop commit- 
tee in America, and the factory Soviet in Hungary 
and Russia suggest that economic interests them- 
selves must be organized primarily on a local basis. 
The federation of these local units within a single 
city or region; and the federation of regional labor 
associations into national or transnational bodies 
seem the more desirable methods of organization. 
This suggests plainly a reconciliation of the in- 
dividual's interests as a worker and as a citizen, 
as the member of an industrial and the member of 
a political society. Both current theories leave these 
functions unintegrated : the politician would have 
the individual forget his class interests; the interna- 
tional trades-union executive would have him ignore 
his place interests. Ultimately, the security against 
arbitrary oppression by producers and consumers, 
drawn up in battle array, lies in the possibility of 
establishing this common basis for both of them. 
-The city-region itself would function in this federal 
scheme as but a coeval economic association of con- 
sumers not as a superior, governmental institution. 
Thus the state would eventually be neutralized it 
would amount to little more than a highly respected 
Bureau of Standards. ' That is a far cry from the 
position it pretends to hold at present. But it may 
not in point of time be a distant one.

Two Iconoclasts: Veblen and Vanderlip 
F 



OR SOME YEARS REPUTABLE scientists have been 
free to investigate such problems as the nature of 
the atom and the possibility of producing frogs with 
only one parent without fear of the displeasure of 
the Grand Lama of Thibet or the condemnation of 
the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolu- 
tion. Darwin's battle is well won, and when the 
priesthood of science takes issue with the older orders 
it is not science that has to give way. But the dis- 
passionate search for truth in the complicated field 
of human relations has not yet attained the same 
standing; there is still a holy of holies into which 
only a few students have entered, and then at their 
peril. To weigh a star is admirable; to weigh an 
institution exposes one to the slings and arrows of 
an outraged press and an outworn scholasticism. It 
is for this reason, no doubt, that the words of 
America's foremost economist carry less weight with 
the readers, let us say of the New York Tribune 
or the North American Review, than do those of 
Nicholas Murray Butler and Elihu Root. In a 
less dangerous field of inquiry work comparable 
with that of Thorstein Veblen would win recog- 
nition as the beginning of an important new school. 
It is only because most of us are too deeply a part 
of our own institutions to be able to consider them 
scientifically that the exquisite irony of The Theory 
of the Leisure Class, the penetrating analysis of 
The Theory of Business Enterprise, and the dazzling 
conceptions which underlie the somewhat formid- 
able Instinct of Workmanship have not won Mr. 
Veblen a formal place in the front rank of con- 
temporary thinkers and prophets. The so-called 
difficulty of Veblen's style has nothing to do with 
the scant recognition that the Brahmins have ac- 
corded him. He is as easy to read as any man 
with as much to say. 

A few years ago it seemed that such a diagnosis 
of human affairs as that in The Theory of the 
Leisure Class would have as little chance of alter- 
ing the world for the better as the satires of Swift 
and Juvenal had of changing human nature. But 
our age has become dynamic. The world is fluid. 
The tides of proletarian revolution surge one way, 
the currents of reaction the other. The gap be- 
tween the thinker and the doer has narrowed; the 
idle speculation of yesterday is the political issue 
of today and tomorrow. Mr. Veblen's latest con- 
tribution, The Vested Interests and the State of 
the Industrial Arts (Huebsch), although it still 
belongs in the field of inquiry rather than of prop- 
aganda, would be the well-worn handbook of 



Plato's philosopher statesman, were there such a 
one in power. 

" The aim of these papers," the author explains 
in a brief preface, " is to show how, and, as far 
as may be, why a discrepancy has arisen in the 
course of time between those accepted principles 
of law and custom that underlie business enter- 
prise and the businesslike management of industry, 
on the one hand, and the material conditions which 
have now been engendered by that new order of 
industry that took its rise in the late eighteenth cen- 
tury, on the other hand; together with some spec- 
ulations on the civil and political difficulties set 
afoot by this discrepancy between business and in- 
dustry." The argument may be roughly indicated 
for DIAL readers not yet familiar with it. The 
modern theories of society took shape at the close 
of the period which connected the decay of feu- 
dalism with the beginning of machine industry. 
There is always a perceptible lag between " law 
and custom " on the one hand and everyday 
"knowledge and belief" on the other;. the former 
never quite catch up, and are never quite reconciled 
with the demonstrable facts of the workday en- 
vironment. In a period of rapid change there is a 
greater discrepancy than in static periods, but there 
is always a discrepancy. The more rapid the 
mechanical changes in the ways of living the 
greater the strain that is put upon law and custom. 
The last great restatement of accepted common- 
places was made in the generations following the 
Protestant Reformation. It reached its climax in 
the formulations of Adam Smith, who summarized 
a set of working principles well adapted to a so- 
ciety still largely in the handicraft stage. The 
French and American revolutions resulted in the 
stabilization of a handicraft economy and moral- 
ity, just as handicraft was about to give way, by 
a leap more abrupt than any analogous one in his- 
tory, to a totally different scheme of production. 
" The modern point of view,," thus petrified, " is 
now some one hundred and fifty years old. 
There are two main counts included in this mod- 
ern eighteenth century plan, which appear unre- 
mittingly to make for discomfort and dissension un- 
der the conditions offered by the New Order of 
things: National ambition and the Vested 
Rights of Ownership. . . . Both of these im- 
memorially modern rights of man have come to 
yield a net return of hardship and ill-will for all 
those peoples who have bound up their fortunes 
with that kind of enterprise." 



1919 



THE DIAL 



Under the new order " the first requisite of ordi- 
nary productive industry is no longer the workman 
and his manual skill, but rather the mechanical 
equipment and the standardized processes in which 
the mechanical equipment is engaged. And this 
latterday industrial equipment and process embodies 
not the manual skill, dexterity, and judgment of the 
individual workman, but rather the accumulated 
technological wisdom of the community." It fol- 
lows that any system of rewards based upon the 
assumption of exceptional individual " skill, dexter- 
ity, and judgment " is bound to clash more or less 
with the facts, and it is the nature of this clash 
to yield what Veblen calls " free income " to in- 
dividuals who are religiously supposed to have 
exercised the virtues of self-help in a socially ben- 
eficial way roughly proportional to their rewards, 
but who actually stand rather in the position of ob- 
structors of traffic. Free income is pleasantly 
spoken of in the business world as " intangible as- 
sets," and is commonly " derived from advantages of 
salesmanship rather than from productive work." 
Now, salesmanship patently aims to sell at a prof- 
itable price, and it is salesmanship that determines 
what the rate and quantity of production shall be. 
Commonly the rate is far below what the mechan- 
ical equipment would allow. During the late war, 
Veblen estimates, the American mechanical equip- 
ment was operated at something like fifty per cent 
of its technically possible output. " The habitual 
net production is fairly to be rated at something 
like one-fourth of the industrial community's pro- 
ductive capacity ; presumably under that figure 
rather than over." From this reduced product 
" special privilege " takes its due share and it re- 
tains its grip on that share by an habitual, though 
quite lawful and even blameless, restriction upon 
output. For a concrete illustration of the author's 
point we have only to observe the current housing 
shortage, which has been brought about by the re- 
fusal of business men to build houses ^ that is, by 
businesslike sabotage) until a sufficient amount of 
"free income " was assured. Human needs can cut 
no figure in these calculations. 

Akin to the rights and perquisites of business 
men in the national field are those of nations in 
the international field, and both have the practical 
effect of preventing the full use of the gigantic pro- 
ductive apparatus and the more important body 
of technological skill and knowledge that perpet- 
ually re-creates it which have developed since 
those rights and perquisites were guaranteed. Inso- 
far as the league of nations turns out to be a league 
of governments and not of peoples it sanctions and 
encourages this vast system of international sabot- 



age. The net profit of competitive nationalism has 
ceased to be apparent, but there remains at least 
a " psychic income " which the conferees at Paris 
were extremely solicitous to protect. This may 
content the dominating classes; as far as the wel- 
fare of the common man goes " the most beneficent 
change that can conceivably overtake any national 
establishment would be to let it fall into ' innocuous 
desuetude.' " 

There are some points in this explanation upon 
which Lenin and Veblen might shake hands, others 
concerning which they would necessarily disagree. 
As to probabilities in this country Veblen is no 
alarmist or, as some would say, no undue optimist. 
He sees no rapid discrediting of the old laws and 
customs in America, except among the compara- 
tively few and outcast I.W.W., and perhaps among 
the members of the Non-Partisan League. The 
American Federation of Labor and the majority of 
the farmers, though hard-pressed, are still uncor 
rupted. Yet, as he has pointed out in a more re- 
cent discussion published in THE DIAL, there is 
already on foot a project for a coalition between 
the industrial workers on the one hand and the en- 
gineers and production managers on the other which 
may, peaceably and without social disruption, come 
to the same thing. 

If Mr. Veblen escapes the clutches of the sev- 
eral leagues and committees which are now engaged 
in eliminating Bolshevism from the United States 
he will be accused of the slightly less heinous crime 
of preaching a variety of Socialism. In fact, he 
is as far from the dogmatism of Lenin or Marx as 
he is from that of Adam Smith or J. S. Mill. He 
is an observer, not a Utopian. To refute him his 
critics will be compeled to examine into certain 
neglected aspects of current production and pro- 
ductivity, and if economic discussion takes the trend 
he has indicated he will, whatever the outcome of 
the controversy, have done a distinguished service. 

As applied to the present condition of Europe 
the Veblen method would consist in a complete 
rejection of the forms and pretenses of statesman- 
ship and diplomacy and the giving of exclusive at- 
tention to the " state of the industrial arts." It is 
such an examination as this that Frank Vanderlip 
(perhaps the last well-known man in the United 
States to be suspected of dangerous radicalism) has 
made, without any doctrinal foresight, in the little 
volume which he calls What Happened to Europe 
(Macmillan). Before going abroad Mr. Vander- 
lip seems to have accepted without a qualm the 
conventional view of the war and of its effect upon 
Europe. He knew as much about it as a leading 
banker could know. But (or therefore) he found, 



THE DIAL 



July 26 



as he tells us, that he knew " practically nothing." 
On the continent he found industry prostrate, in 
the so-called victor nations as well as in those that 
were defeated. He became convinced, as the peace 
conferees unhappily seem not to have been, that 
" there will be security nowhere so long as there 
are, here and there, plague centers in which idle- 
ness, lack of production, disorganized transporta- 
tion, want, and hunger make a breeding ground for 
the Bolshevik microbe." He perceived that an in- 
crease in national magnificence is quite consistent 
with a decline in the welfare of the common man: 
" The differential that England has had in the last 
generation, compared with America, has been the 
differential of a wage scale that averaged lower 
than the point at which the physical efficiency of 
labor could be maintained." He saw that " the 
disorganization of industry, of transportation, and 
of production has so thrown out of balance the in- 
tricate machinery of civilization that there is safety 
nowhere." Again and again he comes back to his 
heresy that " Europe must be treated as a unit." 
Much has been made of Mr. Vanderlip's project 
for extending vast, long-time credits to Europe. It 
is essentially a sanitary measure. He explains: 

I believe the stability of the present order of society, the 
maintenance of a society based upon the principle of prop- 
erty rights, is bound up with the way this problem is 
worked out in Europe. We cannot stand a world apart in 
its solution. Indeed, we cannot stand a world apart in any 
sense. No matter how self-sufficient we may believe our- 
selves to be, no matter how unlimited are the resources of 
natural wealth within us, we are inevitably part o'f what 
is coming to be a-very small world, a world in which ideas 
travel with a freedom and rapidity that must force us to 
become internationalists in our views and must govern us 
by international considerations, whatever may be our nat- 
ural tendencies of Chauvinism, or our disposition toward 
an insular isolation and security. 

With the same sense of the necessity of prevent- 
ing some dire disaster, roughly described as Bol- 
shevism, Mr. Vanderlip admits the necessity of con- 
ceding to labor a share in the control of industry. 
In the past this has generally meant, in the minds 
of men subject to such an environment as that of 
Mr. Vanderlip, just such a modified feudalism as 
that set up (apparently with the best of intentions) 
by young Mr. Rockefeller in Colorado. The Rock- 
efeller scheme is perhaps as near to economic democ- 
racy as the parliaments of the first three English 
Edwards were to representative government in 
twentieth century England. It may be a step for- 
ward, but it is nothing that need keep even an old- 
fashioned banker awake of nights. But Mr. Van- 
derlip seems convinced that the workers demand 
and must have some real power, and he sees that 
this is, in all countries, of more importance than 
increased wages or shortened working days. Thus: 



It seems to me that the most important thing for Ameri- 
can employers to grasp is the significance attached by 
workingmen to bettering their social status in industry. At 
home I never miss an opportunity to gain enlightenment on 
the workmen's point of view, and I have been increasingly 
impressed with their desire for a larger voice in manage- 
ment. They do not want a voice either in the manage- 
ment or the responsibility of the business office, but they 
do want more to say about the immediate industrial con- 
ditions in which they work. I am thoroughly convinced 
that that aspiration is now world-wide and that America 
will feel the demand as strongly as it is now being felt in 
Europe. I believe it is a demand that American employers 
should heed, and that it should be met not merely by forced 
and grudging concessions, but rather from the point of 
view which is now held by many English employers. It is 
declared that what the men want is to be treated as intelli- 
gent participators in industry, to be consulted and to have 
things explained to them. It is a reasonable and logical 
claim, and employers themselves believe they will have to 
concede it. 

Here and in other passages Mr. Vanderlip draws 
a distinct line between the control of production 
and the control of distribution. In the latter he 
does not seem to think the majority of the workers 
demand, or are qualified, to exercise any degree of 
control. If labor in this country and abroad at- 
tained all that Mr. Vanderlip at present wants to 
offer them the productive machinery would still be 
throttled down or speeded up. by the necessities of 
the market. There would be a general improvement 
in the condition of labor and a somewhat more than 
corresponding increase in production, but the right 
of the owners of the industrial equipment and the 
natural resources -to regulate the functions of pro- 
duction of their own interest, and against the pub- 
lic interest, would be in nowise impaired. But 
the distance that Mr. Vanderlip has covered is more 
remarkable than the distance that, if he is to become 
perfectly logical, he has yet to travel. He has 
left definitely behind him the last vestiges of the 
theory that the labor bargain is a free contract be- 
tween individuals. He has stepped from the eigh- 
teenth century, if not into the twentieth, at least 
far into the nineteenth. The chief defect of his 
policy is, in fact, that he does not see all its im- 
plications. For one may be sure that great labor 
organizations which have had an influential voice 
in the making of their product will not patiently, 
and out of a respect for the boundaries between 
shop and market, see their hard work undone by a 
bungling system of distribution. Mr. Vanderlip's 
radicalism is more thoroughgoing than he himself 
may realize. Without disowning competitive na- 
tionalism or self-help indeed, reaffirming them 
he proposes to take some of the steps to save them 
that Mr. Veblen might take in the dry-eyed assur- 
ance that they are already lost.

great league of nations already exists. It is called 
the British Empire. By the present covenant it is 
proposed that the United States should guarantee 
by force of arms and control of materials the terri- 
torial arrangements designated in the Peace Treaty. 
In Europe itself these arrangements define the rela-

British Empire they define the relation of a domi- 
nant master-state to a broad and increasingly dis-

the British Empire, in addition to that of the 
inchoate states of Europe. In so far as the British 
Empire is made up of self-governing dominions, the 
condition laid down in Article X need occasion no 
alarm. A federal union of equals is internally 
cohesive. But the British Empire contains subject 
states, subject colonies, and mandatories terri- 
tories which have been taken over for the purposes 
of exploitation. Above a million square miles have 
been added since the beginning of the w^ar by 
" right " of might, both openly and under the guise 
of mandatories; and if the present treaty is signed 
and the Covenant allowed to pass without amend- 
ment this forcible appropriation (that is, pillage) 
will go by without protest. If we connive at this 
we are an accessory after the fact. The currency 
system might as well be founded on counterfeiting 
as a League of Nations upon the rights of military 
conquest. We are thus asked to guarantee by force 
an arrangement to which we cannot with honor 
give our consent. Now to guarantee the subjection 
of the Empire's foreign population will carry the 
United States one step further away from her demo- 
cratic professions and anti-imperialist traditions. 
Consider the case of Ireland. Suppose a Sinn Fein 
government firmly entrenched and the present Brit- 
ish army of occupation cut to pieces, and suppose 
that the British government appealed to the Coun- 
cil of Ten for aid on the ground that its territorial 
integrity was menaced. Would the United States 
assent to the embargo of Ireland? Could it with- 
hold its assent under Article X? It is possible that 
the Irish question will be amicably settled,-and this 
particular dilemma may not crop up, but it is an ex- 
ample of what may very well happen in the Empire's 
relations with Egypt, India, and the Near East 
territories the Empire is bent upon politely exploit- 
ing. Great Britain has no moral claim to any of 
these territories. They were added by military con- 



quest and have been administered by an unsym- 
pathetic bureaucracy for the benefit of home in- 
vestors. These are no grounds for denying the 
right of self-determination to the underlying 
populations. To guarantee the British ascendancy 
in foreign lands is to establish the supremacy of the 
investing classes in Great Britain at the expense 
of political and industrial democracy. Our own 
history should teach us the dangers of this policy. 
The mercantile system which alienated the Amer- 
ican Colonies from Great Britain was based upon a 
discrimination between colonial and imperial inter- 
ests, a discrimination which sought to maintain 
permanently the economic inferiority of America 
for the benefit of the ruling classes at home. Great 
Britain's relations with China and India today fol- 
low the lines of this earlier pattern. If we under- 
write the present empire we renounce the very basis 
and authority of our own independence. We per- 
petuate a situation we ourselves found insupport- 
able. So long as labor has not captured the British 
state anything that adds to the power of the Empire 
adds to the strength and prestige of the ruling 
classes. The guarantees established by the Covenant 
sanction their continued supremacy. If this were 
still the America of Franklin, Jefferson, and Lin- 
coln we should not substantiate the claims of Brit- 
ish imperialism, inflated as they are by the seizure 
of Egypt and the establishment of mandatories. 
The present treaty and covenant embody those 
claims. Therefore, in the interest of internal, 
democracy, and international morality, these docu- 
ments, as they stand, must be rejected. The United 
States can exist without the British Empire. In the 
present state of the Empire its existence must be 
precarious without the aid of the United States. 
That is the ultimate reason for refusing our sanc- 
tion. 



IKE PEACE TREATY HAVING BEEN SIGNED, 

metropolitan newspapers are asking their readers to 
marvel at the fact that some fourteen separate wars 
are still raging on the continent of Europe. The 
most marvelous thing about this business is that the 
journalistic mind can break one situation into so 
many artificially separated items. There is under 
way in Europe one revolution of the familiar 
political sort that of Ireland against Great Britain. 
Two territorial wars are likewise in progress be- 
tween Jugoslavia and Austria, and Poland and 



66 



July 26 



Ukrania. The other dozen wars are one the 
rebellion of the proletariat against the proper- 
tariat. Here the forces of the Old Order fall into 
four groups. From Archangel to the Baltic shore 
and inland again to Galicia stretches the crescent of 
the new Eastern front, where British and German 
troops are making Russia safe for the operation of 
a half-dozen armies North Russian, Finnish, Es- 
thonian, Livonian, Lithuanian, Polish now in the 
field against the Soviet Republic. Denikin in the 
South and Kolchak in the East are cutting off Old 
Russia from outlets won in the days of Peter the 
Great and Catherine the Insatiable. To the West, 
lesser armies of Roumanians and Czechs are clus- 
tering around another victim Soviet Hungary. 
And everywhere in Siberia and Galicia, on the 
White Sea and the Black are the uniforms of 
those organizers of new propertarian armies, the 
officers of Britain and France. In this fashion, in 
one great astounding war, there is exhibited the in- 
ternational unity of thought and action that has 
given birth to the League of Corporations. 



As LABOR IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE RESORTS 

to industrial action to effect political ends, it seems 
as though the world might discover, in the years 
ahead, where and how, in the interest of a progres- 
sive civilization, political action can be put to use. 
While political government has served as a tool for 
the accomplishment of ends which are distinctly 
finite, it has figured traditionally among common 
people as a sacrosanct institution. They have been 
permitted in the most advanced communities to ap- 
proach the institution at regular, stated, or con- 
venient intervals with a paper offering which they 
might drop on the altar. This act of the common 
people constituted a state of affairs called democ- 
racy. Having just waged a war for the continua- 
tion of this happy state, we are naturally shocked to 
find that the common people of Europe propose to 
regard the political machinery at the knocked-down 
valuation to which it has been reduced. There are 
methods of handling this machinery more realistic 
than the ballot, and some of these methods are open 
to the common as well as the uncommon man. All 
may play the game of hold-up in one way or another. 
The workers have been loth to use their power, but 
they have discovered as a result of the war that if 
their participation in the affairs of common life is to 
be more than a myth they must accept the terms 
which others have set up. The game is crude, but 
the crudity did not become apparent until it threat- 
ened to become common. As a matter of fact as 
labor succeeds in opening up the game for common 
use and advertising the crudities of political methods 
there will be a chance, for the first time in the his- 
tory of political government, to discover how far 
political machinery can serve political, that is com- 
mon, interests. 



WEEKS PASS AND THE CASE OF KOLCHAK v. THE 
Soviets drags on interminably. John A. Embry, 
sometime United States consul at Omsk, reports 
wholesale killing in the region where the White 
Terror and the Red overlap killing for which the 
Bolsheviki are responsible, Mr. Embry says (New 
York Times, July i). Upon being questioned, 
the witness states that he now represents a firm of 
exporters and importers with headquarters at the 
capital of the Kolchak Government ! Comes then 
one Joshua Rosett, sent into Siberia by the 
Committee on Public Information, a branch of 
our government not yet suspected of pro-Bolshe- 
vist tendencies. This witness testifies that Kol- 
chak broke up the Zemstvo government in Si- 
beria, suppressed free speech and free press, and 
" exiled or murdered every member of the Rus- 
sian Constituent Assembly upon whom he could lay 
his hands" (New Republic, July 9); the Admi- 
ral's method of dealing individually with the 
members of the Assembly will appear very in- 
genious when it is remembered that the majority 
of these persons are now of the Bolshevist 
persuasion. In a confidential dispatch from 
the Far East, Arthur Bullard, another rep- 
resentative of Mr. Creel's Committee, says that 
" allied support of Kolchak's experiment in re- 
action is a feature regrettable" (The Nation, 
July 19). Thus the volume of testimony grows; 
spectators come and go, wondering casually what 
the final outcome will be, blind to the fact 
that those who sit in high places have already 
given a verdict and that the executions are in 
progress. Russia asks for bread and receives 
whiffs of grapeshot. Typhus and cholera are rag- 
ing, bu"t medical supplies are denied and material ol 
this sort shipped by the Danish Red Cross is turned 
back by the Allied forces. The formalities of a 
trial are superfluous when starvation and the plague 
are already guiding the hand of " justice " to the 
throat of the Russian people. 



1 HE RECENT STATEMENT OF OUR NEW UNDER 

Secretary of State to the effect that the Soviet 
Government of Russia could scarcely expect recog- 
nition unless it declared itself willing to pay its 
foreign debts, or rather to recognize as its own 
debts incurred by the former Czaristic and Keren- 
sky regimes, is significant, and not altogether self- 
explanatory which debts would the Under Secre- 
tary have the Russians recognize? Is he speaking 
for his own country alone, or is it intended to throw 
the American Government's influence behind the 
claims of France and England as well? In Article 
21 of Annex II of the recently published treaty 
between Poland and the Allied and Associated 
Powers " Poland agrees to assume responsibility 
for such proportion of the Russian public debt and 
other Russian public liabilities of any kind as may 



1919

be assigned to her under a special convention be- 
tween the principal allied and associated powers on 
the one hand and Poland on the other, to be pre- 
pared by a commission appointed by the above 
states.." This assignation, it may be assumed, will 
be based on the estimated extent to which present 
Polish territory benefited by the application of the 
proceeds of foreign loans. To this extent at least 
the Soviet Government will be absolved from de- 
livering the sum that Poland can be induced to as- 
sume. How much of the funds raised in the 
United States by the pre-Soviet Russian Govern- 
ments were actually turned over to these Govern- 
ments, and how mych liability can be justly allotted 
to the present Russian Government when the former 
Russian Governments (or their accredited repre- 
sentatives when the Governments themselves ceased 
to exist) not only refused to turn over public funds 
in their possession, but obviously appropriated them 
for their own use even to the extent of financing 
counter revolution and foreign intervention against 
the de facto Russian Government? It would seem 
clear from the amount of Russian loans floated in 
this country and the supplies sent from here to Rus- 
sia that American citizens indeed hold some just 
claims against the Russian state, or the Russian 
people under whatever government it may be, for 
value received. Have these claims been formulated 
by their holders, examined by the State Department, 
communicated to the Soviet Government and been 
disavowed by it ? The public is entitled to these facts, 
if they exist, since it is only on the basis of facts, 
authoritative and convincing, that it can come to any 
just conclusions. Are we to settle our own difficul- 
ties with Russia according to our own straightfor- 
ward, single-handed American manner, or is our 
State Department to maintain its obdurate attitude 
toward that struggling people till the Entente 
Powers have carved out satisfactorily extensive 
pledges in timber and oil of an indebtedness which 
their diplomacy in Russia had precluded them from 
realizing by fair and peaceful means? It depends, 
first, upon how much time it will take the savage 
tribes that fringe the territory of Russia, backed by 
Entente and Japanese troops and supplies, to battle 
their way to Moscow and stamp out Bolshevism in a 
country where 80 to 90 per cent of the population 
appears to have accepted its formulas; second, upon 
the lease of life extended by the popular parties of 
England, France, and Italy to their present impe- 
rialistic governments. Finally it depends upon the 
ability of these imperialistic governments and their 
American agents and friends to dyke up with their 
one-sided atrocity propaganda, the rising tide of pro- 
test of the American people at our Government's 
smug attitude toward starving and blockaded Rus- 
sia. The success of Kolchak is dubious; the tenure 
of the European governments is infirm. It is there- 
fore on the corruption of American opinion that 
counter-revolutionary propaganda is centered. 



UNLESS UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION FOR MILITARY 
training is got under way in a hurry, we shall be 
obliged to use a volunteer army in our potential 
war with Mexico. Such being the case, it may be 
wise to begin at once to gather material for the 
recruiting posters. Much data relative to the 
causes of the War, now in free circulation, may 
otherwise be unavailable when we have in hand the 
business of touching the " hearts and minds " of 
men of military age. Let it be set down then that 
irregularities in Russia have done much to curtail 
Europe's supply of oil. Concurrently with the 
Peace Conference there was held in Paris an in- 
formal gathering of those gentlemen who control as 
much of the world's oil supply as has not been cut 
off by the unreasonable Bolsheviki. Nothing hap- 
pened. Until presently there appeared a Council of 
Twenty financiers purely informal organized to 
look after investments in Mexico, where extinc- 
tion of private property in oil wells is threatened. 
Since that time events have moved with gather- 
ing speed. Felix Diaz is conducting a revo- 
lution in behalf of law and order and property 
rights. Villa, ion a summer^ swing around the 
circle, has given the United States the opportunity 
to commit what Carranza might choose to con- 
sider an act of war against Mexico. Carranzist 
promises to let the oil kings go their way in Mexico 
have alternated with stories of drilling stopped by 
force of arms, and of Americans killed by ruffians 
rather less often than in our own South. The 
whole business has finally got into such a muddled 
state that the New York Times has hired an ex- 
consul of ours to run up a trial balance and see 
just how much money each of the powers now has 
tied up in Mexico. The totals are approximately: 
America $870,000,000; Great Britain $670,000,- 
ooo; France $285,000,000; Germany $75,000,000 
(very menacing). Now in order that there shall be 
no departure from the spirit of true international- 
ism, the war against Mexico should not be con- 
ducted by any one nation for a selfish purpose, but 
by the League of Corporations, functioning 
through the United States army for convenience's 
sake. When all these facts are widely published 
and it is made clear that the object of that war is 
to be the purely humanitarian one of conserving 
private property, there will be no end of young men 
eager to be buried near the oil wells. 

EXPERIENCE HAS OF LATE MADE IT INCREASINGLY 

easy for Americans to make the logical leap from 
the beginning of a project of repression to its con- 
clusion. By consequence the news that the Rand 
School had been raided was accepted in some quar- 
ters as an announcement that the institution had 
been closed. But for once force has not kept pace 
with inference. While lawyers deliberate the means 
of suppression, the work of the School proceeds.

Casual Comment 

How OFTEN IN THE COURSE OF INDIVIDUAL AND 

collective history do love of war, love of power, love 
of woman, or of the several arts draw rich curtains 
of emotion between the intellect of man and those 
flat realities of life that seem so to cry out for study 
and appraisement! How much will a man endure 
from outrageous fortune if only his verses have oc- 
casional acceptance, or his lady smile once in a moon ! 
For Baudelaire, one kind or another of inebriety is a 
necessity to hide from men the bare bones of truth, 
unendurable to the eye. Just now, when the prom- 
ises of religion are becoming daily less effective as 
palliatives for unendurable conditions, certain people 
who accept a full measure of religious comfort 
being for the most part little in need of it are en- 
gaged in a very energetic campaign to remove out 
of existence a cherished comforter which has 
helped for a long time to hold people of another sort 
in quietude. For the most part the church pegple 
do not want to see things generally upset, and yet 
here they are, depriving the workingman of his beer ! 
Perhaps they do not understand the stabilizing effect 
of beer upon society, in which case Mr. Gompers 
of the American Federation of Labor will willingly 
supply the necessary data. The wobblies of the 
I.W.W. would also be willing to testify, though 
unlike Mr. Gompers they have no vested interest 
in stability. It is even said that they accuse Mr. 
Gompers of bad faith, insisting that for the failing 
consolation of

Right here. 

WHEN AMERICA WAS STILL A SPECTATOR OF THE 
European conflict, our theater audiences had stomach 
for the realities of the war. In those days we used 
to wonder at London. The excellently illustrated 
weeklies emanating from that city pictured the 
streets filled with crippled men and the wreckage of 
Zeppelin raids, and the theater stages ablaze with the 
khaki-clad choruses of new musical comedies 
avowedly inspired by the war. The last two years 
'have given New York, and the rest of America, a 
taste of the same indecency. For a time every tall 
Venus draped in the colors of an Allied country was 
received among us with applause that drowned the 
music of the national anthem she danced to. A 
chorus of such allegorical figures aroused deeper 
feelings of spiritual unity with our Allies than have 
since been inspired by the peace-pageant at Paris. 
Such diverse theatrical performances as The Better 
'Ole and The Burgomaster of Belgium remind us 
that we have been in the war, and that we are still 
so much in it that we cannot look at it open-eyed. 



The Bairnsfather-Eliot " fragment from France '' 
serves the mellow mood that has growin out of vic- 
tory. In reality its humor is just as appropriate as 
that of Hamlet's grave-diggers but the irony of the 
situation is lost upon the audience and, we think, 
upon the authors. For Old Bill's armor of blind 
cheerfulness the Burgomaster substitutes another 
and a better defense against reality. A mind fully 
occupied with 'horror of the enemy has no place for 
a more monstrous horror. But some day, when we 
dare look at war again for what it is, somebody will 
write a real war play. The people who have sons 
and brothers buried in France will not be able to 
sit through this play. Many men who were there 
in the lines and came back again will be afraid to 
see it. ... In many households of diseased in- 
heritance, conventionality has deadened thought; in 
such households Ibsen's Ghosts is unendurable. The 
real war play will be like that; it will let realities 
crawl out from behind the curtain of emotion. 

OUT OF RESPECT TO MR. GEORGE SYLVESTER 
Viereck it is impossible to review his psychoanalytic 
study of Theodore Roosevelt (Jackson Press; New 
York). He 'has prophesied that it will not be 
reviewed in the American ipress, and a prophet must 
not be left without honor in his own land. Besides, 
the book is of a nature to confuse the unsophisticated 
reviewer. It has nothing to do with psychoanalysis ; 
little to do with the late president; and everything 
oh! pages and pages to do with Mr. Viereck. 
Why should a student of psychoanalysis give him- 
self away so completely: is it that he lacks the 
Freudian technique of self-analysis? The author of 
The Erotic Motive in Literature (Boni & Live- 
Tight), Mr. Albert Mordell, w 7 ill be happy to supply 
him a vocabulary which will obviate the necessity for 
his studying the subject. Mr. Viereck cruelly pub- 
lishes Roosevelt's ante-bellum eulogies of Mr. 
William Hohenzollern, late German Emperor; 
therefore he is sadistic; he suffers from his admira- 
tion for Mr. Roosevelt; therefore, he is masochistic; 
he peeps at Mr. Roosevelt's naked soul; therefore 
he is voyeuristic; 'he exhibits the true inwardness of 
his own personality and career, and therefore he is 
exhibitionistic ! Mr. Viereck must not object to this 
reciprocal analysis of his character, for as he him- 
self has aptly paraphrased, those w j ho take up psy- 
choanalysis shall perish by psychoanalysis. Of course 
this 'has nothing to do with Mr. Viereck's repute as 
a literary man, or with the decision of the Author's 
League to take away his union label. And, to speak 
frankly, Mr. Mordell is not capable of contributing 
a valid criticism of Mr. Viereck's standing in that 
department: his appreciation of literature is as deep 
as Mr. Viereck's knowledge of the psychoanalyst's 
technique, and may be expressed mathematically as 
varying inversely with the number of terms the 
author has extracted from the work of Freud, Brill, 
and others. A rich Freudian vocabulary, however, 
is hardly an adequate substitute for a mature insight 



1919

into 'human motives and actions. An author who 
can cite the mental evolution of John Ruskin from 
art critic to economist as an evidence oi : eccentricity 
is incapable of evaluating the most simple psycho- 
logical development. The assumption of the Freud- 
ian technique in the case of such a person is a 
simple defense reaction to prevent the exposure of 
his incriminating lack of common sense. The 
method is to substitute a verbal symbol for a genuine 
idea. It is a mark of the pseudo-Freudian that he 
holds the symbol to be more significant than the 
fact. His mythological conception of human 
origins does not begin with the union of Adam and 
Eve: it begins with the serpent. And the serpent 
leaves the slimy trail of its symbolism across the 
whole garden of existence. 

The Bellman [b.l906-d.J.919] "will not overstay his 
welcome or overplay his part. . . . Other times and 
other manners, also other journals to suit them." 

The Review [b.!919-d. ?] "takes itself so seriously that 
the difficulty will be ... simply to secure readers, or 
enough of them, in this country, who were born without 
a sense of humor." The Bellman, Farewell Number, 
June 28, 



IT IS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE DlAL 

turns to look down Grub Street after the depart- 
ing figure of The Bellman. For thirteen years 
this dignified person has gone this way each week, 
garbed always in the red waistcoat and three-cor- 
nered hat which set off to best advantage a florid 
countenance glowing with respectable sincerity. Of 
late a puzzled expression has become familiar to 
this face; The Bellman's voice has seemed a trifle 
querulous; the notes of the Bell itself have at times 
been scarcely audible among the multitudinous new 
voices in the street. But bravely now, if thinly, 
tinkles its swan-song: 

At last, on June 23, it was officially announced that the 
republican government of Germany had acceded uncon- 
ditionally to the allies' terms, and thus peace was at last 
assured, with democracy triumphant in every part of the 
world, and the League of Nations created as a prom.se 
for the future of mankind. 

And, on June 28, having rung in the new, the Bell 
falls silent! But not before the Bellman has met 
and saluted another figure, bound out into the town. 
This stranger, an infant in stature, has the parch- 
ment face, the solemn vacant eye, the fumbling 
gestures of extreme age; his broadcloth garb, his 
slow and measured step, and above all the con- 
vincing angle at which he carries his cane proclaim 
him a gentleman of immaculate lineage and indis- 
putable good taste. With a well-bred, humorless 
smile of skepticism, he listens to the last op- 
timistic echoes of the Bell, shakes his head sadly, 
and crosses the street, stepping daintily round the 
puddles in the roadway and pausing at the nearer 
curb to buy a paper and drop a penny in a beggar's 
cap. Then he tucks his stick under his arm, 



spreads the paper for convenient reading as he goes 
along, and displays before our very eyes an arrest- 
ing headline: "Democracy Triumphant . . . 
Russia . . Hungary . . . Rumors of 

Something Happening . . ." For a moment the 
little old gentleman's savoir faire deserts him. Then 
his expression of puzzlement gives place to one of 
anger, and he calls out after the manner of a 
town crier "Hear ye! Hear ye! Nothing shall 
ever happen here! " And at that he shakes his cane 
excitedly, as though it were a bell, apparently ob- 
livious to the fact that it gives forth no sound. Thus 
crying and gesticulating, he goes on his way, and 
in a moment his dry monotone is lost amidst the 
multitudinous new voices in the street. 

IN- THESE DAYS OF DISILLUSIONMENT AND ECO- 

nomic upheaval there no longer inheres in statesman- 
ship such dignity as resided there .when nationalistic 
politics were in full glory. The statesman is a liberal 
or a conservative never of revolutionary tenden- 
cies, except perhaps where revolution is purely po- 
litical in character. It would seem then that Sir 
Horace Plunkett and the other founders of The 
Irish Statesman have limited by a name the cruis- 
ing radius of their new weekly, just launched out 
into the stormy Irish Sea. However Sir Horace's 
record in the Irish cooperative movement promises 
wider economic interests than the name of the pub- 
lication implies. For the time being, the periodical 
"will devote its main, but not its whole, attention 
to the immediate satisfaction of ... the 
fundamental right of self-government," realizable, 
the editors believe, through the creation in Ireland 
of an instrument of government modeled upon those 
of the British' overseas dominions. With liberalism 
in politics the new journal will combine the ex- 
pected modicum of interest in the arts, giving Sir 
Horace Plunkett a running mate in the person of 
W. B. Yeats, who proposes, so the announcement 
says, " to deal with new tendencies and rival 
theories [in the arts] rather than with the com- 
parative merits of individual works."

REVOLUTIONARY MANNERS, AMERICAN 
AND RUSSIAN 

SIR: In 1776 an active, organized, and disre- 
spectable- minority was able in America then, as in 
Russia today, to overthrow the constituted political 
authority and to direct a revolution along the Bol- 
sheviki lines. Take the following account of the 
American- Bolsheviki of 1776-87 done in twentieth 
century style a la Russe: 

From lawless persecution of the antis by irresponsible 
mobs, the Bolsheviki had advanced to a control by revo- 
lutionary committees, who drove them from the commun- 
ity, denouncing them as " incorrigibles," and forbidding 
them food or comfort. Then the provincial conventions 
took them in hand, and finally the district Soviets and the 
Soviet Congress. The aim of persecution seemed at first 
to be the conversion of the anti; but as the war advanced 
a spirit of revenge and hate was manifest. The 
Bolsheviki forgot that these men had been their respected 
neighbors, and they seemed to believe them born with a 
natural ferocity, like the savage. 

The refugees at least escaped further personal persecu- 
tion, though they left their property at the mercy of the 
Bolsheviki; but the suspected antis those who did not 



openly take the British side, though they would not de- 
clare against them were constant sufferers. They were 
early deprived of the right to vote, for they were not 
citizens of the new state, the Bolsheviki argued, if they 
refused the oath of allegiance. When they tried to vote 
they were fined or imprisoned. All offices of trust or profit 
\vere forbidden them. In the courts of law not even the 
rights of a foreigner were left them. . . . Their deeds 
of gift were invalid, and their property was at the mercy 
of their fellow-men. None of them might serve on a jury, 
and lawyers who refused the oath of allegiance to the 
Bolshevik cause were denied practice in the courts. . . . 
That the rabble should have made all practical justice 
impossible for the antis was an inevitable result of the 
war, but the refusal by the Soviets of even theoretical 
justice shows how deep-seated political hate had become. 
. . . The laws did not stop here, but placed an inter- 
dict upon all speaking or writing against the Bolshevik 
cause. [The] Congress [of Soviets] urged this . . . 
and the states acted so readily that it was soon truthfully 
said that " there is more liberty in Turkey than in the 
dominions of Congress." . . . No word was tolerated 
against the raising of a Soviet army, and not whisper 
derogatory to the Soviet money. Undoubted Bolsheviki 
might safely refuse the paper money, but a suspected anti 
became the sink for all this financial refuse. . . . Let 
him protest, and a violent attack swept away all his wealth 
at once. He was treated as a " disaffected and evil- 
minded person " who had entered a " gigantic plot " to 
depreciate the Soviet money. 

In the midst of this democratic revolution the liberty of 
the individual was hedged on every side. The presence 
of many spies made the identification of strangers very 
important, hence every traveller, whether gentleman, ex- 
press carrier, or common beggar, was forced to keep a 
certificate of character from Congress or some local com- 
mittee. Innkeepers, ferrymen, and stage-drivers were 
fined if they failed to ask for it. Reputed antis could not 
get these certificates and were in consequence tied to their 
homes. . . . Whole anti districts were at times 
" rooted out," that those " abominable pests of society " 
might be prevented from mischief. " Not to crush these 
serpents before their rattles are grown," wrote General 
L , " would be ruinous." 

During their enforced journeys to exile, the antis 
asserted that they were treated with great cruelty, even 
driven like herds of cattle to distant provinces. . . . 
Armed bands of rangers scoured the country in every 
direction in search of " traitors," bringing their victims to 
special committees for trial. In general, the provinces 
which were the seats of active war made the most 
rigorous application of the treason laws. . . . 

Not only were the refugees forever exiled if attainted 
with treason, but they had no property with which to 
resume the ojd life, even if permitted to return unmolested 
to their former dwelling-places. Every vestige of their 
possessions had been taken from them, at first by a nibbling 
system of fines and special taxation, and later by the 
" all-devouring rage for confiscation." 

It may be rather startling to turn to such a 
modernized version of the standard authority on the 
American Revolution (C. H. Van Tyne, The 
American Revolution, in The American Nation: A 
History, vol. 9, p. 255 et seq.}. It is presented 
verbatim with all the changes indicated by italicized 
words. The Whigs were obviously the Bolsheviki of 
that day; the Tories or Loyalists were the antis; 
while the Continental Congress, with its entirely 
extra-legal and revolutionary authority, was the 
forerunner of the modern Soviet.

AN EARLY DEFIER OF ROYALTY 

SIR : In these days when the trade of king and em- 
peror is attended with certain hazards, it may not 
he out of place to call attention to the following 
letter, which was addressed to that very absolute 
and Christian monarch, Philip II of Spain. It is 
taken from the early accounts of Amazonian ex- 
ploration, translated and published by the Hakluyt 
Society. The letter has been lost sight of, although 
it might have played a useful part in the various 
struggles against royal authority in the past, and 
would have given some comfort to Cromwell and 
possibly to the denouncers of George III. The 
author is Lope de Aguirre, who was a member of 
an exploring expedition organized in 1549 by Pedro 
de Ursua, governor of Quito in Peru. 

The expedition descended the river Huallaga to 
the Amazon. There Aguirre conspired against 
Ursua, murdered him and his wife, elected one Guz- 
man to the command, and continued the voyage in 
search of gold and El Dorado. Aguirre afterwards 
killed Guzman and made himself chief. His 
course down the river was marked by cruelties and 
atrocities of every kind, so that the name Aguirre 
is still used by the Indians to frighten their children. 
He finally reached the sea. The following is a 
letter he sent to Philip: 

I take it for certain that few kings go to hell, because 
they are so few in number, but if there were many none 
of them would go to heaven. For I believe that you are 
all worse than Lucifer, and that you hunger and thirst 
after human blood; and further, I think little of you and 
despise you all, nor do I look upon your government 
as more than an air bubble. They named me Maestro del 
Campo, and because I did not consent to their evil deeds 
they desired to murder me. I therefore killed our new 
king (Ursua), the captain of his guard, his lieutenant 
general, four captains, his major domo, his chaplain who 
said mass, a woman, a knight of the order of Rhodes, an 
admiral, two ensigns and five or six of his servants. It 
is my intention to carry on the war on account of the 
many cruelties which thy ministers have committed. I 
named captains and sergeants, and because these men 
wanted to kill me I hanged them all. We continued our 
course while all this evil was befalling us, and it was 
eleven months and a half before we reached the mouth 
of the river, having travelled more than fifteen hundred 
leagues. I advise thee not to send any Spanish fleet up 
i his ill-omened river, for on the faith of a Christian I 
swear to thee, O King, that if a hundred thousand men 
should go up not one would escape. 

It is sad to relate that the King did send a fleet, 
and captured and hanged Aguirre.

WRITING TO THE TIMES 

SIR: THE DIAL has done great service in call- 
ing attention to the outrageous disregard of the pub- 
lic press for truth or for honor. In particular you 
have had occasion to point out the sins of the New 
York Times in this regard. Perhaps your Dreaders 
will be interested in another illustration: 

On June 25 the New York Times printed rather 



prominently a letter from William Adams Brown 
Jr., who took as his text the report of a speech of 
mine on Russia. The communication w r as headed 
Radicals for Tyranny They Demand Freedom 
Here But Would Crush It in Russia. And the 
heading was a somewhat abrupt way of saying what 
the writer had said more courteously. Mr. Brown 
also alleged that Admiral Kolchak had no responsi- 
bility for the ghastly "death train," and that it was 
" false and indefensible " in me to blame Kolchak 
for it. 

To this letter I replied, pointing out that the 
death train was last heard of on December 20, and 
that Admiral Kolchak after a coup d'etat pro- 
claimed himself supreme ruler in Siberia on Novem- 
ber 1 8, so that it was difficult to see why he had no 
responsibility for the train. I also stated that I had 
consistently criticized Bolshevism for its denial of 
civil liberty, but went on to point out reasons why 
the Soviet Government was infinitely preferable to 
Admiral Kolchak's dictatorship. 

The New York Times never published this letter 
of mine and never answered any inquiries with 
regard to it, and yet the New York Times talks 
piously about Bolshevik denials of free speech. It 
is very evident that our ruling classes are leaving 
nothing undone to prove that Lenin was right when 
he said there was no freedom of speech in the so- 
called democracies of the West because the capital- 
ist class controlled the newspapers, halls, and 
meeting places.

Notes on New Books 

THE WILD SWANS OF COOLE. By William 
Butler Yeats. 114 pages. Macmillan. 

The world loves to weigh its hypothetical losses 
particularly in the domain of art, where the deflec- 
tion of a craftsman who has made a noteworthy con- 
tribution in one field and has subsequently directed 
his talents into other channels becomes a theme of 
exhaustless speculation. To say what a poet or a 
dramatist might have done, if he had not done some- 
thing else, is a species of criticism in which the haz- 
ards of refutation are slight, a circumstance which 
possibly accounts for its wide dissemination. To 
estimate achievements which in the nature of 
things cannot exist is a facile form o-f appre- 
ciation, a mode of appraisal perhaps too patronizing 
to be prized. William Butler Yeats has come in 
for occasional doses of this sedative in the shape of 
recurrent sighs over the loss which his absorption in 
the Irish Literary Theatre movement involved to 
his lyric output. One recalls Mr. Weygandt, in 
Irish Plays and Playwrights, raising the question 
whether the world shall win " adequate compensa- 
tion" for the "lost lyrics" of the Yeats of the nineties. 
Other voices, raised in a similar query, emphasize 
tiheir point by pouncing upon the lyric passages in 
Yea ts r dramatic poetry as though these were hares of 
the chase triumphant trophies of vindication. The 
defect of all such puzzling is, of course, a failure to 
take account of, or at any rate to credit, the inner 
creative impulses of the artist, which are pretty 
generally at the root of the deflection and pretty 
generally unanswerable. The appearance of a new 
'volume of Yeats' verse, The Wild Swans of Coole, 
may serve to fan the embers of speculation. There 
are not, however, among these forty poems any 
which are destined to strengthen the contention of 
the mourners over the "lost lyrics." Despite flashes 
of the old magic, and passages which glow with 
Yeats' haunting fervor, there is an absence of that 
sustained mystic charm which pervaded the earlier 
collections. Nor is the folk flavor so delicately 
mirrored as it used to be. Indeed, the mood of the 
collection is largely retrospective a fact of which 
the poet seems recurrently conscious : 

Discoverers of forgotten truth 

Or mere companions of my youth, 

All, all are in my thoughts to-night, being dead. 

The foregoing is from the poem In Memory of 
Major Robert Gregory. There is another, Men 
Improve With die Years: 

But I grow old among dreams, 
A weather-worn, marble triton 
Among the streams. 

One or two of the briefer poems, notably one called 
To a Squirrel at Kyle-na-Gno, present Yeats in the 
aspect of seeking to copy the simplicity, or rather the 
Irish naivete, of James Stephens and doing it in- 



differently well. As for The Balloon of the Mind 

Hands, do what you're bid; 
Bring the balloon of the mind 
That bellies and drags in the wind 
Into its narrow shed 

it has the gesture of Greenwich Village about it. 
More in the spirit of the earlier Yeats are The 
Phases of the Moon, with its su'btly evoked images, 
and The Sad Shepherd, told with the poetic dignity 
which weaves a potent charm. Considered as a 
whole, however, The Wild Swans of Coole beat 
upon the fancy with ineffectual wings. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE PRACTICAL MYSTIC. 
By Francis Grierson. 93 pages. Lane. 

One is tempted to dispose of this bizarre and 
pathetically insipid volume, by one of our most 
distinguished " culture-philistines " (to employ 
Nietzsche's phrase), simply by the method of quota- 
tion if only because one's sense of humor makes 
any critical analysis quite impossible. The book is 
sufficiently described in its sub-title: we are told, 
in so many words, to fall down upon our knees and 
worship Abraham Lincoln, " the greatest practical 
mystic the world has known for nineteen hundred 
years " not to make Christ subordinate to the 
astute joke-loving statesman who " saved the 
Union " for the greater future of the recent war. 
On this latter, Francis Grierson has a little, though 
quite unconscious, joke of his own: "The war," 
he says, speaking of the " spiritual renaissance " that 
is upon us, " has crushed the juice out of the orange 
on the tree of pleasure and nothing is left but the 
peel over which materialism is slipping to its doom." 
One suspects that Mr. Grierson intends something 
.very mystical here, but the secret is between him 
and Abraham Lincoln. What Lincoln would have 
thought of this book may be deduced from an anec- 
dote the book relates, an illustration of the Great 
Emancipator's sardonic way of dealing with en- 
thusiasts of all kinds: 

Lincoln received them with a neutral politeness, some- 
times mingled with a grim humor, as when Robert Dale 
Owen read to him a long manuscript presumed to be 
highly inspirational and illuminating, and Lincoln re- 
plied, "Well, for those who like that sort of thing that 
is the thing they would like." 



NEW FALLACIES OF MIDAS. By Cyril E. 
Robinson. 294 pages. McBride. 

The author of this book does not make any fresh 
contributions to political economy. His survey of 
industrial and economic problems proceeds from 
the baseline established by the classical school, and 
his triangulations come to an appropriate apex in 
two chapters on " the rights of the individual " and 
" compromise." What gives the work some slight 
distinction is that whereas the methods of the sur- 
vey are traditional the ground over which the author 



1919 



THE DIAL 



73 



ranges has been explored only in a perfunctory way 
by the orthodox economist. Mr. Robinson is 
cognizant of contributions to his science which have 
not been fitted into the main body of economic doc- 
trine : the socialist, the syndicalist, the guild social- 
ist, the cooperator, he does not ignore. The pro- 
test of Ruskin is considered and Unto This Last 
is finally recognized for whait it is a wonderful 
book, worthy of examination and criticism. More- 
over there is a chapter on Utopia, a review of 
Morris's News from Nowhere. This is an excellent 
indication of the author's willingness to consider 
foreign hypotheses, even though 'it is not pledge of 
a just appraisal. Heretofore the only Utopia the 
economist deemed worthy of consideration was that 
quite non-existent paradise of perfect competition, 
complete freedom of contract, and corrosive in- 
dividualism which the most depraved realities of 
Manchester, Lille, Elberfeld-Barmen, and Newark 
only faintly simulated. The economist's assertion 
that this particular Utopia of his is any nearer to 
the current situation is contradicted by the 
numerous exceptions he is compelled to make in 
order to take into account the existence of monopo- 
lies, corporations, and trade unions. In fact the 
exceptions overwhelm the rule. In treating the 
commercial economist's social postulates as the basis 
of merely one out of n number of possible Utopias 
Mr. Robinson has made a considerable advance in 
logical technique. It is a method calculated to 
relax the bonds of economic dogma. 

THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP. By Christopher 
Morely. 289 pages. Doubleday, Page. 

With Mr. Morley the emphasis is always on 
the cultivation, and never on the cult, of letters; 
he leaves polemics to the profound. He hugs his 
literary likings openly a weakness perhaps, but 
one from which he draws a genial, boyish delight. 
Furthermore it is a quality which wins him a circle 
of influence fairly impervious to the disparagements 
of those who maintain that literature should com- 
mand more judicial handling. There are snatches 
of almost everything in The Haunted Bookshop, 
for Mr. Morley throws off his impressions like an 
emery wheel a contact which can hardly fail to 
sharpen one's bookish edge. To be sure, the selec- 
tive instinct is still in a rudimentary state, and The 
Haunted Bookshop shelters some trivial ghosts 
so many in fact that the author may be accused of 
mirroring the superficialities of the contemporary 
(1919) mind too assiduously. Time will deal 
hardshly with Mr. Morley 's tarrying over Tarzan 
and kindred ephemera. As for the plot which gives 
a fictional skeleton to the book, it is perhaps the 
most cheerfully unconvincing myth of pro-German 
intrigue on record. One can only credit the actions 
of Mr. Morley's secret agents by assuming that they 
chose to sacrifice the Fatherland upon the altar of 
Mr. Morley's convenience. 



A HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR. By Sir 
Arthur Conan Doyle. Vol. 4. 313 pages.

FIFTY YEARS OF EUROPE. By Charles 
Downer Hazen. 428 pages. Holt. 

Ultimately books about the war will divide into 
two classes: history and apology. The line be- 
tween them is not yet established. The historian 
loses his neutral interest in truth, and doth protest 
too much; the apologist desires to make out a case 
for himself or his tribe and manhandles the evi- 
dence. In despair at arriving at an unperverted 
account of the facts the unpartisan reader might 
well be tempted to lay aside the weighty burden of 
critical appreciation and allow the whole mass of 
apologetic history and historic apology to be handed 
down, unsorted, to those Keepers of the Book of 
Judgment, the future generations. Certain books 
however are strait enough to avoid moral and in- 
tellectual messiness: Sir Conan Doyle's volumin- 
ous narrative of the Western conflict is one of 
them. The present volume embraces the British 
campaign in France and Flanders in 1917, and 
since the ban is now off mentioning the names of 
units, it should be of considerable interest to those 
who participated, by personal effort or by sympathy, 
in the movements of that critical year. It is one 
of those works which everyone must have and no 
one is under any compulsion to read. Major-Gen- 
eral Sir F. Maurice's book is in a different class. 
He limits his field of inquiry to the perilous forty 
days in 1914 which lost the war for Germany. 
Without asserting that his is an authoritative his- 
tory, Sir Frederick makes an interesting conjectural 
analysis of the German plan of campaign. After 
pointing out that the abilities of the Allies in mili- 
tary and economic organization were not inferior 
to those of the Central Powers, and that the Anglo- 
French field strategy, even in the early days, was full 
of unexpectedly superior brilliancies, the author at- 
tributes Germany's prolonged differentia! advan- 
tage to the unity of the high command. This was 
capable of not merely employing " military force to 
the best advantage, 'but of combining the whole 
power of the nation, the whole political, diplomatic, 
naval, financial, and industrial strength of the 
country for the defeat of the enemy." 

What lack of mere military unity could result in 
is exposed in Mr. H. W. Nevinson's version of 
the Dardanelles Campaign. His method, in con- 
trast to that of Philip Gibbs, is confessedly almost 
to obliterate the individual soldier from considera- 
tion. But perhaps Masefield's Gallipoli fills up 



74 



THE DIAL

this human vacancy, and Mr. Nevinson is justified 
in devoting himself to the pious task of pointing out 
the potential strategic strength of this ill-starred 
campaign. Viscount French's 1914 covers slightly 
more ground than Maurice's survey, and is more 
in the nature of an official explanation and personal 
apology. It leads up to the famous ammunition 
expose of 1915, which caused the collapse of 
Asquithian hesitantism and the triumph of the dual 
alliance of Northcliffe and Lloyd George in the 
new coalition government. Viscount French's 
justifications have been criticized in England, and 
Mr. Asquith himself has questioned their faithful- 
ness to fact. But on this side of the Atlantic one 
may well suggest that the politics of 1914 are as 
dead as the heroes of Mons and Ypres, and the 
skeleton of the controversy has about it merely that 
indefinable bad odor suggestive of the grave. The 
political starting-point of all these reminiscences, 
_ recriminations, and reinvestigations is the subject 
of Professor Hazen's Fifty Years of Europe. It is 
the latter half of his Modern European History, 
brought up to date by a chapter which bears irritat- 
ing evidence of having been written during the war. 
The sins of Germany are unduly emphasized by 
the omission of an account of the reproachable ele- 
ments in the policy of the Triple Entente, both in 
international affairs, and in their separate private 
concerns. There is the skeleton of accurate nar- 
rative, but not the living breath of truth. If Pro- 
fessor Kazan could not write about the invasion of 
Belgium with that fine restraint which characterizes 
his brief description of the British occupation of 
Egypt) it was at least incumbent upon him to char- 
acterize the latter act with the same sort of hearty 
moral indignation he heaps upon the former. His- 
tory does not exist where there is a discrimination 
between " those to whom we wish to be just, and 
those to whom we do not wish to be just." The 
military men have set the historians the proper tone 
for treating the late enemy, for they were close 
enough to actual warfare to know how dangerous 
it is to establish headquarters in glass houses. 

SKETCHES AND REVIEWS. By Walter Pater. 
150 pages. Boni and Liveright. 

The literary evaluations which men of letters put 
upon the product of their contemporaries, under the 
journalistic requirements of short-focus examination, 
are frequently of more than transient interest, par- 
ticularly when the subject of the review subse- 
quently attains a secure niche in the corridor of 
fame. There is, therefore, ample justification for 
the reprinting of these reviews of Pater, with their 
appraisals of such figures as Lemaitre, Wilde, 
Symons, and George Moore. Pater clearly con- 
sidered the critical review no place for the selfish 
display of his own talents, and these brief studies 
are marked throughout with restraint and with 
poise. For the most part, there is quiet, considered 



utterance, with now and then a flash of unreserved 
enthusiasm, as in the instance of Arthur Symons, 
whom he hails for his " gift of lucidity." " In this 
new poet the rich poetic vintage of our time has 
run clear at last," he affirms. The opening essay, on 
Aesthetic Poetry, is most emphatically in the manner 
of the stylist. Writing of the " strange delirious 
part " which the things of nature played in the 
sensuousness of medieval poetry, he says: "A 
passion of which the outlets are sealed, begets a ten- 
sion of nerve, in which the sensible world comes to 
one with a reinforced brilliancy and relief all red- 
ness is turned to blood, all water to tears." There 
is keen analysis in Coleridge as a Theologian "with 
a true speculative talent he united a false kind of 
subtlety and a full share of vanity " and there 
are illuminative paragraphs on such antagonistic 
topics as Wordsworth and Wilde. 

VOLTAIRE IN His LETTERS. By S. G. Tallen- 
tyre. 270 pages. Putnam. 

Under this title S. G. Tallentyre, author of The 
Life of Voltaire and The Friends of Voltaire, offers 
gleanings, from a published correspondence filling 
eighteen volumes in the omnibus edition. By re- 
ducing so large a subject matter to such compre? 
hensible limits, Mr. Tallentyre gives the impres- 
sion that he is seeking to reawaken interest in the 
sardonic figure upon which he has already lavished 
so much time, and that 'he has in mind the average 
reader, who must be tempted with small morsels be- 
fore he can stomach the entire Voltarian banquet. 
But is the average reader to be so ensnared? Does 
the average reader read Voltaire or wish to read 
him ? We may ask with equal impunity if the aver- 
age reader reads Dr. Johnson. And are not Vol- 
taire and Dr. Johnson alike in this respect that they 
remain for him figures of history rather than figures 
of literature? 

The book under discussion, whose immediate aim 
it must be to make us better acquainted with Vol- 
taire the man, fails to accomplish its purpose. We 
see many sides of the author of these letters, but 
so desultory is our view bound to be, considering the 
vast bulk from which these few selections are taken, 
and so often perfunctory is the mood behind the 
pen, that the resultant and composite picture is too 
faint for recognition. All this is 'harsh criticism 
for a work that shows a great deal of love and sym- 
pathy on the part of the translator, who exhibits a 
keen desire to present all phases of Voltaire's life. 
But the "gentlest art" of letter writing must be 
practiced by natures more intimate and less formal 
than Voltaire's if it is at the best to offer more than 
glimpses of the writer. Voltaire is at all times 
grandiloquent and oratorical, and the effect is that 
he wrote 'his letters, not for the special benefit of the 
persons addressed, but for a vast and admiring aud- 
ience more easily reached through other media.

THE POLITICS 
OF INDUSTRY 

By GLENN FRANK 

Co-author of "Stakes of the War," etc. 

BOOK tbat will help the alert American to anticipate 
and discount the social and industrial crises that aro 
certain to develop in the near future. The papers that makt> 
up the volume are said by many business and labor leaders 
who have read them to constitute the sanest and clearest 
statement yet made regarding the social unrest, the labor 
problem, and the part American business men may play in 
this period of readjustment following the war. 

The book contains the following five papers : A Nation of 
Improvisers ; The Background of Reconstruction ; Anony- 
mous Liberalism ; The Politics of Industry ; Business States- 
manship. 

The author says in his Foreword : " The statesmanship or 
stupidity of business men is of more social significance than 
the statesmanship or stupidity of politicians. The irecog- 
nition of this fact brought an interesting task into my 
hands. During the past year it has been my assignment 
and my pleasure to try to interpret the mind and the atti- 
tude of the more forward-looking business and industrial 
leaders of this country in relation to the social and indus- 
trial unrest and the pervasive spirit of change that marks 
our time. I have tried to catch their spirit rather than 
quote their words."

WHAT IS 
AMERICA? 

By EDWARD ALSWORTH ROSS 

Author of "Russia in Upheaval,'' "Changing America," etc.; 
Professor of Sociology in The University of Wisconsin. 

Professor Ross always has something to say, and he knows 
how to say it. Following is his description of his intention 
in writing "What Is America?": 

" Our society is developing as the fathers neither foresaw 
nor intended. Its path is determined chiefly by the instincts 
of multitudes as in the westward movement and European 
immigration by our inherited institutions, and by the re- 
moter effects of mechanical inventions. In the course of 
this development strain is produced on a large scale. You 
cannot lay it to persons, it is simply a by-product of social 
evolution. Of course we should seek out a remedy, but, in 
the meantime, we need not begin to quarrel among our- 
selves and hate one another. 

" The bulk of Americans well understand this. There are 
some who will do nothing about the suffering in the wake 
of social evolution lest their profits be disturbed. There are 
others who hold certain individuals responsible for this 
suffering and would wreck society in order to get at them. 
Between these are the steady-going millions who, without 
Josing their tempers, seek patiently for remedies. They have 
contended with a long series of grave problems, yet have 
not turned bitter. They exhibit that ' firm adherence to 
justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue,' with- 
out which, according to the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776, 
' no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be 
preserved to any people.' 

" It is to vindicate and commend this ' virtuous democ- 
racy ' that I offer this little book."

THE DIAL 



Books of the Fortnight 

The Science of Labour and Its Organisation, by Josefa 
loteyko (199 pages; Button), is an essay in industrial 
psycho-physiology. It examines four topics : the 
human motor, the principles of scientific management, 
the power and aptitude for work, and Belgian meth- 
ods of technical education. Review later. 

An American Labor Policy, by Julius Henry Cohen (110 
pages; Macmillan), expresses the hope that Mr. Gom- 
pers and Mr. Rockefeller may be brought together 
through contracts arrived at by collective bargaining 
and enforceable at law. 

Introduction to Economics, by John Roscoe Turner (641 
pages; Scribner), like the textbooks of Seager, Taus- 
sig, Fetter, and Ely, takes the data of economics for 
granted and deals with the application of " economic 
principles." It differs somewhat from recent discus- 
sions in its emphasis on productive capacity, and its 
almost complete neglect of the theories of consump- 
tion and distribution. 

The Politics of Industry, by Glenn Frank (214 pages; 
Century), modestly purports to be "a footnote to the 
social unrest." The author is an associate editor of 
the Century Magazine. He has concerned himself 
not with the " rank and file, but with those anonymous 
liberals of the business world the men who may per- 
chance be the pioneers of the new order of business 
and industry." Review later. 

The Old Freedom, by Francis Neilson (176 pqges; 
Huebsch), is a plea for a system of voluntary coopera- 
tion and a return to " unlimited individualism," on 
the ground that this is essential if the cause of human- 
ity and the brotherhood of man is to triumph. Review 
later. 

The German Empire, 1867-1914, by William Harbutt 
Dawson (2 vols., 1031 pages; Macmillan), is a sur- 
vey of Germany's political history by a scholar of 
first rank who had in mind " less the limited circle 
of scholars and students than those 'general readers,' " 
who wish to form their opinions on foreign politics 
independently, intelligently, and therefore on adequate 
information. Review later. 

Prussianism and Pacifism, by Poultney Bigelow (273 
pages; Putnam), is a study of the two Wilhelms 
between the Revolutions of 1848 and 1918, by one 
who presumes upon the privileges of old acquaintance 
to write an account of Herr W. Hohenzollern's per- 
sonal and public career. 

What Is America? by Edward Allsworth Ross (159 
pages; Century), is an elementary disquisition on 
the make-up of the American people, with respect to 
the family, government, education, business, labor, and 
so forth. Review later. 

A History of the Jews, by Paul Goodman (164 pages; 
Dutton), presents in a compact narrative the develop- 
ment of the Jews as a Kulturvolk from the time oi 
Abraham to that of Zangwill. 

Zionism and the Future of Palestine, by Morris Jastrow 
(159 pages; Macmillan), is a criticism of political 
Zionism. The author fears that " a Jewish State 
would simply mean a glorified ghetto, narrow in out- 
look, undemocratic in organization, and that it may 
well turn out to be reactionary in its tendencies." 
Review later. 



Past and Present, by Israel Friedlander (488 pages; Ark 
Publishing Company, Cincinnati), is a collection of 
Jewish Essays published from time to time by the 
author since 1899. It attempts to interpret the events 
of the past in the light of the present and vice-versa. 
The twenty-eight papers range from The Political 
Ideal of the Prophets to Palestine and the World 
War. Review later. 

.Mind and Conduct, by Henry Rutgers Marshall (236 
pages; Scribner), treats certain problems of conduct 
in relation to the new psychology of behavior. This 
book contains the substance of the Morse Lectures at 
the Union Theological Seminary in 1919. Review 
later. 

Letters to Teachers, by Hartley B. Alexander (253 
pages; Open Court Publishing Co.; Chicago), col- 
lects a number of papers on educational reconstruc- 
tion, chiefly addressed to Nebraska teachers, by the 
professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska 
who is now President elect of the American Philo- 
sophical Association. Mr. Alexander is the author, 
among other books, of Poetry and the Individual 
(1907), Liberty and Democracy (1918), and two 
volumes in the Mythology of All Races series; and 
he has been a frequent contributor to THE DIAL. 
Review later. 

Carnegie Pensions, by J. McKeen Cattell (253 pages; 
Science Press), sets forth the position of those who 
are adverse to the Carnegie Foundation's plan of 
academic pensioning. It includes extracts from 214 
letters from university and college professors, an 
article on the history of the foundation by Professor 
Jastrow, and the reports of the American Association 
of University Professors. Review later. 

All the World, by Charles M. Sheldon (203 pages; 
Dor an), was first read to the author's congregation, 
and then published as a serial in the Christian Herald. 
It treats journalistically America's contemporary 
social issues, not in the fashion of the intellectually 
exuberant Mr. Wells but in the sincerely common- 
place manner of a very evangelical Harold Bell 
Wright. 

Why We Fail as Christians, by Robert Hunter (180 
pages; Macmillan), essays to show the implications 
of the teachings of Jesus in present-day society. The 
obstacles to a genuine Christian life encountered by 
Tolstoi serve the author as a starting-point of dis- 
cussion. 

Roosevelt: His Life, Meaning, and Messages, edited by 
William Griffith (4 vols., 1447 pages; Current Liter- 
ature Publishing Company), contains his principal 
speeches, letters, and magazine articles from 1899 to 
the date of his death. The fourth volume is a biog- 
raphy by Eugene Thwing. Review later. 

Theodore Roosevelt, by Russell J. Wilbur (40 pages; 
Houghton MifHin); is an appraisal of Roosevelt in 
sonnet and quatorzain. The thirty-eight pieces, with 
four exceptions, were written during the month from 
June 23 to July 24, 1918. They deal with the plati- 
tudinarian, the four-square man, the man of culture, 
and many other Rooseveltian selves, and show a rare 
combination of acute criticism, genial sympathy, and 
fine humor which suggests an American apotheosis 
of the now redoubtable Lytton Strachey. The greater 
part of the verses appeared in the New Republic last 
summer, and Mr. William Hard appropriately writes 
an introduction that makes one eager to see more of 
the work of Father Wilbur.

Social Studies of the War, by Elmer T. Clark (283 pages; 
Doran), are the result of two extended trips in 
Europe by a journalist who was commissioned to con- 
duct intensive social investigations for the daily and 
religious press of America, and the Y. M. C. A. The 
author asserts that he approaches all questions from 
the standpoint of the average man on the streets a 
due apology for a certain gossipy naivete and a lack 
of critical discernment. Review later. 

A History of the Great War, by Bertram Benedict (Vol. 1, 
412 pages; Bureau of National Literature; New 
York), marks one of the current attempts to write 
the history that cannot be adequately written for 
many years to come. The format of the volume sug- 
gests that it is intended for house-to-house vending 
by enterprising young collegians. Unquestionably the 
book is readable. Review later. 

Trailing the Bolsheviki,by Carl W. Ackerman (308 pages; 
Scribner), records a newspaper correspondent's experi- 
ences in Siberia. Apparently Mr. Ackerman did not 
get within shooting distance of his prey, but he has 
an interesting report to make on political and mili- 
tary conditions in Siberia, with respect especially to 
the activities of the Czecho-Slovaks and the Japanese. 
Review later. 

The Way of the Eagle, by Major Charles J. Biddle (297 
pages; Scribner), extends conventionality to the skies 
and succeeds in making the Air Service as matter- 
of-fact as the Quartermaster Corps. 

Memoir of Kenelm Henry Digby, by- Bernard Holland 
(251 pages; Longmans, Green), is a biography of a 
little known Catholic author who took no part in 
public affairs during his life and who has been forty 
years dead. Digby's more important books The 
Broadstone of Honour, Mores Catholici, and Com- 
fitum and perhaps some of his verse, deserve more 
attention than they have received from the reading 
public; but it is a question whether this can be se- 
cured through a biography, except as it persuades 
Catholic readers. Digby's books were markedly 
autobiographical ; and -they, along with this sympa- 
thetic Memoir, should be known to all students of the 
Oxford Movement. 

New Voices, by Marguerite Wilkinson (409 pages: Mac- 
millan), adds another volume about contemporary 
poets and poetry to the crowding line of critical 
anthologies, treatises, manifestoes, and year books. 
Better organized than its predecessors for it is 
divided between the Technique of Contemporary 
Poetry (Pattern, Organic Rhvthm, Images and Symbols, 
Diction, Conservatism, Radicalism) and its " Spirit " 
(Democracy, Patriotism, Love, Religion, Nature, 
Personality, Children) it is nevertheless, like many 
of them, too indiscriminately catholic in its admis- 
sions and groupings to illuminate the field very 
brightly except for culture clubs. It is illustrated 
by 9 photographs and 210 poems, which (being 
grouped by subject matter) develop some quaint fel- 
lowships. Review later. 

Great Artists and Their Works, by Great Authors, com- 
piled by Alfred Mansfield Brooks (267 pages; Mar- 
shall Jones; Boston), presents more than a hundred 
excerpts about art, or about works of art, from the 
writings of a varied list of men of letters from 
Homer to Lord BrVce, from Plutarch to Walter Crane. 
An uneven anthology that attests far-ranging if not 
always discriminating rambles in literature. A stim- 
ulating source-book in the philosophy of art. Review 
later. 



Hopes and Fears for Art, by William Morris (218 pages; 
Longmans, Green), reprints in a "pocket edition" 
five insufficiently known lectures: The Lesser Arts, 
The Art of the People, The Beauty of Life, Making 
the Best of It, and The Prospects of -Architecture in 
Civilization. Review later. 

Robbia Heraldry, by Allan Marquand (illustrated, 310 
pages, boxed; Princeton University Press), is another 
of the scholarly essays in fine-arts research that have 
lately come from Princeton. The text is authorita- 
tive and well ordered; the illustrations are numer- 
ous and excellent. 

Main Currents of Spanish Literature, by J. D. M. 
Ford (284 pages; Holt), presents in small compass 
a history of Spanish literature. Though the book 
may not succeed in arousing great interest in The 
Cid, it will undoubtedly make Ibafiae more intellig- 
ible. Review later. 

The Death of Turnus. by W. Warde Fowler (158 pages; 
Longmans, Green), succeeds his Aeneas at the Site 
of Rome with the text of the twelfth book of the 
Aeneid and the commentator's seasoned " observa- 
tions " on its background and implications. The re- 
flections are those of a liberal humanist who is some- 
times erudite to the verge of pedantry. 

Dangerous Days, by Mary Roberts Rinehart (400 pages; 
Doran), is another of this author's capably executed 
novels, although lacking in the freshness which has 
characterized some of its predecessors. It strikes 
, the martial chords without evoking any new har- 
mony, and falls somewhat behind The Amazing Inter- 
lude (Doran) in invention. 

The Choice, by Maurice Weyl (356 pages; Kennerley), 
is a first novel in which the author has made a 
serious attempt to deal with the casual forces which 
impel young people into dubious marriages before 
they have reached years of discretion. Both the style 
and the material suffer somewhat from over-simpli- 
fication. Mr. Weyl credits his readers with no more 
sophistication than he allows his heroine.. 

More E. K. Means (369 pages; Putnam) is a second se- 
lection from Mr. Means' inimitable dialect stories 
of the Southern village Negro, the legitimate heir 
to the "laughter and song" of Uncle Remus' ex- 
tinct plantation darkey. These blacks bear some- 
what the same relation to the conventionalized Negro 
of our contemporary fiction that the Irish peasants 
of Synge and Lady Gregory bear to the stage Irish- 
man of romance. Review later. .. 

Civilization: Tales of the Orient, by Ellen N. La Motte 
(267 pages; Doran), is a series of atmospheric and 
effective, though sometimes overcharged, short-story 
studies of the West as it meets the East in China 
and the tropics. They are so simply and directly 
written that their romance seems observed rather 
than contrived, and that their pathology is entirely 
credible. Review later. 

In Defense of Harriet Shelley, by "Mark Twain" (il- 
lustrated, 405 pages; Harper), is the first essay in a 
volume that reprints seventeen of the most popular 
papers of the humorist. The volume includes his 
memorial poem to Olivia Susan Clemens and a bio- 
graphical sketch by Samuel E. Moffett. 

"Same Old Bill, eh Mable! " by E. Streeter (illustrated, 
120 pages; Stokes), the third and final volume of 
the immortal rookies' vernacular letters, carries him 
over the top in France and into Germany after the 
signing of the Armistiee.

WE are publishing the writings of authors who dare to be rebels. We are trying to reflect the rising social 
current of the age the revolution in thought, the revolution in ethics, the revolution in art, and the 
revolution in industry. Boiler-plate literature does not appeal to us, and we believe it is becoming increas- 
ingly nauseating to large groups of intelligent people. We hold that the public is entitled to an absolutely free 
press, and we shall publish books of burning truth which may corrode and scorch the timid flesh of our literary 
pundits. Any book that is vital and interesting cannot be too strong nor too plain to suit us. 



REVOLT! 



By Harold Lord Varney 



(416 pages, illustrated by Cropper, Price $2.00) 



This startling labor novel Is one of the literary sensations of the year. Orders covering almost the entire 
first edition are In hand before the book is off the press. In presenting Harold Lord Varney to the reading public 
we are introducing a writer whose talent ia as unusual as his personality. He writes the theme that he has lived 
the wild, the bizarre, and the exotic. 

Why Do Men Revolt? 

This was the question which young Montgomery asked. 

And then, suddenly, he was plunged into the underworld. He learned his answer. He entered the surg- 
ing labor movement, where men toil, and dream, and die. He became an I. W. W. In the agonies of the class 
war, he revisioned life. And he himself became a revolutionist. 

This is the story which Harold Lord Varney tells in his gripping novel 



"REVOLT ! " 



For those who would understand the social revolution, the I. W. W., Bolshevism, and all the lurid forces 
of unrest, "REVOLT!" is an epochal book. It is a book of real people and real incidents. 
"REVOLT!" will be high among the best sellers for months to come. 

A Sort of a Book, by Charles W. Wood 

Illustrated by Art Young. (Price $1.00 

At his best, Charlie Wood makes people think; at his worst he makes them laugh. Here he is at his damn- 
dest. HURRAH FOR SIN! is the most intimate lot of revolutionary vaudeville you ever missed. It's the sort 
of stuff that no '' respectable " publisher would print and that every "respectable" person longs to read. Wood 
knows that eitWer he is crazy or the world is, and he has decided to make the best and funniest of It.

Here Is a book that is in every way a fresh contribution to poetry. BLUE SANDS is powerful, epic, and 
vivid. And, odd enough, it is written with a precision truly classic. It is an integration of the pagan spirit 
and the modern spirit. It has in it great surging rhythms, tossing and impetuous. The genius of Eliot Sara- 
sohn is many-sided. We believe that we have here a book remarkable in many ways, ono whose advent will 
not soon be forgotten.

"SOVIET RUSSIA" 

A Weekly 
Official Organ of the Russian Soviet Government Bureau, New York City 

T IP to the moment of the recent sensational defeats of the counter- 
*-r revolutionary forces under Kolchak and Denikin, there was 
danger of immediate recognition of Kolchak by the Entente Powers, 
as Supreme Ruler of Russia. This would have meant increased sup- 
port of the powers of reaction, and possibly open warfare on the part 
of the Entente against the Soviet Republic of Russia. And the friends 
of recognition for Kolchak are now only resting, ready to begin work 
as soon as another opportunity offers itself. 

" Soviet Russia " was founded to combat the enemies of the Soviet 
Government. It does this, not' so much by exposing their crimes, 
although in that direction much needs to be done, but chiefly by 
explaining the principles and the practice of the Saviet Government 
of Russia, which is supported by the great masses of the people of 
that country. Authentic information is thus made available for those 
who have lost faith in the unsupported rumors and charges that fill 
the columns of the daily press. 

" Soviet Russia " prints articles by prominent officials of the Soviet 
Government, by members of that Government's Bureau in New 
York, and by Americans and others who have traveled in Russia, 
and have an appreciative understanding of the great work that is 
being done there.

RUSSIA IN 1919 

by 

ARTHUR RANSOME 

The misinformation that has been ladled out to the American people has made the truth 
so rare as to be sensational. Mr. Ransome is one of the best known writers in England 
and a most trustworthy expert on Russian matters. His experience and ability dis- 
tinguish him from the personally-conducted, hand-picked reporters who " discovered " 
Russia as tourists used to discover Paris. 

HERE are personal interviews with Lenin and the heads of all important departments of 
the government; accounts of the meetings of Soviets and the Moscow Executive Com- 
mittee ; figures concerning schools, libraries, etc. ; prices of food and commodities ; facts 
about the conversion of private enterprises to communal control ; agriculture, transport, 
police, housing, trade unions, to say nothing of observations on the more personal as- 
pects of the miracle that the Russian people are valiantly working. 

PEN-PICTURES of the leaders ; what the people read ; the plays and operas given in a sin- 
gle fortnight in Moscow ; the primitive conditions that prevail ; the levelling of caste ; the 
permission required to buy a suit of clothes (if the purchaser happens to possess the for- 
tune that such a transaction involves) ; the government manoeuvres to circumvent food 
profiteers, and much other information is given.

\ FORTNIGHTLY 



I 



Kolchak's Backers 



N THE COURSE of the Russian debate, both the 
defenders and the opponents of the Kolchak Gov- 
ernment have exposed all their arguments. In some 
quarters the excitement has risen to such a pitch 
that diplomatic politeness has been forgotten and 
the American liberal press has been summarily 
characterized as "pro-German, ex-pacifist, and par- 
lor-Bolshevik." And yet all this fire has been 
kindled with fuel six months old. When these 
now-old facts were new, Siberia was in the grip of 
the "provisional and inevitable" civil war which 
followed Kolchak's coup d'etat. But today, in the 
larger part of Asiatic Russia, suppression has done 
its work and Kolchak is in power. Persons who 
are interested in knowing what Kolchak would 
do in Russia if he had his way may well ask: 
What is he doing now in Siberia? And above all: 
What interests must he conciliate? Who are his 
backers ? 

These questions have been so long a matter of 
controversy that I feel it is impossible to answer 
them abstractly and in general terms. ' What is 
wanted above all things is facts and it is facts 
rather than generalizations that I hope to supply. 
What support, then, does Kolchak claim and 
what alliances does he acknowledge in the mili- 
tary, 'economic, and political fields? And what is 
the actual value of the claim in each case? 

The allied world has been given to understand 
that Kolchak has the support of an enthusiastic * 
Russian army enlisted for the crusade against the 
Bolsheviki. In this connection a sentence from an 
rder issued by General Haida to Kolchak's troops 
on the Ural front may be of interest. "It is a 
shame," says the order, "that our soldiers desert to 
and unite with the Reds." These defections no 
doubt contributed to the agility of Kolchak's "stra- 
tegic retreat" from the advanced positions he at 
one time occupied in European Russia. 

Military weakness is no novelty to the anti-Bol- 
shevik forces. Now as always their main support 
is the Allies. The aim of the great powers has 
been clear from the first to those who know what 
is actually occurring in Russia. They want to 
crush the Russian Revolution because a revolu- 



tionary Russia endangers the putrid economic and 
political organisms of the allied countries. Eng- 
land fears that the free spirit of revolution in 
Russia will cross the borders of Turkestan and 
come into India. France wants to include South 
Russia within her sphere of influence in the Near 
East and to have an entirely free hand in disin- 
tegrated Turkey. At first the center of the French 
"zone " of South Russia was Kiev; after the occupa- 
tion of Kiev by the Germans, the French head- 
quarters was transferred to Yassy, in Roumania. 
England was established at Archangel in the North. 
Japan controlled Manchuria and the eastern part 
of Siberia. 

In the Southern zone the official representative 
of the Allies was the French General Tabouit. 
Captain Hennaut was chief economic investigator 
for the region. This French captain labored cease- 
lessly to make Yassy a center of the Russian coun- 
ter-revolution, organized under the banner of anti- 
Bolshevism. In November and December 1918 
a conference of Russians was held at Yassy, 
Roumania, under the leadership of Paul Miliou- 
kof and Sergius Sazonof. A short time after 
this, Sazonof appeared in Paris and announced 
himself as representative of Denikin, and after- 
wards as emissary of Kolchak also. During the 
occupation of Odessa by the Allies, Captain Hen- 
naut was the official diplomatic representative of 
the Powers in that unfortunate city. He was con- 
stantly in communication with the prominent mon- 
archists who had left Bolshevist Russia and gathered 
in the South at Kiev, Rostof, and Ekaterinodar, and 
was particularly intimate with the reactionary 
"Shoulgin, who, in the columns of his own paper 
Kievlianin, had refused openly to support any form 
of constitutional assembly. When Captain Hen- 
naut was in Kiev in January 1918, he said in the 
course of a conversation with the author: "I see 
and know Russia. She is not ready for a republican 
form of government. The best thing for her is a 
monarchy." He knew at the time that I was aware 
of his official position, but he made no effort to con- 
ceal his monarchist leanings. 

Monarchist activities were also being fostered

THE DIAL 



August 9 



by England at this time. Narodnoye Dielo, the 
Social-Revolutionist paper of Kiev, received from 
a reliable source the report that the post of Com- 
mander-in-chief of all the anti-Bolshevist forces 
had been offered to Grand Duke Michail Alexand- 
rovich, brother of the Tsar. This choice was made 
under English influence and was highly acceptable 
to the British because of the well known Anglophil 
tendencies of this Romanoff. The Grand Duke 
refused the proffered position, and for a time 
the Allies waited. 

Then came Kolchak. General Boldyriov, the Si- 
berian commander-in-chief of the anti-Bolshevist 
forces, refused to subordinate himself to Kolchak, 
considering him a usurper. The old General was 
summarily dismissed. Democratic Siberia organ- 
ized a strong body of opposition to Kolchak, but the 
reactionaries who had been silent for two and a 
half years now had the active support of the 
Allies, and Omsk soon became a center of tri- 
umphant counter-revolution. Without even a pre- 
tense of an election or of the formation of a popular 
government, Denikin declared the allegiance of 
South Russia to Kolchak. As a matter of fact the 
union of South Russia and Siberia is only the union 
of the Anglo-French alliance. 

Kolchak's troops are so untrustworthy that he 
has been obliged to depend upon the Japanese and 
even on Italians for his main support. The com- 
mander Kalmikov, who is now under Kolchak's con- 
trol, refers in his Order No. 7 to "the glorious 
ranks of the Japanese armies, fighting shoulder to 
shoulder with our soldiers." In a Siberian paper, 
along .with reports of Bolshevist atrocities, we read 
Order No. 8, posted at Vierino Station, May 30, 
1919: "Do not take any prisoners!" (Dalnievos- 
tochnoye Obozrienye, June 8, 1919.) But even 
with the aid of such methods and such allies, Kol- 
chak has not yet triumphed everywhere in Siberia. 
Fighting is in progress all along the Usourry rail- 
way, and a number of stations on this line are in 
the hands of anti-Kolchak forces. Because of this 
condition the reports of Kolchak's staff are divided 
into two parts, the first referring to the Western 
or Soviet front, the qther to the internal front of 
Eastern Siberia. Even the anti-Bolshevist Cossacks 
are an element of discord. Their conference in 
Chita in May and June refused to send a pledge of 
support to Kolchak. The Dalnievostochnoye Oboz- 
rienye, published in Vladivostok under the Kolchak 
censorship, made the following announcement in 
this connection: "... for certain reasons we 
are unable to publish reports of the Chita Cossack 
conference." The reasons are not far to seek. 

In fact the exercise of censorship in this instance 
is symptomatic of what is happening wherever Kol- 



chak is in control. Siberia has "been carefully 
cleared of all the leaders of moderate Socialism. 
Those who had the luck to remain alive after 
Kolchak's massacres are now in Paris, where, under 
the leadership of Kerensky, they are working 
against Kolchak and publishing an anti-Kolchak 
paper, La Republique Russe. The moderate Demo- 
crats in Siberia are obliged to keep silence, and their 
paper Daliokaya Okrayna has been stopped. This 
newspaper existed for thirteen years; it endured the 
terrible Tzarist reaction of 1910, 'n and '12, but 
it could not be tolerated under the reaction of Kol- 
chak. In Irkutsk, according to the paper Coopera- 
tivenoye Dyelo, a bookstore was raided and some 
works of Andreyev and Tolstoy were confiscated. 
The title of Tolstoy's objectionable book was On 
the Tzar's Power. Liberty of the press appears 
thus to be very highly developed under the "free 
and democratic " Omsk government. 

In the economic field Kolchak claims the support 
of two strangely incongruous groups the captains 
of industry and the cooperative societies. The first 
he has bought at a heavy price. But his claim of 
friendly relations with the cooperative movement 
is entirely groundless. 

At the time when political and social initiative 
were completely suppressed by the Tsar, there were 
already developing in Russia numerous economic 
organizations of the greatest importance the coop- 
erative societies. These organizations, with the 
town councils and the provincial Zemstvo assem- 
blies, represented during the revolution the spirit of 
real democracy in industry and in politics. During 
the revolution the cooperative societies, because of 
their enlightened policy and economic strength, 
gained greatly in power. But allied capitalism and 
Siberian autocracy could not tolerate either the 
councils or the cooperative societies, and Kolchak 
very soon found means of clearing out the demo- 
cratic elements in both. 

Throughout their history the cooperatives have 
been purely economic organizations; they have al- 
ways refused to become involved in political con- 
troversies. However, a little group of politicians 
is now pretending to speak in the name of the co- 
operative societies, pledging the movement to sup- 
port the Omsk Government. The activities of this 
group and the utterances of its organ, the Zaria of 
Omsk, were repudiated by the most important co- 
operative organization in Siberia, the Zukupzbyt, in 
a statement published in the Golos Primoria of 
Vladivostok, June 12, 1919. In spite of this fact 
some men now in the United States are trying to 
play a political role in the name of the cooperative 
societies. One of them, Mr. Bashkyrof, so far as 
I know was never connected with the cooperatives 



1919

in Russia but was always a rich owner of mills. 
However he has signed, as a representative of the 
cooperative movement, a published resolution in 
favor of Kolchak this in spite of the fact that he 
represents only the small group above referred to. 
Another man by the name of Okulich, claiming to 
represent the Siberian cooperatives, is staying in 
Washington and working for the Kolchak interests. 
About eight months ago this same Okulich was in 
London, where he formed a close connection with 
the London Supply Company, an organization 
formed last year, on the model of the famous East 
India Company, to monopolize the exploitation of 
Russia. When Okulich's connections were learned, 
all the representatives of Russian Cooperatives then 
in England unanimously, without any voice of pro- 
test, cabled the Siberian Committee to remove him. 
He was compelled to leave England. And now he 
has appeared again in the United States, where he, 
with Bashkyrof and others is operating under the 
name of the All-Siberian Cooperative Union. 

Mr. A. M. Berkenheim, Vice-President of the 
All-Russian Cooperative Union, is now in the 
United States. This officer, representing the legiti- 
mate Russian cooperative movement, has issued to 
the press a statement repudiating the actions of 
the representatives of the so-called All-Siberian 
organization and asserting that the cooperative 
societies in Russia are not concerned with political 
issues. Many American papers have published the 
pro-Kolchak matter sent out by Bashkyrof, et al., 
but only one journal The New York Call saw 
fit to print Mr. Berkenheim's statement. 

The position of the captains of industry in the 
area controlled by Kolchak may be characterized in 
a very few words they are in the pay of "the new 
dictator. In an address to the big business men of 
the Ural region, Kolchak said: 

I find it necessary to create a body that is in its nature 
a state institution on which will depend all the industrial 
activities of the region. This body, comprising the lead- 
ing men of industry, will determine the needs of the 
state, and in particular, those of the army. It will know 
the facilities and productive power of the factories and 
undertakings, and will empower the carrying out of or- 
ders at its direction and under its control. . . . You will 
furthermore solve the question of regular financial assist- 
ance to be given in industrial enterprises. 

Thus, at the time when England, France, Italy, 
and the United States are seriously facing the ques- 
tion of the role of labor in the task of reconstruc- 
tion, Kolchak gives all power into the hands of 
Russia's profiteers. He has put the workmen aside 
because that political element is a hindrance to the 
working of his machine. 

But Kolchak did not stop with the authorization 
of unlimited exploitation by private interests. He 
subsidized these interests. A bulletin of the Russian 



Liberation Committee of London reports the loans 
advanced by the Kolchak government during the 
period of January-April, 1919, as follows: 

Roubles 

Industries 135,000,000 

Railways 84,000,000 

Towns and Zemstvos 25,000,000 

Kolchak Armies 53,000,000 

Cooperative Societies 32,000,000 

Private Banks 110,000,000 

The total revenue of the government for this 
period was 466,000,000 roubles. t 

Thus capitalists received 29.4 per cent of the 
total revenue, while the cooperatives received seven 
per cent and the towns and Zemstvos only three 
per cent each. 

What were the sources of the revenue so equitably 
distributed by the Kolchak Government? The 
bulletin above referred to supplied the necessary 
information. It says: 

According to information given by the Minister of Finance, 
the financial situation is improving. 

RECEIPTS FOR JANUARY-APRIL, 1919 

Roubles 

Spirit Monopoly (vodka) 127,500,000 

Railways 124,000,000 

Excise 56,000,000 

and so forth. 

The basis of Siberian public finance is the state 
monopoly of vodka. In order that the party of the 
capitalistic bourgeoisie and the feudals may rule, 
the people must be drunk. That was the method 
of Nicholas II. It is the method of Kolchak. 

Besides allied diplomats, Japanese troops, and 
purely Russian vodka, Kolchak has now the Con- 
stitutional Democratic, or "Cadet," Party. It was 
this party that formed, with the Octobrists and the 
Extreme Right, the Progressive Bloc which came 
into control of the Duma shortly after the outbreak 
of the war, and it was a ministry of this Bloc 
headed by Prince Lvoff, that later shouted the im- 
perialisms of Milioukov until the triumph of 
Kerensky put a period to this clamor. 

Ten or eleven years ago the Cadets posed as 
liberals fighting against the autocracy for a limited 
monarchy, which was even then the ultimate goal 
of their political program. They supported 
Nicholas' minister Sazonof, who is now the repre- 
sentative of Kolchak and Denikin at Paris, because 
of his imperialistic program and especially because 
of his attitude on the Polish question. Three or 
four months ago, the French journal Humanite 
published one of Sazonof 's secret notes, sent in 1915, 
urging the annexation of Poland (German and Aus- 
trian parts included) to the Russian Tzardom. 
As a sharer in the idea of Pan-Slavic imperialism, 
the Cadet party was the main obstacle to the full 
development of the revolution. Its aspirations for 



90

August 9 



the conquest of Constantinople and Galicia were 
constantly opposed by the Socialists and the Sol- 
diers' and Workmen's Councils, proponents of a 
democratic peace. The Provisional Government 
was thus kept in a state of perpetual crisis. 

After the peace of Brest-Li to vsk, the southern 
committee of the Cadet party, with the approval 
of the central committee, supported the counter- 
revolution in Ukrainia, and took part in the gov- 
ernment of General Skoropadsky, the leader of this 
movement. As representatives of the Cadet party, 
Vasilienko, Kistiakovsky and Goutnik held port- 
folios in Skoropadsky's cabinet. Milioukov was 
also at that time (May, June, July 1918) in Kiev, 
the capital of the counter-revolution. 

Today the same party supports Kolchak. They 
were forced by the Russian collapse to abandon their 
imperialistic aims, but they still want political power. 
All the old "dark forces" that dared not work 
under the Tzarist banner during the revolution 
have made the best of it and have entered the 
Cadet organization. One of the Cadets, Professor 
Veinberg, stated frankly in the Siberian District 
Duma that the Russian people want a Tzar. The 
ultra-moderate Dalrrievostochnaye Obozrienye of 
June 12, 1919, gives the following characterization 
of the Cadet party of today: 

The clearly expressed ideas of old-time Cadetism are 
now deformed. New commonplace elements which came 
in since the revolution have mixed all the old political 
cards. The Cadetism of today is a conglomerate of differ- 
ent elements: there are liberals and octobrists and mon- 
archists and simply average men, who are dreaming of an 
iron power. It makes a very bad impression. 

The latest congress of the party, held May I 
in Omsk, adopted a resolution in favor of Kolchak, 
which declared that "concerning the principles of 
foreign policy the party preserves the spirit of its 
traditional view . . . All nations must 
unite in righting for the right and for civilization" 
(Bulletin of the Russian Liberation Committee, 
London, June 7, 1918). Now as always it is the 
"traditional view" of imperialism that menaces 
Russia. The resolution says further: "We must 
firmly assert that neither in political nor in social 
question there can be any talk of return to the old 
regime." Political return means Nicholas II. 
Certainly nobody thinks of that. But the party re- 
mains true to the idea of a limited monarchy, while 
its social program permits it to support a govern- 
ment financed in part by the vodka monopoly, and 
backed by Japanese troops. 

The Kolchak Government takes account of the 
fact that it must keep up appearances. Therefore, 
for propaganda's sake, it is always stated that 
Kolchak's Cabinet counts the most prominent 
liberal leaders. 



The value of Kolchak's ministers can be under- 
stood from the following illustrations. The Min- 
ister of Finance, Mr. Michailof, is a former So- 
cialist ; but even the moderate Mme. Breshko- 
Breshvovsky has characterized him as a renegade. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs a most important 
figure now at the climax of international combina- 
tions is a young man by the name of Soukin who 
was for some time a third secretary to the Tsarist 
Ambassador at Washington. This is all that can 
be learned about this prominent liberal former 
clerk of a Tzar's office. Kolchak's foreign policy 
is now guided by the Japanese General Otani, and 
the French and English Supreme Commissionaires, 
as they are called in the Siberian Press. For the 
execution of their orders a clerk is a great con- 
venience. 

As to Bielorussof, another Kolchak official, I am 
able to say that many years ago he was a moderate 
liberal ; however he is now a contributor to the reac- 
tionary paper Oteschestvienye Viedomosty. To him 
has been given the task of making preparations for 
the organization of the Constituent Assembly. The 
Siberian newspaper Eacho (June II, 1919) quotes 
from the Nash Ural the following characterization 
of Bielorussof: 

He did not receive any special instruction in state and 
administrative law. His appointment to prepare a law 
for the election of the Constituent Assembly can be ex- 
plained only on the ground that he has been converted 
[to a conservative point of view] in his old age. Now, 
in the period of renegades, it is very popular to be one of 
them. We can say in advance that his appointment is 
to be interpreted not as an effort to enforce democracy 
through the Constituent Assembly, but as an attempt to 
prepare for it a fine funeral. Not only his [Bielorussof's] 
hatred of the Socialists, but also his unfavorable treatment 
of all the organs of popular self-government [Zemstvos, 
Town Councils], reveals his hatred of the principles of the 
democratic organization of state power. All these things 
detract from the authoritativeness of the future assembly. 

In this connection it is perhaps worth while to call 
attention to a statement which appeared recently 
(July 12, 1919) in Struggling Russia, the Kolchak 
weekly now appearing in New York. This maga- 
zine says: "Among those who support Kolchak 
we find such prominent revolutionists and Socialists 
as Nicholas Tchaikovsky, Vladimir Bourtzev, 
Boris Savinkov," and so on. But they forget that 
Tschaikovsky has remained entirely alone, without 
any support from other Socialists, in the pro- 
Kolchak organization in Paris, acting for no party, 
without responsibility except to himself. They 
forget that this man, now seventy-seven years old, 
represents the Russian Socialists just as much as 
Clemenceau represents the French Communists of 
1870-71. They forget that Bourtzev does not 
belong to any Socialist party that he was reac- 
tionary even during the first period of the revolu- 



1919

tion, and now represents the spirit of Socialism 
even moderate Socialism exactly as much as Gus- 
tave Herve represents that of pacifism and anti- 
militarism. They forget that Savinkov was ex- 
pelled from the party for his reactionary intrigues 
as early as August 1917 (still under Kerensky), 
and that this ex-Socialist represents 'the Russian 
revolution just as much as the renegade Jacobin 
Foushet represented the French revolution when 
he acted as Minister of Police under Napoleon. 

Besides the Cadets and certain renegade Social- 
ists, Kolchak counts among his political supporters 
a third and very important group made up of cer- 
tain elements of the Orthodox Church. Today the 
theocratic clergy have again begun to play upon the 
religious instincts of the masses. The Kolchak 
military attache General Nikolaiev published in the 
New York Times for July 18, 1919, a statement 
to the effect that the patriotic and religious spirit 
is arising in the Siberian armies. The Metropoli- 
tan Platon has recently come to the United States 
for the purpose of organizing a body of church sup- 
port for Kolchak. Simultaneously with the arrival 
of this new emissary, the Kolchak propagandists 
have begun to use with great fervor the word 
" religious." 

In an interview granted shortly after his arrival 
in the United States, Metropolitan Platon ooenly 
warned the American Jewry that pogroms are pos- 
sible if Kolchak does not become sufficiently power- 
ful to prevent them. Afterwards,* desiring to remove 
the bad impression created by his involuntary frank- 
ness, he explained that he had always been a friend 
of the Jews and that in 1905 in Kiev he stopped a 
mob of 20,000 persons about to enter upon a 
pogrom. This statement should be corrected. 

Platon is a personality of the old regime, very 
well known in Russia as an active anti-Semite and 
Tzarist. In this respect he does not differ from 
Bishop Evloguy and Metropolitan Pitirim, who 
were appointed by the Tzar to> high church posts 
because of their extreme friendship for the 
Romanoffs. As to the affair in Kiev, it would be 



fitting for this Christian clergyman to confess pub- 
licly in deep Christian resjgnation that he has 
changed his opinions since 1905, if indeed he has. 
But the Metropolitan prefers to forget the deeds 
of thirteen years ago. 

I happen to have had 'the unfortunate opportunity 
to witness personally how the Archbishop Platon 
protected the Jews of Kiev in 1905. His protec- 
tion was as serviceable as that of the Governor- 
General Kleiguels. For four days and. four nights 
the Jews were robbed, beaten, killed. The soldiers 
of Kleiguels supported the rioters, who carried the 
standards of the church as they went out to mas- 
sacre the Jews. But Platon has forgotten all these 
things now or perhaps he thinks that no one in 
America can remember 'those times. 

Like the Metropolitan Platon, Mr. Kovalsky, a 
contributor to the magazine Struggling Russia, is 
very solicitous for the fate of the Jews. In his 
appeal to the American Jewry he suggests that the 
trouble that threatens may be avoided if financial 
aid is granted to Kolchak. Indeed, his predictions 
of what may happen if this aid is not granted sound 
very like a warning! 

Such then, is the support of Kolchak. For mili- 
tary power he depends largely on the Japanese. 
His economic supporters are the sudsidized 
profiteers and a few discredited emissaries who 
claim to represent the cooperative movement. His 
chief internal source of revenue is the restored : 
vodka monopoly. His political strength consists in 
imperialist Cadets, reactionary and anti-Semite 
clergy, and renegade Socialists now unknown to 
their party. But, after all, the rulers of Europe 
do not care very much. With casuist indifference 
to means, they go systematically about the business 
of crushing the one threatening economic organism 
remaining on the continent' after Germany's col- 
lapse an organism that threatens the other nations, 
hot with mercantilistic competition, out with the 
infection of industrial democracy.

Washington and Lincoln 



EVER SINCE ANY OF us was born did the study 
of history have an appeal so strong as today. It is 
impossible to write history, since the summer of 
1914, or to read it, without feeling especially that 
we are groping after the laws of a fate that may 
be a power that " makes for righteousness " ; or 
may not. 

The relation of biography to history will for- 
ever be seen differently by different minds. An 
artist in portraiture will star the protagonists. 
One who feels himself an adept in generalizing 
about masses will stress environment, trend, and 
mob psychology. It happens that in the series of 
Chronicles of America, being put out by the Yale 
Press, the two volumes dealing with our two great- 
est Americans approach history with different 
emphasis. Professor Henry James Ford, in Wash- 
ington and His Colleagues, is downright and defi- 
nite, and somewhat distrustful, I take it, of a Freud- 
ian interpretation of history. Professor Nathaniel W. 
Stephenson, in Abraham Lincoln and the Union, 
is rather severe with the obvious and would teach 
us that things are not what they seem. The former 
naturally emphasizes individual leadership 'more 
than the latter. Fortunately the eras chosen fit the 
contrasting points of view. Whatever Tolstoi did 
to Napoleon in Wai- and Peace, even that Russian 
genius would have found it rather difficult 
to tell the story of Washington's time without giv- 
ing distinctly creative roles ' to Washington and to 
Hamilton. It is much more possible to discuss the 
Civil War period in terms of groups and under- 
currents and psychological niceties. Mr. Stephen- 
son says: 

The old days when the American Civil War was con- 
ceived as a clear-cut issue are as a watch in the night 
that has passed, and we now realize that historical move- 
ments are almost without exception the resultants of many 
motives. We have come to recognize that men have 
always misapprehended themselves, contradicted them- 
selves, obeyed primal impulses, and then deluded them- 
selves with sophistications upon the springs of action. . . . 
We are prone to forget that we act from subconscious 
quite as often as from conscious influences, from motives 
that arise out of the dim parts of our being, from the 
midst of shadows that psychology has only recently begun 
to lift, where senses subtler than the obvious make use of 
fear, intuition, prejudice, habit, and illusion, and too often 
play with us as the wind with blown leaves. 

Professor Ford's manner is indicated by this: 

The prevailing tone of public life was one of dull and 
narrow provincialism, at times thickening into stupidity, 
at times sharpening into spite, although ordinarily made 
respectable by a serious attitude to life and by a solid 
fortitude in facing whatever the distracted times might 



present. It was the influence of a few great men that 
made America a nation. ... A mistake might have been 
fatal to the existence of the government. It has become 
so powerful and massive since that time that we can 
hardly realize what a rickety "structure it then was, and 
how readily, in less capable hands, it might have col- 
lapsed. 

Mr. Stephenson's descriptions of the American 
people are ambitious. They include all time and 
even points of exclamation. " Americans have 
always been the slaves of phrases!" See Mephis- 
topheles on the power of words, in Faust, where 
Americans are not specified. " Democracies are 
mercurial!" See recent newspapers on changes 
in Russia and Germany. " Greeley was a type of 
American that no European can understand: he 
believed in talk, and more talk, and still more talk, 
as the cure for earthly ills." No European? 
Shades of the Gauls and Slavs! 

However, regardless of whether the historian's 
mouthful is masticable or not, there is something 
wholesome in a protest against conventionalized his- 
tory. The actual "no; no; not a sixpence" is to 
a ripe taste more interesting than the Fourth of 
July forms about millions for defense and not one 
cenf for tribute. The Washington of Weems died 
hard, but when it died it left a nobler figure. Lin- 
coln himself is on record with a disdainful remark 
about biographies whose heroes are interchangeably 
perfect. And populations are no more immune than 
heroes. Vox populi vox del needs a good deal of 
explaining to make it satisfactory, as the strongest 
leaders have realized. When the Jay treaty was 
being negotiated George Washington was called 
an incapable general, an embezzling President, and 
the stepfather of his country, with enough persis- 
tence to make him say he would rather be in his 
grave than in the presidency. The general dis- 
ruptive spirit is indicated by the fact that as late 
as when Washington was inaugurated Rhode Island 
and North Carolina were still outside the union. 
The new constitution was, in the Virginia Con- 
vention of 1788, called a scheme of the military 
men to subject the people to their rule. Leading 
the people forward is never a sinecure. Lincoln 
endured more injustice than Washington, although 
he did not face as heavy difficulties. The people's 
opinion of Lincoln in 1862 was indicated by the 
loss of 33 seats in Congress. Lincoln acted against 
the bitterest national wishes in the Trent affair, as 
Washington did in the Jay treaty. Perhaps if there 
is anybody now living who thinks the public is 
always admirable the most disagreeable reading for

him would be the private correspondence of 
George Washington. The two greatest Ameri- 
cans interpreted the people profoundly but both of 
them found frequent occasions to defy the mood of 
the moment. They both had that bigness of soul 
that makes such defiance easy, because it makes the 
accidents of personal success of small importance. 
Both lived in lonely isolation, Lincoln expressing 
his loneliness like a poet, Washington remaining 
inexpressive like an impassive mountain. 

No longer is Washington first in the hearts of 
his countrymen. Lincoln, secure in that place, 
belongs there, because men live little in their judg- 
ments, much in their sentiments. Lincoln was a 
very great man; Washington was an even greater; 
but Lincoln lived and expressed the sorrows, the 
longings, the humor of us all, and the abilities and 
character of Washington are not easy of approach. 
There is a Father Abraham, but no Father George. 
The author of the Gettysburg address, the Second 
Inaugural, the letter to the woman who had lost 
five sons, was an inspired artist. The antagonist 
of Douglas was a matchless debater. The man 
around whose gigantic figure the American nation 
was formed is not romantic and he is not to a high 
degree articulate, there is in the actual Washington 
little to reach the sentimental soul. Professor Ford 
says of him : " He had a well-balanced nature 
which was never disturbed by timidity of any kind 
and rarely by anxiety. His anger was strong when 
it was excited, but his ordinary disposition was one 
of massive equanimity." It was a nature fit for 
bearing the greatest load ever carried by an Amer- 
ican, but it was not a nature to become the aspira- 
tion and the consolation of average men. 

Of course Lincoln's felicity in expression- would 
not have carried him to the heights, had he not 
performed great acts. It was with splendid self- 
control that he put into the Cabinet a man who had 
bitterly insulted him in his humble days, and it is 
that magnanimous control that gives the charm to 
what Lincoln said on a later occasion. " Did Stan- 
ton tell you I was a fool? Then I expect I must 
be one, for he is almost always right." Sometimes 
the patience is humorous, sometimes infinitely 
grave. Listen to the tone of this plea for emancipa- 
tion by purchase : " I do not argue. I beseech 
you to make arguments for yourselves. You can- 
not, if you would, be blind to the signs of the 
times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged considera- 
tion of them, ranging, if it may be, far above per- 
sonal and partisan politics. This proposal makes 
common cause for % a common object, casting no re- 
proaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The 



change it contemplates would come gently as the 
dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. 
Will you not embrace it?" Never was the style 
more a reflection of the man. He was what Ham- 
let saw: 

As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing; 
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards 
Hath taken with equal thanks. . . . 

Few great leaders have been so free from pride, 
that attribute which, " howe'er disguised in its own 
majesty, is littleness." He never went further in 
self-appreciation than to say that the Convention 
had decided that he was " not so poor a horse that 
they might not make a botch of it in trying to 
swap." This intellectual and moral purity, this 
absence of all pettiness, is the lure that never fails 
in Lincoln. But his charm is one thing, his his- 
torical record another. What made him the leader 
of the nation, and solidified his leadership, was his 
brains. It was the house-divided-against-itself posi- 
tion, and the defense of it; the Cooper Union 
speech, including its condemnation of John Brown; 
the reply to Greeley on emancipation; the combina- 
tion of vision with judgment. Not only has his 
personality won the world. It is also true that his 
judgment has so impressed us that we daily guess 
at what his views would be. As to his standards, 
I will merely quote these words: "The resources, 
advantages, and power of the American people are 
very great, and they have consequently succeeded 
to very great responsibilities." 

Possibly some poet-historian will some time draw 
a portrait that will make us feel Washington as 
definitely as we feel Lincoln; but I doubt if it can 
be done. There is not the intimacy. There is only 
size, strength, security. From his boyhood almost 
to his death he was put in positions of responsibil- 
ity and he never failed. Before he was made Com- 
mander-in-Chief he had already established his 
reputation as the man of weightiest judgment among 
men remarkable for their gifts. During the war 
the feeble colonies, whether in the army, the legis- 
lature, or civil life, drew their strength from him. 
In founding the new nation, in launching it, in 
meeting the perils of its first years Washington 
was the one to dominate, to unify, to give direction. 
For him the most brilliant minds of all kinds 
worked. Men like Jefferson and Madison followed 
him, along with those like Hamilton and Jay. No 
American has ever collected nearly as much ability 
around him as Washington, or guided it with such 
Olympian strength. Even looking at world-history 
we can almost say literally, with Byron, " there was 

but one." XT

Revolution and Reform in Italian Labor 



A HE GENERAL STRIKE, proposed for July 21 in 
France, England, and Italy was an effort on the 
part of labor leaders to reconstruct, over the dog- 
matic differences that have divided the revolu- 
tionary leaders since 1914, the new International 
on the basis of joint action. It was distinctly an 
affair of the leaders a strike with a purpose. That 
it did not materialize with any great effectiveness 
was an issue to be expected. Since the date of the 
attempt had been twice postponed in the interests of 
greater coordination of the international leadership, 
the element of popular enthusiasm was largely ab- 
sent, having spent itself already in a number of 
important local manifestations. Moreover the 
failure of the Italians to secure at Southampton the 
acceptance on the part of the French and English 
organizations of the principle of coordinate leader- 
ship, approved at the conference- of Milan, with the 
resulting fact that each national group was left to 
act autonomously, deprived the whole movement of 
the grandeur on which reliance had been placed to 
move the popular imagination. With the English 
standing aside to cultivate their own garden, the 
French were glad to find in slight ministerial alter- 
ations an excuse to avoid the issue. This left the 
Italian movement hanging in suspense. 

Since the Nitti ministry assumed power on the 
issue of the internal question, which the Orlando 
cabinet had been neglecting to no visible advantage 
in fayor of the international problem, the nation 
has been in a mood of expectancy for adequate 
measures of relief. Reliance on Nitti's economic 
shrewdness has created a feeling of optimism in 
many quarters formerly disaffected. With some 
show of seriousness, Mr. Nitti repeated promises of 
amnesty for political prisoners, more effective re- 
straint by price regulation on profiteering, and 
hastening of demobilization, all of which were de- 
mands in the strike program. It was reported also, 
on the eve of the general strike, that the Govern- 
ment would withdraw its cooperation with the 
Entente policy in Siberia and Hungary, and cease 
using Italian troops and Italian instruments of 
supply to further the campaigns against the prole- 
tarian governments in the East. These announce- 
ments were in the line of conceding in advance the 
demands which the strike was to make. And they 
seem to have placated especially the newcomers in 
labor organizations from the petty bourgeois classes, 
such as the school teachers, and the higher clerks of 
the governmental departments. From the moment 
when the Railway Federation and the Seamen's 
Union voted to abstain from striking, a general 



paralysis of the country became out of the question. 
And what was intended to be a general strike for 
two days actually turned out to be a series of local 
disturbances of less extent than the spontaneous 
food protests of two weeks before. 

Viewed from the inside of the Italian movement, 
this abortive attempt indicates that the Italian So- 
cialist and Labor organizations have not as yet 
effected that complete return to contact with the 
masses which has been the unifying effort of official 
policy for the last eight months. To make this 
essential point clear one great misconception must 
be removed. 

Belief in the imminence of an Italian revolution 
has had only one solid fact to go on : the undoubted 
existence of the revolutionary spirit in important 
contingents of Italian labor. For the rest that be- 
lief has been allowed to persist largely because of 
its utility to all sides in the diplomatic game dur- 
ing the war and at the peace conference. During 
1917 the Italian Government attributed to Socialist 
propaganda the low popular morale resulting from 
cold, hunger, and war-weariness; and the food riots 
of Turin were made the pretext for imprisoning 
socialist leaders. To disguise the ministerial ineffi- 
ciency and the military blunders resulting in 
Caporetto, the legend of a vast revolutionary in- 
trigue behind the lines was invented and made the 
burden of orthodox Allied propaganda in all coun- 
tries. The danger of revolution was capitalized by 
the Italian Government in 1918 to support its de- 
mand for Allied military assistance; for a major 
offensive on the Italian front to create a fait 
accompli for use at the Peace Conference ; for a 
" united financial front " to export a portion of the 
Italian war debt to the United States; and, during 
1919, for material economic concessions to Italy in 
Africa and the Near East, and for the recognition 
of the Italian major " aspirations." The same 
threat has been of service to France and England in 
keeping Italy in third place in the imperialistic and 
economic grand march. Had the Allied govern- 
ments really believed in an Italian social upheaval, 
they would have postponed their programs in for- 
eign export trade to give necessary relief to Italy. 
Instead it has been more profitable to keep Italy on 
the ragged edge of starvation and in economic in- 
action to control her the better by the threat of 
withholding financial and economic relief. Corol- 
lary to this policy has been the stress laid by the 
foreign press on Italian internal weakness. People 
have believed in an Italian revolution because the 
same agencies which minimize revolutionary activi- 



1919

ties elsewhere have been taking upheavals in Italy 
for granted. How artificial the resulting impres- 
sion has been may be illustrated by the example 
that around May I an Italian revolution was being 
predicted abroad at a time when the Italian sub- 
versive organizations were breaking all precedents 
by coming to a written treaty of arbitration with 
the Italian Association of Manufacturers, and after 
the moderates had been winning by two to one in 
every resolution of the Italian radical organizations 
for five months. The same artificial atmosphere 
influenced foreign press reactions to the disturb- 
ances that became more frequefit in Italy with the 
month of April; and even the radical press abroad 
began to take each movement as the initial blow in 
the expected revolutionary effort. These disturb- 
ances may indeed have contained the revolutionary 
germ ; but the maturation of the germ depended on 
elements which were unknown to everybody and 
which the Italian official organizations were bending 
every effort to evaluate. 

The consistent attitude of the Italian Socialist 
Party and the General Federation of Labor in op- 
position to the war had been for three years a 
matter of grave concern to all the Allied cabinets. 
That attitude was all the more ominous from the 
fact that no one, not even the revolutionists, knew' 
exactly how much force was behind it. The posi- 
tion of the "official" Socialist leadership (a standing 
committee of not more than twenty men and 
women) was exactly identical in its relation to 
the labor masses, with that of the different govern- 
ments in relation to their various national publics. 
Just as since 1914 the governments have been act- 
ing independently of their respective constituencies, 
so the Italian labor organizations have been cut off, 
by mobilization, from the workers they used to rep- 
resent. Incident to the passing of the workers 
under arms and to the great translocations of labor 
to the large industrial centers, came a disintegration 
of the pre-war structure of Italian labor. In these 
conditions it was as easy for the " labor cabinet " 
to be consistent as it has been for the national 
governments to be inconsistent. The attitude 
of the "official" group in Italy was a magnificent 
gesture, a grandiloquent pose on the part of a few 
people, forced only to agree on virtual non-essentials 
among themselves. Mr. Turati, Mr. Lazzari, Mr. 
Lodovico d'Aragona, and their friends, viewed the 
war as something like a rainstorm. They retired 
to Party Headquarters till it should be over, and 
there they discussed the theoretical relationships 
of Marxism to war, gave out proclamations of de- 
fiance to militarism, drew up peace programs in op- 
position to the various "notes" of the belligerents, 
and in general spoke with an orthodoxy all the 



purer because it was not called upon to meddle 
with any of the complexities of action. 

The Italian "official" leaders approved the 
"peace offensives" of Zimmerwald and Kienthal. 
They expelled from their councils those of their 
number who took up the war; and these heretics 
went off and formed on paper a new organiza- 
tion of their own, to represent, in a pro-war sense, 
"the [unexpressed] majority will of Italian labor in 
arms." In due course the official leaders refused 
to speak to Mr. Gompers, who had gone to Italy 
for the summer social season, and they had a warm 
argument with Mr. Spargo as to whether Karl 
Marx would have supported the war. They ap- 
proved as a matter of routine the five hundred odd 
strikes which occurred in various establishments, 
for increased wages, for shorter hours and better 
conditions of living. They heckled the author- 
ities of the prefectures in those centers where the 
elections of 1913 had instituted Socialist local gov- 
ernments. They continued to work on their pro- 
grams for social reforms, and on their scientific in- 
vestigations of industrial and agrarian questions. 
The Parliamentary group in the Chamber said "I 
told you so" to every Allied reverse and threw cold 
water on every patriotic rejoicing in victory. The 
intellectual character of the "official" organization 
agitation may be illustrated with reference to 
Russia. The leaders approved the Miliukoff revo- 
lution; then the Kerensky revolution; and finally 
the Bolshevik revolution, the moment the Allies de- 
clared against it. All this, to the patriots of war, 
looked like a gigantic conspiracy fomented by Ger- 
man money to sabotage the Italian war effort. The 
statements of the Party itself are more accurately 
descriptive of this policy, as an effort to keep the 
Socialist organization alive and coherent in it 
class struggle principles under the adverse condi- 
tions of war. Hence aloofness from a conflict 
originated by the middle classes and being fought 
for the realization of middle-class ideals; but also, 
avoidance, obeying a recommendation of Marx, 
of any overt acts which might wreck proletarian 
organization on the fundamental nationalistic emo- 
tions most rife in wartime. 

Now with the Armistice came again the oppor- 
tunity for action, but action in what direction and 
with what immediate goal ? It must be remembered 
that in June 1914 the "red" provinces of Italy, 
Romagna and the Legations, with the industrial 
centers of the Lombardo-Veneto, were in virtual 
revolution a spontaneous uprising under syndi- 
calist auspices on the soil impregnated with the old 
republicanism of 1848 revised according to Bakunin. 
That revolution, which proclaimed republics 
soviet before the fact and in truth gained control

for a day or two of the administrative mechanisms 
of the state, was the sequel to a period of Socialist 
obstructionism in Parliament on the question of dis- 
tributing taxation to pay the debts of the Italo- 
Turkish war. The uprising occurred, however, 
against the will of the labor organizations, which 
gave only tardy adherence to it. Nevertheless it 
revealed that organizations controlling at the out- 
side four hundred thousand members, could, under 
favorable circumstances, develop support of nearly 
two millions of workers in a single region of the 
country. That revolution failed because of its 
spontaneous tumultuous character, and its lack, 
after all, of a truly revolutionary orientation. 
When the Syndicalists gained the power they had 
not the slightest idea what to do with it. The 
tumult subsided as suddenly as it had grown, and 
mobilization beginning after the episode of Sarajevo 
postponed a fight to the finish on the Italian social 
question. 

Certain elements in the Socialist-Labor groups 
professed to believe that the proletarian spirit of 
1914 had been preserved through four years of war. 
Last November they were pointing out in addition 
that the Russian example had furnished method 
and object to the submerged revolutionary spirit of 
the workers that the end of the war would furnish 
the opportunity for overthrowing the established 
order, and substituting for it the organizations of 
the workers themselves. This feeling was some- 
what tempered as it passed into statements of policy 
by what proved to be a minority of the leadership. 
There it became simply an "outlook toward the 
left," propaganda, that is, for an immediate 
revolution, for the creation of a proletarian army to 
seize power. The majority program opposing this 
view was stated somewhat as follows: "Assuming 
no responsibility for war, the Italian proletariat 
will assume likewise no responsibility for peace. 
We cannot afford to take the tasks of reconstruc- 
tion which the middle-class governments have 
created for themselves." In other words, no revo- 
lution for the economic isolation of Italy makes 
that impossible but reconsolidation of labor forces, 
to gain specific necessary improvements in wages, 
working hours, security of employment, pensions 
and sick relief, and political power the old pro- 
gram, in short, of a movement revolutionary in 
language but reformistic in principle and in fact. 

How has this policy worked out? Last August, 
the "war cabinet" of Italian revolution nearly went 
to pieces over the question of participation in the 
government "Commissionissima," or grand coalition 
commission to draw up a program for reconstruc- 
tion. The moderates like Mr. Turati insisted on 
uniting with the Government in working out a labor 



program. The radicals insisted on rigid adherence 
to the program of non-participation in peace or re- 
construction, and they carried their point. But this 
was still during the war period of Marxian ortho- 
doxy. Late in December the first break in non- 
intervention occurred when the General Federation 
approved the Government program for the fight on 
illiteracy. In January Mr. Orlando gave out his 
proclamation for the national elections, and the 
General Federation, independently of the Socialist 
Party, responded with its own political program, so 
that for a time the conservative press was heralding 
a split between Party and Federation. This how- 
ever was a mistaken interpretation of that event. 
The Federation's action was simply its own enunci- 
ation of issues later incorporated in the platform of 
the Party itself, which voted not to boycott the 
elections, then regarded as impending, but to par- 
ticipate therein in force. Next came the acceptance 
by the Federation of a proposal, originating with 
Mr. Meda, the clerical minister of reconstruction, 
for direct representation, in the bureaucracy, of cap- 
ital and labor independent of political machinery. 
And finally, when the Government had been deaf to 
the demands of the northern, industrials that the 
bureaucracy remove war restrictions on business 
and restore individual initiative, and when, in im- 
patience, the industrialists convening at Milan had 
voted to dispense with bureaucratic assistance and 
to resist interference from the Government, the 
Federation signed with the manufacturers a pact 
for the realization of the eight-hour day, with ad- 
justable wage scales and guarantees of social 
improvements. 

This, viewed objectively and stripped of revolu- 
tionary enthusiasms and anti-Bolshevik interpreta- 
tions, is the record of the "official" revolutionary 
organizations that form the nucleus of the pre- 
dicted Italian upheaval. It is an official record, 
and a record of officials; for the measure in which 
the proletariat itself has participated in agitation is 
to be found in the various movements that have 
featured the Italian social war during the last four 
months. 

It is in the populace that the revolutionary spirit 
exists, but in doses unknown to everybody. To 
test out this spirit, we witnessed during April and 
May a number of propagandistic strikes and demon- 
strations the sole intent of which was to arouse 
enthusiasm, advertise leaders and organizations, 
bring the workers back into the Labor Chambers, 
and discover the temper of the masses and learn 
the psychological motives to which they are most 
likely to respond. The spectacular features of 
these movements, such as the destruction of the 
Avanti establishment at Milan, were, as usual,

furnished by the reactions of the young class-con- 
scious Nationalists, reinforced, for the moment, by 
the spoiled children of the victorious army the dec- 
orated Arditi always ready for excitement and 
eager for a fight. During June and July the 
effort was broadened, and the organizations began 
to bid for a centralized agitation. Here we come in 
contact with the internal structure of Italian labor 
organization. There is the superficial rift in the 
Socialist-Federation combination made by the exclu- 
sion from the official organizations of the pro-war 
revolutionists, who formed last year the Italian 
Socialist Union and the Italian Labor Union. 
There is then the fundamental division isolating 
on the left the Italian Syndicalist Union heirs of 
the anarchistic tradition and on the right the Ital- 
ian Federation of Workingmen, which is the Catho- 
lic union. Inside the really representative Gen- 
eral Federation we have the autonomous Labor 
Chambers, the various industrial and agrarian trade 
federations, and the provincial organizations. In 
the last months the rival organizations have been 
bidding for popular support by initiating strikes 
and demonstrations, or contesting for the leadership 
of disturbances in course. Nor has the General 
Federation been able to prevent its local units from 
starting enterprises of their own. The causes of 
discontent in Italy are expressed, for the individual 
worker as for the individual citizen, in very specific 
terms of comfort. It is a long distance between the 
theories of revolutionary action and eagerness of 
suffering people to give vent to their impatience. 
That is why the actual uprisings are always greater 
and smaller than the calculated policy which inspires 
them, greater in that they at once involve more 



people than the revolutionary organization em- 
braces, but smaller in that often a revolt starts to 
change the world order but subsides with a change 
in the price of* potatoes. 

When the Italian situation is stripped of exagger- 
ation, we come to an organization committed to revo- 
lution, yes, but to revolution by reform; striving to 
reassemble its scattered forces and failing in its 
first effort, since the war, to affirm its centralized 
leadership. If this conclusion is unromatic, it has 
the advantage of being objective. The cry will be 
for revolution, but the Italian proletariat will be 
content with less than justice the promise of at- 
tempts to get justice. As a matter of fact, it is 
going to get more justice than ever before. When 
something like normal conditions are restored in 
Italy, we shall find, in her internal organization, a 
recognition of organized labor quite parallel to that 
in England, and a trend toward industrial liberal- 
ism, on a capitalistic basis, proportionate to labor 
strength. This is the whole significance of the con- 
ferences now going on in the " eight-hour day " 
commission composed of representatives of the Gov- 
ernment, under Maggiorino Ferraris, representa- 
tives of capital, and delegates from the General 
Federation and the Socialist Party. When one 
studies the Italian revolutionary movement, not in 
what is said about it by its enemies, nor even in 
what it says about itself, but in what it actually 
does, one gets a vivid impression of its sense of re- 
sponsibility, not only for the happiness of the work- 
ing people of Italy, but for the preservation and de- 
velopment of what is called civilization. 



ARTHUR LIVINGSTON. 



The Melodic Line 



I 



T HAS BEEN SAID that all the arts are constantly 
attempting, within their respective spheres, to at- 
tain to something of the quality of music, to assume, 
whether in pigment or pencil or marble or prose, 
something of its speed and flash, emotional complete- 
ness and well-harmonied resonance; but of no 
other single art is that so characteristically or per- 
sistently true as it is of poetry. Poetry is indeed in 
this regard two-natured ; it strikes us, when it is at 
its best, quite as sharply through our sense of the 
musically beautiful as through whatever implica- 
tions it has to carry of thought or feeling; it plays 
on us alternately or simultaneously through sound 
as well as through content. The writers of free 
verse have demonstrated, to be sure, that a poetry 
sufficiently effective may be written in almost en- 
tire disregard of the values of pure rhythm. The 



poetry of H. D. is perhaps the clearest example of 
this. Severe concentration upon a damascene 
sharpness of sense-impression, a stripping of images 
to the white clear kernel, both of which matters 
can be more meticulously attended to if there are 
no bafflements of rhythm or rhyme-pattern to be 
contended with, have to a considerable extent a 
substitutional value. Such a poetry attains a vitre- 
ous lucidity which has its own odd heatless charm. 
But a part of its charm lies in its very act of de- 
parture from a norm which, like a background or 
undertone, is forever present for it in our minds ; 
we like it in a sense because of its unique per- 
versity as a variation on this more familiar order 
of rhythmic and harmonic suspensions and resolu- 
tions ; we like it in short for its novelty ; and it even- 
tually leaves us unsatisfied, because this more famil- 



THE DIAL 



August 9 



iar order is based on a musical hunger which is as 
profound and permanent as it is universal. 

When we read a poem we are aware of this 
musical characteristic, or analogy, in several ways. 
The poem as a whole in this regard will satisfy us 
or not in accordance with the presence, or partial 
presence, or absence, of what we might term musi- 
cal unity. The Ode to a Nightingale is an example 
of perfect musical unity; the Ode to Autumn is an 
example of partial musical unity partial because 
the resolution comes too soon, the rate of curve is 
too abruptly altered; many of the poems by con- 
temporary writers of free verse Fletcher or Ald- 
ington or H. D. illustrate what we mean by lack 
of musical unity or integration, except on the sec- 
ondary plane, the plane of what we might call oro- 
tundity; and the most complete lack of all may be 
found in the vast majority of Whitman's poems. 
This particular sort of musical quality in poetry is 
however so nearly identifiable with the architec- 
tural as to be hardly separable from it. It is 
usually in the briefer movements of a poem that 
musical charm is most keenly felt. And this sort 
of brief and intensely satisfactory musical move- 
ment we might well describe as something closely 
analogous to what is called in musical compositions 
the melodic line. 

By melodic line we shall not mean to limit our- 
selves to one line of verse merely. Our melodic 
line may be, indeed, one line of verse, or half a line, 
or a group of lines, or half a page. What we have 
in mind is that sort of brief movement when, for 
whatever psychological reason, there is suddenly 
a fusion of all the many qualities, which may by 
themselves constitute charm, into one indivisible 
magic. Is it possible for this psychological change 
to take place without entailing an immediate height- 
ening of rhythmic effect? Possible, perhaps, but 
extremely unlikely. In a free verse poem we shall 
expect to see at such moments a very much closer 
approximation to the rhythm of metrical verse: in a 
metrical poem we shall expect to see a subtilization 
of metrical effects, a richer or finer employment of 
vowel and consonantal changes to that end. Iso- 
late such a passage in a free verse poem or metrical 
poem and it will be seen how true this is. The 
change is immediately perceptible, like the change 
from a voice talking to a voice singing. The 
change is as profound in time as it is in tone, yet 
it is one which escapes any but the most superficial 
analysis. All we can say of it is that it at once 
alters the character of the verse we are reading 
from that sort which pleases and is forgotten, pleases 
without disturbing, to that sort which strikes into 
the subconscious, gleams, and is automatically re- 
membered. For example, in the midst of the rich 



semi-prose recitative of Fletcher's White Symphony 
a recitative which charms and entices, but does 
not quite enchant or take one's memory one 
comes to the following passage: 

Autumn ! Golden fountains, 
And the winds neighing 
Amid the monotonous hills ; 
Desolation of the old gods, 
Rain that lifts and rain that moves away; 
In the green-black torrent 
Scarlet leaves. 

It is an interlude of song, and one remembers it. 
Is this due to an intensification of rhythm? Partly, 
no doubt, but not altogether. The emotional 
heightening is just as clear, and the unity of im- 
pression is pronounced ; it is a fusion of all these 
qualities, and it is impossible to say which is the 
primum mobile. As objective psychologists, all we 
can conclude is that in what is conspicuously a magi- 
cal passage in this poem there is a conspicuous in- 
crease in the persuasiveness of rhythm. 

This is equally true of metrical poetry. It is 
these passages of iridescent fusion that we recall 
from- among the many thousands of lines we have 
read. One has but to summon up from one's 
memory the odds and ends of poems which willy 
nilly one remembers, precious fragments cherished 
by the jackdaw of the subconscious: 

A savage spot as holy and enchanted 

As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted 

By woman wailing for her demon-lover. 

Beauty is momentary in the mind, 
The fitful tracing of a portal: 
But in the flesh it is immortal. 

And shook a most divine dance from their feet, 
That twinkled starlike, moved as swift, and fine, 
And beat the air so thin, they made it shine. 

Part of 'a moon was falling down the west 
Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. 
Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw 
And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand 
Among the harp-like morning glory strings, 
Taut with the dew from garden-bed to carves, 
As if she played unheard the tenderness 
That wrought on him. . . . 

Awakening up, he took her hollow lute, 
Tumultuous, and in chords that tenderest be, 
He played an ancient ditty long since mute, 
In Provence called, " La Belle Dame Sans Merci." 

And suddenly there's no meaning in our kiss, 
And your lit upward face grows, where we lie, 
Lonelier and dreadfuller than sunlight is, 
And dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky. 

All of these excerpts, mangled as they are by being 
hewed from their contexts, have in a noticeable de- 
gree the quality of the " melodic line." They are 
the moments for which, indeed, we read poetry; 
just as when, in listening to a modern music how- 
ever complex and dissonantal, it is after all the oc- 
casionally arising brief cry of lyricism which thrills 



1919 



THE DIAL 



99 



and dissolves us. When the subsconcious speaks, 
the subconscious answers. 

It is because in a good deal of contemporary 
poetry the importance of the melodic line is forgot- 
ten that this brief survey has been made. In our 
preoccupations with the many technical quarrels, and 
quarrels as to esthetic purpose, which have latterly 
embroiled our poets, we have, I think, a little lost 
sight of the fact that poetry to be poetry must after 
all rise above a mere efficiency of charmingness, or 
efficiency of accuracy, to this sort of piercing per- 
fection of beauty or truth, phrased in a piercing 
perfection of music. It is a wholesome thing for us 
to study the uses of dissonance and irregularity; we 
add in that way, whether sensuously or psychologic- 
ally, many new tones; but there is danger that the 
habit will grow upon us, that we shall forget the 
reasons for our adoption of these qualities and use 
them passim and without intelligence, or, as critics, 
confer a too arbitrary value upon them. 

The poetry of Mr. D. H. Lawrence is a case very 
much in point. His temperament is modern to a 
degree, morbidly self-conscious, sex -crucified, -an 
affair of stretched and twanging nerves. He be- 
longs of course to the psychological wing of modern 
poetry. Although we first met him as an Imagist, 
it is rather with T. S. Eliot, or Masters, or the 
much gentler Robinson, all of whom are in a sense 
lineal descendants of" the Meredith of Modern 
Love, that he belongs. But he does not much re- 
semble any of these. His range is extremely nar- 
row- it is nearly always erotic, febrile, and sultry at 
the lower end, plangently philosophic at the upper. 
Within this range he is astonishingly various. No 
mood is too slight to be seized tipon, to be thrust 
under his myopic lens. Here, in fact, we touch 
his cardinal weakness; for if as a novelist he often 
writes like a poet, as a poet he far too often writes 
like a novelist. One observes that he knows this 
himself; he asks the reader of Look! We Have 
Come Through! (Huebsch) to consider it not as a 
collection of short poems, but as a sort of novel in 
verse. No great rearrangement, perhaps, would 
have been necessary to do the same thing for New 
Poems or Amores, though perhaps not so cogently. 
More than most poets he makes of his poetry a 
sequential, though somewhat disjointed, auto- 
biography. And more than almost any poet who 
compares with him for richness of temperament, he 
is unselective in doing so, both as to material and 
as to method. 

He is, indeed, as striking an example as one could 
find of the poet who, while appearing to be capable 
of what we have called the melodic line, none the 
less seems to be unaware of the value or impor- 
tance of it, and gives it to us at random, brokenly, 



half blindly, or intermingled with splintered frag- 
ments of obscure sensation and extraneous detail 
dragged in to fill out a line. A provoking poet! 
ajid a fatiguing one : a poet of the demonic type, a 
man possessed, who is .swept helplessly struggling 
and lashing down the black torrent of his thought, 
alternately frenzied and resigned. " A poet," says 
Santayana, " who merely swam out into the sea of 
sensibility, arid tried to picture all possible things 
. . . would bring materials only to the work- 
shop of art; he would not be an artist." What 
Santayana had in mind was a poet who undertook 
this with a deliberateness but the effect in the case 
of Mr. Lawrence is much the same. He is seldom 
wholly an artist, even when he has his medium most 
under control. It is when he is at his coolest, often 
when he tries rhyme-pattern or rhythm-pattern or 
color-pattern in an attempt at the sort of icy kalei- 
doscopics at which Miss Lowell is adept that he is 
most tortuously and harshly and artificially and alto- 
gether unreadably at his worst. Is he obsessed with 
dissonance and oddity? It would seem so. His 
rhymes are cruel, sometimes, to the verge of murder. 
Yet, if he is not wholly an artist, he is certainly, 
in at least a fragmentary sense, a brilliant poet. 
Even that is hardly fair enough; the two more 
recent volumes contain more than a handful of 
uniquely captivating poems. They have a curious 
quality tawny, stark, bitter, harshly colored, salt 
to the taste. The sadistic element in them is strong. 
It is usually in the love poems that he is best: in 
these he is closest to giving us the melodic line that 
comes out clear and singing. Closest indeed; but 
the perfect achievement is seldom. The fusion is 
not complete. The rhythms do not altogether free 
themselves one feels that they are weighted; the* 
impressions are impetuously crowded and huddled ; 
and as concerns the commanding of words Mr. 
Lawrence is a captain of more force than tact ; he is 
obeyed, but sullenly. Part of this is due, no doubt, 
to his venturings among moods and sensations which 
no poet has hitherto attempted, moods secret and 
obscure, shadowy and suspicious. This is to his 
credit, and greatly to the credit of poetry. He is 
among the most original poets of our time, original, 
that is, as regards sensibility; he has given us somber 
and macabre tones, and tones of a cold and sinister 
clarity, or of a steely passion, which we have not 
had before. His nerves are raw, his reactions are 
idiosyncratic ; what is clear enough to him has some- 
times an unhealthily mottled look to us, esuriently 
etched none the less. But a great deal of the time 
he overreaches; he makes frequently the mistake of, 
precisely, trying too hard. What cannot be cap- 
tured, in this regard, it is no use killing. Brutality 
is no substitute for magic. One must take one's 



100 



August 9 



mood alive and singing, or not at all. 

It is this factor which in the poetry of Mr. Law- 
rence most persistently operates to prevent the 
attainment of the perfect melodic line. Again and 
again he gives us, indeed, a sort of jagged and 
spangled flame; but the mood does not sing quite 
with the naturalness or ease one would hope for; it 
has the air of being dazed by violence, or even 
seems, in the very act of singing, to bleed a little. 
It is a trifle too easy to say of a poet of whom this 
is true that the fault may be due to an obtrusion of 
the intellect among the emotions. Such terms do 
not define, are scarcely separable. Perhaps it would 
more closely indicate the difficulty to say that Mr. 
Lawrence is not only, as all poets are, a curious 
blending of the psychoanalyst and the patient, but 
that he endeavors to carry on both roles at once, to 
speak with both voices simultaneously. The solilo- 
quy of the patient the lyricism of the subcon- 
scious is forever being broken in upon by the too 
eager inquisitions of the analyst. If Mr. Lawrence 
could make up his mind to yield the floor 



unreservedly to either, he would be on the one hand 
a clearer and more magical poet, on the other hand 
a more dependable realist. 

One wonders, in the upshot, whether the theme 
of Look ! We Have Come Through ! had better not 
have been treated in prose. The story, such as it is, 
emerges, it is true, and with many deliciously clear 
moments, some of them lyric and piercing; but with 
a good deal that remains in question. It is the poet 
writing very much as a novelist, and all too often 
forgetting that the passage from the novel to the 
poem is among other things a passage from the 
cumulative to the selective. Sensations and impres- 
sions may be hewed and hauled in prose; but in 
poetry it is rather the sort of mood which, like a 
bird, flies out of the tree as soon as the axe rings 
against it, that one must look for. Mr. Lawrence 
has, of this sort, his birds, but he appears to pay 
little heed to them; he goes on chopping. And one 
has, even so, such a delight in him that not for 
worlds would one intervene

TH 



A Handy Guide for Business Men 



.HAT CHILD OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, 

of a plethoric continent, of a protective tariff, of 
competition and natural rights, the American busi- 
ness man, seemed lately to have passed his best days. 
His authority was disputed, his ethics questioned, 
his sacred efficiency doubted. He ceased in multi- 
tudes of minds to be considered the corner-stone 
of the nation, and sank to be the weary prop of 
vaudeville and musical comedy. The war did some- 
thing to restore his prestige, allowing him to appear 
in the role of self-sacrificing patriot and organizer 
of victory. Simultaneouscly it became evident that 
the tides of the new day had not lapped unnoticed 
at his feet. Welfare work of the old-fashioned sort 
began to develop under his groping hands into 
schemes of industrial self-government, some of them 
manifestly adopted to head off the unions, but 
others conceived in a real spirit of well doing. The 
more farsighted of the business men (using that 
term as loosely as Mr. Glenn Frank uses it) now 
realize that to save the privileges of their order 
they must make concessions to the rampant spirit 
of democracy. 

This is the text of the papers from the Century 
Magazine which Mr. Frank has collected under the 
title of The Politics of Industry (Century). Mr. 
Frank is not one of those venturesome thinkers who 
openly question the functions and prerogatives of 
the business man. He advocates a change of 
methods, not of status. No sense of a contradiction 



of democracy appalls him. For example : 

I think I could name twenty leaders of American busi- 
ness and industry who at this moment hold it within 
their power to determine the course of industrial relations 
in this country for the next twenty years at least. If 
these twenty men should pool their brain-power in a 
study of the labor problem with the same sustained 
thought they have given to financial problems, if they 
should counsel with students of labor as they have 
counselled with students of chemical, electrical and 
other problems that touch their business interests, and if 
they should take the initiative in making a sincere and 
exhaustive study of the whole area lying between the 
extreme forms of private capitalism and the extreme 
forms of State Socialism in order to find out whether or 
not there is a middle ground of industrial self-govern- 
ment on which both labor and capital can stand in a 
cooperation that will minister to the legitimate aims of 
both, I have no hesitancy in saying that they 
could with dramatic suddenness invent a new order of 
industry. 

Here is reform from the top such as would suit 
any benevolent potentate. The passage illustrates 
as well as any other the limitations of this really sin- 
cere attempt to get at the heart of the labor prob- 
lem. Mr. Frank writes like one addressing him- 
self, as perhaps he was, to the best side of a conven- 
tion of chambers of commerce. If he has doubts 
of the propriety of leaving the settlement of a grave 
social question to a limited class of interested men 
who now appear to have power in that field he fails 
to dwell upon them. Perhaps this is a defect only 
if his book is considered for general reading, and is 
an essential quality if it is intended, as it might 
easily be, to serve as a manual by whose aid the 



1919 



THE DIAL 



101 



faltering captain of industry may guide his steps 
through the dark days that now overhang the 
world. Mr. Frank appeals to the business man's 
pride, as when he urges that business be considered 
a profession of service on an equality with medicine 
and the ministry; to his fears, as when he points 
out that " the man who fails to adjust himself to 
the spirit and standards of this time will be ruth- 
lessly scrapped " ; to his acquisitiveness, as when he 
declares that " business cannot be permanently suc- 
cessful and permanently profitable unless its rela- 
tions with labor are cordial " ; and in several pas- 
sages to his sense of justice. Like a good attorney 
or a wise premier he presents even the less pleasant 
truths. He does not attempt to leave the illusion 
that either control or profits will be to the business 
man under the new order what they have been 
under the old. He holds up the naked menace of 
revolution : 

The question that concerns men who want consistent 
ind orderly progress instead of revolution is whether the 
King Johns of business and industry will collaborate with 
labor or take an attitude that will drive labor to wrest 
from them by revolutionary methods the Magna 1 Charta 
in industry. 

And he gives warning to all whom it may concern 
that " calling in the police, mobilizing the militia, 
employing detectives, arresting labor leaders, block- 
ing discussion, and forcing passions underground 
are not only undemocratic methods ; they are unin- 
telligent methods; they are played out." 

By the new order Mr. Frank seems to mean 
three things: the admission of the workers to a 
share in the control of industry, the control of in- 
dustry by industry rather than by government, and 



possibly a less accidental connection between the 
output of industry and the needs of the community. 
It is on the last point that he is most vague. He 
would introduce a measure of democracy impar- 
tially into department stores, coal mines, glue fac- 
tories, and all enterprises in which the relation of 
employer and employed exists, but he suggests no 
apparatus by which these working units, however 
perfect in themselves, may be knit into the larger 
social organism. His principles might produce a 
society in which many groups of workers would, be 
exceptionally favored, but in which the general 
level of well-being would still be held down by 
wastes of competition and exigencies of the market. 
A more exact definition of the business man, whom 
Mr. Frank seems to consider indiscriminately both 
as maker of goods and as competitive seller, would 
have to be made before it would be possible 
to tell just where he stands on the fundamental in- 
dustrial question of the time. Some business men, 
it may perhaps be demonstrated, serve no useful 
purpose. To democratize their uselessness will not 
of itself make them useful. 

Nevertheless, this book has a valuable service to 
perform. It will be read by men who could not be 
expected to listen to the radical's injunction to go 
hence and abolish themselves, and who will think 
Mr. Frank an exciting, dangerous man. And it 
will do them good. By the time they have learned 
the present lesson Mr. Frank, or some of his suc- 
cessors, will have moved along far enough to teach 
them another. Such are the ways of progress.

China Under Duress 



WH 



HEN THE CHINESE DELEGATES at Paris argued 
that the Chino-Japanese Agreements of 1915 
should be abrogated by the Council of the League 
of Nations since they had been effected " under 
duress," the Japanese made the pertinent reply 
that all the treaties which China had made of late 
years were signed by China " under duress." As 
a matter of fact, all the diplomatic relations con- 
ducted by outside nations with China have been 
characterized by the use of force, not on the prin- 
ciple of righteousness, conciliation, and fair-play. 
Politically, China once and again has been fleeced. 
The rule of right rather than that of might may 
possibly eject militarism from the nations of 
Europe, both great and small, but the decisions 
reached as to the Far East by the Big Three seem 
destined to postpone to some future century the 
beneficence of a world-reconstruction. The record 



is a bad one; any prophecy will be a gloomy one. 
In memory of Willard D. Straight, T. W. Over- 
lach has given a comprehensive, unbiased, historical 
account of the commercial, industrial, and political 
advance into China, and sometimes encroachment, 
by the great outside Powers, Great Britain, Rus- 
sia, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States. 
(Foreign Financial Control in China; Macmillan.) 
The book contains valuable citations and describes 
the growth of the idea of spheres of interest, which 
is commercial, and the idea of spheres of influence, 
which is political. The ambition of one country is 
not much higher than that of another. Perhaps 
the United States appears a little better than the 
rest, for the reason that with her there is no polit- 
ical ambition. Mention is made of the building of 
the Tientsin-Pukow Railway by joint participation 
of German and British companies and on terms

more generous to China than in previous railway 
concessions, but it is not stated that the original | 
concession with its element of cooperation by the 
Chinese was exclusively German, and that the 
British were afterwards admitted , only through 
German good-will and on acceptance of the same 
generous terms. So far as rivalry existed among 
the great Powers prior to the war, there were in 
the main two groups: the one comprised Russia, 
France, and Belgium, and the other Great Britain 
and Germany, while the United States and Japan 
for one reason or another were associated more with 
the latter group than with the former. The Four 
Power Loan Syndicate of Great Britain, France, 
Germany, and the United States became the Six 
Power Syndicate by admission of Russia and Japan, 
and was an effort at international cooperation on a 
big scale. This effort was weakened by withdrawal 
of American bankers, and later by forced exclusion 
of German interests. The status quo ante, not- 
withstanding friction and jealousies, was far better 
for China than the present confusion and passion 
of hate, with elimination and wellnigh extinction of 
all German interests. 

Here comes in the political feature, which is gen- 
erally overlooked as to its ultimate bearings on the 
future welfare of China and the preservation of her 
national integrity. From a military point of view 
there was no necessity whatever for bringing the 
European War into China. The capture or fail- 
ure to capture Tsingtao could have no effect on the 
ultimate issue of the war. The reason for the mili- 
tary move was those " commercial rivalries and 
jealousies," which President Wilson has declared to 
be " the prolific source of all wars." This is dis- 
closed by the Allied and Associate determination to 
force China, even months after the armistice, to 
liquidate all German property in China and close 
all German business houses. Linked with the com- 
mercial design by no means very laudable is the 
political one, resulting in the transfer to Japan of 
the German sphere of interest, which, along with 
the acquisition of Russian interests and the reten- 
tion of Japan's recognized sphere in Fukien, gives 
Japan a place of unequaled predominance. By the 
original arrangement before the war, with each 
country equal to every other in matters of influence, 
China had a chance to be held together, but by the 
new arrangement China finds herself helpless, first 
at the hands of predominant Japan and then at the 
hands of a group of nations victorious in war. 
This commingling of military, commercial, and po- 
litical designs, working disaster to China, has not 
yet been fully realized by the American public. It 
is apparent to even the most superficial observer 
that the war has been only a curse and a menace to 



China, though a gain to various other powers. 

W. Reginald Wheeler, who has lived only three 
years in China, in connection with the Hangchow 
College, has written a useful and interesting book 
on China and the World War (Macmillan). 
Like most writers he leaves the impression that 
Japan alone was concerned in bringing the war onto 
Chinese soil, and was alone responsible for all the 
disaster wrought on China. The omission of 
Great Britain, or at least the British Government, 
from the responsibility taken, is neither true to the 
facts nor fair to Japan. It is not believable that 
Japan would have sent an ultimatum to Germany 
for surrender of Tsingtao, if Japan's ally in Europe 
and one of the chief antagonists had not so wished 
it or asked for it. That Japan made use of her 
opportunities to further her own interests as well 
as to help England is only to be expected. There 
is no reason for leaving the spoils of war only to the 
European Allies. The only sound objection is to 
the unconcern of all the Powers for the rights and 
welfare, the wishes and efforts, of China and her 
new venture at establishing a Republic. 

Mr. Wheeler, while accurate as to all the wrongs 
and designs of Japan, likewise makes light of the 
responsibility of the American Government and 
especially of the American Minister in Peking, in 
inducing China to sever relations with Germany 
and in bringing the war issue into Chinese political 
discussion. It is only in a foot-note that he says: 
' The personal influence of the American Minister 
and his associates at Peking, throughout all the 
negotiations leading up finally to a declaration of 
war, was one of the strongest factors in inducing 
China to join the Allies." 

It was probably unknown to this author that at 
the very time the American Minister was urging on 
China American example and friendship, to coun- 
teract Japan's evil designs, the four Ambassadors 
in Tokio, for Great Britain, France, Russia and 
Italy, were negotiating secret agreements with 
Japan, assuring Japan of the possession of all the 
German rights and interests in Shantung, if Japan 
would allow China to go into the war. The 
author tells of all the promised advantages to accrue 
'to China by accepting the American advice and the 
Japanese demand, but he failed to take note of the 
other side of the shield, how China would be in 
danger of unexpected entanglements and sore dis- 
appointment. 

Mr. Wheeler criticises the Lansing-Ishii Agree- 
ment, recognizing a special position for Japan in 
Chinese affairs, but he condemns even more the 
Chinese -Japanese Military Agreement of 1918. 
Comparatively, then, Japan is to be blamed more 
than the instigators, for all the wrongs which have 



1919 



103 



been done to China since the beginning of the war 
in August 1914. 

It is well, in all discussion of Far Eastern ques- 
tions, to have more than an European or American 
statement; let the Japanese also be heard. A Japa- 
nese graduate of Columbia University, Shutaro 
Tomimas, discusses some of the more recent bear- 
ings of outside pressure on China. (The Open 
Door Policy and the Territorial Integrity of China ; 
A. G. Seiler, New York). He does not feel com- 
pelled to applaud all that the Japanese Govern- 
ment has done in China. His criticism of other 
nations is all the more effective. The second part 
of his book was a thesis awarded the Ernstein Prize 
in American Diplomacy by Columbia University in 
1918. The larger part of the book deals with the 
background of the Great War rather than with its 
development and fruition. He says correctly: " By 
the close of the last century 9,500,000 square miles, 
or more than half of the total area of Asia with a 
population of 400,000,000 or four-ninths of the 
total of the Asiatic races, had fallen into the pos- 
session of European Powers." But today he must 
add that Japan, like the European Powers, has en- 
croached on Chinese territory, and intruded on 



China's sovereign rights. Japan perhaps is only a 
learner a learner of Prussia but it seems a pity 
that " democratic " nations like America and Britain 
should have condoned the military, haughty, high- 
handed policy of Japan, or that Japan failed to act 
the true and generous neighbor in coming to the 
rescue of China. 

China at the moment is bewildered. Whom can 
she trust? The professions of what country are 
likely to be realized? Has the American Govern- 
ment shown good sense or generous impulses not 
only by going into the war against one group of 
warring nations, but also by urging China to aban- 
don her neutrality and become entangled in the 
harrowing, perilous incidents of a war which con- 
cerned rivalries on the other side of the globe? 
Would not the true friend be one who would see 
the danger of war, and strain every effort to keep 
China at peace, botH within and without, equally 
friendly to all, and devoted to the supreme task of 
making secure and lasting the ideas of democracy 
and the forms of a democratic government? Shall 
China ever be free ? Or shall she continue in slavish 
submission to take orders from others, whether 

Japan, or Europe, or America? 

J ' GILBERT REID. 



I 



The Prussians of the Eastern World 



HAVE BEEN ASKED to explain the causes of 
what appears to 'be a singularly flagrant case of 
human ingratitude. After her brilliant success in 
1905, Japan was in a position to impose heavy con- 
ditions upon Russia. She showed herself, however, 
as generous in victory as she had been brave in war. 
Port Arthur, to be sure, yields but little in point 
of importance to Vladivostok; and it was largely 
due to the statesmanship of President Roosevelt, 
backed up by American public opinion, that Japan 
stopped at one-half of the Island of Sachalin. But 
all in all it must be admitted that heathen Japan 
exhibited a spirit of conciliation that might well 
afford a lesson in Christianity to the nations of the 
Western World. 

During the period that elapsed between the sign- 
ing of the treaty in the United States, and the out- 
break of the World War, Japan made every effort 
to manifest feelings of friendship towards Russia, 
and viewed without the least sign of irritation, in- 
deed with a supreme complacency, the puerile sulk- 
ings and snappings of Russia's stupid autocrat. 
Japan did not erect enduring arches of triumph after 
the example of Christian France, or set up statues 
symbolizing victory over her neighbor. The slogan 
of her policy was, so far as we could make it out, 
"Let us forgive and forget and be friends." 

When the call came in 1914, Japan was prompt 
to join on the side of Russia. And when in 1918 



the tidal wave of Bolshevism swept from European 
Russia into Siberia, it was Japan who led the Allied 
Powers to the aid of a distressed and helpless neigh- 
bor. Yet, for all that in the face of so much mag- 
nanimity the Siberians have not ceased to hate the 
Japanese; they resent the presence of the Japanese 
in Siberia just as much as we ourselves would resent 
the presence in America of the soldiers and subjects , 
of a victorious Germany! 

The whole world knows the Russians to be a 
patient and hospitable people, quick to appreciate an 
act of kindness, and never slow to forgive an 
offence. Sullenness and vindictiveness are not parts 
of their nature. Whence then this stubborn hatred 
of a neighbor, this inveterate resentment of the co- 
operation of a friend? 

The explanation obtruded itself upon me in the 
course of my activities in Siberia. It is an unpleas- 
ant task to tell the things that I have come to know 
in this connection, for I have acquired a real liking 
for Japan and the Japanese. In Siberia the Japan- 
ese treated me with a cordiality and a politeness 
that left nothing to be desired except, of course, 
any degree of success in my efforts at mediation 
between them and their unfortunate hosts. In 
Japan itself I met with nothing but the utmost 
kindness and consideration. Like many another 
visitor I admired the beauty of the scenery and the 
artistic achievements of the people, from the making

of lacquervvare to the decoration of landscape. I 
admired the clean, frail little houses in which they 
live, the picturesque kimonos which they wear, the 
tiny charcoal stoves on which they cook their delicate 
food. It is true that the sight of little children 
mere babies they seemed to me preparing oakum, 
curling hair for mattresses, carrying heavily loaded 
baskets of earth and doing a variety of other hard 
work, was very distressing. And I must confess 
that my sense of distress amounted to downright 
nausea when I saw women harnessed to wagons by 
ropes and dragging burdens that would bring down 
a storm of opprobrium upon the head of an Ameri- 
can mule-driver. But amid the wonders of this toy- 
land an apology rises automatically to one's lips: 
the country is so small that it cannot produce food 
for both mules and people, and people, therefore, 
must serve as mules. I was shocked by the sight 
of naked old women shivering in the cold and rain 
on the road to Nikko. But I soon found myself 
gazing with wonder and delight at the carved wood- 
en temples, fantastically decorated with copper and 
bronze, like so many huge, enchanted steamer- 
trunks in which the fairies of a dream-ship might 
pack their gossamer trousseaux. And as I wandered 
through the sacred groves of Nikko I thought that 
old Jupiter must have been a barbarian to choose 
Olympus for his dwelling place. 

For the sake of the pretty country and the pretty 
things in it, and the odd, childlike ways of the 
people, I would willingly overlook many a fault. 
I have even forgiven the sleepless nights that I 
passed in the Japanese sleeping cars, with berths 
a foot too short for the average-sized Westerner. 
And when a man forgives that, he forgives every- 
thing else. 

But the Russian cannot forgive and forget. The 
factor of distance, which in our case lends charm to 
and ensures safety from Japan, is in his case in- 
considerable. Proximity to and fear of the needy 
little country have both conspired to enhance Rus- 
sian prejudices. Japan's effort to don the dress of 
German civilization has only tended to maintain the 
Russian superstition that the Japanese is an inferior 
racial type. There is a deeply grounded conviction 
among uneducated Siberians that the Japanese are 
not really human, and that they indeed have little 
tails. The great advantage of the Japanese their 
capacity to live on little is interpreted by the Rus- 
sian as a corroboration of his belief in the inferiority 
of the type. The art of Japan, so charming to us, 
impresses her nearest neighbor as but an arrogant 
attempt to ape the works of man. And it is the 
Russian's conviction that, being sub-human, the Jap- 
anese is not susceptible to persuasion by argument, 
and that slyness and low cunning serve him instead 
of the human faculty of reason. Such is a common 
Russian estimate of the Japanese. What then must 
have been the feelings of the Russians when they 
received their humiliating thrashing at Port Arthur ! 

If by the least chance Russia could have said to 
Japan at the outbreak of the World War, "Keep 



out of this, you execrable monkey! I refuse to have 
you for an ally!" if Russia could only have said it, 
we may be sure that she would have done so. But 
to decline an alliance with Japan meant to create 
an ally for Germany and Japan was a model of 
German militarism. And so Russia clenched her 
teeth and submitted to the embrace. 

"We went into the war with this horrible ser- 
pent on our backs," an army officer of the old mon- 
archist stamp, a staunch supporter of Kolchak, once 
said to me. "We knew perfectly well what a hard 
job we should have to shake it off. But we had no 
choice. And now the serpent's coils grow tighter 
about our bodies from day to day." 

" But," I objected, " the Japanese are certainly 
weeding out the Bolsheviki for you. You wouldn't 
know what to do without them." 

"True," he replied sadly. "The boa-constrictor 
is killing the parasites on our body but she is 
crushing our bones at the same time." 

JAPANESE THEFT OF SIBERIAN MILITARY 
SECRETS 

It was easy to account for intolerance of the 
Japanese on the part of a disgruntled army officer of 
the old regime. From a position of influence and 
power he had dropped to the ignominious state of 
an ordinary mortal, with the usual prosaic advan- 
tages of a meager salary and a precarious pay-day. 
And here was the undersized Japanese officer a 
thing upon which he would not have deigned to cast 
his eye in better times strutting about all over the 
place, ostensibly his protector, really his lord. But 
the elected Zemstvo officials those humble intellec- 
tuals, the clerks and school-teachers of yesterday, 
modest, reasonable, and unprejudiced men their in- 
tolerant attitude toward the Japanese was puzzling 
indeed. For it was the moral backing of the Japan- 
ese that had induced the Czechoslovaks to put the 
Bolshevik Soviets out of business in Siberia, thus 
enabling the regularly elected organs of democratic 
government to take their proper places. I pointed 
out, this important fact to one of their leading 
officials. 

"What unsophisticated people you Americans 
are," he said. 

" Do you think the motives of the Japanese are 
dishonest?" I asked. 

" The fisherman's motives in catching fish can- 
not really be said to be dishonest from the stand- 
point of the fisherman. He must eat in order to 
live. And if he can catch more fish in muddy 
water, he will, of course, keep the water muddy. 
Japan must have fish." 

I asked why he emphasized the " must." 

" Because ' must ' is the key to this particular 
situation. If you have traveled in Japan, you 
have doubtless noticed that the country fairly 
swarms with children. The fact is that she has 
reached that stage when the productivity of her 
land can no longer keep pace with her increasing 
population. The question of expansion, therefore,. 



1919

is with Japan not one of choice, but of necessity." 

"Is that a reason for disliking the Japanese?" 

" If we are to retain a hold on the Far East," 
replied the Russian, " we must keep an eternally 
vigilant eye upon Japan; and eternal vigilance is 
the equivalent of eternal enmity. There is another 
consideration. Remember that Japan is a monarchy, 
while we are a republic. We are weak and strug- 
gling, but we are a republic nevertheless. Japan 
knows that republicanism is contagious Russian 
republicanism virulently so. And she realizes that 
her security as a monarchy can to a great extent 
be assured by keeping the water in our republic as 
muddy as possible." 

My friend's reasoning struck me as rather cir- 
cuitous and abstract. It was not long howevei 
before I bumped against more proximate and con- 
crete explanations of the hatred of the Siberians for 
the Japanese. 

I sat at lunch with the delegate who represented 
Habarovsk in the Provincial Zemstvo Council. M. 
Medviedyeff, Chairman of the Maritime Province 
Zemstvo, was also a member of the party. The 
conversation turned on Japan. M. Medviedyeff 
declared that the Japanese had been amply re- 
warded for their friendship to Siberia; that as 
friends, they had been able to obtain certain things 
in Siberia which, as enemies, they could not have 
obtained except at the cost of billions of rubles 
and tens of thousands of lives. 

My curiosity was thoroughly aroused, and I 
promptly asked M. Medviedyeff what he meant. 

" There are some things that one country ought 
never to take from another. Japan has taken 
these things from us," he said in his usual sad, 
modest way. 

I repeated my question. He exchanged glances 
with the gentleman from Habarovsk. 

" Are you by any chance familiar with the topo- 
graphical features of the Maritime Province?" he 
asked me. 

I replied that I had seen of them as much as 
one may see in approaching Vladivostok by steamer, 
and in the course of a few drives through the 
Sills. The Vladivostok harbor gateway was 
juarded by high rocky islands which seemed capa- 
ble of concealing defenses more formidable than 
those of Gibraltar itself. For the rest f supposed 
that the Maritime Province consisted of a chain 
of low mountains facing the Sea of Japan. 

' True," he said. " Thousands upon thousands 
of hills stand between the sea and the plains. Have 
you noticed anything peculiar about those hills?" 

" No." 

" I hardly supposed you would. The fact is that 
a number of them are really fortresses. This, the 
eastern entrance to Siberia, has been protected 
against the invasion of an enemy. You will readily 
see that it would be a difficult matter to pass 
through a wide belt of mountains a number of 
which contain concealed fortifications." 

I saw the point. 



" The construction of these fortifications," he 
continued, " has taken over 60 years, and has cost 
scores of millions of rubles. Now, my friend, can 
you guess against whom this protection was de- 
signed? Against America? Against France? 
Against Spain perhaps?" 

I ventured to guess that it might have be^n de- 
signed especially with a view to the possibility of 
Japanese aggression. 

" Japan ! Ah, you guessed right." 

The speaker sighed, and his sad face became sad- 
der still. He dropped his head till his beard rested 
against his breast. 

" The Japanese haven't destroyed your fortifica- 
tions, so far as I know? " 

"They have!" he responded abruptly. "To 
discover such fortifications is to destroy them. Once 
the enemy knows which of the thousand hills is 
fortified, the defenses become practically useless. 
The topographical maps and descriptions of these 
fortifications were kept in the archives of Haba- 
rovsk. There the Japanese went, as you have been 
told, to hunt down some straggling remnants of 
Bolsheviki. What they really wanted and what 
they actually "got, was the collection of topographi- 
cal maps and descriptions of the fortifications of the 
Maritime Province Siberia's supreme protection 
against invasion by Japan." 

I searched my mind for an apology. Japan 
was our ally. 

" You see," continued M. Medviedyeff, seeing 
that I was silent, " the Japanese, of their own 
merit, could not have come here as friends. As 
such we would never have admitted them, for we 
know that Japan's love for Siberia is the love of 
the lion for the lamb. We admitted the Japanese 
under, .as we thought, the best guarantee in the 
world." 

'What was that?" 

" The guarantee of the United States of Amer- 
ica. We knew that America was our friend, and 
we were convinced that in permitting the Japanese ' 
to enter our country, America would protect us 
at least to this extent that she would not allow 
Japan, of all nations, to rob Siberia of her de- 
fenses." , 

I asked whether our General Graves had been 
informed of the seizing of the topographical maps 
at Habarovsk. It appeared that the head of the 
government of the Province was not acquainted 
with the American general. I offered to arrange 
an introduction, so that he might make his com- 
munication in person. 

The next day Gen. Graves received us, together 
with M. Agareff, the mayor of Vladivostok, whom 
I had thought it advisable to take along. The 
chief of the A. E. F. was both surprised and 
shocked by the statements of the representa- 
tives of the city and the province, and he ex- 
pressed himself with his usual frankness. He 
told them, however, that with the authority at his 
disposal he was powerless to curb the Japanese,,

particularly as their general was his senior. But 
he promised to report the matter immediately to 
Washington. 

" ECONOMIC PENETRATION " OF SIBERIA ON THE 
GERMAN PLAN 

One of the guiding principles of the American 
War Trade Board in Vladivostok, to which I 
was loaned for a time by the American Committee 
on Public Information, was to stabilize as far as 
possible the Russian ruble, or at least to abstain 
from any action that might tend to depreciate it. 
Such an attitude was necessary if the establishment 
of a Russian branch of the Board was to render 
honest assistance in the rehabilitation of the coun- 
try. Whenever Russian merchants proposed to 
order goods from America, the local office took 
all the trouble in the world to ascertain whether 
such goods could not be obtained on the spot, so 
as to save the Siberians the high cost of shipping. 
Importation from America would involve the crea- 
tion of new credits for Siberia, with a consequent 
further depreciation of the already depreciated cur- 
rency. 

It was naturally disappointing to discover that 
our Japanese allies had very small consideration 
for the financial problems with which Siberia was 
struggling. Japanese war bonds, for instance, were 
floated in Siberia, thus abstracting the little actual 
wealth that was left in that poor country. Nor 
was the practice of paying for, merchandise with 
these bonds discontinued after the lively protest of 
the Vladivostok Exchange, in October. True, the 
Bank of Korea thenceforth confined such payments 
to Japanese merchants resident in Siberia, provid- 
ing a stock of rubles for payment to Russian firms. 
The change in transaction, however, really 
amounted to this: instead of borrowing Siberian 
products from the Russians, Japan borrowed these 
products through Japanese merchants in Siberia. 

Following the Brest-Litovsk treaty, indignation 
ran high in the United States when it was reported 
that Germans were taking advantage of unstable 
political conditions to exploit Russia. They were 
said to be buying farms, houses, mines, factories; 
the American sense of fairness revolted at such an 
appropriation of the last drops of sustenance of a 
country in agony. But I am pained to admit that 
the methods employed in Siberia by our Japanese 
allies were strikingly similar to those employed by 
the conquering Germans in European Russia. 
Throughout the country the Japanese bought fev- 
erishly both real estate and industrial enterprises. 
A recital of the numerous individual instances would 
make, I fear, indifferent reading. I shall mention 
but a few typical cases. 

In September the only large electrical plant at 
Chita was bought for 1,600,000 rubles (the ruble 
being equal now to about 10 cents) by lodo Usi- 
nosuko, a Japanese merchant. 

In the same month, in the city of Chita and in 
neighboring towns, Japanese landbanks were 



opened, estates were bought by Japanese subjects 
as fast as bargains could be transacted, and large 
contracts were closed for the erection of buildings. 

The Irkutsk newspapers reported that in the 
month of October the Japanese were negotiating 
for the purchase of the Tchernoffsky mines. The 
Temporary Siberian Government, upon discovering 
this, issued an order by telegraph prohibiting the 
sale. The Japanese were obliged to be satisfied with 
contracts for supplies. 

The following item, is of interest. It is taken 
from Zemstvo Information, the official organ of 
the regularly elected government: 

" BENEVOLENCE " 

A group of Japanese capitalists have made an offer 
to the Btagovieschensk City Administration of a loan for 
the construction of a tramway and water system, propos- 
ing in this connection to undertake the construction and 
subsequent exploitation of the same on the basis of a 
franchise. 

One of the most disagreeable phases of the situ- 
ation was the fact that in a number of instances 
the Japanese attempted to make direct use of the 
presence of their military forces to promote their 
commercial advantages. Japanese army officers 
were stationed on the docks of the Port of Vladi- 
vostok. They soon insinuated themselves into 
virtual control of the customs, meddling with the 
management of the Russian officials and frequently 
countermanding their orders. This objectionable 
activity went to .such limits that in November the 
Director of the Customs, M. Kovalevsky, whom 
I knew quite well, was driven to complain to M. 
Zimmerman, the Commissar of the Province (Kol- 
chak's appointee), that the interference of the 
Japanese made it impossible for him to comply with 
the Customs Regulations. ' 

It was plain that the Japanese had little respect 
for the law of the country. 

" They seem to consider the presence of their 
troops an adequate substitute for our laws and 
institutions," said a leading official of the Zemstvo 
administration. 

I asked him for a concrete example. 

" Our law, for instance," he replied promptly, 
" prohibits the exportation of metals. There is 
good reason for this prohibition. We have done 
very little mining for the past five years. To carry 
metals out of Siberia now is to take away the last 
breath of our life." 

I knew it. For the lack of a couple of cast iron 
stove-doors I had been compelled to relinquish a 
building that might otherwise have saved two 
hundred wretched Russian lives. 

' The Japanese paid no attention to this prohi- 
bition, and in spite of our repeated protests con- 
tinued to carry metals out of Siberia. The other 
day an idea struck us. We despatched a company 
of militia, armed with revolvers, to the docks, with 
orders to stop the outrage. The demonstration 
proved a success we rescued a large quantity of 
metal. The fact is that the Japanese did not care to

risk their reputation with the Allies, and so de- 
sisted from the use of rifles." 

I asked the Zemstvo officials to bring this inci- 
dent to the attention of Gen. Graves, which they 
did forthwith. 

On January I the Zemstvo of the Mari- 
time Province published a discussion of the new 
economic problems facing Siberia. I noted among 
other items the following: 

" Japanese capital, being unable to compete with 
the high quality of American and English manufac- 
tured products, is resorting in Siberia to the old 
and well-tried method of creating for itself a sphere 
of economic influence. Japanese capital, of the 
typically usurious kind so far as Si'beria is con- 
cerned, has seized the entire market of the Far 
East. Moreover, the occupation of Vladivostok 
and of the other Russian ports on the Pacific, to- 
gether with the maintenance of a practical control 
over the railway transportation of the Far East, 
affords this capital the opportunity to monopolize 
almost the entire market of Siberia." 

An utterance of the Japanese Director of the 
South Manchurian Railway seems to me to sum 
up the whole question with admirable clearness 
and brevity. Speaking of the Russian problems 
before the Peace Conference, M. Kavakani de- 
clared: "Siberia cannot be left alone in her 
present condition. The lawful interests of Japan 
and America in that country must be ensured inde- 
pendently of the Peace Conference." 

The brief comment on this statement by the 
editor of the Irkutsk newspaper* Nashi Dni, is 
as interesting as the statement itself. " Such talk," 
says the editor, " on the part of a representative of 
an allied power sounds strange to us. Is it true then 
that the assistance to Siberia consists in ensuring 
the lawful interests of Japan? Who was it that 
wrote those ' laws ' ? And how comes it that they 
were unwritten five years ago? Woe to the 
vanquished!" thus he answers his own question 
"As it was in the time of the Roman Empire, so 
is it to-day! " 

r 
JAPANESE HUMANITARIANISM IN ACTION 

Towards the latter part oi November I saw some 
six hundred sick and dying Russians in a military 
hospital at Nikolsk-Ussuriysky. The hospital had 
accommodations for only two hundred. The patients 
were crowded in a manner quite inconceivable to 
an American. Some of the cots were moved close 
together,, so as to accommodate three patients in 
two cots. Most of the patients lay on the cold, 
black asphalt of the corridors, resting their heads 
on each other's bodies. There was no bedding 
whatever. There was no food except coarse black 
bread and very weak tea. There were no medi- 
caments. There were only three doctors, three nurses, 
and twenty orderlies. A great number of the 
patients were suffering from a disease which re- 
quires particularly ample sanitary accommodations, 



and particularly strenuous efforts on the part of 
doctors, nurses, and orderlies. Insufficient sanitary 
provisions, together with insufficient attendance, 
soon converted the hospital into an abomination. 
Typhus made its appearance, and was spreading 
rapidly. The only hope of stopping its spread was 
to separate the patients at least to the extent that 
their bodies would not touch. 

Next door to the congested hospital was another 
hospital of 500 beds, fully equipped. It also was 
a Russian military hospital, one of the most capa- 
cious in Siberia. The Japanese had asked that it 
be loaned to them, promising to run it for the benefit 
of the Russians, and the Russians, good-naturedly 
enough, had consented. The new incumbents 
indeed advertised that they were ready to receive 
and treat any Russians who might apply a wise 
procedure, I thought, which might serve to placate 
a rather unfriendly population. But none of the 
townspeople were willing to be treated by the 
Japanese, and so only eight out of the five hundred 
beds were occupied. 

The American Red Cross relieved the situation 
in the congested hospital with respect to food, 
medicaments, and clothing. On the twentieth of No- 
vember, in response to my urgent telegram, I 
received from Vladivostok several carloads of sup- 
plies. But with or without food and clothing, 
typhus and congestion would surely kill most of 
our patients. What we needed above all else was 
room. I sat in solemn consultation with the three 
hospital doctors. The plan which first presented 
itself was, naturally, to place a number of our 
patients in the large hospital next door. 

" But I have already seen the Japanese physi- 
cians," declared Dr. Seliesnieff, the superintendent. 
' They decline to admit our people." 

This announcement struck me as ridiculous and 
I decided to give them a specimen of the American 
way of doing things. In the company of another 
American, Mr. Bukely, and Dr. Seliesnieff I imme- 
diately went to the hospital occupied by the 
Japanese. But the Japanese sentry at the gate 
refused admittance, in spite of the American uni- 
form. We must first obtain passes from the Japan- 
ese Headquarters. We called up the Japanese 
Colonel by telephone and explained the urgency of 
our business. He gave us an appointment for the 
next day at three. 

While waiting that afternoon in the office of 
the Russian hospital, a strange thing happened. The 
head nurse rushed in pale as a ghost and trembling 
with fright. She had been approached by a couple 
of Japanese soldiers from the hospital across the 
way with a request to relinquish forthwith some 
medical paraphernalia of which she had charge. 
She refused. They struck the ground in front of 
her feet with the butts of their rifles and then at 
the points of their bayonets compelled her to yield. 
It is difficult to describe the state of consternation 
into which the Russians were thrown by this an- 
nouncement.

"A conquered nation!" murmured one of the 
doctors. " How long, O Lord, how long! " 

I attempted to comfort them by an assurance that 
the American Red Cross would make good their 
loss. 

"But they have also taken they have taken 
they " stammered the nurse. 

" Dear Madam," I said, " don't you see that 
you are creating a panic here by speaking like that? 
You are driving fear into the hearts of these Rus- 
sians. What else have the Japanese taken from 
you? Your typhus patients, perhaps?" I tried to 
be as cheerful as possible. 

" My orderlies! They have taken seyenteen of 
my orderlies! What can I do now with only three 
orderlies for so many sick people?" The poor 
woman burst out crying and dropped into a chair. 
I knew that the doctors and nurses had not slept 
for the past three nights, and that they had hardly 
stopped to eat. But I tried to comfort them by 
pointing to the satisfaction which they must derive 
from doing their duty to the uttermost. 

"If only we escape a repetition of yesterday's 
outrage! We live in everlasting dread." Yester- 
day's outrage consisted in the entrance of some 
Japanese soldiers into the woman's ward, where 
they attempted to make free with the patients. 
They had been driven off, however, by Dr. Selies- 
nieff's threat ( of a beating and by the chorus of 
frightened screams. 

The next day, at the appointed hour, we were 
entering the Japanese Headquarters at Nikolsk 
Mr. Strong, Mr. Bukely, and myself, together with 
Dr. Manget, who had just arrived from Vladi- 
vostok. Instead of the Colonel we were to be received 
by his adjutant. While waiting for him to take 
his warm bath, we were accorded every politeness. . 
We were given tea and cigarettes, and an interest- 
ing talk on flower arrangement. 

In due course of time the adjutant appeared. He 
was very sympathetic and seemed eager to relieve 
the situation as quickly as possible. He knew of 
three buildings near the hospital, each of which 
would accommodate from thirty to forty people. 
They were old, abandoned wooden barracks. All 
they needed was to have some window panes set 
in and the heating arrangements put in order. He 
could let us have any one of the three buildings, 
but he asked that we take the building furthest 
away from the hospital. 

We explained that many of the Russian patients 
would surely be dead before any of the buildings 
he proposed could be properly equipped for hospital 
use ; that what we wanted was very definitely the 
hospital held by the Japanese. 

Was the situation as desperate as all that? Well, 
well, if that was the case he would look into the 
matter immediately. 

We all of us mounted drozshkis and made for 
the hospital. We entered the spacious hospital 
yard. The adjutant ordered the superintendent to 
come down and the two talked in Japanese. Finally 



he, turned to us and said through his German inter- 
preter, with an air of surprise: 

" The doctor tells me that we already have 
patients in our hospital." 

" Yes, but how many? I understand only 
eight?" 

Again he talked for a long time with the doctor. 

" Yes, you are right, eight patients. But those 
Russians you speak of are suffering from contagious 
diseases. The entire hospital might be infected." 

I explained that the Japanese doctors could pick 
out, say two or three hundred Russian patients, 
such as might seem to them to be free from typhus 
and dysentery. The patients could then be led in 
batches to the bathhouse, where the Red Cross 
would have new clothing ready for them, and in 
that state they would be brought to the Japanese 
hospital. The adjutant was sorry, but he had not 
the authority to open the hospital for such purposes. 
Had the Colonel the needed authority? He didn't 
know, but as this hospital was reserved for military 
uses, he hardly thought the Colonel could permit it 
to be used otherwise. We pointed to the fact that 
the hospital was already advertising its readiness to 
receive poor Russian civilians. Really? He was 
quite ignorant of medical matters. 

To make a long story short, four or five days 
later we saw the Colonel himself. We were again 
given tea and cigarettes. Again the Japanese offi- 
cers cast about in vain for ways and means to re- 
lieve our difficulties. But the fact was that no one 
present had any authority in the matter, and such 
being the case, we parted excellent friends. 

Three or four days later, we obtained the consent 
of the highest Japanese officials at Vladivostok, and 
in the company of a Japanese captain, who spoke 
English excellently well, and who was expressly sent 
by the high officials to facilitate our business, we 
came in force to Nikolsk again five Americans and 
the Japanese captain. We were received at the hos- 
pital by the superintending physician and his first 
adjutant. We were given tea and cigarettes. We 
were asked how many beds we wanted, and after a 
great deal of good-humored bargaining we compro- 
mised on ninety. Then the question of medical at- 
tendance arose. We would furnish the attendance, 
medical and other. Now was raised the question 
of food. We would furnish the food. Medica- 
ments? The American Red Cross would supply 
them. Slippers, pajamas, handkerchiefs the Red 
Cross . . . 

" But," interrupted Dr. Seliesnieff, addressing me 
in Russian, " I turned over to the Japanese complete 
outfits for five hundred patients. If I am permitted 
to go through the stock room, I can prove . . ." 

" Drop that, Doctor, for the time being let us 
get hold of those ninety beds." 

We left Nikolsk greatly elated by our success. A 
week later I received a letter from Dr. Seliesnieff, 
saying that the number of additional conditions at- 
tached by the Japanese to the transference of 



1919

patients was so great that he had been obliged to 
drop the matter altogether. He also informed me 
that he now had over seventy cases of typhus to cope 
with, and that the disease had attacked several of the 
attendants who lived outside the hospital and 
threatened to spread among the population at large. 

SIBERIA AND BELGIUM A DISCONCERTING 
PARALLEL 

As instances of arbitrary and violent action on the 
part of the Japanese soldiery in Siberia forced them- 
selves upon my attention in increasing numbers, I 
was irresistibly struck by a parallel between the con- 
duct of the Japanese and that of the Germans. I 
asked myself the question : Is there really any essen- 
tial difference between the wrongs committed by 
our enemies, the Germans, in Belgium and those 
committed by our allies, the Japanese, in Siberia? 
Cast about as I might for apologies, I was always 
obliged to answer in the negative. 

Out of a host of incidents a few examples may 
serve by way of illustration: 

In Arcadie-Semionovka the Japanese military 
authorities demanded that the Township Council 
supply them within four days with information re- 
garding the amount of cultivated land, the extent of 
the population, the numbers of domestic animals, of 
buildings and of wells, and the means of transporta- 
tion. In its report concerning this demand of the 
Japanese, the Township asks the County Adminis- 
tration whether in the future similar demands should 
be complied with. 

In the beginning of November, the City Council 
of Habarovsk received the following communication 
from Captain Nakamura, Commander of the Japa- 
nese Naval Company : " The workshops of the 
River Flotilla, as the property of the Russian Gov- 
ernment, pass under my control. The closing of 
the workshops by the City Administration will be 
considered illegal." 

The Sidiminsk Village Administration reports the 
following to the County Administration of Nikolsk- 
Ussuriysky! "On October 23 a company 
of Japanese soldiers quartered themselves in the 
Posiet Agronomic House, but rinding it unsuited to 
their needs, vacated and settled in the schoolhouse. 
Upon leaving the Agronomic House they carried 
with them a great number of its belongings, includ- 
ing a quantity of lumber, parts of the stove, the 
locks of the doors, and even some windows. They 
destroyed the barns for lumber. . . . The dep- 
redation still continues. The Administration has 
appealed to the Japanese Command to put a stop to 
these actions, but the appeal has so far brought no 
results." 

The following telegram, from Barabash, dated in 
November, and signed by the Commander of the 
local Japanese regiment, was received by the 
Executive Committee of the Maritime Province 
Zemstvo : " Have schoolhouse vacated for our quar- 



ters. If you wish you may move school into clock- 
tower. Reply immediately." 

No such advance announcement preceded the 
occupation of the village schoolhouse of Kruglicovo. 
The Japanese soldiers surrounded the building, tore 
down the doors, ordered the resident teacher and her 
family into the street and occupied the schoolhouse. 

" As a result of the incursion of Japanese troops," 
says the official report of the Zemstvo, " the Village 
of Uglovaya has suffered losses to the extent of 
15,000 rubles." 

The Tihonoff Township Administration reports 
to the Zemstvo County Administration in October 
as follows : " Armed detachments of the Japanese 
troops guarding the railway visit almost daily the 
farms and villages of the neighborhood and take 
away food products without paying for them. 
They search the houses for sugar and milk, and, 
upon finding these articles, seize them without 
offering to pay a single kopek. They treat the 
women roughly, insulting them with words and ac- 
tions. If the men intercede on behalf of the women, 
the Japanese" soldiers threaten them with bayonets." 

BOLSHEVIK BAITING AS A CLOAK FOR COMMON- 
MURDER 

Complaints were incessantly arriving from all 
quarters from private civilians, from Zemstvo offi- 
cials, and even from Kolchak and his appointees 
of the revolting and cruel activities of one of the 
most ferocious gangs of ruffians in history Cos- 
sack band of Kalmikoff. Under the pretense of 
hunting for Bolsheviki, they kept northeastern Sk 
beria in a state of unceasing terror. Citizens were 
kidnapped; prisons were opened and prisoners exe- 
cuted ; men were dragged from their workshops and 
their homes and murdered without the least pretense 
of a trial. 

The protests of the Zemstvo authorities proved 
fruitless. An American detachment sent by Gen. 
Graves to Habarovsk to prevent the murder of a 
number of Russians by Kalmikoff was foiled by the 
crafty ataman. The repeated warnings of the Allies 
were unavailing. And to the admonition of Colonel 
Butenko, Kolchak's military commandant of Vladi- 
vostok, the ataman replied with a degree of arro- 
gance that hardly left a doubt but that the small 
band was backed by a much stronger power. 

I asked myself: Why do the Kalmikoff Cos- 
sacks commit these atrocious acts? They can- 
not have hope for real power in Siberia. They 
are few in number and despised by the other cossack 
bands. They are hated, naturally, by the popula- 
tion. How does the band maintain itself? They 
do not rob to any appreciable extent. Who feeds 
Kalmikoff and his men? Who pays them? I pro- 
ceeded to ask the same questions of Zemstvo officials, 
of Kolchak officers and, what was more to the point, 
of Kalmikoff's Cossacks themselves. And the answer 
came uniformly Japan ! Japan was maintaining

the band for the laudable and legitimate purpose of 
killing Bolsheviki. 

The name of Bolshevik being almost equivalent to 
a death sentence in Siberia, the Japanese were not 
always above threatening to brand as Bolsheviki 
persons who complained against their activities. The 
Manager of the Russian Volunteer Fleet turned 
over in the beginning of December to the Commissar 
of the Maritime Province Kolchak's appointee a 
protocol of the Posieta Township, setting forth a 
number of grievances against the Japanese. Upon 
this, the Japanese threatened the complaining per- 
sons, including the agent of the Volunteer Fleet, 
with deportation from their homes as Bolsheviki. 

The killing of Bolsheviki was considered in 
Siberia, except by the Americans, as both a whole- 
some sport and a legitimate business. Under the 
heading of Bolshevik-killing, therefore, the Japanese 
found it convenient to classify such indiscriminate 
murders as those described below. 

The following telegram, dated at Prohasko, was 
received by Medviedyeff, the Chairman of the Mari- 
time Zemstvo, from the Zemstvo of the Tihonoff 
Township ; copies of the telegram were sent to the 
military authorities and the Allied Consulates at 
Vladivostok: "On the soth of September, at 3 P. 
M., at the Station of the 36th verst, at the switching- 
point of Busse, Foma Orchenko and Anton Suhin, 
citizens of the -Nevskaya Village, were brutally shot 
by order of the Japanese Command. They had come 
to apply for employment from the foreman of the 
railway repair shops. Upon investigation it was 
made clear that the victims were innocent of any 
crime, and that their death had been inflicted with- 
out legitimate reason by the Japanese Command. 
On the first of October the bodies were buried by 
'the Japanese. The relations of the fallen men re- 
quest that the bodies be re-interred according to the 
Christian custom. Am awaiting your orders. I 
beg that you take the necessary measures." 

"What have you done about it?" I asked M. 
Medviedyeff. 

"Your question embarrasses me," he replied, sadly. 
" Don't you see that I am helpless? We, the elected 
administration, count for nothing now. The Ja- 
panese have no respect whatever for our laws and 
customs. They entered our country as friends, and 
they behave as conquerors." 

" Perhaps that Tihonoff place is tainted with 
Bolshevism?" 

" It isn't. The regularly elected Zemstvo offi- 
cials administer the affairs of the township, and 
the population, which consists of farmers, is peace- 
ful and law abiding. Here, I'll prove it to you." 

And he handed me a communication which read 
as follows: 

" The Tihonoff Village Assembly, having con- 
sidered the political questions of the moment, has 
resolved : Owing to the fact that only an adminis- 
tration regularly elected by all the citizens can lead 
our locality out of its difficult circumstances, we de- 
clare our recognition of the Temporary Siberian 



Government, and demand that the Siberian Duma 
and the All-Russian Constituent Assembly be con- 
vened as soon as possible." 

" You will note," added M. Medviedyeff, " that 
the people who passed this resolution are the same 
people that sent the telegram denouncing the mur- 
ders." 

" That looks pretty straight," I said. " What is 
the attitude of the Allied Consular Corps? " 

" Oh, well, what can you expect ? Diplomats 
are not in the habit of scrapping. And since the 
Corps here, which includes the Japanese, is com- 
posed of friends and allies. . . ." He concluded 
with a hopeless gesture of the hand. 

DIVIDE ET IMPERA 

The Bolsheviki were not the only group in Siberia 
against whom the activities of the Japanese were 
directed, nor the Kalmikoff cossacks their only con- 
federates. When Vladivostok was taken on June 
29 by the Czechoslovaks, it was the Japanese 
who encouraged and assisted them. The immediate 
result of this act was to put the Bolshevik Soviets 
out of business and to re-establish the Zemstvos. 

Had the Japanese stopped at that, Siberia might 
have been by now a peaceful, and even a prosperous 
country. But the Zemstvo officials had no sooner 
resumed their proper places than the Japanese began 
to encourage the rising faction of an autocracy with 
Kolchak at its head. Within the space of four 
months the authority of the elected adminis- 
tration was completely undermined. The rising 
power of Kolchak called forth a renewal of riots 
and bloodshed throughout the country. The mod- 
erate and law-abiding elements of the population 
were driven to despair by a program of unpre- 
cedented oppression and repression. And all the 
time the Cossacks were making confusion worse 
confounded. In the disorder which resulted from 
pitting every faction against every other faction, the 
Japanese saw their opportunity to help themselves to 
Siberia. They kept the waters of political and eco- 
nomic life in Siberia muddy in order to catch fish. 

By the end of January the people of Siberia, and 
whatever shadow was left of their elected represen- 
tative government, saw the utter futility of protests 
and complaints relative to the behavior of Japanese 
troops and merchants. On the agth of that month 
the Zemstvo of the Maritime Province made a cul- 
minating attempt to prove to the Allies the necessity 
of 'being on guard against Japan in the Far East. 

" What will happen," asks the Zemstvo in the 
course of a long published argument, " if in the Far 
East a new Balkan-States-system arises out of 
Siberia, and a new Austro-Germany in the form of 
Japan ? Will the fault lie with Japan alone, or will 
a great part of it lie with other powers, shortsighted 
and busy with unessential diplomacies? " Unhap- 
pily the question was put in Russian. It stands 
mighty little chance of being understood or answered 
by any of the Allies.

A FORTNIGHTLY 



The Old Order and the New 



UT OF THE WAR TO END WAR HAS COME THE 

peace to end peace. With the passing of time, sor- 
row for the failure of the first-named enterprise 
tends increasingly to lose itself in elation over a 
second failure over the sheer inability of the 
peacemakers of Paris to put everywhere into prac- 
tice their plan for the partition and the exploita- 
tion of the world. Liberals who support the Treaty 
and the Covenant have said that these documents 
do not anywhere provide means for the suppres- 
sion of internal movements for industrial and social 
revolution. It does however appear that an alli- 
ance has been perfected between Great Britain, 
the United States, France, Japan, and Italy. And 
it is likewise sufficiently plain that this alliance 
has as one of its chief objects the partitioning, 
among its members, of the more backward portions 
of the earth, now called mandatories. To the 
calloused occidental mind there is nothing very 
terrible about this scheme of things, familiar already 
under the name of colonial exploitation. Indeed 
it begins only now to appear that a system evolved 
for application to backward peoples, is already 
being applied, in its essence, to forward nations 
also. It has always been an international crime 
for a people to have great possessions and a dark 
skin, but only recently has it been considered equally 
heinous to have advanced ideas and to act on them. 
Conceivably a communist revolution might 
have occurred somewhere in Europe in ante-bellum 
days; but only in a world remade by the war and 
ruled by the League are red Russia and black 
Rhodesia subjected to the same treatment. A back- 
ward country tempts capitalism to new gains, but a 
forward country threatens the very existence of the 
system that makes such gains possible. Thus the 
hope of the world today lies in Russia's resistance 
to the new Paris verdict, rather than in India's 
restlessness under an old sentence, and China's 
under a new one. 



TOR MONTHS THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS HAS HAD 

in making two bodies of law the statutes pub- 
lished in the Treaty and the Covenant, and the 
common law embodied in secret decisions enforced 
at the ends of the earth by bayonets that write 
more plainly than official pens. First and foremost 
among the statutes of the League are those that 
provide for the partition and exploitation of the 
earth. To supplement this Imperial Code of aggres- 
sion, there has been developed a common law doc- 



trine of defense that the established system of 
private property must be preserved at all costs. 
Whoever doubts that this is as truly a law of the 
League as any of its statutes may profitably observe 
what threatens in Mexico, and what is already hap- 
pening in Hungary and in Russia. The last named 
and greatest offender against the League is con- 
demned to dismemberment and the League is in 
process of executing the sentence. French and 
British 'imperialism, already dominant from the 
Bosphorus to Thibet, is surging ambitiously against 
the elastic boundaries of South Russia and Siberia; 
will Denikin and Kolchak dare to set a limit to 
this advance? The West, like the South, has its 
line of clamorous creditors Finland, Poland, and 
the lesser states between demanding to be paid in 
Russian lands. But it is at the other extreme of 
the Eurasian continent that the climax of impe- 
rialist generosity has been reached. Eastern 
Siberia goes to Japan. There is no mistaking the 
fact that by the purchase of depreciated properties, 
by armed occupation and the pilfering of the plans 
of Siberia's defenses, perhaps even by placating 
promises to withdraw from Shantung, Japan is con- 
solidating and extending her possessions in north- 
eastern Asia to such an extent that she will pres- 
ently shut Russia off from the Pacific Ocean. 
Korea, Manchuria, Siberia and the thing is done. 
Thus we turn to the Prussians of the Orient for 
proof that there has at last been developed under 
the League a type of international unity that de- 
fies race prejudice and makes the yellow man and 
the white man comrades at arms in the war on 
industrial democracy. 



1 HE SIBERIAN RAILROAD is NOT ONLY THE 
main artery of transportation in Siberia, but it 
is the only open access to European Russia as well. 
. . . The population of Western Siberia and 
the forces of Admiral Kolchak are entirely depend- 
ent upon these railways." Reduced thus to its es- 
sential sentences, the President's explanation of the 
presence of our troops in Siberia proves to be not 
only the latest but altogether the wittiest of Wil- 
sonian pleasantries. What does the President mean 
when he says that the Siberian Railway is " the 
only open access to European Russia?" The Black 
Sea and the Baltic and the White are just as 
open as the Siberian Railway for the transportation 
of supplies and reinforcements to the enemies of 
Soviet Russia. And the Siberian Railway, guarded

by American troops (8,000) and Japanese troops 
(100,000 or so), is just as tightly closed to ship- 
ments of food to the communist area as are the 
Russian ports, guarded by British and French 
troops and gunboats. That this blockade is illegal 
is entirely beside the point. On July 9 the Lon- 
don Daily Herald published a dispatch from a 
Paris correspondent reading in part as follows: 

The blockade of Russia is to be raised immediately the 
German Peace is ratified. The Blockade Commission ad- 
vised the Big Four that its continuance would be impossible 
under international law, since no state of war exists with 
Russia, and since the agreements with neutral States, on 
which the present blockade depends, will lapse with the 
ending of the German war. . . . The Big Four ac- 
cepted the inevitable, and signed a document ordering 
that on the ratification by Germany of the Treaty of 
Versailles, all positive measures of interference with 
Russian trade must cease. 

On July 10 a supplementary statement from the 
same correspondent appeared in the Herald; the 
opening paragraph read thus: 

The blockade against Russia and Hungary has been 
ordered to be raised by the Supreme Economic Council as 
soon as the Treaty is ratified and the ban against the 
Central Empires lifted. I can now state positively that 
the order of the Economic Council has received the neces- 
sary signatures, and exists as a legal bulwark against the 
enemies of the Russian and Magyar masses. 

A Paris dispatch published in the New York 
Times for July 17 stated that "the developments 
in the resumed meetings of the [Supreme] Council 
show that it is not intended to permit a free flow 
of food and other supplies into that large portion 
of Russia controlled by the Lenine administration." 
How effective the action of the Council has been 
is shown in another dispatch (Times, July 26) 
dealing with the work of the American Relief Ad- 
ministration in the Baltic Region. To quote: 

There is sufficient American food available in the Gulf 
of Finland to supply Petrograd and its suburbs for three 
months, but the lack of coordination of allied assistance 
to^the Western Russian Army and to the Esthonians oper- 
ating in conjunction with it is declared to be preventing 
the movement upon Petrograd from progressing with suf- 
ficient speed to effect relief much before Winter, as things 
stand now. 

It appears then that, at the best, American food 
follows the flag of the counter-revolutionary armies, 
while at the worst our troops maintain the mili- 
tary railroad which brings life to the forces of 
reaction. 



IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT CERTAIN ITEMS OF 

interest did not find their way into the President's 
message on Siberia such items as the following: 

From official source? we are informed that the government 
of the United States of America has given to the Omsk 
Government a credit of one million dollars. One million 
dollars more is expected; the government of the United 
States has already declared its consent. 

If Galos Primoria (June 18, 1919), the Kolchak 



organ of Vladivostok, had been fully aware of the 
intricacies of American statecraft, this item would 
surely have been censored out of existence. But as 
it is, we feel compelled to ask Mr. Wilson to state 
" if it is not incompatible with public interest " 
where this money came from and by what authority 
it is used to aid counter-revolution in Russia. On 
June 12 this same Siberian paper printed another 
item of more than passing interest an American 
Army order addressed to the striking workmen of 
Soutchan, Siberia: 

WARNING ! 

When I took the place of commander of Soutchan I was 
told that the workmen of the mines do not work because 
of the agitators. I intend to defend all the mine workers 
from external influence. I will consider all menaces from 
outside, and all interferences, as disorderly conduct, and 
any person or persons who so act will be punished, or 
sent to Shotovo for trial. This agitation must be sus- 
pended ; I ask all to support and obey my orders. You 
must know that if you do not work you will suffer from 
hunger. If you do not fulfill my orders you will be 
deported. 

(Signed) Major F. B. Alderdice. 

1 Adjutant D. L. Bressler. 
June 4, 1919. 

The paper remarks elsewhere that crews made up 
partly of Chinese laborers have been engaged to 
work in some of the mines of Soutchan, under the 
protection of patrols of soldiers. American dollars 
finance the counter-revolution. American soldiers 
protect Chinese strike-breakers in Siberian mines. 
And over it all, like butterflies over a battlefield, 
flutter the President's phrases. 



ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE BOLSHEVIKI 

should be starved is that they are bent on destroying 
the family. It is said that they have nationalized 
the women and institutionalized the children of 
Russia. The first of these two myths has been 
disposed of and re-disposed of until it has be- 
come a propagandist chestnut. The second is as 
easily handled, now that the facts are known. A 
traveler just returned from Petrograd brings some 
interesting information acquired during a personal 
inspection of the children's institutions of that city. 
The scarcity of food, caused by the blockade, is the 
chief reason for the widespread inability of parents 
to keep their families intact. No child is received 
into the Petrograd institutions until the case has 
been studied and reported upon by professional 
social workers representing the institution, by a 
committee of neighbors of the family, and by a sec- 
ond committee representing the citizens of the 
political district in which the family resides. Meas- 
ured by the standards of the Charity Organization 
Society of New York, such an investigation is more 
than adequate. Similarly, many of the Russian 
institutions compare most favorably with those of 
highly civilized countries. In the matter of food 
distribution an earnest and successful effort has been 
made to secure to the children of the city a major 



1919 



THE DIAL 



share of the supply. These measures have done 
much to keep down child mortality in the face of 
the blockade, although ten per cent of the adults 
of Petrograd are partly disabled by malnutrition, 
and an additional ten per cent are confined to bed 
from the same cause that is to say, starvation. 
The process of careful apportionment of food be- 
comes meaningless, however, when the supply of 
a given article is entirely exhausted; THE DIAL 
has first-hand information that there are sick babies 
in the hospitals of Petrograd for whom no milk what- 
ever can be had. And at Jamburg, seventy miles 
southwest of Petrograd, are the officers of the Ameri- 
can Relief Administration, safe within the counter- 
revolutionary lines, while in the Gulf of Finland 
" there is sufficient American food available to 
supply Petrograd and its suburbs for three months." 
Whose war is this anyhow this war for the pres- 
ervation of the family? And above all, whose 
blockade ? 



Jr ROM THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW THE 
exploitation of backward peoples is of three kinds. 
American capital operates at home with cheap im- 
ported labor; this situation obtained in California 
until Asiatic immigration was stopped. Or Amer- 
can capital operates abroad with cheap native labor; 
this situation holds in the Tampico oil fields. Or 
foreign capital operates abroad with cheap native 
labor; this situation exists in all the formal and 
informal grants under the League of Nations. 
American labor has in times past felt the direct 
pressure of the first of these three forms of exploita- 
tion, and has protested loudly against Asiatic, South 
European, and Mexican immigration. Against the 
use of our army to protect the foreign ventures of 
American capital labor has likewise protested, 
though with less vigor. But the newest and most 
astonishing form of exploitation is that now prac- 
ticed in foreign grants by foreign capital; from 
such enterprises America reaps no sort of profit 
unless the broadening experience of her soldiers in 
the service of foreign imperialism may be considered 
profitable and yet the American Federation of 
Labor has indorsed the League of Nations. Our 
Republican Senators have taken a more reasonable 
position. No amount of beautiful language can 
persuade them that we ought to share the burden 
of maintaining a system of world imperialism when 
we do not at the same time share the harvest. Even 
the exquisite technique of secret conferences, im- 
ported from Paris by Mr. Wilson, has not yet won 
these gentlemen over. However these is one means 
by which we may yet be rescued from our ridiculous 
position as non-participating stockholders in the 
League. A little note to England: another one to 
France ; a confidential word in a Senator's ear 
then let the League be adopted and the invasion of 
Mexico begin. Is this what our imperialists are 
holding out for? 



1 HROUGHOUT EUROPE A GENERAL STRIKE WAS 

called for July 20 and 21. It resulted only in a 
few local tieups and stoppages, and the fuse of revo- 
lution fizzled into silence. That is the impression 
of the movement toward international labor solidar- 
ity which one gains in the American press. As a 
tally of intentions and results it has the typical 
journalistic merit of complying with editorial 
wishes by playing fast and loose with facts. In the 
first place a general strike was not called in France, 
Italy, and Great Britain; what was decided upon 
at the Southport Conference was a general demon- 
stration, " in the form best adapted to the circum- 
stances and the methods in operation in each coun- 
try." The purpose of these demonstrations was 
to manifest international solidarity and goodwill. 
In no portion of this resolution was there the 
threat of an international general strike: the 
whole wording shows on the contrary that none of 
the labor groups wished to inflict hardship or to 
court failure by premature action, by attempting to 
take over an international mechanism which they 
did not have the force to put into effective opera- 
tion at this early moment. The demonstration was 
planned merely as a preliminary step toward organ- 
ization. Now what was the outcome of this pre- 
liminary exertion of pressure without recourse to 
the general strike? In Italy, despite the absence 
of an overt revolutionary mandate, if we accept 
the earliest press reports dealing with the situa- 
tion, the mere threat of action was enough to 
wring from the government all that the South- 
port conference suggested in the resolution reported 
by The Daily Herald (London) for June 28: 
namely, according to the New York Times for July 
20, the recall of Italian troops from foreign service 
in Russia and Hungary, the hastening of demobiliza- 
tion and the breakup of the supreme military com- 
mand; the liberation of political prisoners on a 
large scale; and the restriction of profiteering in 
the necessities of life. What more could a strike 
have obtained without the complete political cap- 
ture of the state? That British labor is likely to 
use industrial action to the same end is shown in 
the decision of the Triple Alliance to submit a 
referendum on a general strike against conscrip- 
tion. Whatever the weakness of international 
labor cooperation, due to the unequal develop- 
ments of the movement in the various countries, it 
is plain that labor groups have at hand a weapon by 
which they may potently influence the conduct of 
their own government. By exercizing that influence 
they will be able to control indirectly the counter 
revolutionary operations of the league. 



SUPPOSE THE COVENANT is REJECTED. WHAT 
will follow? Chaos! answer the liberals who 
have not yet awakened from the pleasant trance of 
Wilsonian formulae to confront the realities which 
underlie the documents. Public law will be under-

mined ; public order will cease to exist. Thus these 
liberals. Mr. Herbert Hoover however is more 
candid and less disconcerting. The New York 
Times for July 28 quotes him as saying that " to 
abandon the Covenant now means that the treaty 
itself will collapse." When Mr. Hoover said this 
he may have fancied that he was sounding the 
siren of alarm; but second thought will show that 
this is the most hopeful remark that has been made 
about the international situation since General 
Smuts had the courage to append his reservations to 
the signature he affixed to the Peace Treaty. The 
present covenant is not an instrument for creating 
a new comity in the relations of states: it is a 
mechanism for perpetuating the preponderance of 
military power exercised by certain allied and asso- 
ciated imperialisms. With the Peace Treaty in 
view, the idea of public right is subordinated in the 
Covenant to the idea of economic and military ex- 
pediency. What makes the Covenant indefensible 
is the Peace Treaty; what makes the present treaty 
inimical to the processes of pacification is the Cov- 
enant. The rejection of the Covenant would strike 
a blow at the Peace Treaty, for it would leave it 
without the necessary political and military means 
of fulfillment. What then ? Chaos ! The pro- 
visions of the treaty would be flouted. There 
would be dissensions, renewals of warfare, and a 
more drastic series of peace terms written (if need 
be) by France and Italy alone. But this is the un- 
thinkable possibility, unthinkable because it does not 
recognize the collapse of an artificially stimulated 
war morale, and the increasing political and indus- 
trial recovery of the European labor groups. The 
erstwhile belligerents have only by now sufficiently 
cooled off to be able to write an unprovocative 
Peace Treaty, more equitable in its demands, less 
prehensile in its exactions, and less in need of a 
vigilant military coalition to enforce its terms. The 
mood of belligerency has evaporated, and there is 
an opportunity to express in a revised treaty a 
correspondingly dispassionate state of mind. The 
enforcement of the Peace Treaty through the in- 
strumentality of the Covenant would stereotype the 
relations of the master states to the subject states, 
and the conditions that would favor a revision would 
be absent. Its collapse on the other hand would 
result in the disruption of an imperialism whose 
aims are inimical to any sort of peace, order, justice, 
or liberty except that which exists within the bour- 
geois oligarchies of the West. The sort of chaos 
which this would involve seems antecedent to the 
establishment of any secure and decent system of 
public right. Better a passing disorder than an order 
which makes injustice and illiberalism permanent. 

THE RACE RIOTS IN WASHINGTON, CHICAGO, AND 
elsewhere must not be regarded merely as incidental 
outbreaks of hoodlumism. They are a local aspect 
of that wider problem of races which rose into 
prominence less than 'a hundred years ago. It is a 



problem which the Negro question in America only 
accentuates in the brutality and irrationality of its 
treatment. What conditions hamper diverse races 
from meeting freely on the same economic and 
social planes? We have yet to make a complete 
and candid inquiry into this subject. That we have 
failed however is no occasion for puzzlement ; for 
the forces that brought the yellow man, the brown, 
and the black, within the scope of Western civiliza- 
tion have been barely a hundred years in operation. 
It is too early to expect the problem to be solved, 
but it is at least time that it should be stated. 

What is needed, first of all, is an analysis that 
will separate contemporary economic inequalities 
from the more permanent underlying anthropological 
and social elements. Part of the American prej- 
udice against the Negro has no other ground than 
the dislike of the medieval townsman for the Jew, 
or the California landholder for the Japanese. In 
these cases racial antagonism is simply a mask for 
concealing the dislike of an established economic 
class for a rival group which aspires to throw off its 
status of menial subjection. Where the Negro has 
no inferior economic place to fill, as in Ancient 
Greece or modern France, he is treated with sym- 
pathy, cordiality, and good will ; and is not badgered 
into " keeping his place " on account of a supposedly 
innate psychological or cultural incapacity. The 
remedy for race intolerance, in so far as it is based 
upon the superstition of natural servitude, is eco- 
nomic equality. It is by establishing his economic 
independence, and not by physical recalcitrance, 
that the Negro will be able to create respect for 
himself as a member of the human race, instead of 
being dubiously tolerated as the member of a per- 
haps dangerous subject people. 

This however does not dispose of the racial ques- 
tion as a whole: it merely does away with the eco- 
nomic aspect of it. Apart from the economic 
motives of- exploitation we have still to discover 
whether there are any grounds for erecting barriers 
against the natural movements of population from 
China, Japan, India, and Africa to regions in- 
habited by the multifariously hybrid white man. 

What has historical anthropology to say about 
the mingling of races in the past? What has ex- 
perimental eugenics to say about racial, character- 
istics, the terms of their transmission, the extent to 
which they mingle or retain the attribute of units. 
What has ethnology to say about the relation of 
race to culture? Is there enough critically tested 
data to assure us of the innocuousness of a thorough- 
going process of racial intermixture, to the extent 
that a man might have a Nordic grandfather, a 
Chinese grandmother, a Negroid mother, and a 
Semitic father? If not, what at the present stage 
of our knowledge would seem a prudent limitation ? 
Questions of this sort are fundamental to a scien- 
tific political approach to the race problem. Until 
we are prepared to answer them the glib human- 
itarian and the bestial hoodlum will hold the field 
with their respective " solutions." 



THE DIAL 



Casual Comment 

THE ESSENTIAL PROSTITUTION IN POPULAR 

writing has rarely been so glaringly manifest as it is 
manifest in The Gibson Upright, a play by Booth 
Tarkington and Harry Leon Wilson, just pub- 
lished serially in the Saturday Evening Post and 
announced for fall publication by Doubleday, Page 
and for Broadway production next season. The 
piece is a party plea for the Old Order in indus- 
try that well-nigh vanished old order of open 
competition, individual .initiative, thrift, and benev- 
olent paternalism so futilely dreamt about in an- 
other Mr. Wilson's unlamented New Freedom. 
The scene is laid in a manufacturing backwater, 
an inherited little factory, owned and managed by 
the Utopianly just and benevolent son of its Vic- 
torian founder a piano factory that has main- 
tained itself outside the " syndicate " by substituting 
for its former product ("a very fine piano and 
only a few of them ") the Gibson Upright, made 
" on a quantity-production basis " to sell at $188 
and enough of them made by 175 laborers to pay 
$50,000 a year in profits to the younger Gibson! 
Gibson happens to be blest with miraculous knowl- 
edge of where to buy raw materials and relies 
on his own plant even for his celluloid key coat- 
ing. Probably no such anachronistic factory exists 
or could exist; $188 pianos are "assembled" from 
ready-made parts, and the assembling factories are 
subservient cogs in an intricate industrial organi- 
zation. 

Upon this initial, and woefully ignorant, misrep- 
resentation the authors have constructed an eco- 
nomic chimera fantastically adapted to their prej- 
udices- and to their dramatic necessities. The 
laborers are made as preposterously stupid and can- 
tankerously grasping as their employer is omni- 
sciently shrewd and exasperatingly generous. The 
theme seems to be the familiar and utterly unsub- 
stantiated one that the more you " give " labor the 
more it will demand and the nastier it will be 
about its exactions. (The converse is shirked.) 
Facing strikes thus motivated in every department, 
interviewed by an " ignorant idealist " deliberately 
got up to burlesque the hypothetical " bolshevik " 
journalist, and rebuffed as a " capitalist " by the 
girl of his choice, a disagreeable copy of the Rus- 
sian worker-agitator, young Gibson turns the man- 
agement of his factory over to his employees, re- 
taining only his title and, incidentally, his indis- 
pensable secret knowledge of the materials market. 
Before the curtain falls on the first act they are 
paying $2 a thousand more than they need to for 
lumber, substituting management by guesswork for 
management by magic. And after that, of course, 
the deluge prompt restoration of inequality be- 
cause certain feeble-minded workers sell their shares 
at a discount, labor troubles with the " wops " 
the new capitalists have hired to work their pur- 
chased shares, too early division of hypothetical 
profits, no business management and no sales, 



squabbles, insolvency, joyful reversion to Mr. Gib- 
son. Everywhere the blind stupidity that is 
possible to average men and women only in Post 
fiction and on the Broadway stage. 



NOWHERE IN THE GIBSON UPRIGHT is THERE 
even accidental intimation of the real problems 
that, in the present industrial scene, would sur- 
round such an experiment in democratic control. 
Nowhere the faintest gleam of open-mindedness or 
dispassionate investigation. Gibson, moved more 
by love than by social justice, in sheer petulance 
deserts a factory his employees do not deserve 
and cannot operate and, again moved by love, 
pays a $17,000 deficit to get it back. The eco- 
nomics of the authors is exposed in a choice moment. 
Asked whether he thinks himself worth $50,000 a 
year to his business, Gibson produces as crushing 
proof a $50,000 salary offer from a competitor 
query: what is the rate of return on his capital? 
Such is the unabashed ignorance of this propaganda 
on behalf of a supposititious " existing order " that 
ceased to exist on any considerable scale almost be- 
fore its principles were formulated by economists. 
The thing would be comical were it not so vicious. 
It could pass with a grin if Messrs. Tarkington 
and Wilson were merely having the rather taste- 
less fun with radicals that. Mr. Sinclair Lewis 
was having with Bohemians in his Hobohemia 
produced, appropriately, at the Greenwich Village 
Theater. But the Gibson Upright is not farce 
that is, by intention. In it One of our most suc- 
cessful novelists and perhaps our most successful 
humorist have entertainingly and profitably re- 
flected back to the myriad readers of our most 
widely circulated weekly, and will reflect to as 
many purchasers of the book and as many auditors 
of the play as they can decoy, the bourgeois passions 
and prejudices of the hour. That they may be, 
and probably are, honest in their ignorance and in- 
nocent of deception scarcely lightens the picture. 
They have administered a soothing syrup to the 
wakening suspicion that perhaps all is not well in 
our order; they have contributed to that dangerous 
state of mind compact of smug ignorance and 
fatuous aversion to change whose prejudices re- 
sist the rational and amicable impulses toward 
social readjustment, and encourage the irrational 
and violent. And their contribution will be more 
welcome to the interested parties than if it had 
been ordered, censored, paid for, and distributed as 
a Tory document in a modern War of the Pam- 
phlets. In fact the most significant, and equally the 
most disturbing, distinction between the Grub 
Street pamphleteer and the Broadway success is 
this: the valuable pamphleteer, who usually knew 
better than he did, received for his thirty pieces a 
precarious insurance against starvation; whereas 
the innocence of his American successor will keep 
him on the fat of the land. And where ignor- 
ance is bliss

JP RENCH THOUGHT AND FRENCH JOURNALISM 

have lately brought out a magazine, unique and ad- 
mirable, Le Progres Civique. It is a journal of po- 
litical criticism and social improvement. By itself 
this is not a distinction. What makes Le Progres 
Civique a singular institution to Anglo-American 
eyes is that the weight of its contents is mitigated 
by a journalistic levity in typography and makeup. No 
weeklies or fortnightlies in English have achieved 
the combination. The Liberator, for example, en- 
joys the same pictorial enlivenment as Le Progres 
Civique, and might conceivably adopt its editorial 
catchlines and its boldfaced footnotes; but it could 
hardly live by the motto " Never pa'rtisan ! . . . 
Never neutral!" nor would it be likely to enlist such 
a diverse company of contributors as Marcel Sem- 
bat, the socialist; Pierre Hamp, the laborist; and 
Charles Brun, the regionalist. On the other hand 
Le Progres Civique dares to dissociate the dignity 
of learning from the dignity of dress, and it takes off 
its coat and gesticulates and stamps its emphasis 
with a vehemence which the stodgier traditions of 
our own more gentlemanly and suave journalism do 
not permit. Does this account partly for its ready 
popularity, for the fact that more than eighty thous- 
and copies of the first issue were disposed of, at one 
franc a copy? In America the popular magazines 
alone have the typographic boldness of Le Progres 
Civique: does their success mean that the literary 
and political journals must eventually follow its ex- 
ample? As if partly in answer to this question the 
National Municipal Review appeared a little while 
ago with a new policy, a new editor, and an every- 
month issue; and while the change is indicated 
chiefly by a new colloquial tone in the editorials, 
it is only a short step from this to the adoption of a 
more modern makeup. If there is a question how- 
ever as to whether intellectual dignity or typo- 
graphical dignity must be sacrificed in the interest 
of a wider circulation, it is our opinion that the first 
quality must be maintained at all costs. A literary 
style should fit the subject matter primarily, and 
only incidentally the audience. The repulsive 
familiarity of contemporary popular journalism is 
symptomatic not of democratic sympathies but of 
downright condescension. The worst demagogue 
is he who flatters his inferiors by pretending to be 
their equal. That quality of demagogery slashes 
like a yellow streak through American journalism. 
It is an offense that Le Progres Civique, which 
courts popularity without condescension, may well 
show us how to avoid. 

hSooMALACA, CONGO, JULY 22 (DELAYED IN 
transmission). Immediate armed intervention in the 
United States of America was decided upon at an 
extraordinary session of the Council of Ten to- 
night. The object of this drastic action on the part 
of the League of Unfree Nations is the protection ol 
the lives and property of African citizens now resi- 
dent in the United States, and the establishment and 



maintenance of a stable government in that coun- 
try. An official high in diplomatic circles stated 
after the close of the meeting that the League pro- 
posed to grant to Liberia a mandate over those por- 
tions of the United States where the population is 
predominantly of the Congo race, with the idea of 
first putting an end- to the pogroms which have of 
late become so frequent, and of arranging eventu- 
ally for the determination by plebiscite of the de- 
sires of the population as to their future national 
adherence. It is said that in this manner the world 
will be made safe for diplomacy. No official con- 
firmation of these statements had been obtained up 
to a late hour tonight. 

At the opening of the session of the Council, King 
Hahhah read a dispatch from the Washington 
representative of the Liberian Tribe Department in 
which it was stated that soldiers and sailors in uni- 
form were attacking African citizens on the streets 
of the American capital. Prince Hodge Podge 
stated it as his opinion, based on long and careful 
study of all the evidence in hand, that these out- 
rages had been encouraged by the Wilsonist ad- 
ministration. The Prince even suggested the possi- 
bility that an alliance exists between the Wilsonist 
faction and the Empeyistas. General Bulbo offered 
the opinion that the present unstable condition 
of the American government and the prevalence 
of lawlessness could not be excused on the ground 
that there was a revolution in America a hundred 
and forty-four years ago. The General explained 
that ever since the suspension of the hostilities caused 
by the imperialistic expansion of the Abyssinia in 
the Nile Valley, the Congo General Staff had been 
preparing plans for the invasion of the United 
States. He was of the opinion that the discontent 
now rife in the hunting and fishing centers of Africa 
would be relieved by another war, and that the 
resumption of military operations would bring pros- 
perity in business. Mr. B. B. Babboon emphasized 
the fact that only by securing the establishment of a 
stable government in the United States could the 
Congo be assured of the supply of gee strings and 
cigarettes so necessary to her industrial progress.

WHAT Is AMERICA? By Edward Allsworth 
Ross. 159 pages. Century. 

What Is America? is the question that the census 
answers decennially, in many large and bulky 
volumes. Professor Ross has realized the unpopu- 
larity of these complete and authoritative statistics, 
and he has conceived the happy notion of engross- 
ing a part of them and presenting them as a socio- 
logical analysis of the American nation. Where 
Professor Ross follows the census humbly, as in his 
demographic maps and tables, his little hand-book 
is not without interest for those unacquainted with 
the original sources; but it cannot be said that the 
comments that bind these charts together add very 
much to the illumination. In default of critical 
analysis Professor Ross offers opinions which have 
the defect of platitude without the merit of truth. 
" The federal government is erected upon the 
people, not upon the states." Is that a realistic 
analysis of the underlying community to the state? 
Professor Ross alleges that the monthly magazines 
which are published in New York or Boston " so 
far as local bias goes, might as well be edited on 
Pike's Peak." Does that touch off the preponderant 
influence the financial capital of America has had 
upon foreign and domestic policy by means of the 
periodical press? Again, in surveying the country- 
side the author observes that " typical of America 
is the independent farmer living on his own farm." 
How does this jibe with the statement four pages 
later that farm tenancy has increased from 25.6 per 
cent of all the farmers in 1880 to 37 per cent in 
1910? Professor Ross openly set out to " vindicate 
and commend " the virtuous democracy alluded to 
in the Virginia Bill of Right of 1776. It is hardly 
an act of piety to the dead to answer the question 
"What is America?" by glibly retailing what 
America is not. 

BISMARCK. By C. Grant Robertson. 539 
pages. Holt. 

> No subject would make an easier polemic at this 
time than a life of Bismarck. But Mr. Robertson 
has the good taste to refrain from dusting his picture 
with patronizing excuses or pious recriminations, nor 
does he cheapen it by pointing the moral of Bis- 
marck's career straight at the present day. The pic- 
ture is first and foremost a portrait of the politician. 
But, as the politician rounds into form, we notice a 
sketch of the man taking shape behind the politician, 
and as the man gains in solidity, we see emerging an 
outline of the whole system which the man created. 
What was Bismarck's chief work? It was the re- 
placement of sentimental politics by Realpolitik. In 
fine, it was the feat of lifting an old structure from 
crumbling foundations and setting it on more mod- 
ern and much stronger ones. For Bismarck abol- 
ished the old absolutism grounded on dynastic whims 



and replaced it with an absolutism grounded on the 
scientific exploitation of the people. He set the 
Prussian ruling class in an imposing edifice of which 
the reinforced concrete was the systematic coordi- 
nation of industrial, commercial, and political power. 
Of that host of diplomats, politicians, and semi-di- 
vine-right princelings and potentates who played the 
mock-heroic game of the Balance of Power, Bis- 
marck was the Hercules. No individual overcame 
him. The two reverses he met with were adminis- 
tered by great systems. The first reverse, inflicted 
by the Roman Church, was a check rather than a de- 
'feat. But the second, inflicted by the Imperial sys- 
tem he had created, was a knock-out. Mr. Robert- 
son's work, based on insight and sympathy, provides 
ample data for a judgment on Bismarck's value to 
Germany and to the world. It is a judgment no 
more to be ignored by a German than by an English- 
man or an American. 

THE DRY ROT OF SOCIETY AND OTHER 
ESSAYS. By Marion Cox. 158 pages. 
Brentano. 

In these essays on the psychology of the drunkard, 
the Lady in love and in war, the Gentleman in war, 
and the insanity of the German nation, Mrs. Cox 
(according to the advertisement) turns an "intellec- 
tual flashlight on the chaos of the times." Her epi- 
grams are often thought provoking and amusing. 
Most diverting is the characterization of the Lady in 
War " the female of our reigning plutocracy." 
War revealed the Lady, not as the lover and saviour 
of life, but as the knitting woman who counts the 
falling heads of pacifists and blasphemers of the god- 
head of war; as the passionate patrioteer, who 
roams at large in her new-found freedom of war, the 
chip of patriotism for her epaulet, so eager for the 
fray that, with her wild scent for the pro-German, 
she threatens to destroy the peace of every community 
of interests alien to her own." Seeking power in- 
stinctively, the Lady is without democracy in her 
cultural makeup. What then is the real trouble 
with Germany? Feminization. The femininity of 
Germany has been at grips with the masculinity of 
England, as typified by the English gentleman in 
war. He has the gift of getting under the other 
man's skin, whether white, yellow, or black, "to 
which delicate feat he owes his courtesy and his em- 
pire He just happened to run across his vast empire 
through an adventurous curiosity to meet and under- 
stand the strange folk of this pluralistic old planet" 
a pleasant way of phrasing the motives of economic 
imperialism! "The English conqueror makes le 
beau geste of liberation to the conquered, grasps his 
hand in honor of their mutual humanity, and then 
is worried ever afterwards how to do the right thing 
by him." This eulogy might make even an Anglo- 
maniac think of Ireland or India in 1919. Mrs. 
Cox's humor is submerged in this essay by her enthu- 
siasm, and humor takes its revenge at the end when 
she selects the Tank, an invention of English gentle-

CHRISTOPHER AND COLUMBUS. By the author 
of Elizabeth and Her German Garden. 435 
pages. Doubleday, Page. 

The sophisticated fiction reader who finds himself 
quickly and completely captivated by the ingenuous 
charm of this gay little story will feel somewhat like 
a blase and indulgent parent who has consented to 
take his youngster to the circus and finds that he 
himself has dropped a score of weary years outside 
the big top. It's a rare misanthrope who will not 
surrender to the fascinations of these irresponsible 
seventeen-year-old Twinkler twins, who romp 
through the best of -impossible worlds. Anna- 
Felicitas and Anna-Rose, have (for a reason) emi- 
grated from England to America, with two hundred 
pounds and a 'blissful ignorance of the world and 
its ways. Event piles upqn event in this unfamiliar 
land, and the spell of romance is upon all their ad- 
ventures. But under the protection of the not too 
fatherly Mr. Twist, inventor and manufacturer of 
Twist's Non-Trickier Teapot, " well known on 
every breakfast table," the young explorers sail 
through the perils of sea-sickness and the rough winds 
of offended and offensive Madame Grundys, past 
treacherous shoals of philanderers young and old, into 
the good harbor of matrimony. 

The style of this narrative is one of easy vivacity, 
and the gay make-believe is, quite spontaneous and 
unforced. Surely Lady Russell must have enjoyed 
the writing of her book as much as her readers 
will enjoy the reading of it. 

THE DOCTOR IN WAR. By Woods Hutchin- 
son. 481 pages. Houghtoo Mifflin. 

The Doctor in War by Woods Hutchinson is the 
first book dealing with the doctor in war, and is 
the result o<f Dr. Hutchinson's tour of the trenches 
and field hospitals from January 15 to December 24, 
1917, including three months in France, and four 
weeks on the Isonzo front. It contains much first 
hand information, which is vitiated in part by the 
fact that the author did not make his book deliber- 
ately enough, but slung together a series of articles 
which he had contributed to various periodicals. 
There is a vein of optimism which runs through 
the book, which is justified by the fact that the 
death rate in this war was only 3 per cent per annum, 
and that ninety per cent of the wounded were saved, 
and over eighty per cent were returned to the battle- 
field in less than four weeks. Some of the chapter 
headirigs such as The Land of the Happy Wounded 
and New Faces for Old, are a trifle Charlie Chap- 
linesque and would look well on the screen. Dr. 
Hutchinson vigorously attacks the vegetarian myth, 



says a good word for tea and coffee, and is enthusi- 
astic about the sports and amusements which pre- 
serve the soldiers' morale. He is so very, very 
optimistic in his treatment of the subject of the 
care of the wounded that it reminds one of the 
popular song, 

I'm in love with a beautiful nurse, 
I don't want to get well. 

and the reader unconsciously wishes that the genial 
doctor were able to write from a more personal ex- 
perience on this topic. He waxes enthusiastic over 
the Dayton-Carrel method of treatment, but neg- 
lects, mentioning other discoveries of equal import- 
ance. Although he pays a fitting tribute to the 
ambulance corps, he neglects to> stress the most 
significant development in modern warfare, getting 
men as far from the front lines as possible before 
operating on them. It is also unfortunate that 
Dr. Hutchinson says nothing of the services per- 
formed by the doctor in this country. The draft 
was made feasible by the work of doctors who 
volunteered for service, and in the camps the doctors 
performed a notable work in sanitation, prophylaxis 
and fighting epidemics. In dealing with the plague 
of influenza they participated in the greatest of 
battles that which perpetually takes place in the 
war against disease. 

MONEY AND PRICES. By J. Lawrence Laugh- 
lin. 307 pages. Scribner. 

The ripe experience of more than a generation's 
close association with the world's fiscal experiments 
stands behind and gives solidity to Prof. J.Lawrence 
Laughlin's concise addition to the many volumes 
on financial subjects which, in large part, clog the 
economic shelves of our libraries. In Money and 
Prices the author desires finally to set at rest the 
ancient discussion on 'the validity of the quantitative 
theory of prices, and to present a clear exposition of 
the relationship between the gold standard and the 
process by which prices are " made." While Prof. 
Laughlin does not maintain that the quantity of 
gold in a given locality has no influence on the 
fluctuations of price in that locality, he strongly 
emphasizes the fact that other influences of trade 
and commerce, and not gold, determine the price 
trend. By presenting the question as a ratio Professor 
Laughlin clarifies his argument. On the one side is 
the constantly increasing world supply of gold, 
whose tendency is to raise the general level of 
prices; on the other are various economic factors, 
such as labor saving devices, increased skill of man- 
agement, and other technical advances, which tend 
to reduce them. These latter, because they affect 
the immediate supply of commodities in the world 
at any given time in a far larger way than the 
yearly addition to the world's gold supply, are the 
real causes of price fluctuations. However, it cannot 
be denied that a sudden influx of gold into a small 
community, such as results when a new gold field is

THE POLITICS 
OF INDUSTRY 

By GLENN FRANK 

Co-author of "Stakes of the War," etc. 

A BOOK that will help the alert American to antici- 
pate and discount the social and industrial crises 
that are certain to develop in the near future. The 
papers that make up the volume are saij by many 
business and labor leaders who have read them to 
constitute the sanest and clearest statement yet made 
regarding the social unrest, the labor problem, and the 
part American business men may play in this period 
of readjustment following the war. 

The author says in his Foreword : " The statesmanship 
or stupidity of /business men is of more social significance 
than the statesmanship or stupidity of politicians. 
During the past year it has been my assignment and my 
pleasure to try to interpret the mind and the attitude of the 
more forward-looking business and industrial leaders of this 
country in relation to the social and industrial unrest and 
the pervasive spirit of change that marks our time. I have 
tried to catch their spirit rather than quote their words."

WHAT IS 
AMERICA? 

By EDWARD ALSWORTH ROSS 

Author of "Russia in Upheaval," "Changing America,' etc.; 
Professor of Sociology in The University of Wisconsin. 

" Our society is developing as the fathers neither 
foresaw nor intended. ... In the course of this de- 
velopment strain is produced on a large scale. You 
cannot lay it to persons, it is simply a by-product of 
social evolution. Of course we should seek out a 
remedy, but, in the meantime, we need not begin to 
quarrel among ourselves and hate one another. 

"The bulk of Americans well understand this. There are 
some who will do nothing about the suffering in the wake 
of social evolution lest their profits be disturbed. There 
are others who hold certain individuals responsible for this 
suffering and would wreck society in order to get at them. 
Between these are the steady-going millions who, without 
losing their tempers, seqk patiently for remedies. They have 
contended with a long series of grave problems, yet have 
not turned bitter. They exhibit that ' firm adherence to 
justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue,' with- 
out which, according to the Virginia Bill of Rights -of 1776, 
' no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be 
preserved to any people.' 

" It is to vindicate and commend this ' virtuous democ- 
racy ' that I offer this little book." From the author's

discovered, temporarily swings prices in that dis- 
trict in the other direction; that is, to the gold side 
of the ratio. 

In method, Professor Laughlin establishes his 
position by broad induction. His argument is based 
on an examination of economic conditions during the 
tremendous increase in the world's supply of gold 
between 1850 and 1873, and the gradual decline in 
prices which folowed from 1873 to 1896. Accord- 
ing to the quantitative theory, says the author, had 
prices kept pace with the increase in the world's 
gold supply between 1850 and 1873, and had the 
theory been sound, there would have been no panic, 
but an increased price level with a generally healthy 
business condition throughout the world. But while 
prices did increase (shown by excellent charts), the 
causes were found to reside in the expansion of trade, 
various European wars, and the growing importance 
of American agricultural efforts on world trade. 
For gold alone to be responsible for an upward trend 
in prices, the annual product must be large in pro- 
portion to the existing supply, while other conditions 
remain practically unchanged. But as inventions, 
tariffs, taxes, changes in the cost of raw materials, 
and higher wages are moving factors in the price 
question, gold as a commodity, alone, never has been 
a weighty enough explanation for the general move- 
ment of prices. An analogy taken from conditions 
which the present war generated further illustrates 
Prof. Laughlin's position. While prices have risen 
100 per cent or more in both Great Britain and in 
America, Great Britain has exported millions of 
pounds sterling to America. If the quantitative 
theory were sound, prices would have declined in 
Great Britain. And the reason for their stability 
and uniformity with prices in America is that busi- 
ness is conducted on a credit basis, and is not de- 
pendent on the comparatively insignificant move- 
ment of gold. 



BANNERS. 
Doran. 



By Babette Deutsch. 104 pages. 



There are so many of the younger poets whose 
chief delight it is to tramp in the mud of realism 
and then leave a gritty trail across the emotions 
that it is with something approaching a sense of re- 
lief that one turns to the author of Banners. Miss 
Deutsch's muse is close enough to earth for a touch 
of common humanity, but she does not mire her 
sandals in all the puddles. As a consequence there 
is a fresh vigor in her imagery, and a quickness of 
vision which carries her past some of the pitfalls 
of expression. What one finds lacking however in 
many of these poems is an appreciation of the posi- 
tive values of repression. Miss Deutsch embroiders 
too heavily upon her pattern, thrusting in new fig- 
ures, until the fabric is hidden in the profusion. 
By succumbing to this occasional temptation to 
overelaborate she lessens the dramatic effects which 
are the fruits of determined pruning. Her poems 
reveal a subtle sense of the contrasts which lie in 



crowds, and the contradictions between the fevers 
of modern life and the verities of nature. Pessimism 
is in the roots cf many of them, but pessimism with- 
out bitterness. Their philosophy is significantly 
mirrored by the recurrence of the adjective " alien " 
to designate those who have died. 

LETTERS FROM A FRENCH SOLDIER TO HIS 
MOTHER. Translated from the French of Let- 
tres d'un ^oldat by H. R. P. 67 pages. Alex- 
ander Moring; London. 

It is seldom enough that war or peace produces 
art so exquisite as that of the simple soldat Fran- 
cois whose letters fill this little book. Sharing in 
the vast suicidal courage of armies marching to a 
required sacrifice, this soldier had also a rarer and 
more individual quality. The war condemned him, 
an artist, " to gather flowers in the mud," and yet 
permitted him to write on the eve of his last bat- 
tle, " Come what will, we shall have known 
beauty." For him a landscape was " a cameo set in 
mists lighted by the moon " albeit the fields hid 
here and there " a corpse, white and magnificent." 
In the trenches he watched the scampering field- 
mice " pretty as a Japanese print, their ears pink 
as shells," or looked out upon " a sky in fury, all 
rose-colored and charming, sweeping across a 
phantom wood; the trees, luminously blue beneath, 
brown lacework above, the earth white. . . ." 
Finally in the presence of beauty and horror he 
could say, " For myself, I have no longer any de- 
sires. When the ordeal is past endurance, I am 
content to be merely unhappy." In filial devotion 
and in art's Ivory Tower he had found that last 
" degree of acquiescence which surpasses human 
courage." 

PAPA'S WAR AND OTHER SATIRES. By 
- Edward Garnett. 120 pages. Allen & Unwin. 

In these satires one is struck particularly by the 
absence of the detachment and grim humor that 
are usually to be found in this form of writing. 
The author is obsessed by his subject, which is so 
vital and serious that he can hardly get far enough 
away from it for even a wry smile. The articles 
appeared in various British periodicals during the 
War, and reflect radical opinion in England on 
certain phases of the great conflict. The initia- 
tion and conduct of the War, the treatment of 
pacifists, the manipulation of the press, the defec- 
tion of the liberal party, false idealism, religious 
hypocrisy, narrow patriotism, and all the reac- 
tionary tendencies that manifested themselves dur- 
ing that time are attacked with a freedom and 
vigor that would hardly have passed the censor in 
this country. The most noteworthy sketches in 
the volume are Papa's War, which gives its name 
to the collection, and Truth's Welcome Home, in 
both of which the part that the Virtues have had 
in bringing about and prolonging the War is 
emphasized.

THE RISING OF THE TIDE. By Ida M. 
Tarbell. 277 pages. Macmillan. 

Anyone who read the magazines of a dozen years 
ago remembers the muckrakers, that gallant lot of 
crusaders who acted on the assumption that America 
was Holy Land and Big Business the infidel in 
possession thereof, but who today seem as far off 
and abortive as the Jacquerie. Among that cour- 
ageous but rather priggish set, Ida M. Tarbell was 
one of the foremost exposers of iniquities. It is in- 
teresting to discover, therefore, that she has experi- 
enced a change of heart. Ralph Gardner, the young 
editor of this novel, is a muckrake wielder who 
might well have been one of her companions of 
other days; Reuben Cowder is a representative of 
secret and iniquitous forces. Yet almost the whole 
volume is devoted to proving Ralph wrong and the 
wealthy malefactor right. The acid test by which 
Cowder is shown to be the better man is that of pa- 
triotism; not that Ralph Gardner turns Bolshevik, 
but rather that his -opponent by manufacturing 
munitions aids the Allies even before we enter the 
war. 

The purpose of the novel is ostensibly to show 
the reactions of a small American community to the 
war spirit. What it really proves is that Miss Tar- 
bell, during her years of literary composition, has 
not neglected her reading. Indeed, all her char- 
acters have come out of the current periodicals. The 
Reverend Dick Ingraham, her hero, who stalks from 
page to page preaching the good in all bad people 
especially if they are prosperous munition makers 
does not so much mouth platitudes as live them; he 
is the embodiment of an editorial in the Times. 
Otto Littman, villain, is a cartoon in Life; Miss 
Patsy McCullon, the heroine of a Ladies' Home 
Journal story; Nancy Cowder, the picture of a fine 
lady out of Harper's Bazaar. And when at last she 
discovers her love for the Reverend Dick, when 
after an hour they come out of the house " with a 
look of glory on their faces," one strains a little to 
sniff the printer's ink which is their life blood, and 
to catch the faint rustle of paper. 

IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ST. PAUL. By Francis 
E. Clark. 434 pages. Putnam. 

The patriarch of Christian Endeavordom has 
written a pleasantly informal study of the first 
Christian missionary through the eyes of a traveler 
standing on the sites of cities his hero once visited. 
If only the traveler did not have to rhapsodize inter- 
minably over every spot " where St. Paul's feet may 
have trod." Dr. Clark's incidental discussion of 
contemporary characters, events, and movements in 
Antioch, Athens, Corinth, and so on fits Paul into 
the framework of the Graeco-Roman world of his 
time and gives him a background that most popular 
studies of St. Paul omit. The author is not always 
an informed traveler: for instance, he refers to 



several villages in Palestine as " Turkish villages." 
He has a passion for elucidating the obvious: he 
repeats more than once that Paul never saw the 
minarets on the Mosques of present-day Mohamme- 
danism. He has too a penchant for pious persiflage, 
as witness his preaching about the Isthmian games: 
" Let us hope and pray that the decadence and final 
destruction, which was undoubtedly hastened for 
Greece and Rome by the undue absorption of the 
people in mere sport, may not for the same reason 
overtake America and England." So he twaddles 
while the world suffers from a shortage of paper. 



THE PALISER CASE. .By Edgar Saltus. 315 
pages. Boni and Liveright. 

On the wrapper of this volume there is a super- 
fluous statement: ," This is not the great American 
novel." Between the covers there are many other 
superfluities characters and situations that exhibit 
the author's familiarity with metropolitan clubs 
and salons but do little to promote the progress of 
his story. One gets the impression that in Mr. 
Saltus' circle it is the thing to play polo and extend 
week-ends until they overlap. However, it must be 
set down to the credit of this novel that its most 
suggestive situation lacks in thrills all that it lacks 
in reality and that is a good deal. A study of the 
highly developed technique of bedroom comedy will 
enable Mr. Saltus to produce a novel that is posi- 
tively offensive. This one is merely shallow and 
annoyingly clever.

Books of the Fortnight 

Russia in 1919, by Arthur Ransome (232 pages; Huebsch), 
demonstrates the possibility of discussing the Rus- 
sian Revolution without resorting to verbal gesticula- 
tion. When Mr. Ransome discourses of his even- 
tenored journey into Russia and out again, he is at 
once matter-of-fact and quietly humorous. When the 
life of the country is his theme, his character studies 
are crisp and deftly drawn and his record of events 
has in it the material that makes history. Review 
later. 

Commercial Policy in Wartime and After, by William 
Smith Culbertson (479 pages; Appleton), is a study 
of the application of democratic ideas to international 
commercial relations. The author is a, member of the 
United States Tariff Commission. Review later. 

Greater European Governments, by A. Lawrence Lowell 
(329 pages; Harvard University Press), is an abridg- 
ment, brought up to date, of the two classic works on 
the Government of England and on the Governments 
and Parties in Continental Europe. The countries in- 
cluded are England, France, Italy, Germany, and 
Austria-Hungary. 

Self-Government in the Philippines, by Maximo M. Ka- 
law (210 pages; Century), bears internal evidence 
of the fitness of the Filipinos to exercise their proper 
political functions. The author, who is chief of the 
Department of Political Science in the University of 
the Philippines, presents a summary of a development 
which can be only equaled in rapidity by that of the 
Japanese. Review later. 

Bolshevism and the United States, by Charles Edward 
Russell (341 pages; Bobbs Merrill), adds the author's 
own testimony on the subject to the cloud of witnesses 
which he cites for support. The book does not en- 
lighten the reader however as to whether the cloud 
consists of angels or buzzards. Review later. 

America's Tomorrow, by Snell Smith (385 pages; Britton, 
New York), may be used as a criterion of Major 
General Leonard Wood's mental capacities. He says 
" it shows an immense amount of hard thinking." 
Cerebration of a sort may be found in this " his- 
toric, prophetic, and anthroponomic treatise," but the 
quality of the thinking is soft to the point of mushi-* 
ness. General Wood's judgment was- corrupted by 
the fact that the author thinks the I. W. W., an almost 
extinct organization, is a greater menace to liberty 
than the National Security League, a very active and 
powerful one. , 

The Covenanter, by William H. Taft, George W. Wick- 
ersham, A. Lawrence Lowell, and Henry W. Taft 
(188 pages; Doubleday, Page), brings together a 
series of papers which first appeared in the daily 
press. They are modeled after The Federalist, and 
deal point by point with objections to the Covenant. 

Scenes from Italy's War, by G. M. Trevelyan (240 pages; 
Houghton Mifflin), is an historical narrative rather 
than a collection of personal reminiscences, although 
material of the latter sort is frequently made service- 
able to the history. Breadth of scope and dignity of 
style give Mr. Trevelyan's volume a place of distinc- 
tion among the war books of the day. Review later. 

Canada at War, by J. Castell Hopkins (448 pages; 
Doran), is a "record of heroism and achievement" 
from 1914 to 1918. The text is replete with names 
and statistics, not very well digested. 



The Religion of Old Glory, by William Norman Guthrie 
(414 pages; Doran), expounds the creed of a clerical 
Ferrovius who has turned from the Christian God of 
the Church Universal to worship the martial deity 
of local nationalism. A mystical, symbolical, fetich- 
istic, nonsensical attempt to inculcate fiagolatry in a 
populace that needs no such special encouragement to 
join in the war dances of the National Security 
League's great religious cult. 

The Sword of Deborah, by F. Tennyson Jesse (126 
pages; Doran), contains first-hand impressions, by a 
distinguished romancer of the variously initialed 
divisions of the British Women's army in France. A 
belated bit of propaganda, as the author is frank 
enough to say, with a flavor now and again that re- 
calls the age of Tennyson, rather than that of Jesse. 

The Story of the Rainbow Division, by Raymond S. 
Tompkins (264 pages; Boni & Liveright), presents a 
war narrative stamped with the official approval of 
the Commanding General of the Division, and illu- 
minated with a more than official enthusiasm for the 
achievements of the first National Guard unit to join 
the A. E. F. 

Animism, by George William Gilmore (241 pages; 
Marshall Jones), presents a study of the primitive 
origin of religious beliefs. Man, the author believes, 
has always been essentially " theotropic, though he 
was not always conscious of the direction of his trop- 
ism." Review later. 

Experiments in Psychical Science, by W. J. Crawford 
(201 pages; Dutton), is a detailed examination of 
physical phenomena of spiritualism, as demonstrated 
in the Goligher circle at Belfast. The author is a 
doctor of science, and his report of a series of forty- 
one experiments has at least the formal technique of a 
scientific investigation. 

The Book of the Cave, by Sir Ananda Acharya (148 
pages; Macmillan), is speculative philosophy in son- 
orous prose, cast in a mold of ritualistic dialogue, and 
shedding somewhat Dantean illumination upon Brah- 
manic paths. It adds one more to the expanding 
bookshelf of the Hindu mystics. 

Theology as an Empirical Science, by Douglas Clyde 
Macintosh (270 pages; Macmillan), is an attempt to 
pour the proverbial old wine of theocentric religion 
through the funnel of metaphysics into the new bot- 
tles of science. 

Leaves in the Wind, by "Alpha of the Plough" (274 
pages; Dutton), is another collection of thumb-nail 
essays by the author of Pebbles on the Shore, which 
Henry Fuller reviewed in THE DIAL for June 6, 1918. 
They are genial, varied in theme, and follow for the 
most part familiar grooves. Clive Gardiner supple- 
ments the text with numerous illustrations. Review 
later. 

Golden Days, by Romilly Fedden (233 pages; Houghton 
Mifflin), comprises reminiscent sketches from the fish- 
ing log of a painter in Brittany. The author is an 
ardent fly-fisherman, and his pages will echo respon- 
sively among fellow devotees of the rod. He has, in 
his own phrase, turned back the pages of his fishing 
log and re-lived the past. The descriptive flights are 
prone to be flowery; the author is more at ease as he 
discourses of avocational technique.

THE DIAL 



August 9 



The Men Who Make Our Novels, by George Gordon 
(262 pages; Moffat,. Yard), is a labyrinth of bio- 
graphical disorder, top-heavy with quotations, and 
held together upon the precarious thread of the com- 
piler's self-assurance. The ground work of the vari- 
ous chapters, each dealing with a separate novelist, is 
usually the solicited autobiography of the writer in- 
volved. If this proved adequate, it is thrown upon 
the canvas with slight embellishment; but in cases 
where the response has not fulfilled expectations, Mr. 
Gordon has caught up a handful of quotation marks, 
a quart measure of parentheses, and gone manfully 
to his task. 



Judith: A Play, by Arnold Bennett (96 pages; Doran), 
tells again the apocryphal story of Judith, lady mur- 
deress of Judea, who seduces the Assyrian chieftain 
besieging her native city, cuts off his head, and brings 
it triumphantly home in a sack.' The dry humor of 
Mr. Bennett's lines gains by incongruity. Review 
later. 



Abraham Lincoln: A Play, by John Drinkwater (112 
pages; Houghton Mifflin), has in it certain little an- 
glicisms that will fall queerly upon American ears, 
and the scenes are interspersed with Greek recitatives 
that seem strangely out of place among America's 
plain people. But incongruities are forgotten in the 
final masterly restraint of this picture of triumph and 
of tragedy. Review later. 

Stuff and Nonsense: A Book of War Verses, by Ian 
Malcolm (196 pages; Hodder and Stoughton), reveals, 
through its off-duty activities, the quality of a safe 
British mind. The author is an M. P. and was one of 
Mr. Balfour's Mission to the United States. His hu- 
morous reactions to the Pope's appeal and the replies 
it drew, to Karl's notes, to the Armistice, the Peace 
Conference, and the Prinkipo proposal, as to air-raids 
and submarine warfare, are the reflexes of a mind 
conventional, insular, unremittingly partisan senti- 
mental over every Saxon virtue, cynical toward every 
foreign virtue and novel hope. The verses dealing 
with the Mission, from Mr. Balfour's mal de mer to 
the circular injunction on deportment and silence, 
will be of first interest to Americans; obviously 
dashed off for the " missionaries," they are something 
of a give-away. Mr. Malcolm's lines are deft enough 
to read easily; most of its jokes are italicized. 

The Taker, by Daniel Carson Goodman (248 pages; Boni 
& Liveright), is another novel from the author of 
Hagar Revelly. In his intimate exposition of the life 
of his hero Mr. Goodman has not neglected his other 
characters; the result is an honest, full-bodied, some- 
times memorable representation of a sector of the con- 
temporary American scene. A study in frustration 
that suffers a little for lack of a maturer economy 
of means. Review later. 

Saul: A Novel of Jewish Life, by Corinne Lowe (347 
pages; McCann), is, for the most part, a portrayal of 
the industrial life of the Jewish garment-maker. Life 
outside the shop is given but scant attention. Yet in 
Saul Furinski Miss Lowe has caught, behind the 
shrewd struggle for financial success, a groping love 
of beauty. Review later. 

The Sword, by G. O. Warren (152 pages; Longmans, 
Green), is a substantial collection of short poems, oc- 
casionally marked by freshness of treatment, though 
rarely by novelty of theme. Otherwise the author 



would have banished death more rigorously, and not 
permitted its intrusion on so many pages. The verses 
reveal an adequate sense of rhythm and that lean 
vigor which comes from economy of images. 

From Father to Son, by Mary S. Watts (310 pages; Mae- 
millan), is a well-written but inconclusive story of 
the conflict of business ideals. It has excellent char- 
acterization and workmanship but the note of convic- 
tion is lacking and this impairs the reader's interest. 

The Blooming Angel, by Wallace Irwin (285 pages; 
Doran), applied the familiar get-rich-quick formula 
to the familiar get-into-the-Saturday-Evening-Post- 
quick sort of fiction. The heroine is breezy, vivacious, 
and a delightful money-maker. Mr. Irwin presents 
one more variation of the favorite fairy story of the 
American reading public. 

Far-Away Stories, by William J. Locke (265 pages; 
Lane), were written, with one or two exceptions, in 
pre-war days and have just been collected by an 
author who declares himself unwilling to let them 
lie in " the vaults of dead-magazine numbers." Sweet 
Sixteen may welcome these tit-bits as a relief from 
Red Cross work and high-school examinations on the 
nature and origin of Bolshevism. 

Rebecca's Promise, by Frances R. Sterrett (330 pages; 
Appleton), makes its contribution to Pollyanna phil- 
osophy by propounding the original idea of memory 
insurance against the exigencies of old age for 
" memories are the only real fountain of youth." 

An Adopted Husband, by Futabatei, translated from the 
Japanese by Buhachiro Mitsui and Gregg M. Sin- 
clair (275 pages; Knopf), is done in a flat monotone 
reminiscent of the Russians. When the complicated 
relationships of illegitimate-daughter-and-all-endur- 
ing-son-adopted-to-marry - legitimate - daughter - and- 
preserve-honorable-family-name are once understood ; 
little of interest remains. - 

The Groper, by Henry G. Aikman (282 pages; Boni & 
Liveright), is a first novel that offers very little to 
the numerous gropers who will be intrigued by its 
title: it throws only a jaundiced light on their prob- 
lems and lacks the realism to support their habit of 
self-identification. 

The Trail of the Beast, by Achmed Abdullah (343 pages; 
McCann), is one more reverberation of the spy plot 
heard 'round the world, which re-enforces its bid for 
popularity by putting its adroit American detective 
in Parisian setting. The story is brisky told, and the 
colors are laid on with more skill than sincerity. 

One of Three, by Clifford Raymond (285 pages; Doran), 
is a mystery story by the editorial writer on the 
Chicago Tribune, whose somewhat mysterious edi- 
torial was responsible for the Ford suit. 

Off Duty: A Dozen Yarns for Soldiers and Sailors (337 
pages; Century), collects a group of stories that will 
appeal to a wider audience than that named in the 
sub-title unless O. Henry, Bret Harte, W. D. How- 
ells, and the rest have lost their hold on America. 

The Land of Tomorrow, by William B. Stevenson (240 
pages; Doran), is devoted to a description of the won- 
ders of Alaska. The book has not enough intimacy 
with man or nature to save it from that least desired 
of qualities mediocrity.

DO YOU READ FOR YOUR LIVING? 

THE NEW AGE 

SAYS APROPOS OF THE DIAL 



" A world of readers connotes large 
numbers, consisting chiefly of readers in 
search of amusement; but the world of 
readers consists of the few in every coun- 
try who really read for their living, or 
rather, for their lives. To appeal to the 
latter class is to be ' of the centre,' for the 
centre of every movement of life is not 
only the most vital, it is the smallest ele- 
ment of the whole . . . the most re- 
cent American journals appear to be en- 
deavoring to become organs for this class 
of reader. Among tne most encouraging 
of them is The Dial, a fortnightly review 
and topical miscellany published in New 
York. Since the war, The Dial has ex- 
panded considerably and of set purpose; 
and it is now one of the best of such peri- 
odicals in any part of the world, France and 
England not excepted" 



If you wish to be identified with this " vital central life " you will find 
that The Dial is essential. You may take advantage of our special sum- 
mer introductory offer," made only to new subscribers : A six months'

X"JLMERICAN LABOR is thirty years behind the 
British labor movement." Is there an English labor 
leader who has failed in the last ten years to make 
this cheerful observation? The presumption is 
that there is only one conceivable method of pro- 
gression: the British. But, if the proposition of 
the Brotherhood workers now before the country 
should go through it is conceivable that another 
method distinctly American will be presented the 
world. It will not be a class conscious method, 
to be sure ; it will not be concerned with rights but 
with opportunity for increased accomplishment. 
While the rest of the world for the large part, 
thanks to Russia, seems to have reached in revolu- 
tionary suggestion the point of saturation, we have 
remained characteristically immune. If the proposi- 
tion of the Brotherhoods is endorsed it will not be 
because a new social, revolutionary consciousness 
has been evoked but because the scheme of finance 
supporting the old order is so obviously failing to 
float industrial enterprise; it will mean an assump- 
tion of new responsibility because of the irresponsi- 
bility of the old directorate and institution. 

The Plumb Plan, as the proposal is called, is 
the only suggestion before the country which recog- 
nizes that further dependence on the present scheme 
of credit means industrial suicide; it is the only 
proposition that attempts to take hold of the 
transportation problem and solve it in the interest 
of transportation service. But the Plan is also a 
matter of special concern and lively interest because 
it reflects the sort of a labor program that appeals 
to the common run of people in the United States; 
it does not deal in theory; it is not concerned with 
class distinctions or interests or rights; it requires 
little imagination or reasoning to grasp its value. 
In short, it is not a labor but an industrial program. 
It is a hard-headed scheme for running the rail- 
roads of the country on a basis of efficiency; more- 
over it is a direct outgrowth of "our corporate ex- 
perience and in the matter of labor control and 
centralized power follows precedent with sufficient 
familiarity to forestall any serious charge of Bol- 
shevik taint. 



To restate briefly the Plan it is already well 
advertised I quote from Mr. Plumb's statement 
before the Interstate Commerce Committee. He 
told the Committee that the Plan proposed was an 
operating corporation where operating ability con- 
stituted the sole capital. He said: 

We would recognize as operating ability the skill, induS" 
try, and application of every employee, from president 
down to office boy. . . . Such a corporation requires 
no capital. It should be organized under a federal law. 
It should be authorized to take and hold and operate those 
properties under the full regulatory power of the gov- 
ernment, to whom it should account for all its operations 
and expenditures. It should be required to meet all costs 
of operation and fixed charges upon the capital employed 
which had been guaranteed by the government. A certain 
agreed percentage of the net results of operation should 
belong to this corporation. The stock of this corporation 
should be held in trust for the benefit of the employees. 
The earnings of the corporation should constitute a trust 
fund to be declared as a dividend upon the amounts paid 
to the labor which it employs, every employee receiving 
that proportion of this trust fund which his annual wage 
bore to the total annual compensation of all employees. 
The affairs of this corporation should be administered by 
a Board of Directors which we suggest, merely tentatively, 
should be selected in the following manner one-third of 
the directors to be elected by the classified employees belo^v 
th grade of appointed officials; one-third by the appointed 
officers and employees; the final third being appointed by 
the President of the United States. This Board of Directors 
should have the power to appoint all officers from the 
President down to the point where employment begins by 
classification and to prescribe the conditions of employ- 
ment and classification of all other employees. . . . 
We would suggest [Mr. Plumb continued] that a wage 
board and boards of adjustment analogous to the present 
boards existing under the Director General of Railways 
should be organized. 

The plan provides for an automatic reduction 
in rates ; Mr. Plumb illustrates the operation as 
follows : 

If the minimum rates so fixed would produce an operat- 
ing revenue more than sufficient to meet the requirements 
of the service, we would suggest a method for providing 
for an automatic reduction in rates that would absorb the 
surplus. This can best be illustrated by way of example: 
assuming that the capital invested amounted to $18,000,- 
000,000 approximately the amount of the book entry 
called "property investment account" if the fixed 
charges on this amount were four per cent per annum it 
would be $720,000,000. Assuming that the gross operating 
revenue were $4,000,000,000 and the ratio of operating ex- 
pense to gross operating revenue was seventy per cent, the 
net operating revenue would be $1,200,000,000. Subtract 



132 



THE DIAL

from this the fixed charges of $720,000,000, you would have 
remaining $500,000,000, which should be divided between 
the Government and the corporation half-and-half, labor 
receiving $250,000,000 for a dividend on the pay roll, the 
Government receiving $250,000,000 as its share of the net 
revenue. The Government's share, $250,000,000, would be 
in excess of five per cent of the gross operating revenue. 
You could provide that whenever the total amount of net 
revenue paid to the Government exceded five per cent of 
the gross operating revenue, the Interstate Commerce 
Commission should thereupon adjust the scale of rates in 
such manner as to absorb this . . . , thereby pro- 
ducing a ... reduction in rates. 

The proposal of the Brotherhoods is the only 
reconstruction scheme which has been presented to 
the country that does not sentimentalize over a 
system of credit which is passing through its first 
stages of senility. Mr. Plumb reminded the mem- 
bers of the Interstate Commerce Committee that 
the carriers are asking that Committee to frame 
legislation whereby the police power of the Govern- 
ment shall be exercised not to protect the public 
from extortion but to protect those private interests 
from the effect of their own competition by assisting 
them in charging exorbitant rates. " It is a con- 
fession, an open confession," he remarked, " that the 
competitive system no longer exists." Appearing 
again before the Committee, on August 8, Mr. 
Plumb said that during the week the Brotherhoods 
and the A. F. of L. had come into possession of 
evidence which proved that "leading directly from 
Wall Street, from the banking houses controlled 
by the Morgan and Rockefeller groups, there was 
proceeding a systematized plundering of virtually 
all the public transportation highways pf the United 
States, such as looted and wrecked the N. Y., N. 
H. & H., the Rock Island, the Chicago, Alton, 
and the Frisco lines. . . . The interests are 
again gathering their forces of private and secret 
control and seek, after having gained from Con- 
gress a sanction to rehabilitate their railroad 
properties at public expense, to begin again and 
follow through its corrupt and wicked cycle the 
systematized plundering and looting of the public 
and public interest in the nation's highways." 

As opposed to the policy of loot, the Plumb 
scheme on its fiscal side is revolutionary. More- 
over it reserves the dividends which result from 
an economy of administration for the force of 
workers who actually participated in effecting the 
economy, instead of distributing them as hereto- 
fore among the* private owners who created 
nothing. It is revolutionary of course to award 
credit on the basis of ability to produce. The Plan 
is revolutionary because it commits the intolerable 
heresy of separating ownership and administrative 



control. It jumps the whole period of state capital- 
ism and state socialism and in the process robs a 
legion of office holders of the chance to batten on 
transportation at public expense. No wonder the 
hearing before the House on August 7 created a 
panic. State Socialism would have been infinitely 
preferable as it would have proved at least a heaven' 
for the functionaries. 

From the point of view of public service the 
Plan transcends all others which have been ad- 
vanced; but there are two points, inherent in the 
old scheme of operation, which the proposed scheme 
fails to correct. One is, that where an economy in 
transportation, such as short hauls in place of long 
ones, would result 'in the curtailment of the volume 
of business, no assurance is given that the Board 
of Directors under the Plan would endorse a policy 
of curtailment. This objection to the Plan as it is 
presented could be met if it were specifically pro- 
vided that representatives of the Interstate Com- 
merce Commission or some other Federal agency 
especially created for the purpose were employed by 
the government to check up and develop an economy 
in the routing of freight. The second point of 
objection is the organization of the operating cor- 
poration. The point of pivotal significance in the 
Plan is that ability is the corporation's asset, and yet 
in stating the scheme of organization it is not made 
clear how the organization will be managed so as 
to release ability. The Plan, like private operation, 
depends for the workers' interest and responsibility 
on hope of financial reward. It makes no specific 
suggestion for attaining the interest and responsi- 
bility which follows participation in the solution 
of technical problems. There is no indication that 
the promoters of the Plan are not laboring under 
the old obsession that a citizen or a member of an- 
organization is efficient if he casts a vote once in so 
often or if he is given a rake-off in the shape of 
profits once or twice during the year. It may be 
that those behind the Plan recognize that repre- 
sentative government and profit sharing have no 
relation whatever to responsibility; that these insti- 
tutions are powerless to release ability. They may 
know that if the classified employees are to depend 
upon representatives for the development of ad- 
ministrative policies they will be as powerless as 
they are now as citizens to change state policy in 
matters, say, of housing or cost of food. If they 
realize this, as they must if they understand the 
technique of releasing ability, then they should 
make it clear that the success of organization is de- 
pendent for administrative measures upon an in- 



igig

tensive participation of the workers in the develop- 
ment of enterprise in every section of railroad oper- 
ation ; and that the business of the Board of 
Directors is to respond to and coordinate a decen- 
tralized organization of management. In giving 
the Plan support it is important to know whether 
or not the promoters appreciate the significance of 
decentralized administrative schemes such as the 
shop stewards of England propose. 

It is particularly incumbent on the promoters 
to make this clear, since the honorary Vice-Presi- 
dent of their League the President of the A. F. 
of L. has given his best energies to the develop- 
ment of centralized control. Indeed no corporation 
in the country can offer Mr. Gompers instruction 
along these lines. Moreover the reactionary press 
is looking to Mr. Gompers to save the situation. 
Pained and perplexed, The New York Times asks 
"Where does Mr. Gompers stand?" 

Has he deserted us; that valiant patriot, hater 
of all things socialistic, brave spokesman for the 
old order of business-like business? Where does 
he stand? Does it matter? It is two months since 
the Convention of the A. F. of L. was held and 
Mr. Gompers was reelected president without op- 
position, his salary was increased and every 
administrative policy which he and his machine 
advocated was endorsed. But during the session of 
the convention, in the midst of official triumph, 
he was tested. The representatives of one hundred 
and fifty thousand Brotherhood men, simon-pure 
trade unionists of anti-socialist reputation, laid be- 
fore the Federation their scheme of credit and rail- 
road administration. It was not stated that the 
scheme if successful would overturn the whole sys- 
tem of business finance, but all the details of the 
plan were presented. The measure was reported 
favorably to the Executive Council for action, 
without a doubt in the mind of any one that it 
would go through. Why? Not because the officers 
wanted it; not at all. The scheme offered was 
presented by officials, who from the trade union 
point of view had done the most complete job in 
labor organization that had ever been accomplished, 
who were as well received in the business world as 
Mr. Gompers, and who had been successful as 
Mr. Gompers could never hope to be with the 
nation's lawmakers. Moreover the scheme repre- 
sented the triumph of trade unionism. What the 
Brotherhoods offered the Federation was a new 
band wagon; they could get on or stay off. The 
wagon looked painfully new but it also looked good 
and strong. They got on. If we may judge from 
Mr. Morrison's testimony before the House Com- 



mittee in support of the Plan they are uncomfort- 
able; they are hardly yet at home. They may even 
in their discomfort fall off, but if they do? The 
new machine which drew up before the convention 
was equipped with twelve cylinder engines, while 
the Federation's was dependent upon a couple of 
old war-horses whose best -days were past. 

The war has strained business enterprise, on 
which the A. F. of L. has banked for its sustenance 
and life, to the breaking point. Neither the govern- 
ment nor the financiers can seriously affect the 
dizzy chase of wages after prices and prices after 
costs. Anarchy reigns; the pivotal point of the 
old order is lost. "Unauthorized" strikes are 
labor's subconscious reaction to that fact. In these 
strikes labor is feeling out for a new synthesis, not 
a class conscious one but an industrial order where 
wages and costs bear some relation to each other. 
The old machine of the Federation has no con- 
tribution to make along these lines. The Plan 
of the Brotherhoods gives a significant lead. Not, 
if you please, a class conscious one, but a clear cut 
business proposition. There is no idealism in the 
conception offered ; there is no theory even of in- 
dustrial democracy; but the Plan is exciting, and 
plainly a better case can be made out of it for 
presentation to the American public than any cor- 
poration privately financed and conducted in secret 
has yet been able to put up. 

The banks before making industrial loans these 
days not only examine into financial credit 
and ability to make payments but also look into 
the record of the applicant firm or corporation: 
.that is, into its success in so treating its men 
as to avoid strikes. If this is the settled policy of 
the banking houses, and the strike epidemic con- 
tinues at its present rate, how many corporations 
will there be in existence that will come up to 
the requirements of the financiers, and on what basis 
of credit can loans be made in the future except 
on the ability of the producers themselves, as the 
Brotherhoods suggest, to deliver goods? 

While the Plan is not consciously concerned with 
rights or ideals, it is based on the high coordinat- 
ing factor in life the principle of giving. It stands 
in direct opposition to the egoism of modern enter- 
prise, which accepts the primitive idea of accom- 
plishment and the satisfaction of individual desires 
as the reason for existence. While it is untouched 
by the proletarian aspirations of Europe, the 
Brotherhoods' scheme of industrial reorganization 
owes its life to the coordinating principle that has 
inspired the European renascence.

Canada's One Big Union 



A HE CLOSE of the first convention of the One 
Big Union at Calgary in June marked the begin- 
ning of a new labor movement in Canada. The 
Winnipeg general strike, in spite of the conspiracy 
of silence on the part of the press bureaus of Amer- 
ica has forced some news of the new movement to 
filter through to the United States and close 
students of labor affairs are paying increasing atten- 
tion to Canadian developments. So meagre have 
been the facts reported in the press however that 
it is difficult for any except those who have been 
on the ground to appreciate the full significance 
of the situation in the Dominion. Had I been here, 
reading reports of the Winnipeg strike in news- 
papers which denounced it as a Bolshevist Revolu- 
tion and an attempt to set up a Soviet Government, 
I would perhaps have been startled and found it 
difficult to account for the fact that a country which 
had long been noted for its conservative labor move- 
ment could suddenly reveal such a spirit on the 
part of organized labor. 

Even though I was in the midst o'f the movement 
in Western Canada, watching it at close range, the 
speed with which it spread across the Dominion to 
the Eastern provinces surprised me. In September 
and October I was in Ontario and though the move- 
ment was already being heard from in the West, 
the radicals in the East looked upon the rank and 
file of the unions in Ontario as a hopelessly reac- 
tionary section of labor. Today in Toronto these 
unions are lining up by an overwhelming vote for 
the One Big Union after having demonstrated their 
advanced attitude by a general strike in sympathy 
with the Winnipeg strikers, a strike which affected 
two-thirds of the workers of Toronto and tied up 
the city for several days. In Montreal the Trades 
and Labor Council has voted endorsement of the 
One Big Union, completely reversing a position 
taken by it only a few weeks ago. In Cape Breton, 
returned soldiers and trade unionists have formed 
a Soldiers' and Workmen's Council in the most 
extensive coal and steel producing area of the 
Dominion, while in Nova Scotia the latest reports 
indicate that the workers everywhere will follow 
the rest of Canadian organized labor into the ranks 
of the One Big Union. 

Thus it is evident that the new labor movement 
in Canada is a revolutionary industrial union move- 
ment. Growing out of the A. F. of L., it has cap- 
tured the rank and file of the conservative craft 
unions and transformed their entire spirit. Real- 
izing the futility of trying to force from power the 



reactionary leadership of the Internationals, backed 
by the conservative membership south of the bound- 
ary, the Canadian workers have organized a 
Dominion-wide secession movement that has already 
launched a new organization and threatens to carry 
at least four-fifths of the membership of the Canad- 
ian unions out of the American Federation of Labor. 
With such overwhelming majorities it seems certain 
that the minorities now voting against the O.B.U. 
will prefer to go on with the new union and thus 
leave the A. F. of L. completely without representa- 
tion in Canada with the possible exception of a 
handful of insignificant locals in trades that have 
no influence on the general industrial situation. 

Under these conditions it becomes highly impor- 
tant to understand the foundations of the One Big 
Union movement. 

The Constitution adopted at its first convention 
provides for an all-embracing form of labor organ- 
ization after the pattern of the Industrial Workers 
of the World, the industrial subdivisions to be 
determined at the next convention. Its member- 
ship is open to all wage-workers and the maximum 
initiation fee is one dollar. Its General Executive 
Board will consist of a Chairman, Secretary, and 
representatives of the various industries. These 
officials are elected for six months only and their 
pay is $40 per week. Power remains in the hands 
of the rank and file, all officials being subject to 
recall at any time by a majority vote of the body 
electing them. Conventions will be held every six 
months, proportional representation governing the 
number of delegates. In the matter of strikes and 
disputes, final decision rests securely in the hands 
of the rank and file. 

While some features essential to a revolutionary 
industrial union organization are not covered by the 
One Big Union constitution, such as a universal 
transfer card system which would permit workers 
to pass from local units of one industry to another 
without payment of initiation fees or loss of stand- 
ing, the constitution is broad and flexible enough 
to permit the easy perfection of all details in subse- 
quent conventions. 

The fundamental spirit of the movement is 
summed up in the final clause which reads: 

Whenever a strike in any district or industry takes 

place, no member of the One Big Union shall handle 

directly or indirectly any products of the industry on 
strike. 

" If they live up to that, they're all-right," said 
a revolutionary labor leader of international prom-

inence to me. If we need a promise that the Canad- 
ian workers will live up to it, I think we can find 
it in the strike movement recently centered around 
Winnipeg. That this radical spirit of solidarity 
animates the rank and file of the Canadian work- 
ingclass has been amply demonstrated by the 
extraordinary response to the calls for sympathetic 
strikes to aid the workers in the building and metal 
trades of Winnipeg. 

On the first of May these trades went on strike 
for a living wage. Although the One Big Union 
had not yet officially come into existence, the strike, 
was controlled by One Big Union tactics and the 
striking trades were all united through the Metal 
'Trades Council which proposed to represent them 
in dealing with the employers. The employers 
determined to make their fight at this point and 
refused to deal with the Metal Trades Council. 
So the strike came to a deadlock on this question 
and the big issue became the right of the workers 
to collective bargaining. 

On May 15 the Winnipeg Trades and Labor 
Council called a general strike 6f all the organized 
workers of the city, in sympathy with the metal 
and building trades. The response of the workers 
to this general strike call resulted in the most com- 
plete cessation of work ever experienced on this con- 
tinent. Winnipeg was dead. The normal life of 
the community ceased absolutely. No street cars 
moved. Teamsters, drivers, chauffeurs completed 
the tie-up of all vehicles. The shutting off of power 
stations stopped everything dependent upon elec- 
tricity. No light, no water running through the 
mains. Abattoirs and creameries closed, cutting 
down the food supply. Telephone, telegraph, and 
mail service stopped. Waiters, cooks, hotel em- 
ployees of all sorts joined the strike. Clerks and 
cleaners, scavengers and civil service employees, fire- 
men and policemen had been organized and walked 
out with the rest. 

For four days Winnipeg was helpless in the hands 
of Labor and Labor waited calmly with folded arms. 
Then the Strike Committee relieved the tension by 
issuing permits for several kinds of workers, to 
return to work. Enough men were allowed in the 
pumping station to keep water flowing in one and 
two story buildings. The workers do not live in 
skyscrapers in Winnipeg. Milk wagon drivers 
were allowed to deliver milk to hospitals. Enough 
firemen and policemen were allowed to return to 
meet an emergency. This demonstration of power 
merely maddened the employers. The press had 
been stopped by the strike of typographical workers 
and pressmen. A citizen's committee of 1,000 was 
formed to combat the Soviet of the strikers. They 



found volunteer printers and began to issue a four 
page daily paper called the Citizen. The strikers 
replied by changing the Western Labor News, their 
organ, from a weekly to a daily. 

The Citizen and the capitalist press elsewhere 
throughout the Dominion denounced the strike as 
an attempt to set up a Soviet government in Can- 
ada. The resumption of activities in Winnipeg to 
a sufficient extent so that no one should suffer any 
hardship and be deprived of the necessities of life 
was a concession of the strike committee of 300. 
This was intolerable to the citizen's committee who 
demanded to know by what right the strike com- 
mittee should dictate that food be distributed. The 
government stood quite helpless. The man-power 
in all its departments was out on strike. The 
officials fumed but could not function. The postal 
employees were officially dismissed. An ultimatum 
was issued to the police but they refused to return 
to work and were dismissed from the Chief down. 
Mr. Robertson, the Dominion Minister of Labor, 
came to investigate and declared the blame for the 
strike should rest upon the One Big Union. 

Mr. Robertson had previously encountered the 
new spirit of labor in Winnipeg about a year ago. 
On that occasion the city employees, postal clerks, 
and police struck for the right to organize in labor 
unions. When the city officials refused to grant 
this right the Trades and Labor Council began to 
call out other workers, one trade after another. 
When the strike threatened to reach the propor- 
tions of a general tie-up, Mr. Robertson arrived 
on the scene and ordered the city government to 
recognize the strikers right to organize. Now, 
however, the government employees were striking 
in sympathy with other trades. Mr. Robertson de- 
tected a difference and ordered the dismissal of the 
postal workers. The incident illustrates the atti- 
tude of the Canadian government in the face of its 
new problem of labor and the defiance of the gov- 
ernment employees demonstrates the impotency of 
this attitude. Directly out of the Winnipeg strike 
of a year ago the One Big Union movement may 
properly be said to have grown. The spirit of 
solidarity then manifested, in which the rank and 
file of the trade unions defied all edicts of Inter- 
national officers, broke contracts, and struck in 
sympathy with the city employees, heralded the 
beginning of the end of the A. F. of L. in Canada. 

During the past winter the advocates of indus- 
trial unionism within the Canadian Federation in 
the four Western provinces of Manitoba, Saskat- 
chewan, Alberta, and British Columbia organized 
for the propaganda of the one big union idea and 
secession from the A. F. of L. In April this move-

ment had advanced to the point where a referendum 
was being taken of all the Canadian unions except 
the railroad brotherhoods. When the Winnipeg 
strike began this referendum had already shown a 
vast majority of the workers in the four prov- 
inces to be in favor of the secession move. The 
referendum was completed during May and showed 
88 per cent of the organized workers in Western 
Canada in favor of the One Big Union. Its 
first convention was called to open on June 5 at 
Calgary. 

In the meantime the O. B. U. advocates had 
called for another referendum for a sympathetic 
strike and one after another the cities of Western 
Canada were tied up by strikes which in many 
instances reached the same proportions as that in 
Winnipeg. Simultaneously the movement had 
spread eastward, and in Toronto more than 15,000 
workers went out in sympathy with their Winnipeg 
brothers. All over the eastern section of the coun- 
try the referendum upon the question of secession 
has continued and everywhere the returns indicate 
the same large majorities for the One Big Union. 
To date no city or town in Canada has voted 
against the O. B. U. and I have heard of no local 
union in any important industry voting down the 
proposition. 

The Calgary Convention completely severed 
organized labor in the four Western provinces from 
the Federation and at the present rate of growth 
it seems but a matter of a few weeks when Ontario, 
Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces will have com- 
pletely joined the movement. The next conven- 
tion, which will take place in November, will bring 
about the formation of the industrial sub-divisions; 
and for the first time in history we will see the 
active labor groups of a whole nation completely 
organized upon industrial union lines. One reason 
for postponing the formation of the industrial sub- 
divisions undoubtedly is the hope of having the run- 
ning trades of the railroads to form the backbone 
of the transportation industry. 

Though the railroad workers in Canada as in 
the United States have been generally looked upon 
as one of the most conservative sections of the 
labor movement, their recent activities in the West 
reveal in a startling way the extent to which the 
one big union idea has spread among them. 

In Winnipeg during the last week of the gen- 
eral strike the railroad workers voted to join the 
sympathetic strike if the policemen were dismissed 
by the city and when the police were dismissed stood 
ready to tie up the railroads upon the call of the 
strike committee. For this action three locals were 
expelled by their Internationals and locals of rail- 
road workers were also expelled in Edmonton, Cal- 



gary, and Regina. Thus already the breach has 
been made in the running trades and its spread will 
inevitably mean the gathering of the railroad work- 
ers into the fold of the O. B. U. 

With practically every other type of overland 
transportation worker already organized the 
O. B. U. will have a firm grip upon this basic 
industry. The mining, metal, and building indus- 
* tries in Canada are perhaps the best organized trades 
in the Dominion, and they are strongest for the 
O. B. U. The wide extent of organization among 
civil* service employees and the strong industrial 
union spirit among them is a very important factor 
as the general strike situation proved. 

Though the Winnipeg strike was called off by 
the workers pending negotiation of the questions 
at issue in the building and metal trades dispute, 
the strike was not by x any means lost and as one of 
the leaders told me they will undoubtedly "come 
back stronger next time." 

An indication that their power is not lessening is 
shown by the action of the government in the case 
of the arrested strike leaders. These men were 
arrested during the last week of the strike and 
charged with " seditious conspiracy." They were 
held without bail and the government threatened 
to try them in camera and deport them. But the 
O. B. U. immediately issued a call for a 
Dominion-wide general strike and balloting began. 
The government promptly backed down and dur- 
ing the past week they were released on bonds, the 
highest bail being $4,000. 

The demand of the Citizen's Committee for the 
deportation of these inert was part of a general 
propaganda carried on against the strikers by stim- 
ulating the timeworn enmities against " foreigners 
and aliens." In Western Canada the native sons 
are the English, Irish, Scotch, and Americans who 
were the earlier pioneers of this comparatively re- 
cently settled country. While there are considerable 
numbers of other European peoples to be found in 
the mines, on the farms, and in many industries, I 
found that the native sons were the predominant 
element in the labor movement as elsewhere and 
the " anti-foreigner " campaign made little head- 
way against a labor organization, the leaders of 
which bear such distinctly " Canadian " names as 
Pritchard, Midgely, Johns, Knight, Naylor, 
Russell, Hazeitine, Berg, Wells, Kingsley, Robin- 
son, Armstrong, Ivens, Bray, Brown, Craig, and 
Irvine. 

The thing that finally impresses an observer of 
this new Canadian labor movement is the quiet 
calmness of its propaganda. There are a few bril- 
liant orators among them and a great many able 
exponents of the industrial union idea but the grjeat

educator of the Canadian workers has been the war. 
It was probably the ideological effect on the people 
of the war-time propaganda that has counted most 
in the awakening of labor, accompanied of course 
by the evolution of industrial conditions that drove 
home to them the impotency of craft unionism and 
the need of a form of labor organization that ran 
parallel to the organization of industry effected by 
the capitalists. The workers were told they were 
fighting for democracy. They were told they were 
fighting to make the world a better place to live in. 
They were told it was a war to end war. They 
were told that when it was finally won nothing 
would be too good for them and that the country 
belonged to them. In the meantime they saw the 
profiteers flourishing and the government prus- 
sianizing the Dominion with its Orders-in-Council 
against all the commonly accepted rights of man. 
When the war ended and reconstruction began -it 



found the Canadian workers preparing to profit by 
the lessons they had learned. Dependence upon 
political parties in the past had disillusioned them. 
The war had given them a sense of their economic 
power. They are beginning to understand what 
democracy really means and are demanding its ap- 
plication*, to their industrial life which they now 
recognize as being the all-important phase of life 
for the working class. They have learned that the 
way to end war is not by more militarism but by 
working class solidarity. They believed the prof- 
iteering patriots who told them the country be- 
longed to them in order to get them to fight for it 
and they are now proposing to take possession of 
their property. They believe, apparently, that the 
One Big Union is the instrument through which 
they will finally achieve these aims.

Military Paternalism and Industrial Unrest 



JL HE END OF the Great War marked for Amer- 
ica the consummation of one victory and the promise 
of another. The United States had shared lightly 
in the burden and richly in the glory of the 
Allied military triumph. Our industries, like our 
army, had been continuously and eagerly on the 
offensive, and were still far short of their potential 
striking force. Our resources in men, money, and 
materials were almost untouched, seemingly un- 
limited. Our factories and ships were ready 
and our ambitions were nowise behindhand. What 
we had done for the Allied cause in the war of 
nations we would soon be doing for ourselves in 
war for world markets. 

Such was the hope of big business here in Amer- 
ica. Such was the fear of our old-time competi- 
tors in exhausted Europe. Perhaps it was this 
fear of American commercial expansion as much 
as an anticipation of German resurgence that gave 
rise to the eagerness of England to acquire new 
markets and of France to annex fresh reservoirs 
of raw materials. And certainly it was self-confi- 
dence as much as altruism that made us indifferent 
to British and French expansion. The French 
were welcome to dig coal in German mines and the 
British to sell manufactures in German Africa; we 
would produce our own raw materials, work them 
up in our own factories, float them in our own 
ships, and sell them in every colonial and European 
market. For the time being at least, German 
competition could be disregarded. England was 
crippled by an enormous loss of man power, bur- 
dened by debt, short of materials and ships. 



France labored under even greater disabilities; for 
the present her ruined industrial region might be 
considered a liability rather than an asset. Italy 
was too poor to be a good customer, much less a 
rival. Japanese competition was more a threat 
than a present reality. The very capitals of colonial 
empires clamored for goods to fill the gap left by 
four and a half years of under-production and 
wholesale ruin. Wall Street saw all this, and Wall 
Street thought that America was about to become 
the exploiter of exploiters powerful enough to be 
imperially generous. 

Many of our captains of industry were so com- 
pletely consistent and so sure of their position that 
they were willing not only to countenance the 
imperialist expansion of France and England but, 
by subscribing to the League of Nations, to guar- 
antee the maintenance of the new status quo. Now 
it is commonly said that distaste for change, and 
tender solicitude for the preservation of law and 
order, are marks of those who have arrived. When 
solicitude for the lawful and orderly maintenance 
of a world-wide status quo is manifested by per- 
sons not noted for altruism, a thing or two 
may be inferred as to the extent of the power 
wielded by these persons. 

In fact our captains of industry found them- 
selves in a position to be generous, not only with 
foreign imperialism, but with American labor and 
the American government. War-time experience 
had proved beyond peradventure that under a 
regime of kindly regulation and with the backing 
of a safe-and-sane labor movement, the proprietary

class could reap richer profits than industry had 
ever been known to yield in the days when time 
and energy were dissipated in rights with the pol- 
iticians and the unions. Thus it came about that 
the biggest and canniest of big business men man- 
aged to combine with support of the League of 
Nations a most friendly attitude toward the gov- 
ernment and an " enlightened " policy toward the 
" legitimate " trade union movement. 

Now if the times fulfill their promise there is 
in store for these gentlemen a double disillusion- 
ment. In the first place, the League of Nations 
will not guarantee to us wide-open world markets, 
well-policed at somebody else's expense. And sec- 
ondly, the American labor movement will not be 
forever content with rule by the divine right of 
ownership, however enlightened this rule may be. 
Faced with the monopolistic policy of European 
nations ready to make good with military power 
what they lack in material resources threatened 
with the desertion of craft-union groups that have 
been considered as conservative as big business itself 
the new imperialism of peace and platitudes is 
doomed to failure. And already, before the fail- 
ure is everywhere acknowledged, the old imperial- 
ism comes forward with a panacea for all predica- 
ments military force. 

Foreign aggression against America is for the 
time being unthinkable. The nations are too 'much 
exhausted; plunder is too easily to be had else- 
where. Obviously a great army and an expanded 
navy are not necessary for the protection of Amer- 
ican shores against invasion. But if, contrary to 
the creed of the new imperialism, trade still fol- 
lows the flag if England, France, and Japan do 
actually plan to monopolize the valuable concessions 
in the territories they have won in Asia and in 
Africa and are perhaps to win in Eastern Europe 
then the United States must have arms to protect 
her commerce in the Far East and in the two 
Americas. And if the most respectable of labor 
groups is suddenly to exchange the policy of col- 
lective bargaining for a policy of nationalization 
that stirs the imagination of the firiest radicals, then 
certainly the time has come for the mobilization 
of all material and spiritual forces for the defense 
of decent and lawful exploitation at home and 
abroad. 

The feature of the mobilization plan that is 
receiving most attention just now is the proposal 
for universal military training. It goes without 
saying that, League or no League, the adoption of 
a universal training program would have a most 
salutary effect upon Japanese plans for monopoliz- 
ing the Far East, and would put us in a way to 
do a little monopolizing on our own account in 



Mexico and Central America. European domes- 
tic and colonial tariff policies would doubtless also 
be effected in a manner not unfavorable to Amer- 
ican interest. But more difficult to determine and 
of more immediate importance is the relation of 
universal military training to industrial unrest. 

In the consideration of this matter it is above 
all things necessary to distinguish sharply between 
war-time service and peace-time training. It is 
notorious that the experiences of the Great War 
bred in many men, not subservience, but radicalism 
of the kind since manifest in organizations that link 
dangerously the activities of Workmen and Sol- 
diers. In one class of cases, this radical spirit may 
be regarded as a kind of sport the offspring of 
the official union of militarism and idealism. Many 
of the men made radical by the war stood con- 
vinced at one time that the Fourteen Points and 
the several supplements thereto were worth fight- 
ing for. Like practically everybody else in the mili- 
tary service, they had no mental function in army 
routine that would suffice to keep them individ- 
ually alive, but they did somehow succeed in pre- 
serving their existence as individuals, in the face 
of the mechanization of the means of war, by a 
resurgent interest in its ends. And it is because 
of their interest in the ends of the war that 
these men are today disillusioned, disappointed, 
undesirable. 

Now the proponents of universal military train- 
ing need liave no fear that service in time of peace 
will produce radicalism of this sort, for if there is 
any one thing that characterizes a 'non-fighting 
army, and distinguishes it from all other large- 
scale organizations of humankind, it is that the 
army is all means, and no ends. Complications of 
administration and rigidly prescribed formalities 
of procedure have been developed to such a degree 
that the officers of the staff and the line and the 
men in the ranks manage to keep up a show of 
activity without ever getting anything done. It is 
because the army was everlastingly doing things 
to itself that it had so much trouble, at the out- 
break of the war, in making a start at doing some- 
thing to Germany. Civilian irregularity, enthu- 
siasm, and purposefulness never quite eliminated 
from the National Army must inevitably be 
squeezed out of the peace-time training system by 
" hard-boiled " sergeants, and professional officers 
whose pride it is that they feel nothing, know 
nothing, and do nothing except as " directed by 
higher authority." 

What is true of the army as an institution is as 
emphatically true of its individual members; their 
responsibilities have been pared down to an irre- 
ducible minimum; their business is to be not to 



1919 



THE DIAL 



produce. Pay, food, clothing, shelter, medical care, 
allowances, pensions, come automatically to even- 
man who can get into the service, keep alive, and 
obey purposeless orders without asking embarrass- 
ing questions. In many respects the soldier gets 
exactly the same treatment as is accorded to 
dependents, defectives, and delinquents in state 
institutions. Thus the military system, with its 
various charitable auxiliaries, deprives a man first 
of the facilities, and finally of the ability to take 
-care of himself. From the standpoint of animal 
existence, this sort of thing may be all very well 
as long as paternalism fulfills its function and 
shoes and " corned willie " come forth in due course. 
In war-time, men are even willing to endure cer- 
tain stoppages in the flow of provender. 

But the complete and sudden lapse of paternal- 
ism that has marked the demobilization period is 
another matter altogether. Men who have been 
cherished for two years by the government and 
the Red Cross and the Y. M. C. A. have come 
all at once to the end of irresponsibility; the 
stay-at-homes have given them chocolate and 
cigarettes and taken their jobs. To the radical- 
ism of the disappointed idealists who kept them- 
selves alive in spite of paternalism, there has thus 
been added the radicalism of disappointed stomachs 
that know not how to fill themselves without 
paternal aid. 

But the advocates of universal training have even 
less to fear from the radicalism of hunger than 
from the radicalism of disillusionment. The latter, 



born of a too keen consciousness of responsibility, 
is purely a war-time phenomenon ; with no war, 
no aims, and no illusions, there can be no disillu- 
sionment. The radicalism of hunger, on the other 
hand, is born of irresponsibility and is easily 
remediable by the extension of military paternalism 
to the industrial field. It was precisely this type 
of military-industrial organization that character- 
ized the neatly ordered Germany of pre-war days. 
And now, consciously or unconsciously, the 
advocates of universal military training propose 
the importation of this system into the United 
States. 

At a time when the very Senate is forced to dis- 
cuss the possibilities of the responsible control of 
production by the producers, American labor may 
find it advisable to face squarely the other great 
issue before the people. The leaders of the labor 
movement will do well to ponder upon the free 
and easy use of mobilization to break railroad strikes 
in France and England. They will do well to ask 
themselves more abstractly what labor has to 
gain from the triumph of imperialism abroad; and 
whether a universal apprenticeship in blind obed- 
ience and parasitic irresponsibility is the best prep- 
aration for self-government in industry at home. 
And above all these leaders who now hold fate in 
their hands will do well to consider first and now 
a question that European labor asks last, and 
often too late: "When we strike, what will the 

army do ? "

Like a proud pale lady 
With a rustling gown. 

And oh! 
How my heart 

Like the mist is light, 
When I hear you sing 

In the cool of night. 

O brown little singer, 
You sing from the dawn, 

Till the long dark shadows 
Cover up the lawn. 



And oh! 
Then I listen 

When the mist comes down 
Like a proud pale lady 

With a rustling gown. 

When the swallows blot 

The sunset sky, 
And the minstrel lark 

Has ceased his cry; 

Then oh! 
Brown singer 

In the woodway aisles, 
Your note is a prayer 

To the long tree files. 



And my heart is gay 

When the mist comes down 
Like a proud pale lady 

With a rustling gown.

The Ordeal of Reality 



J\. LL LITERATURE," wrote" Robert Louis Stev- 
enson in 1878 (Acs Triplex), " from Job and Omar 
Khayyam to Thomas Carlyle or Walt Whitman, 
is but an attempt to look upon the human state with 
such largeness of view as shall enable us to rise 
from the consideration of living to the Definition 
of Life." And a decade later, when the implica- 
tions of Darwinism were staggering the orthodox 
mind, he made his most thorough attempt to see life 
steadily and see it whole, in an essay which, what- 
ever its contribution to a philosophy of life, is an 
authentic contribution to literature. Pulvis et 
Umbra, discovering a Stevenson still reminiscent 
of the " sedulous ape " busy with a " laborious 
pasticcio of Sir Thomas Browne," also discovers a 
representative contemporary mind, fundamentally 
orthodox, which is staggered to the pitch of elo- 
quence by the current revolution in scientific 
notions : 

It is not strange if we are tempted to despair of good. 
iWe ask too much. Our religions and moralities have 
been trimmed to flatter us. ... The human race is a 
thing more ancient than the ten commandments; and the 
bones and revolutions of the Kosmos, in whose joints we 
are but moss and fungus, more ancient still. Of the 
Kosmos, in the last resort, science reports many doubtful 
things, and all of them appalling. . . . This stuff, when 
not purified by the lustration of fire, rots uncleanly into 
something we call life; seized through all its atoms with 
a pediculous malady; swelling in tumors that become in- 
dependent, sometimes even (by an abhorrent prodigy) lo- 
comotory. . . . And meanwhile our rotatory 'island 
loaded with predatory life, and more drenched with 
blood, both animal and vegetable, than ever mutinied 
ship, scuds through space with unimaginable speed, and 
turns alternate cheeks to the reverberation of a blazing 
world, ninety million miles away. 

But this brave gesture away from the anthropocen- 
tric conviction this iterated recognition of man as a 
" vital putrescence of the dust," a " disease of the 
agglutinated dust," a " hair-crowned bubble of the 
dust " swept " the browsers, the biters, the bark- 
ers " into the human fellowship only to bestow upon 
them the human strife to do well and use them to 
point the orthodox moral (" God forbid it should 
be man that wearies in well-doing "), before it came 
to rest in the attitude of faith and pious hope 
" surely not all in vain." 

A decade and a half more and this literary 
tradition, even to the sonorous echo of Browne's 
Hydrotaphia, was enriched by a more rigorously 
philosophical man of letters, Mr. Bertrand Russell. 
A Free Man's Worship (in Mysticism and Logic; 
Longmans, Green; 1918) recognized more clearly 



than ever Stevenson could the unconscious hostility 
of nature and the inevitable snuffing-out of human 
civilization, but restored to man his unique dignity 
as critic of the universe. It substituted " unyield- 
ing despair " for pious hope, and for conforming 
faith a proud defiance of " the irresistible forces 
that tolerate, for a moment, his knowledge and 
his condemnation." In a very recently published 
essay, Dreams and Facts (in the Athenaeum), 
Mr. Russell has reinforced this non-conformity 
with an examination of the wish-basis of " the day- 
dreams which we call beliefs:" 

Men's personal and group-dreams may be ludicrous, 
but their collective human dreams, to us who cannot pass 
outside the circle of humanity, are pathetic. ... In 
the visible world, the milky way is a tiny fragment; 
within this fragment, the solar system is an infinitesimal 
speck, and of this speck our planet is a microscopic dot. 
On this dot, tiny lumps of impure carbon and water . . . 
crawl about for a few years, until they dissolve again 
into the elements of which they are compounded.. They 
divide their time between labor designed to postpone the 
moment of dissolution for themselves, and frantic strug- 
gles to hasten it for others of their kind. 

But if this very insistence upon the immensity of 
the universe seem to impose man's mensuration on 
nature, to display in fact a left-handed if satirical 
anthropocentrism, make the most of that while you 
can; the concluding paragraph corrects it: 

There is a stark joy in the unflinching perception of 
our true place in the world, and a more vivid drama 
than any that is possible to those who hide behind the 
enclosing walls of myth. . . . No man is liberated 
from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it 
is ; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is 
capable until he has allowed himself to see his own little- 
ness. 

Certainly the Browne-Stevenson tradition has lost 
nothing of the picturesque and the dramatic under 
Mr. Russell's austerer pen. What it has gained 
is thrown into sharp relief by the short-comings of 
its latest contributor. 

This is Mr. H. G. Wells, who in many respects 
as blithe romancer, up-to-date sermonizer, and 
popular philosopher, no less than as the practiced 
stylist in mood and phrase is our generation's 
journalistic approximation of R. L. S. As doubt- 
less becomes an indefatigable writer of tracts, Mr. 
Wells did not, until recently, think the world 
intractable. To be sure, his heroes and heroines 
regularly failed to have their way with the world, 
but the fault was in themselves, or else in the per- 
versity of that human nature in which they were 
conscious partners and which they usually essayed 



1919 



THE DIAL

to reshape nearer to the heart's desire. Their 
reverses had the look of retribution for individual 
or collective error, for miscalculated (rather than 
incalculable) passion, for rebellious prejudice in 
the terms of the older orthodoxy, punishment for 
sin. And in those days you never put down a Wells 
novel dreaming though right were worsted, wrong 
would triumph; always there was the comfortable 
faith that, let the given instrument be broken, the 
cause went marching on and ultimately sweetness 
and light would prevail; you were left the pious 
hope of a democratic millennium. 

Latterly, however, Mr. Wells has been less sure 
of his world. In his generation nothing so simple 
as the origin of species or the descent of man could 
stagger him ; he has exploited, and is still exploiting, 
evolution with all the gusto his first fantastic inven- 
tions provoked in him. It is clear now that the 
thing which staggered Mr. Wells was the thing 
Mr. Britling was unable to see through alone: at 
the same time that the war took the bounce out 
of Mr. Britling's optimism, it inoculated his creator 
with a spiritual malaria. And it is possibly signif- 
icant of the novelist's representative relationship to 
his generation that with Mr. Britling Sees It 
Through he recaptured his place on the list of best- 
sellers in America. For there were campaigns dur- 
ing which other optimisms than Mr. Wells' sick- 
ened for a Lord of Hosts, and shortly there were 
other faiths in democracy that found it comforting 
to clasp the hand of an Invisible King preferably, 
of course, that of a constitutional monarch, or of a 
President of the Republic of Mankind, but in any 
event as firm a hand as might be. One suspects, 
moreover, that souls are among those organs that 
announce their existence only when they are ailing, 
and that when the Soul of a Bishop needs attention 
it may be symptomatic of an epidemic among the 
laity. Whether or not you regard the authors of 
Mr. Britling and the two succeeding novels as 
the victim of a spiritual epidemic, you can scarcely 
escape the fact of his malady. During three books 
or, more strictly, during two and a half books, 
for Mr. Britling really did see things half-way 
through the erstwhile confident peddler of New 
Worlds for Old looked as strangely on his new 
earth as must our forefathers when they were cred- 
itably informed that flat was round, or our fathers 
when they began to surmise the literal truth of their 
figurative "dust to dust." Stevenson was no 
swifter to fling a decent cloak of idealism round his 
suddenly naked Kosmos than Mr. Wells to cover 
this new earth of his with one new heaven after 
another. 



The onlooker barely had time to wonder what 
fault the creator had condemned in the previous 
member of this tragic dynasty before another head 
was in the basket! Then came Joan and Peter, 
which Randolph Bourne was encouraged to herald 
as a " complete convalescence " for Mr. Wells 
(The Relegation of God; The DIAL, September 
19, 1918.) Mr. Wells had put his "middle-class 
god ... . familiarly but decisively in his place," 
a dusty workshop in which the Old Experimenter 
said to Peter, " If you have no will to change it, 
you have no right to criticize it." This sounded 
like the ante-bellum Mr. Wells. And this world, 
subject to salvation through education, looked very 
much like that tractable world that had been for- 
ever about to yield to conscious control. 

But if Joan and Peter marked a convalescence, 
its successor, The Undying Fire (Macmillan), 
indicates a relapse. Once more Mr. Wells doubts 
whether the world can save itself; once more he 
invents a Redeemer to endorse his incorrigible mil- 
lennial hope. The Undying Fire depicts man's 
plight in the physical universe with so vivid an imag- 
ery and so moving an eloquence that it properly 
belongs in the line of the Browne-Stevenson tradi- 
tion. At the same time it fitfully approaches so 
near to the wise disillusion of Mr. Russell that its 
very fallings-short reinforce the lesson that there 
is salvation for us neither in Conscious Control, 
nor in Education, nor in faith in the Undying Fire 
of intuition of an organizing God at work in the 
hearts of men to make for orderly righteousness, 
nor in any hope-breeding mirage this newest anthro- 
pomorphic deity may dangle on the horizon of the 
desert of reality ; but only in " the unflinching per- 
ception of our true place " in an indifferent uni- 
verse. This is the only truth the knowledge of 
which can make us free. That Mr. Wells should 
perceive this truth, flinch,- and then rest his eyes 
upon the old Utopian horizon, is a symptom of the 
recrudescence, with a special virulence, of his spir- 
itual malady. 

"From Job and Omar Khayyam," wrote Stev- 
enson; and Mr. Wells has turned back to the Book 
of Job for the outline and personae of The Undy- 
ing Fire. (Would not the sounder author of Mr. 
Polly have turned to Omar?) The narrative set- 
ting of Job the wager in Heaven, Satan's swift 
rain of disasters, the three garrulous comforters, 
Elihu's reproof, Jehovah's voice in the whirlwind, 
Job's restoration he appropriates precisely as any- 
one may appropriate any myth and translates almost 
point for point into twentieth century terms. God 
concedes to Satan that Job of the Land of Uz has 



August 23 



now become mankind, and permits the Adversary 
to try Man to the uttermost: " See if he is indeed 
no more than a little stir amidst the slime, a fuss in 
the mud that signifies nothing." So Job Huss, a 
Wellsian schoolmaster, loses school-buildings, money, 
health, his son (reported killed at the front), and 
his wife's devotion everything but his flair for 
challenging God. To him come two trustees of his 
school, Sir Eliphaz Burrows and Mr. William 
Dad, and the science master, Mr. Joseph Farr, who 
covets Job's headmastership, all bent upon taking his 
very school from him. While he waits for the 
London specialist who is to operate upon him for 
cancer these three, like the three ancient worthies 
whose namesakes they are, sit down round him to 
rebuke him for his heterodoxy, which has been the 
Wellsian positivism in education, and to convict 
him of the sin his misfortunes seem to them to estab- 
lish. Fifty pages of talk, and enter Dr. Elihu 
Barrack, the local physician, to voice the rationalist 
rebuke. There are a hundred pages more of talk 
before the specialist arrives and operates. Then in 
a very short chapter, clearly a perfunctory coda that 
interests Mr. Wells even less than its model inter- 
ested the author of the Book of Job, Huss has 
restored to him his health, his money, his school, his 
son, and the dubious affection of his drab and selfish 
wife items for the groundlings, who must ever be 
shown material signs. 

Such is the myth-frame appropriated without 
an attempt to' make it square with reason for the 
altogether reasonable action of what Mr. Wells 
has called a " contemporary novel." Contemporane- 
ous it is, and with a journalistic vengeance; but it 
has about the same right to the term " novel " as 
one of the more vivid Platonic dialogues might have. 
The reproach is not to Mr. Wells, but to a public 
that, having ceased conversing, has ceased listening 
to- conversation except when a Shaw or Brieux gulls 
it with scenery, properties, and costumes, or a Wells 
decoys it with the appearance of narrative. The 
one hundred fifty pages of straight talking present 
Mr. Wells' newest contribution to the oldest prob- 
lem. The conversation is saturated with the brood- 
ing moodiness that is his signature. Between Job 
and Elihu, at least, it maintains for a time a certain 
new attitude of impartiality, an antiphonal elo- 
quence somewhat reminiscent of Lowes Dickinson's 
Modern Symposium. One almost begins to hope 
that Mr. Wells is on the road to recovery. Then 
his Undying Fire of a god sides with Huss, who has 
just passed under .the anesthetic. Where once Job 
heard Jehovah speak from the whirlwind, Huss now 
sees his god speak in " thoughts that ran like swift 



rivulets of fire through his brain and gathered into 
pools and made a throbbing pattern of wave- 
lets, curve within curve, that interlaced." And he 
is comforted with a mere " surely not all in 
vain." 

But Mr. Huss, always only a little less susceptible 
than Mr. Britling, is a very sick man; the tougher- 
minded who will have followed his desolating chal- 
lenges to this point will scarcely be comforted so 
easily. His landlady, when he told her he should 
be ill in her house, said to him in unconscious vers 
libre: " We 'ave to bear up with what is put upon 
us. We 'ave to find strength where strength is to 
be found. Very likely all you want is a tonic of 
some sort. Very likely you've just let yourself go. 
I shouldn't be surprised." Admirably exact in 
diagnosis and prescription! In order to bear up 
under all that had been put upon him, Mr. Huss 
did have to find strength wherever he could; and 
he really stood in dire need of a tonic long before 
he had ceased letting himself go. For instance, he 
could not defend himself from the charge that his 
suffering proved him a sinner without sketching for 
his orthodox visitors something of the universal 
misery in nature, a task congenial to his pain-ridden 
mood. And that led him into the world-old dilemma 
of the anthropomorphic worshipper: how can man 
trust such a creator to treat him fairly ? Either God 
is malignant, or He is indifferent. . . . Mr. 
Farr very properly challenges the insolence of his 
anthropomorphism; but if the universe is to be 
dehumanized, Mr. Huss can only cling with Pro- 
methean rebellion to the " fire of human tradition 
we have lit upon this little planet," until it shall be 
extinguished in the ultimate cold. The prospect is 
too much for Sir Eliphaz, who falls back upon the 
argument from design " the stately procession of 
life upon earth ... the glorious crescendo of 
evolution, up to its climax, man." But this, in turn, 
is altogether too easy for Mr. Huss: where now 
are the earlier products of that crescendo, and what 
evidence is there that man will not follow them into 
oblivion ? So Sir Eliphaz drops his " apologetics for 
the scheme of Nature " and goes in for the moral- 
gymnasium view of the world and " voluptuous 
whiffs of immortality." Here he has behind him 
" two thoroughly scientific men, Dr. Conan Doyle 
and Sir Oliver Lodge," the latter of whom has 
behind him " that wonderful thinker and how he 
thinks Professor Bergson." Abruptly all these 
have before them not only Job Huss but Dr. Elihu 
Barrack as well, to whose shrewd questions Sir 
Eliphaz replies blandly, " We don't know. Why 
should we ? " Mr. Huss however will " not hear

of a God who is just a means of getting away." 
Having but now lost his son, he knows only too well 
that " personal immortality," with every defect 
ironed out, " is a mockery of our personalities. . . . 
The immortal thing in us is the least personal 
thing " to wit, the 'Undying Fire and by that 
tonic fire he lives. 

So far Job Huss has pretty much dominated the 
conversation with his personal demands upon the 
universe his humanism, his private sense of jus- 
tice, the somewhat hysterical rebellion kindled in 
him by the Undying Fire. Now begins the duel 
with Dr. Barrack. The doctor is not long in 
demonstrating that he has the only consistently 
" tough " mind in the company. There is no panic 
in the clear eye which recognizes that the waning 
of his instincts will prelude his extinction; mean- 
while he maintains a lively and intelligent curiosity 
about the continuity of things, which he calls 
The Process; The Process conditions him, and 
he is resigned to it without illusion. That Mr. 
Wells retains at least enough mental health to be 
interested in this type of mind is indicated not only 
in the comparative impartiality of Barrack's pres- 
entation, but also in the fact that Barrack is per- 
mitted a rival pedagogical theory and the scope to 
support it cogently. To Huss the " modern fatal- 
ism " of this sort of mind is " submissive." Yet 
it has vitality and the ring of integrity; here, 
admittedly, it is coarse, perhaps a little obscurantist, 
but it could take a very much finer edge with no 
sacrifice of temper. The Huss mind, on the con- 
trary, by far the more delicate instrument, grows 
more and more " tender," seems more and more to 
recoil from reality: it worries about Russia, where 
it amazingly finds that " art, science, reasoned 
thought, creative effort, such things have ceased 
altogether " ; it gets persuaded that " the supreme 
fact is exhaustion " (a very different note from 
Barrack's " waning instincts ") ; it is a little panicky 
in opposing evil " disorder," that is, plural fact 
a little housewifely in proposing the monism of 
cooperative tidiness; it agonizes too much about the 
"Adversary." You come to feel that it has over- 
trained. As the debate advances to its Pentecostal 
close, Huss leans more and more desperately upon 
the faith that is in him, Barrack more and more 
confidently upon his critical intelligence. Though 
Mr. Wells would have you believe that nothing but 
the advent of the London surgeon saves Barrack 
from' discomfiture, the truth is that it is Huss who 
has been saved from maudlin dogma. Under the 
anesthetic he recovers courage, appropriately, from 
the god within him; but the visitation comes late, 



when the debate has been concluded, and as a 
tonic wish rather a fulfillment of his faith than 
as an answer to any challenge. 

Not thus did Jehovah come to Job. Job, it will 
be remembered, had steadily deepened his skepticism, 
sharpened his challenge to the imperative " let God 
reply ! " In the poem it was Job who was hetero- 
dox, Elihu who was orthodox. Did Mr. Wells 
miss the significance of the poem? Or did he 
deliberately invert the roles of Job and Elihu? In 
either event he has proved himself a more thorough 
conformist than the forgotten author of the Book 
of Job, longer on obstinate belief, shorter on cour- 
ageous reason. Dr. Barrack should have been the 
protagonist of his modern version. That he is 
not is the measure of the novelist's decline since he 
discovered the recalcitrance of the world and the 
tractability of God. 

Before Mr. Wells wrote The Undying Fire he 
should have had access to H. M. Kallen's volume 
The Book of Job as a Greek Tragedy Restored 
(Moffat, Yard). Mr. Kallen understands both 
Job and God a great deal better than Mr. Wells 
does, and his penetrating discussion of their rela- 
tion to each other provides a guide to reality and 
to " the excellence proper to man " that is both 
sound and bracing. It is " a brave book to take 
counsel with." His daring, ingeniously supported 
hypothesis that the author of The Book of Job 
really wrote in the Euripidean manner, though it 
demands a minimum of textual rearrangement, for 
the first time offers Job a version coherent enough 
to let him speak out clearly for himself, released at 
last from the web of interested exegesis that has 
^entangled him. He now speaks for himself so con- 
vincingly that this report of him is likely to obtain, 
whatever critical fate overtakes Mr. Kallen's 
hypothesis or historical commentary. 

The hypothesis is seriously entertained by Gilbert 
Murray and George Foot Moore, whose introduc- 
tion to the volume sketches the history of the 
notion that the Book of Job was originally a drama. 
We cannot follow here the plausible considerations 
that Mr. Kallen adduces in support of his conjec- 
ture: the various avenues by which Hellenic 
influences could have reached the author of the 
poem, the numerous resemblances to the Euripidean 
form that its surviving text reveals, and so on. Let 
it suffice us that the " restored " tragedy functions 
successfully both on the stage it was performed at 
Milwaukee and at Madison in 1913 and at Boston 
in 1916 and in the closet. Our concern now is 
with the story and the philosophy of Job, the long- 
suffering.

THE DIAL 



August 23 



Mr. Kallen regards the piece as a dramatic treat- 
ment of an older legend. That prepares us for 
the prologue (in prose here) that relates " the 
orthodox preliminary version of the story." The 
action (in verse) begins with the arrival of the 
comforters, each of whom Eliphaz, Bildad, and 
Zophar has speeches between the choral passages 
(in a different meter) that separate the three 
rounds of speeches. Elihu is made the leader of 
the chorus; and his long speeches, coming at the 
end of the third round and not replied to by any 
of the principals, give him the messenger's function 
of announcing Jehovah, who speaks from the whirl- 
wind in reply to Job's challenge which closes this 
round. During the epiphany Job replies twice to 
Jehovah. Then all except Job file off, the chorus 
chants the final lines off-stage, and the epilogue 
again in prose and again Euripidean in its orthodox 
account of Job's later history closes the drama. 
It is perhaps the conclusion of the old prose 
legend. 

Now, it is Mr. Kallen's idea that the preserva- 
tion of the poem in any form is probably due to 
its superficial orthodoxy. Satan is empowered to 
try Job to the utmost; Job endures everything, 
neither renouncing God nor confessing the sin he 
has not committed, asking only that God appear and 
endorse his " faith " ; this God does in the conven- 
tional manner, afterward rewarding him and 
punishing his " enemies." Nothing could be more 
innocent, especially as the choruses are entirely 
orthodox. But inside this conventional frame, in 
true Euripidean fashion, there takes place an emo- 
tional and intellectual drama which carries Hebraic 
philosophical speculation to the summit of its dar- 
ing. Thus disguised, the essential heterodoxy of 
Job's thinking somehow escaped the censorship of 
the priestcraft. Says Mr. Kallen: 

The situation at the end of this agon [the third round] 
must have been, from the point of view of orthodox Jewry, 
intolerable. The mood of Job has changed in the course 
of the dialogue from unhappy complaint to heroic defiance. 
The argument has moved from the position that (1) God 
sends undeserved misfortunes on the righteous, through the 
demonstration that (2) he deals prosperity to the wicked, 
to the final position that (3) an omnipotent and unattain- 
able God is of no use to the just man who suffers, and 
who demands that God shall justify himself. The friends 
have grown weaker as Job has grown stronger. From 
argument they have passed to iteration. The intellectual 
and emotional situation at the end is the reverse of the 
situation at the beginning. 

At this point Elihu, as messenger, provides a 
recapitulation to tell the audience that the three 
champions of Jehovah have failed and prepares it 
for Jehovah's appearance on his own behalf. When 
the voice does come to answer Job's challenge, it is 



to turn the tables on Job by challenging him to be 
as God if he would argue with God. Weak and 
ignorant as he is, what is he that God should be 
mindful of him? 

Who hath first given unto me that I should repay him? 
Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine. 

How, then, should God owe anything to Job ? And 
Job replies, " Behold, I am of small account " ; says 
he has spoken " without understanding," expecting 
more than his due because he has known God " only 
by hearsay"; now that he understands, he recalls 
his challenge and is comforted even " amid dust and 
ashes." 

" The only consolation a brave man needs," said 
Phillips Brooks, " is explanation." Commenting on 
the orthodox solution of Job, Mr. William J. 
Hutchins writes in The Religious Experience of 
Israel (Association Press) : 

Observe he has seen no explanation of his suffering; 
he has passed beyond the need of explanation ; he has 
seen God. 

This would be only another God of escape, like 
the one Sir Eliphaz craved and Mr. Huss rejected. 
Job has not, to be sure, received a direct explana- 
tion of his suffering; what he has received is an 
explanation of God's indifference alike to his suffer- 
ing and to his conduct. His mind has been tough- 
ened to endure reality the cosmic justice that plays 
no favorites. Finally, he has learned that he must 
measure his justification by his personal integrity 
rather than by his good or ill fortune. He now 
stands, in fact, in the relation of Dr. Barrack to 
the Process ; but it should be noted to his credit that 
he has anticipated Dr. Barrack by the many cen- 
turies that are to develop modern science and pave 
the way for the latter's achievement. 

Men fortified as Job and Barrack are can take a 
great deal of punishment from a universe that was 
not made for them, which may at any instant do 
away with Athena, in which they are their proper 
selves without assistance or reward from any god. 
It is impossible to feel the same confidence in Mr. 
Huss. His tenderer mind is suffering from some 
cosmic shell-shock and will never quite rid itself 
of its futile rebellion, of the hallucination that is 
its private god, and of the ultimate illusion of hope. 
Mr. Wells selected the wrong hero for his con- 
temporary version of The Book of Job. Did he 
overlook Dr. Barrack's claims because, as " Sey- 
mour Deming " has remarked, those of us who can- 
not endure the ordeal of reality cannot even endure 
that others should endure it?

Deportation of Hindu Politicals 



ARE MODERN POLICY of all nations, especially 
the powerful and aggresive ones, toward national 
sovereignty, is to permit each nation to be its own 
judge as to whom it shall admit and whom exclude 
from the country. In accordance with this principle 
immigration laws exist, ostensibly to protect the 
rights of the natives of a country. 

The immigration laws of the United States have 
become more and more restrictive with the growth 
of America as a world power. Section 3 of the Immi- 
gration Laws, (Act of February 5, 1917, with rules 
of May 1917), discusses in detail the cases of those 
excluded from the country. Whoever enters the 
country in violation of any of these clauses is liable 
to be arrested for deportation, with this condition: 

Provided, that nothing in this act shall exclude, if other- 
wise admissable, persons convicted, or who admit the 
commission or who teach or advocate the commission of 
an offense purely political. 

The above clause also occurs in the latter part 
of the same section and distinctly shows that the 
Immigration Laws recognize political offenses. 
Political offenders are also given special and distinct 
status by the above clause. (Political offenses, ac- 
cording to the recognized interpretation of that 
term, are those which are not directed against the 
person or the property of an individual for purely 
selfish motives). Thus it is evident that the framers 
of the law intended that no technical violation of 
any of the clauses of Section 3 should be construed 
to secure the deportation of any one whose offense 
is merely political ; that is, those who have done no 
harm to property or person, or to the institutions of 
this country. This has been the custom of self- 
respecting states in their dealings with politicals. 
All the more so, when these deportations may end 
in the death of the political deportees. 

It is a disgrace to America that at the present time 
six Hindus are facing charges for deportation to 
India, and that many more are in imminent danger 
of similar proceedings. These Hindus are charged 
with the violation of some of the statutes of war; 
but it is obvious to the unprejudiced that, in so. 
far as they may have broken any law of this coun- 
try, it has been unintentional and without malice. 
Their sole purpose was the emancipation of India 
from an autocratic foreign rule, namely, that of the 
British. Their offense is thus purely political, and 
violates American law only in a technical sense. 

It is especially interesting to know how some of 
the clauses of Section 3 are being stretched and 



misconstrued to secure the deportation of the Hin- 
dus. The charges against them are three: (i) 
conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude; 
(2) making false statements upon entering the 
country, and (3) becoming, or likely to become, a 
public charge. 

The Hindus were charged with and convicted of 
violating the neutrality laws of this country by try- 
ing to ship arms and ammunition from the .United 
States to India in their attempt to free their coun- 
try from all alien domination. Can their offense be 
construed to be a crime involving moral turpitude? 
They were inspired by ideals of the highest order 
devotion to the suffering, hungry millions of 
Hindustan. There is no doubt in the minds of those 
who know these active altruists that their sole mo- 
tive was love for freedom. Their one purpose was 
to emancipate their native land. If this is moral 
turpitude, is there any action which is not? If this is 
not a political offense, is there any which is? If this 
is criminal, what is not criminal? What about 
Franklin and Adams? Were they criminals? Were 
they guilty of moral turpitude, too? 

Judge Noyes of the Circuit Court has attempted 
an explicit answer. (U. S. ex. rel. Mylius v. Uhl. 
203, Federal 152.) In this case the court held that 
a definition sufficiently accurate was this: 

An act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the pri- 
vate and social duties which a man owes to his fellow- 
man or to society. (Cit. 20. American and English 
Encyclopedia of Law.) 

Adopting this we may say that a crime involves 
moral turpitude when its nature is such that it 
manifests upon the part of its perpetrator personal 
depravity or baseness. 

The second charge, that of making false state- 
ments upon entering the country, is vague and can- 
not be verified. To bring it against men who have 
resided in this country for many years, as a tech- 
nicality to deport them to their deaths, is contrary 
to common understanding, and departs from the 
fundamental idea of law and justice; to stretch 
technicalities so far is a gross abuse of law, as well 
as of the human intellect. 

The last Charge, that of becoming, or likely to 
become, a public charge, needs careful consideration. 
The following sections of the Immigration Laws 
deal with this question: 

Rule 22, Subsection 4: Proof in cases of aliens who 
have become public charges: the application in such cases 
must be accompanied by a certificate of the official in 



146 



THE DIAL 



August 23 



charge of the institution in which the alien is confined or 
other responsible public official if the alien is not confined, 
showing that the alien is being maintained at public ex- 
pense. There should be submitted also whenever readily 
available, evidence tending to show that the causes of 
alien's being a public charge existed prior to entry. 

Section 21: That any alien liable to be excluded because 
likely to become a public charge. . . if otherwise ad- 
missable, nevertheless be admitted at the discretion of the 
Secretary of Labor upon giving a proper and suitable 
bond or undertaking approved by the said Secretary 
. . . against such alien becoming a public charge. 

These two paragraphs show clearly that in order 
to become a public charge an alien must be main- 
tained by some public institution of a charitable 
nature; it is a question for debate whether prisons 
and jails are recognized as charitable institutins. 
And the very fact that aliens may be admitted on 
giving a certain bond points inevitably to the con- 
clusion that economic reasons alone were intended 
to decide the status of becoming a public charge. 

The Hindus held for deportation have never ac- 
cepted a cent from any public institution of any kind, 
nor are they financially dependent upon any chari- 
table organization. They are all able-bodied, young, 
and enthusiastic men, and are engaged in regular 
business. This charge is ridiculous. The Depart- 
ment of Labor, however, when asked how public 
charges could be applied to them, presented a hair- 
splitting argument to the effect that at the time of 
their entry they were " likely to come into conflict 
with our laws and to be convicted and incarcerated 
for such crime." Thus the administration of a 
democratic country defines public charge! 

A jail is maintained by public revenues, and men 
forced to occupy them become dependent upon public 
revenues, and thus become public charges. Has 
there been any such interpretation of the spirit of 
the laws in any purely autocratic country, barring 
a few exceptions, such as India? This misreading 
of the law makes every person in America a poten- 
tial public charge, and as such anyone can be ar- 
rested today on the assumption that tomorrow he 
may commit an offense and become dependent upon 
public revenues. Is it decent for the state to create 
a situation like this, and then blame its victim? If 
this were the intention of the framers of the laws, 
what is the use of such elaborate, detailed immigra- 
tion laws with so many checks and counterchecks? 

The question next arises, are men, forced into 
prison against their will and desire, public 
charges? Do they become charges upon public re- 
venues? From a purely monetary viewpoint, do 
they not, by their forced labor, contribute more 
than they consume? The State exacts human labor 
from them, occasionally paying a few cents a day, 
more often paying nothing; the prisoners would be 
highly paid for the same labor outside of prison. 



They are paying for the upkeep of their prisons; 
the State does not pay for them. 

Why is the present administration so anxious to 
violate the sacred tradition of America that of 
granting asylum to political refugees from oppressed 
and subject nationalities? Why is it the Hindus 
are chosen, and not the Koreans or the Irish? The 
reason is not far to seek; the Irish are politically 
strong; the Koreans are not British subjects. I 
have seen copies of a letter and of documents, now 
in the possession of the Friends of Freedom for 
India, at the offices of that organization at 7 East 
15 Street, New York, from A. Carnegie Ross, 
British Consul General at San Francisco, which 
show the extent to which American officials are 
being influenced by foreign agents, and why Amer- 
ica is becoming an accomplice of a foreign power 
in^ deliberately turning men over to their execu- 
tioners. Ross expressed his willingness to furnish 
sufficient evidence to deport the Hindus who work 
for the freedom of India, if what he had supplied 
proved insufficient. To such a source the immigra- 
tion authorities turn for material evidence. 

These shameless un-American proceedings have 
brought in strong protests from Americans from all 
sections of the country. The President of the 
American Federation of Labor has asked Secretary 
of Labor William B. Wilson to take favorable 
action, and openly stated, at the Pan-American Con- 
ference of Labor, that American Labor will not 
stand for the deportation of aliens for purely politi- 
cal offenses. The A. F. of L. Convention at 
Atlantic City, the Chicago Federation of Labor, 
the California State Convention of the Sons of 
Irish Freedom, the Central Federated Council of 
San Francisco, the Central Federated Union of New 
York City, and various local and international 
organizations of labor affiliated with the A. F. of 
L. have all protested against the action of the De- 
partment of Labor. The Friends of Freedom for 
India, an American organization, came into being 
as a protest against these deportations, and as a 
champion of the Hindus who work for the inde- 
pendence of India. Even Mexico raised its voice. 
The Socialist Party of Mexico, in annual convention 
in Mexico City last week, protested to America 
against these actions as " flagrant violations of in- 
ternational law and morality," and then pointedly 
asked for the privilege of receiving these Hindu 
refugees into Mexico, in lieu of America's turning 
them over to a " relentless enemy." 

But does the Department of Labor cease its 
efforts to deport the Hindus? Its answer has been 
to increase the bail of one of them Bhagwan Singh 
from $3000 to $10,000 and to close his case and 



1919

refuse him the ordinary right of presenting testi- 
mony in his own defense. It went further: it went 
into the Federal Penitentiary at McNeill Island, 
Washington, where Mr. Singh was confined, and 
there, weeks before his prison term expired, tried 
him for deportation. A Star Chamber proceeding 
within prison walls! And then, on July 14, after 
he had served his full prison term, he left prison 
with his arms manacled, to face a second and. more 
terrible punishment for the " crime " of loving his 
country too well ! This treatment will not be con- 
fined to him alone, however. Another Hindu, 



Santokh Singh, finishes his prison term in September. 
He has already been arrested for deportation, and 
is held in $3000 bail. This also will be increased 
if the Hindu workers furnish the* amount already 
named. Taraknath Das, in Leavenworth, a 
naturalized American citizen, will come from 
prison in October, to face revocation of his citizen- 
ship in order that he, too, may be turned over to a 
government which he repudiated, whose theories and 
practices he renounced, and allegiance to which he 
refused, when he became an American citizen. 

SAILENDRA NATH GHOSE. 



A 



Deportation and Political Policy 



T THE SPRING CONFERENCE on labor and busi- 
ness problems held by Governors and Mayors in 
the White House at Washington, Secretary Wilson 
of the Department of Labor appeared and read a 
telegram from the Central Federated Union of New 
York protesting against the deportation of aliens 
because of their reputed connection with labor 
strikes. Mr. Wilson summarized the attitude of 
the Government as follows: 

No one is being deported because of his union affilia- 
tions and strike activities. It is the duty of the Secretary 
of Labor to deport all who advocate the overthrow of 
government by force, but no one will be deported because 
he is a radical. 

Let us compare this assertion with the immigra- 
tion inspector's record in the case of John Berg, one 
of the 50 or more aliens brought to Ellis Island on 
February 8 last for deportation: 

After considering the testimony in this case, I find that 
John Berg is an alien, a subject of Denmark; that he 
entered the United States through the port of San Fran- 
cisco, Cal., without inspection on or about May, 1901 ; 
that he has been found advocating or teaching the unlaw- 
ful destruction of property subsequent to his entry into 
the Uiiited States by reason of his connection <u>ith and the 
support he has given to the I. W. W. organization, and I 
therefore respectfully recommend he be ordered deported 
to the country whence he came, and of the country of 
which he is a citizen or subject, in conformity with law. 
Thomas M. Fisher, Immigration Inspector. 

Apparently the sole reason for the proposed de- 
portation of John Berg was that set forth in the 
italicized passage, since no other charge is made 
against him in the inspector's report, beyond the 
somewhat contemptuous assertion that Berg " is a 
typical member of the migratory herd of which the 
majority of this organization is composed." Berg 
was not charged with " advocating the overthrow 
of the government by force," and the only quotation 
from his utterances in regard to property is furnished 
by the inspector, who records Berg as saying in a 
typical workingman's inarticulate fashion : 



I believe in property; I don't believe in destroying it; 
we are not teaching to destroy property; we are teaching 
to get the value of our work. 

Again, there is the case of Henry W. Watts, 
arrested with several other aliens in the State of 
Washington and taken before Immigration Inspec- 
tors Fisher and Burford in the months of November 
and December, 1917. Mr. Fisher in recommending 
the deportation of Watts made the following written 
observations : 

There is no evidence to support this charge as to any 
individual act of the alien. His beliefs, however, and the 
order of which he is a member and active worker are such 
as would make it very probable that he has been teaching 
and advocating anything and everything in the interest of 
himself and this order. He has been publishing a news- 
paper in Everett and has been a street speaker and active 
organizer for the People's Council. He was posted as to 
the laws of the United States and was undoubtedly pre- 
pared to defend himself on all charges contained in the 
warrant. 

The passages deemed most worthy of attention 
here have also been italicized. That they indicate 
an official attitude entirely at variance with the 
traditions which the United States has ever held 
most dear is of course quite plain. 

Again, in connection with Secretary Wilson's de- 
nial that any alien is being deported merely for 
strike activities, the following report written by 
Inspector Fisher and contained in the official records 
of the Bureau of Immigration is worthy of examina- 
tion: 

I have to report, that yesterday Deputy U. S. Marshal 
Wainwright, while at Mount Vernon, Wash., learned that 
a strike had been called in one of the lumber companies 
by a number of I. W. W. members and that some of the 
said members had been taken into custody by the sheriff 
of Skagit County. Mr. Wainwright telephoned U. S. At- 
torney Allen, who in turn telephoned me, requesting that 
this service start a deportation action against the alien 
ringleaders of the strike. 

At the same time the sheriff of Mount Vernon tele- 
phoned regarding Ben Hagmark, who he stated was an 



148 



THE DIAL 



August 23 



alien and an I. W. W. agitator. I accordingly requested 
Deputy Marshal Wainwright to bring the man to this city 
for investigation. Upon the man's arrival he admitted his 
connection with the organization and his belief therein. 
Papers and documents found in his possession indicate 
that he was an organizer of the order. 

The statements contained in these official records 
are not easily to be reconciled with the public pro- 
nouncements of Secretary Wilson. But hasty accu- 
sations against the Secretary should not be made on 
this account. It is only reasonable to suppose that 
if it be true, as the press has reported, that 6,000 
other aliens have been " rounded up " within the 
last few months for eventual deportation, that the 
Secretary could not have possibly found the time to 
examine each case thoroughly before approving the 
warrants of deportation ; and that without doubt he 
was forced to rely more or less on the reports of 
his agents in the field. 

But this makes all the more plain the fact that 
our present system of deportation, set up under our 
loosely worded immigration laws, confers dangerous 
powers upon local inspectors powers that can be 
easily abused in cases of personal grudge and indi- 
vidual .prejudice, or in situations where the claims 
of capital and labor are involved. 

In fact, it has apparently enabled immigration 
inspectors of the northwestern states, especially in 
centres where industrial unrest has 'been particularly 
marked, to conduct a species of crusade against mem- 
bers of the Industrial Workers of the World, which 
organization, whatever may be said or thought of 
it, has not yet been declared an outlawed order ; and 
its members are, therefore, entitled to the .same 
rights and privileges as those granted to other classes 
of inhabitants. Phrases such as " jobless hobo", 
" scum of the earth," " undesirable," and so forth, 
occur altogether too often in local inspectors' reports 
to make it certain that they have been acting purely 
as unbiased officers of the law. 

One inspector, Henry M. Moler of Denver, Col., 
goes so far as to report on a case in the spirit of a 
prosecuting attorney. In the official records regard- 
ing August Lipman, one of the aliens brought to 
Ellis Island on the "Red Special," Inspector Moler 
comments as follows: 

It is about time we got down to business and stamped 
out sedition, disloyalty, Socialism, and this anarchistic or- 
ganization, the Industrial Workers of the World, who 
teach the confiscation and distribution of property. Every 
alien who is found to be a member of the I. W. W. should 
be deported, being unfit for citizenship in this country. 

A further examination of the records in the hands 
of Immigration Commissioner General Caminetti 
makes it appear that not only are local inspectors 
permitted to act as prosecutors unretmked, but also 



to perform the functions of informer, investigator, 
trial judge, and stenographer. In certain cases it is 
also revealed that they have taken it upon them- 
selves to offer parole to a prisoner upon condition 
that he refrain from further activities in a certain 
organization, though no such authorization exists 
under the terms of the law they are charged with 
enforcing. 

The practices of the immigration authorities have 
occasionally drawn a protest even from the courts. 
In the case of the United States ex rel. Bosny v. 
Williams, Judge Holt made the following com- 
ment: 

The person arrested does not necessarily know who in- 
stigated the prosecution. He is held in seclusion and is 
not permitted to consult counsel until he has been finally 
examined under oath. The whole proceeding is usually 
substantially in control of one of the inspectors, who acts 
in it as informer, arresting officer, inquisitor, and judge. 
The Secretary who issues the order of deportation is an 
administrative officer who sits hundreds of miles away 
and never sees or hears the person proceeded against or 
the witnesses. 

In short, the enforcement of our immigration laws 
has given rise to a lettre de cachet system under 
which the victim may be whisked away from his 
place of employment or from his home, and placed 
in jail without previous warning; without being 
informed of the nature of the charge against him; 
and without being given an opportunity to arrange 
his affairs. 

He may be held in a county jail virtually incom- 
municado anywhere from a year to fifteen months 
before an order for deportation is even issued against 
him. Some of the " Red Special " aliens, for 
example, were arrested in December 1917 and Jan- 
uary 1918, and kept in prison until February 1919, 
when they were taken across the continent to Ellis 
Island, there again to be confined indefinitely until 
ships could be found to carry them away. 

Nominally, aliens threatened with deportation 
have the right to employ legal counsel, but in prac- 
tice the presence of a lawyer at a hearing is not 
always of help. There are cases on record in which 
the defending attorney has been given to under- 
stand that by appearing in labor cases he was incur- 
ring the possible loss of his regular practice and was 
bringing down upon his head the hostility of the 
employers of the community. 

Nominally, too, the writ of habeas corpus is 
always available, but in practice officials may render 
it virtually useless. For example, Charles R. Recht, 
an attorney who has often appeared for aliens 
brought to Ellis Island under charges, tells a story 
of a case in which subordinate employees of the 
Immigration Bureau placed so many obstacles in the 



1919 



THE DIAL 



149 



way of a lawyer seeking to have a writ signed, that 
his representative was finally compelled to smuggle 
it to the detained prisoner in his socks. 

The tendency of the spirit of small-souled bureau- 
cracy to take possession of goverment employees has 
been often observed, but when the acts of such em- 
ployees are subject only to the review of a depart- 
mental chief, situated perhaps more than a thousand 
miles away, the abuses possible under such an 
arrangement are of course without number. 

Despite his protestations, Secretary Wilson's con- 
science could not have been easy, or he would not 
have permitted the release of fourteen of the " Red 
Special " prisoners after they had been confined on 
Ellis Island for several weeks. These fourteen men, 
all of whom are either members of or supporters of 
the Industrial Workers of the World, were released 
ostensibly on parole, but since they flatly refused to 
agree to such a parole, their release amounts to a 
clear recession on the part of immigration officials 
from their previously announced position. 

What caused this change of front on the part of 
Secretary Wilson is not known, but doubtless the 
growing volume of protest set up by the labor unions, 
which saw in the deportation system a new and 
dangerous weapon made available for employers, had 
something to do with it. 

That the Secretary has made no change in his 
general policy, however, is indicated by the fact that 
nine more persons, described as " undesirable aliens," 
were brought to Ellis Island for deportation almost 
at the same time that the fourteen were released. 
Two of these are the Misses Hoy, Scotch girls who 
came to Lawrence, Mass, a few years ago, became 
" infected " with I. W. W'ism there, and later 
moved to Seattle where they were arrested, when 
acting as union organizers. Secretary Wilson has 
laid himself open to trouble in this instance for the 
Scotch element in the labor unions of the East are 
already reminding him that he is of Scotch birth 
himself, came to this country as an immigrant lad, 
and in later years was arrested more than once in 
the course of his activities in the organization of the 
coal miners' union, of which he was one of the 
founders. An ironical touch is thus lent to the 
whole situation by the fact: that if our present im- 
migration laws had prevailed at that time and if 
the interpretation of them had been the same, the 
Secretary himself could have been deported as an 
undesirable alien. 

But the question involved in these deportation 
cases is, after all, larger than that of prejudiced 
immigration inspectors and blindly-acting official 
machinery. To face it would require a revision in 



our entire attitude toward our foreign-born class of 
manual workers. 

What should determine their right to remain in 
the country and to improve their material condition 
without the threat of jail and deportation hanging 
over them? There are 13 millions of them in this 
country, according to Labor Department figures. 
They have patiently performed the exacting labors, 
the hard, disagreeable tasks, which our native-born 
workmen have shrunk from. They have laid our 
railroad tracks, mined our coal, forged our steel, 
woven our cloth, and packed our tin cans. 

On what terms are they to be regarded as citizens 
with guaranteed rights? Are five years' residence 
and the ability to pay fees for certain papers to con- 
stitute the whole of the necessary qualifications? Is 
there not, in a very real sense, a citizenship of 
industry as well as of political areas? Should not 
years of toil and of wealth production entitle an 
alien to feel that he has a stake in the country a 
stake from which he cannot be easily separated ? Is 
he not entitled to feel that his person and home are 
safe from arbitrary acts that menace him with virtual 
exile ? 

A political citizen of the United States is guaran- 
teed certain rights, among which are an inviolable 
home, the protection of his person and property, the 
right of habeas corpus proceedings when imprisoned, 
reasonable bail limits, and punishment, if inflicted, 
that shall not be cruel, unusual, or excessive. But 
under our immigration laws and especially under 
the amendment of October 191 8, beginning with the 
fatally loose clause which permits the deportation of 
" aliens who are anarchists," an unnaturalized work- 
man of foreign origin, no matter how long has been 
his service in industry, can be sure of none of these 
things. 

Local immigration inspectors have been permitted 
to conduct themselves so as to convince the alien 
workman that if he is caught indulging himself in 
acts or opinions repellent to employers, he renders 
himself liable to sudden deportation to a land which 
he may not have seen since childhood and which in 
language and customs may be as strange to him as 
Kamchatka. 

It must not be supposed that the term " exile " is 
too strong to be used in this connection. Even the 
court in the Federal case of Redfern v. Halpert felt 
called upon to remark: 

It seems to me that no greater hardship could be oc- 
casioned than by deporting an alien who had come to this 
country at a tender age and lived here until after majority. 
Deportation in such cases is tantamount to exile.

A 



The Meaning of National Guilds 



. MERICA is STILL all but unaware of the meaning 
of national guilds. The more advanced English 
trade unions are discussing them and revising their 
demands accordingly. In Germany, says Mr. H. 
N. Brailsford after a recent visit, " the popular ex- 
pedient is to attempt a compromise of the Soviet 
system, on something like the English Guild Social- 
list lines." What, then, are these national guilds, 
and why are they? 

The essence of the idea is seen to be compara- 
tively simple as soon as two central principles are 
held in view. The first is the principle of func- 
tion; that is, the principle that organizations should 
be so constituted that they have a job to do and are 
adapted to its performance by having those involved 
in doing the job and affected by the consequences of 
its doing, as parties to its control. This means that 
jurisdiction must be coextensive with knowledge 
and competence in action; that fundamentally suffi- 
cient authority resides in any functional group to 
allow it adequately to perform its function; that 
instead of creating some abstract separation of 
powers (into legislative, executive, judicial), gov- 
ernment should be based on a realistic analysis of 
the different functions to be performed. 

The second principle is nominally familiar. It is 
the principle of self-government. Yet how, when, 
and where this idea can be applied in the industrial 
world has always been in debate. To the guilds- 
men, however, the application, in general outline at 
least, is simple. Self-government should exist where 
the simplest function is performed in the factory 
and in each department of the factory. All who 
work in the factory are citizens of the industry 
office as well as shop workers, managers as well as 
managed ; the guild is essentially a production organ- 
ization of all the workers, both of the head and of 
the hand, in the industry. Within the plant the 
problem of self-government is primarily to deter- 
mine conditions and methods of work, to select those 
who shall do the less technical executive work and 
those who are to represent the shops in the local dis- 
trict body of the industry. In this district body the 
work of self-government is to secure proper uniform- 
ity in the several shops of the industry, discuss all 
problems that affect the whole local situation, and 
select delegates to the national industrial body. The 
national group or guild in each industry would be 
composed of these delegates from the entire indus- 
try; and in this case self-government involves the 
settling of all those problems which inevitably re- 
quire settlement on a national scale in a world of 



nation-wide industrial units. Concretely, the na- 
tional body of each guild would presumably over- 
see the purchase of the raw material from the State 
or from some other guild ; it would assemble data 
as to costs to give a basis for price determination ; 
it would determine approximately uniform stand- 
ards for the terms of employment of its members; 
it would hold and decide upon the disposition of 
the profits of the industry (profits in the sense of 
surplus left over after all agreed charges, including 
rentals to the State and the drawing-accounts of 
all workers, are met) ; it would study demand and 
help to allocate production, bearing in mind the 
quantity of products needed in the different markets 
of the world; it would carry on technical research 
and trade training. 

But important as these functions are, it is clear 
that today the really incisive statesmanship is re- 
quired in carrying forward coordination among the 
different industries. Which industries are to hare 
priority in getting certain scarce materials and new 
credits ? At what price are the guilds to sell to each 
other? To what point is standardization of parts, 
sizes, and styles to go? These are questions which 
concern all the industries. For their consideration 
the guildsmen advocate a Guild Congress a na- 
tional economic council which through its numer- 
ous standing committees would be the real organiz- 
ing genius of the economic resources of each coun- 
try. As to the interrelation of the economic life of 
the different nations, the guildsmen have had less 
to say; but the war experience with interallied eco- 
nomic agencies and the logical necessity for inter- 
national commodity commissions and other world- 
wide functional groups will undoubtedly lead them 
to the formulation of more definite policies as to 
international industrial relationships. 

Such is the structure of self-government in indus- 
try, conceived in terms of function, in terms of 
needs of consumers, in terms of the personal life of 
all who work. And by the further application of 
this idea, the organization of community life as a 
whole is conceived as embracing two major national 
bodies a parliament occupied with economic and 
industrial affairs, and one concerned as now with 
the civic problems of health, education, recreation, 
protection, and whatever other matters grow out of 
the fact of geographic association. In a word, the 
guildsmen believe that our existing parliamentary 
system would function more effectively if it were 
not continually being confused by issues, interests, 
and overtures from wholly extraneous quarters. 



1919 



THE DIAL 



Let Congress, they would say, continue to deliberate 
upon matters for which the fact of a representation 
of geographical areas fits them to deliberate. But 
let us have done with this confusion where legisla- 
tures also contend with " the railroad vote," " the 
packers' vote," " the steel interests," " the oil 
group," " the insurance clique," and so on. It is not 
so much that these special interests are corrupt as 
that they are misplaced and hence inefficient. The 
place for industrial interests to be voiced and de- 
cisions made is in a body representative of all indus- 
trial interests avowedly meeting together for pur- 
poses of democratic control and operation in the 
public interest. 

This, briefly, is the national guild position on gov- 
ernmental structure. But it still leaves one vital 
function to be carefully examined. What of the 
work now done by the bankers the assembling of 
capital resources, examination into the soundness of 
new ventures and extension of credits to them the 
whole vital task of giving direction to the produc- 
tive energies of a nation? The guildsmen appear 
to have no desire to minimize the reality of this 
service and the necessity for the function. Indeed 
they take the very temperate position that until the 
community finds some equally efficient way to con- 
duct this function, we must continue to pay the 
oankers well for doing it. Only, the guildsmen 
feel that the task of conducting the credit system 
in the public interest is less formidable than it has 
been made to appear; indeed they find intentional 
concealments and obfuscation under the private con- 
trol of credit. Hence they favor the assumption of 
this function by a body to be representative of all 
interests in the community. No task is more criti- 
cal than this one of saying where capital is to be 
invested and for what purpose. The body or bodies 
in whose hands it resides is perhaps more nearly 
sovereign than we care to admit except that even 
here we are in danger of thinking too largely in 
terms of a capitalist system of production. Once 
the direction of production is restored again to the 
actual hea"d and hand workers in the respective in- 
dustries, they could arrange for extensions and 
credits among themseelves without resort to outside 
credits, and thus be in a position to keep any State 
credit agency properly alert to the rights and claims 
of all. In reality, of course, the actual workers in 
the key industries in mining and land and sea 
transportation will always hold the strategically 
powerful positions. The guildsmen have no dis- 
position to deny or minimize this fact. But they do 
change somewhat the complexion of the problem by 
insisting that the guild state implies a new motive 
dominant in industry. Industry is to be a public 



service conducted in close relation to known de- 
mands and needs. No one by virtue of ownership 
is to have the power to say what land or material 
resources shall be used, or the power to exact a 
perennial tribute for their use. The removal of 
private ownership of productive resources does not 
of itself, of course, guarantee development in the 
public interest. But it removes the most acute and 
financially expensive drag upon the economic 
organization; it removes the most egregiously self- 
seeking because entrenched private interest. It 
still remains to relate actual producers to actual 
consumers in a spirit of accommodation ; to get head 
and hand workers to stress the many points at which 
their interests are in harmony. 

Regarding the problem of individual motive for 
work and productiveness, the guild analysis is guilty 
of no over-generous assumptions about human 
nature. It of course denies the proposition that the 
central driving motive in industry has to be private 
profit. But it jumps to no communist proposal of 
equal pay or labor tickets or any other unusual 
device. It contends rather that the industries shall 
be reasonably autonomous as regards determination 
of the rewards to be paid for work; and that, with 
profit to all, an industry's superior efficiency in 
reducing costs might become a factor in this 
determination. In a word, there is to be no 
grandiloquent appeal to idealisms, but rather an in- 
telligent utilization of motives of self-interest 
coupled with those of creative effort and public 
usefulness. This of course must always be so; it 
is one criterion of a sensible social order that it uses 
self-enhancing as well as more directly "social" im- 
pulses. The objection is so frequently urged against 
all plans of social reorganization that they 
presuppose a sentimental and self-effacing altruism, 
that the soundness of the guildsmen's point of view 
needs to be specifically noticed. 

To answer adequately the second question of the 
" why " of national guilds, would require a lengthy 
excursion into present problems. But a statement 
of the significant influences at work to give 
attraction and validity to the idea will show an im- 
posing array of causes. The idea of national guilds 
is in definite reaction against the bureaucratic 
connotations of State Socialism. It is in reaction to 
the "labor as a commodity" theory. It stands firmly 
on the principle of industry as a service to life, as 
one of the fields of human activity which must like 
all the others contribute to the enrichment of 
personality. It is, therefore, in reaction against 
monotony and lack of interest in machine work. It 
is interested in restoring real interest in work, 
fundamental efficiency in the whole economic 






152

organization, and in a proper balance of individual 
freedom and intelligent discipline. The guild 
movement is consequently critical of too much stress 
on craft unionism and is equally at variance with 
the "one big union" idea. However, it aims im- 
mediately to educate and strengthen all organiza- 
tions of the workers in order to utilize them more 
and more as the embryos out of which guilds of head 
and hand workers in each industry can eventually 
develop. 

Taking such a definite and carefully reasoned 
position as to the desirable next steps, the guildsmen 
are naturally cautious in their approval of the 
numerous reconstruction programs. In The Mean- 
ing of National Guilds, a new work by Maurice B. 
Reckitt and C. E. Bechhoffer (Macmillan), perhaps 
the most interesting chapter is the one on The 
Mirage of Reconstruction. It must be read if one 
is to get the full detail of the argument. But it all 
depends, says the conclusion, "upon the spirit in 
which such experiments are made. Encroaching 
control by trade unionism is one thing; capitalist 
devolution by employers quite another." This 
chapter is superior to the others principally be- 



cause it embodies the authors' own opinions. For 
the rest of the book is an exposition of the idea of 
Orage, Hobson, and Cole and while it adds nothing 
to their earlier work it enables the reader rapidly to 
see the different elements in the guild philosophy 
and program. 

I have said that guild ideas are all but unknown 
in this country. This is only true in a sense. It 
is more accurate to say that the name of the idea 
is less familiar than its essence. Already the 
industrial unionists, the railroad brotherhoods, and 
some other scattered groups are advocating national 
industrial organizations in which head and hand 
workers join to manage and operate. The movement 
is not in its present stage so much a reasoned one 
as an almost spontaneous reaction to conditions. 
The book here under consideration deserves wide 
publicity, therefore, to give practical body and vital 
content to ideas already at work. It cannot be 
denied, however, that the supremely effective 
source book in this field is still Mr. G. D. H. Cole's 
admirable Self-Government in Industry.

Mr. Ransome's Facts and Mr. Russell's Fancies 



.USSIA is SOMETHING MORE than the acid test 
of diplomacy: it is the acid test of intelligence. By 
that token a good many American minds, woven 
in the doctrinaire Socialist pattern, have proved 
themselves shoddy. Their progressive surface finish 
no longer conceals the fact that the fabric itself is 
essentially the same stuff out of which National 
Security Leaguers and America First demonstrators 
are made. Must one point this generality with 
names and specifications? Mr. Charles Edward 
Russell's latest arraignment of Soviet Russia comes 
conveniently to hand. (Bolshevism and the United 
States; Bobbs-Merrill.) 

The chief value of Mr. Russell's commentary lies 
not in what it says about Bolshevism but in what it 
reveals about the United States and more particu- 
larly about the mental acumen of certain Socialists 
in the United States who sacrificed their creed to 
their country. For many years Mr. Russell, like 
Mr. W. E. Walling and Mr. John Spargo, had 
pamphleteered for Socialism, and had mastered the 
trick of appraising every political phenomenon in 
terms of certain Socialist phrases and formulae. The 
work was able of its kind, but the chief requirement 
for success was verbal facility rather than fertile 
political thought. So long as the present order of 
society should obtain, so long were Mr. Russell's 



formulae adequate to its criticism and its condemna- 
tion. 

Fortunately the world is not so static as Mr. Rus- 
sell's mentality. At long last, in a distant land, the 
dry bones of Socialist doctrine began to knit them- 
selves, as in the prophet's vision, into the articulate 
forms of living beings. Land was communized; 
credit lifted out of private hands; industries put 
into the trusteeship of the state for the use of the 
workers. Mr. Russell had not imaginatively con- 
sidered that these things could ever come to pass in 
his generation : they were to be brought about gradu- 
ally, decorously, with large rhetorical accompani- 
ments and a minimum of direct action. Still less did 
Mr. Russell ever think that once Socialism began 
to live it would evolve autonomously a scheme of 
its own, quite independent of the static prospectuses 
that he had privately manufactured. Confronted 
by a living organism instead of a logical pattern, 
Mr. Russell sought to conceal his inability to dis- 
sect the first by creating a new abstraction and en- 
dowing it with the qualities of a dramatic myth. 

The result is Bolshevism and the United States. 
Its protagonist is Nicolai Lenin. The myth itself 
the author calls The Great Idea the Dictatorship 
of the Proletariat. Nominally a staid essay in politi- 
cal criticism, the work is really a melodrama, the sort 



1919 



THE DIAL 



of imbecile melodrama which Mr. Russell became 
qualified to write under the tutelage of Mr. Hearst, 
and which he seems to have perfected by a course 
of training under Mr. Thomas Dixon, master of 
the luridly banal. As in most melodramas, the 
villain is the only honest and admirable character 
in the whole play consistently more honest and 
admirable than an author who cannot mention the 
name of Lenin without whispering under his breath, 
"Born Ulianov, you know!" (Just as a person 
might attempt to corroborate the story of Mark 
Twain's being a plagiarist by referring perpetually 
to the fact that he was christened Clemens.) There 
is naturally a good deal of bloodshed in the story, 
for which the villain is responsible in fact, accord- 
ing to Mr. Russell, there is nothing but ignorance, 
incompetence, cruelty, and bloodshed and in the 
end the villain's plans are defeated and his purposes 
are foiled by the rising tide of democracy. 

What Mr. Russell's facts and convictions about 
Russia are worth we shall shortly be able to verify. 
The appalling thing, however, is not the author's 
ignorance of Russia, in which respect most of us are 
at sea in the same boat, but his ignorance of Amer- 
ica. He has the fatal habit of encrusting his mind 
with platitudes to obliterate the vision of realities. 
Thus: " Democracy is the foundation of American 
life." Industrially, Mr. Russell ? " We have lately 
concluded an appallingly expensive war to prevent 
the spread of autocracy." Have we succeeded, Mr. 
Russell? " Bolshevism favors violence, which we ab- 
hor,' and war, whereas we are in the mass committed 
to peace." In the mass, perhaps, Mr. Russell, but 
governmentally what are we actively committed to? 
" It recognizes class and class government, whereas 
we ! have argued that in a republic classes have no 
place." Argued, indeed, Mr. Russell, but have we 
done away with them? The ideal America that 
Mr. Russell holds up against Soviet Russia is beyond 
challenge magnificent except in comparison with 
an equally ideal and non-existent Soviet Russia. But 
the actual America of Security Leagues, espionage 
organizations, race riots, and compulsive militarism 
is not much more profitable to contemplate, for the 
sake of political inspiration, than Russia itself after 
the attempted assassination of Lenin. In order to 
compare two countries you must make sure that your 
examples are on the same plane of reality. 

Let us now correct Mr. Russell's mental distor- 
tions. Arthur Ransome's book, Russia in 1919 
(Huebsch) comes like a breath of cool night air 
at the end of a tedious performance in the stuffy 
auditorium of a garish provincial theater. Mr. Rus- 
sell is a political journalist who writes fairy stories 
about Russia : Mr. Ransome is a teller of fairy stories 



who writes with lucid distinction about affairs which 
are usually within the province of the political jour- 
nalist. Mr. Ransome revisited Russia for the pur- 
pose of rectifying the " tragedy that no Englishman 
properly equipped was in Russia studying the gigan- 
tic experiment which, as a country, we are allowing 
to pass abused but not examined." He had no politi- 
cal theory either to confirm or to abolish. He was 
a reporter and not a propagandist defending a vested 
interest in formulae. All the more convincing, 
therefore, is the fact his impressions in February and 
March confirm those of the New York Globe's 
correspondent a couple of months later. Mr. Ran- 
some had in addition the advantage of an earlier 
background for contrast. He had known the fears, 
hopes, terrors, and anxieties of the November over- 
throw, with its widespread political turmoil. But 
in the Russia he discovered in 1919 the fierceness 
of political contention had abated. The authority 
of the Soviets and their Commissars had been estab- 
lished. The problems they were called upon to deal 
with were not those growing out of political fac- 
tionalism and discontent but those which were due 
to economic disorganization and the necessity for 
waging war against an encirclement of hostile 
armies. In the face of the threatening counter revo- 
lutions of Kolchak and Denikin the civil war be- 
tween parties had all but disappeared. The powers 
of the Revolutionary Tribunal were being volun- 
tarily curbed. At the same time, the war against 
nature had become more bitter. Famine and frost 
punctuate Mr. Ransome's descriptions like the men- 
acing boom of distant cannon. 

Industrially Mr. Ransome found Russia at lowest 
ebb. But the cause of this is not, as Mr. Russell 
glibly assumes, a lack of technical competence on 
the part of Soviet officials. The roots of the diffi- 
culty are deeper. The Soviets fell heir to a State 
that had ceased to be a going concern long before 
the revolution permitted an accurate inventory of its 
antiquated plant and equipment. Now Mr. Veblen 
has taught us to see how completely the state of the 
arts is dependent upon a non-material joint stock of 
knowledges and aptitudes. This stock was badly 
depleted by the weeding out of skilled workers in 
the slaughter-pen of war, and the Allied blockade 
kept it, like the physical equipment, from being re- 
newed from the outside; with the result, Mr. Ran- 
some tells us, that the Soviet Commissaries have 
found it necessary to train the more promising work- 
men for technical positions as they go along. This 
alone would make the necessary restoration difficult; 
but the food situation has made it almost impossible. 
The Russian worker is too weakened by hunger to 
work a full day, whilst the cold of the long winter

makes application to studious tasks futile except for 
short periods of uneven effort. Hence Chicherin's 
desperate offer of peace ; hence the pledge of timber 
and mineral concessions in payment for Russia's 
debts; hence Lenin's willingness to let foreign states 
" build a Chinese wall round each of their coun- 
tries " to ward off invasion by propaganda. But 
above all things the Soviet Commissars seek peace 
and agreement with the Allies. Have their offers 
and pledges been rejected because the Allied Gov- 
ernments fear, under conditions in the slightest de- 
gree favorable, Soviet Russia's success? Viewing Rus- 
sia through Mr. Ransome's eyes it is impossible not 
to get an impression of " that extraordinary vitality 
which obstinately persists in Moscow even in these 
dark days of discomfort, disillusion, pestilence, star- 
vation, and unwanted war." In its worst crisis it 
seems to have more buoyancy than the Allied 
capitals in their securest triumphs. 

In addition to the vitality of the communist pro- 
gram and the Soviet m xhanism, in the face of huge 
dislocations and dilapidi tions, one gets a sense of the 
tremendous economic potentialities which the pres- 
ent regime has barely been permitted to fathom. The 
Council of Public Economy has deliberately fostered 
scientific research. A match without wood or 
paraffin was one of its earliest products. The Com- 
mittee on State Constructions widened the canal 
from the Volga to the Baltic, a feat that the Czar's 
government had dismissed as impracticable. Plans 
have been drawn up to get away from the de- 
pendence upon coal, characteristic of paleotechnic 
industry, and link the chief industrial centers with 
electric power plants situated on the swifter rivers, 
in accordance with the labor-saving, energy-conserv- 
ing neotechnic practice. In the textile industry all 
the big factories have been nationalized, and unity 
of control has done away with the wastes of plant 
duplication, cross-transportation, and competitive 
differentiation of weaves and stuffs. Mr. Ransome 
asked about the fate of the old textile manufactur- 
ers, and was told that, though many had gone 
abroad, many were working in the nationalized fac- 
tories. 

The engineering staff, which mostly struck work at the 
beginning of the Revolution, had almost without exception 
returned, the younger engineers in particular realizing 
the new possibilities opening before the industry, the 
continual need of new improvements, and the immediate 
welcome given to originality of any kind. Apart from 
the question of food, which was bad for everybody, the 
social standard of the workers had risen. Thus one of 
their immediate difficulties was the provision of proper 
houses. The capitalists and manufacturers kept the 
workers in barracks. " Nowadays the men want better 
dwellings, and we mean to give them better. Some have 
moved into the old houses of the owners and manufac- 
turers, but of course there are not enough of these to go 
round, and we have extensive plans in the way of build- 
ing villages and garden cities for the workmen." 



In other words, if we may use a political cliche, 
the Russian Revolution has passed out of its destruc- 
tive phase. From the economist's point of view, 
the constructive process is that which will effect the 
real revolution, and what has led up to it is merely 
a preliminary clearance of the field. It is notorious 
(to use a metaphor from electricity) that the eco- 
nomic and political systems have never been in 
phase. The misfortune of the Soviet Revolution 
was that it brought into existence, somewhat hastily, 
a twentieth century political instrument in the face 
of economic conditions which were gradually slid- 
ing back into a proto-industrial stage. Should the 
present impedance be overcome sufficiently to give 
both economics and politics the same time values, 
one gathers from Mr. Ransome's brief insights into, 
the working of the system that the output of the 
Soviet State, in energies and materials, will be 
higher than that of ( any contemporary civilization, 
and the total result in happiness, once military com- 
pulsions are removed, will at least be equal to that 
enjoyed by favored minorities under capitalism 
today. 

Alone for his glimpses of the social by-products 
of the Revolution Mr. Ransome's volume would be 
of incomparable worth. The individual preparation 
of food in the common kitchen of the National Hotel 
at Moscow; the election of the ex-capitalist as the 
president of his factory, and the difficulty he had 
in keeping his old hands from calling him master; 
the effect of drama offered to an audience compelled 
to endure the torment of cold while it was enacted 
these glimpses are precious. Mr. Ransome saw 
one of Chekhov's dramas of futility, Uncle Vanya. 
He muses: 

A gulf seemed to have been pased ; the life it repre- 
sented had gone forever. People in Russia no longer have 
time for private lives of such a character. Such people 
no longer exist; some of them have. been swept into the 
floodtide of revolution and are working as they never 
hoped to have the chance to work; others, less generous, ' 
have been broken and thrown aside. The revolution has 
been hard on some, and has given new life to others. It 
has swept away that old life so absolutely that, come what 
may, it will be a hundred years at least before anywhere 
in Russia people will be able to be unhappy in that 
particular way again. . . . Was this the old life? I 
thought, as I stepped out into the snow. If so, then thank 
God it has gone! 

If those are the sentiments of an honest and sen- 
sitive man, in the midst of horrible deprivation, 
what would even a traveling salesman say once food 
were plenty again, and houses warm? Would not 
Messrs Russell and Spargo themselves be compelled 
to readjust their values in the presence of such a 

vital demonstration? T ,.

THE DIAL 



A Jazz Critic 



1.N THE LITERARY WORLD there are three familiar 
types of criticism. There is first the type which is 
represented in English scarcely at all (Poe being 
the one possible exception), and of which the finest 
specimens are the Frenchmen, Sainte-Beuve, Taine, 
and Remy de Gourmont. These men, and their 
like, devoted themselves with careful study and 
feline skill to the task of making accurate portraits 
of their heroes and victims. One reads them now for 
the reason that they assimilated so thoroughly the 
books they studied as not to appear to have studied 
them ; rather almost to have written them them- 
selves, or at least to have been present at their writ- 
ing. In a confidential mood they unburden them- 
selves of their secrets ; they give us insight into their 
own personalities, as well as into the personality of 
whatever author they happen to be discussing: they 
re-create literature. This type of criticism is always 
worth reading. 

Another type is familiar in England, and is usu- 
ally readable once if no more. The difficulty with 
it is that it is vague and shallow. The makers of 
such criticism are usually men of slender person- 
ality like Pater, who need the support of great art 
to show off their skill, or coiners of brilliant de- 
tached phrases and judgments, like Coleridge and 
Matthew Arnold. The nibre one reads this type of 
criticism, the more one admires the modesty and 
easy felicity of Charles Lamb. 

The third type of criticism is the German. Anyone 
who is familiar with the intellectual productions of 
Germany before the war, is aware that ( nowhere did 
the unfortunate megalomania of that country dis- 
play itself more clearly than in the field of literary 
criticism. For the last thirty years, German criti- 
cism has been heavy, inflated, pompous, and absurd. 
The German critic immediately assumed the pon- 
tifical robes, and led the unwilling reader through 
serried hosts of books under review, with all the 
airs and graces of a Hohenzollern prince. His aim 
was always to prove the superiority of German 
kultur. 

This method is becoming popular in America, and 
the most recent and brilliant example of it is Mr. 
Untermeyer's book on American poetry. (The 
New Era in American Poetry; Holt.) Needless 
to say, the thesis which this volume attempts to 
support, is that America is just beginning to express 
her own individuality her "genuine Americanism" 
in short in her poetry. This theme Mr. Unter- 
meyer conveniently borrows from Whitman, who 
seems to serve the new generation of American poets 
much as Blake serves those of England, as " a good 



man to take something from." To support Whit- 
man's thesis, Mr. Untermeyer has read all the 
American poetry written, from J. Gordon Coogler 
to Arensburg, from Harriet Monroe to Mina Loy, 
from Lindsay to Wallace Stevens. All, he de- 
clares, wear under their apparent diversity the 
uniform of genuine Americanism; all but a few 
who are strangely omitted, like Edwin Ford Piper, 
Donald Evans, Robert Carlton Brown; and a few 
others, notorious deserters or despicable sharp- 
shooters like Aiken and Pound. 

To refute Mr. Untermeyer, then, it is necessary 
to refute Walt Whitman's thesis of a continent-full 
of democratic bards to follow in his wake. Fortun- 
ately, this is easy. Whitman's work provides its 
own refutation. When Whitman wrote Crossing 
Brooklyn Ferry, or Out of the Cradle Endlessly 
Rocking, or Song of the Open Road or Song of 
Myself, or any one of his finest pieces, he was 
an American poet 'for the reason that he>was most 
completely free from the accidents of time, space, 
and social theory. Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, for 
instance, might almost be called Crossing London 
Bridge ; and so with all the rest. But when Whit- 
man told the Muse to migrate from Greece and 
Ionia, and cast glances of contempt at the obsolete 
feudalism of Europe, he was either longing for an 
inspiration which the American surroundings of his 
day could not furnish, or trying to placate the vulgar 
Philistinism of his time by exalting its opinion into 
a creed. When Whitman came to be an old man, 
he vaguely grasped the fact that Europe had granted 
him the recognition which America had withheld. 
He did not understand what this truly implies, 
namely, that every true poet must necessarily be- 
come the spokesman for his country in other lands. 
Shakespeare, for example, expresses more completely 
the spirit of England than all the power of Eng- 
land's trade, or the weight of England's armies; 
yet in none of Shakespeare's greater plays is the 
scenery, or the characters, exclusively English. 
Whitman's thesis falls to the ground for the reason 
that all great art is outside the bounds of political, 
as it is within the bounds of spiritual nationality. 

So much for Whitman's argument. As for the 
manner in which Mr. Untermeyer has chosen to 
support it, that can be glanced at more briefly. Let 
us take, for example, two chapters devoted to those 
whom he considers leaders of the new movement: 
Mr. James Oppenheim and Miss Amy Lowell. 

Mr. Oppenheim, we are told, expresses the Sem- 
itic strain in American poetry. His conception of 
poetry is that of the Jews: poetry is a message, and 






i S 6 



THE DIAL 



August 23 



art is merely the instrument to make it heard. He 
is a teacher, a preacher, a prophet, and his work 
is compared to the Psalms, to Jeremiah, to the Song 
of Songs, to the Book of Job. And yet Mr. Unter- 
meyer assures us that Mr. Oppenheim's poetry is 
American. Let us turn back to the preface, and 
note the following remark : " Until recently our 
paintings had filled endless galleries with placid ar- 
rangements of Greek nudes, Italian skies, and French 
theories." If it be bad for America to follow a 
French theory in painting, why is it not bad to 
follow a Semitic theory in poetry? Surely one is 
bad as the other, and Mr. Oppenheim's poetry, far 
from being the imposing native structure which Mr. 
Untermeyer says it is, is merely academic balder- 
dash. Further along we are offered this character- 
istic sample of it: 

Who buried Atlantis 

And devoured Egypt? 

Into what jaws has Athens gone? 

Galley slave and Agamemnon, the great king, are 

shoveled under, 
And the girl who combed the hair of Helen is dust with 

her golden mistress. . . . 
Cities of great pride, with their multitudes, 
Have gone down, 
And spring that called out the boy Dante into the streets 

of Florence, 

Silent when Beatrice walked, 
Opens wild roses in the ruins over the dead.... 
The snows where Saga heroes fought 
Melted with those warriors, 
And the desert girls of Arabia are only an echo in our 

brains. 
The same great war; the same great urge; the same 

birth and death. . . . 
Are kisses sweeter than in Carthage, 
Is failure more bitter than on the hill of Gethsemane, 
Has death lost its sting since Rachel? 

It is noteworthy that in all this long, verbose 
catalogue of names Mr. Oppenheim does not men- 
tion a single one that might in any way identify his 
work or interests with America. Had he written 
Montezuma instead of Agamemnon, or the Aztecs 
instead of Egypt, we would at least have known 
that he was aware of America's early existence. 
But neither in these lines, nor in all the three 
hundred and fifty pages of Mr. Untermeyer's book, 
is there one word about the American Indian, or 
about American Indian .Poetry. A strange omis- 
sion. . . . 

Turn to the chapter on Miss Lowell. Here Mr. 
Untermeyer exalts his subject's range, her diversity, 
her temerity in experiment. We are told that she 
is capable of writing in every form from strict met- 
rical stanzas to " futuristic " verslibres, from vers- 
libres to polyphonic prose, from polyphonic prose to 
an interspersing of verslibres and polyphonic a 
style which Mr. Untermeyer does not dignify with 
a title, but which should perhaps be called " poly- 
versphonlibristic". Not a word here about the mis- 



sion of the poet as a social reformer, of which we 
hear so much in the chapters on Oppenheim, Gio- 
vanitti, Wood, and even Vachel Lindsay. On the 
contrary, we are told quietly that Miss Lowell is 
content to be the poet, rather than the prophet. 
Not a word here about the possible influence of Miss 
Lowell's New England ancestry upon the spirit 
of revolt latent in her poetry; though Robert Frost 
who is far less characteristic of New England in 
his personality than Miss Lowell, is highly praised 
for having absorbed New England in his poetry. 
Therefore, Robert Frost is an American poet be- 
cause he writes of New England; Miss Lowell is 
one also because she gives us scientific experiments 
in form. Mr. Oppenheim is one also because he 
holds the Jewish attitude toward art. There is 
but one thing which can be said about such a 
method of criticism. Mr. Untermeyer has omitted 
to mention Sir William Watson as an American 
poet, despite his sonnet on President Wilson; he 
ignores Swinburne as an American poet, despite that 
poet's attitude to Walt Whitman. If Mr. Unter- 
meyer's errors of judgment are thus apparent at the 
outset of his enterprise, what can be said on the 
matter of his minor points, his detail, his style? 
Nothing or rather, everything. In such a welter 
of absurdities one does not know where to begin. 
Let us note, for instance, the space Mr. Untermeyer 
gives to certain poets. Conrad Aiken, for instance, 
is relegated to the minors, and is given seven and a 
half pages of grudging admission and unmeasured 
denunciation, including a severe examination of his 
early verses a proceeding Mr. Untermeyer wisely 
omits in the case of Frost. And at the same time, 
Mr. Untermeyer gives fifteen pages to an apologia 
for John Hall Wheelock, in which that author's 
later sins are forgiven for the sake of two or three 
of his early poems. Or take another point, Mr. 
Untermeyer's total lack of any sense of humor. For 
instance, he solemnly discusses both Mr. Witter 
Bynner and Mr. Bynner's alter ego, " Emmanuel 
Morgan," the leader of the Spectrists, without mak- 
ing the one remark that anyone would expect him 
to make in the circumstances : that Mr. " Morgan " 
was both amusing and readable, whereas Mr. Byn- 
ner is not. 

As for the English in which this book is written, 
it is indescribable. Mr. Untermeyer is not content 
with the vocabulary of Shakespeare and the structure 
of Addison. He introduces new instruments into 
the orchestra, and combines them in a new way. 
But after all, this new art is fairly familiar to our 
ears. - We can hear its counterpart already in the 
performances of any Jazz band.

.\ FORTNIGHTLY 



The Old Order and the New 



IN EUROPE THE EMBRYO LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
threatens with starvation and tempts with food the 
revolutionists who will not obey its mandates. In 
Washington Mr. Wilson makes the acceptance of 
the League a condition precedent to the lowering 
of the cost of living. He promises to do a number 
of things to solve the food problem, but assures the 
people that even though he exerts himself to the 
utmost the situation can not be relieved until the 
Covenant is signed and the direction of the world is 
formally handed over to the corporation formed at 
Paris. It is disheartening but true that there are 
still people in the United States who take Mr. 
Wilson at his word. We might remind the credu- 
lous that the promise about the packers has been 
made by other presidents whose reputation for 
obligations fulfilled was at least as good as Mr. 
Wilson's. But up to date every attempt at reform 
has left the packers and the other trustees of the 
commonwealth as well placed as ever for continu- 
ing their work of plunder. We would like 
to submit further that Mr. Wilson's failure to carry 
on business in the open with the diplomats of Europe 
gives small promise that he will deal openly and 
successfully with Mr. Armour, Mr. Morgan, Mr. 
Schwab and Mr. Rockefeller. As for hoarding: if 
there ever was a time in our history when hoarding 
should have been prevented it was while the world 
war was in progress. It was not prevented then 
and it will not be prevented now. A feint in this 
direction will doubtless be made, but it is incon- 
ceivable that either the President, Congress, the state 
legislatures, or the courts will support the radical 
and necessary remedy of confiscation and public sale. 
That would be going the Bolsheviki and our own 
I.W.W.'s one better, and making functionaries of 
the state liable to imprisonment or deportation. 
Surely there is no one who, out of respect for the 
President's " lofty principle," will take seriously his 
program for the handling of the living-cost issue. 
Some few may even recognize that the cost of living 
is very likely to fall of itself before long. If the 
phenomenal decline in the rate of foreign exchange 
serves to check exports and thereby to increase 
domestic supply and to lower prices, Mr. Wilson 
will be in a position to reap the credit. It will not 
matter that by the sabotage of production and the 
control of distribution the manufacturers and deal- 
ers will be able in a short time to restore prices to 
the level most profitable to them. For the public 
the obvious fact will be that Mr. Wilson presented 
the country with a program and ipso facto prices 
fell. 



THE WADSWORTH BILL, THE EXTREME STEP 
taken by our liberal administration, should disillu- 
sion liberals everywhere. Drawn by the General 
Staff, at the dictation of an alleged " pacifist " sec- 
retary of war, the bill is a complete betrayal of 
liberalism at a moment when scarcely another 
important Government in the world dares take up 
the issue of conscription. Its real objective is not 
military training but a military establishment. This 
it approaches deviously, seductively, behind the rela- 
tively innocent-looking wedge of a three-months' 
training period for youths of nineteen. Although 
the newspaper reports are inadequate to disclose the 
precise interrelation of the details of this proposal, 
nobody who has had any army experience can be 
deceived into thinking that three months of training 
will accomplish more than the initiation and 
enrollment of recruits. Either the two-year reserve 
clause means a two-year liability to training in case 
war should arise, or else the General Staff con- 
templates sending green boys into action as first 
replacements for regulars. Even Secretary Baker 
claims for so short a period little more than that 
it will " secure a careful stock-taking " of the 
physical condition of our youth and that it is not 
too brief to instill " habits of orderliness, coordina- 
tion, and self-care " that is, such habits as salut- 
ing, performing the manual of arms, and rolling 
blankets. The physical effect of such drill is almost 
negligible. In short, the three-months clause is 
sugar on .the pill offered to hostile public opinion. 
The proposal as a whole is unjust in that, besides 
establishing inequality between the new conscripts 
and the regulars they must serve with, it allows 
them no pay above maintenance and five dollars 
monthly " for incidentals," seems to prefer post- 
ponement of training to providing for their depend- 
ents, and carries no recognition of conscientious 
scruples. That it is " stripped of all vocational or 
other educational features " clinches the fact of its 
militaristic intentions. The bill even subsidizes the 
exemption and appeal boards with a provision for 
ten dollars pay daily, so that we may enjoy the 
European blessing of a professional sub-army of 
procurers. And finally, by way of imperialist 
overtone, it extends its benefits to Hawaiians and 
Porto Ricans! 

The military establishment that is the real objec- 
tive of the Wadsworth Bill would multiply our 
old standing army by five, and give us a peace foot- 
ing of 510,000 enlisted men, a war nucleus of 
1,250,000 men for quick mobilization (of whom 
at least half would have had only three months' 



i 5 8

training), a two-year reserve class of 1,200,000 
more, and after that our full man-power resources 
under the Selective Service Act, which the bill 
would establish in immediate force whenever we 
should declare war. Two and a half million 
" soldiers " subject to call before we need invoke 
the draft an imperial picture! In peace times, 
according to the Chief of Staff, this would cost us 
some $900,000,000 annually. Lest that sum stagger 
us a little in view of our war debts, our othei 
taxes, and our present weather eye upon the high 
cost of living, he added that only $94,066,500 of 
it would be demanded by the three-months' train- 
ing course itself, which could be purchased at 
$144.75 per capita, the balance going into the peace- 
time upkeep of the standing army. But observe 
whither you are led by the simple little proposal to 
give an annual three-months outing to nineteen-year- 
old boys! 

IHE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE MILITARY 

Intelligence Service would be maintained for the 
duration of the peace preceded by a few weeks the 
plea for an expanded military establishment. It is by 
the terms of these definite announcements of policy 
that tRe vague promise of disarmament contained in 
the Covenant must be gauged. Political exploita- 
tion and military mastery proceed hand in hand 
under the League: that institution is to bring not 
peace but a sword. Jointly the armies of the League 
will be used against the disaffected populations of 
" backward," communist states; separately they will 
be used against the enemy at home that is, the 
underlying population. The Prussic State was weak 
in verbal idealism. It made the supreme sacrifice 
in order that its spirit, wrapped in the heavy armor 
of pious aspiration, might conquer the governments 
of the world. 

WITH WILSON PLAYING AN AMIABLE ALEX- 
ander I to Clemenceau's Metternich, the first act 
of the drama of counter-revolution has ended in a 
brilliant triumph for the Holy Alliance. The his- 
tory of the pacification of Hungary, now accom- 
plished, is neither very long nor very difficult to 
understand; and it illustrates very admirably the 
manner in which bread and bullets may influence 
the self-determination of a free people. In a speech 
delivered in Paris towards the end of July, Herbert 
C. Hoover, Food Dictator for the Allies, remarked 
that officials of the Relief Commission were main- 
taining and managing some eighteen separate gov- 
ernments eighteen well nourished centers of anti- 
Bolshevism. A few days later (July 26), the Allies 
offered to give Hungary a place in Mr. Hoover's 
bread line on condition that the Soviet government 
be overthrown. Unfortunately the attention of the 
communist officials was centered for the time being 
upon military operations against the most honest of 
their enemies the Roumanians. Meanwhile Cap- 



tain Gregory, an American now functioning as chief 
Allied bread baiter for central Europe, dangled be- 
fore Budapest a most generous offer of food to be 
had at a price. The combined attack of Roumanian 
arms and Allied intrigue was too much for Bela 
Kun; on August 31 his government was overthrown. 
The Associated Press dispatch that announced the 
debacle at Budapest proudly pointed out that Cap- 
tain Gregory should be " credited with a large share 
in the hastening of Bela Kun's retirement." In 
the face of a feeble and obviously insincere protest 
from the Supreme Council at Paris, the Roumanian 
army now overran Hungary, occupied the capital, 
and created conditions that made easy the strangula- 
tion of the new bourgeois-Socialist government, 
the return of the emigres, and the complete work- 
ing out of the counter-revolution. With the 
Supreme Council still uttering stage thunders against 
Roumania, Archduke Joseph, " the most popular 
member of the Hapsburg family," dumped the ad 
interim cabinet into the discard and became Regent 
of Hungary. The sincerity of the Allied promises 
to the first anti-communist government may be 
judged from the fact that on the day of the Haps- 
burg coup d'etat the members of Entente mission 
conferred with the Archduke, reached " a full agree- 
ment " with him on various matters, and ended by 
delegating governmental authority to this new 
Dictator. 

1 HE NATURE OF AMERICAN ACTIVITIES IN 

Hungary is easily understood when published facts 
are once gathered together. Information relative 
to counter-revolutionary operations in Finland and 
Russia is not so easily obtainable; an interview pub- 
lished in the Soumen Sosialidemokraatti, a Finnish 
newspaper, may therefore be regarded as " a piece 
of preciosity." The speakers are, first, a Finnish 
newspaper reporter; second, Magnus Swenson, 
sometime of Madison, Wisconsin, more recently 
Inter-Allied Food Dictator for Scandinavia and 
Finland. To quote: 

" Is it true," I [the reporter] asked, " that our getting 
foodstuffs depends to some extent on the political system 
of our country." 

" Yes. You know, of course, the wish of America that 
your country should have a democratic system and that 
the composition of the government should answer the party 
divisions in the newly elected Diet. I know that condi- 
tions here are not quite satisfactory as yet, but I am sure 
that everything will be all right very soon. I feel sure 
that the people of Finland under all circmstances are 
able to take care of themselves. But we have another dan- 
ger before us. America and the Entente powers regard the 
Bolsheviki of Russia as enemies of mankind. The position 
of your country would become very difficult, and your 
relations to the Entente countries would perhaps become 
impossible, if the Bolsheviki should get into power here." 

" Do you believe that Finland would be permitted even 
formally to make peace with the Russian Soviet Republic? " 

" I am no politician and I cannot give you any definite 
answer about that. Nevertheless, I believe, that the En- 
tente powers would not approve of such a peace at this 
time. In regard to the food problem, which is the only 
question within my jurisdiction, I believe it would not be 



1919 



THE DIAL 



1 59 



as easy to arrange for food relief in case you would start 
negotiations with the present Russian Government." 

I understand that this a very delicate point. . . . 
The problem is by no means of a purely humantarian 
character the delivery of the Finnish 1 people from star- 
vation. Rather the object is to make Finland's policies com- 
pletely dependent on the policy of the western imperialists, 
and to compel the Finnish people to remain in a state 
of war with the Russian Soviet Republic. 



IF ANY STIMULUS WAS NEEDED TO STIFFEN THE 

Bolshevist resistance to the attacks of the Allied 
imperialist combine, the new developments in 
Hungary have supplied this stimulus. Seen for 
what it is, the Betrayal of Budapest will bring to 
the Russian people, and to the enemies of imperial- 
ism everywhere, not the valor of desperation but 
courage confident of victory. At Budapest the 
Allies showed their hand. What they would do 
only too gladly by force alone, they are now com- 
pelled to do in part by trickery. Diplomacy and 
dollars still move at the command of governments 
that can no longer trust their troops. The armies 
of Western Europe and America are being called 
home by the will of the people; but the work of 
counter-revolution is being carried on, not now with 
the people's manhood, but still with the people's 
money. Has the time not come then to put to the 
people of America a simple question : " You have 
bought the bonds of your government; you have 
pledged generous aid to starving humanity in 
Europe; but do you want your money used to 
finance a food relief scheme that is doing the revolt- 
ing work you will not let your army do ? " 

1HE PRESS HAILS WITH JOY THE FAILURE OF THE 

proletariat in Europe to get action on Russia and 
to get it by the direct method. If the facts in the 
situation were followed with a desire to unearth 
the truth it is possible that a fair conclusion would 
be that the direct action policy of the workers has 
already accomplished as much to prevent the extenr 
sion of intervention in Russian affairs as diplomacy 
in Paris has accomplished in the defeat of Soviet 
government. A final decision has not been reached 
in England as to whether the workers will or will 
not strike against the government's Russian policy. 
The matter is to be referred to a trade union con- 
gress. On July 31 it was reported from London 
that the Government was to proceed immediately 
with the withdrawal of the British forces from 
North Russia. Several days earlier Mr. Asquith 
had been moved to say: 

I regard with bewilderment and apprehension the part 
this country is playing in Russia. The country wants a 
clearer definition than it has yet been given of what are 
our commitments, definite and prospective. I surely hope 
that the attempt to commit us further in Russia will be 
successfully resisted. The future government of Russia 
is a matter to be settled by the Russian people and no one 
else, i The economic condition of the world and of our 
country was never more menacing. 



We hope that the trade unionists in casting their 
vote will accept these remarks of Mr. Asquith as a 
challenge to them to block the policy of the Coalition 
Government, announced by Mr. Chamberlain, " to 
continue economic aid and a powerful contribution 
of munitions to Denikin." What these British 
workers will still do in regard to Russia is an open 
question. But what the Italian workers have 
accomplished in forcing action upon their govern- 
ment is a matter of history. All that was needed 
there to bring the government to terms was the 
adoption of a resolution to strike. We take this 
opportunity to reprint the resolution of the Italian 
seamen, as it has received scant notice. It is one 
of the most striking proofs we have that there is in 
Europe a labor group with international sympathies. 
It runs: 

All the crews of Italian steamers are disposed to go to 
prison or be sent to the bottom of the harbor with their 
steamers rather than allow themselves to contribute to the 
defeat of the Russian people's revolution. We are con- 
vinced that such a defeat would mean the defeat of labor 
everywhere. We invite all other labor organizations, 
especially seamen, to boycott all steamers chartered by 
international capitalism against the Workers'International 
which is now massing its Red varnguards on the battle- 
fields of revolutionary Russia. 



HE WAR WENT TOO FAR MILLIONS OF MEN 

and billions of dollars too far. The Supreme 
Council admits it when it goes about rebuilding 
what the war pulled down at such a heavy cost 
in blood and treasure. A monopoly of ruling-class 
privileges was the reward expected by the victors; 
actually they have fallen heir to a revolution that 
threatens the destruction of the very system of 
privilege. It is the fear of this universal cataclysm 
that sets the Supreme Council seeking allies among 
its bitterest enemies of a year ago. With the defeat 
of Germany the fears and animosities that so 
recently divided Europe into two rival political sys- 
tems lost most of their significance; since that time 
the fear of the social revolution has tended more 
and more to replace the old national and dynastic 
rivalries. The Treaty is the product of the 
nationalistic system that gave the conqueror the 
right to grind his defeated rival into the dust. But 
the counter-revolutionary activities of the Allied 
powers are of a different order; they belong not to 
the war of nations but to the class struggle that 
divides Europe horizontally and gives the lie to 
nationalism at the very moment when the war has 
brought it to the height of its development. Man- 
nerheim of Finland, Kolchak of Russia, and Joseph 
of Austria have profited in turn by the new diplo- 
macy that joins dollars and dynasties in the defense 
of privilege. With these alliances of desperation 
threatened by the rising tide of revolt, how long 
will it be before the Supreme Council is compelled 
to acknowledge that from the point of view of the 
ruling class the war that started the revolution was 
a mistake?

Casual Comment 

iHE WAR AND ITS OUTCOME HAVE THROWN THE 

world into a welter of political thought and action, 
inevitably at the expense of interest in the creative 
arts. Speculation has seized upon this fact; by 
consequence each day adds a chapter to the discus- 
sion of what-is-most-worth-while-anyhow. One of 
these commentaries a foundling editorial sheltered 
-by a respectable weekly finds good counsel in the 
past. Look, says the writer, at the Revolutionary 
Age of a hundred years ago. Where is Marat, 
killed miserably in his bath, and Charlotte Corday, 
silent now as her great bloodguilty victim. Where 
is the giant Danton, and Robespierre, Highpriest 
of Reason, burned in his own sacrificial fires. . 
Among them all there is no voice speaking in an 
age that yet hears Schiller and Goethe, Bach, who 
came before, and Chopin, who came after. These 
men lived somewhat apart from the hot passions 
of their time; and as they stood, so their work 
stands today " above the battle." Without deny- 
ing the fact that individual achievement in the arts 
is kindlier treated by the years than is any great 
accomplishment in politics, we may yet dispute the 
frequent corollary that in the arts is all perma- 
nence and perfection, in politics nothing but tempo- 
ral futility. It is easy and inane to confuse the 
everlasting with the ever visible. Art builds up, 
toward the sun. A painting or a poem or a sym- 
phony that achieves greatness at the same time 
achieves individuality towering above temporal 
horizons. The great works that follow after must 
build anew for themselves; behind t;hem stand 
always the monuments of the Masters. 

But the type of thought that organizes and moves 
humanity in its daily tasks must build foundation- 
wise, flat upon the earth. To move the masses of 
men, thought must be not too lofty and individual- 
istic, but simple and capable of being readily under- 
stood by the common run of humanity. Among 
prophets, one speaks too loftily, and has no audience 
but oblivion; another turns to brutalities, leads the 
mob, is trampled by the madness he sets loose; a 
third talks simply of things that most men see the 
good of, and perhaps arouses action a continent 
wide. Oblivion takes them all the dreamer, the 
demagogue, the leader of men. It often takes the 
last sooner than the" others : reforms once achieved 
become a commonplace; and the reformer, because 
of the practical turn that made leadership possible, 
too often turns conservator of what has been won ; 
the political revolutionist may be the bitterest enemy 
of the communist, who nevertheless builds upon the 
political foundations and eventually hides them alto- 
gether from view. Thus in the group affairs of 
humanity what is best done is soonest out of date. 
The political past shows no long monumented corri- 
dors of beauty. The present is the mob-trampled 
foundation of the future. What was, is forgotten; 
what is, is not enough ; what is to be will hide the 
best achievements of the present. 



1 HE WAY MAPS ARE USED IN CURRENT WAR- 

books and histories is not calculated to increase 
respect for the geographic disciplines. Their func- 
tion is formal and decorative. They run concur- 
rently with the text and now and again break into 
the solid blackness of the printed page; but at best 
their success is typographic rather than topographic, 
artistic and not scientific. Even from the point ot 
view of simple draughtsmanship the mean specimen 
is an affront to the one or two rules of cartography 
which every writer who must handle geographic 
data should be acquainted with. First, as to posi- 
tion. It is unpardonable, in the eyes of most 
geographers, to exhibit a section of territory with- 
out noting its latitude and longitude; for it is by 
these notations that any particular map may be re- 
ferred to with convenience on any other map. Most 
writers have a heavy score against them on this 
count. The second requirement is intelligibility. 
Von Humboldt, we believe, laid down the maxim 
that a map should tell but a single story and do so 
selectively, without confusing the reader's percep- 
tions with a number of other considerations. Thus 
if the author is depicting the lineup of the opposing 
forces in an engagement involving the capture and 
occupation of three towns and five villages, the best 
practice is to show these critical centers alone, with- 
out respect to the fifty other places which happen to 
be set down on the official maps of the region. 
Especially should this practice be followed when 
the map deals with a short sector of conflict, and is 
reduced to the scale of a half-inch equals two miles. 
To copy the details of the full scale military map 
is to court illegibility and marry confusion. A map 
to be studied by an experienced student may be pretty 
heavily studded with diverse kinds of data; but a 
map that accompanies a text is meant to be read like 
the text, and it is only by being drawn with a single 
eye to the point to be illuminated that it can become 
anything better than a decoration. Most authors 
however flounder helplessly in the hands of some un- 
interested map publisher or draughtsman, ignorant 
of the possibilities they fail to exploit. What geo- 
graphic training might give them, a glance at Mr. 
H. J. Mackinders' Democratic Ideals and Reality 
(Holt) would show. His rough but suggestive 
maps are worth a whole atlas of more literal illus- 
trations whose accuracy is no recompense for their 
ineffectualness and sterility. 

THE TRICK OF TOYING WITH AN IDEA UNTIL IT 

suggests another, and then of toying with that until 
it suggests a third, and so on indefinitely, is by no 
means the exclusive possession of the after dinner 
speaker. There are any number of essayists who let 
this indolent device serve them as the basis of tech- 
nique, enabling them to be prolific as well es 
leisurely, although we recall no more faithful ex- 
ponent of it than F. W. Boreham, who lives in Aus- 
tralia, and from that vantage spot strews his ideas 
in fragrant bunches upon the face of the earth. Six 



1919 



THE DIAL 



161 



of these bunches have now been imported by the 
Abingdon Press (New York), bearing titles as fol- 
lows: The Golden Milestone, The Silver Shadow, 
The Luggage of Life, Mountains in the Mist, 
Mushrooms on the Moor, Faces in the Fire. 

The boyish pastime of skipping stones across the 
surface of a pond furnishes a true parallel for the 
method of these sketches. Mr. Boreham may or 
may not have indulged this sport in youth, but there 
can be no question but that he has absorbed its tech- 
nique to guide what he chooses to term a " truant 
pen " through the mazes of " its inordinate gar- 
rulity." The essays present themselves as exercises 
in seeing how many orderly mental " skips" can be 
secured from one throw across the placid pond of a 
conventional mind. Remarkable results may be ob- 
tained thus by simply drawing each sentence out of 
the tail of its predecessor, after the manner of the 
orator who counts upon interlocking anecdotes to 
conceal a mental blank. Not infrequently the final 
word of a sentence may be made by the propeling 
force of an entire new paragraph, and so by easy 
stages an entire essay evolved. 

As a natural corollary of his method, the author 
revels in diversity. There is scarcely an imaginable 
conventional theme which does not bob up on one or 
another of the 1650 odd pages. " Have I written 
on earthquakes, weddings, sermons, and similar vol- 
canic disturbances? I think not," he remarks at 
the beginning of one essay and then hastens to re- 
pair the omission. That, undoubtedly, is why there 
are six of these volumes. 



L OETRY WRITTEN. DURING THE WAR IS TINGED 

with the reflected light of the conflict even when it 
is not wrapped in the martial colors. War's emo- 
tional reactions linger like an afterglow when the 
sun itself has departed. From Forward March 
(Lane) to Rediscoveries (Cornhill) one runs the 
martial gauntlet, now thwacked by the club of patri- 
otism or again barbed by the spear of satire. 

In Rediscoveries Richard D. Ware has the bear- 
ing of the worldly and professional sarcast, and by 
means of a sardonic inflection and the bizarre empha- 
sis that the free verse arrangement can be made to 
give, he makes a fairly sharp impression. The net 
effect, however, is weakened by lack of originality 
and a tendency toward safety in his choice of topics. 
His targets are the too common butts of reprobation 
the suffragette, the pacifist, the Germans cruci- 
fied with platitudes. Such poetry is as weak as the 
mood that provokes it. 

Forward March by Angela Morgan testifies to a 
liberated spirit. Her readiness knows few nega- 
tions, no distinctions, never a doubt. The wells o^ 
her facility are unsealed by such an embracing 
confidence in the universe as is not everyday in 
this time of limited capacities. She is more con- 
vinced than anybody of God and the people, ser- 
mons in stones, and good in everything recon- 
structive. 



In Mr. Hagedorn's Hymn of Free Peoples 
Triumphant (Macmillan) the note of deliverance, 
the depth, the panorama, the vibrations of solem- 
nity, the profound assurance, the sense of menace, 
the zeal, all recall Old Testament Hosannahs. Yet 
despite these studious echoes and despite the greater 
fact that it draws breath and is dramatic in its own 
right, it is a closet hymn, to be read by the free 
peoples and not chanted perhaps the free peoples of 
today do not know how to chant. This constructed 
language could not be expected to have the wild 
energy that burst abroad in the days of Elijah ; there 
has been no such energy in modern times except per- 
haps Carlyle's. The war itself could not unleash 
that which the poet had not originally stored up. 

The brevity, the qualities, the finish of War 
Poems (Yale University Press) come unexpectedly 
from a book of war verse. Their maturity is only 
slightly involved in chauvinism and jingles. Their 
preoccupations are inward and with the thought of 
fortitude and losing, with the reverberations of war 
in the heart, with the inevitable but never quite 
trite reflections on mortality that war brings to 
mind. They show several degrees of approach to 
finality: they range in authorship from John Finley 
to John Masefield and Robert Frost, whose Not 
to Keep is the ranking piece of the volume. Prized 
and studied simplicity of idiom and quiet maturity 
of mood are the claims of this book to recommen- 
dation. 

Of a different mood, more close to the realism 
of the fighting man, is En Repos and Elsewhere 
Over There by Lansing Warren and Robert A. 
Donaldson (Houghton MifHin). Here the routine 
of death and destruction is handled in a humorous 
and soldierly manner perhaps the only manner that 
could bring a fighting man sane through war. In 
general the humor is that of the jolly undertakers 
but for the authors, as for the safe civilian, "neither 
routine /K>r good humor can be stretched to cover the 
wide panorama of war seen at a distance. In the 
words of the most aspiring phrase in the volume, the 
struggle demands "an Iliad of the Western World." 
If En Repos does not give us the desired Iliad, it is 
yet a book worth looking casually into.

AMERICAN MONEY AND KOLCHAK 
PROPAGANDA 

SIR: While the Lusk Committee and various 
" investigators " are excited to the point of hysteria 
because certain groups friendly to the Soviet Gov- 
ernment are spending money in this country for 
the purpose of placing facts before the American 
people, no one seems to have inquired as to the 
enormous expenditures made by the Kolchak 
propagandists. 

Where has Mr. A. Sack of the Russian Infor- 
mation Bureau obtained the money for his exten- 
sive campaign of misinformation? Full-page ad- 
vertisements have appeared in various newspapers, 
and the Kolchak weekly, Struggling Russia, has 
been published necessarily at great expense. Is it 
true that the money being used in this propaganda 
is a portion of that granted by the American Gov- 
ernment to the Russian Government out of the 
proceeds of the sale of war bonds? 

In 1917 there was granted by the United States 
to Russia a credit of about $300,000,000. At the 
time of Kerensky's fall about $135,000,000 of this 
loan had been expended. What has become of the 
remainder? Was it left in the hands of Mr. 
Bakhmeteff, Kerensky's Ambassador to the United 
States? And is not the Russian Information 
Bureau a branch of that Embassy and are not its 
officials still on the Embassy pay-roll? If this be 
the case, is not American money being used in 
America for propaganda on behalf of the Kolchak 
regime ?

INDIAN MELODISTS AND MR. UNTERMEYER 

SIR : There are several ways of reviewing books ; 
one may be captious, laudatory, or dispassionate. 
The critic should at least be reasonably fair. Mr. 
Untermeyer in his review of The Path on the Rain- 
bow, the Book of Indian Poems (Boni & Live- 
right), has made a rather serious indictment of its 
editor, one which compels that individual to emerge 
in self-defense from what the critic evidently con- 
siders a purely nebulous state, and take up arms 
in his own behalf. 

The case against the book consists of the follow- 
ing counts: that a so-called Indian croon alleged 
to have been translated by Carl Sandburg is, in 
reality, not Indian in origin at all; therefore, there 
is a strong likelihood of other inclusions being of 
questionable authenticity. To the first part of this 
count I plead guilty, the designation " translation " 
being a typographical error, resulting from the fact 
that the Table of Contents was the only part of the 
book which it was impossible for me to read in 
proof. Since the poem was reprinted by permission 
from Poetry Magazines where its authorship would 



be known to readers of that magazine, my good faith 
in the matter need not, I trust, be seriously ques- 
tioned. An investigation of the sources of the 
book will show that I have made every effort to dis- 
tinguish between genuine literal translations and 
those poems which I have grouped under the head 
of Interpretations wherein the approach is through 
a medium not Indian; and there is not one of 
the aforesaid translators who is not an accepted 
authority on ethnology. 

To the second count, that it was unwise to in- 
clude in the Interpretations the " sentimental jin- 
gling " of the poems by Miss Johnson (Tekashion- 
weke), it must be confessed that it was against the 
judgment of the editor and only in deference to the 
wishes of the publishers, who argued the great 
popularity of that poet's works in Canada and else- 
where that inclusion was made. The poems in 
question show how far the Indian poet strays from 
her own primitive tribal songs, when attempting the 
White Man's mode. But then one must concede 
something to one's publishers ! 

There remain the questions of footnotes and of 
the value of some of the songs themselves. Mr. 
Untermeyer seems to be bewildered by the absence 
of notes to such a song as this: 

Maple sugar 

is the only thing 
that satisfies me. 

It is so unintelligible, inconsequential . . . 
dressed in its absurd pretentious vers libre make-up ! 
But when Mrs. Austin explains the primitive back- 
ground, the thing at once becomes illuminating and 
satisfying. " Ten thousand American boys in a 
foreign land singing Home Sweet Home is a very 
moving thing, and twice ten Indians at the ragged 
end of Winter, when the food goes stale and their 
very garments smell of wood smoke, singing their 
maple sugar song might sing a great deal of poetry 
into it poetry of rising sap, clean snow water, 
calling partridge, and the friendly click of brass 
bowls and birch-bark sap buckets." Mr. Unter- 
meyer would like to have all the poems similarly 
bulwarked by picturesque explanatory matter. 

You see, the real secret of the poetry of the above 
song is, that the Indians are hungry, hungry for 
maple sugar. To critics who have lost their primi- 
tive gusto for maple sugar that sensation may well 
be a riddle. Well, we might take another song: 

Oh 

I am thinking 
Oh 

I am thinking 

I have found 

my lover 
Oh 

I think it is so. 

We might add the proper footnotes to it such as: 
" This song represents the yearning of the Indian 
maiden for her lover. , Such songs are sung in the 
evening when the herons are flying across the wild 
rice. It was said that in the old davs all the love 



igig

songs were associated with a man's qualifications 
to wed, this being determined by his success in war 
or in the buffalo hunt. The method of courtship 
was as follows:" and so forth. All this may make 
Mr. Untermeyer happy and contented, but person- 
ally I have cherished a passionate distaste for foot- 
notes ever since that wretched academic period when, 
for every line of poetry or drama read, one had to 
plough through a jungle of notes at the bottom of 
the pagCj or at the back of the book. It seemed 
to me then that there was only one creature more 
horrible and contemptible than the teacher who 
sandbagged poetry, and that was the editor who 
crucified it with unnecessary notes.

GEORGE W. CRONYN. 



IMAGISM : ORIGINAL AND ABORIGINAL 

SIR: Your clipping of Mr. Untermeyer's 
answer to my criticism on his review of The Path 
on the Rainbow (Boni & Liveright) seems to con- 
done my again insisting that even in his defense of 
himself Mr. Untermeyer betrays that tendency to 
begin his thinking at Greenwich Village or there- 
about, which seems to me at present the most re- 
grettable tendency in American literary criticism. 

Mr. Untermeyer speaks of the Indian verse as a 
" crude reduction to Imagist verse form." What I 
tried to say before and Mr. Untermeyer still misses, 
is that Indian verse form is Imagism. It was 
not " reduced " to that form, it was made that 
way originally. In its original form the Maple 
Sugar song reads exactly as it is written in the 
Anthology. It is a three phrase song literally 
translated by one of the most careful students of 
Indian poetry, Frances Dinsmore. The Indian 
words being longer, fill out the measure of the 
rhythm, and in case the words do not quite fill out 
the measure, the Indian poet, contrary to our mod- 
ern use, does not add more words, but fills in the 
measure with meaningless musical syllables. 

Miss Dinsmore's translations are ethnic rather 
than ptfetic. I do not happen to know the Chip- 
pewa language in which the song was originally 
written, but I do know the genius of Indian 
languages in general. They are holophrastic, that 
is to say, one word is actually made up of the es- 
sential syllables of a whole descriptive phrase. For 
example, there is an Algonquian word which an 
ethnologist would translate accurately as Dawn. 
But a poet would translate it no less accurately 
and more adequately and more Indianly as " Hither- 
whiteness-comes-walking." In the same manner the 
word which Miss Dinsmore translates as maple 
sugar, might actually have been something like this 
" the sweet-white-downdripping-blood-of-the-maple- 
tree " or " the-sweetness-which-I-draw-from-the- 
maple-with-my-flint-knife." 

Now my contention has been from the begin- 
ning that unless Mr. Untermeyer knew something 
of the genius of the aboriginal Indian language, un- 



less he knew something of Imagism besides what it 
looks like on paper, he had no right to review this 
book. Certainly he had no right to condemn it 
because it does not come within his notion of what 
poetry is in New York today. I admit the errors 
in editing the book, and particularly I admit my own 
liability to err in a subject so broad and so little 
studied, but I deny Mr. Untermeyer's right to ob- 
ject to the inclusion of particular poems in the book 
because they do not please him. Many Indian 
poems are banal, many are " jinglingly sentimental " 
as he describes Miss Johnson's Paddle Song, albeit 
Miss Johnson is, I understand, the only contribut- 
ing translator with Indian blood, and probably 
closer than any of us to the genuine poetic values 
of what she translates. 

Mr. Untermeyer must forgive me if he, as the 
more conspicuous figure, has drawn my fire. He 
is not the only poet who has reviewed the book under 
the impression that Imagism was invented in West 
Twenty-Third Street and perfected in Chicago.

Notes on New Books 

SAMURAI TRAILS. By Lucian Swift Kirtland. 

300 pages. Do ran. 

It cannot be insisted too strongly that peace will 
never be kept between two countries who do not un- 
derstand each other. Agitators still talk of a war 
between the United States and Japan. There is no 
reason for anything so foolish or fatal, except ignor- 
ance ignorance of each other's methods of thinking 
and living. The value of a man like Lafcadio Hearn 
is immeasurable; such people pry beneath masks, ex- 
plain the spiritual causes of customs, and expose the 
fundamental soil of humanity, which is the .only 
ground on which a peaceful world can be established. 
Civilization, after all, is nothing but the sympa- 
thetic understanding of one's neighbor. 

Lucian Swift Kirtland likes Japan because it is 
human and full of meaning. The curious customs 
he sees are an intellectual stimulus, a puzzle whose 
solution concerns the world. He possesses that most 
valuable accessory of common-sense, a sense of 
humor humor which transmutes an irritating inci- 
dent into a thing to be remembered with pleasure. 
He has the leisure and means to wander as he wishes, 
the physical strength and the adaptive personality to 
go where he wishes, and the taste for choosing places 
worth knowing. In 1914, he and a companion de- 
cided to wander about Japan. Later a Japanese 
of the samurai caste joined them. The fourth mem- 
ber of the party was a diabolical bicycle of native 
make, that almost ranks with Stevenson's Modestine. 
They wisely decided to avoid big cities, tourist 
haunts, and railroads; and the route they eventually 
selected was the abandoned trail upon which, be- 
fore the upheaval of 1868, the samurai came from 
Yiddo to Nakescendo Nakescendo, whose beauty 
was so cherished that its ancient adorers "did not 
allow their artists to paint it, nor their poets to sing 
of it to the world," and which consequently is now 
unknown. 

Still more valuable is his easy but concentrated 
analysis of Japanese conventions and morals. Japan 
is a land of tradition ; the centuries have formalized 
all life into system, just as their artists have forma- 
lized the rhythms of waves or clouds and the pat- 
terns of trees or rocks into unreal symbols. All 
these things must be patiently explained to the Occi- 
dent. Nitobe's Bushido and Okakura's Book of 
Tea have done much ; nevertheless there are ex- 
tremely few Americans who could live in a Japan- 
ese household for a day without breaking at least 
half the rules of etiquette. The frightful matter 
of Japanese nakedness (or should one write 
"nudity?") has caused as much consternation as was 
caused three centuries ago in our own land, when 
the Jesuit priests tried to teach the American In- 
dian what a shameful thing self-exposure was. 
They succeeded so illy, that many were tempted into 
the heresy that the Indian could not have inherited 
the sin of Adam ! The Japanese seem equally unim- 



pressionable. Kirtland solves the question to his 
satisfaction in a couple of pages, filled with respect 
for the belief of others, and a knowledge of the 
philosophy of clothes. 

The Japanese know America pretty well ; but we 
have been far too self-concerned to make a similar 
effort. Those who read this book will find it amus- 
ing; but it is much more it is a thoughtful and 
sincere commentary on Japan, excellently told, a 
bridge between two proud nations. 

AMERICAN CHARITIES. By Amos G. Warner. 
Revised by Mary Roberts Coolidge. 541 pages. 
Crowell. 

Amos Warner was in his day, a half a century 
ago, almost as much of a pioneer as the lamented 
Carleton Parker of our generation. The two men 
had much in common in their connection with the 
academic and industrial life of the Pacific coast, in 
their important but unfinished work, and their un- 
timely death. It is a, happy thought that Carleton 
Parker, a generation hence, may seem as old fash- 
ioned as Amos Warner does today, even decked out 
in shreds and patches of our contemporary costume. 
Mrs. Coolidge, in attempting another revision of 
" American Charities," has set herself a well nigh 
impossible task. The world has moved too fast 
and too far since the revision of this book in 1908 
and is in too transitional a stage just now for this 
hour to seem the one appointed for such a formula- 
tion. The book is hardly of sufficient contemporary 
interest for the general reader, but for the social 
worker it is instructive and entertaining and some- 
what bewildering. To a reader capable of such 
discriminations, these variations on the theme of 
Warner appear to be written, as it were; in three 
keys at once, if such a figure is permissible. First, 
we distinguish the original basis of the Warner of 
the early nineties, discoursing on Pauperism, Insti- 
tutional Care, and Charity Organization Principles, 
then the note of the revisor's interpolation of 1908, 
harping on the then new and all important science 
of Eugenics; finally the discordant tones so in- 
harmonious with the old systematizations of the 
developing sciences of Mental and Social Hygiene, 
. Health Insurance, and the Improvement of Indus- 
trial Conditions. On the whole, the point of view 
Seems somewhat limited and the emphasis already 
somewhat obsolete on old and dreary problems of 
institutional administration and pauperism, unillum- 
inated by the interpretation of modern psychology 
and psychiatry, with their emphasis on the indi- 
vidual. One puts down this book with the sense 
that admirable as were the motives of the revisor 
in devotedly attempting to perpetuate the memory of 
a pioneer in social work, the net result falls short 
of justice to a man who was a progressive spirit in 
his time and who if he had lived today would have 
written a book radically different from anything 
that can be made out of his work of a generation ago.

THE FORGOTTEN MAN AND OTHER ESSAYS. 
By W. G. Sumner. 557 pages. Yale Univer- 
sity Press. 

This is the last of four volumes in which Prof. 
A. G. Keller has collected the essays of his late 
colleague, William Graham Sumner. The present 
volume gives chiefly the earlier essays; but they are 
marked with the vigorous realism which made Sum- 
ner's books outstanding contributions to the litera- 
ture of sociology in America. The title essay argues 
that most schemes for social reform amount to noth- 
ing more than putting into the pocket of a more or 
less thriftless and shiftless person part of the earn- 
ings of the inconspicuous person who shifts and 
thrifts for himself; social betterment, Sumner urges, 
will consist rather in the discouragement of in- 
competence than in the protection of its exemplers. 
The essay bears the stamp of its time (1883), when 
it was more forgivable than it is now to base one's 
economics on the supposition that every man is the 
sole arbiter of his fate, arid captain of his soul. An 
article on The Philosophy of Strikes (1883) points 
out how easily raises in wages can be nullified 
through corporation control of prices. In general 
the book is a valuable aid to old people who wish 
to make as intelligent a defense as may be of the 
devil-take-the-hindmost scheme of industry in the 
United States of thirty years ago. 

THE GOOD MAN AND THE GOOD. By Mary 
Whiton Calkins. 210 pages. Macmillan. 

A time like the present, when antagonistic polit- 
ical and social ideals contend for mastery, offers an 
unusual opportunity to the moral philosopher. And 
Miss Calkins has written not only a timely and 
stimulating book, but one which, despite its brev- 
ity, serves to introduce the reader to its chief con- 
cepts, problems, and rival theories of ethical discus- 
sion. Her own view, although totally free from 
sentimentalism, is expressive of strong social con- 
sciousness, sympathy and imagination. And while 
the discussion is conducted on an intellectual plane, 
this is done without the sacrifice of clearness or 'com- 
mon sense. 

To the casual reader there are some things about 
the book which invite irony : her illustrations for one 
thing. Her young women are apt to play harps, her 
young men to pull the stroke oar at college, her chil- 
dren to play with Great Danes, her adults to work 
on manuscripts, make a million dollars, or contribute 
to campaign funds. There are golden mornings in 
California, tramps in the Rockies, seasons at New- 
port, trips abroad, surf bathing, operas, auto-trips, 
and so on. In a word, its stage setting suggests op- 
portunity, wealth, comfort anything but squalor 
and struggle or even the moral conflicts of men and 
women as they come. One is tempted to change the 
title of the book to Ethics for Ladies of Leisure. 

To take such liberty, however, would not only be 
ungracious but unfair. For despite this idiosyncrasy 



of the author the book is a serious, straightforward 
presentation of a well-considered ethical standpoint, 
by a woman who has evidently experienced deeply, 
read widely, and thought with power and unusual 
freedom from bias. Moreover, the careful reader 
soon discovers that Miss Calkins. is aware of facing 
concrete social problems, and is trying to face them ; 
and that her theory is elaborated with direct refer- 
ence to questions agitating contemporary men and 
women. Taken together with the excellent notes 
appended to the body of the book, and the literature 
there cited or referred to, the book is one of merit. 
It will be of service to those who are anxious to 
base their moral theory upon a knowledge of rele- 
vant social and psychological fact. Although an ex- 
pert in psychology and a trained scientist, Miss Cal- 
kins finds it possible to vanquish the materialistic in- 
terpretation of social phenomena and to establish 
the superior claims of moral idealism. As a book 
written for the serious general reader as well as for 
the college student, and as an incentive to thinking 
on problems of personal conduct and social renova- 
tion, it is well conceived and ably executed. 

THE SOUL OF DENMARK. By Shaw Desmond. 
277 pages. Scribner. 

The neutral countries, just now, are escapes in 
almost as romantic a sense as the middle ages or 
the fictional principalities of novelists. We have a 
curiosity as to what existence is outside the war. 

The Soul of Denmark is a social critique of the 
Danish nation. Politics, co-operative dairying, 
system of high schools, fat, art, spiritual inertia, and 
divorce are analyzed as so many manifestations of 
the national temperament. The quantity and 
variety of observations that Mr. Desmond has been 
able to make and record in four years are a testi- 
mony to his activity and alertness, and, if occasion- 
ally in one's course through his pages one doubts 
that so many emanations could be accurately probed 
in so limited a time, it is a convincing portrait of 
the Dane that emerges from the masses of detail. 
Moreover, Mr. Desmond found a dramatic crisis 
ready to hand in the war; so that there is the thrill of 
the novel in the exhibition of the character of the 
Dane under test circumstances. v Critic and skeptic, 
tolerant towards himself and others, inaccessible to 
any disturbing emotion or supersensual enthusiasm, 
he stands outside the war, uncomprehending, and 
placidly reaping its chance harvest. Like so many 
writers with a thesis to prove he assumes a special 
vocabulary. " Three-dimensional," the sixth sense, 
" to propogand " he amply explains and illustrates 
his phrases but quotation marks follow upon the 
heels of capitals until one longs for a paragraph of 
words used in an every-day manner. But these dis- 
tracting mannerisms are only superficial. Mr. 
Desmond's passion for Georg Brandes has not been 
unavailing, and it is in a finely critical spirit that 
he has made his appraisal of the Danish soul.

SOCIAL WORK. By Richard C. Cabot. 188 
pages. Houghton Mifflin. 

Richard C. Cabot believes in social work. He 
seems to believe in it as a constructive part in 
progress. In the first he is right; so long as there 
is a system of economic organization that turns out 
people who lack opportunity, who, when any inter- 
ruption occurs in the undeviating program of earn- 
ing a living, lack funds for the barest necessities, we 
must provide relief, whether publicly or privately. 
He is right also in placing emphasis on the medical 
approach to social work it is probably the only 
approach that does not tend to fasten the insult of 
charity and subservience on the beneficiary. He is 
right in emphasizing the need for self-reliance and 
information, rather than for alms and nostrums. He 
is right in so far as social work is ever right. But 
social work is a symptom of a great wrong: it can 
not, by and large, be constructive. It presupposes a 
state of society in which large numbers of the popu- 
lation will not be a'ble to provide for themselves, 
educationally, medically, "economically. Modern in- 
dustry forces the study and practise of social work 
as a profession. Dr. Cabot dodges this issue. He 
says, for instance, " Bad conditions of industry are 
doubtless a factor in the production of tuberculosis, 
but we must realize how many and important the 
other factors are. The eight or ten hours a person 
spends in industry is often a small factor in produc- 
ing his ill 'health, compared to the fourteen or six- 
teen hours he spends outside the industry." We 
should like to ask Dr. Cabot why workers spend 
their hours outside the factory in ways that are in- 
jurious to health. Again in his discussion of the 
moral poisoning of monotony he declines to meet the 
facts half-way. He describes the sense of injustice 
as " a sense that it is not right that somebody else, 
whom the Lord did not make very different, has 
so much more of money and opportunity and happi- 
ness than the person himself has. It is altogether a 
secondary question to discuss whether that is true or 
not. I do not myself believe that the rich are any 
happier than the poor. On the whole, I think the 
evils of money are just as great as the evils of 
poverty." "Can we do anything about it?" he 
asks. "We can help people to see things differ- 
ently." It is a pity that Dr. Cabot, a leader in the 
study and practice of social work should have so 
limited his horizon and his criticism to the immediate, 
not the fundamental causes for the necessity of relief. 

THE SEE-SAW. By Sophie Kerr. 360 pages. 
Doubleday, Page. 

Here is an example of what may happen when the 
writer of a novel manipulates the strings with too 
much confidence. Miss Kerr is continually appear- 
ing over the heads of her chief personages, beckon- 
ing to the reader to share her own impregnable be- 
lief in the adroitness of her handiwork. Whenever 
she contrives a particularly smart speech to put into 



the mouth of one of her characters, the other person 
who chances to be involved in the dialogue is dele- 
gated to put it in italics by repeating it. Thus the 
philandering husband describes himself as " only 
imperfectly domesticated," and evokes Miss Kerr's 
approval in the mouth of the next speaker : " That's 
a wonderful description of you, Harleth. I'd never 
thought of you in just those words, but that's it, 
exactly. You're very imperfectly domesticated." 
After a time one begins to take exception to this 
repeated throwing of a sop to sophistication, and to 
suspect the author of sparring for cosmopolitan 
smartness with a boarding-school reach. Especially 
in such passages as this: 

" What is it about Leila," she asked, " that attracts 
men so much? She isn't clever she isn't sweet. She 
isn't, when you come right down to it, so wonderfully 
good-looking. So far as I can see, she entirely lacks 
what Barrie calls ' charm,' in the usual acceptance of 
the word. What is it, Curt? Do you know?" 

" Oh, yes, I know," said Curt, dryly. " I can tell you 
in one word provocation. Or, sex. I don't mean that 
she's feminine I mean that she's female." 

" Upon my word! " gasped Marcia. " Have you taken 
to reading Dreiser novels, Curt?" 

" I admit that I was coarse," returned Curt, calmly, 
helping himself to salad, " but you asked me and I an- 
swered you according to the best of my belief and 
opinion." 

After this amazing calmness in the face of salad 
and sex, we were quite prepared for the further 
revelations of the intricate Leila, even unto her ulti- 
matum, which runs: " It's simply not decent to 
have no pearls." 

AMERICAN CIVIL CHURCH LAW. By Carl Zoll- 
man. 473 pages. Studies in History, Economics 
and Public Law. Vol. (LXXVII.) Columbia 
University Press. 

The title of the series does not very clearly fit 
this work. It is neither history, economics, nor 
public law. Unmistakably it is a book on private 
dogmatic law. But since any somewhat complete 
treatment of a subject in private law necessarily 
must have in it something of history, a little, at 
least suggestively, of economics, and cannot wholly 
avoid some of the many phases of public law, we 
may overlook a mere inconsistency of form; and 
this is especially true when the author's labor can 
be commended, as is the case here, and when he 
cannot be held accountable beyond his own work 
which is tcorrectly enough entitled, or for the re- 
strictive aims of a faculty of political science of 
some twenty years ago. Chapters dealing with Re- 
ligious Liberty, Forms, Nature and Powers of Co- 
operation, Church Constitutions, Schisms, Church 
Decisions, Clergymen, Officers, Pew Rights, and 
Cemetaries, sufficiently indicate the scope of treat- 
ment. It is a typical lawbook with the usual ap- 
apparatus of footnotes of cases without which a

trine) would be worthless. Naturally the author, 
writing as he does primarily for lawyers and not 
laymen, observes too closely at times the current 
fashions. It is solemnly and punctiliously set down 
that " putting ' hat drops ' in the dog of a worship- 
per with intent to disturb the congregation by the 
convulsions into which the animal is thrown " will 
subject the offender to punishment under a " dis- 
turbance of meeting " statute. A mere layman 
would have guessed as much, but a lawyer must have 
more certain information and the author gives just 
such a case in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. 
The same chapter is full of similar legal bromides. 
The canon that the obvious is not to be mentioned 
is not the rule in the writing of lawbooks. Not all 
of the chapters, however, exhibit the fault of string- 
ing together a list of cases without analytical dis- 
crimination which is the common vice of American 
law textbooks. The chapter on Church Decisions, 
for example, is a critical, and we believe a valuable, 
commentary on the leading case of Watson v. Jones. 
The chapter on Religious Liberty, also, is well 
written and presents a readable, interesting, and 
clear statement of the reaction of our system of 
law to Christianity. 

THE MULATTO IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By Edward Byron Reuter. 417 pages. 
Badger; Boston. 

The book in hand purports to be " an attempt 
to state one sociological problem arising when two 
races, divergent as to culture and distinct as to 
physical appearance, are brought into contact under 
the conditions of modern life and produce a hybrid 
offspring whose characteristic physical appearance 
prevents them from passing as either the one or 
the other." Beginning with the earliest inter-racial 
intercourse in later primitive times, when no mixed 
blood race seems to have existed, we are taken in a* 
survey of the Moriscoes, the Eurasians, the half 
bred Eskimos, the zambos, the metis, the mestizos, 
and many other half-castes, as a preliminary to the 
study of the American mulatto. An historical 
study of the rise of this last type in the United 
States shows that like other half-castes it is the 
result of illicit relations between men of the 
" superior " and women of the " inferior " race. 
Aspiring in effect to an unattainable status with 
the white race, the mulattto is admired by the 
pure blacks because of his white blood, and he is 
practically forced into the role of leader among his 
darker fellows. This function of leader he is able 
to fill as well as he does partly because of his close 
contact with the whites. As a matter of fact most 
eminent American Negroes have actually been 
mulattoes. " The relative chances of a black child 
and a mulatto child . . . attaining to a posi- 
tion among the elite of the race are from thirty- 
four to fifty, or perhaps a hundred times as great 
in the case of the child of mixed blood." To sub- 



stantiate this generalization direct inquiries were 
made into the ancestry of 4,267 Negroes or 
mulattoes who have at some time been men or 
women of at least a certain degree of note. Whether 
this cultural prominence of the mulatto is chiefly 
the effect of an original superiority in his nature, 
or whether it is because of his better opportunities 
we do not know. Nor would the existing sociolog- 
ical situation be much affected if we did know. The 
mulattoes are, persistently, the property owners, 
the business men, the agitators, the educated men, 
and the spokesmen of their race. In ethnological 
and social study they must be examined in such a 
light; and it must be borne in mind that truths 
which will apply to the mulattoes will not apply 
to the pure Negroes. This summary is a poor 
reflection of the fine scientific scholarship displayed 
in this unique ethnological book a book as charm- 
ing in style and as well documented in fact as 
Crawley's Mystic Rose. 

THE NEAR EAST FROM WITHIN ANONYMOUS. 
256 pages. Funk and Wagnalls. 

For this type of book, currently classified as his- 
tory, there is little or nothing to be said. Put out 
anonymously by a secret political agent, attached, as 
the context proves, to the German Foreign Office, 
it is as remarkable for its abysmal ignorance of all 
the veritable forces at work in human life as it is 
detestable for its flunkey-like attitude toward the 
great and powerful, and its busy, self-important re- 
tailing of the gossip which circulates in their ante- 
chambers. In the decade before the outbreak of the 
Great War this particular agent flitted like a bat 
through the dusky air enveloping the courts of Con- 
stantinople, Belgrade, Sofia, and the other Balkan 
states, covertly entering into a note-book the echoes 
and alarums which reached him with an eye to the 
day when he might advantageously dispose of them 
to the highest bidder. An unsystematic hodge- 
podge, the book is a good illustration of the manner 
in which an ignoble mind sees history, and shows 
besides how history, taken on this level, is indistin- 
guishable from that ugly monster which Virgil long 
ago portrayed for us under the name of Rumor. 

-What is there new and remotely valuable in these 
two hundred pages of gossip which a student, mak- 
ing the serious, social-political approach to the Bal- 
kan problem, is likely to have missed and may find 
advisable to take into account in his coherent story 
of human evolution? Nothing, absolutely nothing! 
Let us convince ourselves once and for all and remain 
satisfied that the fluctuating opinions of sovereigns 
and leading politicians, at least in the impoverished 
form in which they reveal themselves to the av- 
erage official of what each nation euphemistically 
calls its Intelligence Bureau, are historically negli-

A SHORT HISTORY OF ROME, 44 B.C. 476 
A.D. By Guglielmo Ferrero and Corrado 
Barbagallo. 516 pages. Putnam. 

The second volume of Ferrero and Barbagallo's 
new history is a complete disappointment of the 
hopes raised by their vivid story of the monarchy 
and the republic. The authors indulge in a good 
deal of awkward propaganda on behalf of limited 
monarchy as a form of government; they have only 
a sneer for the attempts of Stocism to preserve 
liberty of conscience during the first century; and 
they succeed in making the parallel growth of 
anarchy and absolutism, which is the great phenom- 
enon of the third and fourth centuries, perfectly 
incomprehensible. The rise of Christianity, which 
was of course mainly due to the despair of the state 
felt by the lower classes, is given the most perfunc- 
tory treatment. One serious question is suggested 
by the appearance of such a book. Our schools and 
colleges are flooded with " textbooks " which are 
but little if at all superior to this composition of 
Ferrero's. These textbooks narrate selected and 
superficial events, but of the unbroken current of 
human desire which underlies events they tell noth- 
ing. The picture of the past which is thus inserted 
into the mind of the ordinary student becomes a 
ridiculous and dangerous falsehood. What shall 
be done when professional historians spread the 
illusion of knowledge and not the reality? 

A HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA. By William 
Warren Sweet. 283 pages. The Abingdon 
Press. 

To present the history of the whole of Latin 
America Mexico, Central America, and South 
America from the time of the Spanish conquest 
up to the present day, together with a brief state- 
ment of conditions and problems, in a single volume 
of convenient size, is a bold enterprise. It has been 
fairly well accomplished by the Professor of History 
at De Pauw University, in A History of Latin 
America. The work is done conscientiously and the 
book has real value for reference. The style is dry 
in the extreme, although the matter in itself is 
of almost romantic interest. There are many 
typographical errors and misspellings, particularly 
in personal names a thing unfortunate where 
sources for correction are little accessible. The 
illustrations are few and of no artistic value, being 
clumsily grouped reproductions of portraits too 
different in style, age, and proportions to go well 
on one plate, but maps and diagrams add to the 
usefulness of the book. 



FIELD AND STREAM. By John Burroughs. 337 
pages. Houghton Mifflin. 

This book exhibits a phenomenon in these days 
most rare a first class mind at peace with the 
world, contemplating the seasonal processsion of 
Nature and the placid circling of the stars. What 
Burroughs says of Emerson he might have written 
of himself: he goes into the woods "not to bring 
home bird or botany lore, but to fetch the words 
of the wood-god to men." The section of the vol- 
ume devoted to field sketches opens " not so much 
a notebook full of ^ notes of birds and trees as 
a heart warmed and refreshed by sympathetic inter- 
course and contact with these primal forces." In 
Study Notes, observations made afield come to fruit- 
age in philosophy, confessedly uncodified, but set 
out with a richness of feeling that is too often lack- 
ing in philosophical writing. Appropriately enough 
there are here discovered new paragraphs in ap- 
preciation of Whitman, " the one cosmic poet, more 
occupied with the orbs than any other and all other 
poets." And likewise a question phrased in epic 
language : " Are we ourselves anything more than 
the tracks of the Eternal in the dust of the earth ?" 



LA JEUNESSE DE JOUBERT. By Andre 
Beaunier. 349 pages. Perrin et Cie., Paris. 

The twofold interest of this study is that it 
brings to light fresh material both about the youth 
of Joubert and about his love affair, hitherto un- 
known, with the wife of Restif de la Bretonne. 
Thus the chaste and academic legend concerning the 
moralist, promoted by Sainte-Beuve, Matthew 
Arnold, and Mr. Babbitt, is in danger of being 
overthrown. M. Beaunier insists that Joubert re- 
mains primarily a sensitive and withdrawn " soul "; 
but in his youth at least the soul seems to have 
taken on quite a corporeal covering. We have 
details concerning the influence of his mother, the 
character of his early churchly education, his first 
worldly period and his frequentations in Paris. 
These included such men as Diderot, the light poet 
Dorat, Fontanes as intimate friend and through him 
the notorious Restif de la Bretonne. Scamp as he 
was* Restif had a wife who was little better, and 
one wonders what Joubert was doing in that galley. 
The rather scandalous and disillusioning story of 
this triangle now appears as revealed in the fiction 
of Restif himself, in which Joubert and Fontanes 
figure, disguised by obvious anagrams. Restif, 
sensualist and realist, shows up all parties pitilessly. 
The construction of M. Beaunier's book is ram- 
bling and episodic and devotes too much space to 
third-rate characters only slightly connected with 
Joubert. But it is written with subtlety and under- 
standing and the main thesis of Joubert's rather 
grimy " affair " is henceforth established hardly 
to his credit as a man. though it may have given him 
material and penetration as a moraliste.

Books of the Fortnight 

The Cost of Living: A Personal Reflection and Its Out- 
come (132 pages; Box 282, Yale Station, New Haven, 
Conn.), is a polemic against human providence, 
which takes refuge, under the whip of fear and 
uncertainty, in life insurance, safe investments, and 
so forth, and a plea for a wholehearted acceptance 
of divine Providence, in accordance with the injunc- 
tion to take no thought for the morrow asking what 
we shall eat and wherewithal we shall be clothed. A 
book written with Tolstoyan simplicity and candor. 
Review later. 

Comparative Education, by H. W. Foght, A. H. Hope, 
I. L. Kandel, W. Russell, and Peter Sandiford (500 
pages; Button), takes stock, with the aid of sta- 
tistical tables, of the educational systems of the 
United States, Germany, England, France, Canada 
and Denmark. Review later. , 

Freedom of Speech in Wartime, by Zechariah Chafee, 
Jr. (41 pages; Dunster House Bookshop; Cambridge, 
Mass.), Number 1 of -Dunster House Papers, is a 
reprint from the Harvard Law Review of a preg- 
nant criticism of the working of the Espionage Act 
during wartime. The author concludes, after an 
examination of numerous cases in point, that " in 
our efforts to silence those who advocated peace 
without victory we prevented at the very start that 
vigorous threshing out of fundamentals which might 
today have saved us from a victory without peace." 

The Greater "War, by George D. Herron (101 pages; 
Kennerley), endeavors to show that the war is not 
yet at an end and that a greater war between Ger- 
manism and democracy " now spreads its vaster and 
more fateful fields." An erratic book that leaves 
the reader with a lingering curiosity as to whether 
Mr. Herron did not actually found the National 
Security League rather than the Rand School. 

Germany's Moral Downfall, by Alexander W. Craw- 
ford (217 pages; Abingdon Press), is another one 
of those books which the presses continue to put 
forth because they have not the power to overcome 
the original impetus that the war gave these dis- 
quisitions. It is time to restate Newton's law: Minds 
at rest continue at rest, and minds in motion con- 
tinue in motion, unless externally acted upon by the 
publisher. 

German Social Democracy During the War, by Edwyn 
Bevan (280 pages; Button), puts together in a con- 
secutive narrative the principal events which make 
up the history of the German Social Bemocrat Party 
from the outbreak of the Great War to November 
1917. 

Russia and Germany at Brest-Litovsk, by Judah L. Mag- 
nes 193 pages; Rand School of Social Science), 
does not claim to open secret sources for the first 
time, or to close finally the controversy to 
which this subject has given rise. Rather the author 
sets for himself the task of arranging in chronological 
order and linking together with notes of his own 
writing the material on the Brest-Litovsk affair 
which has already appeared in the press. Students 
of Russian history will find ample use for this un- 
pretentious compilation. 

Germany's New War Against America, by Stanley Frost 
(190 pages; Button), is symptomatic of the latest 
psychosis developed by the New York Tribune and 
Mr. A. Mitchell Palmer in reaction to a post-bellum 
"menace." For Union League readers only! 



Women and World Federation, by Florence Guertin Tut- 
tle (250 pages; McBride), is a plea for women to 
assume the initiative in creating an effective struc- 
ture of lasting peace. It appears that Mr. William 
H. Taft, in his introduction, confuses such a struc- 
ture with the one destined to support the present 
coalition of governments. 

What America Did, by Florence Finch Kelly (343 pages; 
Button), takes the reader forth on a kind of Cook's 
tour glimpsing all the multifarious activities of Amer- 
ica's war. A supplementary volume on What Amer- 
ica Bidn't is needed to complete the story. 

Helping France, by Ruth GaSnes (235 pages; Button), 
presents an account of the activities of the American 
Red Cross in France; the volume is illuminated with 
reproductions of etchings and wood-cuts of French 
villages and villagers. 

Ireland's Fight for Freedom, by George Creel (199 
pages; Harper), attempts to set forth the high lights 
of Irish history. A book not to be compared with 
Irvine's Carson or Hackett's Ireland. 

Vestigia: Reminiscences of Peace and War, by Charles 
a Court Repington (373 pages; Houghton Mifflin), 
have the interest that adheres to a career that took 
the author through the Second Afghan War, the Bur- 
mese War, the Atbara Campaign, the Omdurman 
Campaign, and the South African War. Readers 
must, however, wait for a second volume to learn 
of the author's more sedentary, but not less exciting 
adventures as military adviser to Tory newspaper- 
dom. 

Commemoration of the Centenary of the Birth of James 
Russell Lowell, (88 pages; Scribner), records for 
the American Academy of Arts and Letters under 
whose auspices the New York Centenary was held, 
February 19-22, 1919 the addresses, poems, and 
exercises of that occasion, made memorable by the 
contributions of John Galsworthy, Alfred Noyes, and 
Stephen Leacock, besides the American speakers. 

Studies in the Elizabethan Drama, by Arthur Symons (261 
pages; Button), adds to the publishers' recent Sy- 
mons volumes a collection that includes ten essays 
on Shakespearean plays, and essays on Massinger, 
Bay, and Middleton and Rowley. Penetrating criti- 
cism here reinforces a scholarship devoid of pedantry. 
Review later. 

The Changing Drama: by Archibald Henderson (320 
pages; Stewart & Kidd, Cincinnati), reprints a sur- 
vey which, appearing just before the outbreak of the 
War, received from the stage less substantiation of 
its predictions than might have been the case had the 
theater been permitted an uninterrupted developr 
ment. Whether the " new " drama will now pick 
up where it (or most of it) left off in 1914, remains 
to be seen ; but certainly no other discussion of the 
" dramatic renaissance " unrolls before the interested 
playgoer so broad or rich a panorama of the field. 
Review later. 

A Treasury of War Poetry: Second Series, edited by 
George Herbert Clarke (361 pages; Houghton Mif- 
flin), includes several hundred bad poems about the 
war and a few that are good enough to redeem the 
volume. Beyond the patriotic blurbs of the numer- 
ous stay-at-homes rise the few clear voices of the 
warrior poets themselves: Gilbert Frankau, Robert 
Nichols, Siegfried Sassoon, Frederic Manning. These 
men have written poems; the rest, literature. Re- 
view later.

Dreams, and Gibes, by Edward Sapir (72 pages; Rich- 
ard G. Badger; Boston), is seldom of the magic of 
poetry, but often of such harsh, warped magic as a 
poet these days can at best hope to wring from life. 
These lines reveal a free, idealistic spirit whom the 
world finds more than usual difficulty in hog-tying 
and hamstringing. Many of Mr. Sapir's shorter 
pieces show a valuably suggestive turn of thought 
not quite poetically " turned." Excrescences, too, 
are apt to be tacked on these tiny things, at their 
endings. Of the longer poems, strangely enough, 
two in more conventional forms, The Woman on the 
Bridge and The Water Nymph, come perhaps as 
close as any to beauty as well as depth. 

Ironica, by Donald Evans (75 pages; Nicholas L. Brown; 
New York), is at first reading but another slightly 
more conventional volume in the direct line of this 
poet's Discords, Sonnets from the Patagonian, Two 
Deaths in the Bronx, and Nine Poems from a Vale- 
tudinarian save for one far-surpassing new narra- 
tive, At the Bar. In the Ironica section itself, among 
the stilted self-imitative lyrics, Evan's insight into 
unpleasantnesses is still present, but with what, on 
second weighing, seems a surer aptness of philosophy 
and phrases ; at witness here, After a Two-Hour 
Dinner, Without Benefit of Surgery, and Nature's 
Cowardice. 

Footsteps and Fantasies, by C. J. Druce (64 pages; 
Longmans, Green), has a title which aptly mirrors 
its content. Reality is echoed like a footstep in some 
of the verses, while in others the mood and imagery 
are fantastic. Mr. Druce writes with smooth lyric 
vigor. 

The Yale Book of Student Verse: 19101919, edited by 
John W. Andrews, Stephen Vincent Benet, John 
Chipman Farrar, and Pierson Underwood (212 
pages; Yale University Press), comprises the selected 
work of twenty-five Yale poets of the last decade. 
Sound and workmanlike verse with little radicalism ; 
Tennyson would have approved of it. The poems 
by Stephen Vincent Benet are distinctly the best in 
the volume. Most of his confreres write either as 
adolescents or as cynical old men ; he alone displays 
the fine enthusiasm of youth. In compiling his last 
college anthology, Mr. Schnittkind chose only one 
poem from Yale. One wonders why, considering 
that the work of these poets, in spite of their short- 
comings, far excels the standard of The Poets of the 
Future. 

The Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson(219 pages; Boni 
& Liveright), should both prove the most valuable 
recent addition to their Modern Library. The ex- 
quisite lyrics of that tragically frustated spirit have 
never been too accessible, nor his prose works suffi- 
ciently known. This volume omits, unfortunately, the 
prose decorations, but it reprints his characteristic 
collection Dilemmas: Stories and Studies in Sentiment 
(1895) and adds the Arthur Symons Memoir. 

Sylvia and Michael, by Compton Mackenzie (323 pages; 
Harper), says the author, "is really Book three of 
Sylvia Scarlett." These " later adventures of Sylvia " 
plunge her into the war, in the Rumanian theater, 
and leave her sighing that everything comes to an 
end. " Except one thing," says Michael Fane, about 
to propose marriage and be accepted, " and that 
sets all the rest going again." So we have probably 
not yet done with these delightful puppets. Sylvia 
Scarlett was reviewed in Scofield Thayer's essay on 
Compton Mackenzie in THE DIAL for November 30, 
1918; Sylvia and Michael will be reviewed shortly. 



The Tunnel: Pilgrimage IV, by Dorothy M. Richardson 
(342 pages; Knopf), gives the reader, as in the 
previous books, an intensely subjective portrait of 
the heroine. But whereas her life had, in them, a 
unity however artificial, its increased complexity 
with Miriam's solitary independence in London 1 
serves to enhance the difficulties of the author's 
method. The impressions are not so sharp, are more 
scattered, in short, are less often vividly realized. 
The distinctively feminine quality of the author's 
insight, however, seems intensified. Miss Richard- 
son's work remains intrinsically interesting. Review 
later. 

Jinny the Carrier, by Israel Zangwill (607 pages; Mac- 
millan), is a tale of rural life in Essex, which the 
author describes as a " bland " novel, " to be read 
in bed with a sore throat." There is plenty of broad 
humor throughout, in the well individualized char- 
acters with their crotchety notions of conduct and 
religion, and Jinny is a joy, but the novel as a whole 
is inordinately slow and long drawn out. Review 
later. 

The Passionate Pilgrim, by Samuel Merwin (403 pages; 
Bobbs-Merrill), is an attempt to foist upon us as the 
verisimilitude of genius a most unlikely figure of a 
down-and-out novelist who becomes suddenly force- 
ful enough to bludgeon his way back to the ranks 
of the successful. The book is badly conceived, clut- 
tered, and carelessly written. 

Ramsey Milholland, by Booth Tarkington (218 pages; 
Doubleday, Page), is a series of chapters out, of the 
life of an inarticulate wholesomely dull, exaggerat- 
edly average American boy, whose later school days 
are interrupted by war service over-seas. The key- 
note is simplicity both of event and method, and the 
performance of the volume is precisely adequate to its 
promise. 
f 

The Young Visiters, by Daisy Ashford (105 pages; 
Doran), was written by a romantic nine-year-old 
if Sir James M. Barrie in his whimsical preface 
is not making game of his readers. It is a " novel n 
of Victorian high life, and the quaintly pretentious 
style and the engaging worldly wisdom of the little 
author make it luscious reading. 

The Man with the Lamp, by Janet Laing (313 pages; 
Dutton), presents through the medium of a love 
story the various attitudes of a scientist, the presi- 
dent of a small town Women's Patriotic League, a 
musician, and a spiritual young German, towards 
Germany and the Germans. Though the plot inclines 
toward the stupidly melodramatic, the author's treat- 
ment of her hero, the German boy, is interestingly 
sympathetic. 

Isaacs, by Joseph Gee (317 pages; Lippincott), is an 
episodic and somewhat superficial study of a London 
Jew, in the mold of fiction. The humor seldom rises 
above that which may be extracted from the narra- 
tion of sharp practices in petty business. 

Renee Mauperin,by E. and J. de Goncourt (234 pages; 
Modern Library, Boni & Liveright), appears 
translated in a popular edition, with Zola's Notice 
included. First published in 1864, the vignette chap- 
ters of this acute and sympathetic study of the con- 
temporary French scene, with their depiction of the 
complacencies of revolutionists turned prosperously 
conservative and the rebellions of a sterling youi_ 
girl remain singularly modern. And the long record 
of Renee's mortal illness belong to the art that '" 
timeless.

The beauty and poetry of the sea flavors every page., and the adoring love which men of Latin blood have 
from all time for the Mediterranean, " our sea," whose history is that of the civilization of Europe. 
Though not a " war novel," it incidentally supplements that unrivalled record " The Four Horsemen of 
the Apocalypse," by showing the method used to induce neutrals living along these shores to supply 
contraband stores to the gray submersibles slinking like shadows past Gibraltar. There is mystery, 
intrigue, intense passion in the story. It is a masterpiece, by the greatest of living novelists.

May Sinclair's New Novel 

MARY OLIVIER: A LIFE 

By the Author of "The Divine Fire" "The Tree of Heaven" etc., etc. 

May Sinclair has here written a most unusual and original novel, 
both in its method and content. " Mary Olivier " is a direct presen- 
tation of a woman's life, her thoughts, sensations and emotions, told 
without artificial narrative or analysis, without autobiography. The 
main interest of this remarkable story lies in Mary Olivier's search 
for reality, her relations with her mother, father and three brothers, 
and her final passage from the bondage of infancy, the conflicts of 
childhood and adolescence, the disenchantments of maturity, to the 
freedom, peace and happiness of middle age. The period covered 
is from 1865 when Mary is two years old to 1910 when she is forty- 
seven. 

" Mary Olivier " is a book that will stir wide comment. It is 
perhaps the finest of all Miss Sinclair's novels. Published Sep- 
tember 2. $2.00 

Eden Phillpotts 9 New Novel 

STORM IN A TEACUP 

By the Author of "Old Delabole," "Brunei's Tower/' etc., etc. 

11 Storm in a Teacup " carries on Mr. Phillpotts' novels dealing 
with the human side of the different industries. Here the art of 
paper making furnishes the background. Mr. Phillpotts tells a 
delightful and highly entertaining story of a young wife who elopes 
with a man of high intellectual ability because she considers her 
husband commonplace. This decision on her part leads to a num- 
ber of unusual and frequently amusing situations. " Storm in a Tea- 
cup " is Phillpotts at his best, a delightfully human story told with 
skill and art. $1.60

The High Cost of Waste 



o MATTER NOW BEFORE the American people is 
of a more pressing character and significance than 
the steeply mounting prices of those commodities 
upon which life directly or indirectly depends. The 
suggestions for meeting this problem which have 
come out of Washington fail to take into account 
the character of business and industry. The pre- 
tentious attack upon profiteers is an avoidance of 
the real issue, which is not the profits of the owner 
but the excessive waste, social and economic, which 
is inevitable when industrial equipment is primarily 
operative, not to satisfy social needs but to produce 
profits for the employer. 

A scientific and competent survey would show 
that unnecessary waste follows from: 

1. The diversion of labor and resources to socially 
useless or socially superfluous purposes. 

2. Those practices of business competition which either 
curtail output or, by duplication of equipment and con- 
cellation of effort, increase the labor and material cost of 
the product. 

3. The ignorance of actual social needs and the con- 
sequent failure to adapt production to meet them. 

We are certain that the final solution for 
the difficulties of living encountered by the aver- 
age citizen can be found only in a more intelligent 
utilization of our productive capacity. The prac- 
ticability of a tremendously increased production has 
been demonstrated, both in this country and else- 
where, by the experiences of the Great War, and 
there remains no question as to whether it is possible 
mechanically, with the existing industrial equipment, 
to make more than ample provision for the material 
needs of every inhabitant of the United States. 

We disagree with those who believe that the 
necessary increase in production can be secured mere- 
ly by increasing the output of the individual worker, 
even as we disagree with those who would bait the 
taker of an excessive profit. For the inevitable 
waste, which will follow this greater production of 
socially useless or socially superfluous goods, will ef- 
fectually cancel any increase in individual productiv- 
ity. Nor should it be forgotten that it is psychologi- 
cally impossible to induce labor to increase its pro- 
duction per diem or per capita when it is becom- 
ing obvious to everyone that forces are in opera- 
tion which prevent a corresponding betterment 



of the physical well-being of the efficient worker. 
Furthermore waste results also from the ab- 
sorption of values through superfluous processes and 
handlings, which lessen the actual amount of life- 
sustaining goods that income will command, and 
therefore diminish the effective demand for the essen- 
tial industrial products. For if the average worker 
is unable to buy with his present high money wage 
as much as he was able to buy with the lower money 
wage which he received a few years ago, the cause 
can only be that, at certain steps in the process which 
brings food from the farms, clothing and shoes from 
the fields and factories, and housing from the forests 
and quarries, a portion of the values, far beyond 
what might be considered necessary or reasonable, 
has been absorbed in payment for useless exertion. 
This leads to a diminution of the real purchasing 
power of income, which in turn leads to deliberate 
restrictions upon production. 

And this process of absorbing values unnecessarily 
is increasing continually. As the industrial system 
develops it becomes more complex, more roundabout, 
affording a growing number of opportunities for 
non-productive middlemen to insert themselves be- 
tween the producer and the consumer. In many 
cases they who insert themselves do not add to the 
life sustaining values of the goods which pass 
through their hands, though they add to the price 
at which the goods are sold, bringing about a total 
which is excessive. 

At the same time, of course, the improvements in 
equipment and processes tend to offset, by cheaper 
production, these inserted charges. In normal times 
processes and methods improve perhaps faster than 
the middlemen can take up the slack. In all likeli- 
hood the worker has benefited by the industrial im- 
provements of the past hundred years, but in years 
such as , those through which we have just passed, 
the reverse is far nearer the truth. And since it is 
legally impossible at the present time to disallow the 
cost of these wasteful and useless practices, the 
country's workers are in the way of starving because 
our methods of sustaining life have become too high- 
ly refined. 

Another factor which artificially maintains pro- 



i8o

duction costs above the figure which would be justi- 
fied by the advanced state of industrial development 
is the practice of selling labor saving machinery at 
a price which bears no relation to the labor and 
equipment cost of manufacture, but at a price which 
is just below the saving in wages which the pur- 
chaser will realize through its use. 

And, finally, though this does not by any means 
complete the full list, the general restriction of pro- 
duction, such as we are now witnessing and which is 
brought about by a general fear of over-production, 
adds greatly to the cost at which goods can profitably 
be sold. When production is restricted below the 
possible maximum, there is added to the production- 
cost of the actual product the overhead of the idle 
equipment as well as the cost of the increased effort 
to sell on a listless market. Furthermore, wages are 
reduced or are kept down to the minimum during 
this period, with the result that the purchasing 
power of the community is restricted. 

All this in spite of the fact that, as the industrial 
arts develop, the cost of production, measured in 
labor-energy and equipment-time units, constantly, 
decreases. Unchecked by our misunderstanding of 
its nature, the industrial machinery already in exist- 
ence would produce more than a sufficiency for every 



one. Our present need is not to build new factories, 
but to operate intelligently those already in exist- 
ence; not to induce the army of industry to work 
more hours per week, but to release it from the re- 
strictions which divert its natural expenditures of 
energy to socially useless purposes; not to penalize 
the profiteer, but to insist that waste shall not be a 
source of profit to anyone. 

It is not hard to see that our industrial system is 
not functioning for the purpose for which it is in- 
tended, and that it is not producing at its full capac- 
ity. In this is to be found the explanation of the 
appalling predicament in which this country, in com- 
mon with other civilized countries, now finds itself. 

A complete and impartial investigation of the 
actual costs of production in the principal American 
industries must be made to determine the extent and 
character of the wastes which have crept into the 
process by which man must get from the earth those 
things upon which life depends. As the Federal 
Government will undertake neither a complete nor 
an impartial investigation, we are urging that a 
survey be made by experts who are ' scientifically 
qualified and are independent of political and finan- 
cial interests.

The Economic Crux 



ZJLLMOST ALL of the programs for reconstruc- 
tion and industrial relations recently issued by 
non-labor organizations and individuals contain, in 
some form, vigorous denunciation of restriction of 
output by the workers. That section of the pro- 
gram recently adopted by referendum vote of the 
Chamber of Commerce of the United States which 
deals with this topic may be taken as illustrative 
of the non-labor approach to the subject. It states 
the matter thus: 

Efficient production in conjunction with adequate wages 
is essential to successful industry. Arbitrary restriction 
on output below reasonable standards is harmful to wage 
earners, employers, and the public and should not be 
permitted. Industry, efficiency, and initiative, wherever 
found, should be encouraged and adequately rewarded, 
while indolence and indifference should be condemned. 

Such condemnations as this have been evoked by 
the labor union regulations limiting the amount of 
work or of production per worker and by the un- 
official practises among the workers themselves of 
deliberate curtailment of effort. The closing sen- 
tence of the above quotation implies that such 
restrictions are the concomitants of " indolence and 
indifference." But such a simple and ready ex- 
planation is open to serious questioning and is prob- 



ably due to a failure to comprehend the real motives 
behind the labor movement. 

The major premise upon which restriction of 
output is condemned is the proposition that only 
increased production can insure any permanent and 
general improvement in society. There are, of 
course, many who believe that a more equitable 
scheme of distribution would contribute more to 
the well-being and development of society; but a 
consideration of quantities available for distribu- 
tion, whether of capital wealth or of goods, must 
lead any reasonable person to concede that increased 
production is a prerequisite to such improvement, 
whatever else may follow. Enough of the neces- 
sary commodities there can never be because of the 
growth of consumption, both qualitatively and 
quantitatively: an increase, considered absolutely 
and relatively to the population, in the production 
of most commodities and services appears therefore 
to be an indisputable need of a developing and im- 
proving civilization. 

Why then should labor organizations practice 
restriction of output? Or, setting aside restriction 
of output during working hours, why should labor 
organizations seek a progressive reduction of hours 



1919 



THE DIAL 



181 



of work, having obtained a sixty hour week, seeking 
one of fifty-four, then of forty-eight, until now, in 
many trades where a forty-four hour week is in 
force, one of thirty-six hours is under discussion as 
the next demand? To many persons, and par- 
ticularly to employers, such a policy appears social 
suicide; while" they may assent to a decrease from 
the demonstrably excessive hours of yesterday, they 
can find in these continued demands for a shorter 
working week solely a manifestation of " indolence 
and indifference." 

Yet, behind these demands for a progressive 
reduction in hours of work, the literature on the 
labor movement discloses a methodical and reasoned 
program. In most industries the workers suffer 
from the lack of continuous employment; in the 
needle trades, for example, periods of intense 
activity for a few months alternate with periods of 
unemployment and consequent lack of wages. The 
same situation is found in almost all competitive 
enterprises. From coal and metal mining to food 
preparation, in practically every form of produc- 
tion, there is an alternation of expansion and con- 
traction of production, a taking on and a turning 
off of employees accordingly. To modify this sit- 
uation, and by prolonging the period of production 
to gain a greater continuity of employment, is the 
frankly announced purpose of labor's demands for 
a shorter and shorter working week. The reason- 
ing behind this procedure may be briefly stated: if 
the employer, operating on a fifty-four hour 
schedule, can in six months produce enough to gain 
a profit, then the adoption of a forty-four hour week 
will prolong to eight months the period of produc- 
tion necessary to gain an equivalent profit. The 
corollary of this reads : if the employer can produce 
enough in six months to gain a profit from one 
hundred employees, then a moderate restriction of 
output will force him to employ, say one hundred 
and twenty-five, permitting twenty-five additional 
workers to gain an income for six months. 

It is believed that the foregoing is a fair statement 
of the aims of labor as expressed in this advocacy 
of shorter hours and restriction of output, apart 
from the considerations of health and well-being in- 
volved in their opposition to long hours. Thus it 
appears that we can find a reasonable explanation 
of labor's action, as a reaction against the industrial 
processes from which it suffers ; and in that explana- 
tion we find labor seeking what indolence would 
surely reject continuous work instead of desultory, 
unstable employment. 

The program of the Chamber of Commerce of 
the United States is not unconcerned with this ques- 
tion of continuous employment : 



Regularity and continuity of employment should be sought 
to the fullest extent possible and constitute a responsibil- 
ity resting alike upon employers, wage earners, and the 
public. 

The wage earners maintain that, in their restric- 
tions of output and their demand for shorter hours, 
their main object is continuous employment for all 
workers, and that, lacking other resource, they are 
forced to these means of obtaining that end. The 
burden of responsibility, accordingly, is shifted to 
the employers who, as quoted above, acknowledge 
the desirability of continuous employment. In 
placing partially on the workers the responsibility 
for achieving that end, they should, in fairness, 
acknowledge labor's manifest intent. 

What then of the employers' position and the 
means they adopt to discharge their share of the 
responsibility? They will urge that, in accordance 
with the fluctuations and the seasonal character of 
demand, they are forced to curtail production; thus 
they thrust the ultimate responsibility upon the 
fickle public. The student of industrial conditions 
will not ignore* the seasonal influence upon the 
demand for commodities nor its effect upon the pro- 
duction of the supply. But an analysis that rests 
with the statement that production is non-con- 
tinuous and consequently desultory is surely no 
analysis at all. 

The period beginning with the signing of the 
armistice gives an excellent field for the study of 
curtailment of production. When the armistice 
was- signed the industries of the country were, 
with the exception of those considered non-essen- 
tial, at the peak of productivity. During the 
war, consumers of practically all commodities were 
unable to obtain adequate supplies because of war 
requirements and the forced closing down of non- 
essential industries. Accumulated stocks of com- 
modities were almost entirely consumed during this 
period. With the exception of the army and navy 
almost all consumers were, at the signing of the 
armistice, in need of goods for consumption or for 
investment use. But, instead of finding produc- 
tion in all lines rapidly increasing after the first 
month or so of relaxation from the war strain, we 
find that the whole range of industries outside of 
those devoted to the production of the so-called 
luxuries cut down on production and laid off em- 
ployees in large numbers. The demand was ready 
to express itself in orders which would tax the in- 
dustrial capacity of the country, but the manufac- 
turers and producers found the demand not forth- 
coming at the prices they asked. These prices, ac- 
cording to the producers' statements, were necessary 
for the realization of profits at the rate they con- 



l82

sidered essential to the proper conduct of their enter- 
prises, and, in order to preserve that rate of profit, 
they abstained from production, with a resultant loss 
of employment to the workers. The reluctance of 
the middlemen to place orders was merely a phase 
of the price situation and was due to their fear of 
being caught in the falling market. 

One remarkable accompaniment of this post- 
armistice situation, revealing the producer's posi- 
tion, was the demand by producers for the " taking 
off of the harness of governmental regulation in 
order that the operation of the law of supply and de- 
mand might be restored." At the same time the pro- 
ducers of commodities of which the government 
had a surplus demanded that this surplus be with- 
held from the market, although the repeal of gov- 
ernment control and the operation of the law of 
supply and demand should logically have led to the 
marketing of the surplus and .the adjustment of 
prices accordingly. 

In refusing to produce unless an impoverished 
society was ready to pay the price demanded, and 
in persuading the government to refrain from 
marketing its surplus stocks of goods at prices the 
consumers were willing to pay, the producers of 
the country were acting in accordance with ac- 
cepted business policy. It is not the purpose of 
this discussion to criticise the activities of any group 
in society. So long as enterprise is freely encour- 
aged and is rewarded by such profits as it may ob- 
tain, present conditions are an inevitable result of 
socially sanctioned efforts. The task of suggesting 
modifications does not belong here, where the 
primary object is to interpret and explain. 

But, making due allowance for such unavoidable 
situations as may be found, the conclusion is in- 
escapable that, since the production of goods is 
stimulated by the profit incentive and since, profits 
can be, and are, procured by curtailing the supply 
and thereby enhancing the price of that which is 
produced, the responsibility for voluntary curtail- 
ment of production and for the consequent lack of 
continuous employment rests upon the shoulders of 
the employers. Even in the clothing trades the 
seasonal demand is fostered by the producers and 
distributors through changes in styles which make 
for increased purchases at profitable prices. 

The implications of this complex need exposition, 
for here we find an apparently inescapable economic 
crux: increased production per person and per unit 
of plant is essential to the progressive well-being of 
civilization, while the continuance of an economic 
system in which unrestricted enterprise is per- 
mitted and encouraged to seek profits involves 
the curtailment of production whenever profits 
are threatened. At present the workers, who 



suffer from this process, are complaining and seek- 
ing a change. This question is then presented : 
which is to suffer change or sacrifice the existing 
order of profit-making, or the progress of civiliza- 
tion and its apparent concomitant, improvement in 
the condition of labor. The crux seems unavoid- 
able, for the maintenance of a capitalistic industrial 
system in which unrestricted enterprise is en- 
couraged to seek its own reward in profits makes 
for curtailment of production whenever profit- 
making is thereby benefitted. 

This then is the major economic problem of to- 
day: the solution of the conflict between the profit 
incentive and the necessity for greater production. 
On the one side we see the capitalist producer seek- 
ing profits as high as obtainable under competitive 
conditions and practising curtailment of production, 
" capitalistic satotage," as Professor Veblen terms it, 
to enhance the price of goods sufficiently to insure 
such profits : on the other side we see labor advocat- 
ing shorter hours and practising restriction of out- 
put in an effort to force the prolongation of the 
period of production and thereby .to obtain con- 
tinuous employment. Labor is 1 also seeking, per- 
haps unconsciously, to increase production by 
increasing the sum total of yearly wages through 
continuous employment, and consequently the pur- 
chasing power which makes for production ; for one 
of the large factors in the variation of demand is 
a loss of purchasing power that forces the wage 
earners to lessen their purchases of food, clothing, 
and so on, when their employment ceases. 

The program of the revolutionary labor move- 
ment aims at taking over the industry of the country 
in order that the worker may enjoy continuous em- 
ployment at " wages " which are not jeopardized 
by the profit making technique, while production 
will be increased accordingly. 

The issue between capital and labor is joined and, 
while the interests of both may be the same, as is 
constantly reiterated, yet it appears that the further- 
ance of those interests will require a readjustment 
and modification of the present system of industrial 
control. 

To one seeking to discover the probable trend of 
things it appears not unlikely that this readjustment 
and modification may progress somewhat along the 
following lines. The recent years have witnessed 
a progressive extension of the class of public utilities 
to include more and more varied types of enterprises 
which the public, through the government, seeks to 
control. The public utility is an organization ob- 
ligated to render service (or to furnish commodities 
such as water, gas, electric power) upon demand, 
at rates fixed by the state and not fluctuating accord- 
ing to market conditions, and therefore it may not 



1919 



THE DIAL 



i8' 3 



practice the profit making technique. Government 
control is exercised over the " price " of the service 
or commodity and over the scope and character of 
the operations. 

It cannot be doubted that control of business-en- 
terprises, either directly or through fixing of prices, 
will form one of the major factors in politics and 
government from now on. In economic discussions 
public control assumes a larger part each year, and 
the " price system," with values fixed or determined 
by market forces, cannot long escape a critical 
analysis which may prove destructive of much that 
passes for economic theory. The " free play of 
economic forces " and " the law of supply and de- 
mand " upon close inspection appear to be the result- 
ants of many individual efforts to control com- 
modities and their prices, in order to obtain profits ; 
there are apparently few " economic " forces sus- 
ceptible of differentiation from natural forces, apart 
from these human efforts at control; the efforts of 
many individuals seeking control give the appearance 
of a force; and the concept of "enterprise," which 
seems to arise and function spontaneously, gives the 
appearance of freedom, all of which obscures the 
essential fact that the effort of enterprise means 
attempted control, partial or complete. 

If economic " forces " are the aggregate of like 
efforts at control, and are in effect "control, then 
' necessarily the issue becomes one, not of economic 
freedom versus economic control, but of choosing 
which control society finds desirable or advan- 
tageous individual or social. 

Society has found it desirable and advantageous ' 
to restrict enterprise seeking to operate in the public 
utility field ; in many states a certificate of necessity 
and convenience is required before a public utility 
may be started. Should the investigation of the 
possibilities of price fixing disclose that unrestricted 
enterprise makes for higher prices and social costs 
out of proportion to the gains involved, it is reason- 
able to assume that enterprise in productive lines 
will be controlled likewise. The fixing of prices 
generally will necessitate the restriction of enterprise 
to protect the existing producers working under 
those prices, as in the case of public utilities; and, 
as during the war, priority ratings will be required 
to discriminate between would-be purchasers who 
can no longer express their needs by bidding higher 
than others. The experience of the government 
price-fixers during the war suggests ideas' about the 
possible treatment of the inefficient or " marginal " 
producers, those fosterlings of unrestricted enter- 
prise, which are enlightening for the future. 

Undoubtedly the price system and free enterprise 
are to be subjected to much drubbing at the hands of 



politics and economics, while the efforts of labor to 
obtain self government in industry must bring about 
a modification of industrial organizations and 
processes. Whether the capitalistic system can sur- 
vive the demise of the price system and free enter- 
prise is an interesting speculation, but not relevant 
here. As enterprise is restricted and prices merge 
into rates, the form of industrial organization and 
its operation will tend toward the public utility 
order of regulated, fixed-return, non-competitive in- 
stitutions, with the employees largely in control. 

Curiously enough a modification of the profit 
making technique may be effected through the ac- 
counting procedure. Some of the engineers who 
have been studying the problems of production and 
costs have made perhaps the most suggestive and 
far reaching contribution to this economic complex 
in stating that, if the entrepreneur chooses to keep 
his plant idle because the market price for his 
product is not profitable, then the cost of that ab- 
stention from production (the accruing interest, 
depreciation, maintenance, and the like during the 
period of idleness) is net a part of the cost of pro- 
duction for the consumer to pay in the purchase 
price of the commodity, but rather is it a cost to be 
deducted from the profits of the enterprise for the 
sake of which it is incurred. In. other words, the 
overhead expenses of the idle plant are to be taken 
out of the profits and not passed on to the consumer, 
as though they were part of the production costs; 
thereby the abstention from production is to be 
penalized. When the full implication of this doc- 
trine put forth by reputable engineers is understood 
by economists and business men, the results will be 
worth observing. The line-up of the engineers with 
labor in seeking fuller utilization of the productive 
capacities of society emphasizes the conflict of ideals 
and aims which the reconstruction programs of the 
employers and the demands of labor involve. The 
intransigent attitude of many employers will prob- 
ably intensify the conflict but can scarcely prevent 
their ultimate defeat. The reported activity of the 
bankers promises a new development, in that they 
are said to be refusing financial aid to any producer 
who is uncompromising toward labor; apparently 
they prefer to concede a portion of capital's profits 
and control, rather than, by forcing labor to greater 
unity and stronger opposition, to further the revolu- 
tionary labor movement. In view of the growth of 
labor consciousness and unity, the historical record 
of such conflicts in the past, and the position of labor 
on the side of social progress, the outcome is almost 
mathematically predictable.

The World's Challenge to the Church 



ERHAPS THE CASUAL OBSERVER of things Sat 

up in a mild surprise when the first of the church 
programs for industrial regeneration was published. 
Then, as one denomination after another followed 
this plunge into unfathomed depths, his surprise 
must have deepened or perhaps it changed into 
humor or cynicism. But there were a few who, 
though long despairing of ever finding any vitality 
in organized religion, still hoped for a dying hope, 
and took courage from this promise of returning 
life. 

How deep ran the currents of belief and inten- 
tion in these various programs could not be told. 
In none of them was a promise of definite action 
made, and there were strange ambiguities in all. It 
remains to be seen whether the several church 
organizations which, during the past months, have 
raised hundreds of millions to evangelize the world, 
to carry the " Message " to every people, and which 
have announced that a reweaving of the industrial 
fabric must be considered an integral part of any 
evangelical program it remains to be seen whether 
these organizations will look the situation straight 
in the face. Have they really the necessary insight 
and courage, combined with adequate leadership? 
And will they use their funds and their frequently 
remarkable equipment to attack the problem 
scientifically ? 

Such an attitude will mean a definite break with 
hallowed traditions. Still, the Church must have 
realized by this time that the argument from Char- 
ity and Brotherhood, advanced for nearly nineteen 
hundred years, has proven ineffectual. The old 
methods of exhortation and pleading cannot be 
revamped, or merely given a new force. Simply 
to strengthen the voice under the pressure of a raw 
necessity, or to pitch it in a higher key, will stim- 
ulate no fresh reaction. 

But fortunately for the various churches and 
those Christian organizations that desire to lend 
their strength toward the rehabilitation of society, 
there is another way of effecting a change in the 
basis of social action and responsibility: they can 
seek out the underlying facts of a system through 
which society creates wealth for the few and pov- 
erty for the many. If the Church were to secure 
these facts and place them, with all their implica- 
tions, before a puzzled world, the materials for a 
new social structure would be at hand, and would 
be put together perhaps with the voluntary coop- 
eration of those who now are the worst malingerers. 

It is peculiarly significant and fortunate, too 



that now, for the first time in history, the facts 
upon which a new understanding of society might 
be based are at hand. The events of the past few 
years have forced into the public records a nearly 
complete account of how and by what means the 
rich are made richer and the poor made poorer, 
and of why and how the tremendous productivity 
of modern machinery has not greatly improved the 
lot of the common man. 

And it is fortunate for the church organizations, 
also, that the same stretch of time has discovered 
men who are capable of handling these facts and 
illustrating their significance. The economists and 
engineers who compose this group have pushed their 
researches further than mere tabulation, and have 
been forced to the conclusion that it is the waste- 
fulness of the commercial system, the ruthlessness 
inseparable from business competition, that makes 
real charity and brotherhood tantamount to busi- 
ness and commercial suicide. 

Science has played right into the hands of the 
Church, but will the Church seek out these scien- 
tists and secure their help ? Will the Church listen 
to their accounts beyond the point where it is appar- 
ent that the facts of industrial malversation w'ill 
cut like a knife through the straw house of our 
society, so solid in appearance? 

Time only can answer this question, and the 
decision is, after all, in the hands, not of the Church 
as an institution, but of individuals who are not 
more than human. But these individuals who are 
not more than human are the very ones who 
announced the various industrial programs not, it 
is probable, for lack of something better to do, but 
because the working time before chaos seemed to 
be measurable in months rather than in years. 

Let these churchmen look about them and 
observe the character of the system that has bred 
the unrest which is so greatly feared. They will 
see some tens of thousands of industrial enterprises 
within the bounds of the United States, and per- 
haps as many hundreds of thousands of business 
enterprises in the same area. They will see that 
every one of these, with negligible exceptions, i 
working at cross purposes with every other one. 
And besides, every one of them is working in the 
dark. It is part of the necessity of competition 
that aims and plans be kept secret, and that cost be 
counted only as a subtraction from the final (per- 
sonal) gain. If a certain bit of strategy be deter- 
mined upon in camera because it promises profits to 
its inventor, its cost even to the inventor must not 



1919

be taken too seriously. Just as in the Great War 
the decision of the German General Staff to employ 
poison gas took very little if any account of the 
equipment and labor-cost of preparation, or the 
effect upon the morals of the home population. 
Even the unescapable fact that England and France 
could play at the same game was discounted in 
view of the advantages of being the first in the field. 

Then came tanks and tank-guns, and raids and 
counter-raids by sea and air. Just as in today's 
markets there are advertisements and counter adver- 
tisements, sales campaigns and expensively attractive 
packages, rebates and cross freights, credit restric- 
tions and " bull " raids, publicity by packers and 
the long run of devices intended to benefit or pro- 
tect the interests of particular business men all 
of which cost the consumer somewhat more than 
their full price while bringing him something less 
than nothing. Business is very much like war, and 
with not all the blood left out, at that. 

In the recent war-to-end-war there were some on 
both sides, in all probability, who made money, who 
gained honor and glory. Perhaps there were some 
who were morally strengthened, for conflict of any 
sort brings out sleeping qualities of the human 
character, it quickens into life attributes which are 
admirable, it works to deprive the individual of 
that insularity which breeds selfishness. Similarly, 
the struggle of the market may produce some ben- 
efits which might not appear were a purely coopera- 
tive society to take the place of the recognized order. 
But before voting to retain perpetual war and an 
absolutely competitive market, we might set about 
determining whether there has accrued through them 
any net gain, in goods or godliness, which might be 
set down as having benefited the common run of 
men. 

Perhaps after all, then, the dilemma that dis- 
turbs the church organizations is: by what means 
are we to retain the salutary struggle of industry, 
but still do away with the devastation of the pres- 
ent method of production and distribution? How 
are we to retain competition, but place it on a higher 
plane? 

Fortunately there is a middle course, a course 
peculiarly in keeping with the teachings and tradi- 
tions of the Christian Church. The devotion and 
sacrifices of its own missionaries have ample demon- 
strated that the desire to give, not to get the 
Christian motive, in short calls forth easily the 
finest type of mind and spirit to fight and compete, 
always for the opportunity to serve. 

If the Church will take this lead, if it will act 
on its own teachings, it will be on bed-rock. Not 
even the most reactionary of its members would 



dare openly to assail it for preaching that to serve 
one's fellow men is the highest good; and that the 
kingdom of heaven on earth will not come until all 
effort, including that required in business and indus- 
try, is turned to the service of society. The Church 
may momentarily lose several million dollars 
through the quiet defection of the reactionaries, but 
the millions of new believers in a revitalized church 
will be over-compensation. 

And if the Church does decide to stand by its 
own teachings, what then? How is it to make 
clear to every one the idiocy of a system which dis- 
torts life and makes a scrap of paper of the Gospels ? 
Can it be done by preachments ? Can it be done 
simply by making more evident that which is 
already evident, and has been evident for ages? 

It does not seem possible. Preaching so far has 
been imperceptibly effective. And the libraries are 
full of statistics showing that so many millions of 
men support families on $700 a year, when decency 
cannot be reached with less than three times that 
sum. There are tabulations without number which 
tell of the injury and death of men who work in 
the mines and about machinery, and whose lives 
are a mixture of want and bitterness. There are 
books without end devoted to the human necessity 
of the dignity of labor, yet most of our manufac- 
turers fight even "company unions" for fear that 
labor might acquire a standing which would make 
its voice heard in the community. There are many 
organizations, furthermore, devoted to making a 
hard life easier, but not one whose purpose it is to 
make a hard life impossible. Is the Church to 
carry on in industry as if we had never drained 
swamps to prevent malaria, or built sewers, or puri- 
fied our water supplies? 

The Church must know, or it can find out, that 
modern society has sources of knowledge and equip- 
ment which would make it ridiculously easy to 
supply every one with far more than the bare neces- 
sities of a decent life. There is no difficulty in 
demonstrating that a unit of human effort and skill 
can produce today at least a hundred times as much 
as was possible a hundred years ago. Still one 
would not be far from the truth in maintaining that 
the average man is not even ten times better off, 
nor is he appreciably happier, than he was a cen- 
tury ago. If the men at the head of the various 
church movements do not know this, they might 
find it out. There are men in their own churches 
who do know. 

Now since all this is fact, tested fact, it would 
seem to furnish a sufficient cause for action. A 
realization of at least part of it lies deep in the 
minds of many others besides those churchmen who 



i86

so sincerely desire a radical change in the basis of 
social action and responsibility. But its truth alone 
will not make it adequate as ammunition in the 
actual fight which the Church may have to wage. 
The admittedly enormous productivity of the 
machine industries is no more vital or active a fact 
than the equal truth that men are underpaid, are 
needlessly injured at their machines, and are denied 
the dignity of their position as producers. 

What the Church should have as ammunition is 
the facts of why and how such a state of apparently 
reckless disorganization exists. It must go deeper 
than effects. It must seek out causes. The symp- 
toms have been known for ages. What the Church 
organizations need is an industrial pathologist, or 
a doctor of social medicine. This is no job for 
amateurs, nor for mere humanitarians. A desire 
to revitalize the Church and a deep sympathy for 
the downtrodden perhaps has furnished the stimulus 
to action, and from the ranks of the desirous and 
sympathetic may be drawn some whose powers as 
orators and advocates will be in good place when 
the facts have been collected and put in form. But 
to entrust the work of research to men and women 
in whom sensitiveness to conditions is more pro- 
nounced than scientific attitude and training, is like 
entrusting at surgical operation to the hands of the 
merely sympathetic amateur. 

After all, at this particular moment it is ignor- 
ance rather than selfishness with which the Church 
will have to contend. Those who benefit from 
the present order, like those who most deeply 
mourn the untoward results of things as they work 
out, are not aware of the reason why there is not 
enough for all. Those who mourn think in terms 
of a greater softness on the part of those who bene- 
fit and those who benefit fear lest a greater softness 
will mean disaster for society as well as suffering 
for their own. 

Certainly the force with which the Church must 
contend is, in the greater part, ignorance rather 
than selfishness. If it were selfishness, if men were 
basically selfish, at bottom untouched by the suffer- 
ing of others, there would be less, decidedly less, 
chance for success. But if, as seems most likely, 



the reason for the state in which civilization finds 
itself springs from the common ignorance as to 
why the machine industries are so ineffectual a 
weapon against a nearly implacable nature, all that 
is needed is a better common understanding. 

The imagination of the community would be 
stirred by a plain demonstration of the potential 
productivity of the machine industries, coupled with 
an explanation of why human effort and skill show 
such meager results in comfort and happiness for 
the masses. As a nation we will disallow this stupid 
fight between business men, for we .will see that it 
is carried on at our expense, and that even the 
victors in this guerilla warfare do not really benefit 
in the end. The essential brutality of it all will 
force us, in revolt, to seek another basis of life. Its 
sheer senselessness would affect even the most hard- 
ened believer in the state of things as they are. 

The world, through a billion mouths, has issued 
its challenge to the forces of civilization. The Chris- 
tian Church has. heard, and has accepted the chal- 
lenge. A noble gesture, that of the churches and 
their organizations. It meant a nearly complete 
break with the past. 

But will the churches see clearly the nature of 
the fight? Will its leaders interpret the teachings 
of Christ in terms of this day setting aside special 
pleading in favor of scientific exposition? Will it 
search out the facts and study them, or will it call 
numberless conferences on the state of society and 
then decide, on the basis of the weightiest advocacy, 
to lend its support to this or that opinion and belief? 
Will it prove its 

Doctrine orthodox 
By apostolic blows and knocks? 

The churches alone can do this work. On trie 
success with which it is carried out will depend the 
fate of our western civilization, the fate of Chris- 
tendom indeed, the permanence or extinction of 
the Christian Church as an institution. For if we 
are to believe the evidence of history, revolutions 
of the conventionally bitter sort are scant respecters 
of those institutions which held strength under 

previous dispensations.

Can Real Wages Be Raised? 



T WAS ONE of the postulates of classic economists 
that the masses of the people were doomed forever 
to an income so small that they must always be 
on the verge of starvation ; and that if any increase 
in their real income should perchance come to their 
lot, it would immediately be taken up by an increase 
in the population. In this way, they arrived at the 
iron law of wages, which stated that wages must 
always be just enough for a bare existence. Mod- 
ern thought, especially among industrial workers, 
proceeds on an entirely different assumption. It 
views income as indefinitely expansible, and already 
capable of supporting the great bulk of the popu- 
lation in a degree of comfort undreamed of by 
former generations. Apart from labor's demand for 
a voice in the management of industry, it demands 
an increased share in the fruits of production with 
a view to obtaining for everyone at least an approxi- 
mation of the comfort hitherto attained only by the 
few. As one labor leader put it, when he was 
asked by his employer what he was really after: 
"W : hat we want is to live more the way you do." 

Putting aside entirely any question of innate jus- 
tice involved in this new attitude, how far is it 
capable of realization? Is the actual income of the 
country sufficiently large to meet the demand for real 
comfort on the part of practically all of its citizens? 
Or must the great bulk of our citizens continue to 
struggle along on the verge of starvation, owing to 
an actual deficiency of the goods necessary to supply 
any higher level of existence? 

We have heard much of the increased produc- 
tivity of industry, but until the war forced us to 
make inventories of our strength and resources, we 
have never viewed our problems in their national 
aspect. It has been one of the corollaries of our in- 
dividualistic philosophy that our central thought has 
turned on keeping open the door for private injtia- 
tive and personal attainment without delving too 
deeply into the trend of national affairs. Our as- 
sumption that each individual, if given a free 
chance, would attain an economic status compatible 
with his ability, had a broad foundation in fact and 
experience during the days of free land on ' the 
frontiers. But the change in our economic and so- 
cial point of view which has slowly been growing 
into our lives during the past twenty-five years has 
been tremendously accentuated by the solidarity 
brought about through the war. The basis of esti- 
mates has become national ; inventories of our man- 
hood, our power to bear taxation, and our produc- 
tive capacity, became necessary. From a vague con- 
tion of our country as boundless in expanse and 



wealth, we have become acutely, conscious of our 
limits. In many fields, we have fairly accurate 
knowledge of these limits, and have tested our 
power to increase them ; in other fields we are 'still 
groping. What are our limits in supplying comfort 
to our citizens? 

It is a misfortune that wealth and income are 
susceptible to measurement only in terms of money; 
for in this way, a false identity between them is 
apt to becloud our understanding of the problems 
involved. Moreover, money itself is not a final 
measure, for with changes in prices, the yardstick 
itself shr?nks or grows. In recent years, we 'have 
become accustomed to a progressive shrinkage. 
This defect may in large measure be offset by use 
of the index number of prices of the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, and checked up by similar compu- 
tations. The national income, in addition, varies 
on the whole as individual incomes vary; it is large 
in periods of great industrial activity, and small 
when production is curtailed. The study of any 
one year in consequence, especially if that be a year 
of war, must be applied with great caution as a 
guide for the future. ' v 

It is often said that a rise in wages is inevitably 
taken up by a corresponding increase in prices, and 
that all agitations for higher wages are hence use- 
less. There is just enough truth in this assertion 
to make it appear plausible, and yet the theory that 
one offsets the other is not susceptible of deep prob- 
ing. Changes in wages and prices are particular 
changes, and whik they affect and condition such 
generalities as rates of wages and price levels, they 
d6 not maintain a constant relationship. What a 
rise in wages really implies, is an increase of eco- 
nomic goods to the wage earners; and if these 
goods exist in sufficiently large quantities to meet 
an increased demand, a rise in prices will not result. 
Given the existence of goods, it is possible that real 
wages may increase. 

The basis of all income studies is the estimate 
made by Professor King of $30,500,000,000 in 
1910. This figure has undergone keen scrutiny by 
many critics, and may on the whole be accepted as 
accurate. By applying a correction based on the 
price level and the physical production, to this 
amount, Dr. Anderson arrived at the amounts for 
the national income in succeeding years: 



1910 .

The last figure is less convincing than the others, 
sinqe the basis, railway gross earnings, ceased to be a 
correct standard, and thus rendered comparisons 
difficult. That the facts are in the main cor- 
rect, is confirmed by the estimate made by the 
Bankers Trust Company for 1916 of $50,000,000,- 
ooo and that made by Dr. David Friday for 1917 
of $65,500,000,000. If we accept the gross earn- 
ings of railroads as a just measurement for the 
physical production, and reduce the income of each 
year to the 1918 price level and the 1918 popula- 
tion, the average income for a period of eight years 
is $72,250,000,000. This figure is therefore a 
normal one with the exception of the price level 
element, and may be used so long as all other figures 
jire based on the same level of prices.

The average income per person, $349, is equiva- 
lent to $685, at the 1918 price level, or $72,250,- 
000,000 for the total population of 105,500,000. 
It compares so closely with Dr. Anderson's 
figure for that year, and Dr. Friday's esti- 
mate of above 70 billions, that it may be accepted 
as the basis for further examination. 

How is this sum divided? And by how much 
does it exceed the minimum of existence and the 
minimum of comfort? It is the surplus above these 
amounts which is the bone of contention in any 
discussion of the distribution of wealth, and which 
labor has in mind when it demands an increase in 
wages, and a more equitable distribution of wealth. 
It may be arrived at in either of two ways: first, 
by estimating the minimum of existence, and sub- 
tracting it from the total income of 72 billion dol- 
lars ; and second, by adding together the known sur- 
pluses, and comparing the results. 

The number of heads of families may be esti- 
mated at 23,066,000. The investigations of the 
United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dr. 
Ogburn of the War Labor Board indicated that in 
the summer of 1918 the minimum cost of existence 
for a family of five was about $1380 per year; re- 
ducing this to the basis of 4^, $1250 probably 
represents the minimum; and $29,000,000,000 may 
therefore be taken as the smallest amount on which 
the present population of the United States can 
survive. At the same time, $1760 was found as the 



minimum of comfort for life in a large eastern city. 
Taking this figure for what it is worth, the na- 
tional minimum on this basis would be about $40,- 
500,000,000. If these sums be substracted from 
the estimated national income of 70 billions, then 
there is a surplus of income roughly equal to 
that necessary for existence. And even if the stand- 
ard of minimum comfort were attained by every 
one, there would still be a large surplus left, 
amounting to some 30 billions. 

The most recent complete figures we have for 
incomes are those for 1916. In that year, the. in- 
comes which were reported above $3000 amounted 
to $6,298,000,000 ; and corporate incomes amounted 
to $8,766 millions. Subtracting the duplications 
of $2136 millions leaves a total income of $12,828 
million, to which should be added a round $5 
billion .to represent the $2OOO-$3OOO class, of 
whom there were 2,400,000 in 1917 : and which 
were not reported in 1916. We had then in 1916 a 
surplus income of about 18 billions about which 
enough is known to make an estimate. Un- 
doubtedly, it should be somewhat larger than this, 
since all incomes are not reported, but the amount 
is pure guesswork. 

Expenses for government for 1916 were as follows: 

Federal $1,048 million 

State 505 

City 1,043 

County (estimated) 480 



Total $3,076 million 

On account of the enormously increased expenses 
of the Federal Government, as well as the normal 
increases of the local governments, we can look for 
this ' item to be between 6 and 7 billions in the 
future. 

Putting together such data as we have, the normal 
distribution of income at the 1918 price level, may 
be surmised to be something like the following: 



16 million families receiving the minimum of 

subsistence 

4 million families receiving between minimum 

and $2,000 

2^2 million families receiving between $2,000 

and $3,000 

660,000 families receiving over $3,000

During the war, savings were diverted to the 
payment for Liberty bonds and other known items, 
so that it is possible to check up these estimates. 
War expenses amounted to $15,500,000,000; gov- 
ernment loans to our allies to another $8,500,000,- 
OOO, and in addition there was an annual trade bal- 



1919 



THE DIAL

ance of some 3 billions, making a total of about 16 
billions per year. In addition, there were issued in- 
dustrial and railroad securities amounting to nearly 
$1,500,000,000 per year, state and local bonds of 
about another half a billion, and agricultural sav- 
ings which may be estimated at about three to four 
billions. Since a large part of the latter was taken 
up in Liberty loans, this should probably be re- 
duced to 2 billions. The total known savings were 
therefore in the neighborhood of 20 billions; and 
enough is known of other items to make one sure 
that this figure is a conservative one. In corrobora- 
tion of this, it is interesting to note that Dr. Friday 
estimates the surplus for 1918 at 22 billions. 

We conclude, therefore, that the normal national 
income at present is sufficiently large to permit of 
a surplus above the lowest level of existence of at 
least twenty billions; and we venture the guess 
that it is somewhere between 25 and 30 billions. 
That is to say, the surplus is between one-third and 
one-half of the total income. 

What guidance can be drawn from these facts 
in regard to our future policy? Clearly the doc- 
trine of subsistence wages cannot hold under any 
such large surplus; nor can its modern counterpart 
that any increase in wages must necessarily result in 
a rise in prices which will leave the status quo where 
it was before. Whatever fault there may be with 
the economic order of today, it is not in the produc- 
tion end, for the annual income is immense beyond 
a former generation's wildest dreams. Improve- 
ments can undoubtedly be made. The fact that our 
production was maintained during 1917 and 1918, 
with from two to four million men in the army sug- 
gests that the unutilized forces of previous years 
were considerable. The unemployment of our 
workers or capital serves equally to reduce the na- 
tional income when measured in terms of goods. 
Competitive wastes in the coal mining, lumber, and 
oil industries have been officially reported. A re- 
duction of twenty per cent, of our manufacturing 
output would go far towards wiping out the sur- 
plus available for distribution. On the other hand, 
a similar increase would greatly enlarge the sum. 
Aside from an extension of public ownership and 
cooperative production and distribution, the most 
hopeful element in the maintenance of production 
is the safeguarding of the spirit of enterprise upon 
which the present economic order is founded. As 
long as business men work for profit, they must 
have reasonable assurance of such profits. Fear of 
loss is as powerful a deterrent to production as the 
hope of gain is a stimulant. An increased knowl- 
edge of the facts, such as has been supplied by the 
War Trade Board, is an essential factor in the 
situation, and will do much to keep production at 



the maximum. In certain industries, cooperation 
is a safeguard against loss, and there are instances 
in which combination under government control 
serves to stimulate production. 

But while profits are essential to maintain and 
increase production, they fail of their purpose when 
they are earned without accomplishing this result; 
and they likewise fail when the profits are measur- 
ably out of proportion to the social benefit gained. 
It is the widespread feeling that such is the case at 
present which is the basis of the outcry against 
profiteering. A decade ago it had its counterpart 
in the blind hatred for the trusts. That there is 
a reality at the bottom of this sentiment is but too 
clearly proven in the records of the Federal Trade 
Commission ; and at times it appears to nullify all 
the benefits of the profit system, and lead those who 
hope for improvement in despair into the ranks of 
socialism. But despite the undoubted attractions 
of their program, it must require an undaunted 
courage to have the temerity to hope for an increased 
production over that of which capitalism has given 
proof. Only the most overwhelming proof could 
justify a far-reaching change in our methods of pro- 
duction in the face of the tremendous wealth which 
capitalism annually brings forth. 

It is in the distribution of income that the capi- 
talistic regime has most signally failed. That a 
country with so large a surplus should still leave 
the vast majority of laborers on the verge of star- 
vation must appear uncalled for, particularly in 
view of the fact that during the war, with all its 
accompanying wastage, labor, on the whole was as 
highly paid as at any previous time. The proposi- 
tion that real wages must be reduced just at the mo- 
ment when this wastage is ended must cause one to 
pause and consider. It is said that future produc- 
tion depends on the reinvestment of present savings, 
and that the expenses of the war were paid by sacri- 
ficing these savings. In the main, this is borne out 
by the facts. Dr. Friday has shown that the issue 
of new industrial securities, state and municipal 
bonds, and corporate surplus all fell to about one- 
half of their normal level. But the crux of the 
matter is reached when it is asked to whom the 
future production brought about by the investment 
of savings would accrue. If it is still to leave the 
surplus in the hands of the 665,000 income tax 
payers, while the twenty million remain in the 
same hand-to-mouth condition, then the savings are 
scarcely worth while. On the other hand, if a part 
of the surplus were diverted to the 20 million 
it would greatly increase their capacity to save. To 
be concrete, one-half of the smallest estimate of our 
surplus is $10,000,000,000, or an average of $500 
for every family in the country ; that is, sufficient to

raise them to the minimum of comfort. In all prob- 
ability, this would not all go to increasing the con- 
sumption, although what part of it would be in- 
vested there is no way of estimating. Even a 
smaller sum would lift all families above the sub- 
sistence level. There is a wide leeway for experi- 
mentation without removing the stimulus for profit 
from the more enterprising and capable, who may 
be represented by the 665,000 taxpayers. 

How can such a redistribution take place with- 
out affecting the volume of production? That is 
the real question to be solved, if the advantages of 
the present social order are to be stabilized and 
maintained against the possibility of revolution. 
The ways in which 'not to do it are clearer than 
the positive methods. It cannot be done through 
the reduction of output which may result from low- 



ering the speed of. work; it cannot be done by 
means of sabotage or a general strike; and it can- 
not be done by capitalistic or other combinations 
which reduce the output in order to raise prices. 
The first step to ensure the distribution of the sur- 
plus is the continued creation of the surplus and 
this means physical product. 

Many intelligent suggestions are before the 
public, and experiment is the order of the day. It 
will probably be accomplished by pressure from 
numerous sources an increase of taxes on wealth 
and inheritance, profit sharing, minimum wages, 
shop committees, and unions. The object of this 
analysis is to point out that the hope of a contented 
social order has a solid basis of fact behind it, and 
that the attempt to bring about the reality is cap- 
able of success.

WHY READ STORIES? Why write them? Im- 
portant they seem to be. A glance at the formidable 
pages of advertising through which they straggle 
might suggest that upon the short story hangs the 
commercial" welfare of the United States. The 
reader starts the story why he starts at all is a ques- 
tion with interesting answers and follows his 
heroine for perhaps three pages with no obstacles 
except an illustration to be detoured; as he nears 
the point where the heroine first suspects the man 
in the frock coat of being a Bolshevist in disguise, 
cabalistic numbers send him plunging through the 
magazine to find the story a thin trickle in a deep 
canyon of advertising. Frequently the canyon is 
so deep that the eye holds to the story with diffi- 
culty; the scenery is more spectacular. Well, why 
not? Business is important, and business pays more 
for the advertisement than the editor pays for the 
story. If the story itself were held of more import- 
ance, no doubt some scheme of juxtaposition would 
be evolved to make use of the reader's mood. A 
story of a woman stranded on poverty by the death 
of her husband might well wind between insurance 
advertisements. The possibilities are infinite. This 
however is a situation rather than an explanation. 
Aside from this importance reflected upon short 
stories by their commercial utility, a certain vica- 
rious necessity shines upon them from the books 
made out of them and about them. For at least 
a quarter of a century there have been volumes on 
how to write short stories. Recently another type 
of volume has appeared, a sort of sport, bred from 
. those manuals and from magazine stories them- 
selves, useful to run by the side of the manuals. 



The Literary Drug Traffic 



Today's Short Stories Analyzed, by Robert Wilson 
Neal (Oxford University Press), is a collection 
of stories, non-critical except the implied criticism 
in selection, with elaborate and conscientious 
analysis of the technique of each story. Mr. Neal 
prefaces the volume with this- statement : "the 
contes of today are, therefore they deserve appre- 
ciation." Such a basis of judgment is pragmatic 
rather than revealing. The Best Short Stories of 
1918, Edward J. O'Brien's hardy annual (SmalJ 
Maynard), is definitely critical in its selection and 
is free from the elaboration of technical signposts 
put out in the first volume. Mr. O'Brien in his 
preface announces that he has set himself " the task 
of disengaging the essential human qualities in our 
contemporary fiction which when chronicled con- 
scientiously by our literary artists may be called 
criticism of life." He says too that the poetry of 
life seems to him of more spiritual value than its 
prose. His volume, perhaps illustrating that prefer- 
ence of his, should be called The Best Stories of 
1918 As Seen Through Mr. O'Brien's Tempera- 
ment. 

I come back to the two questions: why write 
stories? why read them? The answers to the sec- 
ond query must signify more than any answer to 
the first. They should perhaps include the answer 
to the first. For unless story writing is a form of 
self-indulgence and nothing more, the audience in 
its reasons for reading short stories is a force crea- 
ting those stories. 

On the surface the answers are simple. I read 
to be amused, to be entertained, to forget myself, 
to while away an hour. What then is amusing,

self-obliterating? You might well wonder, if you 
should select a half dozen magazines of wide cir- 
culation, what in the selv r es of the millions of read- 
ers submitted to temporary annihilation of the sort 
provided. What poverty of existence permitted it- 
self for an hour to be covered by such flimsy rags! 
Is it in part the old story of the scullery maid flee- 
ing from the greasy pots of her life into rose-hung 
arbors where Lady Geraldine waits for her lord? 
The reading public of America has largely escaped 
the scullery stage in practical affairs of life at least. 

At the risk of seeming to take with too great 
seriousness the business of magazine fiction, I should 
like to search for an answer to the query, Why 
read stories? in certain considerations of the way 
of life among ordinary folks. There are two great 
ends of life pleasure and reality. We start after 
the first the minute we are born. We are forced 
into some pursuit of the second soon after that 
event. We find early enough that we have an easy 
escape from a world where effort is necessary into 
a soft land of phantasy. Are we dull in school? 
What simpler than to prop up a geography and be- 
hind it drift into a world where schools are for- 
gotten and we are jolly pirates? Do our parents 
misunderstand us? Easy enough to conquer them 
in a death bed scene, where they gather, contrite 
and grief shaken, around us. Are we clumsy or 
homely? A day dream will invest us with the 
graces of the ancient gods. All this with no effort, 
with none of the bruising which would come from 
an attempt to reach a hundredth of the same satis- 
faction in everyday affairs. But when we climb 
into maturity, when we have love affairs with real 
people, when we have our living to make, we have 
to shut ourselves 'sternly out of this pleasant land 
of phantasying. If we don't, we find ourselves 
finally tucked away in an asylum. 

The average human being does come out of his 
day dreams to make love, to tackle his job, to throw 
himself against people, material things, conditions 
in such a way that he effects changes which are 
pleasant to him. He finds that when he affects 
reality as he wishes, he has after all the highest 
kind of pleasure. The trouble is however that all 
this is work that he doesn't always succeed in his 
attempts. He turns then to art in some form as a 
substitute for his childhood's day dreaming. He 
might take to drink for the same reason. He de- 
sires enhancement of his own rather dull life. He 
wishes his near horizons extended. He may wish 
to meet interesting people, to travel to far places, 
to encounter emotions outside the gamut of his own 
experiences. The artist, as an individual highly 
sensitized to values of life and capable of giving 
form to these values, performs this function of 



vicarious day dreaming. He is answering the de- 
mand of the pleasure principle in man. 

But if he is an artist, what he creates, while it 
serves man's pleasure, has at the same time a bond- 
age to reality. It interprets, vivifies, enhances, pro- 
ducing in the man who sought it for his pleasure an 
ability to make his pleasure find its roots in the 
actual ends of life ; removing him from lotus strewn 
shores of infantile islands into the greater beauty 
of finely developed maturity. 

The " happy ending " is a demand so common 
that it needs few words. Is it not again a quality 
of day dreams that they must turn out well? Who 
would wish for a vicarious day dream which failed 
to follow this obvious design? For the happy end- 
ing must be obvious; the hero does make enough 
money to win the heroine; the heroine who has 
fallen under suspicion perhaps she was actually 
caught opening a safe is proven innocent of all 
except the highest motives. We wish life to work 
that way. It doesn't. We recede into the easy re- 
gion of dreams where, as in the good old fairy tales, 
things all come out as they should. 

Is there any objection to raise against this sit- 
uation, any objection, that is, which has a basis other 
than a puritanic insistence upon reality? It may 
be unfair or ridiculous to line up short stories un- 
der any flag of art. The editors do demand a de- 
gree of technical excellence; these day dreams must 
have intricacy beyond the power of the lay imagina- 
tion. Perhaps out of the neatly made plots comes 
to the reader the sense of well-rounded, finished 
life, a sense existence itself can rarely furnish. On 
the whole, the implications seem to be that the world 
is so unhappy a place that it becomes endurable 
only through escape. Stories are then a means of 
heartening humanity, and are thus to be praised in 
degree as they provide the 'day dreams we can not 
compass for ourselves. They are a mild hashish, 
a literary dope with no evil results. 

Note that you must admit two things: first, that 
the world is unendurable, and second, that you can 
find pleasure only in representations of it as you 
thought it should be before you found out how it 
was. Further, you assume that day dreams are not 
habit forming drugs. 

They might not be, if it were not for the tend- 
ency they feed. Here is a tremendous force how- 
ever, working constantly to ease life, not by adjust- 
ment and competent handling, not by understand- 
ing and mastery, but by slipping away, by retreat- 
ing into soft, dark, warm places, by adolescent 
make-believe. Indulgence in the whims of this 
force carries one constantly backward, never for- 
ward. And in the long run, unless one submits 
entirely to this force and becomes the only success-

ful day dreamer, say of the dementia praecox type, 
one grows constantly more wretched through the 
contrast between an unmastered existence and this 
rosy dream world. 

Stories in themselves may not aggravate this 
tendency to such a degree as to force us to consider 
them with profound seriousness. Still, people read 
them; look at the circulation figures of the success- 
ful magazines. If these stories should partake of 
the quality of art, they would share its result. For 
nowhere else perhaps, can there be so powerful a 
combination of man's desire for pleasure and his 
need for comprehension and reality. In fiction you 
have the actual stuff of life, human beings, their 
motives, their feelings, their struggles. 

The editors do recognize this desire for dreams 
fulfilled; they label it the great American weak- 
ness, sentimentalism. As managers of periodicals 
which must please readers in order to pay the edi- 
tors' salaries, and in order to furnish Advertisers 
with a public, they may cater to that weakness as 
willingly as an illicit vender pf " coke " caters to 
another weakness with the same source. Public 
opinion has been trained to hold the business of 
the drug vender dangerous. The business of run- 
ning a magazine is still highly respectable; and the 
editors, because their aim is frankly commercial and 
their existence depends upon financial success, 
escape behind this barrier of necessity. They " give 
the people what they want." They aren't them- 
selves guilty of writing the stories; they only sift 
out from the manuscripts which pour into their 
offices whatever seems their grist. Where then 
does the responsibility rest? Are the writers of the 
stories responsible? 

That brings up the second query: why do people 
write stories? During the last few years I have 
put that query to several hundred people, some of 
whom were writing stories which landed some- 
where, some of whom were writing stories which 
might someday be published, and others who were 
finding out that writing was too much work. Their 
answers fall into a few general divisions. One 
woman to be sure wished to learn how to write 
stories in order to narrate the life of her little 
poodle, which had died. Most of the hundreds how- 
ever had a wider impulse. Some of them are 
women who wish more pocket money. They are 
married, or they are only daughters; they don't 
wish to break the custom of home life. They use 
words ; what easier than to learn their combinations 
and sell them ! Others, both men and women, are 
dissatisfied with their occupations and see maga- 
zines as an Arcadia to which they need only technic 
as an " open sesame." Some are reforming spirits, 
eager to learn how to sugar-coat their messages 



to the world. Rarely is there a person, man or 
woman, who possesses the curious urge toward ex- 
pression in words which will not let him rest, who 
must force into shape his experience of people, or 
reshape imaginatively his own experience. 

There is no doubt, under these surface reasons, 
a deeper, less conscious drive toward self-expression 
in some creative activity. Perhaps you find in 
schools of sculpture or painting or music, students 
who have only that vague drive without the peculiar 
instinct toward expression in form or color or sound. 
I think you find them there far less often than in 
classes of short story writing. The medium in 
which they must work seems more remote from 
their ordinary life; some definite knack must lead 
them into clay or paint. But who doesn't think, 
secretly or openly, that he can write a story! A 
thing made of words about people ; he uses words 
all day long, and he has his own experiences as well 
as those of his friends. There is too another op- 
portunity for day dreaming here. In a story you 
may work out life as you can't in reality. If your 
day dream don't differ too widely from your neigh- 
bor's, and you have industrious patience, you may 
learn a craft of writing and sooner or later find 
yourself part of the editors' grist. 

And so there are classes in short story writing; 
there are correspondence courses for people who find 
the classes inaccessible; there are textbooks on how 
to write; there are collections of stories dissected 
for their mechanism. The purpose of these classes 
and books is to teach the students how to break into 
magazines. Those stories break in which please the 
editors. The stories chosen by the editors are those 
which will satisfy the public craving. The whole 
business is thus reduced to something quite remote 
from art; it becomes a traffic in soothing-syrups. 

Occasionally even through this rigid circle bursts 
a real story, one written because the author wished 
to write it, had to write it a story created and not 
made. Whose is the fault that stones of this qual- 
ity are rare? Not the editors; they are making 
magazines to sell. Not the writers of stories, per- 
haps; it is much easier to make a story than to create 
one, and if a market exists for manufactured wares, 
why not feed it? If there were a desire for stories 
with vitality or humor or beauty or vision or com- 
ment, there might be more of such stories. The 
people who read are a creative force ; the stories they 
read are made in part by them. What can produce 
in the reading public a recognition of the pleasure 
in art as over against the retrogressive satisfaction in 
day dreams? Such recognition is given a good 
story after its appearance ; it needs also to precede 
the appearance as a demand.

Of Mediocrity and Its Excellences 



N THESE UNITED STATES, among the thousands 
who are manufacturing prose fiction, those who 
may rightfully assert their mediocrity 1 are all too 
few. Yes, hordes there are who in their better 
moments might well lament their failure to attain 
that sturdy mediocrity to which they were mani- 
festly ordained. 

Now there is to be no denunciation here and no 
naming of many names. When the stones have 
been cast, one not uncommonly finds that his own 
house has a little glass in its walls. Let us rather 
for the moment consider impassively why so many 
writers of prose fiction are not mediocre; and 
thereby we shall come ever nearer to a discrimina- 
tion between your false mediocrity and your true, 
and to the analysis of the Simon-pure thing itself. 

First of all it is to be noted that mediocrity is in 
the middle register; hence on the nether reaches of 
the scale one will find prose fiction that is beneath 
mediocrity. According to tradition a certain 
notable amount of it was produced in a college that 
required its freshmen at the year's end to make a 
short story. Inept, rebellious, wretched with loath- 
ing, those freshmen, it is said, wrote stories which 
blasted and slew with the chill -of absolute zero in 
fictional merit. Have done with all such ! We 
deal with a better thing true mediocrity. 

Other prose fictions there are too that on the 
scale of extrinsic merit will measure equal to medi- 
ocrity, yet which may not with aptness be called 
mediocre. The popular magazines subsist upon 
them. At worst they are sometimes at their best 
technically; that is, when the plot motive force is 
love o' women svelt creatures that are very mer- 
maids for swimming and that have been given to 
cast aside conventionality and its swathings. There 
is workmanlike laying of words in some of those 
-descriptions. But that which denies these writings 
excellence likewise, in a sense, denies them medi- 
ocrity: there is no sound prompting back of them, 
neither artistic incitement not to be paltered with, 
nor wholesome prosaic conviction. 

It may be that evil men have written these tales 
with lip-licking satisfaction; it may be that God- 
fearing men, fathers whose babes prattle, have 
written them with disgust. No man may say. If 
the fathers ha\ve written them, it is because prat- 
tlers come high and gasoline is as rubies. Let no 
man do more than pity the father who must dwell 
upon the rondures of the cold sea-maiden, upon the 
vagaries of the girl who will investigate for her- 
self, or the wife who unwives herself. His creations 
are harmful, but there are more harmful things 



under the stars. And he doubtless has many quite 
harmless potboilers to his credit, potboilers as 
beneficent as honest mediocrity. 

Such potboilers, in truth, can only regretfully be 
excluded from mediocrity; but they must be ex- 
cluded. Average the potboiler may be, as senti- 
mentally banal as heart could desire; but it is al- 
ways artfully average. This distinction, finical as 
it may seem, must be taken to heart: It has noth- 
ing to do with externals ; it will not solace the dis- 
criminating reader who has fallen upon the Happy 
Ending or Red Blood or the Noble-Hearted Crim- 
inal or Heart Interest or Clean-Cut Heroes or Fine 
Description. It is not a distinction that the critic 
may make with certainty. But it is truth and has 
to do with the well-being of those who write. 

Simon-pure mediocrity then is the best work of 
a mediocre man. While men remain a little below 
the angels, it is inevitable. It is not so excellent 
as excellence; but what would you? It is not to 
be wished away ; it is not a bad habit that the world 
of letters can lay aside by stern exercise of will. 
The lamentable fact remains that all who will write 
and who should write are not touched with genius. 

Mediocrity should be fostered. That is, it should 
be given its just due. It must be told that it is 
mediocrity and it must be shown in just what par- 
ticulars it is not excellence, but it must not be ut- 
terly condemned. It must of course be campaigned 
against; yet even so it may be fostered. The cam- 
-paigners must quite serenely know that mediocrity 
may never be suppressed, and they need but one 
slogan, one homely and platitudinous slogan: let 
each man do his best. 

The mediocrity sorely needs encouragement. His 
is a grievous task, for, if he deserves the title, he 
must ever be trying to stretch up to excellence 
and by the same token never reaching it. This hope- 
ful hopelessness is rare and much to be commended. 
What if a man's novel or short story is a bit feeble 
or maudlin or perfervid. He himself is the better 
for the exercise of his talents, the clearer of thought, 
the more eased of restrained emotion. In truth 
it is his inalienable right to make fiction if he so 
desire and by all odds the best thing he can do. 
True mediocrity writes not entirely for fame or 
emulation or gain. It writes because it is happy 
when it is writing or has just written. What harm 
if a man, especially a man with some trace of talent, 
devise stories for himself? Indeed, what will serve 
the purpose so well! Narrative is largely vicarious 
experience; another man's story is twice removed, 
your own but once.

If I am ugly, feeble, and timorous and shall never 
be otherwise, why should I not to the best of my 
modest ability write myself into a clean-cut hero? 
If I know the houses on my street and the view from 
my trolley windows until I detest each atom of all 
that I pass each day, why may I not gladden my 
eyes with what I take to be Himalayan dawns, or 
why should I not dare many strange and difficult 
lands of Never Never? What if the select few 
do read and run? Let them consort with heroes 
to their own liking, and let them seek the magic 
jasements that grant them wid^r, weirder vistas 
of stranger and more lovely lands. Yes, let them 
construct their own windows or, if none else will 
suffice, create their own heroes. 

And who knows but among those that have read 
and run there may be some who have profited 
withal. Mediocrity is part of the community of 
letters. Though we reckon literary progress by 
names the Age of Dryden, the Age of Tennyson 
though we would not if we could, pore over the 
forgotten works of little men, we should not be 
utterly unaware that they ever wrote. Biographers 
are fond of pointing out what one great man owes 
another, but more rarely do they estimate what 
the big man owes to the little man of his day the 
presentation of a great theme albeit inadequately, 
the stimulation to set right erring popular opinion 
or to voice that opinion as it should be, the very 
incentive that comes from a consciousness of fellow- 
workers, of companionship, however faltering, in a 
high emprize. If all literature worth taking into 
account were among the Hundred Bests, they them- 
selves might perhaps not be so invaluable as they 
are. 

Among the Hundred Bests there is mediocrity. 
No man with the impressionable temperament of 
genius is always sure of himself. Over-driven hob- 
bies, too strong impulsion by the time-spirit, too much 
exposure to the winds of doctrine, have brought 
many a genius to mediocrity and worse. Prose 
fiction particularly slants sharply toward it. Novels 
are made of what usually is in outward form the. 
contemporaneous and thfe transient and are woefully 
susceptible of being written with a purpose. More 
than this, realistic prose fiction, except for the real- 
istic prose romance, is the apotheosis of the com- 
monplace. Of all the stubborn, treacherous ma- 
terial with which the artist must struggle, none is 
worse than the commonplace. It is at once the 
bane and the glory of the novelist and short story 
writer jhat to him is allotted this hard fight. Small 
wonder that 'he wavers now and then. 

There is cause for charitableness in this, but no 
cause for shamefacedness and deprecation. With- 



out the twaddle in Dickens, the loquacity in Thack- 
eray, the endless realism in Tolstoi, we should not 
be so aware of the man behind the book. And the 
books would be thereby less the projection of an 
interpretation of life by one who knows whereof he 
speaks. Faultless in execution, the books would be 
the better for all time, but less comforting just now 
to the critic who is not himself a compound of genius 
unalloyed, and less potent for the out and out 
mediocrity who himself writes fiction. 

When all is said, however, the masterpieces of 
fiction are for the few, the works of mediocrity for 
the many. Of the millions of the Man in the Street 
or of the Man on the Country Road, hundreds of 
thousands there are who lead worthy lives with no 
reading of fiction whatever. There are as many 
more, equally valuable to the world, who read 
fiction but not the masterpieces. Some of these 
would read the masterpieces if their fathers before 
them had done so or if some force beyond the family 
circle had trained them to a liking for excellence. 
But there are many readers whom no power of 
man could have brought, even in the most pliant 
days of youth, to know excellence when they see 
it, much less to like it. Mediocre prose fiction is 
for such. 

If a man can not get satisfaction from Under 
Western Eyes, it is well for him if he can get it 
from V V's Eyes or even from Eyes of the World. 
By all means let him try Under Western Eyes, but 
do not declaim against him if it leave him cold and 
weary and if he get a grateful warmth of the heart 
from Eyes of the World. He may be a tired man 
and unfitted by a life of commercial directness for 
Conrad's oblique story-telling. Masterpieces, how- 
ever familiar their diction, have a way of speaking 
in strange or outworn tongues that many an intellr- 
'gent, hard-working man may never hope to com- 
mand. Contemporary prose fiction however, talks 
the language of the street and road for the very 
month and day. And it can warm hearts, never 
fear. For a little price the pages of magazine or 
of novel can grant who i knows what sustaining 
examples of fortitude, what pictures of gentility and 
tenderness, what assuaging of the wanderlust, what 
spacious atmosphere of great deeds for those who 
are stifled with trivialities! 

Honest mediocrity will respond to honest medi- 
ocrity and will draw from it pleasure that is almost 
delight and edification that is almost exaltation. 
There are those for whom Harold Bell Wright and 
E. P. Roe have done all that art can do. 

Heaven grant that Messrs. Wright and Roe be 
true mediocrities, and that there be much even truer 
mediocrity in print. Enough of it there would be-

token the uncommercializing of our fiction and the 
spread, or at least the preparation for the spread, 
of that admirable thing unhappily called Culture. 
Right culture is based on reverence for what is 
artistically sincere, and it calls for ceaseless, sincere 
productive effort. The man who tries to produce 
excellence and fails and knows that he fails sees in 
it thereafter a value that he could not in any other 
way have discovered. 

We need the geniuses, and the world and all 
future generations need them; but it would be well 
for us if we could at this moment boast of more, 
many more, true fictional mediocrities. They more 
surely than the geniuses would denote a soundness 
in the commonality. True culture is not only ven- 
erative but creative, and creative in the man of few- 
talents as in the man of many. 

We might, it is true, spend our tears that literary 
inferiority, like crime and thistles should ever have 
come into the world, that verse fiction has not sur- 



passed prose fiction in popularity, that there are 
those who can never be deeply moved by the master- 
pieces. Such tears are wept. We might insist that 
all men read only the masterpieces, that none but 
the masters write. There are those who do this. 
They may be right, for the 'human race may be ulti- 
mately perfectable. But quite as surely the world 
may end next year, and in the meantime scant good 
be done. If however, we are not tearfully or un- 
compromisingly insistent, we may content ourselves 
with the demand that each man do what he is 
capable of for literary excellence, that at least he 
be made aware of its existence; but we need not 
scornfully wither, nay, we may even hearten with 
commendation, the man who on Sunday afternoon 
peruses in slippered ease the Post that purports to 
appear on Saturday eve ; and we may assert stoutly 
and without equivocation that very fitly its pages 
should set before him a sufficiency of honest and 

thorough-going mediocrity. ,..

The Economic Aftermath in France and England 



.HE SITUATION in distracted Europe is no more 
settled and seems likely to become even less so in 
the near future. France celebrated the conclusion 
of peace with Germany on July 14 and England 
celebrated it on July 19, but the celebrations in 
London, at any rate, quite lacked the spontaneity 
and enthusiasm of November II, when relief that 
the war was over found its natural expression. 
Now nobody is inclined to rejoice, for everybody 
feels that this peace is no peace, that it does not 
fulfill the conditions of a lasting settlement. More- 
over not only are there still wars going on in Cen- 
tral and Eastern Europe, but every country is torn 
by internal conflicts and civil war is looming on 
the horizon. 

In England the strike of the Yorkshire miners, 
which has been going on for several weeks, is not 
settled (July), and we are faced with the possibil- 
ity of a far more important strike, which might 
easily develop into something like a revolution. 
The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union 
Congress having taken no action on the resolution 
of the Labor Party conference at Southport call- 
ing for " direct action," the Triple Alliance lost 
patience and decided by an overwhelming majority 
to take a ballot of the Unions affiliated to it on 
the question of a general strike against intervention 
in Russia and Hungary either by the supply of men 
or material, against the continuance of conscription, 
and against the use of troops for strike-breaking. 



The threat of the strike has already led to a Gov- 
ernment decision to withdraw all British troops 
from Russia, but the assistance in money and kind 
to Denikin is to be continued and that the Trade 
Unionists will not tolerate. The unions have 
reversed their decision to carry through a refer- 
endum of the membership and have decided to sub- 
mit the question to a conference. Bye-elections 
continue to show that the Government has com- 
pletely lost the confidence of the country. The 
last two were at Swansea in Wales and at Both- 
well in Scotland. In Wales Mr. Lloyd George 
still retains a good deal of his influence and the 
ministerial Coalition held the Swansea seat, but by 
a greatly reduced majority. At Bothwell, where 
the Coalition candidate had a majority of 332 last 
December, the Labor Party won the seat with a 
majority of 7168. It is now clear that not a 
single Coalition seat in Great Britain is really safe. 
Mr. Winston Churchill is to a great extent respon- 
sible for the unpopularity of the Government, which 
he will certainly bring to ruin if he is not checked 
or got rid of; he is a reckless and irresponsible fire- 
brand. In the six bye-elections already held the 
aggregate Coalition poll has decreased by 23,702 
as compared with last December and the aggregate 
poll of the Opposition candidates has increased by 
1 5)329- The polls have been even smaller than 
they were in December even at Bothwell only 
69 per cent of the electors voted although great

numbers of soldiers have been demobilized since 
the general election; this fact is without doubt a 
symptom of indifference to parliamentary action 
and of growing distrust of parliamentary methods. 
The weakness and incompetence of the Labor Party 
in the House of Commons is strengthening anti- 
parliamentarism. 

In France the twenty-four-hour general strike ar- 
ranged as a demonstration against intervention 
in Russia and dear living was abandoned at the 
last moment. The Executive Committee of the 
General Confederation of Labor gave the defeat of 
the Government in the Chamber on July 18 as the 
reason for its climb-down, but in fact the abandon- 
ment of the strike was due to the fear that it would 
not be successful. Many French Trade Union- 
ists including some of the strongest advocates of 
direct action have always been averse to such 
a general strike merely for the purpose of mak- 
ing a demonstration; they hold, with reason, that 
the results obtained are not adequate to the trouble 
and loss occasioned. If they strike, they want to 
strike to some practical purpose. Nevertheless the 
abandonment of the strike at the eleventh hour is 
a severe set-back to the General Confederation of 
Labor and a triumph for M. Clemenceau, who had 
threatened repressive measures. Its first result was 
that the Chamber on July 22 rejected by a large 
majority the identical resolution censuring the eco- 
nomic policy of the Government which it had passed 
on July 1 8 under the threat of the strike. Had 
the strike been held and been successful, the 
Clemenceau Ministry would probably by now have 
been out of office. The bungling tactics of the 
C. G. T. (General Confederation of Labor) have 
given M. Clemenceau a new lease of life and he 
is likely now to remain in office until after the gen- 
eral election, which can hardly take place before 
October. By way of showing his contempt for the 
C.G.T., M. Clemenceau has now refused permis- 
sion to the Italian delegates to the International 
Trade Union Conference at Amsterdam to cross 
France and they have been prevented from attend- 
ing the conference, although they had passports from 
their own Government. The collapse of the 
C.G.T. has also had a. serious repercussion in Italy, 
where the general strike took place on July 21 
according to arrangement and where the defection 
of France is regarded as a slap in the face to Italian 
Socialists and Trade Unionists, who were thus left 
to strike alone. 

At a special meeting of the National Confederal 
Committee of the C.G.T., hastily summoned and 
held on July 21 and 22, M. Jouhaux delivered a 
long speech vindicating the action of the Executive, 



which was approved by the Committee after a 
lively discussion in the course of which the Execu- 
tive was severely criticized. M. Jouhaux's speech 
was mainly composed of empty rhetoric and vague 
generalities and did not carry the matter much 
further. The rank and file of French Trade Union- 
ists have certainly reason . to complain that the 
Executive of the C.G.T. has let them down. It 
should never have announced a general strike 
unless it was sure to be able to carry it out and, 
having announced it, it should have gone through 
with it. The whole business is an example of 
blundering and bad management which augurs ill 
for the leadership of French Trade Unionism. One 
of its worst results will be a further diminution 
of the confidence of Trade Unionists in their lead- 
ers, which w r as already sadly impaired. One of the 
gravest factors in the present Labor situation in 
France is the lack of leadership. Some day or other 
some sectional strike about a purely economic ques- 
tion will suddenly develop into a general revolu- 
tionary movement and, unless there are men ready 
and able to take control of such a movement, the 
consequences may be disastrous for Labor, for it 
may end in nothing but futile violence and 
bloody repression. One does not see at present 
where such men are to be found; the events might, 
of course, produce them, but the present leaders of 
the C.G.T. are not likely to be among them. They 
have not the confidence of the rank and file to a 
sufficient extent to be able to direct them, and they 
are likely, as I said in my last article, to be over- 
whelmed. Never was the loss of Jaures so palpable 
as now. Few leaders in history have had the con- 
fidence of their followers so completely as he had. 
He has no successor. The present leaders of the C.G. 
T. seem to be over-prudent when courage is needed 
and too hasty when the occasion demands prudence. 
The Confederal Committee, however, took a course 
on July 22 which was a new departure in French 
Trade Union policy. By ninety-one votes, against 
sixteen, with eight abstentions, it adopted a resolu- 
tion definitely declaring in favor of Free Trade of 
the suppression of customhouse barriers and the free 
entry into France of raw materials and manufac- 
tured goods from all countries. Until recently the 
question of Free Trade and Protection had been 
almost entirely neglected by French Socialists and 
Trade Unionists, but the appalling cost of living 
has forced it on their attention. During the war 
law after law has been passed ami decree after 
decree has been issued to prevent profiteering, with- 
out the smallest result; prices continued to rise 
and are still rising. At last it dawned upon people 
that one of the causes of high prices is the closing 



THE DIAL 



197 



of the frontiers to foreign products. Economic 
questions, to which little attention was paid in 
France before the war, have now become too 
important to be ignored and the public has dis- 
covered that England is now as ever the cheapest 
country in Europe because England has Free Trade. 
Although Mr. Lloyd George's Government is try- 
ing to foist Protection upon us by a back-door and 
prices here are higher than they ought to be in 
consequence of restriction of imports, the cost of 
living is less than half what it is in France and 
wages are higher than in that country. This dis- 
covery has led to a Free Trade movement among 
the French urban populations, which has grown 
very rapidly and is now formidable. It is further 
strengthened by the growing conviction that uni- 
versal Free Trade is one of the essential conditions 
of permanent peace. The French Socialist papers 
are now all in favor of Free Trade and one 
bourgeois paper of the Left, L'Oeuvre, is making a 
vigorous campaign in favor of the suppression of 
all import duties. 

The opposition to Free Trade will come from 
the agricultural population, which has been up to 
now the spoiled child of the Third Republic. Agri- 
cultural profits are actually exempt from income tax 
and agriculturists are even exempted from the pro- 
visions of the laws against profiteering, which, to 
be sure, are totally ineffective. The rural popula- 
tion, although the constant exodus from the coun*- 
try into the towns has greatly diminished it, is 
still nearly half the population of France. Fear of 
Free Trade on the part of the agriculturists is jus- 
tified to the extent that, with their present obso- 
lete methods, they would hardly be able to compete 
in an open market. The whole system of French 
agriculture needs drastic overhauling and some 
modification of peasant proprietorship has become 
urgently necessary. The peasant proprietor has 
many great qualities, but he is intensely conserva- 
tive and quite out of touch with modern methods; 
moreover, even if he wished to use modern 
machinery, he has not the capital to buy it. The 
system of small isolated production has in fact 
broken down and only complete and extensive coop- 
eration can save French agriculture. The heavy 
losses in the war have made the labor difficulty, 
which was already becoming serious, acute. It 
will not be possible to find sufficient labor to con- 
tinue French agricultural production on the present 
methods. A radical change is necessary in any case ; 
Free Trade would make it immediately necessary. 
The attitude of the agricultural population in 
this regard makes it difficult for any of the 
bourgeois political parties to advocate Free Trade, 



for their electors are now mainly drawn from the 
rural districts. That is the reason why the elec- 
toral manifesto of the Radical Party, which held 
its national congress on July 26 and 27, is so weak 
on the question of dear living. Being chiefly a 
" country party," it dares not mention the first and 
most essential remedy and is obliged to deal in 
vague generalities. But it was more outspoken in 
certain other regards. M. Mandel his real name 
is Rothschild who is M. Clemenceau's Grand 
Vizier and general factotum and who shares with 
M. Loucheur the effective government of France, 
had elaborated a beautiful scheme for combining 
all the bourgeois parties, including Royalists and 
reactionaries, against the Socialists at the corning 
general election. The Royalists hailed the scheme 
with enthusiasm; in the Action Francaise M. 
Maurras declared that he and his friends would 
accept any and every alliance against " Bolsheviks 
and Caillautists." One of the objects of the pro- 
posed coalition is reported to be the election of 
M. Clemenceau to the Presidency of the Republic 
next January in succession to M. Poincare, whose 
term of office will then expire. 

The proceedings at the Radical Congress, how- 
ever, show that all bourgeois Republicans are not 
prepared to fall in with M. Mandel's ingenious 
arrangements. It also showed a sharp cleavage of 
opinion between the rank and file of the party, and 
the majority of the Radical deputies, who support 
the Clemenceau Ministry. In spite of the opposi- 
tion of M. Rene Renoult, chairman of the Radical 
party in the Chamber, whom M. Clemenceau is 
believed to have designated as his successor in the 
Premiership, the Congress adopted by an over- 
whelming majority a resolution formally instruct- 
ing the Radical deputies to " exact " from the Gov- 
ernment the immediate suppression of martial law 
and the censorship and to give their support only 
to a Government " realizing the union of Repub- 
licans," that is to say, to refuse it to the Govern- 
ment of M. Clemenceau. It remains to be seen 
whether the Radical deputies will fall into line; 
if they do, the days of the Clemenceau Ministry 
are numbered, but I am inclined to think that they 
will not, or at any rate that a sufficient number 
will continue to support the Government to keep 
it in power until the general election. The Con- 
gress also passed unanimously a second resolution 
declaring its readiness " to facilitate the union of 
all the parties of the Left " a phrase which 
includes the Socialists and its decision to " repu- 
diate any elected representative or candidate who 
"may consent to figure on the same list as those that 
have incessantly combated the laical, democratic}

and social Republic." This is the end, so far as 
the Radical party is concerned, of M. Mandel's 
scheme; and the Radical party is at present the 
largest political party in France, numbering about 
one-third of the Chamber. 

Public opinion has at last compelled M. Loucheur 
to modify his economic policy. Most of the pro- 
hibitions of imports have been withdrawn and the 
proposed supplementary ad valorem duties have 
been abandoned, but the existing import duties are 
to be increased in some cases trebled so that 
there is no immediate prospect of a fall in prices. 
M. Loucheur has also been obliged to give way in 
regard to the surplus material of the American 
army, which the French Government has now 
bought on terms very favorable to it. Previously 
M. Loucheur had refused to buy any part of it 
or to allow anybody else to buy it and had even 
forbidden the American authorities to give any- 
thing away. The press campaign, especially in 
L'Oeuvre and L'Humanite, against M. Loucheur's 
fondness for the profiteers is thus beginning to have 
an effect. Mr. Henry Ford must have some credit 



in the matter. It is probably known in America 
that, when the Armistice was declared, a large 
number of Ford motorcars bought by the French 
Government were in the port of Bordeaux, where 
they have since been left to rust to oblige the 
French motorcar manufacturers. Mr. Ford of- 
fered to pay the ad valorem import duty of 70 
per cent on these cars and then sell them to the 
French public at the price at which he had sold 
them to the French Government when he had no 
import duty to pay. Although this proposal would 
have meant that the French Government recovered 
the whole cost of the cars with 70 per cent of their 
value in addition, M. Loucheur refused it and 
M. Ford published the facts in the French press. 
The Citroen company replied with an advertise- 
ment telling the public not to bother itself about 
foreign cars, for there would soon be plenty of 
French cars on the market a promise not yet ful- 
filled. Mr. Ford retorted with full particulars 
of M. Loucheur's interests in the Citroen company.

Russia and International Economics 



BUFFERING FROM MANY economic and indus- 
trial troubles the world (even the world of indus- 
trialists and financiers) seems to have forgotten what 
is perhaps the main cause of this basic malaise. The 
destruction of many values as a result of the war is 
an unescapable fact and the restoration of sound in- 
ternational economic conditions has been hindered 
not only by the curtailment of production but by the 
absence of Russia from the world market and its 
economic interaction. 

From this point of view the present-day state of 
affairs in Russia acquires more than a political, or 
even a humanistic interest, it becomes a matter of 
practical economic importance. Russia's industrial 
strength is now lower than that of any other period. 
During the years of the war her export was closed. 
Many provisions remained unused, and are rotting 
on the fields of Russia; and her unmeasurable raw 
materials are out of the world market. This state 
of affairs has produced fatal international complica- 
tions with worldwide political implications. 

The coal difficulties in England, the desperately 
pessimistic speech of Lloyd George, the labor unrest 
in Italy and in France and even in the richest of 
countries, in America, show irrefutably that without 
the aid of Lenin and Communism the economic and 
industrial organizations of the contemporary state 
are half destroyed. And under such serious circum- 



stances Russia, which is able to provide the world 
with sufficient raw materials to feed the mills and 
factories of many industries, is eliminated. The 
Russian cooperative societies have many times em- 
phasized that trade and economic intercourse with 
Russia is possible regardless of the political contro- 
versies and governmental crises in that country. 
While all kinds of economic organizations have been 
destroyed throughout Russia, in Central Russia as 
well as Siberia, the cooperative societies have alone 
remained intact and have become powerful as never 
before. There were several attempts from this 
quarter to show to the Allies that neither from the 
political nor from the economic point of view could 
the blockade wisely be maintained. On February 
20, 1919, a special memorandum was presented to 
the English government by the representative of the 
All-Russian Cooperative Union. It pointed out in 
part: 

The absence of exchange of goods is causing heavy 
material losses to the commerce and industry of the whole 
world. As a matter of fact, the notion that nothing is to 
be had from Russia and that she can be treated only as 
an object of relief is a quite mistaken one. During the 
last five years the absence of our export trade and ex- 
change of goods within the country has brought about an 
accumulation in the hands of the peasantry of huge re- 
serves of raw material, grain, eggs . . . hides, flax, and 
so forth. The raising of the blockade and the re-estab- 
lishment of an exchange of commodities will bring on the 



1919 



THE DIAL 



199 



market an enormous quantity of raw materials of which 
the world stands in such great need at present. 

The same memorandum states further that the 
reopening of trade through the cooperatives is pos- 
sible independently of the Soviet Government, be- 
cause they are now the only agent of distribution 
and are ready to complete it even under the control 
of the representatives of the Allies, guaranteeing 
that this distribution will be made among all the 
population regardless of class. Moreover, the lift- 
ing of the blockade and the opening of trade is bound 
to restore the normal habits of the nation in economic 
intercourse, which are now suppressed by the policy 
of the Allies. No answer followed this memoran- 
dum. The peace treaty is now signed and the fea- 
tures of Europe, at least those of the next few years, 
begin to be defined. The European countries, and 
especially England, look for the Russian market. 
And in this respect the economic policy of the Allies 
toward Russia seems very shortsighted. England is 
interested in the Russian market, but her interests 
have peculiar commercial limitations. She fears the 
power of the cooperatives, and has to weaken them 
in order to colonize Russia. In my article in THE 
DIAL for August 9, 1919, I mentioned an attemp 1 * 
in England to organize a special supply company 
akin to the East Indian Supply Company for a 
monopolized exploitation of Russia. 

Involving political controversies England finds 
support in the representatives of former Russian 
bankers and big business men who are interested 
in salvaging their own investments their capital 
having been largely transferred from Russia to 
English banks. Thus under the banner of 
patriotism all kinds of Economic Leagues have been 
organized, and these are closely in touch with the 
British Government. 

On the other hand, Russia cannot remain any 
\onger without exchange and manufactured articles. 
It is evident that Germany is the next possibility. 
Trying to make people afraid of " pro-German- 
ism " the Allies as a matter of fact are only em- 
phasizing their own creation. Both Germany and 
Russia are driven to this rapprochement by the 
arrangement of the European balance. 

In this respect the attitude of the United States 
can . hardly be understood ; for two processes are 
now in operation: I. Pushing Russia into an al- 
liance with Germany. 2. Eliminating America 
. from the Russian market. A significant fact was 
pointed out to me by Mr. A. M. Orloff, Engineer- 
agriculturist manager of the Odessa Credit Union, 
and member of a cooperative union mission that 
lately visited Italy and England. Before the war 
Russia received agricultural machinery only from 



America. After Brest-Litovsk some machinery was 
received from Sweden through Germany. But it 
was not satisfactory. With agricultural machinery 
it is impossible to shoot or destroy. Nevertheless 
America with the Allies does not allow it to be im- 
ported into Russia. At the same time England, 
which never had more than one or two big factories 
producing for export has now about ten, and there 
is reason to believe that the great munition fac- 
tories were turned into agricultural machinery 
works in order to get hold of the Russian market 
as soon as possible and push out the former Ameri- 
can influence. The political undertaking by Eng- 
land of a military intervention is nothing else there- 
fore than the realization of a program of economic 
imperialism. On the other hand after the revolu- 
tion Russia became a country of small landowner- 
ship. A small landowner is not in a position to 
purchase large machinery by himself, and conse- 
quently the local cooperative society buys the equip- 
ment and rents to the members. This explains the 
fact that in South Russia for instance 75 per cent 
of the rural population is participating in the co- 
operative movement. The policy of destruction of 
the cooperative societies is thus a policy in favor of 
the big landowners and therefore in Siberia, for 
instance, where influence of England is very strong, 
Mr. Anatoly Gan in the Russian Economist for 
May 5, 1919, assails the cooperative societies, and 
the government of Kolchak is treating them very 
badly as shown in my article for August 9. Even 
their paper, Zaria, so often quoted even by- 
Struggling Russia, is now suppressed. More than 
that, a strong spirit of enmity against America has 
been cultivated and the same Anatoly Gan on one 
hand, and the Siberian merchants on the other, are 
all the time manifesting their sympathy with Eng- 
land. A resolution against America was passed 
at the conference of merchants of Vladivostok 
(Golos Primoria. June 12-13, 1919). In th^ 
meantime an international realignment is being per- 
fected. On one side England, France, and the 
United States; on the other Russia, Germany, and 
Japan. Japan has already declared her unwilling- 
ness to send troops to aid Kolchak, while support- 
ing all the time Kalmikov and Semenov as pro- 
Japanese rulers. An economic alliance of Russia 
with Germany and an understanding if not an 
alliance with Japan, after granting certain ad- 
vantages in Manchuria and Siberia, would be 
a tragic crown to the war to end war. Sup- 
pressed and offended Germany, disintegrated Rus- 
sia, aggressive Japan, will present a strong in- 
centive to war in the near future, because 
the thorough exploitation of Russia's rich possi- 



200 



THE DIAL 



September 6 



bilities will make up for the losses of the last five 
years and for those exacted by the peace treaty. 
England will not be able then (as she was during 
the last war) to keep India safe or to blockade 
Germany. Japan and Russia will open the way 
for supplies, and can possibly threaten the in- 
tegrity of the Indian Empire. 

Great Britain's " agreement " with Persia will 
hardly remove this danger. Thus the present 
economic policy toward Russia carries first of all 
the bitter promise of a future war. These are, by 
the way, the views expressed in the memorandum 
presented to the State Department of the United 
States on March 20 and on August 7, 1919, by the 
Representative of the Russian Cooperative Societies, 
A. M. Berkenheim. No official answer followed. 

It has to be emphasized that Russia (the post- 
revolutionary Russia from Kerensky to Lenin in- 
clusive) was always opposed to the domination of 
European capital and inclined to welcome the pene- 
tration of America in the Russian market, since 
America is so far away that her capital and products 
enter the field without any political or diplomatic 
strings. 

On March 2O Mr. Berkenheim wrote to the 
State Department: 

There is no financial risk involved in this transaction, 
because the Cooperative Unions are ready to pay for all 
the merchandise that will pass through their hands. 

The Cooperative; Union will distribute the supplies di- 
rectly and only to the population, and if so desired will 
carry on their work under the eyes of the American 
representatives. It is confidently expected that in view of 
unbearable economic stress it would not be difficult to 
effect the necessary agreement and obtain requisite guar- 
antees. 

And on August 7 the Cooperatives declared 
themselves ready to guarantee that no part of the 
goods should be used for military purposes. 

America's attitude could be to a certain degree 
understood if these attempts to reopen the market 
had nQt taken place. -But otherwise, from the 
point of view of America's own interest, her de- 
pendence upon London and Paris is incomprehen- 
sible, since the policy of the latter two centers 
brings America only the loss of Russia as a market 
and the opportunity to participate in a new war. 

I have not touched upon the human side of 
the question because it seems to me that a realistic 
practical analysis is fundamental to an understand- 
ing. But I cannot help calling attention to the 
following fact of purely psychological character. 
After the peace of Brest-Litovsk a great number 
of German agents, military and civil, came to 
Russia in order to buy the raw materials exhausted 
Germany needed, especially fats, in which Russia 
is very rich and from which explosives are derived. 



The cooperative societies through their agent 
bought throughout Russia the entire supply of fats, 
so that Germany was unable to get a gramme of it. 
It was an act of great importance in this war. But 
what Russia did by herself against the Germany of 
the Kaiser, with whom she was officially at peace, 
Russia surrounded by the iron link of the Allies 
will hardly do against the Germany of President 
Ebert, when her faith in the Allies is lost. That is 
why psychologically Russia is united in opposition 
to foreign forces and new governments despite the 
fact that many are discontented with the Soviet 
Regime. I just received a message from an old 
social worker, my colleague in the Ministry of 
Labor under Kerensky, G. D. Krasinsky, describ- 
ing the terrible conditions in Russia starvation, 
illness, and disaster and criticising strongly, the 
Moscow Government. But he adds: "And 
despite all which is strange we feel more and 
more that the spirit of defense is growing in us." 
This spirit makes Russia strong against Kolchak 
and Denikin, but winder the circumstances it will 
bring about more international complications than 
even the spread of Sovietism through half of Europe. 
If England or France does not see the forest be- 
cause of the trees their purely egoistical aspira- 
tions why then does America not open her eyes? 
In a memorandum, of August 6, 1919, we read: 

1. Neither American financial nor trade circles have 
taken any steps toward the establishment of even pre- 
liminary requirements for the organization of permanent 
commercial relations with Russia. 

2. No advance has been made toward the execution of 
the plan advocated by us during five months to foster 
the economic life of Central Russia, by means of re- 
storing the exchange of goods through cooperative chan- 
nels. 

3. Judging from the information in our hands at the 
present time, representatives of German firms have ap- 
peared in all Russian markets especially in Novorossiys 
and Vladivostok, not to mention Central Russia, and are 
offering in large quantities goods of German manufacture 
upon the normal conditions of peace-time credit and the 
pre-war basis of trade exchange. 

4. In the Far East a similar position is taken by Japan. 

The conclusion is that the United States is losing Rus- 
sian markets now and for all time, despite the particular 
efforts of the Russian Cooperatives in the United States 
to reorganize permanent commercial intercourse between 
the two countries. The Russian Cooperatives themselves 
are now faced with the necessity of approaching hereto- 
fore boycotted German firms and agents and of taking 
active steps toward resuming such commercial relations 
with Germany as would make it possible to obtain and 
transport into Russia supplies of goods, machinery and 
manufactures of which the Russian population is in such 
dire need. 

Is it not time for America now, before all is lost, 
to change her tactics? Whose interest is she ad- 
vancing Russia's? No. Her own?

A Ransom for Russia's Jews 



J7 OR SOME TIME there have been rumors to the 
effect that the Kolchak agents in this country, hav- 
ing failed to secure satisfactory financial backing for 
the Omsk Government, have begun to work upon 
the racial apprehensions of American Jewry. They 
hoped thus to frighten certain philanthropic Jews 
into financing Kolchak on the theory that by 
helping establish a government " friendly " to the 
Russian Jews they would eliminate the danger of 
further pogroms. The correspondence printed below 
proves that this campaign of misrepresentation is 
actually in progress. The duplicity of Kolchak's 
representatives is revealed by their use of Metro- 
politan Platon to allay the doubts which arose in 
Mr. SchifFs mind that all was not as represented. 
The effrontery of these agents in calling upon Met- 
ropolitan Platon appears when it is remembered that 
instead of the benign individual they represent him 
to be, the Metropolitan's Russian record shows 
that he is a personality of the old regime closely 
identified with the dark forces of the Czar's govern- 
ment, a member of the pogrom faction in the Duma, 
a leader of pogromist Black Hundreds, and an active 
anti-Semite ! 

July 7,. 1919. 
Dear Mr. Sack: 

Reliable reports we got from Siberia state that condi- 
tions, in the territory under the sway of the Omsk Gov- 
ernment, are most unsatisfactory to use a mild expression 
as far as the Jews are concerned. I have myself seen 
photographic reproductions of circular letters issued by a 
committee Avhich signs itself in the name of the Czar and 
the Restoration of Autocracy, inciting the populace into 
atrocities against the Jewish population, against whom, 
it is stated, all kinds of cruelties even murder are 
practiced, without the least interference, if any [thing] 
with the connivance of the authorities. 

As you represent the Omsk Government faction and 
strong propaganda is being made by the Bureau under 
your charge for Admiral Kolchak's cause, I deem it my 
duty to write you in respect to the information that has 
been imparted to me and which is beginning to arouse 
American Jewry. 

Trusting that you can see your way to do something ef- 
fectual in transmitting a word of warning to your friends 
in Siberia, whom you represent, against measures which 
are sure to alienate the sympathy of the American people, 
I am, with kind regards, 

Yours faithfully, 

(Signed) J^ob H. Schiff. 

Evidently the Russian Information Bureau was 
not abashed by this letter, but attempted rather to 
" convert " the American Jewish leader. Here is 
a letter that testifies to the character of this attempt : 

July 11, 1919. 
Dear Mr. Sack: 

Acknowledging receipt of your two letters, in reply to 
my own of the 7th inst, I am extremely appreciative that 
you have gone to the trouble of making so exhaustive an 
answer, which I have read attentively. 



I can well comprehend that the entire situation, which 
you set forth so clearly in your letter, is not only most 
difficult, but also very delicate and that judgment upon 
reports that come from Siberia and Russia' should not be 
hasty. 

We have already discussed here whether it would not 
be well to send to Siberia a reliable independent investi- 
gator, but we have already two men there Dr. Rosenblatt 
at Vladivostok, who represents the Joint Distribution 
Committee, and Mr. Samuel Mason at Yokohama, who 
represents there the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society. Mr. 
Mason has variously been in Siberia; he is absolutely reli- 
able and from both these representatives we have informa- 
tion that the Jewish conditions are not as they should be, 
even under the p'resent critical situation in the districts 
under the sway of the Omsk Government. 

Mr. Louis Marshall, President of the American Jewish 
Committee whom you know and Dr. Cyrus Adler, 
Chairman of its Executive Committee, who have been in 
attendance at the Peace Conference in Paris, have com- 
pleted their very satisfactory work there and are expected 
home in about two weeks. We deem it well to await the 
return of these two gentlemen, in order to confer with 
them and get their wise counsel as concerns the Siberian 
situation and to decide whether, as you have been good 
enough to suggest, it would be best to send another in- 
vestigator. 

We know you are at all times ready to give us your 
valuable support and advice and upon this we shall rely 
to a great extent. 

Thanking you again for the explicitness with which you 
have written me, I am, with kind assurances, 
Faithfully yours, 

(Signed) Jacob H. Schiff. 

Doubtful of the success of his early attempts to 
convert Mr. Schiff, the Director of the Russian 
Information Bureau now used his last tool, the 
Metropolitan Platon, Archbishop of Kherson and 
Odessa, ancient servitor of the Czar. On July 21 
the Director appeared in the character of secret 
agent of the Russian Embassy and chief promoter 
of Platon. 

July 21, 1919. 
Jacob H. Schiff, Esq., 
Kuhn, Loeb & Co., 
Pine and William Streets, 
New York City. 
Dear Mr. Schiff: 

Thank you for your kind letter of the 18th inst. with 
a copy of the letter from the City Editor of the New 
York Call enclosed. I return this letter herewith. 

We have done our best that the statement by Metro- 
politan Platon, correcting what the papers have presented 
as his original statement, should be printed as fully and 
widely as possible. I enclose herewith copies of the 
statement as printed in the New York Times and in the 
New York Herald. In addition to all the New York 
papers, published in English, copies of the statement 
were also sent to the Jewish Daily News, the Jewish 
Morning Journal, the Jewish Daily Forwarts and the 
Jewish Daily Day. 

Mr. Oscar S. Strauss and myself have just visited 
Metropolitan Platon, who was deeply touched by Mr. 
Strauss's visit. We have spent there about an hour and 
a half, and Mr. Strauss told me that he was delighted by 
Metropolitan Platon and the views he expressed during 
the conversation.

THE DIAL 



September 6 



The Joint Distribution Committee was kind enough to 
send me their correspondence with Dr. Rosenblatt, which 
I went through carefully. Significant among these docu- 
ments is Dr. Rosenblatt's cable of May 7th, which as you 
probably recall, reads: 

" No. 4. Imminent danger. Pogroms Ekaterinbourg, 
Omsk, Tomsk, Isabel and other places. Officials openly 
foster anti-Semitic agitation. Claims of Jewish Bolshe- 
vism and profiteering used as a deadly weapon. Frequent 
posters ' Kill Jews.' Situation critical,. Take prompt 
action through Washington." 

As you probably recall, Mr. Frank L. Polk added to 
this cable: 

" I have already warned the Omsk Government to be 
on the lookout for any movement of this kind. Personally 
1 think their fears are unfounded." 

I think that Mr. Polk was right. The danger which 
Dr. Rosenblatt called " imminent," fortunately did not 
result in anything deplorable. As Dr. Rosenblatt himself 
wrote in a letter, dated May 22nd: 

" The new settlers, who compose probably nine-tenths 
of the Jewish population in the Far East and about 
ninety-five per cent in Siberia proper, are afraid of their 
own shadows and talk in whispers. Exaggerated, fan- 
tastic and even absurd stories from town to town ; or- 
dinary robberies are reported as siagled out instances in 
a well-organized plan of action designated for the ex- 
termination of all Jews." 

I fully agree with Dr. Rosenblatt's further notice, in 
the same letter, that " all this is merely symptomatic of 
the real danger in which the Jews are compelled to live." 
I spent on Friday several hours with Mr. J. C. Okou- 
litch, a High Commissioner of the Omsk Government, 
just arrived in this country. Mr. Okoulitch confirmed 
that the reactionary elements in Siberia are active in their 
anti-Semitic propaganda, and stated that if not for the 
Government, terrible Jewish massacres would have hap- 
pened in Siberia months ago. The Government is firm in 
its policy of protecting the Jewish population, and if it 
was incapable until now to stop all the signs of the anti- 
Semitic propaganda, this is because the Government is 
still not stable enough. 

In conclusion I would sum up the situation as follows: 
Four possibilities are open for Siberia and for Russia in 
general: a government temporarily led by Admiral Kol- 
chak; a Bolshevist government; a reactionary govern- 
ment, definitely turning to the restoration of the Czar's 
regime ; and an absence of any government. Out of these 
possibilities, a great part of Russia's democrats prefers 
the Government led by Admiral Kolchak. At the same 
time they greet the organization of support of Admiral 
Kolchak's Government from abroad under guarantees 
that he executed the democratic program which he pro- 
claimed more than once in the most solemn way. 
Very sincerely yours, 

(Signed) A. Sack. 

Thus, without any facts and without facing the 
situation honestly, the Platon-Kolchak representa- 
tive "believed" with Mr. Polk that the fears of 
the American Jewry were " unfounded." The fact 
is that Messrs. Polk, Sack, and Platon do not want 
to know the truth or to let it be known. Their 
game is to frighten the Jewry by playing on their 
racial apprehensions. In the following letter to his 
chief, the Director of the Information Bureau 
reports how he successfully decoyed four Jewish 
leaders into the sanctum of Metropolitan Platon, 
the old Black Hundred pogromist: 



(Translation from the Russian) 

July 29, 1919. 

Michail Michailovich Karpovich, 
Russian Embassy, 
Washington, D. C. 
D'ear Michail Michailovich: 

I want to let you know the details of the visit paid 
yesterday by the Jewish Delegation to Metropolitan Pla- 
ton. These details may prove of interest to Boris Alex- 
androvich [Bakhmietiev, the "Russian Ambassador"] 
and you. 

The delegation was composed of Jacob Schiff, Oscar 
Strauss, Louis Marshall and Rabbi Wise. The Metro- 
politan appeared to have been very much pleased by the 
visit, and received the guests in a very sincere and 
friendly manner. 

The conversation began with a pretty detailed state- 
ment by the Metropolitan on the condition in Russia and 
the necessity, from the point of view of the Russian State 
interests and the interests of the Jewry ? of helping act- 
ively the Government of Admiral Kolchak. 

Afterwards all the members of the delegation spoke 
in turn, beginning with Mr. Schiff. I was present and 
was glad to help the Metropolitan and the gentlemen by 
translating their speeches. All the members of the dele- 
gation first assured the Metropolitan Platon that they 
are strongly opposed to Bolshevism. They stated that 
the great majority of the Jewry in the United States were, 
like the majority of the Jews in Russia, fighting against 
Bolshevism. 

Rabbi Wise said that the policy of tolerance towards 
the Bolshevists was upheld by the Christian advisers of 
President Wilson. As an example, he mentioned the 
resignation of the five members of the American Peace 
Delegation, who protested against the partial recognition 
of Admiral Kolchak. All these people, with Mr. Bullit 
at the head, are Christians. On the other hand, the 
American Jewry is entirely in sympathy with the idea 
of the restoration of a United Democratic Russia and 
are glad to help the Russian people as much as they can. 

Marshall stated that in a few days there would be 
called a meeting of thirty-five or forty of the most impor- 
tant representatives of the American Jewry, and that a 
report of the Jewish delegates at Paris would be pre- 
sented there. A resolution on the Russian question is 
also to be passed. 

This resolution will be sent to Metropolitan Platon as 
an expression of the state of mind of the American Jewry 
concerning Russia. 

The visit closed very satisfactorily and both sides were 
apparently very well satisfied. The statement of the Jew- 
ish Delegation was so sincerely friendly that it remains 
for us to follow hot-foot in order as far as possible to 
create from this state of mind something concrete for 
Russia. 

With sincere regards, 
Shaking your hand, 

(Signed) A. SACK. 

Thus, through a member of the old czarist 
pogrom organization, an attempt is being made to 
take from the Jewish people f America a ransom 
for the lives of their Russian brothers, and by this 
means to reestablish the Black Hundreds in Russia. 
Although no pogroms are taking place under the 
Bolsheviki, the Kolchak people are arousing 
fears among the Jewry by asserting that only 
by the triumph of Kolchak can pogroms be pre- 
vented using czarist men and czarist methods 
to betray American Jewry- and the Russian Revolu- 
tion. 




A FORTNIGHTLY 



The Old Order and the New 



UPON THE CONTINUED " UNWILLINGNESS OR IN- 

ability of the Mexican Government to afford ade- 
quate protection " to American citizens is condi- 
tioned the " radical change " of policy with which 
the United States has threatened Mexico. If any- 
one really requires proof of the willingness of the 
Carranza Government to protect the residents of 
that country, native and foreign, against the dangers 
of internal disorder and foreign intervention 
this proof appears in the fair and frank reply of 
that Government to our ill-tempered challenge. And 
if Carranza's ability to maintain order falls short of 
his good will, whose fault is it? When Washing- 
ton recognized the Carranzist regime, the presump- 
tion was that there would be extended to the new 
Administration such privileges as one friendly gov- 
ernment may extend to another not yet fully es- 
tablished. To the strengthening of Carranza's work 
for law and order, we have contributed, besides 
recognition, enough counter-revolutionary plots to 
empty high official chairs and fill certain well-ap- 
pointed cells if the offenders had ever been pros- 
ecuted under the Espionage Act. Besides this, we 
have refused to allow the free shipment of arms and 
ammunition vitally necessary to the completion of 
Carranza's work in Mexico. The embargo, which 
is popularly supposed to effect only shipments in- 
tended for the use of insurgents, has actually 
operated to keep the Carranza Government from 
snipping to Mexico 11,000,000 cartridges bought 
and paid for three years ago and still stored in the 
city of New York. Obviously, then, the recogni- 
tion of Carranza has taken on the character of in- 
sincerity familiar to the Wilsonian wish. The Ad- 
ministration at Washington has helped, by formal 
recognition and actual repudiation, to create a condi- 
tion of affairs in Mexico which may now be made 
an excuse for intervention. The oil interests need 
not agitate openly for the invasion of Mexico. Let 
them continue to subsidize disorder. Let them hor- 
rify America with murder stories, and sway the 
unstable Administration toward a further with- 
drawal of support from the only power that can stop 
these outrages, and increasing confusion, with inter- 
vention as the logical remedy, becomes inevitable. 

IN THE CONTEST FOR MANDATARIES OVER THE 

Near East there is only one reluctant participant. 
Great Britain and France, Italy and Greece, are in- 
tent on converting their titles to spheres of influ- 
ence, allotted as the spoils of war by secret treaty, 
into mandataries issued for the benefit of civilization 



by the League of Nations. The United States, 
however, has remained aloof from this orgy of con- 
version. Not until the most favorable positions had 
been pre-empted was our government asked to ac- 
cept a mandatary over the remaining areas, Armenia 
and Constantinople. Had we the courage to make 
a drastic conditional .acceptance of this offer the 
futility of secret treaty arrangements might be ex- 
posed and our weak renunciation of Wilsonian prin- 
ciples at the Peace Conference somewhat redeemed. 
At present Asia Minor is divided into spheres of 
influence and interest. In the mandataries these 
spheres are in general confirmed, with certain 
changes and extensions, and the principle of eco- 
nomic rivalry and political cross purposes is per- 
petuated. What could be done under the manda- 
tary system to avert the exacerbating conflicts and 
struggles and irritations which must necessarily 
ensue ? Only one plan suggests itself : to place Asia 
Minor under the mandate of a single, disinterested 
state, with the financial burden of administration 
borne pro rata by the various members of the 
League. Such a scheme would wipe out separate 
spheres of national influence in favor of one large 
united sphere of human influence upon which the 
scientific, educational, and technical resources of 
Western Civilization might be steadily focussed. 
Whatever the underlying population might think, 
this would be a politically sane method of exploit- 
ing undeveloped resources, overcoming minority dis- 
criminations in the welter of tribes and national- 
ities, and doing away with a battlefield of 
contentious imperialisms. While Great Britain 
dominates Persia and Mesopotamia, and the French 
Syria, and Italy and Greece lesser regions, the as- 
sumption of a partitive mandatary by the United 
States would merely add another element to that 
gross mixture of competitions, rivalries, jealousies, 
and discriminations out of which a new war will 
surely be released with explosive violence. By x de- 
manding complete control over Asia Minor, in 
trusteeship for the world at large, the United States 
would offer a practicable alternative to the present 
imbecile policy of partition. Such a demand would 
challenge the financial and military imperialism of 
the Great Powers. It would present a clear-cut 
issue by means of which the validity of the League 
of Nations' colonial system would either be dis- 
proved or vindicated. Our government should 
either make such a demand or withdraw from the 
scene altogether. Otherwise our presence in Asia 
Minor will mean nothing more than it did in Russia 
and at Versailles: it will mean that we are willing

to stabilize the status quo of imperialism as we have 
fixed the status quo of capitalism, and are ready to 
bear the burden of this program without sharing the 
benefit. It would be another evidence that we are 
incapable of realizing our American political ideals, 
and that the result of our sublime efforts is simply 
to idealize European Realpolitik. 



FROM THE EVIDENCE IN HAND IT SEEMS AT 

least probable that the Allied ultimatum to Hun- 
gary was the result rather than the cause of the 
impotence of the late Hapsburg Government. With 
no other source of information than the fragment- 
ary published reports, it did not take the people of 
this country two weeks (August 9-23) to discover 
that the Archduke's government " came into ex- 
istence not by the will of the people but by a coup 
d'etat carried out by a small body of police under 
the protection of a foreign army. " These facts, 
now self-righteously published abroad in the Allied 
ultimatum, were known to the emissaries of the 
Entente when, on the day of the coup d'etat, they 
held a conference with the Archduke and delegated 
governmental authority to him. They were known 
at Paris when the policy of bluster against Rou- 
mania was abandoned, and the army which fathered 
the dictatorship was authorized to remain in Buda- 
pest for the purpose of assisting disinterestedly in 
the establishment of a government sufficiently 
stable to sign and execute the Allied peace terms. 
Certainly, then, it was not any sudden revelation of 
the Archduke's character and intentions that caused 
the Allies to break definitely and finally with him. 
Rather it may be supposed that considerations such 
as these led to the new judgment of Paris: by foster- 
ing a monarchist movement in Hungary, the Allies, 
and France in particular, would put a considerable 
strain upon their relations with the small states of 
the cordon sanitaire Poland, Czechoslovakia, and 
Ukrainia where Allied influence seems already to 
be losing something of its potence; further, it ap- 
peared likely that a monarchy in Hungary, propped 
up by interventionist troops, would collapse under 
the burden of executing the Allied terms when the 
Roumanians were finally withdrawn; and finally 
the mocking inconsistency of installing a Hapsburg 
king to enforce an Allied peace promised to alienate 
from the Supreme Council the hardly reducible 
minimum of public support still retained by that 
body. In view of these conditions, with the advice 
of Mr. Hoover, the Council repudiated a dictator- 
ship which had at first been complacently accepted by 
the Entente mission. Does this mean then that the 
Supreme Council has at last adopted a policy of non- 
intervention in Hungary? When the Entente troops 
are withdrawn, and food is offered without distinc- 
tion to all the parties in Hungary, it will be time 
enough to rejoice over an Allied change of heart. 
The value of lesser alterations of policy is rather 
emotional than practical. 



L AINSTAKINGLY PRICKED OUT UPON A MAP, TH 1 

military frontier of Soviet Russia assumes the form 
of a great triangle, with its apex at Onega on the 
Arctic shore, the eastern extremity of its base-line 
near the point where the Trans-Siberian Railway 
crosses the Tobol River in Siberia, and the opposite 
base-angle near Kiev in the Ukraine. On the north- 
eastern side of this triangle, counter-revolutionary 
operations were begun in the spring with the ob- 
ject of affecting a juncture of British-North-Rus- 
sian and Kolchak forces at Kotlas, half way be- 
tween Archangel and Glazov. But as the British 
never covered more than a minute fraction of the 700 
miles to Glazov, and as Admiral Kolchak has now 
been driven back to a line some 600 miles east of 
that point, the northeastern frontier is, from the 
military point of view, non-existent. On the other 
two sides of the triangle three major operations arc 
in progress. Of least importance is the Petrograd 
offensive, which has been launched repeatedly and 
has failed as often, by reason of a multiplicity of 
internal dissensions in the Baltic states, and also 
because of a widespread fear of Kolchak's imperial- 
istic policy toward peoples formerly within the Em- 
pire. The movement now converging upon the 
southwest angle of the triangle is of much greater 
significance. Here the Poles and the Ukrainians 
lately at war with each other and the forces 
of General Denikin are cooperating in a move- 
ment which has cut off the Soviet Republic 
from the Black Sea and has won back most of the 
Ukraine from the Red Armies. The third major 
operation is that of the Soviet forces engaged in 
driving the eastern point of the Great Russian tri- 
angle more deeply into Siberia. In balancing these 
last two movements against each other, two things 
must be taken into consideration: the extent of the 
territary involved, and the character of this territory. 
Unquestionably Denikin, with the Poles and the 
Ukrainians, has overrun a region more extensive 
than that from which Kolchak has been expelled 
by the Soviet forces. On the other hand, the ex- 
pulsion of the Soviet troops from Ukrainia amounts 
to the recapture of territory which they have held 
intermittently as foreign armies of occupation since 
the Ukrainian declaration of independence in Jan- 
uary 1918. The reconstitution of the Ukranian 
state will necessitate either the abandonment by 
Denikin of a large area now controlled by him, or 
a dispute between him and the Ukrainians which 
would probably result in war. Another extensive 
region controlled by Denikin is that populated by 
the Don Cossacks, followers of Korniloff in the 
revolt against Kerensky, never completely subject 
to the Soviet rule. But within the area just won 
by the central Russian forces there are no racial or 
nationalistic boundaries to- create dissension. By and 
large, it appears that through the fortunes of war 
a region torn by rival ambitions has been exchanged 
for a region capable of being absorbed completely 
and finally into the life of the Soviet Republic. 



THE DIAL

\VHAT WOULD ALPHONSE DAUDET HAVE SAID 
to the methods of the French military command in 
the Rhineland? Shortly after the expropriation of 
Alsace-Lorraine he wrote a pathetic sketch por- 
traying the noble sorrow of a schoolmaster forced 
by the ruthless Prussian administrators to give his 
last lesson in French. A tender and heart-wringing 
story it was; a reminder to that next generation of 
Alsatians "who could not forget." It is time to 
translate this masterpiece into German, and to 
couple it with the reminder that stupidity and 
cruelty are the marks of a military caste no matter 
what its country of origin may be. " The teaching 
of the French language will be obligatory in the 
elementary schools beginning with the next opening 
of classes." That is the text of the French com- 
mand to the local authorities in the sector south of 
Coblenz. This is the obvious .opening of an at- 
tempt to denationalize the Rhineland, and it follows 
significantly on the heels of the ill-timed effort to 
set up a subsidiary state. The Quai d'Orsay does 
not wish to court a second failure in establishing its 
protectorate, and it has therefore set about to pre- 
pare the ground prudently by making the Rhineland 
French in spirit before it makes it French in polit- 
ical fact. The only immediate obstacle in the way 
of this program is the Rhineland Commission. But 
the French influence in that commission is pre- 
ponderant, and should it develop an opposition 
to the reactionary, militarist program, it is 
doubtful whether it could enforce it any better 
than the Allied Supreme Council in the face of the 
Roumanian occupation of Hungary. As for the 
plebiscite in the Saar Valley at the end of fifteen 
years, the present conduct of the French military 
command furnishes a basis for our worst suspicions. 
The policy of deferred seizure is doubtless a refine- 
ment upon the abrupt methods practiced by the 
Prussians; but it is only a refinement. As long as 
the reactionary elements continue to exercise power 
the end will remain the same. 



AT LAST THE RED TERROR HAS COME TO AMERI- 
ca. It is running wild among the guardians of 
Business as Usual; official, semi-official, and quasi- 
official; courts, camps, and churches; legislative, 
judiciary, and executive. It is true, the common 
run of American humanity continue to be singularly 
immune and apathetic, but the Terror is already 
consuming the tissues of many substantial citizens 
in a shockingly public manner. The Guardians of 
the Vested Interests are panic-stricken, all and sev- 
eral, certified and subsidiary and surreptitious. The 
commercialized newspapers all see Red. So do the 
official and quasi-official conspiracies, such as the 
Lusk Commission, the Union League Club, the 
Security League, and the Civic Federation, as well 
as the Publicity Police, the Workday Politicians, 
the Clerics of the Philistine Confession, and the 
Wild Asses of the Devil generally. 



Driven by their own Red fancy, these many 
Guardians have been banding together to molest 
such of their neighbors as do not see Red ; and with 
the aid or connivance of panic-stricken officials, the 
conspirators have been going in for inquisitorial 
raids, to find evidence of undue sanity- among the 
sober population. All persons who refuse to be 
stampeded by the Red alarm are open to suspicion 
unless they are visibly identified with the Vested 
Interests and any person who falls under the sus- 
picion of the official and quasi-official alarmists is, 
in effect, assumed to be guilty of sedition. Acute 
paranoia persecutoria is coming to be rated the chief 
of the civic virtues. 

Already the confederated paranoiacs have assem- 
bled much curious evidence of undue sanity among 
the vulgar. An extract from an exhibit of such 
evidence a letter presumed to show seditiously ex- 
cessive sanity is here reproduced : 

. . . the thing that seems to excite the Chester authori- 
ties mainly is that the second speaker at the meeting 
. advocated the pardon of all political prisoners, including 
Eugene Debs. The District Attorney said that Mr. Debs 
was a " stinking, flea-bitten, rotten skunk." ... I asked 
him what the possible charge [against the defendants] 
could be and he said that they would try to hold them 
[64 men] for treason against the state. They seem to have 
a law in Philadelphia establishing a state treason against 
the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He looked up the law 
in my presence and read it and then agreed with me that 
the law would not apply. Then he said that the next thing 
they could hold them for would be the section of inciting 
to riot. But it developed that that constituted only mis- 
demeanor and that the utmost could be a fine not exceed- 
ing $100. I asked him whether he thought $5,000 was the 

right sort of bail. He said that the g d Poles and 

Russians had money to burn. . . . Before I left Ches- 
ter he told me that he thought that . . . any Jaw- 
yer who would act for these men would be a disgrace 
in the community. ... I told him that the informa- 
tion [in regard to the legal fee] had been sent in by a 
Quaker and then I struck the wrong key. He then called 
the Quakers all kinds of names, the main adjective being 
" stinking." 

Another letter reporting the hearings of this case 
says: 

The attorney from Philadelphia who acted as local 
counsel challenged the Judge to point to one decision In 
the courts of Pennsylvania under which the defendants 
could be held, whereupon the Judge sarcastically re- 
marked, " I am much afraid that your industry has not 
been rewarded. If you will only look into a case decided 
in the year 1787, about the time when the Constitution was 
to be adopted, you will find a precedent under which I 
can hold these defendants." This case, it developed, was 
the famous liberty pole case. The Judge said that at the 
time of the adoption of the Constitution " there _were 
some misguided individuals who under the leadership of 
Thomas Jefferson protested against the Constitution be- 
cause it gave the federal government too much power." 
But the Judge mentioned that the fact that the Consti- 
tution was afterwards adopted showed that these indi- 
viduals were wrong and mistaken. During the protest 
raised by "these so-called "misled individuals" they 
erected what was known then as liberty poles . . . 
A man was arrested for being present at the erection 
of such a liberty pole, although he did not take part 
in it, and he was convicted by the local court in 
Philadelphia 1 ; the Judge finished, "and thaPis the law

in this state and it is a good law and I am going to hold 
these defendants for unlawful assembly under five thou- 
sand dollars bail for action of grand jury." 

It is alleged by the terrorized Guardians that the 
letters which are here quoted go to show that certain 
persons have interested themselves in procuring 
counsel for certain impecunious workmen of foreign 
extraction who were to have been convicted out of 
hand on a footless charge of rioting; all of which 
is taken as presumptive evidence of a seditious de- 
gree of sobriety. These particular exhibits may 
perhaps lay bare the Red state of mind of the Guard- 
ians in a more picturesque fashion than the common 
run of these uncanny keepsakes of the demented 
which they have been assembling in the course of 
these raids; but incredibly foolish as this particular 
episode is, it is after all no more than a fair indica- 
tion of the pitch to which official hysteria has already 
risen. The volume of evidence of this character 
assembled by the Red alarmists is already fantas- 
tically large ; and they are busily accumulating more 
of the same kind, by fair means and foul. 

1 N VIEW OF THE UNEXAMPLED INQUISITORIAL 

raids set afoot or connived at by panic-stricken of- 
ficials, and in view of the consequent increasing in- 
security of person and property, it should be worth 
while to take stock of the situation and cast up an 
account of these disquieting circumstances that are 
driving the Guardians of the Vested Interests to 
distraction and frightening the Administration into 
a muddle of unreasoned violence and subterfuge. 
Notoriously, an uneasy situation has arisen out of 
the war, and more immediately out of the highly 
remarkable Peace in which the war has been brought 
to a provisional close. There is much at stake in 
the way of vested rights, and the state of things is 
precarious enough. These disquieting circumstances 
which go to make up this uneasy situation all con- 
verge to the general upshot that Bolshevism is a 
menace to the Vested Interests of privilege and 
property. The dread reality of this menace to the 
Vested Interests is not to be denied or made light of. 
The Vested Interests are doubtless riding for a fall. 
But there is also nothing to be gained by over-state- 
ment and extravagant alarm. Hysteria is neither 
comfortable nor convincing. 

The guardians of the Vested Interests in Amer- 
ica are doubtless wise in taking all reasonable pre- 
cautions; they are presumably right in their evident 
belief that the continued rule of these Vested Inter- 
ests is no longer so secure as they would like ; but 
the Guardians would doubtless be still wiser to con- 
fine their efforts to reasonable precautions instead of 
screaming Wolf! Wolf! when there is no wolf in 
sight. But it is not easy to keep an even temper 
when the blessed beatitudes of special privilege are 
in a way to be compromised. The Guardians of 
these blessed beatitudes have been swept off their 
footing by the discovery that a division is beginning 
to run between the Vested Interests and the under- 



lying population, and that the Vested Interests are 
presumably the weaker of the two parties. NQ one 
is to blame for this rapidly maturing division of the 
community into the kept classes on the one *ide and 
the underlying population from whom their keep 
is drawn on the other side. Nor should it surprise 
or alarm anyone who is at all informed, or willing 
to be informed, as to the run of facts in the world 
of business and industry the past few years. It is 
all an outcome of the dispassionate sweep of forces 
which no man can withstand or deflect. Only the 
Guardians of the kept classes have been unable to 
see the matter in that light, because it is the whole 
duty of these Guardians of the Old Order to en- 
deavor by all means, fair or foul, to deflect the sweep 
of events over which they have no control. Such a 
change of base as is now coming in sight is in the 
nature of a moral impossibility for the keepers of 
the Old Order. 

Meantime the experience of the war and after 
has brought the Guardians to realize that the con- 
tinued rule of these Vested Interests of privilege 
and property runs at cross-purposes with the mate- 
rial welfare of the underlying population, and to 
realize also that the underlying population is be- 
ginning to be aware of the same fact. But the 
Guardians fail to realize that a very stubborn and 
massive fabric of settled use and wont surrounds 
and supports these vested rights of privilege and 
property, and that the American population is very 
stolid and submissive in everything that concerns its 
inbred prejudices. It is known and is beginning to 
be notorious that the Vested Interests of business 
are driven by business considerations to waste, mis- 
manage, and obstruct the country's productive in- 
dustry, unavoidably and unremittingly, and to divert 
an ever-increasing share of the country's income to 
their own profit; and the Guardians are no longer 
able to avoid all knowledge of this notorious state 
of things; and they have let these known facts drive 
them to the hasty conclusion that so soon as the 
population at large come to know the same facts 
and to take stock of them, there must immediately 
follow a headlong popular revolt and a sweeping 
disallowance of all these obstructive vested rights 
of privilege and property. The Guardians of the 
Vested Interests are presumably right in believing 
that the existing state of things in business and in- 
dustry should logically lead to revolt and disposses- 
sion so soon as the facts of the case are known ; but 
they overlook the main consideration, that any ef- 
fectual movement of overturn will have to proceed 
not on grounds of logic, but on grounds of senti- 
ment and the strategic disposal of forces. Hence 
their excessive alarm. Popular sentiment, as well 
as the strategic disposal of forces, is still securely to 
be counted on to uphold the established order of 
vested rights and Business as Usual. The Guard- 
ians have allowed the known facts of the case to un- 
seat their common serise. Hence the pitiful spectacle 
of official hysteria and the bedlamite conspiracies in 
restraint of sobriety.

Casual Comment 

THE NEW MOVEMENT IN THE THEATER USED 
to be the talk of the studios and the literary mag- . 
azines. In fact it originated and grew and reached 
its heyday and died in the studios and literary mag- 
azines. The theater scarcely knew it. The profes- 
sional dramatist and the professional actor laughed 
at it; the professional manager vituperated it; the 
playgoer ignored it. Literally the New Movement 
never got anywhere. Certainly it never got beyond 
scenery. Naturally one is tempted to ask why this 
healthy impulse to thrust aside the quackeries and 
insincerities of current theatricals proved so frus- 
trate. Until lately the answer to this question took 
refuge in a cynicism which affected to believe that 
good things are sterile and shortlived and ineffec- 
tual in direct proportion to their value to the 
human race. But it is now possible to expose the 
fallacy of this banal assumption. What was lacking 
in the New Theater Movement was a willingness 
to deal with the economic structure of the dram- 
atic arts. It assumed that the economic stage was set 
and that the respective parts' in theatrical production 
had been assigned for all time. The members of 
the Actors' Equity Association have lately pro- 
claimed the falsity of this assumption. In adjusting 
what was relatively a petty question with the czars 
of upper Broadway tbey found themselves in a 
position that compelled them to utilize the whole 
technique of industrial group action. They formed 
an association. TJiey formulated their collective 
demands and sought as a corporate body to bargain 
for their acceptance. Appearing in one of the most 
personalized and individualized professions, these 
actions implied a revolution in the actor's scheme of 
life, but the bearing of economic principles upon 
the New Movement in the Theater would not have 
been evident had the actors succeeded forthwith in 
making the businesslike adjustments upon which 
they properly have insisted. In the course of a few 
years the actors telescoped a century of trades-union 
history, and at last when they decided to rent a 
ball and run a benefit performance for themselves 
and by themselves they reached a plane of industrial 
practice upon which only a few venturous personnel 
managers, economists, and guild socialists now 
stand. They discovered that they acted with 
greater creative vigor in the pursuit (as Mr. Ber- 
trand Russell would say) of a universal end 
without any especial monetary reward than they 
acted in the old days when they jockeyed for a posi- 
tion on Broadway and measured their success by 
Broadway's fatal standard. Out of the mouth of 
fools comes wisdom, and out of the experience of the 
star comedian of the Follies camfe this perception. 
It was a thrilling and astounding discovery no 
doubt the discovery that the money incentive had 
never released the creative impulses and that the 
attitude of being in business for one's health (at 
which the mammonists sneer) is the only 'healthy 



approach to one's business. Let us hope that the 
members of the Actors' Equity Association will be 
shrewd enough to follow the implications of their 
discovery; for the hope of the dramatic arts rests 
upon their ability to eliminate those Tired Business 
Men of Broadway, the managers, who have erected 
their own flaccid tastes and moral prejudices into 
a criterion of public entertainment. Let the actors 
band together with the dramatists, the scene paint- 
ers, the stage hands, the electricians, the ushers, and 
the other subsidiary crafts. Let them pledge their 
joint talents and aptitudes as guarantee of their 
capacity to attract audiences and thus justify the 
extension of credit for new productions on the 
part of bankers and business men. Let them take 
a new pride in their guild, found their own schools 
of acting, and give full play to all the creative 
forces that pulse through the organization from 
stagehand to star. The significant fight is not this 
passing one against the managers' syndicate, with its 
inevitable ending to the victor belongs the spoil. In 
the contest for money advantages the syndicate can, 
by reason of interest and long training, more 
than hold its own. The real engagement will 
begin when the actors set out to become their 
own producers, and when they seek to realize the 
principle that to those who have the ability to 
produce belong the instruments of production. In 
this battle they will learn that victory brings with 
it not booty but toil and that the toil is superior 
to the booty! With the lesson thus acquired the 
New Theater Movement, rich in dramatic poten- 
tialities, may resume its career with some prospect 
of substantial success. 



1 HE DEBATE CONCERNING THE RELATION OF 

Christianity and war does not date its beginning 
from the outbreak of the European conflict, nor 
have the last five years contributed much of value 
to the discussion. True there have been of late 
numerous efforts to extricate the Church from the 
devilish dilemma in which it was placed by the 
great war, but most of these efforts have been 
neither more nor less successful than that of the 
Rev. Dr. John Kilman in The War and Preaching 
(Yale University Press) ; that is to say, they have 
not been successful at all. If, as is so often said, 
the Galilean Gospel is of so great simplicity that 
its major truths are within the compass of a child's 
understanding, expert pulling and hauling to stretch 
a cover of Christian decency over the war seems 
sadly out of place. The incongruity of this type 
of apologetics appears plainly enough when Kilman 
and Tolstoy are set against each other. In The 
Pathway of Life (International Book Publishing 
Company) Tolstoy asks: 

Shall we understand the words of Christ admonishing us 
to love those that hate us, our enemies, and forbidding 
force of any description, just as they were spoken and 
expressed, or as the teaching of meekness, humility, and 
love, or as something still different?

THE DIAL

And this is the Russian sage's answer: 

Without admitting that under no circumstances may man 

use force on others, all the teachings of Christ are empty 

words. 

For the soothing of Christian consciences that can- 
not accept this interpretation the sacrificial aspect 
of death by battle has of late been much empha- 
sized. But the whole business of the soldier is to 
use force to destroy the enemy ; that he himself is 
perhaps destroyed by opposing force is an unfortu- 
nate accident which prohibits his accomplishing the 
purpose for which he was sent into battle, but has 
no bearing whatever upon the moral value of that 
purpose. A soldier does not die for a cause; he 
kills for it. 

With the world at war, then, the " Christian " 
can break with the State and go to jail; or he can 
break wkh Christianity and go to war; or he can 
take the easy and popular course and with any 
amount of professional assistance make Christian- 
ity over and take it to war with him. People who 
feel that nothing can be right except it bear the 
name of Christian found themselves forced to the 
latter course if they were to support the war at all. 
But in the confession that " the right " and " the 
Christian " need not always be synonymous there 
lies the alternative possibility of forceful action that 
is at the same time honest action of frankly un- 
christian war that is nevertheless deemed necessary 
and right under the conditions given. By and large, 
would it not be better to confess that Christian doc- 
trine is not universally and eternally applicable 
that it may at times be advisable to commit 
unchristian acts and that it is better to call such 
acts unchristian than to warp Christianity to cover 
them, thereby depriving humanity of the inspiration 
of an idealistic system capable of full application 
only in better times than these? 

T 

- 1 - HEY SAY THAT FREE VERSE IS AT ITS FREEST IN 

England today ; that the old forms are being 
attacked and that the younger generation is finding 
a hearing even in the conservative reviews. Little 
confirmation has been given these rumors, however, 
by the six volumes of verse most lately imported. 

Two volumes in the group (Small Craft, and 
Sailor Town; Doran) promise something more, and 
indeed contain passages of no little strength. C. 
Fox Smith is the author, a young lady who has been 
hailed as a writer of genuine sailor chanteys, a sec- 
ond Masefield. It is quite possible that her pub- 
lishers are correct, and that she has acquired the 
real sea swing. She does not, however, know 
sailors; the British lads that man her craft are 
quite as fabulous as the roast beef of old England. 

Another woman who comes to us highly recom- 
mended is May Doney, whose Way of Wonder 
(Doran) carries an introduction by Sir Arthur 
Quiller-Couch. She is a not-too-complex soul who 
thinks the universe is simply wonderful and 
expresses her adoration of the deity by a profusion 



of capital letters. Dorothy L. Sayers writes re- 
ligious verse much better than Miss Doney. The 
God of Catholic Tales (Oxford) is medieval and 
warmly personal, the antithesis of Miss Doney 's 
conception. In these days no one gives him much 
credence. Nevertheless he reads well, and the verse 
of Catholic Tales, whether good or bad, always 
achieves more freshness than one expects. 

The one bit of vers libre to be found in these six 
books managed to creep between the covers of 
Father Noah (McBride). Geoffrey Whitworth 
who usually concerns himself with writing ballads 
of polite suicide and painted ladies found for his 
title poem the amusing and fantastic idea that Noah, 
by pulling out the bung of the Ark, could have put 
an end to the human race. This concept he de- 
velops in homely language, w r hile achieving an 
unobstructive Biblical meter. Altogether he has been 
quite successful. 

Thomas Thornely is a Cambridge don with a 
small estate, some knowledge of the classics, and a 
distaste for modern innovations. Late in middle 
life, his facility for rhyming has led him to publish 
his collected verse (Verses from Fen and Fell; 
Cambridge University Press). He laments the old 
days whimsically, and is enough affected by the w,ar 
to join the hue and cry after the Kaiser. The 
Bolsheviki arrived too late to go to press, but one 
hopes for a later volume.

THE LEAGUE OF SECRET POLICE 

SIR : .A rather easy optimism has been expecting 
that, with the end of the war, would come, too, the 
end of the period of repression of freedom in the 
warring soi-disant democracies. Similar expecta- 
tions, I have not the least doubt, were held a hun- 
dred years ago when Louis XIV was safely restored 
to the throne of his fathers and Napoleonic militar- 
ism " crushed." 

But Waterloo was followed, not by the lifting, 
but by the tightening of the grip of governments. 
It was after the peace was made that there began 
the period of the Six Acts in England, the White 
Terror in France, the Carlsbad Decrees in Ger- 
many, of the Holy Alliance all over Europe. 

And today all the phenomena visible here in 
England point to a similar attempt to rivet perma- 
nently the shackles imposed on us " for the dura- 
tion of the war." The same temptations are pres- 
ent. There are ideals abroad threatening to the 
powers that be. There is " Bolshevism " today as 
there were Liberalism and Nationalism a century 
ago. And there is now, as then, the same too- 
natural loathing of men to part with the arbitrary 
power they have once wielded. They are not show- 
ing the slightest intention of parting with it. Our 
mistress D. O. R. A. is to hold sway for " at least 
another year " albeit she was supposed to die at 
" the end of the war or as soon afterwards as possi- 
ble." And she is to be supplemented during the 
last year of her reign by her sister and destined suc- 
cessor, T. O. P. A. the Treaty of Peace Act 
under which " His Majesty may do such things as 
appear to him necessary for carrying out the Treaty" 
a magnificent clause which evidently gives George 
V, or in reality, of course, Mr. Lloyd George, legal 
power to do anything he may please. 

We then, in England, are clearly in for a pleas- 
ant time. But what I particularly want you in 
America to realize is that this is not a national but 
an international problem: that, while each govern- 
ment, British, French, German and, I presume, 
American, will deal with its own Radicals, they will 
do so, not in isolation, but in collaboration. We 
are in fact up against an inter-governmental organi- 
zation for the suppression of freedom; and its 
methods are based upon those of the old Russian 
Secret Service, whose methods the French police had 
many opportunities of studying during the years 
of their cooperation in the days of the Czarist 
alliance. Three or four cases during the past month 
have given us good warning that this is so, and have 
given us some insight into the methods adopted. 

The first is that of Robert Minor, which you 
presumably know as well as I, for all that I saw the 
whole affair as it developed in Paris. But let me 
remind you of the essential facts: that Minor was 
accused by the British Government of carrying on 
" Bolshevik propaganda " ; that he was secretly 



arrested, without warrant or charge, by the French 
police, and handed over to the American military 
authorities, who placed him in solitary confinement 
at Coblenz, told him that he would probably be 
shot, and were preparing to try him by court-mar- 
tial. After a month's imprisonment, the case was 
abandoned, it was " considered inadvisable to press 
the charges at present " and Minor was set free. 
But that was only because the authorities discov- 
ered, to their intense chagrin, that they had stirred 
up a hornet's nest, and that half the press of Eng- 
land was a-buzz with the matter they had hoped to 
carry through in comfortable secrecy. 

" It is these confounded newspapermen," said a 
high American officer just before they let Minor go, 
" and it looks as though we shall lose our man after 
all." 

Very closely parallel to the Minor case but this 
time involving Great Britain and Germany instead 
of Great Britain, America, and France is the case 
of Philips Price, the Berlin correspondent of the 
London Daily Herald. Price was arrested in Ber- 
lin, again without warrant and without charge, by 
the German military. In reply to the protests of his 
fellow-correspondents, Herr Noske, the Minister of 
Defense and nead of the reactionary party in the 
Weimar Cabinet, stated that though Price was be- 
ing kept in prison, the German government had no 
particular interest in him, but that he was liable to 
be handed over to the British at Cologne. And the 
only allegations made against him in his examina- 
tion in prison were that he had conducted anti-En- 
tente propaganda while in Russia and that he was 
about to go to the Ruhr Valley, which is close to the 
British zone of occupation. 

Again there was an uncomfortable amount of 
publicity. Again when the case got well ventilated 
and the protests began, Price was released by the 
intervention of the German civil authorities. And 
of course there were prompt and quite unconvinc- 
ing denials that the British were in any way con- 
cerned or that there had been any intention of 
handing him over to them at Cologne. 

Just at the same time as Price was seized, Emont, 
rhe leader of the German Bank-Clerks' Union, was 
also arrested on the charge of having been concerned 
in the usual " Bolshevik propaganda " among the 
British troops on the Rhine. He contrived to es- 
cape from prison, after being told that he was to 
be deported to Cologne for trial by the British mili- 
tary authorities. Again the unexpected and unwel- 
come publicity was followed by the usual denials. 

So much for the three main cases three cases in 
which -prominent men have been secretly arrested 
without warrant or charge by international coopera- 
tion between the secret services. But these do not 
exhaust the evidence. 

There is the case of Longuet and Frossard. They 
were detained at Folkestone by the British police, 
prevented from attending a British Labor Party 
Conference, and sent back to France. Simultan- 
eously Jouhaux and Dumoulin of the French C. G.

T. and d'Arragona of the Italian C. G. L., who 
had already landed, were subjected to a ridiculous 
cross-examination which -aimed at showing that they 
had come to England as bearers of German gold for 
the suborning of British merchant-seamen. It was 
a silly story; but the point is that it was based on 
information sent by the Paris branch of the British 
Secret Service, prompted by the French military, 
who, after the manner of their predecessors in the 
Dreyfus days, are willing to believe anything and to 
do anything against a political opponent; and that 
Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Shortt complac- 
ently set the British police machine to work against 
two distinguished guests at the behest of the French 
royalist-militarist clique. 

Then, there is the case of Mr. Nathan, the Brit- 
ish secret service agent, who seems to be curiously 
involved in the doings of your famous Lusk-Steven- 
son Committee. You probably know far more 
about Mr. Nathan than I do. But the essen- 
tial thing is that Mr. Nathan is an international 
figure, that he is another piece of evidence of the 
international work that is going on. And here, 
quite by chance, is yet another at my hand a short 
news paragraph telling of the arrest, on arrival at 
Naples of several Italian " anarchists " on informa- 
tion supplied by the American police. America and 
Italy this time you see. It has many ramifications, 
this network of reactionary intrigue. There is, I 
have no doubt, much more evidence to come. But 
it is fairly clear, is it not, what we are up against? 
The League of Nations may be a still-born child; 
but the League of Secret Police is an unpleasantly 
rigorous brat. And if it is allowed to grow to full 
maturity, it will be just about as dangerous a mon- 
ster as ever vexed the patient earth. 

We have got to cooperate in infanticide, then, 
we on this side and you on that. And the best 
monster-brat-killer, or at any rate scotcher, at our 
service at the moment is certainly publicity. It 
was publicity that saved Minor and Price; publicity 
that forced Mr. Lloyd George to apologize to Lon- 
guet. Publicity, I hope, will curb Mr. Nathan's 
activities. 

It will not do the trick entirely. That will only 
be accomplished when you and we and the French 
and the Germans and the rest of us have, each in 
our own country, dealt faithfully with our present 
military masters. But plenty of publicity will be a 
great check on these new activities. Because there 
is still a certain prejudice in this country against 
cooperation with Noske and his friends; and there 
is, I should imagine, a prejudice in the United States 
against American citizens' being arrested at the be- 
hest of Scotland Yard or the British War Office. 

The Police International is painfully anxious to 
hide its activities as far as possible from the eye 
of the public. Clearly it is our job to give it that 
fame which it deserves but does not desire.

HERESY AND INFALLIBILITY 

SIR: The following, note from the Adjutant- 
General's office at Washington (July 7) may have 
more than a personal interest: 

I am directed by the Secretary of War to acknowledge 
the receipt of your letter dated June 13, 1919, con- 
cerning Carl Haessler. This case has been brought to 
the attention of the War Department many times and 
both the details of Haessler's court-martial and the con- 
dition of his family are thoroughly understood in the De- 
partment. The Department has attempted to deal fairly 
with all men who are sincere in their conscientious ob- 
jections to warfare. Haessler, however, has been 
judged as not being one of this type, his objections being 
against this war rather than all wars, due to the fact 
that he considers it a capitalistic one. On that account 
it seems impossible to grant him further clemency at the 
present time. 

Thus Carl Haessler, former Rhodes Scholar 
and instructor in Philosophy at Illinois, lately re- 
moved from Leavenworth to Alcatraz, is paying as 
heavy a penalty for the long result of his political 
and social thinking, and for the courage in times 
of stress to regulate his conduct according to that 
thinking, as the forger and the embezzler, the thief 
and the thug and the white-slaver pay for their 
vice and crime. 

Query: if an American citizen gets several years 
behind the bars for believing this a capitalistic war, 
what is to be the federal penalty for those other 
American citizens who, having learned their politi- 
cal philosophy from President Wilson, believe this 
is a capitalistic peace?

Notes on New Books 

SAINT'S PROGRESS. By John Galsworthy. 404 
pages. Scribner. 

In Saint's Progress Galsworthy has contented 
himself with type-characters. The book lacks in 
this respect the searching surety of The Freelands 
and falls far short of The Man of Property. The 
author's defense lies in his having intended, rather, 
a study of the play of the forces of love and religion, 
against the background of the war. In this method 
it recalls The Dark Flower. In Saint's Progress 
we have mirrored' for our discernment a number of 
indistinct but moving figures of mid-war days. 
That of Edward Pierson, in Holy Orders twenty- 
six years and not now knowing what he believes, is 
Central. Gently dogmatic, widowed after eight per- 
fect years of marriage, he lives a life in which emo- 
tionalism, thwarted and wistful, mingles indistin- 
guishably with religious fervor. He clings in lonely 
fashion to his church. His two daughters are slip- 
ping, have slipped insensibly, from the leash of his 
faith. 

Gratiou, the elder, is a nurse at tw r enty and wed- 
ded to a soldier-doctor of materialist views. She 
has decided, in the face of the world war, that either 
there is no God, or, worse still, he is either a wicked 
or a helpless God. She is resolved to look beyond 
such a God for truth. " Some people search all 
their lives, and die searching. Why shouldn't I?" 
The younger daughter, who usurps the center of the 
reader's interest, is Noel, eighteen. Here as else- 
where in his work, Galsworthy does supremely well 
what few of our moderns can do at all. He por- 
trays the young girl at her loveliest, a creature of 
intelligence, simplicity, and charm. Noel Pierson 
enlists powerfully the reader's sympathy and under- 
standing. In her own passionate revolt against 
convention and the cruelty of death, in the terrific 
tangle caused by her war baby, she arrays us on the 
side of Youth, Youth in the forcing-house of war 
pitifully snatching what it can of sweetness before 
life is crushed out. 

" I shall have a son ; Cyril won't quite have died. 
And I don't want to be forgiven," she says to those 
who refuse to permit her marriage to the dead boy 
whom she had known only twenty-one days. But 
her effort to make the best of it, to rejoice in her 
baby, is thwarted by the Godly Christians of her 
father's parish. 

' They don't even begin to believe,' says Noel, 
' whatever they say or think. I hate them and some- 
times I hate the Church; either it's hard and nar- 
row, or else it's worldly.' She stopped at the ex- 
pression on her father's face, the most strange look 
of pain, and horror, as if an unspoken treachery of 
his own had been dragged forth for his inspection." 

Noel's tragedy reveals tellingly the tremendous 
disproportion of our emphasis on social sanction, on 
mere legality in marriage and birth. But Noel, in 
some sort, finds harbor. It is the figure of her 



father which in the end remains before 1 us, pathetic 
and ineffectual, " tall, upright, and thin in his grey 
parsonical suit on whose black kerseymere vest a lit- 
tle gold cross dangled." His own daughters he can- 
not reach or help, his congregation has rejected him 
in highly unchristian fashion. And at the front 
where he hopes at last to find opportunity for simple, 
helpful comradeship, the dying Tommy who knows 
himself going West can yet show a flicker of humor, 
of ironic question, at Pierson's fervent " To God, 
my dear son ! " 

Through the lips of the Belgian refugee artist the 
author has perhaps put his finger squarely on the 
pathetic fallacy of clericalism. " Frankly, mon- 
sieur, do you not feel that with every revelation of 
your soul and feelings virtue goes out of you? And 
I will tell you why, if you will not think it an of- 
fense. In opening your hearts you feel that you lose 
authority. You are officers and must never forget 
that. Is it not so? " 

THE FIREBRAND OF BOLSHEVISM. By 
Princess Catherine Radziwill. 293 pages. 
Small, Maynard. 

VOLLEYS- FROM A NON-COMBATANT. By 
William Rbscoe 'Thayer. 322 pages. Double- 
day, Page. 

AFTER THE WHIRLWIND. By Charles Edward 
Russell. 317 pages. Doran. 
REVOLUTIONARY DAYS. By Princess Can- 
tacuzene. 411 pages. Small, Maynard. 

Absolute truth, like Wordsworth's violet, is 
shy. Especially in this avalanche of Russian prop- 
aganda the reader must peer diligently under a 
great many mossy stones before he can hope to find 
any semblance of the actual facts involved. A 
book of substantiated material presenting the Rus- 
sian situation, building itself up through accurate 
definitions of certain fundamentals to understand- 
ing Bolsheviki and soviet, would be invaluable 
aid. But it is not forthcoming. Everyone who 
writes about Russia has a preconceived prejudice or 
a desire to influence opinion or both. When the 
truth is sought in a book like Princess Radziwili's 
The Firebrand of Bolshevism the task is particu- 
larly discouraging, for her account is an unsuccess- 
ful attempt to romanticize international intrigue, 
and it results in a hopeless muddle of vague per- 
sonalities and vaguer transactions. The one unmis- 
takable point is that the author is. loyal to the old 
czarist regime and hates Bolshevism. Mr. Thayer 
.is frank about a similar hatred in his hysterical 
volleys directed at the Russian revolutionists and 
their allies, the Germans; and it was to prove, 
surely, that he recognized the combined danger 
when most Americans .were waiting watchfully 
that his volume is published, for certainly it can 
have no other reason for publication. It is a col- 
lection of heterogeneous essays which may have 
been valuable at the time of original periodical 
printing but are now unwelcome echoes of that

war-hate we have placed, for the time at least, 
behind us. Charles Edward Russell is less excit- 
able. Where Mr. Thayer attacks Bolshevism as 
a Rooseveltian nationalist and Princess Radziwill 
attacks it as a czarist-ioyalist, Mr. Russell espouses 
the same cause as a good old-fashioned socialist. 
All in all, it is a question whether or not the prop- 
agandists are attaining their ends; for the fear of 
Bolshevism by nations and individuals has grown 
instead of shrunk. It reminds one of the psycho- 
logical theory that a man is afraid because his hair 
is standing on end, his teeth chattering, and his 
heart pounding unnaturally. Princess Radziwill, 
Mr. Thayer, and Mr. Russell are missionaries; but 
Princess Cantacuzene, although she does hoe a row 
for the Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaivitch, is 
more interested in presenting a calm report of her 
experiences during revolutionary days. As such it 
can well serve as a source of historical material. 
It is naively aristocratic. Her picture of the Rus- 
sian nobility may show the heavy touch of sym- 
pathy, but it is also illuminating. And her writ- 
ing is refreshing; it is a relief to find an author 
discussing the Russian situation who .does not use 
words so loosely, as do Princess Radziwill, Mr. 
Thayer, and Mr. Russell, as to consider that Bol- 
shevist, anarchist, and Jew are synonymous. The 
difficulty with books of this type is that they are 
partisan, and impossible of any degree of uni- 
versality. They are a means, not an end. They 
are propaganda, not literature, and hence have 
little business with truth, which is, in them, even 
more than half hidden from the eye. 

THE PRELUDE To BOLSHEVISM. By A. F. 
Kerensky. 312 pages. Dodd, Mead. 

For a few months this young Jewish lawyer, A. F. 
Kerensky, had the eyes of the world centered upon 
him. Every word that he urged was reprinted in 
thousands of newspapers. Every time that he was 
ill millions of people held their breaths and won- 
dered what would become of Russia. He had 
helped to overthrow Czarism, he slept in the Czar's 
bed, and he held the responsiblity for a democratic 
Russian state. At the time many believed that vic- 
tory or defeat in the great war hung by the slender 
thread of Kerensky's ability to maintain the war 
morale of his nation. 

In this book, The Prelude to Bolshevism, he sub- 
mits the theory that Bolshevism conquered in Russia 
because of the Korniloff uprising, which so under- 
mined the Kerensky government that the Reds had 
no difficulty in accomplishing their coup d'etat of 
November 7, 1917. He says: "An adventure of a 
small group was transformed in the inflamed im- 
agination of the masses to a conspiracy of the whole 
of -the bourgeoisie and of all the upper classes 
against democracy and the working masses. " This 
spark of fear was blown by the Bolsheviki into the 
flame of rebellion, and the successful Red revolt 
followed. 



The volume consists of a report of the investiga- 
tion of Kerensky's part in the Korniloff incident be- 
fore a Commission of Inquiry, edited by himself 
with full use of the editorial prerogative. It is de- 
tailed to a degree, and not squeamish about being 
repetitious. Historians will consider it valuable as 
a source of facts and opinions. But the casual 
reader who has retained mental pictures of Keren- 
sky the Russian dictator will be somewhat disap- 
pointed. Kerensky is so eager to prove the guilt of 
Korniloff that he depreciates in value himself. 
There are no revelations here of that personality 
which commanded the attention of all nations, no 
oratory, no brilliant statesmanship, no political 
idealism that is new. This is the wordy legal docu- 
ment of a man protecting his human reputation. 

TRAILING THE BOLSHEVIKI. By Carl W. 
Ackerman. 308 pages. Scribner. 

The determination of a group of Republican 
senators to pare the Shantung situation to the core 
brings attention to the alarming lack of current in- 
formation on the Far East. Japanese censorship, 
as skilfully unsparing as that of the other Allies, 
has carefully prevented accurate or complete data 
from reaching the American press. Yet, although 
even the most idealistic of the statesmen have for- 
saken open covenants openly arrived at, the public 
still rather emphatically demands cold facts upon 
which to base opinion. And th'e cold facts from 
the Far East have a chill all their own. 

This volume by staff correspondent of the New 
York Times, who graciously confesses to having 
followed the serpentine trail of the Bolsheviki 
through Russia, Germany, Seattle, Chicago, France, 
Switzerland, Austria, Mexico, and Spain is timely 
because it offers for examination some of the facts 
concerning Allied and Japanese policies in Siberia. 
Although nine-tenths of the book is devoted to the 
theory that Bolshevism is a failure in Russia and 
merely socialism outside of Russia the remaining 
tenth, with its analysis of the Far East problem, 
justifies the publication. 

That is, the publication is justified for those who 
did not know that Japan sent seventy thousand, 
troops into Siberia instead of a pledged seven thou- 
sand, that Japanese agents, soldiers, merchants, in- 
vestigators overran Siberia, that at one time no 
caravan could go in or out of Manchuria, Mon- 
golia, or Siberia without the consent of Japanese 
guards, that Japan prevented an Allied manage- 
ment of the Trans-Siberian railroad, or that the 
militarists may at any time overthrow the " peace 
party " now in control and make of Shantung an- 
other cause for a world war. Ackerman's discus- 
sion of the Russian political melee can be disregarded 
without loss. He is essentially the journalist, to 
whom the fate of the czar is immeasurably more 
fascinating than the development of political forms 
through experiments conducted in a nation of mil- 
lions of souls. The romantic history of the Czecho-

MODERN JAPAN. By Amos S. and Susane 
W. Hershey. 382 pages. Bobbs-Merrill. 

The impression which one gets from reading this 
book, which is like a searchlight upon economic 
conditions and many varied problems of life in 
Nippon, is that the Japanese are likely to die of self 
conceit. Of this commodity, islanders have the 
reputation, even to a proverb, of possessing an over- 
plus. It is true that in all books on Japan, there 
is an indefinable something that differentiates them 
as written either by long residents or visitors. Pro- 
fessor Hershey, however, having written on the 
diplomacy of the Russo-Japanese war, pierces below 
the surface of things, and the woman's eyes see 
reality, as well as romance. At Europe, in Korea, 
as well as at home, Japan is on trial before the world 
and this study, in white light, will help the judicial 
reader to appraise rightly the civilization that Claims 
equality with that of the leading nations. It may 
be that standards of living, moral and economic, 
may furnish better data for judgment than what 
tourists seek for their amusement. One gets the 
impression that the old -plan of invoking the "em- 
peror," as a panacea is rapidly becoming impotent 
if not obsolescent. 



NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE WORLD 
WAR. By Frederick A. Ogg and Charles A. 
Beard. 603 pages. Macmillan. 

With the collaboration of Professor Ogg and 
Mr. Beard in their new book, National Govern- 
ments and the World War, we have another 
announcement that America and the rest of the 
world are no longer political strangers; and that 
an appreciation of American political institutions 
is dependent upon an understanding of the organ- 
ization of governments other than our own. In 
the present work the union of effort, as far as it 
goes, is a happy one; for both authors view the 
world of politics and government through essen- 
tially American lenses. The result of their efforts 
is a text book not long enough to become unpopu- 
lar, but far too short to be a complete survey of the 
subject. While Professor Ogg's exposition of the 
development of constitutions and of the govern- 
ments in some of the larger states engaged in the 
war may explain, in part, the haggling of the peace 
delegates; and Mr. Beard's elucidation of the 
changes in government organization in America may 
help us to restrain our impatience and withhold 
our judgment on the work of the Peace Confer- 
ence, neither of them brings forward any sugges- 



tions for the solution of the particular problems 
facing the various governments of the world. 
Moreover, Professor Ogg, in his division of the 
work, has limited his exposition to the governments 
of Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, Italy, Bel- 
gium, and Great Britain and her colonies. Why 
Russia was omitted is inconceivable, unless Mr. 
Ogg would have us believe that his treatment of 
one autocratic government sufficed for the pur- 
poses of the book. If this was his viewpoint, the 
omission becomes inexcusable, as the book is essen- 
tially a text book, and the date of publication is 
1919. The authors could have performed a more 
satisfactory service for students of politics and gov- 
ernment by bringing out new editions of their pre- 
vious works and embodying therein all the recent 
developments in experimental government. With 
such a plan, their work could have withstood the 
charge of superficiality. 

THE MASTERY OF THE FAR EAST: The 
Story of Korea and Japan's Rise to Supremacy 
in the Far East. By Arthur Judson Brown. 
671 pages. Scribner. 

The characteristic note in this illuminating 
volume is sympathy with judicial impartiality. 
An orthodox Presbyterian missionary secretary, who 
is a stalwart in his belief of propaganda of the fun- 
damentals of the Christian faith, talks about Con- 
fucianists, Shintoists, and Buddhists, as if they were 
men and brothers. Like the Revised Version, he 
leaves out the word " heathen " and uses the term 
" nations." Two visits in recent years sufficed for 
his impressions, but for a quarter of a century he 
has disciplined himself to hear all sides and be a 
judge of diverse opinions and claims. 

Though in the language of old archery, he " claps 
the clout," in striking the exact moment for news 
value, when Korea is in a state of uprising, this 
book is the result of long preparation, and without 
any sign of haste. In his view, Korea is the strategic 
point in the Far East. He is a compiler in describing 
history of people and civilization of the ancient 
peninsula, now a province of Japan and her Ire- 
land. . The Japanese may conquer these unarmed 
people by force, but they can never bind the Korean 
intellect. Concerning battles between the pen and 
the sword, history has but one answer. Part Two 
outlines the history for possession: China and Rus- 
sia being the other two powers besides Japan that 
coveted Naboth's vineyard. In Part Three the 
horrors of Japanese imperialism real, biting, 
poisonous are consciously, or otherwise, shown. 
In Part Four, discussing the place and potency of 
Christian Missions in the Far East, the author is 
at his best. He has a statesmanlike grasp of the 
whole situation. Yet on the whole, he justi- 
fies the Japanese, and this without a trace of 
partisanship. With them rests the mastery of 
the Far East.

SOCIOLOGY AND RELIGION 

Social Evolution and the Development of Religion 

By CARL K. MAHONEY 
Introduction by W. J. THOMPSON 

Preachers must, of course, shake hands and smile 
and raise Conference apportionments and more. 
The crying need, however loud enough to split 
the dome of heaven is for preachers to know the 
great things of the Kingdom; life, man and God 
in terms of to-day. Then to practice their beliefs 
in their lives and translate them into deeds of so- 
ciety, that both they and society may be served. 
This book learnedly, clearly, and truthfully sets 
forth basic principles. He who understands, ac- 
cepts, and proceeds upon them will impart a 
larger knowledge of the world that is above him, 
and make effective strokes in transforming the 
world around him into one whose governments 
are righteous, whose industries are just, and 
whose social order is Christlike.

military victory of the Allies has ended one phase 
of the World War, but the complete intellectual 
and moral victory is yet to be won. The menace 
of materialism, with its denial of morality and its 
worship of brute force, still hangs over the world 
and threatens its higher life. The task of the 
next generation is to uproot this cult of materialism 
that has insinuated itself into so many charinels of 
national activity.

THE BRITISH IN CAPRI, 1806-1808. By Sir 
Lees Knowles. 330 pages. Lane. 

The historian owes at least a word of thanks to 
anyone who will go to the trouble and expense of 
putting into print anything in the nature of his- 
torical material which is not otherwise readily 
accessible. So much is due to Sir Lees Knowles 
for this collection throwing light upon the occupa- 
tion of Capri by the British during the wars against 
Napoleon. It is true that his collection does not 
even pretend to be exhaustive. Perhaps it is too 
much to expect that in the midst of a world war 
he should have undertaken to exploit the state 
archives in London or in Paris. At any rate he 
has not done so, though he does include one val- 
uable anonymous journal of the British attack 
upon Capri in 1806 from a manuscript in the Brit- 
ish Museum. For the most part he has contented 
himself with material already in print without 
much attempt to deal with it in a critical spirit. 
In the case of the anonymous journal for instance, 
he takes no pains either to discover its author 01 
to test its accuracy. Still if anyone is curious to 
know about the details of a tenth-rate military 
operation of ephemeral significance Sir Lees 
Knowles has furnished much excellent matter to 
that end. 

THE PIONEERS OF THE OLD SOUTH. By Mary 

Johnston. 251 pages. Yale University Press. 

The name of Mary Johnston on the title page 
of this fifth volume of The Chronicles of America 
Series, is the guaranty of a very readable book; but 
any criticism that goes beyond the manner in which 
the story is toH must note grave deficiencies . in the 
work as a piece of historical writing. Miss John- 
ston, after the manner of the novelist, selects her 
material, expands or contracts her narrative, retains 
or dismisses her characters with the artist's preoc- 
cupation with vividness and plot, rather than with 
the historian's devotion to the search for adequate 
causes in an apparently unmotivated continuity of 
events. Incidents which give a large opportunity 
for the dramatic use of personalities like John Smith, 
Somers, Bacon, Spottwood, the author dwells on at 
length, while she neglects the political and social 
conditions in England out of which the emigration 
grew as well as the political and economic institu- 
tions which the settlers built up in their new home. 
One can see no trace of Bruce or Beer or Osgood in 
Miss Johnston's work. A book need not be dull to be 
scholarly, but certainly, more -than cleverness of 
narrative is needed to redeem a book from the re- 
proach of superficiality. 

The editor comes gallantly to his author's rescue, 
now and then, with a footnote interpreting her in- 
difference to scientific scholarship as the reluctance 
of mind delicately poised between conflicting 
theories to commit itself. He also supplies a brief 
appendix on the^Navigation Laws, which the author 



neglects. This shoring up of the narrative with 
critical timber is a poor witness to the solidity of its 
foundation. In addition to this the work is poorly 
proportioned. Although it is supposed to cover 
the history of all the Southern colonies from their 
foundation down to the middle of the i8th century, 
it is practically a history of Virginia under the 
Stuart Kings. Maryland has less than forty of the 
two hundred and fifty-one pages, and the Carolinas 
and Georgia are dismissed with the meager chap- 
ters of thirteen and twelve pages respectively, ad 
finem. The author dwells so long on the pic- 
turesque incidents in the colonial history of Virginia 
that she often has to dispose of considerable periods 
of time and events of great importance in a few 
ejaculatory sentences that sound like stage directions. 



THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS: THE PRINCIPLE

disarmament, the international protection of labor, 
the Monroe Doctrine, all the controversial issues 
which have been raised in connection with the 
Covenant are treated in considerable detail. On the 
whole, the various collaborators agree pretty closely 
in their conclusions. They believe that, while no 
power is willing to surrender any traditional attri- 
butes of sovereignty to a superstate, the time has 
come when effective international control can be 
exercised over war and the causes which lead to war. 
So far as the Covenant itself is concerned they admit 
that it is not ideal, but plead that it is jhe only 
alternative to the state of international anarchy 
which was primarily responsible for the war. They 
lay stress upon its provisions for arbitration and for 
the compulsory publication of treaties. They con- 
tend that these stipulations will do much to elimi- 
nate secret diplomacy and to prevent wars from 
springing up in the heat of the moment. They make 
out a reasonably strong and plausible case for the 
League as against the old system with its inevitable 
accompaniment of aggressive nationalism and crush- 
ing competitive armaments. However, there are 
certain stubborn and unmistakable facts which tend 
to invalidate many of the theoretical conclusions of 
the book. In the first place, the political sins of 
the Peacy Treaty, as expressed in the decisions re- 
garding the Saar, West Prussia, the Tyrol, German 
Bohemia, and Shantung, constitute a grave objection

SHANTUNG ! 

Yesterday, just one of a million of places in

of Nations as it stands. . 

Is it the sudden flare of a day? 

Behind Shantung is the great big question of

tung unless you understand what is back of it.

The American MAGAZINE on the Orient 

This magazine is the authority for information on Eastern questions. It will give you 
a cogent background for understanding the Eastern problems which will flame into big 
newspaper headlines apparently without cause. 

ASIA, richly illustrated, is the only general 
magazine published in the United States treating 
exclusively of Oriental matters. 

Popular opinion is for a League of Nations as a 
step forward in settling international quarrels. 
ASIA is for the League of Nations as a profound 
advance in civilization. 

But there is one tremendous new obligation 
the League of Nations puts upon the American 
people and that is that we who have been un- 
trammelled by the centuries of outworn tradi- 
tion that hare held Europe back, must see that 
the League is not made merely a. cloak for the 
same old unscrupulous diplomacy which was 
the very root of war. 



Only can America do this if you, the maker of 
American public opinion, inform yourself about 
the great Orient which is the hotbed of interna- 
tional trouble in the future. China's affairs are 
our affairs Japan's interests affect our interests 
Near Eastern matters have become our respon- 
sibility. No longer can we stand aloof. 

ASIA brings the Orient to you. Not dry-as 
dust discussion, but through vivid articles con- 
tributed by authorities telling the story of funda- 
mental international currents, in personal inti- 
mate style, illustrated with remarkable photo- 
graphs and reproductions of paintings. Each 
issue contains an average of ten articles and is 
profusely illustrated with from fifty to sixty re- 
productions.

to an institution which, in its present form, seems 
designed to uphold a rigid status quo. Moreover 
the course of recent events in Hungary demonstrates 
quite clearly that the League, at the present time, 
is quite incapable even of preserving the status quo, 
against the aggressive designs of a small state which 
is not easily blockaded and which enjoyei thf secret 
sympathy of one or more of the great powers. The 
collaborators of Dr. Duggan's book have given an 
excellent exposition of the machinery of the League 
of Nations. They have suggested a number of 
possible improvements in this machinerv. But it 
should always be remembered that the best con- 
ceivable machinery for international cooperation and 
conciliation will never function effectively unless 
the strong nations which are chiefly responsible for 
its operation are willing to apply it honestly and 
fearlessly, regardless of their own special selfish 
interests. 



CIVILIZATION. By Ellen N. La Motte. 267 
pages. Doran. 

There is a very definite effect attained in these 
short stories an effect derived from the rigorous 
exclusion of all non-essentials and from an undeviat- 
ing fidelity to mood. Miss La Motte understands 
the value of tone, and these brief tales some of 
them scarcely more than sketches have a simplicity 
of style that is so adroit as to conceal the art which 
makes it possible. Her pen weaves pictures which 
have the grace of a single bud in a vase; there is 
proportion rather than profusion. In her handling 
of words, she has an odd knack of doubling back 
over significant sentences, repeating them with but 
the slightest variation and yet with no sense of mere 
monotony. She is sparing of quotation marks, and 
the descriptive and narrative passages are seldom 
broken by dialogue. The material of these tales is 
chiefly the physical and spiritual contacts of the 
white man with the older, elemental civilization of 
the East. Through her ability to suggest more than 
she puts into words, she is enabled to compress what 
might easily assume of the dimensions of a long story 
into the limits of a sketch. Miss La Motte is intent 
upon those subtle transformations of character and 
those inner revolts which sprang from the interming- 
ling of antagonistic races, and her skill in impres- 
sionistic narrative gives these tales a significance 
which lifts them above the rut of contemporary short 
fiction. 



THE NEXT STEP IN RELIGION: An Essay 
Towards the Coming Renaissance. By Roy 
Wood Sellars. 228 pages. Macmillan. 

" The center of gravity of religion has been 
openly changing for some time now from super- 
naturalism to what may best be called humanistic 
naturalism." Dr. Sellars traces, in a flowing con- 
ciliatory style, the past and present of this process: 



finds the origins of supernaturalism in the impotence 
of primitive man nature being worshiped where 
she cannot be controlled ; and attributes the decay of 
supernaturalism to the development of man's knowl- 
edge and power. Nature is like any other feminine 
not worshiped once she has been known. Along 
with this theological debacle has gone a domestica- 
tion of ideals: Heaven has become Utopia, to be 
sought no longer by prayers to God but by tele- 
grams to the President. Religion is to mean devo- 
tion to goodness, beauty, truth ; " selfish luxury will 
be scorned, property subordinated to welfare, eco- 
nomic fear lessened to the utmost, knowledge unen- 
viously exalted, and art called into service." This 
capacity of man to feel devotion is the noble element 
in the beast; for nourishing it religion may some 
day have her crimes forgotten. Morality alone 
the restriction of self-seeking within social bounds 
will not suffice; it must be touched with devotion. 
Religion is morality on fire ; " loyalty to the values 
of life." All this is well said, and almost too good 
to be true, coming out of a university. Perhaps 
men will continue to base their religious beliefs on 
desire rather than on fact ; perhaps our fitful flicker- 
ing egos will still reach out for. immortality, and 
will find some " new thought " in which to escape 
the cut and glare of truth. At all events it is a 
pleasant discussion a cheering relief from free 
trade with high tariffs, open diplomacy behind 
closed doors, and Peace Conferences without peace. 

A YEAR IN THE NAVY. By Joseph Husband. 
1 80 pages. Houghton Mifflin. 

This is a description of a wonderful Platonic 
navy, administered by guardians and philosophers. 
It will seem to most late members of that establish- 
ment like News from Nowhere. Some particular 
ship or station, one some particular day, might, God 
willing, function like the Great Lakes Station that 
the author has selectively described with painstaking 
cheerfulness. But such days and such stations are 
still few and far between. Sick Bays where an ap- ' 
plication to be put on the Binnacle List is not re- 
prehended as a crime, ship's cooks whose meals are 
invariably " distinctly good," and petty officers that 
delight only in harmless bullying shades of New- 
port! where do these exist? Life in the navy under 
the terms of the new two-year enlistment is in the 
main good enough for a youth not to be depicted as 
a miraculous practise of the perfections. On the sea 
one encounters foid weather as well as fair, and the 
navy itself has the quality of its native element. A 
boy of spirit can face both extremes without quak- 
ing: what mak^s his cruise difficult is the doldrums. 
Why not tell something of the seamier side of naval 
life, a side which lingers in the new navy, and which 
dominated the old? Happy the recruit who learns 
on his first hitch that that hardships, brutalities, and 
disappointments are godsends, to the extent that they 
take the edge of monotony.

Books of the Fortnight 

The Remaking of a Mind, by Henry de Man (289 
pages; Scribner), recapitulates the issues that the 
younger generation has left behind and endeavors 
to evaluate the current movements for world recon- 
struction with the aid of the light furnished by the 
war. The author is a young Belgian who partici- 
pated equally in the labor struggle and the war 
struggle, and who is qualified by study and resi- 
dence in half a dozen countries to present the views 
of the International Man. Review later. 

Addresses in America: 1919, by John Galsworthy (109 
pages; Scribner), is a fragmentary collection of the 
author's thoughts which hardly does justice to him 
as an essayist. One finds in Mr. Galsworthy's plea 
for certain social advances a curious lack of pro- 
portion which permits him to couple the abolition of 
smoke with the reduction of working hours and the 
rescue of educational forces from the grip of vested 
interests. 

Russia's Ruin, by E. H. Wilcox (316 pages; Scribner), 
repeats well-known, old facts about Russia, presented 
to the reader in a rather one-sided manner. The 
author has been an observer of Russia for several 
years and has assimilated the political mind of the 
" moderate rights," who in the forces of revolution 
were driven almost to extreme right wing. The Russian 
Revolution is not explained by this book: It illustrates 
rather the psychology of those groups who have lost 
their influence, and portrays that ideology which takes 
refuge in moribund principles. 

The Far East Unveiled, by Frederic Coleman (304 pages ? 
Houghton Miffiin), is "an inner history of events in 
Japan and China in the year 1916 " ; as such it 
may serve as an introduction to the study of an 
Oriental relationship that becomes each day of more 
interest to America. 

Standing By, by Robert Keable (271 pages; Button), 
is made up, so the sub-title says, of " war-time reflec- 
tions in France and Flanders " ; examination shows 
that these reflections are caught up in a murky mir- 
ror where one would be content enough to leave them. 

Select Cases Before the King's Council, edited by I. S. 
Leadam and J. F. Baldwin (156 pages; Harvard 
University Press), is Vol. XXXVI of the Selden So- 
ciety's Publications, devoted to reprints of significant 
source cases in early English law. 

The Sober World, by Randolph Wellford Smith (291 
pages; Marshall Jones), is an altogether timely, quite 
readable, and undeniably entertaining recital of the 
march toward prohibition. The writer blames na- 
tional unpreparedness on Congressional drinking, 
asserts that Bolshevism had its birth in the saloon, 
and declares that at times " drink has nearly eaten 
away the very heart of the British Empire." His 
indictment is couched in such lurid terms that the 
Rev. Billy Sunday could use it verbatim. Drink is 
dead, and Mr. Smith heaps abuse on its grave. 

Christian Americanization, by Charles Alvin Brooks 
(162 pages; Missionary Education Movement, New 
York), discusses the problem of Americanization in 
terms of militant Christianity. The author defines 
Americanization as the achievement of national unity 
for world service upon the plane of our highest 
ideals; but he fails to see the danger of this terri- 
torial unity, fostered chiefly for military purposes, 
to those world-wide cooperations which all men of 
good will must work to promote. 



Thrift and Conservation: How to Teach It, by Arthur 
Henry Chamberlain and James Franklin Chamberlain 
(272 pages; Lippincott, Philadelphia), essays to pro- 
vide the teacher with suggestions and data on the 
subject of national and personal economy. A bibli- 
ography at the end of some of the more important 
chapters repairs to some extent the sketchiness of the 
authors' treatment. 

Daniel De Leon : The Man and His Work, A Symposium 
(186 pages; National Executive Committee, Socialist 
Labor Party), recounts the career of this extraordi- 
narily interesting man from the time that he left his 
lectureship in International Law at Columbia through 
the period that led to his final recognition by Lenin 
as the greatest mind devoted to Socialism since Marx. 
De Leon awakened intense animosity and intense ad- 
miration, and the present work has the partisan bias 
of his colleagues and intimates. 

The Years of the Shadow, by Katharine Tynan (343 
pages; Houghton Miffiin), gives the recent literary 
and political gossip of North Ireland with the inimi- 
table brilliance of a clever Irish woman. The chap- 
ters having to do with the Rebellion are especially 
noteworthy. Review later. 

Contact with the Other World: The Latest Evidence as 
to Communication with the Dead, by James H. Hyslop 
(493 pages, illustrated; Century), summarizes recent 
data having to do with psychic research. Of value 
to those who require something other than emotional 
excitement in considering the problem of spirit 
communication. 

The Hill of Vision, by Frederick Bligh (134 pages; 
Marshall Jones), possesses exceptional interest for 
those seeking a symbolic content for the war just 
closed. The volume consists of prophesies and inter- 
pretations obtained by means of automatic writing 
through the same agency as those recorded in The 
Gate of Remembrance, which led to the discovery 
of the Chapel of King Edgar at Glastonbury. There 
is an introduction by Ralph Adams Cram. 

How the Bible Grew, by Frank G. Lewis (224 pages; 
University of Chicago Press), popularizes and dig- 
nifies a cultural study of the Bible as literature in 
tracing the story of its growth from sources embedded 
within the book itself. He traces it out as one 
might explore a river from its 'full, broad stream 
back and back till the brooks and springs differentiate 
themselves. He really succeeds in putting into a 
simple style the romance of the development of the 
Bible from the Song of Deborah to the American 
Revised Version. This book will ably contribute 
its part to the colossal modern task of dissipating the 
unreal atmosphere which has made difficult a sen- 
sible view of the book of books. 

The Bengali Book of English Verse, selected by Theo- 
dore Douglas Dunn (119 pages; Longmans, Green), 
contains poems in English by seventeen Bengali 
writers, a foreword by Tagore, and the editor's intro- 
duction, which seems to offer the collection as an 
evidence of the success of English education in India. 
If that was his purpose, he should have spared his 
pains, for the verses representing a century of effort 
are merely exercises, more or less crude, in outworn 
Western modes. The two or three exceptions that 
have an authentic charm are the work of poets who 
were educated in Western capitals. 

Verses Wise and Otherwise, by M. Nightingale (63 
pages; Longmans, Green), is a slender volume, 
chiefly of nature poems. Simple themes are simply 
treated; there are no lofty flights.

A List of Eighty-seven Poets (15 pages; Syracuse Pub- 
lic Library, N. Y.), collects bibliographical data and 
snips samples from the works of a list of American 
poets whose verses have appeared between 1900 and 
1919. The catalogue is so far an improvement over 
that of the Poetry Society that Lowell, Oppenheim, 
Neihardr; Masters are represented but Aiken is in- 
explicably absent. 

Old Masters and New, by Robert Lynd (249 pages; 
Scribner), does for this young Englishman's contem- 
poraries and ancestors what Hazlitt's essays did a 
century ago, and in a manner whose likeness does 
not carry with it the stigma of inferiority. Review 
later. , 

Percolator Papers, by Ellwood Hendrick (259 pages; 
Harper), is a collection of scholarly, benedictory es- 
says on various themes, reprints from magazines and 
from the official bulletin of the Chemists' Club. Mr. 
Hendrick sees life amiably, tranquilly; his pen be- 
tokens a mind as neat and as untrammeled as a 
clipped hedge. 

The Moon and Sixpence, by W. Somerset Maugham 
(314 pages; Doran), is probably the most important 
novel of recent years. It is the story of a man in 
whom the artistic impulse quickened at middle age, 
sweeping him into the chaos of creative realization 
and personal oblivion. The story is told with acrid 
beauty and satiric penetration into the remoter re- 
gions of human consciousness. Review later. 

The Pale Horse, by " Ropshin " (B. V. Savinkov; 180 
pages; Knopf), gives the author of What Never 
Happened the opportunity to " liquidate " his faith 
in the creative energy of the revolutionary democ- 
racy. Review later. 

Mare Nostrum, by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (518 pages; 
Button), a companion volume to The Four Horsemen 
of the Apocalypse, and better known in Europe, em- 
ploys the Mediterranean, with its rich Latin asso- 
ciations, as background for the contemporary war 
plot. Review later. 

Mummery, by Gilbert Cannan (280 pages; Doran), will 
disappoint readers familiar with the author's earlier 
work. This is a story of personal relationships be- 
tween an artist (Gordon Craig?) and his actress 
wife. Determined to catch the romantic atmosphere 
of " Bohemia," Mr. Cannan introduces all the busi- 
ness of the theater, London attics, book-shops, and 
studios. He fails to catch the spontaneous mood of 
Soho, quite as he fails to penetrate the psychology 
of personal relationships. The story just misses 
throughout. 

The Street of Adventure, by Philip Gibbs (437 pages; 
Dutton), brings to the American reader a novel 
which has long been the modern English classic of 
Fleet Street. It is an essentially human story written 
with the clear vision and power which placed the 
author far ahead of all other war correspondents. 

Rezanov, by Gertrude Atherton (254 pages; Boni & 
Liveright), published in 1906 and a recent addition 
to The Modern Library, reminds us that Mrs. Ather- 
ton has not yet given up the literature that this 
charming, though somewhat amateurish, " historical 
idyll" seemed to promise so strongly; in fact, that 
its effect is even now visible beneath the enthusiastic 
assurance of William Marion Reedy's introduction 
to this reprint. 



Heritage, by V. Sackville West (320 pages; Doran), is a 
promising novel by a new author who handles a 
complex problem in a vital way. There is atmos- 
phere as well as action, and although at times Mr. 
West sees his subject through slightly befogged 
lenses, he has fashioned an interesting study. 

The Promises of Alice, by Margaret Deland (131 pages; 
Harper), is a parsonic romance, in which the char- 
acters are more orthodox than real. 

The Girl in the Mirror, by Elizabeth Jordan (297 pages; 
Century), is very light fiction in which the author 
takes up some of the plot strands which she dropped 
in Wings of Youth. There is mystery in it, but mys- 
tery of the purely artificial, staged sort, patterned 
upon Seven Keys to Baldpate. 

The Lady of the Crossing, by Frederick Niven (317 
pages; Doran), is a western novel without gun-play, 
In Chapter I of Part III, the author calls it a " sunny- 
book," and the fact that he is aware of it is a. 
sufficient characterization of the contents. 

Silver and Gold, by Dane Coolidge (260 pages; Dut- 
ton), is a western novel which steers a careful course 
over a tried channel. It concerns itself with love, 
villainy, and the fulfillment of a prophecy three 
elements adroitly blended, and made to serve as the 
groundwork for considerable action. 

The Branding Iron, by Katharine Newlin Bun (310 
pages; Houghton Mifflin), is a romance crammed 
with action and elementary passion a story quite a 
engagingly incredible as it is undeniably entertain- 
ing. It is written with skill, and with a quickening 
vigor that grips the attention. Perhaps the most 
deadly criticism which can be aimed at it is em- 
bodied in Rex Beach's endorsement on the jacket, 
when he says that it will make a great movie. 

When the World Shook, by H. Rider Haggard (407 
pages, Longmans, Green), has for its locus in quo 
an uncharted South Sea island, under the spell of 
whose mystery the survivors of a shipwreck are har- 
ried through a series of fantastic experiences to the 
climactic discovery of the incarnation of the recently 
lost wife of one of them in a native girl. This 
latest product of a prolific pen has a conscientious 
consistency. 

Mr. Standfast, by John Buchan (374 pages; Doran), 
brings once more on the stage Dick Hannay and Peter 
Pienaar, of Greenmantle and of The Thirty-nine 
Steps. A war novel, it leads the reader through spy 
adventures in England to the battlefields of France, 
where (on the last page) Peter dies, and receives a 
Bunyan epitaph. 

After Thirty, by Julian Street (273 pages; Century), is 
adroit philandering fiction, not to be taken seriously. 
Even the most agile churning of skimmed emotions 
becomes tiresome, if one is really looking for butter. 

Burned Bridges, by Berfrrand W. Sinclair (308 pages; 
Little, Brown), opens in the Canadian Northwest and 
shifts to the coast. The aruthor is rather more cer- 
tain in his geography than in his psychology. 

The Owner of the Lazy D, by William Patterson White 
(324 pages; Little, Brown), is a Western tale in 
which a " not too distant " rifle cracks in the second 
paragraph, and thereby sets the example for all en- 
suing thrills.

The great war of armies has ended. But the greater 
struggle for freedom of thought and expression has only 
begun. 

Men of good will in every country are gathering for 
the battle for a great ideal. 

But that the objective may be gained, it is imperative 
that there be concerted action. 

Defective understanding of the problems of one 
brigade by another will retard the advance. 

The intelligence, and, above all, the liaison system 
must be as nearly perfect as possible.

MODERN GERMANY 

Her PoliticaPand Economic Problems, By J. ELLIS BARKER 
Sixth Edition. Entirely^iRewritten and Greatly Enlarged 

This, the sixth, edition of one of the classic economic histories of Germany, her people and her government, is 
practically a new book. The older editions had to be superseded, not because their conclusions were proved 
wrong, but because their forecasts were proved right. The earlier chapters of the work, therefore, have been 
entirely rewritten, and what was of value in them, the studies of the sources of Germany's strength and weakness 
under Prussian domination, has been retained ; the later chapters have been rewritten as history rather than 
prophecy ; and seven important new chapters have been added, culminating in " The Future of Germany " and 
" The Problem of Austria." This is the kind of forecast, based on accurate knowledge and clear thinking, that 
is of real val;ue to all those who are trying to solve national problems at the present time, and that will survive 
the severe tests of the events of the next few years. Net, $6.00

in making education an instrument with which to enslave a great nation." New York 8un. Net, $4.00 

New Schools for Old By EVELYN DEWEY 

The book is an interesting account of the application by Mrs. Harvey or community ideals to the regenera- 
tion of the Porter School, a one-room, run-down country school in Missouri. Its problems were used as the 
starting-point for the development of a healthy community spirit. It is the record of one of the most 
important and successful educational experiments of the century.

ten, relieved by bits of verse that are crisp and vital. Net, $2.00 

Helping France By RUTH GAINES 

" This story of the Red Cross in the devastated area, written by a member of the Smith College unit, looks 
both backward and forward backward over the wonderful human record of the organization in the relief 
of suffering during the stress of war, and forward to the great tasks of reclamation and reconstruction. 
The principles and methods that governed the Red Cross work in France have never been more clearly 
stated in any popular work." Review of Reviews. Net, $2.00 

What America Did By FLORENCE FINCH KELLY 

A record of the country at war of America's prodigious efforts in preparing for war and waging it; of the 
tremendous energy with which an essentially peace-loving nation girded Itself against the menace of mili- 
tarism; of the creation 1 out of practically nothing of an army of millions, a colossal munitions industry, an 
aviation corps second to none in the world; of an invincible spirit of solidarity among the civilian popula- 
tion that responded to every call. 

" Beneath it all there glows an enthusiasm, vigorous and proud, that lifts it far above the ordinary run of 
such writing. In no other book up to date have the many phases of America's stupendous achievement been 
gathered, correlated, and combined eo successfully into a terse flowing narrative as here." New York Times.

described in " A City of the Dawn," and he gives his impressions and reactions in a book remarkable in 
both thought and style. 

" In the past few years we have read many war-books the burden of which was spiritual, but nothing 
. . . that has seemed the equal of this, nothing so blended of the Christian and the churchman. . . . 
Our chief and particular interest is the unusual quality of the book its vivid spirituality, its profoundly 
human meditation, the contrast, ending in harmony, of its experience of humanity and its experience of 
eaintltness." Louisville Evening Post. Net, $8.00

A FORTNIGHTLY 



Industrial Education in the Arsenals 



i 



T is PECULIARLY FORTUNATE at this critical state 
in the rehabilitation of our economic system that the 
workers employed in the large government manu- 
facturing arsenals and the managements of these 
arsenals have at last discovered a fact which, it 
seems, they never quite realized before. They have 
come to see that in these plants a true identity of 
interest exists between the managing group and the 
working group which has in it possibilities for ele- 
vating and perfecting industrial processes and organ- 
izated relationships. Indeed, we seem at last to 
be on our way towards developing an example in the 
technique of conducting industry which holds out a 
real promise. 

The realization of the true alignment of interest 
between the management and the arsenal workers 
seems to have been in process of clarification approxi- 
mately since the entrance of America into the 
great war. Throughout the emergency, especially 
at Rock Island Arsenal, the largest of the five, 
occasional attempts were made to bring about 
closer cooperation between the supervising agents 
and the workers. In some of the shops, mainly 
under the inspiration of patriotism, exceptional re- 
sults in production were secured. The employees, 
through self-selected committees, participated ac- 
tively in the determination of working conditions, 
wages, and, most important of all, matters vitally 
affecting shop and method improvement. Thus in 
isolated cases, which however were none the less 
confidence-breeding, it was demonstrated that there 
were untouched resources, could they but be enlisted 
in the manufacturing and administrative processes 
of the arsenals, which would result in great benefits. 

There is nothing so truly significant about all this 
as the fact that the full import of these latent 
possibilities was most clearly seen and understood by 
the employees themselves. Previous to the Armis- 
tice, when the necessity for production of munitions 
of war was paramount, they took the initiative and 
proposed ways and means for increasing output. 
This is illustrated, among other things, by their 
memorandum to the Secretary of War, in which 
they stated : 

As a result of this (the existence of distrust, the speed- 
ing up of production to their detriment, the cutting of 



piece work prices, etc.) the men found that their only 
recourse was to place a deliberate limit on production; 
thus the aforementioned resourcefulness, ingeniousness 
and ability of the men, instead of being directed into con- 
structive channels for the purpose of improving produc- 
tion, were diverted into methods for limiting production. 
Their experience had taught them that when their in- 
ventive ability was used constructively it would count 
against them because it reduced their earnings or resulted 
sooner or later in discharges or layoffs of their number. 
The normal progress in the purpose for which the shop 
existed was consistently retarded or limited. 

When the United States entered the war and it became 
very apparent that maximum production was of the great- 
est importance, the men in the Leather Shop voluntarily 
agreed to take off the limits which they had placed on 
productivity, providing, however, that piece work prices 
were not reduced without their consent. They felt con- 
strained to insist upon this feature since not only had 
their past experience taught them that they stood a serious 
chance of having their earnings cut, but also that they 
might have to put up with such subterfuges as changes 
in operation for the purpose of providing arguments to 
the management to back up their insistence for reducing 
prices. 

After the Armistice was signed and the demands 
for war necessities declined, the thing of importance 
to the workers became the stability of their posi- 
tions. They quickly saw that work must be secured 
from other sources than the Army if they were not 
to be laid off in droves to become part of the growing 
numbers of unemployed. They appealed to the Sec- 
retary of War, and in their appeal pointed out that 
the arsenals might legitimately be utilized for manu- 
facturing equipment for all departments of the gov- 
ernment as well as for the Army. Further, they 
pointed out that it would be desirable and necessary 
from the point of view of real success in this new 
venture for them to participate in the functioning 
of the central agency and the local organizations 
which would be responsible for securing and turn- 
ing out work. This program was adopted and has 
since May of this year been in the process of active 
development. 

The surprising and important thing that has 
come to the fore in the experience so far gained has 
been the rapidity of the rise in the sense of responsi- 
bility of the workers towards the entire enterprise. 
At bottom their interests, of course, are economic; 
but for the first time, in the truest sense of the 
term, have they come to see that their economic 
interests do not stop with concern for wages and 



232 



THE DIAL 



September 20 



working conditions. They realize that by the estab- 
lishment of the new relationship between themselves 
and the supervision, they of necessity become re- 
sponsible for everything that goes on in these plants. 
Nor is even this, as far as they are concerned, final ; 
for at last they have found the trail towards eco- 
nomic freedom and they begin to see a future which 
holds out the promise of a most happy environment, 
one in which they as human beings may find at last 
a genuine opportunity for true self-expression. 
Sooner or later, to the fullest extent possible, the 
premium for all activities in these government indus- 
tries will be placed -upon the individual and collec- 
tive resourcefulness of the workers. There are no 
prior liens in the form of interest, profits, and rents. 
They feel either consciously or unconsciously that 
they are not serving in an exploiting enterprise, and 
that in the end, when all who are engaged therein 
have been completely won away from the heritages 
of the old system for conducting industry, the indi- 
vidual and united efforts of all the employees, both 
managers and workers, will achieve results far sur- 
passing anything permanently possible under other 
circumstances. 

That the earnestness and comprehension of these 
workers towards the ideals herein set forth are not 
in the least exaggerated is attested by the follow- 
ing taken from their recently published statement 
to the Secretary of War concerning the entire sub- 
ject: 

It has been gratifying to us to note, many times, that 
the necessity on the part of the men for economical pro- 
duction is well understood. For instance, at Watervliet 
Arsenal recently during the noon-day rallies which were 
being held the appeals of the speakers who were from 
the workers, were for efficiency. At Watertown some 
of the men stated that, in the interest of the workers their 
abilities were limited when it came to functioning on 
employees' committees, handling grievances, etc. ; for they 
said that that was not their forte. They did not feel able 
to confront the management in sufficiently forceful ways 
while prosecuting cases of such a nature. But they said 
they clearly saw their opportunity in the chances which 
now existed for functioning on production committees. 
Their abilities, they felt, lay in that direction and they 
most enthusiastically welcomed the circumstances which 
promised them these new opportunities for self expression. 
At Frankford and Rock Island instances have occurred 
where the employees have " gotten after " individuals 
who have not been doing as well as they might. A strik- 
ing incidence of the splendid spirit of cooperation which 
automatically develops when the employees are given an 
incentive and a chance for self expression, recently oc- 
curred at the Frankford Arsenal. The Office Department 
was in the market for a large order for dials for regis- 
tered mail locks, for which they had previously paid 
$45.00 per thousand. Frankford Arsenal submitted an 
estimate for $38.00 per thousand, so when the Committee 
on Estimates informed the employees that they had figured 
very closely in order that this work could be secured for 
them, the employees were very eager to express their ap- 
preciation of this new condition and volunteered to work 



during lunch hour if necessary to live up to their Commit- 
tee's judgment as to the direct costs. 

And further: 

It is our conviction, more now than ever before, that 
before long the opportunity will be ripe for us to secure 
outside talent in the form of competent management en- 
gineers and production experts to advise us as workers 
what we can do to help improve things, what the man- 
agement can do, and finally what we and the management 
can do jointly. We are not unaware of our limitations 
in this respect, and, when the time comes, we hope 
sincerely that you and the Chief of Ordnance will gladly 
extend to us the opportunity to have our technical ex- 
perts cooperate with the Arsenal management and their 
experts for the purpose of doing everything possible to 
warrant the fullest utilization of the arsenals as centers 
of production. The time will be ripe for this as soon as 
the basic spirit of cooperation and mutual confidence all 
through the arsenal organizations has been created. 

Such candid recognition of their responsibility as 
well as their present-day limitations, together with 
their anxiety for making good in every respect con- 
ceivable to them, can come only from a group in 
society that has not had its ideals distorted by class 
privilege, and that, in consequence, is quick to re- 
spond to the best that human beings are capable of 
service to their fellows. 

Perhaps above all else it is gratifying to note in 
this initial step towards true industrial democracy 
that the collective appeal for improved production 
'does not seem to be on a basis of a share in profits 
or bonuses or indeed anything which smatters of 
capitalistic ideals. The simple desire for the perma- 
nency of their positions is the motive which is actu- 
ating these workers. Upon this foundation, as 
swiftly as is consistent with genuine progress, they 
intend to build a temple of true emancipation from 
present-day industrial slavery. 

And the manner in which they are going about 
this is exactly as it should be. The temple is being 
built firmly and naturally. The conditions under 
which these employees have been working, measured 
by the standard of industry today, are relatively far 
advanced. The arsenals located as they are along 
beautiful rivers, in the hearts of thriving cities, or 
in delightful country districts, their buildings placed 
in well-kept parks with shady lawns and pathways, 
with the picturesque homes of many of the employees 
nearby certainly do not present the pictures pre- 
sented by the great majority of our factories 
depressing, unwholesome piles with their miserably 
squalid associations and surroundings. The workers 
enjoy a forty-four hour week, a yearly leave of 
absence of thirty days with pay, injury compensa- 
tion, medical attention, local cooperative enterprises, 
and other things commonly considered advantages. 
The standards of employment are well defined and 
understood, thanks to the Civil Service. It is but 



1919 



THE DIAL 



233 



natural therefore that these workers, employed in an 
atmosphere in which strife and contention do not 
exist, should turn their minds and activities into 
channels of constructive enterprise. 

How healthy this development has been is revealed 
by the nature of its growth. The workers, while 
contending for maximum utilization of these plants, 
insisted that this maximum utilization (in which the 
public as a whole is deeply concerned, for the 
arsenals have been provided out of public funds) 
be achieved only when it is guaranteed that they 
shall participate to the fullest extent possible, indi- 
vidually and collectively, in the functioning of their 
institutions. They propose to demonstrate to every- 
one's satisfaction their fitness so to participate and 
function, and they propose to assume responsibility 
only as fast as it is proven that they can success- 
fully control it. Certainly no exception can be taken 
to a program as constructive and well defined as this. 

The War Department's opening up of these 
manufacturing arsenals to industrial democracy will 
certainly be watched with intense interest. And 
both because they are engaged in an industrial field 
not circumscribed by the limitations and encumbered 



with the obstacles of private enterprise, and because 
it is the pioneer experiment in this country in true 
industrial democracy, we have here, in view of the 
growing articulateness of labor, a most important 
phenomenon in process of development. So far there 
seems to be no question about the good results se- 
cured. The measure of success which has followed 
is undoubtedly due to the wise policy which has 
permitted the introduction of democracy in these 
arsenals to proceed spontaneously and normally from 
the workers. In this way, and only in this way, 
can progress become true, wholesome, and thorough. 
Will the lessons which this experiment teaches be 
heeded by the Post Office Department, the Navy 
Department, and the Railroad Administration ? Will 
Congress and the President see its true significance 
with respect to the serious problems now confront- 
ing the country in connection with the final disposi- 
tion of the steam railways, the government-con- 
trolled ship yards? Will the public as a result 
comprehend and develop confidence in the programs 
for the democratization of our key industries as 
proposed and urged by labor? 



Civilization and Culture 



AT WOULD BE IDLE to praise or blame any fun- 
damental condition of our civilization, say its pre- 
vailingly industrial basis, to praise or blame any 
strand in the warp and woof of its genius. These 
conditions and these strands must be accepted as 
basic. They are slowly modifiable, of course, like 
everything else in the history of man, but radical 
modification of fundamentals does not seem neces- 
sary for the production of a genuine culture, how- 
ever much readjustment of their relations may be. 
In other words, a " genuine " culture is perfectly 
conceivable in any type or stage of civilization and 
in the mold of any national genius. It can be con- 
ceived as easily in terms of a Mohammedan poly- 
gamous society or of an American Indian " prim- 
itive " non-agricultural society as in those of our 
familiar Occidental societies. On the other hand, 
what may by contrast be called " spurious " cultures 
are just as easily conceivable in conditions of general 
advanced enlightenment as in those of relative 
ignorance and squalor. 

The " genuine " culture is not of necessity either 
" high " or " low " ; it is merely inherently har- 
monious, balanced, self-satisfactory. It is the expres- 
sion of a richly varied and yet somehow unified and 
consistent attitude towards life, an attitude that sees 



the significance of any one element of civilization in 
relation to all others. It is, ideally speaking, a cul- 
ture in which nothing is spiritually meaningless, in 
which no important part of the general functioning 
brings with it a sense of frustration, of misdirected, 
or, better, unsympathetic effort. It is not a spiritual 
hybrid of contradictory patches, of water-tight com- 
partments of consciousness thatrcarefully avoid par- 
ticipation in a harmonious synthesis. If the culture 
necessitates slavery, it frankly admits it ; if it abhors 
slavery, it feels its way to an economic adjust- 
ment that obviates the necessity for slavery. It 
does not make a great show in its ethical ideals of 
an uncompromising opposition to slavery, only sur- 
reptitiously to introduce what amounts to a slave 
system into certain portions- of its industrial mechan- 
ism. Or, if it builds itself magnificent houses of 
worship, it is because of the necessity it feels to 
symbolize in beautiful stone a religious impulse that 
is deep and vital; if it is ready to discard institu- 
tionalized religion, it is prepared also to dispense 
with the homes of institutionalized religion. It 
does not look sheepish when a direct appeal is made 
to its religious consciousness and then make amends 
by furtively donating a few dollars towards the 
maintenance of an African mission. Nor does it 



234

carefully instruct its children in what it knows to 
be of no use nor vitality either to them or in its own 
mature life. Nor does it tolerate a thousand other 
spiritual maladjustments such as are potent enough 
in our American life of today to those who care to 
see. It would be too much to say that even the 
purest examples of a genuine culture that the world 
has known have been free of spiritual discords, of 
the dry rot of -social habit, devitalized. But the 
great cultures, those that we instinctively feel to 
have been healthy spiritual organisms, such as the 
Athenian culture of the Age of Pericles and, to a 
less extent, the English culture of Elizabethan days, 
have at least tended to such harmony. 

It should be clearly understood that this ideal of a 
genuine culture has no necessary connection with 
what we are pleased to call efficiency. A society 
may be admirably efficient in the sense that all its 
activities are carefully planned with reference to 
ends of maximum utility to the society as a whole, 
it may tolerate no lost motion, yet it may well be a 
very inferior organism indeed as a culture-bearer. 
It is not enough that the ends of activities be socially 
satisfactory, that each member of the community feel 
in some dim way that he is doing his bit towards 
the attainment of a social benefit. This is all very 
well as far as it goes, but a genuine culture refuses 
to consider the individual as a mere cog in a wheel, 
as an entity whose sole raison d'etre lies in his sub- 
servience to a collective purpose that he is not con- 
scious of or that has only a remote relevancy' to his 
interests and strivings. The major activities of the 
individual must directly satisfy his own creative and 
emotional impulses, must always be something more 
than means to an end. The great cultural fallacy 
of industrialism, as developed up to the present time, 
is that in harnessing machines to our uses it has not 
known how to avoid the harnessing of the majority 
of mankind to its machines. The telephone girl 
who, for economic reasons, lends her capacities, dur- 
ing the greater part of the living day, to the manipu- 
lation of a technical routine that has an eventually 
high efficiency value but that answers to no spiritual 
needs of her own is really an appalling sacrifice to 
civilization. As a solution of the problem of culture 
she is necessarily a dismal failure the more dismal 
the greater her natural endowment. As with the 
telephone girl, so, it is to be feared, with the great 
majority of us, slave-stokers to fires that burn for 
demons that we would destroy, were it not that 
they appear in the guise of our highest benefactors. 
The American Indian that solves the economic prob- 
lem with salmon-spear and rabbit-snare is, if you 
like, operating on a relatively low level of civiliza- 
tion, but he represents to my mind an incomparably 
higher solution than our telephone girl, or, indeed, 



than most of us, of the questions that culture has to 
ask of economics. There is here no question pri- 
marily of immediate utility, of the effective directness 
of economic effort, nor of any sentimentalizing re- 
grets as to the passing of the " natural man." The 
Indian's salmon-spearing is a culturally higher type 
of activity than that of the telephone girl or mill 
hand simply because there is normally no sense of 
spiritual frustration during its prosecution, no feel- 
ing of subservience to tyrannous yet largely inchoate 
demands, further because it works in naturally and 
smoothly with all the rest of the Indian's activities 
instead of standing out as a desert patch of merely 
economic effort in the whole of life. 

We have already seen that there is no necessary 
correlation between the development of civilization 
and the relative genuineness of the culture which 
forms its spiritual essence. This requires a word of 
further explanation. By the development of civiliza- 
tion is here meant the ever increasing degree of 
sophistication of our society and of our individual 
lives. This progressive sophistication is the inevi- 
table cumulative result of the sifting processes of 
social experience, of the ever increasing complications 
of our innumerable types of organization, most of all 
of our steadily growing knowledge of our natural 
environment and, as a consequence, our practical 
mastery, for economic ends, of the resources that 
nature at once grants us and hides from us. It is 
chiefly the cumulative force of this sophistication 
that gives us the sense of what we call " progress." 
Perched on the heights of an office building twenty 
or more stories taller than our fathers ever dreamed 
of, we feel that we are getting up in the world. 
Hurling our bodies through space with an ever 
accelerating velocity, we feel that we are getting 
on in the world. Under sophistication I include not 
merely intellectual and technical advance, but most 
of the tendencies that make for a cleaner and 
healthier and, to a large extent, more humanitarian 
existence. Our growing sophistication, our ever 
increasing solicitude to obey the dictates of common 
sense, make these tendencies imperative. It would 
be sheer obscurantism to wish to stay their progress. 
But there can be no stranger illusion and it is an 
illusion we nearly all suffer from that because the 
tools of life are today more specialized and refined 
than ever before, it necessarily follows that we are 
iri like degrees attaining to a profounder harmony of 
life, to a deeper and more satisfying culture. It is 
as though we believed that an elaborate mathemati- 
cal computation that involved figures of seven and 
eight digits could not but result in a like figure. 
Yet we know that 1,000,000 multiplied by zero 
gives us zero quite as effectively as one multiplied 
by zero. The truth is that sophistication, which is 



1919 



THE DIAL 



2 35 



what we ordinarily mean by the progress of civiliza- 
tion, is, in the long run, a merely quantitative con- 
cept that defines the external conditions for the 
growth or decay of culture. We are right to have 
faith in the progress of civilization. We are wrong 
to assume that the maintenance or even advance of 
culture is a function of such progress. A reading 
of the facts of ethnology and culture history proves 
plainly that maxima of culture have been frequently 
reached in low levels of sophistication, very sorry 
minima in some of the highest. Civilization, as a 
whole, moves on; culture comes and goes. 

Every profound change in the flow of civilization, 
particularly in its economic bases, tends to bring 
about an unsettling and readjustment of culture 
values. Old culture forms, habitual types of re- 
action, tend to persist through the forces of inertia. 
The maladjustment of these habitual reactions to 
their new civilizational environment brings with it a 
measure, sometimes acute, of spiritual disharmony, 
which the more sensitive individuals feel eventually 
as a fundamental lack of culture. Sometimes the 
maladjustment corrects itself with great rapidity, at 
other times it may persist for generations, as in the 
case of America, where a chronic state of cultural 
maladjustment has for so long a period reduced much 
of our higher life to sterile externality. It is easier, 
generally speaking, for a genuine culture to subsist 
on a lower level of civilization: the differentiation 
of individuals as regards their social and economic 
functions is so much less than in higher levels that 
there is far less danger of the reduction of the indi- 
vidual to an unintelligible splinter of the social 
trunk. How to reap the undeniable benefits of 
great differentiation of functions without at the 
same time losing sight of the individual as a nucleus 
of live cultural values is the great and difficult prob- 
lem of any rapidly complicating civilization. We 
are far from having solved it in America. Indeed, 
it may be doubted whether more than an insignifi- 
cant minority are aware of the very existence of the 
problem. Yet the present world-wide labor unrest 
has as one of its deepest roots some sort of dim per- 
ception of the cultural fallacy of the present form 
of industrialism. For this reason it should be wel- 
comed. A civilization that has attained . to such 
ethical consciousness as we now possess and yet is, 
for the most part, based on helotry is hardly worth 
saving. 

It is perhaps the sensitive ethnologist who has 
studied an aboriginal civilization at first hand that 
is most impressed by the frequent vitality of culture 
in less sophisticated levels. He cannot but admire 
the well-rounded life of the average participant in, 
let us say, the civilization of a typical American 
Indian tribe ; the firmness with which every part of 



that life economic, social, religious, and esthetic 
is bound together into a significant whole in respect 
to which he is far from a passive pawn; above all, 
the molding, oftentimes definitely creative, role that 
he plays in the mechanism of his culture. When 
the political integrity of his tribe is destroyed by 
contact with the whites, and the old cultural values 
cease to have the atmosphere needed for their con- 
tinued vitality, the Indian is apt to find himself in 
a state of bewildered vacuity. Even if, as not in- 
frequently happens, he succeeds in making a fairly 
satisfactory compromise with his new environment, 
in making what his well-meaning patronizers con- 
sider great progress towards enlightenment, towards 
civilization, he is apt to retain an uneasy sense of 
the loss of some great but ill-defined good, some 
state of mind which he would be hard put to it to 
define but which gave him a courage and joy that 
latter-day prosperity never quite seems to have re- 
gained for him. What has happened is that he has 
slipped out of the warm embrace of a culture into 
the cold air of a fragmentary existence. What is 
sad about the passing of the Indian is not the deple- 
tion of his numbers by disease nor even the contempt 
that is too often meted out to him in his life on the 
reservation ; it is the fading away of a series of cul- 
tures, built out of the materials of a low order of 
sophistication, but genuine. 

We have no right to demand of the higher levels 
of sophistication that they preserve to the individual 
his manifold functioning, but we may well ask 
whether, as a surrogate, the individual may not 
reasonably demand an intensification in cultural 
value, a spiritual heightening, of such functions as 
are left him. Failing this, he must be frankly ad- 
mitted to have, in a cultural sense, not progressed but 
retrograded. The limitation in functioning works 
chiefly in the economic sphere. It is therefore im- 
perative, if the individual is to preserve his value as 
a cultured being, that he recoup himself out of the 
non-economic, the non-utilitarian spheres social, 
religious, scientific, esthetic. This idea of compensa- 
tion brings to view an important issue, that of the 
immediate and the remoter ends of human effort. 

As a mere organism, man's only function is to 
exist; in other words, to keep himself alive and to 
propagate his kind. Hence the procuring of food, 
clothing, and shelter for himself and those dependent 
on him constitutes the immediate end of his effort. 
There are civilizations, like that of the Eskimo, in 
which by far the greater part of man's energy is 
consumed in the satisfaction of these immediate 
ends. There are practically no civilizations, 
however, in which at least some of the available 
energy is not set free for the remoter ends, though, 
as a rule, these remoter ends are by a process of 



236 



THE DIAL

rationalization made to seem to contribute to the 
immediate ones. (A magical ritual, for instance, 
which, psychologically considered, seems to liberate 
and give form to powerful emotional and esthetic 
elements of our nature, is nearly always put in har- 
ness to some humdrum utilitarian end the catching 
of rabbits or the curing of chicken pox.) As a 
matter of fact, there are very few of even the 
" primitive " civilizations that do not consume an 
exceedingly large share of their energies in the pur- 
suit of the remoter ends, though it remains true that 
these remoter ends are nearly always functionally or 
pseudo-functionally interwoven with the immediate 
ends. Art for art's sake may be a psychological fact 
on these less sophisticated levels; it is certainly not 
a cultural fact. 

On our own level of civilization the remoter ends 
tend to split off altogether from the immediate ones 
and to assume the form of a spiritual escape or refuge 
from the pursuit of the latter. The separation of 
the two classes of ends is never absolute nor can it 
ever be; it is enough to note the presence of a 
powerful drift of the two away from each other. 
It is easy to demonstrate this drift by examples 
taken out of our daily experience. Thus, while 
in most primitive civilizations the dance is apt 
to be a ritual activity at least ostensibly associ- 
ated with purposes of an economic nature, it is 
with us a merely and self-consciously pleasurable 
activity that not only splits off from the sphere of 
the pursuit of immediate ends but even tends to 
assume a position of hostility to that sphere. In a 
primitive civilization a great chief dances as a mat- 
ter of course, oftentimes as a matter of exercising 
a peculiarly honored privilege. With us the captain 
of industry either refuses to dance at all or does so 
as a half-contemptuous concession to the vagaries of 
social custom. On the other hand, the artist of a 
Ballet Russe has sublimated the dance to an exquisite 
instrument of self-expression, has succeeded in pro- 
viding himself with an adequate or even more than 
adequate cultural recompense for his loss of mastery 
in the realm of direct ends. The captain of indus- 
try is one of the comparatively small class of indi- 
viduals that has inherited, in vastly complicated 
form, something of the feeling of control over the 
attainment of direct ends that belongs by cultural 
right to primitive man; the ballet dancer has saved 
and intensified for himself the feeling of spontaneous 
participation and creativeness in the world of indi- 
rect ends that also belong by cultural right to prim- 
itive man. Each has saved part of the wreckage of 
a submerged culture for himself. 

The psychology of direct and indirect ends under- 
goes a gradual modification, only partly consum- 
mated as yet, in the higher levels of civilization. 



The immediate ends continue to exercise the same 
tyrannical sway in the ordering of our lives, but as 
our spiritual selves become enriched and develop 
a more and more inordinate craving for subtler 
forms of experience, there develops also an attitude 
of impatience with the solution of the more imme- 
diate problems of life. In other words, the imme- 
diate ends cease to be felt as chief ends and gradually 
become necessary means, but only means, towards 
the attainment of the more remote ends. These 
remoter ends, in turn, so far from being looked 
upon as purely incidental activities that result from 
the spilling over of an energy concentrated almost 
entirely on the pursuit of the immediate ends, be- 
come the chief ends of life. This change of attitude 
is implied in the statement that the art, science, re- 
ligion of a higher civilization best express its "spirit" 
or culture. The transformation of ends thus briefly 
outlined is far from an accomplished fact; it is 
rather an obscure drift in the history of values, an 
expression of the volition of the more sensitive par- 
ticipants in our culture. Certain temperaments feel 
themselves impelled far along the drift, others lag 
behind. The captains of. industry are the virtuosos 
among the laggards. 

The transformation of ends is of the greatest cul- 
tural importance, because it acts as a powerful force 
for the preservation of culture in levels in which a 
fragmentary economic functioning of the individual 
is inevitable. So long as the individual retains a 
sense of control over the major goods of life he is 
able to take his place in the cultural patrimony of 
his people. Now that the major goods of life have 
shifted so largely from the realm of immediate to 
that of remote ends, it becomes a cultural necessity 
for all who would not be looked upon as disinherited 
to share in the pursuit of these remoter ends. No 
harmony and depth of life, no culture, is possible 
when activity is well-nigh circumscribed by the 
sphere of immediate ends and when functioning 
within that sphere is so ^fragmentary as to have no 
inherent intelligibility or interest. Right here is 
the grimmest joke of our present American civiliza- 
tion. The vast majority of us, deprived of any but 
an insignificant and culturally abortive share in the 
satisfaction of the immediate wants of mankind, are 
further deprived of both opportunity and stimula- 
tion to share in the production of non-utilitarian 
values. Part of the time we are dray-horses; the 
rest of the time, if such time is vouchsafed us, we 
are listless consumers of goods that have received 
no least impress of our own personality. In other 
words, our spiritual selves go hungry, for the most 
part, pretty much all of the time.

The Responsibility for Leadership 



UST NOW A MAN from Alabama was saying to me : 
After this America will lead the world. We have 
turned the scales in the war. We have raised 
money. We have made an army. We have built ships. 
We have gone after the world's commerce. We 
have given other countries great ideas. The world 
looks to us, and we are going to come through." At 
this a Kansan became eloquent on the " mission " of 
the United States: "We are going to show these 
peoples how they ought to govern themselves. We'll 
step in and start them right if they don't seem to 
get the idea. We'll send some of our boys into Rus- 
sia, or Austria, or Mexico, if necessary, for it's up 
to us to see that the mess these people have made 
for themselves is straightened out." Something of 
this sort, in endless variety, crops up today in every- 
body's mind. The world looks to America, and we 
are conscious of it; a cataclysm has awakened us to 
the existence of the rest of the world, and, in the 
enthusiasm of our discovery, we should like to set 
everything right through the exercise of American 
leadership. 

Actually, there is one great obstacle to such a 
program, and that is our own ignorance. We are 
one and all eager to see the prestige which the 
United States possesses at this moment extended 
into the future, but we do not stop to consider what 
this involves. No small proportion of the Amer- 
ican people believes today that we should " go into " 
Mexico with some millions of soldiers and " estab- 
lish order." The average man's conception of lead- 
ership is personal domination, and ordering others 
around. It requires a distinct effort on his part to 
realize that the principle of " self-deterYnination," 
of growth through the exercise of individual re- 
sponsibility, must apply equally to persons and polit- 
ical groups. It requires a still greater effort for 
him to understand that the only leadership which 
can possibly promote human advancement is a lead- 
ership in knowledge and ideas. Leadership based 
upon force and physical power cannot permanently 
be maintained; leadership in knowledge cannot be 
overthrown through the vicissitudes of battle. 
Greece, conquered, led captive imperial Rome. If, 
then, we would exercise leadership in the world, 
this must be intellectual leadership ; if we would 
play a leading role in shaping the destinies of other 
human aggregations, we must accept the obligation 
of preparing ourselves for the part we express our 
willingness to play. 

The kind of preparedness, then, which American 
leadership in the world demands is knowledge. If 
we are to enter into relations with other peoples 



Lithuanians, Ruthenians, Ukrainians, Vlachs, Slov- 
enes, Albanians we must know everything pos- 
sible about them, about the conditions under 
which they live, and about the countries which 
they inhabit. If we are to lend a hand in re- 
making the world for them, we must understand 
their ambitions, their customs, and their ideas. 
If we are to advise them, and to pass judg- 
ment upon their efforts towards democracy, we 
must know how they have been governed. It 
is not a simple matter to find out how men are 
governed or govern themselves. How do we govern 
ourselves? " By the Constitution," you may say. 
Well, Latin-American republics have taken over 
our constitution without getting a government like 
ours. There is more in any government than ap- 
pears in its formal documents ; to comprehend it you 
must endeavor to grasp the spirit in which the gov- 
ernment is carried on. 

To be effective, leadership must be based on 
knowledge. If we as a people are to play a suc- 
cessful part in the new world of the future, we must 
be prepared, we must have knowledge. And this 
knowledge, this preparedness, must be individual. 
There is no country, no nation, apart from the 
actual living men and women of which it is com- 
posed. There is no knowledge in a country except 
what has been acquired by individuals. The re- 
sponsibility of our country is a responsibility which 
must be accepted by each separate person within it. 
We believe in democracy, but do we take it to 
heart that the very essence of democracy consists in 
the power of the average man to decide great ques- 
tions by his vote? Think of it. You accept Presi- 
dent Wilson as one of the greatest of men; you

have been inspired with the idea of America democ- 
racy is on trial, and it will fail if the individual 
citizen shirks his responsibility. 

That the citizen may know, knowledge must be 
available. At the present moment, knowledge is 
not available in this country to anything like the 
same extent that it is in Germany. We have been

fighting Germany with German books. The Journal 
of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, last Sep- 
tember, pointed out that, as a war measure, we must 
reprint here, and in German, Beilstein's handbook 
of organic chemistry! In Germany knowledge in 
every field is made available in the form of syste- 
matic handbooks which contain the results of all 
the special researches of scholars throughout the 
world. Here we have no such highly developed aids 
to leadership. 

Confronted with a certain superiority in learning 
on the part of the Germans, we have taken, since 
the war; altogether too much comfort from the idea 
that Germans are not original, that the epoch- 
making discoveries in science have all come from 
Allied countries. Granted that Germany has been 
deficient in genius of the highest order, let us grasp 
the fact that, once started, the new lines of work 
(like the dye industry) have owed their orderly and 
systematic development to the German capacity for 
taking pains. Before we condemn the Germans for 
appropriating other men's ideas, for being mere hack- 
workers in science and scholarship, let iis remember 
that they have made the world their debtor for the 
systematic presentation of available knowledge. The 
fact is that, for the German who desires to know, 
knowledge is available in his own language to an 
extent undreamed of in other countries, and the 
special sources from which our university teachers 
draw are the common wells accessible to all the 
German people. 

The American man, occupied in making his own 
contribution to the common welfare, cannot leave 
manufacturing or selling to organize special fields of 
learning. But the community -maintains a body of 
men whose everyday work is the systematization of 
knowledge, and the community has a right to expect 
the university professor to make knowledge avail- 
able in any form required by the American people. 
That this has not been done already is to be ex- 
plained by the fact that the work of universities is 
not developed in immediate contact with life; the 
subjects of instruction, like the college campus, are 
ordinarily remote from the stress of active existence. 
The time has come, however, when our institutions 
of higher learning must reconsider the nature of the 
service they are rendering to the people who main- 
tain them. 

Up to the present, colleges have limited their 
efforts to the instruction of " college students." The 
instruction offered has been stereotyped and formal ; 
the subjects taught have been the crystallized prod- 
ucts of an outworn tradition. Meanwhile, the men 
and women for whom this lifeless instruction is pro- 
vided, have discovered for themselves that the value 
of their four years lies, not in what the professor 



offers, but in the associations with other students 
which they establish for the future. " Graduation," 
the completion of a course, is regarded not as a 
sign of proficiency in learning but as a necessity 
for establishing an unquestioned identity with the 
group. 

In contrast with this old regime, the point of 
view we must grasp is that the university is the only 
agency we have in our democracy for the enlarge- 
ment and dissemination of knowledge. In the 
United States we have no leisure class which culti- 
vates learning as its object in life. Our leisure class 
consists mainly of women over forty, and they have 
not yet begun to devote themselves to scholarship. 
It is true that university authorities have laid great 
stress upon " original research " and " productive 
scholarship." It is true that investigation has been 
held up as the highest aim of the professor's career, 
and that presidents, in annual reports, have printed 
unnumbered and forgotten lists of the " original 
contributions " of college faculties. All this is a 
recognition of the fact that the search for new 
knowledge is essential both for the individual and 
the world, and the idea that this search should be 
emphasized in universities, though introduced from 
Germany, is radically sound. With us, however, 
the results obtained have been undistinguished and 
often trivial, for here " publication " has been set 
up as the road to promotion and higher pay, and 
on this account exaggerated weight has been laid 
upon productions essentially unimportant and im- 
mature. The trouble is that all judgments in regard 
to university work have been based upon the narrow 
criteria of university life, and without thought to the 
larger public which the university is called upon to 
serve. 

In the new world before us the function of the 
university can no longer be confined to the instruc- 
tion of a limited body of students. The future of 
democracy requires that the university should assume 
the obligation for the intellectual leadership of the 
country at large. The university teacher is occu- 
pied in systematizing knowledge for presentation to 
college classes, he must now undertake to systema- 
tize it for the use of men and women in the open 
world. This democracy of ours requires that the 
means of knowledge must be at the disposition of 
all the people, and American leadership turns upon 
the ability of the American professor to emerge 
from his seclusion to discover the intellectual needs 
of his fellows, and to provide for them. 

But the service which the university professor is 
called upon to render in the interests of American 
leadership does not end here. The war has shown 
that the world .is ruled by ideas. Ideas, it has been 
discovered, are instruments by which men arc

moved, by which upheavals are accomplished. Fol- 
lowing Germany, every country has, in the course 
of the last four years, set up a ministry of propa- 
ganda. The German means for influencing ideas 
have, however, been carried far beyond the distri- 
bution of obviously one-sided literature and the sub- 
sidizing of newspapers. In the field of science and 
scholarship, at least, Germany's intellectual propa- 
ganda has been based upon the conception of 
rendering vital and necessary service to the world. 
The German has understood, as few others, the 
importance of making himself indispensable. So he 
has created a vast apparatus of scholarship, a set of 
tools for intellectual workers, upon which students 
everywhere are forced to rely. As a result the 
American scholar and scientist is dependent upon 
German organization of knowledge, and is inevit- 
ably led to accept German orientation of his scien- 
tific ideas. We are thus faced by the strange situa- 
tion that, whereas the. effectiveness of American, 
industry and the alertness of American soldiers have 
triumphed over German military power, American 
scholarship and teaching continue to be dominated 
by German system and ideas. There can be but 
one response to this condition of affairs: American 
thought and scientific interest must be freed from 
German intellectual tradition, and set upon the way 



of its own intellectual growth. Concretely, this 
means that we who have hitherto been inconspicuous 
in the world of scholarship must contest an ac- 
knowledged German leadership in every field of 
scientific endeavor. In a very real sense, therefore, 
the prestige of America is now in the hands of its 
university men. 

The events of the last four years have opened the 
eyes of men to immeasurable possibilities. An old 
world has passed away, the new one to follow has 
not yet taken form. We face one of those great 
opportunities in the world's history when all things 
seem possible, when advances of bewildering magni- 
tude seem assured, when man appears for a golden 
moment in a creative role. Very shortly the heavy 
hand of the accustomed will have once more fixed 
our ways, and the world will have become crystal- 
lized for another epoch. At this moment the oppor- 
tunity exists for an American leadership of the 
world, if we may grasp it. There can, however, 
be no such leadership without an independent and 
effective intellectual life. Without this we might 
exercise the power of Rome, and still remain under 
the tutelage of some modern Greece. Is it necessary 
to ask the question? Is Germany, defeated, to be 
our Greece?

The Scholar Too Late 



IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR with the erudite and unin- 
teresting in literature you will know that Professor 
Maurice has no rival as an authority in Restoration 
drama. The knowledge of this may prejudice you 
against him unduly. I know of no other lecturer 
so perennially, though perhaps also none more 
ephemerally entertaining. He is hardly more than 
forty-five spare, erect, and gravely boyish. His 
bearing in the lecture room is instinct with grace 
and courtesy. He speaks with a flashing, pointed 
ease, each sentence like a stiletto stroke in the sun- 
light. As in the days when we made a cult .of him 
he holds his crowded classes with whimsical spells, 
deft of voice and word. He has refined on the 
methods I remember. There was a time when he 
was slightly melodramatic; when he was not above 
affecting a barely perceptible quaver in the voice 
over pathetic passages, when the oratorical pause was 
in daily requisition after periods delicately evolved. 
But he has shed crudities with his youth, and cap- 
tures the willing ear with the more subtle charms 
of a rich careful cadence. He is more nearly himself 
before his audience, and his self is calculatingly at- 
tractive. The strength of his appeal seems to have 
been dependent mainly on the sparkling quality of 



his mind. The sparkle remains, but behind it there 
is a perceptible and quite real shadow. His swift 
easy gestures and cultured merriment over the things 
of literary yesterdays have the tragic meaning of a 
gay harlequin before a tall sable curtain. The cur- 
tain is a perspective of saddened years. He plays for 
this effect, of course, but it is not all mere excellent 
acting. He sees himself as a potential hero defeated 
by relentless destiny. It is strange that the maidens 
who throng to hear him never guess themselves the 
figurative mill-stone about his neck, never apply per- 
sonally the resentment and discontent with his lot 
so implicit under his charming surface in this later 
style and mood. He loathes lecturing. He loathes 
theses and philology. These things he tolerates, he 
will tell you in private with open bitterness, to 
make a living. What he would really like would be 
to write great poetry and great plays. I think he 
knows now in a subconscious fashion that he could 
never have done these things had he had infinite 
leisure. But he must excuse himself somehow. He 
puts the odium on a life of drudgery, and mourns io 
secret, meanwhile transmuting his unhappiness, in 
public, into an indispensable popularity. It is still 
the vogue for freshman girls to fall in love with

him. The flowing tie, the suave melancholy of a 
Hamlet efficiently banished these and a handsome 
face make him the great drawing card of the Eng- 
lish department. 

Ten years ago he had gathered about him a little 
band of university students who tried to write and 
who were for those days radicals. Eight or ten of 
us would sit about his fireplace once a month or so, 
smoking in Tennysonian attitudes into the night, 
and discussing Socialism or Fitzgerald's plays from 
the Spanish. Later we would draw out manuscripts 
in turn, reading them aloud in self-conscious voices, 
writhing under criticism as is the way of mortals. 
On rare occasions one of us would achieve publica- 
tion, thereafter sitting in flushed dignity to hear the 
envious plaudits of our fellows. Them we could 
discount in private, but Maurice's word was law to 
us in esthetics. It was his custom to wait until the 
others had spoken before he made his brief pointed 
comment always a bit malicious, always convin- 
cingly just. It made up a great part of our respect 
for him that he had published early and had three 
volumes of verse to his credit. Sometimes, not 
often, his work was printed in The Century or Scrib- 
ner's. Then he would expand a bit, and hint of 
marvelous things he hoped to do, opening vistas of 
otheR cities and great personages he had known. 
Perhaps we all distrusted his optimism somewhat, 
but we saw the literary world through him, and it 
was hard to judge. 

There were days following a flood of rejection 
slips when he would advert bitterly to his standing 
in^the University. Because he believed in literature, 
and not only in its dry bones, because he chose to 
write of his own times rather than for the, Journal 
of Modern Philology, other men were promoted 
over his head. He would say ruefully though with 
playfulness that it would pay any young idealistic 
instructor to put his scruples in his pocket and write 
a dull paper or two. Once, when asked to take a 
place on a philological program to fill a sudden 
vacancy, he evolved over night a novel and startling 
theory concerning the rhythms of Beowulf which 
made the doctors thoughtful. He chuckled over this 
feat, and brought the essay out for our delectation, 
treating the episode as a mad prank, a sort of prac- 
tical joke on the pundits. They had told him it was 
one of the best papers ever listed in their series. 
And he admitted that it probably was. He named 
over a fanciful list of subjects that had occurred to 
him for similar treatment Styles of Beards in 
.Chaucer, A Shadwell Concordance, The Use of 
Poisons in Webster's Dramas. " You think I'm 
joking," he said suddenly, turning on us, " but there 
isn't one of those ideas that wouldn't get across." 



In this same year he published two papers in the 
Modern Language Review on The Authenticity of 
Accepted Anglo-Saxon Word-Root Derivations. 
They were received with something as nearly ap- 
proaching acclaim as the academic world has ever 
shown. 

But all this was forgotten in the delirious unbe- 
lievable days that followed the acceptance of one 
of his earlier plays, The King Can Do No Wrong, 
by a Broadway producer. Here was not only great 
glory in the offing, but great wealth. Our excite 
ment brought us together oftener than usual, and 
we discussed gravely what we had heard of royalties. 
Maurice read the play to us, stopping often for com- 
ment or suggestion; words were changed, and deli- 
cate distinctions of phrase discussed. Even then 
and to our uninitiated circle the construction seemed 
a bit weak, though none of us had the courage to 
say so. And the dialogue in spots was unbelievably 
clever. The play ran an actual two weeks. In the 
blaze of this success our misgivings withered and 
our admiration flared up afresh. But the play seems 
to have rather baffled those who attended it. There 
was no very discoverable theme for one thing, and in 
place of plot an ingeniously piled shaky structure of 
dramatic tricks, capped with dazzling repartee. For 
a few days we exchanged press notices, but this soon 
became a gloomy business to be avoided. One critic 
referred to the play as reminiscent of the young 
Moliere. This was at once its greatest compliment 
and a fairly accurate estimate. 

Just how heavy a blow the failure was to him we 
never knew. I remember that he came very quietly 
into the room that evening, reading a manuscript in- 
tently, flushed, intoxicated with a new enthusiasm. 
It was an effective entrance whether planned or in- 
stinctive. We waited a moment before he looked 
up. He was quieter than usual, but incandescent. 
We chatted as was our custom, meanwhile conscious 
as himself of some glowing secret that transformed 
him. When the reading began he brought out three 
poems in free verse written in a seven-fold heat the 
afternoon before we came. He was confident he 
had struck a new vein. For some years he had at- 
tacked free verse with sharp irony. It was a sub- 
ject that gave scope to his brilliant invective. And 
now he had deserted with startling suddenness to 
the opposition. The poems, daring in subject and 
phrase, compact of accurate observation, were unde- 
niably good. They were published somewhere in 
series, and made something of a stir, though he seems 
never to have done so well again. Meanwhile his 
plans were magnificent enough, and we were caught 
up with his elation. He dropped the whole subject 
of dramatics without explanations and went over to 



1919

poetry, digging out his ancient files of manuscript, 
and planning a volume. We followed his lead un- 
questioningly, put away our one-act plays, and 
began to do lyrics once more. 

But when our group left the University he was 
slowly going over to the enemy. He had failed at 
the thing he believed in, living literature ; and he had 
made several magnificent successes without effort in 
philological criticism. In the intervening years he 
has faced squarely about. He has taken the little 
worked subject of Restoration drama as his province, 
and set his keen mind to clearing it of doubt. There 
can be no question that his work is exceptionally well 
done. There is in this country no scholar who can 
vie with him as an authority on Wycherley or Dry- 
den. His massive comparative analysis of the texts 
of All for Love and Antony and Cleopatra ranks 
with the work of the best European scholars. The 
intellect that worked so uncertainly at creative effort 
has functioned in research with uncanny surety and 
insight. The work of Furness is irritatingly muddy 
beside Maurice's crystal exposition. But he has not 



got the coveted full professorship. This is the sym- 
bol and the reality of his disappointment. When he 
gave himself up to the ideals of German scholarship 
the country was definitely for the first time turning 
from them. He has made himself at great pains 
master of an outworn technique. His concession 
was made too late. The gods have rejected his un- 
willing, tardy sacrifice. It is still as a lecturer to 
undergraduates that he holds his place and makes 
himself invaluable. To be sure he is the one man 
who cannot see clearly his own situation nor under- 
stand the inevitable forces that array themselves 
against his new-found, hard-won position. In the 
evenings, in all free hours, he works at a steadily 
growing and monumental masterpiece of old school 
commentary, his Restoration Dictionary, and in the 
mornings he faces as in his youth the flooding, wear- 
ing tides of uninformed humanity; with every year 
quieter, sadder, more subtly ironical idolized, hero- 
worshiped, and with no escape.

So, Master, the wine gave you something, 
I suppose. 

I think I see you, 

Your silks all disarranged, 

Lolling in a green-marble pavilion, 

Ogling the concubines of the Emperor's Court 

Who pass the door 

In yellow coats, and white jade ear-drops, 

Their hair pleated in folds like the hundred 

clouds. 
I watch you, 

Hiccoughing poetry between drinks, 
Sinking as the sun sinks, 
Sleeping for twenty-four hours, 
While they peek at you, 
Giggling, 
Through the open door. 

You found something in the wine, 

I imagine, 

Since you could not leave it, 

Even when, after years of wandering, 

You sat in the boat with one sail, 

Traveling down the zigzag rivers 

On your way back to Court. 

You had a dream, 

I conjecture. 

You saw something under the willow T -lights 

of the water 
Which swept you to dizziness, 



So that you toppled over the edge of the boat, 
And gasped, and became your dream. 

Twelve hundred years 

Or thereabouts. 

Did the wine do it? 

I would sit in the purple moonlight 

And drink three'hundred cups, 

If I believed it. 

Three hundred full cups, 

After your excellent fashion, 

While in front of me 

The river-dazzle ran before the moon, 

And the light flaws of the evening wind 

Scattered the notes of nightingales , 

Loosely among the kuai trees. 

They erected a temple to you: 
" Great Doctor, 
Prince of Poetry, / 

Immortal man who loved drink." 

I detest wine, 

And I have no desire for the temple, 

Which under the circumstances 

Is fortunate. 

But I would sacrifice even sobriety 

If, when I was thoroughly drunk, 

I could see what you saw 

Under the willow-clouded water, 

The day you died.

The Organization of Teachers in the United States 



LHE WORLD WAR has changed many of our old 
conceptions. We take for granted many things that 
would have been considered impossible five years ago. 
A strike of actors or policemen is accepted with a 
degree of equanimity that seems almost startling. 
Firemen and government employees are organizing 
and affiliating with organized labor as if it were 
quite the common thing. And most remarkable of 
all is the fact that even teachers are acquiring the 
knowledge of group-consciousness. 

Slow and painful has been the progress of the 
teacher toward a realization that his salvation lies 
in joining together with his fellows for the protec- 
tion of his economic status. And still more slowly 
has come the realization of the part he must play 
in the protection of the interests of the children and 
the schools against grasping politicians and vested 
interests anxious to maintain control of the schools 
to prevent " insidious" theories from finding their 
way through their sacred portals. 

With few exceptions, teachers are still grouped 
in associations, supposedly for cultural purposes and 
for the advancement of the profession. The basis 
of organization is generally the position of the 
teacher in the educational scheme of things. There 
are associations of kindergarten teachers, of elemen- 
tary, upper elementary, or high school teachers. Or 
the subject taught may form the basis, as for example 
associations of biology teachers, or history teachers, 
and so forth. The number of associations- in a 
single city is generally large. In New York City 
there are at present more than fifty. Above all these 
is the National Education Association, to which all 
teachers of whatefer grade are eligible. At its an- 
nual conventions, held at the beginning of the sum- 
mer vacation, all teachers are expected to flock to 
receive the message of the leaders of the teaching 
profession, of government, and business. Innumer- 
able speakers will dilate upon the glories of the 
teachers' mission, various " experts " will discuss the 
many phases of the teachers' work, and the much 
harrassed teacher will derive therefrom as much 
comfort as he can. 

The various teachers' associations have in common 
the complete divorce between the teacher and his 
economic problems, which the steady increase in the 
cost o'f living is tending to break down. The Na- 
tional Education Association has lately taken a very 
decided interest in the poor salaries paid to teachers. 
Teachers' associations are generally led by a prin- 
cipal or superintendent, to provide a dignified fore- 
ground for their activities. This arrangement also 



helps to discourage teachers from giving their atten- 
tion to anything more serious than organizing pic- 
nics or outings, or arranging courses of study for 
that " self-improvement " of the teachers, which 
really means obeying the principals' orders. In fair- 
ness it must be stated that until very lately teachers 
were quite satisfied with their inferior position, and 
objected very strongly to any effort to improve it." 
They accepted an arrangement whereby everything 
was determined for them, including salary, hours, 
and other conditions. They were satisfied to be 
rated every six months by their " superiors," to be 
bullied and scolded by their principals; to be told 
what to think, what to teach, and what to read, or 
not to read. As long as teachers' associations con- 
fined themselves to the consideration of such harm- 
less pastimes as the study of pedagogic methods and 
scrupulously abstained from critical discussion of 
social and economic problems, and as long as they 
maintained a superior aloofness from the everyday 
problems of the world about them, their associations 
were regarded with benevolent interest and approval 
when they were not entirely ignored. 

Such an attitude on the part of the authorities 
and the teachers could have but one result, namely 
to keep our schools in a state of complete stagna- 
ton. Everywhere we find that initiative was dis- 
couraged and even punished ; ideas were penalized ; 
slavish following of routine was rewarded. Through 
their power to " hire and fire " educational author- 
ities were able to prevent the growth of any serious 
opposition among the ranks of those who attempted 
to raise the status of the teacher. 

The utter failure of the school system to solve the 
problems confronting it has been so obvious that 
widespread demands in the last ten years have been 
made in many parts of the country for an investiga- 
tion. A series of surveys were instituted in a great 
number of cities, which produced excellent reports, 
but which resulted in very little practical benefit. 
Professor McMurray, of the Hanus Investigating 
Committee, came near to putting his finger on the 
sore spot, when he pointed out that one of the be- 
setting sins of the school system was the general 
lack of initiative among the teachers, and the results 
that follow from this condition. 

But it was the teachers of Chicago that first came 
to the realization that conditions needed improve- 
ment, and that this improvement must come through 
their united efforts and not through the benevolent 
acts of friendly officials. Nineteen years ago the 
maximum salary in Chicago was $825 a. year, or $16

a week, attained after eleven years of service. Exas- 
perated by the meanness and trickery of a city which 
pleaded that an empty treasury made an increase 
impossible, they determined to show the city where 
it could get the money. 

A quiet investigation quickly brought to light the 
fact that several large and powerful corporations had 
systematically evaded the payment of their taxes. In 
spite of the refusal of the city authorities to aid 
them, the teachers succeeded in forcing these delin- 
quent corporations to disgorge about $600,000 a 
year in taxes, after a vigorous legal battle. When 
the victory of the teachers was certain, the city 
calmly proceeded to raise the salaries not of the 
teachers but of the policemen. 

It was then that the teachers felt the need of a 
strong union; and upon the invitation of the Chi- 
cago Federation of Labor, then as now led by those 
militant leaders, Fitzpatrick and Olander, they de- 
termined to affiliate with organized labor in order to 
secure the support which they needed and which they 
could get from no other source. As a result of this 
aid, the maximum salaries have since been increased 
from $825 a year to $1,800. In addition to this, 
the teachers, through their affiliation with labor, 
have learned to understand labor's problems. They 
aided in the strikes of the pressmen and newsboys, 
the garment workers, and coal miners. They fought 
hard for woman suffrage. Ella Flagg Young had 
their untiring support in her fight to free the public 
schools from politicians and text-book companies. 
The efforts of the Illinois Manufacturers' Associa- 
tion to separate the" children of the workers from the 
children of the rich, by relegating the poor into the 
manual schools and reserving the academic schools 
for the rich, was quickly exposed by the teachers. 
They also fought for the use of the public schools 
as social centers. 

It was not until May 1914, that the teachers 
of Cleveland organized the second teachers' union. 
It had a very short life, however. The Superin- 
tendent of Schools regarded a union with great dis- 
favor and at once discharged six of the leaders, all 
of them excellent teachers of long experience. Al- 
though an injunction had been secured to prevent 
such action, the upper courts sustained the right of 
the Superintendent to discharge the union leaders. 
The next successful effort was made in New York. 
In March 1916, one thousand teachers organized 
the Teachers' Union of New York. Following this, 
within a few months, unions were organized in 
Gary, Ind. ; Scranton, Pa., and Washington, D. C. 
In May 1916, these unions together with the three 
in Chicago formally launched the American Federa- 



tion of Teachers, affiliated -with the American Fed- 
eration of Labor, and adopted the American Teacher 
as its official organ. 

The American Federation of Teachers, commonly 
known as the A. F. of T., was not formed merely 
for the protection of the economic interests of the 
teachers, important as that is. Its motto Democ- 
racy in Education: Education for Democracy best 
sums up what it stands for. It aims, in other words, 
to transform the present subordinate and subservient 
position which the teacher occupies into that of a 
sharer in the great work of education. It demands 
first of all permanency of tenure, based on meri- 
torious service, and not upon the whim of a School 
Board. It demands further that teachers be granted 
a direct share in the management of the school, in 
the formulation of courses of study, in the selection 
of principals, and in the determination of school 
policies. It demands representation for teachers on 
boards of education, and teachers' trial courts. That 
the teacher is at present sadly unprepared to assume 
such functions is readily admitted. Long years of 
serfdom havt tended to unfit the teacher to play the 
part which he should of right play. But just as the 
organized railroad workers are insisting that the 
only democratic solution of railroad problems is 
to entrust them to those who are best acquainted 
with the industry, so the A. F. of T. insists that the 
only way to maintain a democratic school system is 
to manage it democratically, and not autocratically 
as at present. It demands that teachers be entrusted 
with this power and responsibility not only because 
it would help to develop a new type of teacher, but 
also because it would bring to bear upon the prob- 
lems of the school all the teacher's varied experience. 
The work of teachers' unions has met with 
determined opposition on the part of school boards, 
who fear the growth of group-consciousness or 
group-power among teachers lest it threaten the ex- 
isting control of the schools, so satisfactory to the 
powers that be. The Chicago union in particular 
had aroused the unrelenting opposition of the pow- 
erful corporations. In June 1916, thirty-eight of 
the officers and active members of the Union were 
discharged, although all had been rated " excellent " 
or " very good." In spite of the fact that public 
opinion was on the side of the teacher, the corpora- 
tion-dominated Board of Education received the 
support of the Supreme Court of Illinois, which 
decided, on appeal, that the Board could discharge 
a teacher " because she is married, or unmarried ; 
is, or is not a member of a trades union, or whether 
no reason is given." A year -later a truce was 
patched up between the Board and the union, where- 
by the discharged teachers were reappointed on con-

dition that the Federation end its affiliation with 
Labor and be dissolved. 

The New York Union has been under constant 
attack since its very inception. Taking advantage 
of the war hysteria, the School Board, through 
vague charges of lukewarm loyalty, was able to dis- 
charge some of the active union teachers. The cli- 
max in this policy of union-baiting came in April 
1919, when, following a Free Speech meeting held 
by the Union, the Board prohibited the Union from 
holding any more meetings in the schools. It also 
decided to investigate the " life, loyalty and activi- 
ties " of every member of the Union. Its effort to 
carry out this inquisition was' balked by the re- 
fusal of the officers to answer any questions about 
their activities, because they mistrusted the proceed- 
ings, and because all the Central Labor Union 
bodies, representing a half million organized work- 
ers, rallied enthusiastically to the support of the 
teachers. That a new spirit had entered the teach- 
ing body is evident from the fact that over three 



hundred Union members signed a statement that 
if the officers were guilty, they were equally guilty; 
and that if the officers were to be punished, they 
must be punished also. Similar persecution of a 
teacher in Washington, D. C., resulted in so vig- 
orous a counter-attack upon the Board on the part 
of the organized teachers and workers that the Board 
was glad to allay the discontent it had aroused by 
granting the teachers the right to form a school coun- 
cil which must be consulted by the Board in all 
matters of policy. 

In spite of opposition the A. F. of T. has grown 
from 3,000 members in September 1918, to over 
10,000 in June 1919, with 103 branches in almost 
as many cities. The effort to place the profession 
upon a self-respecting basis will n6t down. For 
teachers have learned that unless they are entrusted 
with a vital share in the work of managing the 
schools, there is no hope for the schools or the 
profession.

The Place of the Community in the School 



O PHASE OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENT has 

been so rich in suggestion as the attempt to restore 
the community to the school. At bottom no other 
effort has been so poor in accomplishment. The 
educational system of New York or Boston or Chi- 
cago is still a self-contained unit, revolving within 
that wider system called the educational world ; and 
at best the grammar schools have only treated the 
word " community " as another element in their 
program which must be parsed and defined and 
exemplified and endlessly talked about. 

Nevertheless, both in America and England, small 
educational groups have supplemented the cut-and- 
dried dietary of formal education with a fresher 
and more appetizing kind of educational fare, culled 
from the contemporary workaday community. It 
may be worth while to examine definitely the nature 
of these experiments before attempting to appraise 
their weakness in bringing about any large scale 
renovatien comparable to that which is now going on 
in industry. 

In America the. attempt to bring the community 
into the school has taken the form of making the 
school itself a miniature community. The Gary plan 
for work, play, and study throughout the day is an 
example. The school plant itself is treated not as 
something apart from the book and paper equipment 
of the classroom but as a genuine educational equip- 
ment in its own right. Repairs are made in the 
building, its heating plant kept up, and its grounds 
are groomed in the interest of the learning pupil 



as well as by reason of practical necessity. The new 
school is really a justification of the educational in- 
sight of Mr. Squeers; for apart from the purely 
fortuitous brutality of Dickens' villain his chief 
monstrosity consists in having been born out of his 
due time. In the Porter School described by Evelyn 
Dewey (New Schools for Old; Dutton) the at- 
tempt is made to bring about the direct participation 
of the adult community, so that the mechanical par- 
tition between the school and the family, between 
academic work and " real " work, between study 
and life shall be broken down. While making con- 
tacts with the common stock of all lands and ages, 
-the school absorbs itself in the activities of the com- 
munity and acts as a meeting point for local and 
universal interests. Thus by turns, as demonstrators 
and lecturers in agriculture and the domestic arts 
were brought into Porter township, the school be- 
came the community's farm, its kitchen, its work- 
shop, its forum. 

In both the examples of Gary and Porter the 
essential point is the realization that the community 
itself is richer in educational resource than the 
school. The extent to which a child can live a 
well-rounded life during his school period is de- 
pendent upon the ability of the school to provide 
him with the cultural background of a complete 
community. In essence, the grammar school of 
Renaissance tradition was simply a devitalized com- 
munity, with its educative elements leached out. 
The magic of special subjects, apart from their value

in use, is /now recognized as the myth of a leisure 
class, and the effort of the modern school is accord- 
ingly to substitute for the fake discipline of formal 
education the genuine discipline of real work in a 
community. Up to the present the drill subject has 
remained in the school largely for the reason that 
drill itself has remained in the army: it is a means 
of killing time in the intervals that precede the per- 
formance of active duties. When you do away with 
these preparatory exercises you have only to thrust 
the student into an organized community and he will 
find it necessary to occupy himself with tasks of 
high educational importance, and the interests that 
these tasks awaken are the only stimuli needed to 
give the teacher his opportunity to guide and demon- 
strate and coordinate and direct. Where drill itself 
is justified the Gary teachers have shown how it 
may be coupled to a non-academic task. 

This emphasis upon the group life, from which 
the school, with its armory of arts and sciences, has 
sprung, affects the technique of teaching, the equip- 
ment of the school plant, and the development of the 
curriculum. The last two items are of especial note, 
for apart from experiments like those at Fairhope 
and Gary, the methods of elementary teaching, under 
the influence of such institutes as Columbia, 'have 
vastly improved during the last generation. In the 
modern school the old quarrel between the advocates 
of the fixed curriculum and those who favored elec- 
tives loses its last vestige of reality when the condi- 
tions and needs of the community rather than those 
of the school system are taken into consideration. 
This is recognized in the report of the Commission 
on the Reorganization of Secondary Education, 
authorized by the National Education Association. 
(Bulletin No. 35, 1918; Bureau of Education.) 
The committee which brought in the report found 
that the seven main objectives which should deter- 
mine all education were : Health, command of fun- 
damental processes, worthy home membership, voca- 
tion, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical 
character ; in short, as Dr. Snedden has suggested in 
a criticism, health education, vocational education, 
and social education. (Snedden: Cardinal Prin- 
ciples of Secondary Education; School and Society, 
IX, 227.) This implies a point to point correspond- 
ence of the student's functions with those of the 
community. 

Considering merely the curriculum there remains 
a question as to how much of the community can 
be brought back into the school, even with such a 
wide use of the school plant, and such an extension 
of the equipment, as is required in the Gary method. 
A New York school may run a bank of its own to 
vivify the problems of accountancy, but it cannot 
possess the Stock Exchange; a Pittsburgh school 



may have a foundry, but it cannot operate a rolling 
mill; a Chicago school may have a leatherworking 
shop, but; it cannot run the stockyards; a Vermont 
school may be built on a vein of marble, but it can- 
not work a quarry. Yet it is safe to say that the 
operations I have mentioned are each and all full 
of educational interest, and that an understanding 
of them is peculiarly essential to anyone desirous 
of functioning intelligently within the region where 
they are dominant. In addition to this broad 
industrial environment, in which the large cities 
have so much to offer, every community has par- 
ticular resources, natural and cultural, which can 
never be completely engrossed by the school, and 
which it would be folly to attempt to duplicate. In 
spite of routine trips to museums and . zoos this 
larger environment has been neglected in America. 
Nowhere has the school begun to exploit the insti- 
tutions of the community. Whereas American 
initiative is responsible for the experiment of bring- 
ing back the community to the school, it is to Great 
Britain that we must turn for example as to the 
method of taking the school out into the community. 

The use of the community in extending and deep- 
ening the interests embraced by the school is con- 
nected in England with the movement for regional 
survey. Before the war the survey method as an 
educational instrument was developed in Edinburgh, 
Lambeth, and Saffron Walden under the inspiration 
of Professor Patrick Geddes, the biologist, sociolo- 
gist, and educator. (A discussion of its application 
may be found in a memoir on Alasdair Geddes, pub- 
lished first in the Town Planning Review, April, 
1917, and later in the series of Papers for the Pres- 
ent, Headley Brothers, London.) 

The aim of the regional survey is to employ the 
immediate region as the starting point of the stu- 
dent's inquiries into the arts and sciences. Instead 
of letting the student begin his studies with names 
and definitions the regional t surveyor insists upon 
prefacing this thin, verbal and symbolical knowledge 
about " subjects " with a thick, first-hand, intimate, 
concrete acquaintance with his environment. This 
acquaintance with the crude data of the arts and 
sciences is something the drill school, at all its levels, 
takes for granted. It relies upon casual acquaint- 
ances and intimacies to furnish the substantial 
ground pattern upon which it embroiders its abstract 
interpretations and studies. Hence, for example, the 
student of chemistry in a New York school may 
" know " the atomic formula of clay before he has 
felt clay in his hands, or has connected it with build- 
ing, or has watched the barges of bricks float down 
the Hudson, or has examined the conditions under 
which it is worked, or has attained the dimmest 
sociological insight into the life of a river village 



246

that has claymaking as its sole industry. Or at 
another period the student may study the develop- 
ment of America after the Civil War, and read 
about the influx of immigrants and the numerical 
growth of cities, without even faintly associating 
this with the huddle of loft buildings in the lower 
part of Manhattan and the congestion of population 
in the adjacent East Side. The failure to subor- 
dinate book knowledge to immediate observation 
and experiment is notorious. It results in a thinness 
of mental imagery which makes for looseness and 
vagueness of thought. By embracing, not the arts 
and sciences considered abstractly as subjects, but 
the actual synthesis of the arts and sciences as ex- 
pressed concretely in the life-processes of the com- 
munity, the regional survey seeks to repair this 
deficiency. 

In America indeed Dr. Flexner has pointed out 
how many institutions in the city might be utilized 
for educational purposes by the modern school. (A 
Modern School; General Education Board, New 
York.) What is emphasized in the regional 
survey is that the city-region as a whole may be 
treated as an educational institution, and that every 
phase of its existence may be utilized to vivify every 
part of the school's curriculum. The technique 
of utilizing this wider environment has yet to be 
elaborated. Experiment along these lines, however, 
cannot proceed far until the method itself is widely 
explored under test conditions with teachers of 
normal training and classes of mean size. This 
leads us back to our original point of departure: 
the paucity, not of initiative, but of application. 

It appears that the prime elements that stand in 
the way both of the American scheme of bringing 
the community into the school, and the British plan 
of taking the school out into the community are 
two: the strength of the traditional educational 
system itself, considered as a machine, and the self- 



centeredness of the adult population, both at home 
and in the shop. In new communities like Gary, 
and in small ones like Porter, the vested educational 
regime is too infirm to entrench itself against inno- 
vation. In Gary, accordingly, the initiative of Wil- 
liam Wirt effected an easy transformation of the 
school program and equipment; and in Porter the 
active support of the community played no small part 
in bringing in an experimentally disposed teacher 
and affording her an opportunity for carrying out 
her plans. But where instead of an active and re- 
sponsible guild of teachers there is a centralized 
bureaucracy, and instead of an interested and pur- 
poseful community there is merely the apathetic rab- 
ble of individuals that makes up a city tenement dis- 
trict, the introduction of any genuine educational 
advance is seriously hindered. Unless public opinion 
can be formulated through active Parent's Associa- 
tions and professional opinion through Teacher's 
Associations, the most sober advances will be seri- 
ously hindered; for the reason that they call for 
difficult adjustments in the education machine and 
indeed in the very organization of the industrial 
community. The use of the community by the school 
implies the active cooperation of the community in 
the school. 

Obviously then if our educational experiments 
are not to languish and to die in isolation they must 
connect themselves with the interests of active occu- 
pational groups. That is why the organization of 
teachers' unions in our larger cities, weak though 
the impulse yet , remains, is the most promising 
sign on the educational horizon. If the teacher 
is able to reestablish his economic and intellectual 
position in the school he may 'be able to gain 
a new place for the school in the community. 
The opportunity deliberately to utilize the com- 
munity for educational purposes will follow.

American History Anglicized 



A HE EDITOR OF THE DIAL sends me two books 
and writes, " Please review/' I read the two books 
Elizabethan Sea-Dogs, by William Wood, and 
Dutch and English on the Hudson, by Maud Wil- 
der Goodwin, being Vol. 3 and Vol. 7 of the Chron- 
icles of America published by the Yale University 
Press. Then I sent word to the editor of THE DIAL 
and said, " Please allow me to decline the honor." 
Wrote the editor of THE DIAL, "Why?" And 
I answered, " Because you will not like what I want 
to say. Besfdes it may cost me twenty years in jail." 
Whereupon the patient editor remarked " that ac- 
cording to the courts of West Virginia the war 
ended when the Armistice was declared " and 
gave me full power to state, write, and declare what 
I have intended to state, write, and declare since 
many years. 

A few weeks ago there was a delegation of South 
African Boers in this town. We had speech together 
and we discussed affairs in the old independent Re- 
publics of the Black Continent. We exhausted all 
arguments pro and con and finally I asked, " What 
makes for the dislike between Boer and British?" 
The leader of the delegation puffed his pipe medi- 
tatively and then said, " I don't want to be too 
sensitive. But the reason for the continued dislike 
is the following. Language and habits and customs 
have really nothing to do with it. It is not a ques- 
tion of race or economic status. But the Englishman 
simply cannot treat us as an equal. He probably 
tries to be pleasant. He never gets over an attitude 
of amused patronizing. We Boers feel it. We are 
made to feel it all the time. We despair of changing 
the English character. Therefore we want to go 
our own way." 

That is the reason why I did not want to review 
these two books. History, like all teaching, has been 
(speaking very broadly) the privilege of what is 
sometimes called " the New England school ma'am." 
With all due respect for the integrity, intellectual 
honesty, and purity of historical purpose of the 
aforementioned New England school ma'am, she 
never learned languages. England and English 
scholarship were the fount of her perennial in- 
formation. That same undefinable but very con- 
crete method of settling all foreign aspirations 
to glory and fame by a slight smile and a 
prolonged " Ah, very interesting indeed " was ap- 
plied to history with a result exceedingly disastrous 
to all foreigners. It was duly accepted that these 
United States, notwithstanding a slight difference 
of opinion during the last half of the eighteenth cen- 



tury were a sort of intellectual colony of the British 
mother country. That Magna Charta, sublimated 
into the constitution of the great Republic, was the 
foundation of all further democratic development. 
That Anglo-Saxon virtue accounted for everything 
that was good on this vast continent. Of course 
there were certain foreign influences which had con- 
tributed towards folk-dancing and amusing little 
restaurants in Greenwich Village. But these were 
quite negligible compared to the greater blessings 
carried across the ocean in English bottoms. And 
the sooner the " foreigner " accepted this fact, 
dropped his strange notions of cultural equality, the 
better for him arid the prosperity of his children. For 
a moment, the Lafayette myth, a by-product of our 
war-enthusiasm, threatened to obscure the deeds of 
the Knights of Runymede. M. Clemenceau's atti- 
tude at the peace table will soon cause a revision of 
this incident and the English tradition will again 
rule supreme. 

These two little books, neither of them a contri- 
bution to the subject of early American settlement 
from a scholarly point of view read to me like an 
expression of that regretable attitude. Maybe 
very likely even my old Dutch prejudice makes me 
unfair. But I get everlastingly, profoundly, and ir- 
ritatingly tired of Drake's exploits in " clipping the 
wings of Spain " when said Drake ought to have 
only fifty per cent of the glory; of the great epic of 
glorious Queen Bess, when this distinguished Lady 
ought to suffer a fifty per cent reduction of 
her fame; of the endlessly repeated story of the 
Armada which hogs the happy result of that moment- 
ous battle entirely for the benefit of British valor, 
British seamanship, and British pluck. I have the 
greatest respect for these three phenomena of the 
British character. But please! give the other fellow 
a chance. The low countries along the banks of 
the North Sea had a popular representative system, 
guaranteed by seigneurial writ, long before an Eng- 
lish commoner dreamed of demanding the right of 
representation exercised by a small score of nobles. 
The Armada was defeated with the help of God, 
the British fleet, and a highly efficient Dutch Squad- 
ron which blockaded the Duke of Parma and his 
auxiliary ships and troops in the harbor of Dunkirk 
until Sidonia's galleons were ready to be slaugh- 
tered. As for the clipped wings of Spain, why 
create the impression that this much-needed task was 
entrusted by Providence exclusively to the seadogs of 
Queen Bess? . 

It is the same with the volume on the Dutch and 



248

English on the Hudson. The very least one can ask 
of an author writing about Dutch subjects is such a 
rudimentary knowledge of the Dutch language that 
at least one out of every four quotations shall be 
spelled correctly. At this late date it is quite futile 
to hope that the harm done by the Knickerbocker 
History of New York will ever be undone. The 
early settlers of New York will go down in history 
as funny lethargic Burghers with immense steins of 
beer and long Gouda pipes. Miss Goodwin's book 
avoids this error and on the whole , tries to give a 
fair deal to the risky investment of the West Indian 
Company. But again, on every page one feels the ut- 
ter lack of comprehension of the Dutch background. 
Speaking in a general way that does not matter very 
much. Just now, nothing matters very much except 
the Smolny Institute and Versailles. But a century 
from now, when the world runs again in its quiet 



and peaceful groove, we hope that our American 
writers (I am not speaking of our scholars) will see 
a new light. The role of the small nation in the 
concert of nations has been persistently misunder- 
stood. Just as the League of Nations offered to 
run the affairs of the world by an executive council 
of five big powers (and mind my prophetic words, 
O ye Lords of Versailles! you cannot do it), in the 
same way our amateur historians have provided a 
certain conception of history which teaches our chil- 
dren that the real work of growth and development 
was performed 'by the Big Empires while the small 
fry filled out the little gaps in the imposing edifice 
of human civilization. The reviewer sees these 
things fundamentally different. Hence he repeats 
his request. " Let some one else review these books." 

HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON. 



I 



Fashions in Conspiracy 



T is JUST AS WELL not to look for romantic 
thrills in scholastic monographs, for heart-sickness 
would surely follow on hope long deferred. Yet 
Professor Vernon Stauffer has provided them in 
" Whole Number 191 " of the Columbia Univer- 
sity Studies in History, Economics, and Public 
Law. (New England and the Bavarian Illum- 
inati; Columbia University Press.) It is not 
easy to explain why the book is so interesting, for 
a brief summary is no more exhilarating than the 
imprint, or the title, or the pale blue tint of the 
paper binding. 

Boiled down to lowest terms and served up in a 
saucerful of negations the story of the play amounts 
to this: I. After the Revolution New England 
was deeply disturbed and demoralized yet not so 
deeply as it might have been (141 pages). II. The 
Bavarian Order of the Illuminati founded in 1776 
was a secret, radical organization of immense poten- 
tial influence but it was crushed before it had 
reached full power (87 pages). III. The menace 
of a supposed revival toward the end of the cen- 
tury produced a near panic among New England 
conservatives but the whole episode was really a 
tempest in a teapot (116 pages). Curtain that is, 
bibliography. 

To the objector who says that this is. a sheer 
sequence of anti-climaxes there is only one reply. 
The man who must have something happen in ever}' 
story will lay this one aside in contempt; he had 
better not bother with it at all. Yet, of course, 
objective adventure amounts to nothing in itself. 



Except for the attending emotions, an event is like 
a ship at sea sunk without a trace; but the frustra- 
tion of a plan to sink ships " spurlos " is as big 
with emotional significance as the loss of a Lusi- 
tania. Every lively reader is a bit like Wilde's 
Gwendolen when she says, " The suspense is ter- 
rible ... I hope it will last." 

Seen in this light, the Stauffer monograph has all 
the lure of a penny-dreadful, and all the learning 
that does credit to its solemn auspices. It is docu- 
mented at all points and featured on every page 
with " an angry little pack of footnotes barking 
at the text." But it is humanly and dramatically 
interesting because it is a well-written chronicle 
of human hopes and fears. The first part, on the 
undermining of Puritan standards and institutions, 
is a fresh and well-considered statement of what is 
familiar to every student of American history. The 
grip of the Church was relaxed. Education for the 
ministry was no longer the chief mission of the col- 
leges, and the students inclined toward radicalism 
,of thinking and adopted it as a cloak for license. 
Not only were the strictest amusement taboos lifted, 
but gambling at the card table and the racetrack, 
heavy drinking, and sexual license were on the in- 
crease. The alarm was widespread that these vices 
were natural resultants of religious radicalism and 
skepticism. 

The sections on the European Order of the Il- 
luminati, and on the subsequent Illuminati agita- 
tion in New England, are fresh fields for most 
readers. The almost absolute control which the 



1919

Society of Jesus had contrived to secure in Bavaria 
led to an inevitable revolt in the period of the 
Aufklarung toward the end of the eighteenth cen- 
tury. Under the lead of Adam Weishaupt (1748- 
1830) a secret association was founded in 1776 to 
outwit the enemies of reason throughout the world. 
Its members were to be trained and learned laborers 
for a new civilization. An exhaustive study of 
mankind and the development of a skilled propa- 
gandist method were to result in a moral trans- 
formation of human society. The design was thus 
to carry out an enlightened and bloodless revolu- 
tion. Unfortunately jealousy and ineptitude re- 
tarded its growth at first, and later treachery com- 
pleted the revelations which official vigilance had 
begun. By 1784 the organization was quite com- 
pletely smashed; but its real influence was greatly 
increased. The repressive measures boomeranged 
as they always do, ultra conservatism became queru- 
lously shrill, officialdom began once more to jump 
at its own shadow, and every radical thinker was 
cheered by the gratuitous advertisement given to 
his cause and was encouraged by the rumors of its 
strength. Even at this, however, the whole II- 
luminati movement might have sunk into oblivion 
by 1798 as Weishaupt himself had done, if in that 
year there had not appeared in Edinburgh a volume 
by John Robison containing " Proofs of a Con- 
spiracy against All the Religions and Governments 
of Europe, carried on in the Secret Meetings of the 
Free Masons, Illuminati and Reading Societies." 
Seven editions of this soon ran their course in Eng- 
lish, French, German, and Dutch and a very pretty 
panic was restimulated. According to Robison the 
Illuminati had brought about the French Revolu- 
tion under " specious pretexts of enlightening the 
world," and emboldened by their success were 
working secretly in all the countries of Europe. 

It was not to be expected that jn the fallow New 
England ground so fruitful -a rumor should fail to 
scatter seed. By fast-day of 1798 the warning was 
solemnly uttered, and within the next two years 
pulpits and pamphlets had presented, circumstantial 
evidence of active conspiracy. These proofs may 
have proved something besides the solicitude of the 
men who advanced them, though they do not seem 
to have done so. This is important in estimating 
Professor -Stauffer's monograph as a historical 
document; but if we consider the monograph as a 
document on public opinion, it is a negligible 
matter. What Macaulay wrote about popular 
faiths is equally true of popular fears: " Logicians 
may reason about abstractions, but the great mass 
of men must have images." Radicalism was in the 



air; the body of conservative thinkers needed to 
account for the unrest. They could not concede 
that it sprang from the essential wrongness of 
human conditions, for that is in itself a radical con- 
tention. The inclination to disturb the good old 
ways must be accounted for by the exercise of some 
fell conspiracy. So " the Illuminati, the Free 
Masons, and the Reading Societies " were set up 
as the straw men. 

The Illuminati could not be embarrassed by such 
an agitation, for the simple reason that specters and 
hobgoblins are not subject to courts of inquiry. 
The scattered and unrelated reading rooms were 
little disturbed, because no case could be made 
against them. But the Freemasons furnished a 
beautiful target for miscellaneous bombardment. 
They were secret and hence had something dread- 
ful to conceal. They observed rituals of their own 
which were doubtless anti-ecclesiastical and prob- 
ably anti-religious. On the other hand they were 
exclusive, and hence undemocratic and perchance 
reactionary. They pleased no one outside their 
ranks, and were hard beset until, with the mourn- 
ing for George Washington, his membership in a 
secret order gave the Masons a bill of exemption 
before the court of public opinion. So the excite- 
ment waned, and the Bavarian Illuminati, who had 
never been terrible except in the imaginations of 
the ultra-conservatives, ceased to be accused of an 
influence that they had never been strong enough 
to exert. 

It is a quaint and significant piece of history, and 
furnishes a striking parallel to the rumored dangers 
and the reactionary alarums of today. With the 
closing of one chapter in the struggle for democ- 
racy, the cry was raised against its " desolating 
effects," and conservative America began to chant 
the hymn of prudential patriotism. Hail Columbia 
was a by-product of the agitation, written on re- 
quest in 1 798 by a son of one of the signers of the 
Declaration. It sounds as paltry now as it must 
have then, but its sentiments are still being pro- 
claimed with the same tremulous fervor: 

Let independence be your boast 
Ever mindful what it cost, 
Ever grateful for the prize 
Let its altar reach the skies. 

Firm, united let us be, 
Rallying round our liberty, 
As a band of brothers joined", 
Peace and safety let us find. 

Of a truth history repeats itself. The story of New 
England and the Bavarian Illuminati is amazingly 
up-to-date.

The Mood of the Morning After 



J. HE END OF THE WAR will presumably also close 
a prolific phase of literary activity, the production 
of war books, which a recent writer has divided into 
four groups : the impressionistic, the episodic, the his- 
torical, and the technical. With Leonhard Frank's 
Der Mensch 1st Gut (Rascher; Zurich) we might 
add another type, the inspired or, shall we say? 
the prophetic. This last will depend on the sort of 
lesson that the present and the future generations 
to whom Leonhard Frank dedicates his book will 
have learned from the world war. No better text- 
book- could be found to teach man the ways of peace 
and to point out the true deadliness of militarism in 
its effect on the mind and spirit of man. A nation 
thoroughly drilled in militarism is no longer respon- 
sible for its 1 actions, he says ; it no longer consists of 
human beings, but of soulless, irresponsible automa- 
tons, incapable of thought. We have readily be- 
lieved this of the Germans, but signs of apprehen- 
sion must deepen in view of the dark cloud of uni- 
versal military training, as a permanent institution, 
that is hovering over our own country. 

The book consists of five sketches: The Father, 
The War Widow, The Mother, The Lovers, and 
The War Cripples. The style is unusually vivid 
and gripping, and the psychologic penetration and 
descriptive directness cast a spell over the reader 
that would almost inevitably bring him to his feet to 
rush out into the street and join the crusaders, if he 
were near the scene of action. 

The Father of the first sketch is a commonplace 
hotel waiter. Dazed by the news of his son's death 
" on the field of honor," he ruminates listlessly for 
weeks on that word "honor." Honor, honor, the 
field of honor what is this honor? It is no field, 
no acre, no surface, neither mist nor air it is ab- 
solutely nothing. Slowly the truth begins to dawn, 
and slowly, deliberately he prepares for the " leap " 
that he knew he must take some day. A laborers' 
convention, at which he officiated in the capacity of 
water-carrier to the speakers, and a toy gun fur- 
nished the occasion. He held up the gun which he 
himself long ago had presented to his little son, re- 
called the toy-soldiers, drums, and uniforms, and 
said : " I am a murderer." And you, who have also 
brought up your children on toys like these, who have 
connived at all this ghastly masquerade, who in your 
misery have rejoiced when it was the enemy's son, or 
husband, or father, or sweetheart that was killed and 
not your own, you all are murderers. There is not a 
person in Europe today who is not a murderer, and 
we are murderers, because we have forgotten love. 
In insane delusion we think we see the foe outside of 



us, in the Russian, the Englishman, the Frenchman, 
because the real foe, who is within us, is something 
that is not there the absence of love. Cringing 
obedience to authority, unthinking worship of suc- 
cess, money, and power, and sixteen thousand kilo- 
meters of corpses, because we have the courage to kill 
men but not the courage to love them, that is our 
civilization. Words like these fall naturally and 
simply from lips that have been trained only to ob- 
sequiousness. Man is good. 

The War Widow is a tour de force of psychologic 
analysis. She too went about her business and 
walked the streets like an automaton her eyes dry, 
her heart empty but for the hatred that barred it to 
grief, her brain in a chaos. The phrases: a hero's 
death, the field of honor, the altar of the Fatherland, 
a million other women, were jumbled together with 
the high prices of coffee and eggs, all equally mean- 
ingless. This lasted for months, and her features 
settled into hard lines when the hotel waiter's words 
pierced the crust, opening her heart to grief and her 
eyes to a new and wonderful light. 

Somewhat different was the lot of the Mother. 
Her whole life is merged in the life of the son at 
the front. Her solicitude makes her clairvoyant. She 
spends her days and nights in agonizing appeals to 
him to fire or to desist from firing, according as her 
fear for her son's life or her anguish at the vision 
of the other mother in Paris gains the upper hand. 
When the inevitable news reaches her she darts out 
into the street and runs aimlessly, silently, till the 
cry of anguish breaks forth' and pierces the air. The 
cry of anguish of the European mother. At last, 
snatching a crucifix from the altar of a church, she 
heads a procession of mothers and joins the multi- 
tudes led by the hotel waiter. 

In The Lovers the philosopher, in spite of his 
gloomy survey of a people calloused, thoughtless, 
over-organized, drilled by machine and musket to 
the point of fatalism, a people whom nothing but 
naked hunger can arouse to revolutionary protest, is 
at last shaken by wild love and compassion at the 
thought of the unborn soul of his sleeping wife, the 
symbol of the unborn soul of the people. Instead 
of choosing suicide for the second time in response 
to the military summons, he resolves to plunge into 
the midst of the blood-soaked presence and the 
blood-soaked masses and to join those who have been 
saved from the poison of organization in an attempt 
" to talk the people out of that which has been talked 
into them for decades." ' 

The War Cripples reveals the gruesome spectacle 
of the " slaughter house," as the field hospital is

called. The field-surgeon, who literally saws till he 
drops, awakens from the swoon into which he has 
sunk from over-fatigue, into a great illumination. 
For three years he has sawed off soldiers' arms and 
legs; henceforth his life is dedicated to the preven- 
tion of the necessity for sawing off arms and legs. 

There are no seismographs that record an earthquake 
before it has become a fact. But there are seismographs 
of the soul, men who feel when the moment has come 
when the hardened petrified woe of an entire, suppressed, 
inconceivably tormented people suddenly melts and bursts 
the dams of organized force, power, falsehood, authority 
and misconceived duty. 

At that moment the field-surgeon opened the doors 
of a new age with his procession of cripples. Twenty 
thousand, fifty thousand, a never ending throng, on 
crutches, and on trucks they come, with artificial 
limbs and artificial features the blind led by the 



halt. The light of a new day of the brotherhood of 
man transfigures the face of the most hopeless of 
them all, the armless and legless trunk. And he, the 
nameless one, who has been walking beside the hotel 
waiter, enters the halls of the old regime, and the 
old regime disappears forever. 

The vision is Leonhard Frank's Revolution, stalk- 
ing through the world perhaps. Is it going to pro- 
claim international brotherhood? Or will the new 
impetus towards nationalistic development, the old 
possessive impulses, the old industrialism, not set up 
new barriers between man and man on the ruins of 
the old autocracies? Whatever the immediate out- 
come, the internationalist has nevertheless come to 
stay and Leonhard Frank is one of the prophets of 
the true goal of human progress.

Nietzsche Without Prejudice 



KNOW OF NO BOOK on Nietzsche that even ap- 
proaches the excellence of Nietzsche the Thinker, 
by William Salter (Holt). The motive and 
character of Nietzsche's thinking, the passion of his 
manner, and the shock and challenge of his phrase 
are all so intimate, so idiosyncratic, as to call forth 
from his critics and commentators discussions equally 
idiosyncratic, with personal bias and divergent per- 
spectives. All, from Vaihinger and Lichtenberger to 
Thierry and Huneker, draw portraits of the mind of 
Nietzsche which reveal their authors far more than 
their subject. That (as the psychologizing critic 
modernly assures us) this observation holds of all 
criticism makes no matter; there are degrees. Some 
critics are more translucent than others and some 
subjects more luminous. And Nietzsche seems to 
have been a writer who has influenced his readers 
more through heat than through light. He has 
warmed or fired many of both his opponents and his 
admirers into good writing down of themselves, but 
never of a true vision of the Nietzsche that was. 
Rarely has there lived a man so irrelevant to the 
ruling passions of his time and so provocative of 
them. With the effect that what the public reads 
and says about him is the substance of an interna- 
tional myth, none the less potent because it is a myth, 
while what he was and thought in himself goes un- 
observed and forgotten. 

It is the great merit of Mr. Salter's book, cer- 
tainly the best book on Nietzsche in the English 
language and perhaps in any language, that it disre- 
gards the myth and attains to the Nietzschean mind 
itself. Few men of letters have had so self-effacing 
and pellucid an interpreter, who so conscientiously 



and with such detailed and workmanlike skill has 
^brought together all their utterances on any given 
theme, and exhibited concept after concept in its 
intricate intellectual pattern with all the reserva- 
tions, nuances, shadings, and stresses of all the dif- 
ferent times and places of their deliverance. Nietz- 
sche surely never had such an interpreter before. 
You are made to feel as in no other book that the 
content of Nietzsche's whole mind is really and 
truly there and its contact with what you have 
yourself read in Nietzsche and what you have read 
about him is dramatically poignant. Yet, after 
a while, you find accompanying this realization also 
a discommoding sense of uncertainty and unreality. 
You know that this account of Nietzsche shows you 
the substance of his mind and that others do not, but 
you cannot help feeling that the cohesive force which 
holds together simultaneously the countless parts of 
this remarkable mosaic of ideas, the center of life 
and feeling which holds them in mutuality and or- 
ganic relevance, is not that of Nietzsche. The sense 
of values the ensemble of this book awakens in you 
and the sense that you attain from a reading of 
Nietzsche's works in the order in which he wrote 
them are as a sense of sugar and salt. Not only do 
they not fuse, they repel one another; and the 
harsher and more true is closer to the Nietzschean 
myth than to the Nietzschean fact. In a word, Mr. 
Salter's portrait of Nietzsche's mind is marvelously 
accurate, but it is not a true portrait. It is not a 
true portrait perhaps just because it is so accurate. 
The complex of impulses and repressions which 
were Nietzsche's life, its central elan, that found its 
fulfillment, gratification, compensation, or diversion

in one after another of the succession of ideas that 
are the portrait, is itself missing from the portrait. 
The rhythm and pulse of it are as little Nietzsche's 
as the ideas are completely Nietzsche's. This lack is 
rendered inevitable by Mr. Salter's method, which 
is structural rather than genetic and which postu- 
lates that a thinker's mind is a thing apart from his 
heart. In view of the method, Mr. Salter's achieve- 
ment is all the more remarkable. 

It is an achievement in exposition without ex- 
planation, and the separation of the two is inherent 
in the structural method. From the genetic point of 
view the^ cannot however be separated. After all, 
men are men before they are philosophers, and they 
are born with appetites, passions, impulsions, and in- 
stincts whereas they only acquire ideas. Their tem- 
peraments are the foundations of their minds; their 
feelings supply the power and dictate the goals of 
their intellects. Regarding a thinker so idiosyncratic 
and spontaneous as Nietzsche, this is particularly 
true. All theories of life are personal, and his was 
more so than most. That he had inherited a neuro- 
pathic constitution from his father's side of the 
family, that he was deeply devoted to his mother, 
that scarcely a day passed without acute physical 
pain or discomfort, that he was always under great 
physical strain, that he was celibate, that he at one 
time added to his involuntary pains those of self- 
inflicted bodily penance all these expressions of his 
diathesis must be taken into consideration if his out- 
look upon the nature and destiny of man is to be 
rightly understood. Against the background of this 
constant battle with weakness and weakening, the 
description of his philosophy as a " recipe and self- 
prepared medicine against life-weariness " becomes 
easily intelligible; so does his self-glorification, as in 
Ecce Homo; so does his passionate and bitter rejec- 
tion of all the standards and conventions of the 
society with which his weakness was associated, to 
which he attributed it, which he identified with it, 
and which he repudiated and rejected by his demand 
for a " new morality " that was after all nothing 
more than a projection of his own pain and struggle 
upon the cosmos, and a justification thereof. From 
the standpoint of his emotional life, his philosophy 
was partly a compensation for, partly a projection 
and rationalization of, his condition and its impli- 
cated temperament. It is the pathetic fallacy of a 
brave sick man, who had learned, or who perhaps 
did not need to learn, to take a masochistic joy in 
his sickness. 

The material .which was reshaped and thrown 
into new and tonic patterns by the selective action 
of the dominant impulsions of Nietzsche's tempera- 
ment came from three sources. The primary and 
most colorful was his varied and discriminating 



knowledge of the world of classical antiquity. It 
was not so great as that of many another man 
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, for example nor so ac- 
curate. His idiosyncrasies of emotion made him, 
however, sensitive to aspects of it which men of 
more usual diathesis never saw. These he selected 
and wove into the justification and sustainment of 
his bitter, brave existence. They grounded his con- 
ceptions of tragedy and of the origins of morality 
and enabled him to carry on. Schopenhauerian 
voluntarism and the Darwinian hypothesis supple- 
mented this aid and comfort. In his earlier days 
he had accepted the quietistic upshot of the former, 
had found satisfaction in its doctrine of self-efface- 
ment through art and religion. But as life and pain 
grew more difficult to endure he rejected the quiet- 
ism and cursed it. Being and pain and tragedy grew 
to be synonymous for him, and art ceased to be an 
escape and became a fulfillment of them: "in 
tragedy the warrior celebrates his Saturnalia." 
And, of course, the movements and interests current 
in the social organization bf his time moved him to 
vivid resentment. He selected for particular be- 
littlement its hunger for ease, comfort, and pleasure. 
The Christian virtues filled him with revulsion and 
the Christian beliefs with disgust : they involved the 
abolition of pain. The national and socialist move- 
ments seemed to him degrading and signs of de- 
cadence, just because they invaded the necessary and 
desirable loneliness of the voluntary sufferer, and 
his scorn of the Germans and their paternalistic im- 
perialism knew no bounds " the meanness of a 
German hinders digestion." His goal of life moral, 
intellectual, esthetic is self-immolation. The " su- 
perman," indeed may be said to have been con- 
ceived in the very ardor and ecstasy of self-immola- 
tion. Although the conception is shot through with 
certain ideas of excellence absorbed from the Greeks, 
and Nietzsche could plausibly be argued to have de- 
fined the aim of life as the spreading of a greater 
and firmer pedestal of the most powerful, the 
" best " type of beings, it is significant that this best 
had not, in Nietzsche's mind, either the definiteness 
or articulation which the classic conceptions all had. 
It exists rather as a rationalization of the process 
of becoming, which is all pain, all sorrow, all lone- 
liness; which is self-destruction. Since man is to 
superman what ape is to man, the best life for man 
can be nothing other than this process of self-de- 
struction. " Destroy yourself," says Nietzsche to 
his followers, " and your neighbor as yourself, in 
order that something better than you may come to 
be." All the while, however, the good to come is 
something unknown and unknowable; and the good 
that is, is your destruction.

When Good Fellows Get Together 



T THE LAST REUNION of our class there were, of 
course, the usual number of surprises. For in- 
stance, Gerald Braithwaite, who was at one time or 
another president of nearly all the college clubs and 
societies, a star actor in almost all the plays, some- 
thing of a singer, and good for a point or two in the 
high jump, has quieted down. Gerald is super- 
intendent of schools in some Middle-Western city. 
I suspect that Gerald blossomed out too soon, as 
plants are said to do when they are not adequately 
watered. But when I saw Gerald he suspected noth- 
ing. He liked his title and was sorry for me when 
I told him that I was still experimenting with life 
and had no steady job. 

Nearly all the rest had followed the paths of least 
resistance, not as any of us could have foreseen them, 
but as they could have been foreseen by any one 
familiar with American civilization fifteen years ago. 
Jackson, like Braithwaite, was one of our prominent 
men. He came to college from some country town, 
a shy, reserved, idealistic youth who had never ridden 
on a street car until he graduated from high school. 
Jackson rose by degrees, beginning with the Y. M. 
C. A., where his early religious training made him 
at home, becoming its vice-president, and emerging 
from it by way of atheism at the end of his second 
year. In his junior year he was treasurer of his 
class, and at the end of the year there was a sur- 
plus of nearly eighty-nine dollars an unheard of 
thing in our college. The year after that Jackson 
became advertising manager of the college monthly 
on a percentage basis. After he left college he went 
into real estate. When he came back to the re- 
union he had lost the soulful look and most of the 
wavy chestnut hair which had once made it easy 
for him to get dances at the proms, but he had a dou- 
ble chin and owned a controlling interest in a town 
of forty thousand inhabitants. 

The boys who went into law seemed the simplest 
to make predictions about, but the simplicity was 
deceptive. Jim Burnham, who was said to be the 
most brilliant man of his time, is still brilliant, but 
it is now an old-rose, Persian-carpet brilliancy. I 
caught in his conversation at the reunion little be- 
sides echoes of 1903. Jim had an uncle who was 
counsel for the Coast and Mid-Western. He came 
to the reunion in an expensive touring car, and 
thought that there was not much moral difference 
between Bolshevism and government control of the 
railroads. Culver drifted into politics, but instead 
of being governor or United States senator he was 
an assistant district attorney. He talked like Mr. 
Serjeant Buzfuz. Ed Bilkins, the inconsolable 



radical of his class, whose quarrel with the present 
order of society extended even to a refusal to wear a 
dress suit to the senior prom, went into journalism. 
He has become managing editor of a newspaper in 
a medium-sized Ohio city, and gets along famously 
with the owner and the advertisers. His wife is 
trying, not without success, to get into really good 
society. 

We had looked to Theodore Blackwood to give 
the class literary standing. Theodore stayed on at 
college after the rest of the class had gone away 
I believe because he could not think of anything else 
to do. He is now teaching English in a fresh-water 
college. It has been nine or ten years since he 
wrote any of that glowing, rebellious verse which 
used to excite admiration among the elect when it 
was printed in the Spade (our little modernist semi- 
annual, reserved for those who felt themselves of 
too fine clay to be appreciated by the general college 
public), but he has a new interpretation of the fifty- 
sixth line of Scene Five, Act II, of As You Like It, 
which is said to find favor with Shakespearean schol- 
ars. He tpld me that he was shortly to issue a 
new edition of Euphues, with critical notes. 

I see that I have said nothing of the part our 
class played in the war, but this is not because any 
of us were slackers. We were nearly all too old for 
front-line service, but a few of us did get to the front, 
and most of the rest took government contracts, got 
into the Red Cross or Y. M. C. A., took part in the 
Liberty Loan campaigns, or at least cut down our 
personal expenditures. There is a grave or two 
in France to which our chairman referred in what 
seemed to me the only unaffected words he spoke. 
They had not been prominent men in college. One 
had worked his way through by waiting on table. 
Few of us had even known them'. But now they 
were ours. 

Everything went off pretty well as long as we 
all kept together. Most of us were able to sing the 
songs, with a little prompting, and Burnham made 
a good toastmaster. It was when we began to split 
up that conversation became trying. After Jack- 
son had tried to sell me a lot, and Burnham had got 
me into a corner to explain what a good idea it 
would be to make the Espionage Act permanent, I 
made my escape and walked up and down in the 
moonlight the same moonlight, God forgive us! 
trying to figure everything out. My classmates re- 
minded me of nothing but clothes, possessions, so- 
cial relations, business and professional positions. 
Most of them, when they were in college, had been 
interested in subjects which had nothing to do with 



254 



THE DIAL

their personal welfare. On occasion they would 
throw off even the foolish garments of " college 
spirit " and " tradition " and analyze the educa- 
tional scheme of which they were a part. I had 
discussed religion, art, music, and Socialism with 
some of them until two in the morning. Now they 
would not discuss anything. It was as though the 
world contained for them no more doubts and mys- 
teries, or perhaps as though their opinions were 
balanced so precariously, and so intimately asso- 
ciated with their positions in the world, that they 
were afraid to think. 

Was this merely the result of growing older? I 
could not see why it should be. The age of specula- 
tion does not terminate normally at twenty-two or 
twenty-three. No, something had intervened to 
harden my classmates in their shells, like so many oys- 
ters growing encased before their time. Then I saw, 
or thought I saw, what the trouble was. Our col- 
lege had prided itself on preparing men for their 
" places in the world." A great point had been 
made of convincing the boys who passed through 
the mill that they were to become " leaders." The 
college was proud of those of its graduates who had 
been successful, especially if they had made money 
successfully. We were trained to use the world, 
not to understand it. Our whole academic tradi- 
tion and environment had worked toward accustom- 
ing us to forms and formulas. The president's 
colonial mansion on the hill had been a symbol of 
success, the assistant professor of Greek doing the 
family washing on the back porch a symbol of at 
least relative failure. Instead of being urged to 
keep our intellectual curiosity awake we had been 
fairly compelled to direct it into narrower and nar- 
rower channels, and to apply it to definite ends 
which were measured at las^ by the amount of 
money they brought in. We went out ashamed 
to be poor. I remembered some splendid words of 
William James: " We have lost the power even of 
imagining what the ancient idealization of poverty 
could have meant; the liberation from material at- 
tachments, the unbribed soul, the manlier indiffer- 



ence, the paying our way by what we are and not 
by what we have, the right to fling away our life 
at any moment irresponsibly." Had any of us ex- 
ercised that right? Yes, our service flag answered 
that question. But that sacrifice had been an acci- 
dent of history, performed in the teeth of our edu- 
cation, a breaking away from the environment in 
which we had been taught to be at home and to 
be imprisoned by not a development out of it. 

As I went out to get my hat and coat I met Peter 
Brant. When he was in college Peter Brant had 
been passionately interested in beetles. As I talked 
with him I saw that he was still interested in them, 
though more in people and travels. He had been 
hunting specimens all over the world in China, 
Siberia, Siam, India, Africa, South America, and 
the East and West Indies. He had made, he told 
me, one of the most complete beetle collections in 
the world, though as he had no income of his own 
he had had to earn his way around by selling his 
collection to a museum. From his pocket, how- 
ever, he drew a cigarette box, opened it reverently, 
and showed me a tiny black object. He had picked 
it up in Nigeria, and it was named after him. There 
was not another like it in any collection in the 
world. For the rest he had stories of out-of-the 
way ports, sleepy tropic rivers, and half-forgotten 
towns and people, out of the main currents of civ- 
ilization, and a confession about a girl from Indiana, 
with whom he had fallen hopelessly in love 
in Cairo. He had wanted to marry her, but marry- 
ing meant settling down, and perhaps giving up bee- 
tles. He was on his way to Australia, and hoped 
he would get over it. 

I left Brant, rather reluctantly, at the door of a 
second-class hotel, and went off to catch a train. 
Some words quoted in John Richard Green's His- 
tory were running in my head : " I have given up 
my whole soul to the Greek learning, and as soon 
as I get money I shall buy Greek books and then I 
shall buy some clothes." But I doubt if Brant had 
ever heard of Erasmus.

The Old Order and the New 



I HE PLUMB PLAN WILL BE MR. GOMPERS' TEST. 
While the President of the Trade Unions is no less 
loquacious than the President of the Republic, Mr. 
Gompers is not advertising his difficulty in advance. 
Mr. Wilson, operating in the field of politics, 
gambled on the insufficient vision of the average 
voter to recognize the corrosive effect of suppressing 
the efforts of a foreign people to establish self-gov- 
ernment. He gave the people whom he represented 
the lie, without taking serious chances. But this is 
not possible in the labor world. Mr. Gompers 
knows that at the present moment he has no such 
margin in which he can play a fast and loose game. 
The Plumb Plan "has fired the imagination of the 
labor world and precipitated a drive of immeasura- 
ble force because it marks a consummating step in 
the long preparation of labor toward participation 
in the control of industry. Mr. Gompers has al- 
ways declared that labor would never be satisfied; 
that it would continuously ask for more and again 
for more. While the gains made by the unions thus 
far have amounted in reality to little more than a 
gesture, the expectation of actual or net increase is 
the raison d'etre of membership. The function of 
the trade union officials is to keep expectation alive; 
and for the most part sops to Cerberus have, until 
now, sufficed. As a matter of fact sops were about 
all that could be had while the mass of workers be- 
lieved as their officials and their employers did that 
the production of wealth is a game of exploitation, 
where no one gives or shares more than he is forced 
to; that the business of alj is simply to get. As 
labor people were obviously less qualified to play the 
game than their employers or the financiers, the 
leadership of the general enterprise also obviously be- 
longed to these men. While the A. F. of L. has 
basd its organization on the recognition of that in- 
dustrial leadership, there is an insidious idea back 
of the trade union movement which employers have 
instinctively feared, and with good reason. Any 
organization or movement that is fed. on anticipation 
must, out of psychological necessity, have its periods 
of consummation. Here lies the force of the Plumb 
Plan, and no one knows this better than Mr. 
Gompers. The dilemma for the old man is that 
he has accepted a place in the middle of the stand- 
pat map. His place there, and his reason for ac- 
cepting it, are not forgotten by labor. They recog- 
nize that he deserves generous credit for having 
kept the trade unions alive during those black years 
of blind opposition and against the thunder of the 
employers that they would run their business to suit 



themselves. They know that the place Mr. 
Gompers holds is the sign that the standpatters were 
forced to acknowledge the existence of the unions. 
But in accepting a place among the standpatters, 
Mr. Gompers has had to straddle the fence and play 
up to the anticipatory desires of the exploiters bn 
each side. Neither Mr. Gompers nor any one else 
clearly saw until the war was over that the game of 
exploitation had about run its course; or those who 
anticipated it had no alternative mode of operating 
industry which would make an appeal of universal 
significance to the common people. As the Brother- 
hood plan for industrial reorganization is founded 
on the idea of ability and service it offers the oppor- 
tunity for functional satisfaction; it offers perhaps 
the first real sense of consummation in the long jour- 
ney of preparation. However, the reason that the 
men are rallying to. this plan as they have never 
rallied to the support of any other radical proposi- 
tion, is that the Brotherhoods are thoroughly organ- 
ized and are ready to name men competent to put 
the plan into effect. It is not necessary to remind 
Mr. Gompers of this last fact; he knows who will 
succeed him if the transition is made. And if at the 
conference which Mr. Wilson has called, Mr. 
Gompers decides to support the policy of the Presi- 
dent, let no labor man have any sentimental regrets 
about turning to new leadership. The desertion 
will not be labor's, but Mr. Gompers'. Mr. 
Gompers in his old age will have made the choice 
of old-age associates. And somewhere there will be 
found a comfortable place to which the two presi- 
dents can retire together, and together regale them- 
selves in a flow of never ending words. 

N O ONE CAN YET STATE POSITIVELY JUST WHAT 

canny Sammy will do but it is fairly certain that the 
new psychological elements in the industrial world 
will be too much for him, in the long run. He has 
never been strong, to be sure, in economics. Labor 
has been bought and sold under his nose during his 
full term of presidency and he will reiterate to the 
end that labor is not a commodity with a com- 
placent assurance equal to that of Mr. Wilson when 
he tells the American people that his imperialism is 
self-determination. As for psychology, Mr. Gompers 
has been conversant with one or two sets of reac- 
tions those which have to do with preparation and 
obstruction. He is entirely unfamiliar with the 
reaction of the consummatory process. When he 
backed Mr. Wilson's plan for breaking the railroad

strikes, he knew that with his endorsement Mr. Wil- 
son could call out the army and man the trains and 
break the strike without suffering from any ex- 
pression of resentment from the lesser officials of the 
trade unions. But the army is of no earthly use as 
an obstruction to the railroad reorganization plan 
of the Brotherhoods, for military maneuvres are 
without power to stem the new psychological 
processes which the plan has already released. The 
power of these processes to undermine obstructions 
and set creative forces free has been dramatically 
illustrated in the United States arsenals turned 
over at Captain Beyer's suggestion to the manage- 
ment of the workers. Experience in these plants 
is the best demonstration that could be had of the 
power of the Plumb Plan to set free, for creative 
activity, both ability and desire. When the arsenal 
reorganization plan was published in the press, the 
announcement was immediately followed by another 
reassuring business men who had taken fright that 
the old autocratic scheme of management was still 
actually in operation and that the managers 1 were 
simply playing with labor participation with the 
kind of participation, you know, that the Chambers 
of Commerce endorse. But if any one wants con- 
clusive proof that the participation at the arsenals is 
genuine it is only necessary to point to the fact that 
the arsenals now offer to make " optics " for the 
government at a cost of $20.74, against an outside 
bid from business of $55. The cry of alarm over the 
arsenal announcement was occasioned by the fear 
that the advantage of labor management over busi- 
ness imposture would be disclosed. 

NOT ONLY IS LABOR BECOMING INCREASINGLY 

conscious of the possibilities of labor participation 
in management, but business is realizing that the 
old wage incentive is losing its effect as a production 
drive. When a perfectly good manufacturer who 
has employed collective bargaining and used the 
union label for a generation wakes up to this fact, 
as one did the Either day, it is late indeed for union 
officials to ignore the change that is taking place 
among their own people. Especially late is it for 
the A. F. of L. Executive Council, when a closed 
shop manufacturer in the interests of his business 
passes from collective bargaining to contracting col- 
lectively with his workers, paying them union rates 
and dividing profits and costs under their direction 
and management. The collective contract with pri- 
vate owners cannot in the nature of the case have a 
long life because the workers under the collective 
contract will discover shortly that they are the quali- 
fied leaders of industry, and that the owners whose 
only qualification is ownership may just as well be 
sloughed off. And when labor discovers that it can 
sell the commodities it produces without selling 
itself, the laborers will be ready for a new unionism. 
Already they are feeling out, in some cases grop- 



ingly, in come cases intelligently, for new forms 
of organization. Whether or not twenty-three 
thousand ship's carpenters, on the Pacific coast, who 
have refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the 
A. F. of L. are ready to assume industrial respon- 
sibility, we do not know. But it is a matter of 
common knowledge that the leaders of the newly 
organized Amalgamated Textile Workers, recogniz- 
ing as they do that the responsibility for production 
must be assumed by the organized workers, have been 
able in six months to build up an organization of 
50,000 workers, skilled and unskilled, in ten cities 
including in all sixteen local unions. They are 
succeeding in a field where both the I. W. W. and 
the A. F. of L., stressing abstract rights or economic 
claims without assumption of responsibility, have 
so far failed. 

IN GERMANY THE ACID TEST OF THE RUSSIAN 
problem has been applied in full measure, and al- 
ready, in a society lately subjected to the solvent of 
war and revolution, the forms familiar to the his- 
toric past are crystallizing again. Domestic turmoil 
in Germany has temporarily obscured the differences 
between the bourgeois liberals and the Junker barons, 
but in the duality of Teutonic relationships with 
Russia the old antagonism has become as obvious 
as it ever was in the heyday of the spiked helmet. 
The Junkers, deprived now of the control of the 
German state, have found that they have much in 
common with certain sometime-subjects of the Tsar. 
In their eastward movement these Junker imperial- 
ists march not alone, but as the latest comers in a 
great historic procession. Charlemagne himself 
began the " drang nach Osten " ; in the later Middle 
Ages the Teutonic Knights carried the fear of the 
German name around the bend of the Baltic; Prus- 
sian kings and German emperors were the proud 
heirs of a policy of eastward expansion which 
found late expression in pre-war efforts to plant 
Teutonic farmers upon the soil of German Poland, 
and in the subsequent attempt to dominate Ukrainia 
and the whole of Great Russia. It is precisely this 
historic aspect of the Imperial Germany's Eastern 
policy that is now proving most disconcerting to 
the leaders of the Russian counter-revolution. The 
help of German Junkers against the Bolsheviki is 
indeed acceptable. And if reaction once gets the 
upper hand in Russia, men enough can be spared to 
give the Junkers a very respectable backing against 
the bourgeois government at Berlin. But will the 
Germans then consider themselves paid in full? Or 
will these kinsmen of the Teutonic barons of Lett- 
via and Esthonia claim the Baltic shore as the price 
of their friendship? Perhaps it is an affirmative 
answer to some such question as this that has 
prompted Kolchak to leave von der Goltz's Baltic 
army for the time being in the position of an unoffi- 
cial member of the Holy Alliance an active if not

an acknowledged partner of Britain, France, and 
America in the work of counter-revolution. And 
now, while we are making common cause with the 
militarists we so devoutly damned a few months 
ago, the German revolutionists who drove these 
same militarists out of the Fatherland are drifting 
farther and farther away from Allied paths on a 
Russian road of their own. The press dispatches 
that deal with the Russian comedy of errors refer 
freely to the Junkers and the other reactionaries 
now of our party as counter-revolutionists; and 
these same dispatches bring news of increasingly 
friendly relations between Social-Democratic Ger- 
many and Soviet Russia unequal partners in 
revolutionary progress. It is reported that Ger- 
man agents are establishing commercial connec- 
tions here and there in the Soviet Republic; 
and better yet it is even rumored that Ger- 
man goods are finding their way into Russia by 
devious routes through Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
and the Ukraine. This is the sort of peaceful com- 
mercial expansion that we recommended to Ger- 
many before the war. And now, despite our 
alliance with the German party that would be con- 
tent with nothing less than imperialist military ex- 
pansion, Germany is practicing what we preached. 
The only legitimate way to meet this trade competi- 
tion is to trade on our own account and to begin 
in a hurry before Germany actually succeeds in es- 
tablishing a monopoly of the Russian market. Per- 
haps our business men will see the wisdom of this 
course. If they do, we will have bourgeois Ger- 
many to thank for it that the blockade has been 
broken. If they do not, there is every hope that the 
German-Russian commercial alliance will become 
strong enough to protect the Soviet Republic from 
destruction by Allied, German, and Russian mili- 
tarism. Thus the German revolution, despised and 
incomplete, may yet be the means of saving Europe 
from a holocaust of reaction. 



1HE COMPLACENT AMPLITUDE OF THE WORDS 

" All-Russian " appropriated now by the forces 
of reaction must tempt the curious mind to impose 
a test of applicability; perhaps to ask just what pro- 
portion of Russia's humanity is politically " All- 
Russian " today. Now it is obviously impossible 
to answer this question so long as every party to the 
Russian controversy claims that by its own acquisi- 
tions of territory the inhabitants are delivered from 
a previous unwilling allegiance. However, with 
the aid of the latest census of Russia by provinces, 
supplemented by a wall map upon which current 
military information has been entered, it is possi- 
ble to arrive at a rough estimate of the strength of 
the populations now controlled by the several con- 
tending parties. According to the most recent es- 
timate of the Russian Central Statistical Committee 
(1915), the population of the Empire is more than 



1 82,000,000. Examining first the new nationalistic 
enterprises, we find that some eleven millions of 
people live within territories now occupied by 
Ukrainian troops; in view of the long history of 
Ukrainian nationalism, the unconfirmed report that 
this country has abandoned her independence as a 
condition of her alliance with Denikin is hardly to 
be credited. Poland claims sovereignty over the 
twelve million inhabitants of Russian Poland, and 
is attempting also to dominate the seven million 
people of Minsk and Volhynia provinces which 
have recently come within the sphere of Polish 
military operations. Farther north, the several Bal- 
tic states now control a territory inhabited by about 
twelve million people, distributed approximately as 
follows: Lithuania, 6,000,000; Lettvia (Livonia 
and Courland), 2,500,000; Esthonia, 500,000; Fin- 
land, 3,300,000. Thus the various small nations 
carved wholly or in part from the Empire actually 
control today about fourty-four million people 
not quite one-fourth of all the former subjects of 
the Czar. Coming now to deal with the popula- 
tions subject to Kolchak we find that the inhabitants 
of North Russia number about 1, 600,000, those of 
the Denikin area in South Russia 15,000,000, and 
those of Siberia 10,375,000; twenty-seven millions 
all told about one-seventh of the population of 
imperial Russia. There remain now several regions 
which are for the present of little military sig- 
nificance, as their inhabitants are taking no very 
definite or active part in the struggle for the mastery 
of Russia. These regions are nevertheless located 
behind the Kolchak lines and are presumably acces- 
sible to his forces: Cis-Caucasia, 5,700,000 in- 
habitants; Trans-Caucasia, 13,200,000; the Steppes, 
4,000,000; and Turkestan, 6,700,000. Finally it 
may be noted that Roumania has seized Bessarabia, 
thus eliminating the 2,700,000 inhabitants of this 
region from the Russian melange. Now if Kolchak 
is credited with a fairly active control of one-sev- 
enth of the population of Russia, and with the po- 
tential control of another sixth, the maximum popu- 
lation of " All-Russia " still stands at less than a 
third of the strength of the old Empire. The ad- 
dition, on the basis of an unconfirmed report, of 
the entire population of the area occupied by the 
Ukrainian armies raises the total to a little more 
than a third. If the evidence of these figures is 
accepted and if due weight is given to the reports 
of Bolshevist activities in Siberia and the Caucasus, 
to the historic dissonances of Roman Catholic, Greek 
Orthodox, Mohammedan, and Armenian religions, 
Tartar and Slavic stocks, tribal quarrels and na- 
tionalistic ambitions, there will be no further dif- 
ficulty in determining why it is that Kolchak, at 
the head of this hetrogeneous mob, can make no 
headway against the solid block of nearly eighty mil- 
lion people now united in the Soviet Republic 
the real All-Russia.

r REQUENTLY THE DEFEAT OF MILITARY TRAIN- 

ing in schools carries with it the defeat of all organ- 
ized physical training. So it is encouraging that the 
movement for physical education has received new 
momentum, and perhaps a new direction, from our 
wartime experience. Military statistics have dis- 
closed in vivid fashion the scale of our national de- 
ficiencies in health. At- the same time we have 
had an object lesson in the benefits of system- 
atic physical education from our training camps, 
which however clumsy and inappropriate theii 
methods, and however baneful their effect on indi- 
vidual initiative and responsibility have, on the 
whole, converted the flabby in health into the ro- 
bust, and the lackadaisical in spirits into the exu- 
berant. The proponents of universal military train- 
ing base much of their plea upon this physical trans- 
formation. If it can be secured to our youth through 
other means, we shall hear less about the supposed 
advantages of that regimen in terms of obedience 
to authority and the like. To secure it through 
compulsory measures in the public schools, the 
Playground and Recreation Association of America 
has established a national Physical Education Serv- 
ice to spread information and stimulate legislation. 
The Service does not put forward compulsory phys- 
ical training as quite the millennial panacea that the 
militarists profess universaj. military training to be. 
They mention " good housing, good food, and sane 
regulation of juvenile labor " as " equally neces- 
sary " to the production of a sound citizenry ; but 
they hold that a proper physical education will 
stimulate the development of these corollary agen- 
cies. By proper physical education they seem to 
mean and here appears what promises the new 
direction in the movement something more than 
perfunctory setting-up exercises and irrelevant imi- 
tations of the manual of arms. They talk about 
" individual physical examinations at sufficiently 
close intervals to secure an accurate record of the 
child's development " and about " provision for the 
correction of deficient bodily conditions that impair 
health." They cite new French legislation that 
inaugurates outdoor colonies for physically defective 
children, reorganizes the school medical inspection 
systems, and aims at simplification of curricula, 
" which are frightfully overloaded and tend to de- 
stroy energy." They report the reorganization of 
the English educational system to admit compulsory 
training and athletics between the ages of six and 
eighteen, with special provision for physical exami- 
nation, for the treatment of mental and physical 
defectives, and for the establishing of baths and 
swimming pools. In short, their discussion en- 
visages measures at once preventive and corrective. 
But it should be obvious, even to the state 
legislature, that measures which will prevent and 
correct such conditions must be very different 
from the routine " physiology " and impersonal 



" drills " at present inflicted on our already over- 
driven school children. Once more the American 
educational establishment has an opportunity, and 
the assistance of European models, to provide a 
humane system that will discriminate between indi- 
viduals and work flexibly to attain its ends. If once 
more we succumb to our national vice of standard- 
ization and merely erect an additional machine to 
which -pupils must adapt themselves or be broken, 
we shall only be worse off than before war showed 
us how badly off we were. 

IF THE WIVES OF STATESMEN', BEFRIENDED BY THE 

Carnegie annuity, have any knowledge of the work- 
ings of the Carnegie Pension System for the ad- 
vancement of teaching they will not accept the be- 
quest until they look their gift-horse rather carefully 
in the mouth. Professor J. McKeen Cattell's essay 
on Carnegie Pensions (Science Press; New York) 
supplemented by extracts from 214 academic letters, 
contains words of prudent counsel for those who 
habitually forget the destination of the road paved 
with good intentions. Mr. Carnegie's ten million 
dollar foundation seemed an imposing bequest at 
the beginning. But as soon as the foundation 
started to operate its retirement benefit plan, 
it found itself in the distresing situation made mem- 
orable by the bookkeeping of Mr. Micawber, its 
outlay proved greater than its income, and since 
that time the officers of the foundation have trimmed 
the sails of their educational policy continually and 
have sought to hide their own lugubrious lack of 
financial foresight by animadversions on the defects 
of free pensions upon human nature, in a manner not 
calculated to "encourage, uphold, and dignify the 
cause of higher education." (As a matter of fact, 
the foundation at length became insolvent in all but 
legal status, and was forced to apply to the Carnegie 
Trust for further financial relief.) From year to 
year the purpose of the Fund has been shifted and 
twisted. At first it was a reward for g^ood work and 
an incitement to scholarship, then a relief of disa- 
bility, and now in its final form it has lost all tincture 
of the founder's brilliant philanthropy, and has be- 
come a shabby mechanism whereby the Butlers and 
Pritchetts of the educational world may bully their 
colleagues into orthodoxy and propriety. The 
new pension system is a simple life insurance 
scheme, compulsory to every member of the 
teaching staff of the university that accepts it. It 
is at last a sound business proposition perhaps, but 
in that case it offers no greater satisfaction than 
regular commercial insurance, and the college 
teacher has a sense of being cheated by a promise 
unfulfilled without being benefited by the offer of 
a substitute. A centralized, compulsory pension 
system has dangerous possibilities of limiting 
academic freedom, and while a system of insurance 
on this basis may rob death of its sting it may equally 
well rob life of its virtue.

T HE AVERAGE NEWSPAPER OFFICE STILL REMAINS 

a stronghold of cynicism when it comes to " colleges 
of journalism." Despite the best intentions in the 
world, the embryo newspaperman displaying a uni- 
versity label is apt to find that his credentials win 
him nothing but a skeptical smile. He may be a 
good reporter, but it remains to be proved that is 
the usual attitude of the veterans of the " city 
room." His successes are heavily discounted. 
And the worst of it is that the prevailing attitude 
of doubt has a considerable basis in fact, and un- 
doubtedly will continue to have so long as pro- 
fessors of journalism are recruited from the ranks of 
editorial wool-gatherers instead of reportorial news- 
gatherers. Our colleges and universities have fallen 
into the practice of filling their professorships with 
out-dated newspapermen capable by the old 
standards and traditions, but more or less com- 
pletely out of tune with the aggressive, resourceful 
methods which prevail in metropolitan offices. These 
men, who have gradually slackened pace and 
dropped into editorial chairs, are naturally attracted 
to an opportunity to teach. In many instances, the 
call comes from their own alma mater. They are 
partially reabsorbed in the college atmosphere, and 
unconsciously they drift further and further from 
the mad current of the daily press. They teach 
journalism out of the fullness of their textbooks. 
Engrossed in vague reminiscent aspects of " news- 
paper ethics," they sometimes lose their grip on the 
common or garden variety, of newspaper ethics 
the ethics of " sticking to the sheet," the ethics which 
may allow you to damn your paper verbally, but 
which makes you work like a Trojan to beat the 
other fellow to the news, doggedly determined not 
to " fall down," or what is far more odious 
" lie down " on a story. No real reporter, raised 
from a cub, would ever try to justify himself if he 
did what one professor of journalism did recently, 
while " filling in " during the summer months on a 
metropolitan daily. On the night of a primary elec- 
tion, he was assigned to the board of elections with 
instructions to telephone the returns at half-hourly 
intervals. Now there is an 'unwritten law in the 
newspaper world that everybody works election 
nights, regardless of whether he has been on duty 
during the day or not. However, around .eleven 
o'clock that evening, returns from the board of 
election suddenly ceased, and inquiry developed 
the fact that the professor had " left a long 
time ago." A telephone call to his residence 
revealed that he had gone to bed. A brief con- 
versation, in which the professor affirmed that 
he " wasn't going to work day and night for any- 
one " and asked "what did they take him for?" 
brought the hot retort that he was " fired." When 
the professor revises his admirable textbook on jour- 
nalism one wonders what use if any he will 
make of this episode. Might it not serve as the text 
for a new chapter, to be called, Ethics Versus Eight 
Hours' Sleep? 



1 HERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE NATURAL SCIENCES 

were everywhere hampered by the type of religious 
prejudice that brands as heresy any interpretation 
of new data that runs contrary to the pre-established 
dogmas of orthodoxy. Today, however, scientific 
discussion of worlds-from-star-dust and man-from- 
the-amoeba arouse no more than the echoed thunder 
of an old resentment. It is not to be supposed on 
this account that human sentiments and emotions 
are no longer sensitive to the scientific challenge. 
What has really happened is this: the feelings 
that formerly clung to the church are now in 
large measure clustered about two other sacro- 
sanct institutions private property, and the national 
state. In consequence, while the biologists go their 
way in peace, the social scientists are menaced with 
all the hallowed spooks that did service when man 
was in the first agonies of accepting the monkey. 
It just happens that by some perversity of fate 
the last five years have brought forth a mass of eco- 
nomic and political data that demands analysis, and 
have at the same time produced a psychological com- 
plex that makes a scientific handling of this material 
well nigh impossible. The serviceability of political 
nationalism has been pretty severely tested by the 
war. Some men dared to question the theory 
of private property. Partisanship runs high, and 
science groans under the double strain of super- 
abundant material and constricting emotions. 
Science but not always the scientist to use the 
term most loosely. Charles Downer Hazen, for 
instance, comes joyously to the task of defending 
man against the monkey. His Fifty Years of 
Europe (Holt) offers fifteen chapters of tolerably 
unbiased history, written before the war when it 
wasn't very hard to be unbiased; as a preface to one 
chapter of excited propaganda finished on armistice 
day, when cool heads were few and precious. If 
Mr. Hazen had waited till the Allies got through 
with Germany, he might have been willing to drop 
some of the adjectives we find attached to the Teu- 
ton name ; of course he would not in any case have 
considered placing these colorful modifiers to the 
discredit of any other nation. His arraignment of 
the Bolsheviki will probably be accepted as authori- 
tative for some weeks to come.

THE STRUGGLE OF STRUGGLING RUSSIA 

SIR: Kolchak's chief press agent in this country 
is hurt by my last articles on Russia. He has under- 
taken a series of personal attacks on me in the pages 
of Struggling Russia. My literary and revolution- 
ary record gives me the right and carries with it an 
obligation to write all that I know on Russia, but 
at the same time does not require me to answer 
aspersions of personal character from hired agents. 

I am glad only that the facts which I referred 
to are " repudiated " in a very peculiar manner. 
Let us give a few examples, since it would be im- 
possible to analyze Mr. Sack's prolix articles in 
entirety. 

1. Struggling Russia writes (August 23, 1919) : 

Bashkkov is the accredited representative in this coun- 
try of the Siberian Union of Creamery Societies and had 
every right and reason to sign the pro-Kolchak proclama- 
tion. 

I wrote and I repeat again: Bashkirov is not a 
cooperative man, he was never elected regularly and 
is therefore not a lawful representative. 

2. Struggling Russia denies that the Allies are 
the main support of the Russian " loyal " Govern- 
ments. 

Even the New York Times reports that the 
British fleet bombards Russian cities and Mr. Sack 
is net aware of it! 

3. The editor of Kolchak's magazine does not 
answer at all to my statement that the " high com- 
missioner of the Omsk Government " in Washing- 
ton, Mr. Okoulich, was expelled by the representa- 
tives of the Russian Cooperatives from London, be- 
cause of his close connections with British capitalists 
who aimed economically to colonize Russia. 

4. Struggling Russia keeps silent about the 
pogromist Platon. Twice (in the New Republic 
and in THE DIAL) Platon was denounced and I 
asked why Mr. Sack is putting Jewish leaders in 
touch with a pogromist of the Czar? No answer 
followed. Only after the Nation wrote openly that 
that fact is known in some circles, Mr. Sack an- 

' swered : " Metropolitan Platon does not need our 
defense" (sic) and further: "Prominent repre- 
sentatives of the American Jewry visited him to 
express to him their sympathy." I emphasize that 
these lines were written by Mr. Sack only after he 
was compelled to do so by the American liberal 
press and he still tries to convince the Jewish leaders 
that Platon is a democrat and then shows his reader 
that Platon is a democrat because the Jewish lead- 
ers came to his house. They did not come, they 
were deceived and brought by. Mr. Sack. 

5. Struggling Russia asserts that there is in 
stenographic reports of the third Duma a statement 
in favor of Platon " which never was repudiated." 
I could not find anything of this nature in the 
stenographic reports, but suppose for the moment it 
is true! So much the worse, because Mr. Sack 



again deceives the American public, since the third 
Duma is known as the pogrom and reactionary 
Duma. The few liberals who were there were help- 
less before the forces of the black majority. The 
same Duma adopted a resolution (after a motion 
of Bishop Mitrophan) in which the liberals were 
called criminals and in which the Duma protested 
against calling the Czar only monarch, and left him 
die name of " Czar and Autocrat of All-Russia," 
whose power comes from God and cannot be re- 
stricted by any institution. (See stenographic report 
of the session of November 13, 1907). The third 
Duma was guilty in the famous white terror and 
the shameful process of Beiliss, whose main organ- 
izer, Lamislovsky, was the leader of the Pogrom and 
Octobrist majority of the third Duma and who 
worked in May 1907 with Platon and others near 
the Czar in their plot against the Duma itself. 
Struggling Russia began with Breshkovsky : I wrote 
then that Sack was abusing a great name. Now it is 
evident. He defends the pogrom makers, the 
Czarist people, the Black Hundred, here in this 
country. It is easy to infer what his chiefs are doing 
in Siberia. 

With these lines I finish my answer and will not 
reply any more to Mr. Sack because I cannot reply 
to a man who speaks democracy and shakes Platen's

AN OPEN LETTER ON MEXICO 

SIR: Mexico, on declaring her independence of 
the motherland, established a republican govern- 
ment and was unfortunately betrayed by her ad- 
miration of this country into the adoption of a fed- 
eral system, for which no foundation had been laid 
in her previous history. From this cause, added to 
her inexperience in self government and to the want 
of intelligence among the mass of her population, 
her institutions have yielded very imperfectly the 
fruits of freedom. The country has been rent by 
factions, the capitol convulsed by revolutions, and 
the chief office of the state been secured by the 
military to popular chieftains. 

The emigrants from this country (the United 
States) . . . went with open eyes, with full 
knowledge of the unsettled state of affairs, into this 
region of misrule and agitation. 

That they were not always wisely governed, that 
their rights were not always respected, who can 
doubt? What else could be expected? Mexico is 
not wise. Mexico is not skilled in the science of 
human rights. Her civilization is very imperfect, 
as we . . . have always known, and a good 
government is one of the slowest fruits of civiliza- 
tion. In truth a good government exists nowhere. 
The errors and vices of rulers entail on every state. 

Nothing is easier than for any and every people 
to draw up a list of wrongs; nothing more ruinous 
than to rebel because every claim is not treated with.

respect. A colony emigrating from a highly civilized 
country has no right to expect in a less favored state 
the privileges it has left behind. 

. . . (They) must have been insane if on 
entering Mexico they looked for an administration 
as faultless as that under which they lived. They 
might with equal reason have planted themselves 
in Russia, and then have unfurled the banner of 
independence near the throne of the Czar, because 
denied the immunities of their native land. 

I now proceed to consider the real and great 
causes of the revolt. 

The first great cause was the unbounded unprin- 
cipled spirit of land speculation. To show the scale 
on which this kind of plunder has been carried on, 
it may be stated that the legislature of Coahuila 
. . . in open violation of the laws of Mexico 
were induced " by a company of land speculators, 
never distinctly known, to grant them, in considera- 
tion of twenty thousand dollars, the extent of five 
hundred square leagues of the public land." This 
transaction was disavowed and the grant annulled 
by the Mexican government. 

Great numbers in this country have nominal 
titles to land, which can only be substantiated by 
setting aside the authority of the General Congress 
of Mexico, and are, of consequence directly and 
^trongly interested in severing this province from 
the Mexican Confederacy. 

They looked abroad, and to whom did they look? 
To any foreign state? To the government under 
which they had formerly lived ? No ; their whole 
reliance was placed on selfish individuals in a neigh- 
boring republic at peace with Mexico. 

Modern times furnish no example of individual 
rapine on so large a scale. It is nothing less than 
the robbery of a realm. The pirate seizes a ship. 
The colonists and their coadjutors can satisfy them- 
selves with nothing short of an empire. They have 
left their Anglo-Saxon ancestors behind them. It is 
from a well ordered, enlightened Christian country 
that hordes have gone forth, in open day, to per- 
petrate this mighty wrong. 

Does it consist with national honor, with national 
virtue, to receive to our embrace men who have 
prospered by crimes which we were bound to repro- 
bate and repress? 

The United States have not been just to Mexico. 
Our citizens did not steal singly, silently, in dis- 
guise, into that land. Their purpose of dismember- 
ing Mexico and attaching her distant province to 
this country was not wrapt in mystery. It was pro- 
claimed in our public prints. The government, 
indeed, issued its proclamation, forbidding these 
hostile preparations, but this was a dead letter. 

Are we willing to take our place among robber- 
states? As a people, have we no self-respect? Have 
we no reverence for national morality? Have we 
no feeling of responsibility to other nations and to 
Him by whom the fates of nations are disposed?

RECONSTRUCTING THE CLASSICS 

SIR: The interesting article by Royal Case 
Nemiah in your Spring Educational Number seemed 
to me to be less an argument for the reconstruction of 
the classics than for courses in comparative literature. 
Indeed, such schools as the University of Wisconsin 
in its department of comparative literature and the 
University of Texas in its school of general litera- 
ture are offering precisely the course in epic poetry 
which Mr. Nemiah unwittingly outlined. 

Mr. Nemiah bases his reform upon the 1 high 
school. " In the secondary schools the main object 
must always be mastery of the formal and syntactical 
elements of the language..." he writes, but he 
adds " inasmuch as this discussion has to do with 
university problems it is permissible to pass over 
those which have to do with elementary instruction." 
This is precisely what is the matter with the classics. 
High school students who have to devote themselves 
to grubbing out Latin verbs are not likely to develop 
a passion for Virgil. It is at least instructive to 
imagine what would happen if the high schools 
should read the classics in translation; postponing 
the mastery of the formal and syntactical elements 
of the language until the students have had an op- 
portunity to see the forest without being perpetual- 
ly troubled by the trees. 

Mr. Nemiah seems to argue that a knowledge 
of the language is necessary to an appreciation of 
the literature of Greece and Rome. I hesitate to 
thresh old straw; but we have respectable authority 
for translation. Emerson, it will be* recalled, pre- 
ferred to read his classics in English, that broad sea 
which receives all rivers in its bosom; and Keats, 
the most purely Greek of all our poets, could not 
read the tongue of Homer. We do lose in transla- 
tion; the question is how much can we afford to 
lose ? Here we may make a distinction. Lyric poetry- 
is, for instance, too intimately bound up with the 
genius of the language to be readily translatable. 
The sorry " translations " of Heine are evidence of 
the immalleability of his Lieder. But with epic 
poetry and drama the loss is less; and with prose 
it reduces itself to a minimal quantity. The study 
of general literature proceeds upon the pragmatic 
theory that it is better to have read Homer in Eng- 
lish than not to have read him at all. I confess 
that for the general student this seems to me to be 
the wise attitude. 

In short, I trust that university reconstruction 
will involve an increasing importance for the study 
of comparative literature. The students should be 
linguistically equipped if they can be; but if they 
must read translations, let them read the best rather 
than not read at all. I confess that the sunset 
stealing over Greek and Latin seems to me ineluct- 
able; we cannot, like Joshua, bid the luminary 
stand still; and this being the case, we need courses 
in general literature as the next best substitute.

Notes on New Books 

FRENCH EDUCATIONAL IDEALS OF TODAY. 
Edited by Ferdinand Buisson and Frederic 
Ernest Farrington. 326 pages. World Book 
Co., Yonkers-on-Hudson. 

Here is a volume on 'education that contributes 
nothing to the discussion of the comparative values 
of basket weaving and the three R's, football and 
calisthenics, stenography and the Gallic War. 
Rather it shows the French Republic face to face 
with a problem the existence of which has hardly 
been acknowledged in America the problem of 
moral education. In America public education pro- 
ceeds for the most part on the comfortable assump- 
tion that the Church still looks after this sort of 
thing. France can nurse no such delusion. The re- 
lation of the Republic with the Church is not one 
of casual indifference but of positive enmity. The 
Revolutionary tradition of human dignity, the free- 
dom of the will, and the rights of man prepared 
France to dispense with the spiritual counsel of the 
Church, but on no account could moral education 
be allowed to remain in the hands of an institution 
thus alienated from the State. Spiritually the chil- 
dren of France might be Catholics if it so pleased 
them ; morally they must be citizens of the Republic. 
" Since the Revolution," says Gabriel Seailles, one 
of the contributors to the volume under considera- 
tion, "national unity no longer rests upon sectarian 
unity, and this implies that civil society finds in 
itself, in its awn conscience, if I may use the word, 
the principles which permit it to organize and to 
maintain its'elf . . . Society is capable of 
giving and is obliged to give its members an edu- 
cation whose elements are based upon its own re- 
quirements and its own aspirations." It is with 
the profound problems created by this situation that 
Julus Ferry, Ernest Lavisse, Jean Jauras, Georges 
Clemenceau, Ferdinand Buisson, Emile Durckheim, 
and most of the other contributors to this anthology 
of French educational thought are chiefly concerned. 
One does not attempt to brief the contributions to 
such a discussion. One recommends simply in all 
earnestness that they be read. 

THE ENGLISH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. By 
A. W.. Newton. 299 pages. Longmans, Green. 
COMPARATIVE EDUCATION. Edited by Peter 
Sandiford. 500 pages. Button. 

The English Elementary School is an informative 
book. Its author, as inspector of schools, has had 
the opportunity to gather the materials for a com- 
plete educational Baedeker, a cross between a his- 
tory and a guidebook. Types of schools, the makeup 
of school boards, the appointment of teachers, and 
the methods of finance in short, the administrative 
side of the school is what occupies Mr. Newton's 
attention. The broader aspects of his subject the 
author does not touch upon. Nevertheless there 



are points of immediate American interest. The 
New York school teacher will note with satisfaction, 
for example, that the system of ratings which ties 
them hand and foot was discarded in England many 
years ago. The freedom of the English school unit 
becomes evident, again, in the examination of various 
national school systems brought together under the 
editorial direction of Mr. Sandiford. English 
teachers, it appears, suffer less external control than 
those of any other nation, and there is plenty of 
elbow room for experiment and local adaptation. 
But England is still at heart aristocratic, or at least 
oligarchic, and the school system also has followed 
caste distinctions, a dividing line being drawn be- 
tween the " public " schools and the traditional 
Public Schools. For democratic practice the ex- 
ample of Denmark is most pregnant, an example 
not sufficiently taken to heart in our rural regions. 
The Danish folk high school has turned depressed 
country louts into intelligent cooperative farmers, 
and has checked the drift from the land to the cities 
by offering the farm workers the cultural advantages 
of citizenship. The Danish school system does not 
stop at an artificially determined " school age " : 
it is a meeting place for the entire adult community, 
and it provides an atmosphere of song, gymnastics, 
and play which surrounds all the " practical " 
work of instruction. 



LETTERS TO TEACHERS. By Hartley Burr 
Alexander. 253 pages. Open Court; Chicago. 
PROBLEMS OF THE SECONDARY TEACHER. By 
William Jerusalem. Translated by Charles F. 
Sanders. 253 pages. Badger, Boston. 

Both Professor Alexander and Professor Jerusa- 
lem are philosophers and humanists, and they are 
both concerned with the methods and aims of teach- 
ing. But at this point their similarity ends; for 
educational tradition in Nebraska is still in the mak- 
ing, and Professor Alexander is concerned that 
it should be formed in the spirit of liberalism and 
the humanities, while in Vienna education is stiff 
with the precepts and the precedents of the drill- 
master and the administrator, and Professor Jeru- 
salem's suggestions at their most daring pitch only 
hint how 'the weight of the burden may be borne 
with a little better grace. If the teacher wishes an 
insight into the workings of the German educational 
system, as it impinges itself on a mind that has 
sought freedom within its limits, Professor Jerusa- 
lem's text will serve admirably; but if he seeks 
inspiration and criticism and personal suggestion for 
dealing with his own day-to-day problems he will 
find that Letters to Teachers is a book to be placed 
on the same shelf as those Talks to Teachers 1 whose 
place in the literature of education is now well-nigh 
hallowed.- Professor Alexander is concerned to com- 
bat the spirit of regimentation, of administrative 
centralization, of an illiberal curriculum, of stand- 
ardization, of servility to texts and methods, in short

of the dangers that threaten every good institution 
when the forms dominate the spirit and subdue it. 
Those who talk glibly of a National System of 
Education would do well to ponder Professor Alex- 
ander's criticism. Is the gain of a universal stand- 
ard throughout the nation worth the risk of empha- 
sizing system to the neglect of education? A glance 
at Professor Jerusalem's book should confirm the 
negative reply! 

NEW SCHOOLS FOR OLD. By Evelyn Dewey. 
337 pages. Dutton. 

Miss Dewey tells a story of a remarkable revolu- 
tion which was accomplished in a farming district 
in Missouri. The heroine of the story is the teacher 
of the little district school. Mrs. Harvey went to 
the school with a plot but no plans. While a 
teacher in the Kirkwell Normal School she had 
come to understand why the school failed to in- 
terest the pupils although it had introduced a 
curriculum consonant with modern school practice 
and related to rural life. The trouble with this 
school was that it treated rural life in the abstract 
and passed by the actual problems of the particular 
community for which the school was established. 
Mrs. Harvey went to the Porter School with the 
determination to discover what the problems of the 
district were. The second spring after her arrival 
the blister beetle appeared. The school, with the 
advice of farm bulletins, helped in the extermina- 
tion of the beetles. After an investigation of the 
best preventive measures in use the school took the 
lead in heading off the hog cholera. Mrs. Harvey 
did not enter the district as a disciple of scientific 
agriculture, but the result of her entry was that the 
practice of the community in dealing with its prob- 
lems was supported by the scientific technique which 
the school introduced. The problems were no 
longer isolated personal affairs but matters of gen- 
eral interest, and because of this they received all 
the time and attention which their solution required. 
There is no graduation day at the Porter School, 
as there is no separation between school and com- 
munity interests. And what is final proof for the 
farmers that Mrs. Harvey had wrought a revolu- 
tion is that the young people for the most part 
remain in the district. Miss Dewey 's story pot- 
trays a succession of developments which are rich 
and stimulating in suggestion for all people who 
are interested in education, problems of coopera- 
tive effort, and rural life. 



THE COLLEGES IN WAR TIME AND AFTER. 
By Parke Rexford Kolbe. 320 pages. 
Appleton. 

Dr. Kolbe, as a special collaborator in the United 
States Bureau of Education, is well qualified to 
compile statistics on collegiate participation in the 
nation's war program. His book, one of the 



Wickware series on problems of war and recon- 
struction, shows the marks of extensive inquiry and 
investigation, and represents the accumulation of 
many pertinent figures and facts. Although one 
cannot always accept his deductions without a grain 
of salt, yet one must be grateful to him for the mate- 
rial which he presents. The book does not propose 
to be a scientific consideration of reconstruction 
problems for the colleges and universities of Amer- 
ica. It is simply a record of their unanimous 
response to the call of war, of the adjustments which 
they were sometimes eager and sometimes com- 
pelled to make, and of their almost universal suc- 
cess in maintaining themselves through the trials 
and difficulties of a dangerous period. It is true 
that Dr. Kolbe occasionally theorizes concerning . 
significant problems of higher education which the 
war has poked out of a somewhat dormant state of 
discussion, but his main purpose is not the solution 
of these, only their presentation. He forecasts a 
growing nationalization of the universities, the four- 
quarter plan of curriculum, a well -justified increase 
in the pay of college instructors, new intensive train- 
ing courses modeled 'after the Army and Navy types, 
the substitution of Spanish and French for German, 
a great demand for college-trained women, and a 
rapid popularization and democratization of all 
institutes of higher learning. He advocates a Sec- 
retary of Education to have a place in the Presi- 
dent's cabinet, an acceptance of some kind of mili- 
tary training, an Intercollegiate Intelligence Bureau 
for the proper placement of college products, and 
the liberal expenditure of government funds in the 
promotion of college research for the public good. 
Nor does he forget to say, " It should be the solemn 
duty of the colleges to encourage classical study in 
every possible way in the years to come, so that its 
humanizing influence may not be entirely lost to 
our modern civilization." 

It is readily seen that he has nothing new to 
offer. His most startling recommendation is the 
establishment of a constitutional Department of 
Education, which has been discussed and advocated 
for many months by the N.E.A., the Bureau of 
Education, and other pedagogic institutions. He 
is much too kind to be acceptably honest. He 
camouflages the practical failure of the S.A.T.C. 
with a thick coat of gentle apologies and good- 
hearted explanations; yet it was that very S.A.T.C. 
system which laid such a heavy burden of financial 
loss and internal adjustment on the colleges and 
universities of the country that it almost broke the 
backs of many. His record, however, is built in 
general on undeniably accurate information, since 
it comes from the institutions themselves, and his 
appendices present a complete list of all military 
units authorized, the regulations and curricula of 
both R.O.T.C. and S.A.T.C., and important data 
on the actual war contribution of six large repre- 
sentative universities.

THE MENTAL HYGIENE OF CHILDHOOD. By 
William A. White. 193 pages. Little, 
Brown; Boston. 

THE CHILD'S UNCONSCIOUS MIND. The 
Relations of Psychoanalysis to Education. By 
Wilfred Lay. 325 pages. Dodd, Mead. 

The reader of this book feels that Dr. White's 
experience with children and adults who have failed 
from difficulties in mental adjustment must be of 
great value for those who have to do with children 
who may yet be saved from failure. Unfortunately 
the message is not presented in a manner that will 
reach the very people who have greatest need for it ; 
namely, the masses of parents without technical 
training, or without special ability in translating 
concentrated abstractions into practical conduct. Dr. 
White emphasizes the sexual elements in the child's 
impulses, and the normal antagonisms between 
parents and children two sets of forces that have 
been obscured by convention but that continue to 
do their work in spite of society's disregard of them. 
The chapter on The Family Situation is excellent, 
and if the reader started with this one, much of the 
earlier part would be more intelligible. It is to be 
hoped that Dr. White will write another book that 
will make his substantial contribution to this field 
more generally available. 

We are in great need of books that will effectively 
introduce teachers and parents to the subject of 
the child's unconscious mind. As in all other de- 
partments of thought and education, the ordinary 
classroom teacher is a generation behind the in- 
vestigations that should furnish the essentials of his 
method and his subject matter; and anything that 
will bring the school's procedure and the results 
of research a little closer together deserves hearty 
commendation and encouragement. The person who 
has not yet had his first introduction to the modern 
analytical psychology will hardly find in Dr. Lay's 
book the means for overcoming the usual prejudices 
and resistances, although the presentation t is here 
much simpler than he is likely to find elsewhere in 
an English treatise. From a pedagogical view- 
point the work is very uneven. The treatment of 
introjection, for example, is lucid and helpful; the 
treatment of rationalization, which has such great 
possibilities for the teacher, and the treatment of 
the partial trends, are far from satisfactory. The 
author sees social and educational possibilities in 
exhibitionism; but sees only tendencies to repress in 
the others. He has a real appreciation of ambiv- 
alence; but unless the reader already understands 
what to do about it, this book will hardly help him. 

Dr. Lay rightly emphasizes the need for bringing 
the work of the classroom closer to the realities of 
the outside world; the school is still too much a 
cloister. But his own suggestions of reality strike, 
one as verging on the academic, to say the least. 
His introduction of the spelling bee method as a 
means of getting immediate rewards and punish- 



ments for training for adult life is characteristic of 
his interpretation of realities. Thus, he emphasizes 
the importance of giving special consideration to the 
exceptional children who are the seeds of the future's 
progress (children who are not going to be helped 
if the ordinary teacher learns that they are called 
" neurotics ") ; yet he insists that the efforts of the 
teacher be directed toward fitting the children to 
living in the late-Victorian era of commercial com- 
petition. Again, he attributes the low efficiency of 
industrial workers not trained in modern scientific 
standardized motions to the " unconscious wish " to 
keep down production. Here the author uncon- 
sciously tells us what newspapers he reads. 

But Dr. Lay has written the first book we have 
in this field, and we shall have to use it until a 
better one comes along. 

APPLIED EUGENICS. By Paul Popenoe and 
Roswell Hill Johnson. 459 pages. Macmillan. 

This book on eugenics has all the weight of ex- 
ternal authority, because it is written by Paul 
Popenoe, the editor of the Journal of the American 
Genetics Association, and Prof. Roswell Hill John- 
son of the University of Pittsburgh, in such skilful 
collaboration that it is hard to tell where one begins 
and the other leaves off. Unfortunately it tries to 
preserve an even balance between the followers of 
Mendelian research and the biometric school of Karl 
Pearson, and in so doing it inevitably does injustice 
to those who believe that heredity is a matter of 
biology and not of logarithms. It is true that ex- 
treme statements of the Mendelian school need 
modification, and the terminology of this new 
method needs clarification, but the hope of students 
of heredity lies in this approach to the problem. In 
The Progress of Eugenics, published in 1910, Pro- 
fessor Caleb W. Saleeby said of the Eugenics 
Records Office that it " has applied the principles 
of a new department of knowledge to the. study of 
human heredity and has added more to our exact 
knoivledge of that fundamental subject, in the last 
four years than all preceding time could record." 
A prophet is not without honor save in his own 
country, and the authors make only two slighting 
references to the Eugenics Records Office. There 
is no summary of the Mendelian law, although it 
should be explained for the benefit of the lay reader; 
yet there are several plates and diagrams to 
illustrate the Pearsonian doctrine, although they 
would be better fitted for a textbook on mathe- 
matics. 

While it is disappointing to find such lack of 
perspective in the chapters which deal with the 
theoretic aspects of eugenics, the rest of the book, 
covers the ground very thoroughly, and contains 
much new matter. The Kallikak family and the 
Jukes are given somewhat of a rest, which must 
ease them of the burden of being the stock example 
of eugenics. There is ultimately discussion of segre-

gation, sterilization, and other social remedies for 
defective germplasm, and the authors discuss Social- 
ism, Prohibition, the Single Tax, Religion, and 
several other social themes, clearly but rather arbi- 
trarily with reference to their bearing on the 
eugenic problem. 

THE STARLING. By Juliet Wilbor Tompkins. 
267 pages. Bobbs-Merrill. 

There is no novelty in the theme of The Starling 
the pathetic repressions which may be inflicted by 
home environment upon a child but the author 
has handled, it with such insight and such artistry 
that it seems almost new. The central character, 
that of the daughter of a professor who wraps his 
sensitive feelmgs in the mantle of a domestic martyr 
in lieu of some more human dressing-gown, is 
sketched with deft strokes and with a freedom from 
mawkish exaggeration. One is permitted to watch 
the development of character with a certain detach- 
ment, but with the sympathies constantly alert. In 
a word, the author's pen has kept pace with the 
story without prodding it. The most successful por- 
tion of the book is the earlier chapters, in which the 
child reacts most keenly to the cramping personality 
of a father who must not be disturbed and whose 
wishes are mandates of isolation. These pages are 
marked by imagination and restraint. Toward the 
close of the story, the author falls into well-worn 
grooves of conformity, and the love interest is ren- 
dered in the conventional molds. The style, with 
its undercurrent of tolerant humor, is smoothly 
adapted to the narrative. 

OXFORD POETRY, 1918. Edited by T.W.E., 
E.F.A.G., and D.L.S. 55 pages. Longmans, 
Green. 

It is a curious gift of the English, a part of their 
literary tradition that their merest balderdash is 
written with a style that Americans are content to 
admire without being able to imitate. One has but 
to compare the output of Oxford with the stuff pub- 
lished in various American counterparts of this 
university anthology to find in the former a quality 
of its own. In the latest annual, however, this 
quality is strained to its thinnest. The verse is 
unhappily literary, full of those echoes common to 
youth, and of the mild clamor over love and death 
incident to the same season. It is the more dis- 
appointing partly because one expects more from 
the youth of England, partly because previous years 
have made a better showing. The war, which must 
have shaken Oxford deeply, seems hardly to have 
touched her vocal men. Even Robert Nichols is 
represented by such a stale, if technically careful, 
piece of writing as Closing Lines from " Poly- 
phemus His Passion " : A Pastoral. The poem is 
much like its title. T. W. Earp, whom one has 
learned to look for, retreats to the cloister in some 



pretty lines addressed to Our Lady of Light. One 
sonnet is sufficiently occasional to prick interest: it 
is called The Journalist, and denounces the unnamed 
Northcliffe as one who " forged a chain to lead the 
people by " and " pulled the strings that shook their 
statesmen down." Margaret Leigh, who is its 
author, made similar angry stabs at a diplomat and 
a , profiteer, respectively, which can hardly hurt 
them, since the poems are epitaphs. Nor are they 
the sort that echo in dead men's ears. The two 
things worth consideration are a poem on a praying 
idiot, by L. A. G. Strong, which is simple and vivid ; 
and the evocative, if not completely successful.

YEARS AFTER. By Ralph Adams Cram. 68 
pages. Marshall Jones, Boston. 

THE SINS OF THE FATHERS. By Ralph 
Adams Cram. 114 pages. Marshall Jones, 
Boston. 

If you build Gothic churches on Fifth Avenue or 
otherwise try to make modern life into medieval 
molds, and if you find that the two sets of things 
make a total failure of their partnership, you can 
either find fault with the attempt to unite them or 
you can find fault with modern life. That is what 
Dr. Cram does in his three recent books. He does 
it very well indeed; few people could read these 
essays without finding themselves in frequent agree- 
ment with the writer, for his arraignment of our 
period is the result of careful study and is well 
documented. But it is one thing to see an evil 
and another to propose an effective remedy for it. 
With all the interest that attaches to the author's 
account of The Great Thousand Years, he is un- 
convincing when he states that " the base of opera- 
tions for the regime will be, so far as man can 
make it, the base established by the era we call 
Mediaevalism." Doubt comes into one's mind, 
however, if only because of the length to which he 
goes in his claims, as when, a few lines below, in 
speaking of the period between the years 500 and 
1500, he says: "Beside its ideals, its 'impulses, its 
achievements, all that went before seems tentative, 
all that follows shall I say it? slightly ridicu- 
lous." We all like to listen to a man who has 
enthusiasm for his subject, but when it warps him 
away from a balanced judgment of life as a whole, 
he forfeits' all right to serve as a guide. 

How can one read The Nemesis of Mediocrity 
with that secure feeling which one has in following 
the logic of an impartial writer, when one remem- 
bers that it is a sort of party pamphlet, designed to 
turn votes to a certain group of candidates in the 
race for world leadership? If one does not remem- 
ber it, the author reminds one of the fact by such

gan, Carnegie and the great Hebrew financiers of 
Europe. They will offer Ford, Harmsworth, 
Hearst; the packers of Chicago, the mill magnates 
of New England, the coal and iron barons of 
Pennsylvania." Had Dr. Cram been a little less 
explicit, with his Fords and his Hearsts and his 
Chicago packers, he might have more chance of 
convincing the reader that the " modernism " he is 
on the track of is a successful working out of what 
is essential in our time. 

He does not know our time; he docs not know 
the relation of one epoch to another, else he could 
not write: " Certainly there is something in vers 
libre and post impressionism and the products of the 
cubist sculptors that escapes one in Browning and 
Burne-Jones and Saint Gaudens. . . . But when it 
is assumed that they take their place, the argument 
needs fortifying by something other than either the 
dictum itself or their own accomplishments." Dr. 
Cram might again have made out a stronger case 
for the preceding decades had he known to choose 
better representatives of it than Burne-Jones and 
Saint Gaudens. There is no proof in questions of 
art, so that the fortifying something which is to go 
beyond present-day achievement, and our opinions of 
it, cannot be given until posterity delivers its judg- 
ment. Aside from all the " modernistic " conviction 
one may have that Matisse and Duchamp-Villion 
are immeasurably better artists than those cited by 
Dr. Cram to drive home his idea of the mediocrity 
of today, there is his more demonstrable error as 
to the men of one period taking the place of another. 
Do the Gothic artists beloved of Dr. Cram and 
everyone else " take the place " of the Greeks? 
Not even he would be apt to claim that. They 
lived their lives, sublimely creative, sublimely free 
from a past with which they had no concern. That 
he does not see this as the real example they have 
to offer us is proof that Dr. Cram has yet to get 
deeper into the meaning of their period. 

SAUL. By Corinne Lowe. 347 pages. McCann, 
New York. 

" Can any gentile really understand Jewish 
traits and characteristics well enough to embody 
them in a novel which portrays an intimate idea 
of the development of the Jewish character ? " asks, 
the jacket of Miss Lowe's book. If Saul is the 
answer, it must be " no. " The author has caught 
practically everything except that au-dela, lacking 
which the spirit fails. She has evidently studied 
the garment trade quite carefully: she knows the 
legitimate and the dubious intrigues which make 
business a kind of sordid game; she understands the 
interplay between wholesaler and retailer; she is 
reasonably right in her dialect. But these things 
are bare externals; what she is avowedly trying for 
is the Jewish character. Her idea of it is the 



familiar one of a blend of commercial bravado and 
artistic sensitiveness. But her treatment of it is 
that of an amateur who uses all the ingredients the 
cook-book demands, and curiously fails to obtain an 
edible mess. One is painfully aware of the author 
watching her water boil, and measuring out her 
spices. The book is readable enough, as the com- 
mon run of novels go in this novel-reading and 
novel-writing country. But it is American cooking ; 
the Jew wants something richer and fragrant with 
a more intimate national savor. 

MUSEUM IDEALS OF PURPOSE AND METHOD. 
By I. Gilman. 434 pages. Museum of Fine * 
Arts, Boston. 

This book, though a reprint of occasional papers 
dating mainly from the last fifteen years, would 
appear to^be the product of a lifetime devoted to 
museum work by an almost restlessly alert mind. 
The essays, printed originally in journals of art, 
education, science, and architecture, range from 
the most glittering generalities of esthetic theory 
to the concretest directions how to bind a " gal- 
lery book " or to fold a " skiascope" ; but, though 
so diversified and of so scattered origin, they form 
as a whole an extraordinary exposition of theory 
on collecting for art museums; on housing, install- 
ing, and interpreting such collections to the public; 
and on administering ' such institutions efficiently. 
Since the great royal collections of Europe were 
nationalized, still more since the recent American 
collections were formed, museums have felt under 
increasing obligation to reach the public for which 
they exist. The appropriation of public taxes to 
modern municipal galleries (the Boston museum 
is still, however, privately supported) has increased 
this obligation, so that museum workers seem to feel 
that they must select and install, so far as is possible 
without sacrifice of artistic standard, for the man 
in the street. Indeed some sentences in Mr. Gil- 
man's book almost imply the obligation to go into 
the byways and hedges and compel, or at least 
entreat, the man in from the street. There is an 
infectious and apostolic fervor in this faith that 
beautiful things express an ennobling gospel, and 
that a burden is laid upon the museum to preach 
it. The museum, as Mr. Gilman puts it, may 
not longer remain "gardant," but must become 
" monstrant " and even " decent." 

This aim must not, however, conflict with the 
dominance of the right, esthetic purpose over the 
mistaken, educational one. Upon no idea is Mr. 
Oilman's discussion more insistent, urging a com- 
plete abandonment of the conceptions and interests 
current in the latter years of the last century and 
influential upon the larger public art museums 
then established. Through the Victorian era taste 
centered upon the intellectual content of works of 
art, which were mainly paintings of portraits or 
literary or religious subjects. Of the ethical or the 
narrative and anecdotic strain in British art the

Tate gallery is a monument; and it was encouraged 
by the moralizing criticism of Ruskin. In Amer- 
ican taste a more naive expression appeared in 
Hawthorne's discussions in The Marble I^aun, which 
may be strikingly paralleled from the letters and 
journals of Washington Allston. But two counter 
influences arose toward the end of the century: the 
revival, associated with the name of William 
Morris, of decorative art, which almost ignores 
intellectual content and appeals through line, area, 
form, and color; and the rise of appreciation of 
Japanese art, which so strongly subordinates the 
representative motive. So long as this intellectual 
appeal of artistic productions remained dominant, 
the art museum filled an educational function: its 
collections aimed at continuity or completeness as 
a history of the arts; its installation considered 
mainly historical or biographical relations. Evi- 
dently these must frequently conflict with a purely 
esthetic ideal, of showing only the most beautiful 
things beautifully installed. The synthesis of these 
two interests is the task of the museum today. 

THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND AND NORMANDY. 
By Sir Francis Palgrave. 2 Vols. Putnam. 

Presumably Sir Francis Palgrave discusses Eng- 
land in the latter part of his four volume work : for 
in the two volumes under review he confines him- 
self to a study of Western Europe during the ninth 
and tenth centuries. Of all the epochs of European 
history this is certainly the most anarchical, the most 
devoid of all central authority. It is equally far 
removed from the Roman Empire and the modern 
state. The grandiose realm of Charlemagne, which 
united Europe from the North Sea to the Mediter- 
ranean and from the Elbe to the Ebro, fell to pieces 
soon after the death of its founder. No Hildebrand 
had yet come to regenerate the medieval Papacy and 
raise it to a position where it could assume the 
powers and responsibilities of an international high 
court of .justice. The historian of this dark and 
troubled era is confronted by several obvious dif- 
ficulties. He has no dominant motive of national 
development or imperial expansion to guide him; 
he has no Tacitus or Thucydides to give a vivid and 
intelligible interpretation of the spirit and person- 
alities of the time. Instead he has to grope his way 
through a maze of inchoate states, whose boundaries 
change overnight with bewildering rapidity. For 
his sources of information he must rely upon monk- 
ish chroniclers, who are often prejudiced, usually 
ill informed, and always dull. At the same time an 
historical genius could certainly make a great deal 
out of this period of flux and transition from ancient 
to modern civilization. The curious mixture of 
Roman and Teutonic laws and customs, the various 
peculiar features of the feudal system, the first signs 
of budding French and German nationalism, all 
these themes and many others offer promise to the 
investigator whose scientific accuracy is touched with 
a certain measure of imagination. Sir Francis Pal- 



grave, however, scarcely rises to his opportunities. 
He has a great deal more to say about the 
genealogical tables of the Carlovingian family than 
about the life of the peoples whom they misgov- 
erned. His work is a purely political chronicle; it 
ignores the cultural and economic factors which 
alone make a political chronicle intelligible. Sir 
Francis' volumes provide a large quantity of detailed 
information for the special student of medieval 
history; otherwise their appeal is distinctly limited. 

THE FIVE REPUBLICS OF CENTRAL AMERICA. 
By Dana J. Munro. 332 pages. Oxford Uni- 
versity Press. 

The author spent some two years in these 
countries and derived his information as far as 
possible at first hand. It is the fairest presentation 
of conditions and problems yet made and is indis- 
pensable to everyone in the least interested in the 
Isthmian lands. After a brief description of the 
Isthmian region as a whole, Munro sharply dis- 
tinguishes the three parts into which it actually 
separates Guatemala, Salvador-Honduras-Nica- 
ragua, and Costa Rica. The large, northern re- 
public of Guatemala has always had a dominant 
influence. In Spanish times it was the center of 
administration. Too rich and powerful to be will- 
ing to subordinate itself in a society of nations, it 
has always been the chief obstacle to every plan of 
union. With a population three-quarters made up 
of pure Indians, it has been a land of large estates, 
the successful development of which has depended 
upon the worst kind of peon labor. The three 
middle republics Salvador, Honduras, and 
Nicaragua have much in common. The popula- 
tion is almost wholly mestizo mixed blood there 
being few pure Indians. In Nicaragua and 
Honduras there is much undeveloped land and a 
scant population. Turbulence and revolution have 
been conspicuous. Salvador is, in many ways, the 
most interesting part of the Isthmus. It has the 
densest population in any American country, yet is 
the smallest republic of the New World continents. 
It exhibits an industry and enterprise beyond its 
neighbors and has ever been notable for advanced 
and liberal ideas in politics. Natural community of 
interests, general similarity of population, and 
geographical position unite it, however, with the 
other two; and there is no good reason why the 
three should not combine into one aggressive and 
developing nation, with Salvador as leader. The re- 
public of Costa Rica has always pursued a rather 
independent line of development. The Indian is of 
no importance in her present population; the tur- 
bulent mestizo is less in evidence than in the three 
middle republics; Spanish blood is present in larger 
proportion than anywhere else in Central America. 
Land is chiefly in small holdings and the owners 
have been more inclined to occupy themselves in its 
development than elsewhere. The people have been 
ambitious, but politics have been sane; revolutions

have been few ; though tenacious of her rights, Costa 
Rica has largely left 'her neighbors to themselves. 

Munro studies the problems of Central America 
in detail. That the five republics might wisely 
unite has been recognized from the first. Almost* 
immediately after their bloodless revolution against 
Spain, they did unite into a nation of Central 
AJnerica. That has not been the only attempt at 
union. Not only have general unions of all been 
attempted, but many efforts have been made to com- 
bine two or three of the middle republics. Revolu- 
tions have been so common in Central America as 
to become a byword. Still, where they have 
not been instigated by outsiders, there has usually 
been some actual principle or legitimate tendency 
involved. Wars between the republics have been 
frequent and unfortunate. Our own interference 
in Central American affairs has done little good 
.UK! has been chiefly effective in arousing distrust 
and hatred. The Conference of Washington in 
1907, held at our instigation, gave promise of re- 
sult by the neutralization of Honduras and the 
establishment of the Central American Court and 
the International Office, but the influence of these 
has been more than destroyed by our inexcusable 
interference through years in Nicaragua and our 
defiance of the decisions of the Court when they 
are adverse to our schemes. There has been little 
of self-determination for the Central American re- 
publics since 1909, and our interference dictated 
purely by commercial policies has been continuous 
and selfish. 

ENGLISH LITERATURE DURING THE LAST HALF 
CENTURY. By John W. Cunliffe. 315 pages. 
Macmillan. 

This volume, which is neither oppressively erudite 
nor superficially popular in style, discusses the chief 
figures in English literature during the past fifty 
years or so. Professor Cunliffe, who is a professor 
of English in Columbia University and Associate 
Director of the School of Journalism, has met the 
need for accessible and accurate information con- 
cerning the life and works of the more recent 
writers, some of whom, indeed, are still actively 
producing books. Hence his study has for its pur- 
pose more the giving of helpful information concern- 
ing the authors of the period, than ex cathedra 
utterances as to their literary precedence. This is 
an extremely useful handbook for students and an 
excellent reference work for libraries. The critical 
estim.it is .iiul theories are sound and sane, so that 
the uninformed reader would not go astray in fol- 
lowing the ideas expressed. The style is careful yet 
easy, and while for the most part reserved rather 
than impassioned, it has passages of happy sympathy. 
From among the authors now dead, Professor Cun- 
lift'e selects for analysis George Meredith, Samuel 
Butler, Robert Louis Stevenson, and George Giss- 
ing. Of the living, he takes up Hardy, Shaw, 
Kipling, Conrad, Wells, Galsworthy, and Bennett. 



In addition, there are interesting chapters on The 
Irish Movement, The New Poets, and The New 
Novelists. The new poets whom he treats of are 
Masefield, Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Wilson Gib- 
son, William H. Davies, Walter de La Mare, and 
Lascellcs Abcrcrombie, while the present-day novel- 
ists to whom he assigns places of prominence are 
Hugh Walpole, Gilbert Cannan, Compton Macken- 
zie, and D. H. Lawrence. 

DICTIONARY OF THK APOSTOLIC CHURCH 
Edited by James Hastings. 2 Vols. Scribner. 

Hastings 1 Dictionaries in various branches of the 
field of religion appear with marvelous fecundity. 
The latest manifestation features its debut with the 
apologetic explanation that it is a companion to the 
earlier Dictionary of Christ and the ( Jospels, car- 
rying the history of the Christian Church to the 
end of the first century and forming a complete dic- 
tionary of the New Testament. These last volumes 
maintain the high standard of the previous Hastings 
works in neatness of appearance, order of arrange- 
ment, completeness of scope, and character of 
articles, which are by leading scholars in the New 
Testament field. The tone of the individual 
articles is predominantly that of scientific biblical 
criticism. But because of their assumption of the 
knowledge of materia critica languages, technical 
terms, and so forth on the part of the reader, they 
make the dictionary essentially one for scholars. 
This may do for British clergymen, but will not 
meet the need of the average American Protestant 
pastor. There is still a great need for a dictionary 
conveying the results of critical scholarship with a 
simplicity and perspicacity compatible with the train- 
ing of the American ministry, and not confining 
itself exclusively to critical problems. 

ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTIVE PHILOSOPHY. 
By J. S. Mackenzie. 487 pages. Macmillan. 

Professor Mackenzie's erudition is immense, 
and his learning is no more unusual than his clear- 
ness of presentation and his admirable spirit. He is 
scholarly and interesting without a suggestion of 
the "high-brow" or a touch of the dilettante. His 
book is an illuminating illustration of the riches 
connected by the term scholarship. From the Greeks 
down through the contemporary neo-realists and 
pragmatists he has read and meditated his way, 
teaming much from this long history of specula- 
tion, but bowing to no philosophic dogma. What- 
ever one may think of the author's philosophic 
method (which is essentially that of Descartes), 
whether one accepts his revised Hegelianism or not, 
one appreciates the thoroughness with which he did 
his work. The author is evidently one of those 
rare people who do not grow old, so that his book 
has lost nothing but superficiality for being begun 
over a quarter of a century ago. 

In my judgment, Elements of Constructive 
Philosophy should be in every public library.

There are few problems which engage the attention 
of the more serious minded which would not be 
illuminated by a reading of sections devoted to the 
topic in question. I mention at random such ques- 
tions as, the nature of personality, the question of 
immortality, the conception of value, the significance 
of social consciousness, the problem of human free- 
dom, as well as more technical subjects, such as, 
causation, the structure of the universe, the nature 
of truth and reality, and so on. Incidentally the 
author is a demonstration of the fact that one may 
join the pragmatists in their demand that philosophy 
be a guide of life instead of a dialectical ring around 
the rosie, and yet refuse to accept their dictum that 
only the problems which they find interesting have 
meaning and significance. Professor Mackenzie 
revels in what the pragmatists call dead issues, 
while all the while his central interest is Life. 

In common with many teachers who have devoted 
years to their subject, he takes for granted a great 
deal more in the way of specialized background than 
his readers are prepared to supply. This defect is 
to some extent made good for those who intend to 
specialize in philosophy, by continuous reference to 
a wide variety of well-selected philosophical litera- 
ture, but for the rest the discussion remains too 
fragmentary to accomplish the result the author aims 
at. Nevertheless, to college students seriously in- 
terested in philosophy, and to any one willing to 
devote some years of more or less continuous study 
to the achievement of a comprehensive Weltan- 
schauung, Professor Mackenzie's book may be 
recommended as an excellent guide. And one may 
fairly promise the student who thus associates with 
Professor Mackenzie, what Protagoras promised 
those who came to him: he will return home the 
first day a wiser and better man than when he 
came, and wiser and better on the second day than 
on the first. 

SECOND MARRIAGE. By Viola Meynell. 380 
pages. Doran. 

A cumulative sense of dissatisfaction attends the 
reading of Miss Meynell's latest book the first, by 
the way, of her several successful novels to be 
brought out in America. Not that the book is 
bleakly uninspired quite the contrary but the 
flashes of inspiration are so fitful that the failure of 
the author to come through to large accomplishment 
is disappointing, the inevitable consequence of larger 
promises unfulfilled. Like one of her characters, 
Arnold, Miss Meynell is perpetually defeating her- 
self because of her vagrant interests. She is unwill- 
ing to concentrate to let her keen superficial 
observations of personality deepen into sound knowl- 
edge of character lest in so doing she lose, for her- 
self and us, even one passing acquaintance, one 
transient scene. Yet Second Marriage is capably 
written, and should Miss Meynell ever come to 
brood intently upon her characters, she would prob- 
ably produce a novel at once significant and full.

sents two papers which appeared originally in The 
Round Table, and incidentally adheres to that 
journal's annoying tradition of anonymity. With an 
air of judicious detachment the author draws a fine 
distinction between the "tyranny" of Lenin and the 
" firm " policy of Kolchak. Then, having empha- 
sized the fact that " in its present form Bolshevism 
must either spread or die," he offers to the Allies the 
choice between neutrality and intervention, peace and v 
war. This, as if the choice were yet to be made ! 



Intervention in Mexico, by Samuel Guy Inman (243 
pages; Association Press), faces very frankly the 
difficulties of the Mexican situation, and suggests as 
a remedy, not intervention, but the development, with 
the financial aid of the United States, of a program 
of educational, social, literary, and medical activi- 
ties designed to build a Mexican citizenship fully 
capable of self-government. Review later. 

China of the Chinese, by E. T. C. Werner (309 pages; 
Scribner), offers an historical study of Chinese domes- 
tic, ceremonial, political, and ecclesiastical institu- 
tions, prefaced by a short summary of the country's 
political history. Review later. 

French Ways and Their Meaning, by Edith Wharton (149 
pages; Appleton), is an intimate and interesting com- 
mentary, with wisdom enough in some of its single 
sentences to furnish the raison d'etre of a more pre- 
tentious volume. Review later. 



Government Organization in War Time and After, 

by William Franklin Willoughby (370 pages; Apple- 
ton), as a matter-of-fact survey of Federal agencies 
not even dimly forecast in the Constitution, may well 
serve as a basis for a political analysis of a com- 
pletely mobilized state. 

American Foreign Trade, by Charles M. Pepper (350 
pages; Century), blows the call to " a new era . . . 
an era of competition," when the American business 
man will find himself " a world business man " and 
the United States will be the exemplar, in the foreign 
field, of the economic individualism which has proved 
so highly salutary at home. 

After-War Atlas and Gazetteer of the World, edited by 
Francis J. Reynolds (364 pages; Reynolds Publishing 
Co., New York), combines a multiplicity of maps, 
both of cities and of countries including the bound- 
aries established by the first treaty of Versailles 
with a commentary on the war and a digest of state 
motor laws. A book that lives up to American 
standards of mapmaking. 

The Heroic Record of the British Navy, by Archibald 
Hurd and H. H. Bashford (303 pages; Doubleday, 
Page), is a thoroughly British appraisal of thfe part 
that maritime power played in the war. Its bias may 
be judged from its claim of the Jutland affair as a 
great victory for the English fleet. The war itself 
is held to have been a sailors' triumph. 

Frederick the Great, by Norwood Young (433 pages; 
Holt), purposes to throw new light on the career 
that Carlyle so worshipfully interpreted and to this 
end introduces new material. Review later.

Woman: Her Sex and Love Life 

FOR MEN AND WOMEN 

By WILLIAM J. ROBINSON, M. D. 

THIS is one of Dr. Robinson's most important 
and most useful books. It is not devoted to 
abstruse discussions or doubtful theories ; it is full 
of practical information of vital importance to 
every woman and through her to every man, to 
every wife and through her to every husband. 

The simple, practical points contained in its 
pages would render millions of homes happier 
abodes than they are now ; they would prevent 
the disruption of many a family ; they show how to 
hold the love of a man, how to preserve sexual 
attraction, how to remain young beyond the usually 
allotted age. The book destroys many injurious 
errors and superstitious and teaches truths that 
have never been presented in any other book be- 
fore. In short, this book not only imparts inter- 
esting facts ; it gives practical points which will 
make thousands of women and thousands of men 
happier, healthier, and more satisfied with life. 
Certain chapters or even paragraphs are alone 
worth the price of the book.

The Napoleon of the Pacific, by Herbert H. Gowen (326 
pages; Revell), recounts the life-history of Kame- 
hameha I, called the Great, who ruled, one hundred 
years ago, as emperor of the mid-Pacific islands now 
ignominiously devoted to the production of sugar, 
ukuleles, and comic opera atmosphere. 

Employment Psychology, by Henry C. Link (440 pages; 
Macmillan), applies the technique of the psycholog- 
ical laboratory to the selection and training of work- 
ers. The tests devised by Dr. Link were developed 
under actual factory and office conditions. A scien- 
tific work, not to be confused with the pseudo- 
psychology of character reading to which many 
" practical " business men have become addicted. 
Review later. 



The New Science of Analysing Character, by Harry H. 
Balkin (249 pages; Four Seas Co.), is a familiar 
attempt to put phrenology to work for business profit. 
The futility of explaining the complex combinations 
that make up an individual character in terms of 
these abstract formulae is no less evident in this 
book than in its numerous predecessors. 

How to Teach Religion: Principles and Methods, by 
George Herbert Betts (223 pages; Abingdon Press), 
treats the content of religion as identical with that of 
ethics, and indicates how this material may be used 
effectively in classroom work. Its perception of values 
is not keen enough to differentiate the instincts of 
wonder and self-abasement from the conventional 
attitudes of religiosity. 



Industrial Nursing, by Florence Swift Wright (179 pages; 
Macmillan), addresses itself to industrial, public 
health, and pupil nurses, and employers of labor. It 
discusses the history of industrial nursing, the train- 
ing needed, the routine of the day's work, and the 
interrelation of the nurse and the employment office. 

Towards Racial Health, by Norah H. March (320 pages; 
Dutton), endeavors to provide parents, teachers, and 
social workers with the means of guiding the mental 
and sexual life of the adolescent. The soundness of 
the author's biological background is attested by Pro- 
fessor J. Arthur Thomson's commendatory foreword, 
while her willingness to deal with delicate practical 
difficulties betrays the sympathetic understanding and 
intimate personal knowledge of the teacher. 

Social Games and Group Dances, by J. C. Elsom and 
Blanche Trilling (illustrated, 258 pages; Lippincott, 
Philadelphia), is the most useful collection of "ice 
breakers " yet elicited by the community movement. 

Town Improvement, by Frederick Noble Evans (261 
pages; Appleton), is evidence of this publisher's gen- 
erous interest in municipal improvement rather than 
of the author's ability to add any new elements to a 
phase of city planning which the works of Nolen, 
Robinson, Zueblin, and Lewis have fully explored. A 
new and more searching investigation of the nature 
of cities is needed, rather than a simplification of 
facts and formulae already notorious. 

New Towns After the War: An Argument for Garden 
Cities, by New Townsmen (84 pages; Dent, London), 
begins with a recognition of Great Britain's shortage 
of 1,000,000 houses and shows how the situation may 
be turned to advantage by building new garden 
cities at least a hundred of them on the Letch- 
worth plan. 

The Housing of the Unskilled Wage Earner, by Edith 
Elmer Wood (321 pages; Macmillan), examines the 
provisions for housing and housing legislation in both 
the United States and Europe. A contribution much 
needed in a field where the only simila'r volume, 
Veiller's Handbook, is now almost a decade old. 

Farm Management, by Jacob Hiram Arnold (243 pages; 
Macmillan), describes with clarity and conciseness 
what the modern farm is, how it functions, and what 
its relations are to business and the State. Apart 
from university courses in agricultural economics the 
student of rural problems would look in vain for any 
single treatment of the subject to equal the present 
one. 



The Evolution of the Dragon, by G. Elliot Smith (il- 
lustrated, 234 pages; Longmans, Green), has all the 
virtues and most of the vices of scholarly specula- 
tion in a field where the investigating scholar is not 
professionally at home. While the Professor of 
Anatomy at Manchester has tracked the dragon with 
provocative enthusiasm, daring conjecture, and .un- 
remitting ingenuity, he has also out-anthropologized 
the most doctrinaire anthropology in support of his 
persuasion that religion had a single source, from 
which it spread over the earth, and he has permitted 
himself enough disorder, repetition, and, discursive- 
ness to weaken confidence in his methods. 

A Handbook of Greek Vase Painting, by Mary A. B. 

Herford (125 pages; Longmans, Green), a compre- 
hensive study, fully illustrated, is calculated to de- 
light any reader capable of being interested in one 
of the most significant forms of antique art and in- 
its relations to the life of the period. The author's 
contagious zest makes fascinating a subject which 
would otherwise attract chiefly students of art and 
archaeology. 

Violin Mastery, by Frederick H. Martens (292 pages;: 
Stokes), is a symposium of interviews with twenty- 
four violinists from Ysaye to Toscha Seidel in- 
troduced by biographical notes and decorated with 
photographs. Yet this bushel of professional chaff 
will yield the pupil many a sound kernel of advice. 

Canoeing, Sailing and Motor Boating, by Warren H. Mil- 
ler (351 pages; Doran), is a wise and racily written 
treatise for the not too green amateur waterman. 
The author has evidently had broad experience in all 
three sports and, what is more unusual, has reflected" 
upon his experience. His genuinely helpful advice 
has the assistance of many excellent photographs and 
plans. 

How Animals Talk, by William J. Long (illustrated in- 
color, 303 pages; Harper), bolsters its pseudo-scien- 
tific convictions with romance and conjures up more 
engaging reading from such materials as " Chumfo, 
the Super-Sense," " The Swarm Spirit," and " Natu- 
ral Telepathy " than fact permits the more scientifi- 
cally-minded authors of animal books, who may 
recognize in this one a belated addition to their 
nursery shelves. 

Bass, Pike, Perch and Other Game Fishes, by James A. 
Henshall (410 pages; Stewart & Kidd, Cincinnati), 
is a comprehensive manual by a veteran fisher, its 
scope indicated by the title and its text supplemented 
with numerous illustrations. A readable guide for 
the angler, whether with bait or artificial fly.

Children^ 
School 

For boys and girls from 2 to 10 years 

The Children's School attempts to create an all-day all-round life for the city child, 
through modern educational methods based on fundamental sources of thought and action. 
It strives to relate the necessary studies directly to the life of the normal child, so that 
reading, writing, arithmetic, history, and geography do not seem tasks superimposed on 
him, but appeal to him as natural and interesting accompaniments of his unfolding world. 

The school plan embraces all-day activities, hot lunches, afternoon trips. There is a 
large double-roof playground, carpentry shops, an auditorium for music and dancing. 
Curriculum includes outdoor nature study, modeling and drawing, spoken French, science. 
The children are developed in small groups to assure a maximum of personal attention. 
The activities of the younger groups are carried on largely out of doors. 

The teaching staff consists of carefully selected specialists in their several fields. It 
includes Dr. Hendrik Willem Van Loon, the historian, formerly Lecturer in History at 
Cornell University, and M. Ernest Bloch, the noted Swiss composer.

Tales of Fishes, by Zane Grey (266 pages; Harper), 
presents a novelist wielding pen and rod simul- 
taneously, thereby banishing a host of preconceptions 
concerning the sedentary nature of angling. To one 
unacquainted with tuna fish except in salad, the 
narrative becomes a revelation of adventure. Sword- 
fish, shark, and dolphin yield zestful chapters. 

The Hand of the Potter, by Theodore Dreiser (209 
pages; Boni & Liveright), a "tragedy" in four acts, 
should suffice, by its incredibly inept construction, to 
remove the last doubt whether its author is capable 
of mastering any existing technique. Upon an 
authentic background of East Side family life he 
has presented a courageous and understanding pic- 
ture of a certain kind of erotic pathology and then 
has squandered his materials in a sensational plot 
that is as clumsy melodrama as it is arbitrary 
tragedy. 

The Will of Song, devised in cooperation with Harry 
Barnhart by Percy MacKaye (70 pages; Boni & 
Liveright), a "dramatic service of community sing- 
ing," is intended for use as a two days' festival. 
The poet continues to heap allegory on the heads of 
the people; he is a crusader trying to set up America 
as his holyland. Review later. 

The Seven Who Slept, by A. Kingsley Porter (96 pages; 
Marshall Jones, Boston), is a mystery play so mys- 
terious that the thirty-three page introduction is not 
sufficiently long and certainly not sufficiently exposi- 
tory. < 

Flowers in the Wind, by G. Murray Atkin (58 pages; 
Kennerley), is a slender sheaf of verse, sensitive and 
poetic in conception, graceful and delicate in imagery, 
but not always with a sure grasp of cadence. Mr. 
Atkin does not, at any rate, drape the garments of 
poetry upon the effigy of his own affectations. 

Poems, by Theodore Maynard (169 pages; Stokes), 
" represents the author's own selection of such of his 
published verse as he wishes included in a permanent 
collection." The permanence of the collection will 
be less fostered by the poems than by the valorous 
and undeviating wrongness of G. K. Chesterton's 
adulatory preface. 

Simla, by Stanwood Cobb (145 pages; Cornhill), is a 
narrative in verse in which the author seeks to " solve 
simply and well the mystery of sex " through a some- 
what superficial amalgam of Oriental asceticism and 
" the New World love of action and love of life." 
Complexities of rhyme and perplexities of philosophy 
have been assiduously ironed out. 

The Story of a Lover, Anonymous (201 pages; Boni & 
Liveright), is one of the extraordinary pieces of 
literature of recent years. Those interested in the 
newer literary tendencies will find in this intimate 
analysis of the emotions and reactions of a man 
toward his wife, his wife's lovers, and his own 
mistresses a depth of understanding that separates 
it widely from ordinary erotic literature. As an in- 
vestigation of the nuances of human relationships it 
is an invaluable psychological contribution. Review 
later. 

Mary Olivier: A Life, by May Sinclair (380 pages; Mac- 
millan), is a searching and adroit piece of work, in 
which the author traces the subjective development of 
a woman from earliest childhood to middle age. 
The book deals sanely with a precocious, rather 
morbid mentality. Review later. 



The Old Madhouse, by William De Morgan (567 pages; 
Holt), was completed by Mrs. De Morgan from notes 
left by the novelist. The art with which his lazy 
pages convey an intensive knowledge of the lives 
and motives of a small, intimate group of well-to-do 
English folk becomes evident only when it is replaced 
by her concluding narrative. Review later. 

The Position of Peggy Harper, by Leonard Merrick (296 
pages; Dutton), adds this study of stage success via 
brainlessness, pulchritude, and good luck to the 
handsome definitive edition of the novelist's works. 
Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's reminiscent introduction 
trades chiefly on the instinct for recognition. The 
novel itself was reviewed by Ruth Mclntire in THE 
DIAL for June 6, 1918. 

The Old Card, by Roland Pertwee (274 pages; Boni & 
Liveright), follows the career of an old-school actor 
through the more interesting episodes of his life. It 
is crisply written and offers unusually good enter- 
tainment to those with a taste for the stage. Inci- 
dentally, its picture of the theater in the English 
provinces is excellent realism. 

Little Houses, by George Woden (275 pages; Dutton), 
brings to attention a new English writer of genuine 
ability. Cast in the mood of the Five Towns the 
story follows the general plan of Arnold Bennett 
and Gilbert Cannan in their happier early period. 
Against the drab ba-ckground of an English mining 
town in the eighties this drama of small lives runs 
a vivid course sparkling with humor, deep in rich 
human sympathy and only slightly overcast with 
tragedy. There is in it an individuality and fresh- 
ness which cannot fail to satisfy the reader seeking 
reality in his fiction. 

A London Lot, by A. Neil Lyons (279 pages; Lane), 
makes one regret afresh that the Cockney classics 
of this author are so little known in America. This 
story, adapted from a play by the author, has to do 
with one Cuthbert, who left his barrow in care of his 
girl Cherry while he went to fight for King and 
Country. What Bairnsfather did in another me- 
dium Mr. Lyons has done here. It is well worth 
the reading for more than one reason. 

The Querrils, by Stacy Aumonier (354 pages; Century), 
is still another fictional portrayal of an English family 
and its reactions to the war. The novel has some 
fresh themes for instance, the essential selfishness of 
a general studied unselfishness within a close group 
but is almost devoid of the compact architecture and 
dry style that have characterized the best of the 
author's short stories. 

Mirabelle of Pampeluna, by Colette Yver (177 pages; 
Scribner), is a charming story of French life, caught 
up for a while in the mad rush of war, then settling 
again to the gentler ways of the deliberate past. 

The Secret of the Tower, by Anthony Hope (305 pages; 
Appleton), is a breathless mystery story, unusual in 
theme and bizarre in plot. It starts briskly and 
develops rapidly; the climax is startling and un- 
canny. Amid the suspense, the author finds space 
for adept character portrayal and flashes of humor. 

The Best Ghost Stories, introduction by Arthur B. Reeve 
(217 pages; Boni & Liveright), embodies a super- 
natural assault to chill the blood on a wintry night 
The collection ranges from De Foe and Bulwer- 
Lytton to Kipling and Blackwood.

Yellow Men Sleep, by Jeremy Lane (343 pages; Cen- 
tury), is a barefaced thriller, lurid and illogical, but 
with inventive and descriptive vigor so neatly applied 
that the momentum of sheer curiosity carries one 
past even the author's assurance that persons fatally 
stabbed become " quite dead." 

Partners of the Out -Trail, by Harold Bindloss (344 pages ; 
Stokes), is the routine story of adventure originating 
in the Canadian wilds. It approximates reality about 
as authentically as the scenic railway in the amuse- 
ment park approximates nature. 

Their Mutual Child, by Pelham Grenville Wodehouse 
(284 pages; Boni & Liveright), rolls art, eugenics, 
finance, and domestic complications into one pellet 
and coats it in a brisk, humorous narrative style. 
\ And whenever the somewhat conventional material 

threatens to lag, Mr. Wodehouse understands how to 
freshen it up with caricature. 

Just Jemima, by J. J. Bell (190 pages; Revell), is another 
of the author's dialect stories. A Scotch servant in a 
boarding house tells about herself, her love affair, 
and the guests. Jemima's personality hovers between 
the necessity for being dull enough to be menial, and 
the compulsion to be humorous enough to be readable. 

Cake Upon the Waters, by Zoe Akins (224 pages; Cen- 
tury), is all about a light-hearted, irresponsible widow 
with three suitors and an inheritance. To complete 
her conquests she captures a nice burglar and re- 
forms him in five minutes of chatty dialogue. A 
fluffy romance, smoothly powdered. 

Lo, and Behold Ye!, by Seumas MacManus (290 pages; 
Stokes), jocular Irish folk tales colloquially told, are 
monotonously dependent for plot on trickery and wit 
of a primitive sort. 

Mr. Dooley on Making a Will and Other Necessary Evils 

(2^21 pages; Scribner), enables that immortal Irish- 
man, whose tongue has lost none of its cunning, to 
make too tardy acknowledgement to Mr. Hennessy 
" a man who cud listen." 

On Uncle Sam's Water Wagon, by Helen Watkeys Moore

In the Sweet Dry and Dry, by Christopher Morley and 
Bart Haley (168 pages; Boni & Liveright), puts an 
antic disposition on the present dispensation, and like 
the old lady in the Barrie playlet, cherishes the cork 
in lieu of the liquid. The humor is broad a brew, 
rather than a distillation but a heady libation to the 
gods of absurdity.

A FORTNIGHTLY 







Liberalism in Japan 

I. THE INTELLECTUAL PREPARATION 



NE HEARD THE WORD frequently from the 
mouths of Japanese fellow travelers as one 
crossed the Pacific De-mo-kras-ie. The ani- 
mated, cultivated man, who after wearing the 
baggiest clothes of the ship blossomed out one 
day in a general's uniform with rows of medals, 
and turned out to be one of the heroes of the 
Russo-Japanese war, confided in you that he 
was on his way back from France to explain 
to his countrymen the new world situation and 
preach the gospel of democracy. An ardent 
returning student told you of an interview 
with a distinguished American educator in 
which the latter had said to him that the future 
relations of Japan and the United States were 
secure if both followed the same principles, 
and who added on his own account, "Yes, the 
same principles. We have had enough ex- 
change of compliments and fine words. We 
need to adopt American principles of democ- 
racy." And he avowed his intention of becom- 
ing an apostle of those principles. The day 
after landing, another returned student tells 
you that when he landed just a year before it 
was not safe to utter the word democracy, as 
it might send you to prison, but that now 
everybody was talking it, even coolies and 
ricksha-men. And the American educator who 
has lived in Japan fifteen years says that there 
has been more alteration in the spirit of Japan 
in the prior six months than he had seen in the 
whole fifteen years of residence. 

But the Japanese tell you that their opinions 
are unstable; that they are mercurial, easily 
aroused to follow the last intellectual fashion ; 
that they catch readily but superficially at the 
latest trend of ideas only to turn to another, 
even its opposite, when something more "up- 
to-date" comes along. So Nietzsche had given 
way to Eucken, the latter to James, and James 
to Bergson in the realm of those who coquet- 
ted with philosophy all in the last few years. 
Germany had been not merely ingloriously 
defeated but had collapsed in internal revolu- 
tion. America had come out with fine words 
and had surprisingly made its words good in 



deeds. Autocracy out of fashion, democratic 
styles were in. Was the change anything 
more than this? 

As one remained and became somewhat bet- 
ter acquainted with the currents of thought 
not an easy thing where the language is un- 
known and where every intellectual is a spe- 
cialist and assumes similar specialization of 
interest on your part one realized that the 
change was not so sudden as it seemed on the 
surface. All during the years of the most re- 
actionary conservatism and they were much 
more reactionary than the present writer at 
least had ever dreamed of there existed gen- 
uinely liberal thinkers and teachers. The in- 
filtration of the best Western ideas had been as 
steady if not as bulky as that of Western 
shoddy, physical and intellectual. The defeat 
of Germany had not so much brought about a 
sudden and superficial change as it had re- 
moved the lid. It became possible, almost 
popular, to say out loud what liberals had been 
saying quietly and steadily in the class room, 
or in the public press in language sufficiently 
veiled to pass the eye of the police. The 
change of fashion was a fact, was indeed a 
- large part of the situation. But it operated 
mainly to depress the prestige of the reaction- 
ary bureaucrats and to increase that of the 
liberals so that men were willing, and even 
glad, to listen to them. 

The seemingly abrupt alteration was in 
largest measure the appearance above the sur- 
face of a movement that had been long matur- 
ing assuredly a much healthier state of 
affairs. All during the war the lines had been 
drawing. Even before the final defeat of Ger- 
many there were a courageous few who dared 
to take the view that the war was between two 
systems and that Japan would remain in an 
anomalous position as long as she was the foe 
of Germany in war, but her disciple and fol- 
lower in government and educational methods. 
On the other hand, even in the midst of war 
against Germany, influential voices were 
raised defending German institutions, German

thought, and German ideals, and explaining 
that since Japan had made these her own and 
built her greatness upon them she was an 
enemy of Germany only in a military sense, 
and even that only for certain specific pur- 
poses. I was among those who heard Baron 
Ishii denounce German propaganda as respon- 
sible for alienation of feeling between the 
United States and Japan, and like many more 
of my countrymen I was much moved thereby. 
But when I reached Japan I marveled. For I 
found that intellectually, morally, and polit- 
ically an active German propaganda had been 
carried on during the war by Japanese offi- 
cials. I learned that in the army the conscript 
recruits had been systematically got together 
and taught the superiority of German institu- 
tions to those of the Allies, and especially the 
superiority of German militarism and the fact 
that it could not be defeated. I learned that 
on the very day when the armistice was de- 
clared an important intellectual figure was 
billed for a public lecture on Why Germany 
Cdnnot Be Defeated. 

These facts are not mentioned to rake up 
grounds of offense. They help explain the 
courage of the liberals who when the war was 
still undecided had said that Germany must be 
defeated not merely to oust her from the Far 
East, but because she was autocratic and mili- 
taristic, and begged the Japanese to eliminate 
from their own government and administra- 
tive methods all that Japan had borrowed from 
Germany lest Japan should in the end find her- 
self also at odds with the whole world. And 
the fact that the lines had been so openly and 
stringently drawn made the final defeat and 
still more the spectacular collapse of the in- 
vulnerable state a sensational victory for the 
liberals against the bureaucrats. It gave lib- 
eral and democratic ideas a vogue which they 
would not have had if there had not been dur- 
ing the war itself a struggle between the 
partisans and the opponents of German ideals 
and an application of the controversy to do- 
mestic politics. 

The highest wave of democratic sentiment 
in Japan has apparently receded since the win- 
ter and early spring months. The Japanese 
are quick often too quick and they have not 
failed to take home to themselves the lesson 
of the failure at Paris of the fine words which 
President WHson flourished when he took the 
United States into the war. It may be that the 
racial discrimination issue was raised at Paris 
as a smoke-screen to obfuscate the Shantung 
question diplomats other than Japanese have 
been known to raise a moral question when 
they wished to gain a material point. But 
there can be no doubt of the immense pop- 
ularity of the issue in Japan. The interest was 



clearly in part "accelerated" by politicians of 
light conscience, like Marquis Okuma, but 
there is no question of the popularity of the 
response. When the newspapers gave next to 
no attention to other problems of the Paris 
Conference they gave columns to this one. 
And the defeat of the proposal to insert a rec- 
ognition of the principle of equality of nations 
in the Preamble to the League Covenant was 
a blow to liberal thought. For it made it easy 
to assert that all the democratic professions of 
equality and humanity of the Allies during the 
war were part of a hypocritical propaganda. 
At the last, the Japanese proposal was 
whittled down to a Platonic and almost Pick- 
wickian statement. The more those who op- 
posed it believed that it was not offered in 
good faith but for ulterior purpose, the more 
willingly they should have favored it if only 
as a sop to sentiment and a slave to pride. Its 
rejection was worse than inhumane; it was 
stupid. To have accepted it would have been 
to create good feeling and also a frank and ob- 
jective basis for a discussion of immigration 
as an economic and political question, free 
frem entanglements with the question of racial 
prejudice. As it is, the two questions are still 
entangled, and the supporter of restricted im- 
migration on economic grounds (and political 
also till Japan has radically changed its form 
of government) is hampered by the bad con- 
science that comes from giving to Japan an 
opportunity to inject the question of race and 
color discrimination into the discussion. But 
for present purposes the consequence chiefly 
of importance is that the action of the Confer- 
ence gave a great tactical advantage to the 
Japanese upholder of things as they were and 
dampened the ardor for democratic ideas. 

The other leading force in giving liberal 
thought a temporary setback is the raising of 
the Chinese issue. "Patriotism" is more acute 
in Japan than in any country of the globe, and 
the press is more recklessly irresponsible than 
that of any other country of the globe. And 
the political consciousness of the people is still 
immature. Consequently the intelligent and 
critical discussion of foreign relations, hard 
enough in any country, is unusually difficult 
in Japan. In fact one of the ablest of the in- 
tellectual liberals in Japan said in spite of his 
democratic beliefs he dreaded the time when 
diplomacy should come in Japan more under 
popular influence, for the professional diplo- 
mats were much more enlightened, much more 
cosmopolitan, more sympathetic with Western 
ideas and ways than were the people, who are 
still blindly chauvinistic as was indicated in 
the riots that protested against the mildness 
of the terms of peace with Russia and that con- 
stantly clamors for a stronger foreign policy.

Anyhow, it was an easy matter to lead the 
mass of the Japanese people to think that there 
is a conspiracy to thwart the true national 
destiny of Japan in Asia and that nominally 
democratic countries, especially the United 
States, are at the bottom of this plot. And 
the militarist party has not been slow to point 
the moral or to hold up Japanese liberals as 
embryonic traitors who would weaken and 
destroy the national cause. It was not Japan 
that originated the motto "Our country right 
or wrong" or that originated the psychology 
which is sure that our country is always right. 
Consequently the Japanese liberals who wish 
to tell the truth about conditions in China 
and there are a good number of them at the 
same time temporarily handicap the liberal 
cause because they seem to be identified with 
an unpatriotic and anti-nationalistic cause. 

If the situation can develop in a reasonable 
normal way, there is no doubt as to where ulti- 
mate triumph will lie. It was European im- 
perialism that taught Japan that the only way 
in which it could be respected was to be strong 
in military and naval force. Not its art nor 
the exquisite courtesy of its people nor its 
eager curiosity gave Japan the rank of one of 
the Big Five at Paris. And none of these 
things brought triumph to its diplomats there. 
Until the world puts less confidence in mili- 
tary force and deals out justice internationally 
on some other basis than command of force, 
the progress of democracy in Japan will be 
uncertain, because in Japan more than any 
other country the strength of political reac- 
tionism centers in the army, in the ideas which 
it breeds and in the officials who come, will- 



ingly or unwillingly, under its influence. But, 
barring outside events, two great forces are 
working on the side of liberal ideas and in- 
stitutions. One is intellectual, the other eco- 
nomic. Japan is trying, under the leadership 
of its present rulers, an impossible experiment. 
It recognizes its dependence on the West for 
material, technical, and scientific development, 
and welcomes the introduction of Western 
ideas and methods so far as they concern these 
things. But it is trying at the same time to 
preserve intact its own peculiar moral and 
political heritage ; it is claiming superiority in 
these respects to anything the West can give it. 
It is another chosen nation, unique in origin 
and destiny. With extraordinary toughness 
and tenacity it has managed somehow to con- 
serve the feudal and even barbarian morale 
and politics of the warrior, while it has bor- 
rowed wholesale the entire scientific and in- 
dustrial technique of the world. But no nation 
can enduringly live a double life ; Japan shows 
everywhere the strain of this split in its life. 
Nor can the Japanese, even with all their power 
of resistance, indefinitely shut out the entrance 
of genuinely Western ideas and aims. These 
have crept in and are expelling the traditional 
ideas in spite of the most incredibly reaction- 
ary system of primary education the world 
has ever known. The first fruits of this creep- 
ing in is that release of liberal ideas which ac- 
companied the defeat of Germany. As one of 
the intellectual leaders of the new Japan put 
it, the change that has come over Japan in the 
last year is not describable in words; it is in- 
tellectual, moral, even metaphysical. 



JOHN DEWEY. 



The Passing of the Frontier 



JL HAT EMERSON HOUGH and Stewart Edward 
White belbng to different generations of the 
Middle West will be at once apparent to the 
reader of their contributions to the Chronicles 
of America Series, even if the personal history 
of the authors is unknown. Hough, who is a 
man of sixty or more, writes in the spirit of 
one who was a part of the life he describes and 
longs to recover, while White remains the 
keen-eyed reporter of the facts as he finds 
them recorded. 

In Hough's Passing of the Frontier (Yale 
University Press) there is much good history, 
but it is written in the wistful mood of the 
plainsman who hunted the buffalo, rode the 
long Texas trail, and camped beside the name- 
less mountain stream. In The Forty Niners 
(Yale University Press) White remains hu- 



morously critical throughout, assembling his 
evidence against his heroes quite as readily as 
'in their favor. His story is delightfully clear 
and very concise in statement. 

For example, he gives quite bluntly the 
actual record of John C. Fremont's exploits, 
and describes in a few pages the discovery of 
gold and the curiously haphazard founding of 
San Francisco, all in the calm spirit of histor- 
ical investigation. He strips the whole era of 
its falsely romantic atmosphere he even 
doubts the "idyllic character" of the Spanish 
occupation of California or at least he seems 
to think the facts of that life have been highly 
idealized. Nevertheless his temper remains 
admirable and his statements, being properly 
documented, are entirely convincing. Though 
a novelist, he has always observed for himself

and in this book he has stated his conclusions 
in his own way. He shows keen interest in the 
giants of those days but\he is not emotionally 
partisan. He is neither accusing them nor 
apologizing for them. There is loss as well as 
gain in this method of approach. His book 
convinces and informs, but fails to move his 
reader, admirable as his pages are. 

Hough on the contrary feels his subject 
deeply and dwells lovingly on certain of its 
phases. He betrays a reminiscent, youthful 
admiration for the men who rode bronchos, 
hunted bisen, and led ox-trains across the 
plains ; and in this retrospective glow he com- 
poses, somewhat as a poet might do, sentences 
which march and sing. The beauties of the 
oldtime plain, the epic sweep' of settlement 
and the stern battles of the border, are indi- 
cated with a fervor which is not customary in 
the mere historian. One of the most striking 
and eloquent passages in the book reads thus : 

The chief figure of the American West is not the 
long-haired fringed-legging man riding a raw-boned 
pony but the gaunt and sad-faced woman sitting on 
the front seat of the wagon, following her lord 
where he might lead, her face hidden in the same 
ragged sunbonnet which had crossed the Appa* 
lachians and the Missouri long before. That was 
America, my brethren! There was the seed of Am- 
erica's wealth. There was the great romance of all 
America the woman in the sunbonnet. 

In The Passing of the Frontier the trails and 
the trailmakers, the wars of the sheepmen and 
cattlemen, and the ultimate triumph of the 
small farmer are the large events which are 
treated in brief chapters. The coming of wire 
fences, the effect of railways on the migration 
of game as well as on the habits of the red 
hunter, the changes in the shipment of stock, 
all these are arranged as parts of a colossal and 
colorful drama in which the author had some 
part and for whose picturesque side he per- 
mits himself to utter a frank expression of 
admiration. One might almost say The Pass- 
ing of the Frontier is a threnody, so deeply 
colored is it by the somber meditation of the 
gray-haired man yielding himself to a resurg- 
ing love of the stirring days of old. The men 
were full-sized and red-blooded in those days, 
he says, and in his reminiscent joy I am able 
in some degree to share. 

In the beginning of one chapter he makes 
the very pertinent observation that there were 
in fact many frontiers, and that the Western 
movement (at least after 1840) proceeded by 
leaps and sudden rushes rather than by a regu- 
lar advance like an army on the march. There 
was a Middle Border, a Southwest Border, a 
Mountain Border, and a far-flung California 
Border as well. The cattle industry, the fur 
trade, the mining of gold, and the settlement 
of free lands on the plains each had its 
vedettes, its columns which split and at times 



almost lost all sense of formation in their ad- 
vance. My own experience was with the 
Middle Border as it moved from the Miss- 
issippi River across Iowa and Minnesota on 
into Dakota and Montana. My father and I 
followed close upon the Indian and the bison, 
but took no active part in their extinction. 

All these frontiers, as Hough points out, are 
now gone, utterly gone. America no longer 
has a region of mystery, of untracked spaces, 
and something fine and strong and free is pass- 
ing from our national life something the man 
of the East Side tenement cannot imagine, 
much less understand ; something which 
helped to make our fathers the unconquerable 
individualists they were. 

As in California the spirit of the Forty Niner 
(which was akin to that of the trapper and 
cowboy) has passed into something far less 
inspirational even if it seems more stable, so 
the plainsman has passed. The range has been 
plowed and billions of hens and hogs are 
swarming where the coyote and the prairie 
chicken sang. The plains are fenced; the red 
men are struggling with the plow. Hough 
mourns for the oldtime West and I, rejoicing 
in the fact that I was born early enough to 
know something of its inspiration and much 
of its charm, join in his lament : 

Always it has been the frontier which has allured 
many of our boldest souls. And always just back 
of the frontier, advancing, receding, crossing it this 
way and that, succeeding and failing, hoping and 
despairing but steadily advancing in the net result, 
has come that portion of the population which 
builds homes and lives in them, and which is not 
content with a blanket for a bed and the sky for a 
roof above. 

We had a frontier once. It was our most price- 
less possession. It has not been possible to elimi- 
nate from the blood of the American West, diluted 
though it has been by far less worthy strains, all 
the iron of the old home-bred frontiersman. The 
frontier has been a lasting and ineradicable influ- 
ence for the good of the United States. It was 
there we showed our fighting edge, our unconquer- 
able resolution, our undying faith. There, for a 
time at least, we were Americans. 

We had our frontier. We shall do ill indeed if 
we forget and abandon its strong lessons, its great 
hopes, its splendid human dreams. 

To this warning I add \vhatever force my 
signature may carry. Over against the bitter- 
ness which springs from the congestion of 
great cities I like to place the faith in which 
my pioneer sire wrought for over eighty years 
a faith in the open spaces which enabled him 
to think of reform without violence and of the 
prosperity of others without bitterness or hate. 
In a sense the frontier of American progress 
will never pass. So long as we have faith in 
the future and in the transforming effect of 
our winds and skies the gate of the sunset is 
open to the intellectual pathfinder, the trail- 
maker, the gold-seeker.

Why and Ho'w the ''Prices Change 



T is NOT MORE THAN AN AXIOM that the larger 
the fraction taken as its share by business 
enterprise out of the total product of industry 
the smaller must be the other shares. These 
are days of wide margins for the entrepreneur 
class great profits, high dividends declared, 
or high undivided profits for later declaration. 
A certain rubber company has just reported 
that "surplus earnings for the years 1917 and 
1918 were equivalent each year to about thirty 
per cent on the common stock; for the first 
half of 1919, substantially the same." In Octo- 
ber the common stock will go to an eight per 
cent dividend basis, and an extra dividend is 
promised early next year. The volume of busi- 
ness increased from 83 millions in 1914 to 215 
millions in 1918. The capital is about to be 
increased from 110 to 280 millions. 

Profiteering? It may be. But it is not an 
especially .extreme case. The four months' 
boom in the stock market has had its basis in 
a general increase in earnings over practically 
the entire field of established enterprise. This 
means that margins are wide between costs 
and selling prices wages and the other costs 
lagging behind the prices of products. The 
prices of products for consumption have been 
going up appallingly and are still going up. 

But the returns on corporate securities have 
to increase in number of dollars correspond- 
ingly with the changing prices, else the invest- 
ment share in the aggregate national product 
must have declined. In fact, this share has 
more than maintained itself. But the dollars 
accruing to bond and preferred stockholders 
do not increase in number, and continue to 
fall in purchasing power. Here is further 
room for a rise in dividends at the expense of 
the senior security holders without prejudice 
to the public. 

But still there may have been and may now 
be profiteering at the expense of consumers. 
While general prices have something less than 
doubled, business margins have more than 
trebled from something like 3 billions in 1914 
to 11 or 12 billions in 1918. 

Only, what is profiteering? Is it significant 
that for two years the rubber company men- 
tioned has been behind its orders and that 
practically all producers are reporting a sim- 
ilar inability to meet the demand for goods at 
ruling prices? It looks as if all might be get- 
ting still higher prices, imposing thus a fur- 
ther acceleration in the rate of rise. It is in 
any event clear that in this current inability 
to keep up with orders is the guaranty that 
prices are going still further to rise. 

Is there no end to it? And what good or 



evil cause is there for it all? What strange 
thing is hidden in the present situation to 
make it all so new and perplexing so good 
for dividends and for offered jobs, so bad for 
the consuming public? Clearly enough, it is 
not the Trusts. We have had them for a long 
time or they us. We have merely the same 
Trusts, operating now in a period of rapidly 
rising prices. The Packers may be grasping 
people; are probably in a combination. But 
in this also there is nothing new. Have the 
Trusts been doing something recently as to 
meat prices fixing these prices in any new 
sense or have they been merely .taking all 
possible advantage of the new price oppor- 
tunities that the new situation offers? Pos- 
sibly the margins are. outrageous probably 
they are. But, in any case, they are an insig- 
nificant fraction of the retail selling prices of 
meats. Never in fact have they been small. 
But now, when meats have risen twenty cents 
per pound, the cancellation of all these pack- 
ers' margins, the justified with the wicked, 
would leave a rise of 19 cents for buyers still 
to pay. 

Or the middlemen? They are a problem 
also, both tragic and comic in its seriousness. 
But they present no new problem excepting 
in the sense that now the middlemen are active 
in a period of rapid increase in prices. Nor is 
there reason to suppose that their exactions 
are now an increasing per cent of their turn- 
over. The toll is a scandal, the expense load- 
ing in retailing outrageous. But so it long has 
been. At present the rate of gross profit, the 
percentage of charge, is probably rather sub- 
normal than supernormal. In truth, in terms 
not of dollars of gain but of what the dollars 
will buy, the retailer is probably suffering 
with the rest of us. Such is, indeed, the nature 
of. the process of rising prices. Retail prices 
lag behind wholesale rise later and less. The 
dealer fixes his selling prices on the cost-plus 
basis. He figures his margins by percentages. 
In large part, therefore, it is the old and lower 
price that rules the present price. Not rarely, 
as now in the clothing trade, the dealer's sell- 
ing price is little above the price that he will 
have to pay for his fall stock of goods. Doubt- 
less the retailers may do some intermediate 
marking up, making thereby some small book 
gains on the rising prices of the stocks. But 
these are gains that are neither great nor real. 
The new and higher book capital will swing 
a smaller rather than a larger business. It is 
turnover that tells. The retailer has to keep 
up his stock.

THE DIAL 



So far, then, there is little to hope for from 
the folk at Washington that are enacting pop- 
gun bills and instituting pop-gun prosecutions. 
Good political strategy these things may all 
be, but they are sheer delusions for purposes 
f remedy promises that will never be liqui- 
dated. They are a part of the same uncom- 
prehending talk and fret that attended the rise 
in prices in the Revolution days of the French 
assignats; that was rife with the debacle of 
the Continental currency in our early history; 
that went on over the price-kiting- of the Civil 
War the same buzz and chatter that pre- 
vailed in Russia and Austria till the money 
had depreciated into practical disappearance 
the same angry beating against caging bars 
that is now general in France and Italy and 
England, where the prices still go up and 
where nothing avails to stop either the prices 
or the flow of denunciation about them. 

Then it must be the speculators, the ware- 
house men and the cold-storage men? Proceed 
we, then, against the speculators. But, after 
all, if these speculators will not sell the goods 
to us now buy them now to hold for sale to 
us later it must be that they expect us later 
to be willing to pay more for the goods than 
we are willing to pay now to get them. They 
have no notion of taking the goods away from 
us, but only of letting us have them at another 
time. It is the purpose of their buying now 
to supply us later at the higher prices that we 
can then be induced to pay. Their bidding 
away the goods from us now by raising the 
price offers us our sole hope of a supply later 
at any price. No doubt they are buying now 
dearer to sell later still dearer. And no doubt 
they buy the more keenly and push up prices 
the more rapidly as they see that prices are 
now in process of going up the more rapidly. 
But this brings us back to the same old ques- 
tion : what makes the prices in general rise ? 
And what makes these speculators and en- 
grossers and regraters and rascals-at-large so 
sure that prices are still further going to rise? 
These men are profiteers. But just this is 
what all men are in business. Profits are still 
the motive power. Why should the specula- 
tors be so exceptionally keen now to bid up 
prices against one another, in the lively expec- 
tation that good profits will still be left out of 
the later and still higher selling prices? 
Whence this confidence in a general price ad- 
vance all of the speculators proceeding on 
the assumption of advancing prices the bears 
merely expecting a lesser rise? The only 
thing novel about the present speculation is 
that it is a speculation in times of rapidly rising 
prices and in the expectation of a still further 
and rapid rise. What offers the bull operator 
the rising prices that are a special invitation 
to his speculative activities? Is he himself the 
maker of the prices on the basis of which and 



through the lure of which he speculates, and 
out of which he draws his gain the prices get- 
ting higher merely because he expects them to 
and decrees that they shall? But it is still open 
to anyone to speculate for a fall if he thinks 
well. No sane man so thinks. t 

It is, of course, obvious that if the storage 
man gets the eggs now, you and I must so far 
go without them now. The eggs cannot now 
be freezing for some speculator to supply for 
some later breakfast, at the same time that 
they are boiling for someone's present break- 
fast. Now or then, not now and then. If no 
one stores now, there must next January be a 
shortage of eggs for everyone's breakfast. The 
extreme of spring or summer plenty goes only 
with the extreme of winter dearth. Next Jan- 
uary we shall need the storage man and be 
glad to pay him his profit rather than have no 
eggs. He is a redistributor of consumption in 
point not of space but of time, determining 
not so much that there shall be more or fewer 
eggs per year the hens have that in charge- 
as that there shall be less at one season and 
more at another, a restricted consumption 
when there is a relative plenty, to the end that 
there shall be a less restriction when the cur- 
rent supplies are small. 

It would, in fact, go extremely ill with us if 
there were nowhere either storage men or 
storage women. If the warehousing and stor- 
ing profiteers are eliminated, the housewives 
will have to take charge : regrating and fore- 
stalling will have to go on with pickle jars and 
water glass and cold packing. No doubt the 
skilful housewife and the other sort of ras- 
cally speculators differ in this that the spec- 
ulator is holding to sell again to later users 
while the housewife is holding for the later 
use of her family. And precisely thus it comes 
about that when prices are rising the specu- 
lator may overdo the storage business as mat- 
ter of general welfare, and may yet make the 
thing pay him a good profit, solely because of 
the rising prices. So in times of falling prices 
speculative storage is too far limited from the 
point of view of the general good. Falling 
prices rising dollars discourage holding for 
a later sale, and thereby penalize society by 
future dearth for the instability of its currency. 
With currency moving toward depreciation 
cheaper dollars, rising prices speculative 
over-storage penalizes society for a reverse 
instability of its currency. Speculation has 
imperatively important functions. But it for- 
feits much or all of its serviceability if it must 
include in its operations not only the ex- 
changeable goods but the media for their ex- 
change. Speculation on the dollars' side of 
things is bad. Standards, to be standards, need 
to be stable. 

But to decree clearing out cold-storage 



1919 



THE DIAL

plants and the warehouses and elevators is not to 
provide a substitute service but merely to impose 
a substitute disease. Present prices are curbed and 
present consumption fostered on terms of imposing 
a later dearth and a more than offsetting advance 
in prices. This is merely the improvident post- 
ponement of an inevitable reckoning the best that 
is to be said of it being that probably it will come 
to nothing much anyway. But if something does 
come of it in the direction of eliminating the spec- 
ulator, it will be for the authorities that have dis- 
placed him to find something with which to replace 
him. To disregard at present the requirements of 
the future is to invite disaster. Price control, not 
a helter-skelter clearance, is the logical substitute 
for speculation. Rationing, in turn, is the logical 
and imperative supplement to price restriction. 
Artificially limited prices mean a stimulated pres- 
ent consumption speculatively enhanced prices, a 
restricted present consumption. In part, therefore, 
it is due to the stimulated consumption of last year 
and in part to the undue speculative restriction of 
this year that the stock of wheat on June I was 
nearly three-fold that of a year ago, of rye four 
and a half-fold, barley three, buckwheat four, cured 
beef two, frozen pork three, frozen fowls four. 

To the rising prices, then, have been due the 
swollen profits and the restricted real wages. To 
the rising prices are also due the occasionally ex- 
ceptional exactions of the monopolies. To the ris- 
ing prices again is due the unusual and excessive 
activity of speculators. But to what are due the 
rising prices? 

All the current glib talk about an increasing de- 
mand and a decreasing supply is sheer nonsense as 
explanation of a general rise in prices. It can be 
only an increasing supply of currency or a diminish- 
ing demand for it that can explain cheap dollars. 
General prices are a question of the ratio of the 
goods to be exchanged through the media of ex- 
change the volume of currency to the volume of 
the currency intermediate through which the 
exchanging is to be done. Only as relative to the 
volume of currency with which to buy goods can 
an increasing or decreasing general supply of goods 
affect general prices. To talk about the diminish- 
ing supply or the increasing demand of any one 
good is of use in explaining the rising price of 
that good. But it is a different matter for all 
goods taken together and set over against the money 
or currency through which, as medium and stand- 
ard, they are all to be exchanged. The ratio 
becomes then solely one of the total supply of goods 
to the supply of media. Only through a diminished 
supply of goods against media, or through an 
increasing supply of media against goods, is a rise 



in general prices to be accounted for. Excepting, 
indeed, in the sense of this ratio of the aggregate 
of goods to the aggregate of media for their ex- 
change, all talk of a generally increasing demand 
for goods or of a generally diminishing supply is 
incompetent as bearing on general prices. Goods 
exchange against one another, with currency serv- 
ing merely as intermediate. Thus it is only an 
increase in the supply of goods in general that can 
furnish an increase in the demand for goods in gen- 
eral and for an intermediate through which to 
exchange them. Demand for one commodity 
through money exists only 'by virtue of the sup- 
ply of other commodities offered for money. Sup- 
ply of one commodity is demand for other com- 
modities. An increased output of products involves 
an increase in the volume of exchanging to take 
place an increased general demand being merely 
a different way of reporting an increased supply. 
All supplies are demands and all demands are sup- 
plies the total output of goods reporting at the 
same time the total demand for goods and the total 
supply demand and supply being merely different 
aspects of the same commodities, according to 
the way they are thought of in relation to one 
another. When wheat is exchanging against shoes, 
either good is demand against the other, either is 
supply against the other. Exchanging goods are 
equally supplies against supplies or demands against 
demands. There is no such thing as a general 
shortage of goods relative to one another, or of a 
general increase of demand relative to one another, 
or _of a general rise in prices relative to one 
another. Goods in general can rise or fall in 
price only through the relation of the supply of 
goods to the medium through which as intermediate 
all get exchanged against one another. 

But the exchange of each particular good for 
another good divides into two steps. Instead of 
exchanging wheat for shoes, one sells his wheat 
for a price and with that price buys shoes. What 
is it that has made both the wheat and the shoes 
go up in terms of the intermediate? The demand 
for each particular thing presents itself in terms of 
money, the currency that other things were 
exchanged into, and that is now being offered as 
purchasing power for the particular thing. Why 
is more money now offering for each thing? Or, 
to push it a step back, why did all of the other 
things command more money when they were ex- 
changed into money, so that now more money is 
offered for each particular thing? In whatever 
way it is approached, the problem always finally 
presents itself as one of the ratio of the supplies of 
goods in general to the supply of the media of 
exchange, the price thing, the standard, the money

thing, the currency. Why is this thing becoming 
so relatively and increasingly plenty that it has to 
.go the way of all other things that get relatively 
plenty it gets cheap? Why does everything now 
buy more money, money less of everything? Why 
are general prices high? 

Most questions are half answered in getting 
rightly stated. The world production of goods 
has fallen. Even without a currency inflation, in 
the absence of any deflation, world prices would 
somewhat have risen. Our production probably fell 
off during the war. There was room in this for 
some small rise in general prices in America, even 
had we not inflated. Now, however, our produc- 
tion has become phenomenally great. But the fact 
that we are expanding our currency faster than 
we are increasing our production keeps prices still 
going up. The prices that rise faster than the 
costs leave the margins high, dividends generous, 
stocks booming. That costs are rising less rapidly 
than products is merely one way of saying that 
wages are not maintaining their purchasing power. 
Hence one of the stimulations to strikes. Even 
where wages have kept up with prices, the laborers 
interpret this higher money wage as due to them- 
selves, irrespective of the general .price situation, 
as rightly won and held on grounds of particular 
merit or good, fortune, and regard the concurrently 
rising prices as a malicious intervention to rob 
them of the vested rights of victory. The gen- 
eral equity breaks up into what seems a hydra- 
headed wrong. So again, the creditor class, the 
holders of the bonds and preferred stocks, the an- 
nuitants, the fixed salariat, and the commission- 
regulated folk, are all suffering, and wonder and 
gasp and pray where they are not intelligent 
enough to swear. The middlemen do their good 
best to keep in step with the upward swing of 
prices and lag not far behind. The speculator, 
making way as best he can at his double-headed 
problem on the one hand his adjustment of prices 
to relative future needs; on the other hand, the 
speculative lure of cheapening money brings 
earlier the rise in price that will be later due and 
thereby unduly restricts the supply of goods avail- 
able for present use. 

Meanwhile Washington busies itself with 
denunciations of the wrong man and with reme- 
dies for the wrong thing. Governor Harding ad- 
mits the inflation 32^/2 billions of bank deposits in 
1918 as against 18% in 1914, a 14 per cent increase 
in national bank deposits in the last year but thinks 
we can do nothing with it so long as prices keep 
rising; explains the inflation by the prices, not the 
prices by the inflation; and defends the inflation 
as a necessary policy in caring for business in view 



of the trend of prices. But what, then, did actually 
cause the rising prices? The rising costs? All 
along they have been lagging behind the prices, 
else there had been no widening margin of profits. 
The profiteers? They merely recognize the prices 
that are. The speculators? They recognize the 
forces behind the situation that will ultimately fix 
the prices. They are the servants of price 
merely accelerating what they foresee, bringing it 
earlier, and -preventing it from later going higher 
still. The Trusts? Their expanding gains are 
typical of business in general rather than excep- 
tions to it and are inconsiderable for the purpose 
of explaining the present situation. 

But what about the great demands from foreign 
peoples, who, lacking equally goods to use or goods 
to sell, appeal to us to sell them goods and offer 
only promises to buy with? They must also be 
contributors to our continuing inflation, as must 
likewise be every other demand, foreign or 
domestic, governmental or private, that gets dis- 
counted by the banks into circulating deposit credit. 
The price inflation is the direct and the certain 
result of the inflation of bank credit 30 odd 
billions of it now to do the exchanging that 18 
billions used to do. The rise in prices will not 
stop till the banks stop expanding their deposit cir- 
culation through extending discount or purchase of 
private and public obligations. And the banks will 
not stop till somebody or something stops them. No 
one of them can stop the others, and there is no use 
in any one's stopping if the others are to go on. 
Washington sees no reason for intervening siqce 
surely the banker must be informed of whatever pub- 
lic emergency exists. Governor Harding stands 
ready with the rediscounting facilities of the Federal 
Reserve Banks reserves being still redundant to 
supply to the limit of possibility such new reserves 
as the member banks may require for the further 
extension- of their accommodations and of their 
deposit liabilities. 

But fortunately this process, to which there is 
nowhere any human wisdom to prescribe a limit,

vency, it is their primary function to provide and

The Little Back Room 



O 



NCE BY MISTAKE I rented a little room in the 
Brown Borough, London, about the size of a billiard 
table. When I say by mistake I mean that my orig- 
inal object had been to rent a rather larger front 
room, which happened to be ideal for the Shop 
which I had in mind. It was only when the nego- 
tiations were far advanced and I was looking for 
a reason for the rather high rent demanded, that 
the agent broke to me the news that a little back 
room was inevitably included, like a baker's make- 
weight. It was a very dirty little, room indeed, 
looking out on to a backyard of such dirtiness that 
I could not write of it on this clean paper. The 
walls were freely perforated, there was no need to 
open the door in order to examine passing fellow 
lodgers in the hall. This was almost a blessing, in 
view of the fact that the window had forgotten 
how to open. Several of the window panes were 
made of wood instead of glass, which again had 
advantages, since wooden panes need no cleaning. 
Not that former lodgers had apparently wasted any 
energy on window cleaning; there was very little 
difference in transparency between the glass panes 
and the wooden ones. There were three missing 
planks in the floor of that room, and there was a 
fireplace which you could really light, if you were 
very careful not to disturb its balance. Of course 
if you lighted it roughly with a coarse wooden match 
and an ordinary tough Sunday paper it naturally 
fell out into the room. I don't know whether the 
game of Spellicans is universally known; I hope so, 
for I feel that the practice I have had in lighting 
my fire has given me a reasonable chance for the 
world's championship in Spellicans. My tongue 
sticks out yet a sign of exquisite caution when I 
think of building that fire. Only the lightest Even- 
ing News, skilfully shredded, would do, and fire- 
wood split and split again, and an edifice of tiny 
coals, and the most fairylike touch of a 
match. . . . 

" Pore people like dirt and bad repair," said the 
agent. " Why bless you, they wouldn't know them- 
selves without a bug or two in the wall to keep the 
'ome together and an 'ole in the winder to let in 
the sun to dry the clo'es by. Why I've known 'em 
come to me cryin' because there wasn't no vermin in 
the place for them to make pets of. Under the circs 
I might 'ave a lick or two of paint on the wood- 
work, and a yard or two of paper on the 'oles in 
the wall more than that I'm not authorized to 
see to." 

A few little square patches of seagreen paper were 
therefore pasted about my grey wall, as a conces- 



sion to the circs, and my table, chair, and bookshelf, 
which had been waiting expectantly elsewhere, 
moved in. I had left the back room as a blank 
sheet in my plans, as all my intentions were centered 
in the business to be born in the front room. I 
installed a table, chair, and bookshelf as articles 
sufficiently ambiguous for any development. 

Monsieur Jacques, the antique-chair maker in 
the basement of the house, who was a former friend 
of mine, met me on the threshold with much pride 
on the morning of my humble moving, to show me 
a wonderful patchwork of various coloured oilcloth 
which he had nailed all over my floor in the night. 
Some of the warmer coloured patches had almost the 
effect of sunlight on the floor. Monsieur Jacques was 
a good friend to me; the one flaw in our friendship 
was the fact that I was always finding myself en- 
tangled in his complicated family affairs. He had 
by some mischance acquired two wives, the first 
English, the second of his own race. The first, 
though she had 'indeed no wish to regain possession 
of him, was fond of employing me as a messenger 
in regard to the affairs of their son, a poilu in the 
French Army. Messages concerning this first fam- 
ily were anything but music in the ears of Monsieur 
Jacques, but he was always very patient with me. 
Sometimes the messages were of so heated and diffi- 
cult a nature that I committed them to paper only, 
and pushed them under the basement door. Mon- 
sier Jacques and I never referred to these by word 
of mouth; we met again with unbiased manners. 
The second Madame- Jacques, a lady who, I 
imagine, had never ceased talking long enough to 
learn any tongue but her own, never seemed to feel 
any coldness towards me as an intermediary, al- 
though the whole affair was known to her. My 
native Brown Borough friends could never take the 
French tongue seriously. They used to listen with 
benevolent smiles to the loud noise of Monsieur and 
Madame Jacques and me, talking all at once. The 
Babel was supposed to be a sort of concerted joke 
between us, and Monsieur Jacques' curious English 
was also accepted as a further example of his unfail- 
ing facetiousness. 

For the first few weeks I used my back room as 
an Arts and Crafts School. I happened to have a 
good many friends among applewomen, and other 
hangers-on of barrows in the city. Wartime and 
wintertime are bad times in which to be old and 
unskilled, times too when dry fruit is elusive game 
and yields good hunting only to the most agile. 
Now I had passed a certain amount of my young 
life in a schoolroom overflowing with handicrafts, 



292

and I was more or less skilled in the production of 
objects of a value artistically doubtful and commer- 
cially more than doubtful. Bazaars, however, afford 
tolerant custom, and custom that flourishes espe- 
cially in wartime. In these I put my trust. Into 
my little back room every evening I fitted, with 
jigsaw exactness, two old apple ladies, one young 
miscellaneous-barrow lady, one girl over school age, 
another just under, and occasionally a wounded 
coster soldier. All these people I instructed in the 
art of making baskets of a uniquely useless kind in 
raffia of many colours. The piebald walls of my 
little back room became saturated with song, scan- 
dal, the frequent sound of laughter, the occasional 
sound of tears, and other social intercourse. The 
senior " Granny " was often drunk and generally 
cheerful; the junior one always fresh and moist from 
some dreadful stroke of fortune ; the young barrow- 
lady almost too full of energy to be safely contained 
in the classroom ; the older schoolgirl bubbling with 
immoral anecdotes about the downing of parents, 
teachers, and guardians; the younger girl, aged five, 
industrious and cynical. The wounded soldier was 
too ill and too tired to contribute much to the talk. 
After a while the barrow business looked up again, 
and the non-barrow pupils became skilled enough 
to work alone at home, so my little back room was 
left empty. I let it as a lodging. 

My first lodger was Albert, nephew of Monsieur 
Jacques, also in the antique chair trade. His ten- 
ancy wasr short, owing to the fact that from the first 
he was wanted both by the military authorities and 
the civil police. Finally he disappeared with some 
nimbleness. Monsieur Jacques maintained a neutral 
silence on the subject of his errant relative, but 
Albert's mother, who was English, called to ask 
why the Shop (myself and partner) hadn't put the 
police on him right away, for " Though I ses it 
as per'aps shouldn't, Elbert's the most evil chap this 
side of the Mile End Road." She seemed to be 
rather unlucky in her children, for she came shortly 
afterwards to ask the Shop's advice as to what she 
should do with her daughter, aged fifteen, who, 
after " pushing in " the parental eye, had disap- 
peared. The Shop judicially asked what had been 
the girl's provocation. It appeared that the mother 
had simply threatened to lather her, calling her 

a , and had forbidden her to set her foot inside 

the door again. The Shop withheld advice. 

In the meantime the little back room was occupied 
by Miss Elizabeth M., a spinster with an almost 
alarmingly respectable past. Her present, however, 
was of a different character, and I first made her 
acquaintance at a time when, inspired by secret 



brandy, she had stormed my Shop, and played havoc 
with my property and my partner, who, being a 
cripple, had not been able adequately to defend 
herself. Miss M., on emerging from the lock-up, 
regretted this accident very deeply, and at her re- 
quest I prevailed upon her former employer to pay 
for a six months' visit to a Salvation Army inebriate 
home. On the day of her release from this excellent 
institution she celebrated the occasion by giving a 
little party to herself and a bottle of gin, after which 
she renewed the attack upon my Shop. But this 
time I was there. The noise of the argument be- 
tween the Shop and its caller drew quite a crowd 
to the window. The argument ended when we put 
Miss M. to sleep it off on the floor of my back 
room. When she woke up, sad and sober, she and 
I decided that she should be the next occupant of 
the little room, to see if its atmosphere helped her 
at all. It did not. She was drunk daily, although 
the Shop tried to distract her mind with lightsome 
talk whenever it saw her in the act of disappearing 
to the " London Apprentice." I called on the Sal- 
vation Army. A saint in navy blue told me that I 
was " one of little faith," which indeed I was, in 
the circumstances. The saint received the sinner 
again, albeit with arms a shade less open than 
before. As Miss M. disappeared, she winked be- 
hind the saint's back. The latest news of her is not 
inspiring. She sent for me to visit her in a Work- 
house Infirmary; she said that she was now saved, 
and was it true that the price of spirits had gone 
up again " outside." 

I forget the name of the next applicant for my 
back room, but I remember her face. I did not 
understand her expression and I did not under- 
stand her tactics. I did not like either very much. 
I never asked for references from lodgers, but 
this lady sprinkled me with little bits of paper in- 
forming me of the address of parsons and district 
visitors, none of whom, on being appealed to, could 
produce any information about her. Her explana- 
tion that they might have known her under other 
aliases did not seem to strengthen her case much. 
Again, I only asked for a very small rent, but the 
mysterious applicant, bent on arousing mv interest, 
showed me a little dirty bag containing thirty pounds 
in gold, which she wore attached to her neck. There 
was, of course, no gold in circulation in England 
then, and I tried to enlist the hoard in the war sav- 
ings service, but to no avail. While I was still won- 
dering whether I would place my innocent little 
room at the mercy of one so mysterious, she beean to 
move her furniture in. Among the rest of the fur- 
niture a husband, hitherto unmentioned, was in-

stalled. I protested against the secret and crooked 
appearance of these proceedings. Although she 
tried to reassure me by pointing out the happily 
impermanent nature of her domestic ties, I declined 
to be her landlady. I even turned the first detach- 
ment of her property out on to the sidewalk. She 
moved it back into the room. I removed it again. 
It was a battle of wills. Lodger and landlady wore 
a strong silent look about the house for some days, 
and then a stormy interview ended the transaction. 

My next lodger was a boy called Willy, aged 
sixteen, sent to the Shop by his employer who wanted 
to keep him out of the clutches of an undesirable 
mother. Willy paid his rent regularly, kept early 
hours, and seemed to be the ideal lodger. Then 
the Shop broke up for its vacation, leaving Willy 
a little money-box to put his rent into every Satur- 
day. The day before the Shop was due to resume 
business I received a courteous, if involved, letter 
from Willy, asking what he should do about the two 
families of kittens with which the Shop cats were 
apparently about to be blessed, as he himself was 
leaving before my return, taking with him the 
money-box for safety. I came back to find the back 
room empty but for a welter of starving cats and 
newborn kittens. Neither Willy nor the money-box 
was ever seen again. 

I then let the room to a lady called apparently 
Mrs. Mum. The name sounded somehow un- 
likely, but as she could not write, and could not 
remember ever having seen the name written, we had 
to take it on trust. She was a young broadfaced 
smiling person, with a laugh of stunning volume, 
and a two year old son called Charley. Charley 
had one joke. Like other humorists similarly situ- 
ated, he was helpless until somebody paved the way 
to his joke. Prompted by Mrs. Mum, the accom- 
modating friend would v say " Why, Charley, 
where's your Daddy ?" The reply, delivered in a 
succulent and triumphant voice was " Killing 
bluggy Germans." Mr. Mum I never met, but I 
acquired a sympathetic interest in him when I dis- 
covered that Mrs. Mum's behavior was modeled on 
the maxim that " a man in the hand is worth two 
at the Front." By unremitting effort the Shop 
managed to keep the image of the absent Mum 
fresh before his wife's "eye for six weeks, and then 
she and Charley eloped with a more accessible ad- 
mirer, after punctiliously paying their rent. 

My last lodger, the one who even now occupies 
the back room, has also been the most difficult. I 
have known Dolly D. for some years and she has 
this summer reached the age of sixteen. To call 
her half-witted would be perhaps unfair. Three- 



fifths witted might be a juster ^estimate. Most dogs 
can boast a better home life than that which the D. 
family enjoys. They lived six in one room, before 
Dolly left them. The father is never sober to my 
knowledge or perhaps he is sometimes, during 
sleep. The mother, although by incessant and heart- 
breaking work she manages to support her family 
on fifteen shillings a week (nearly four dollars), 
the fruit of painting toys with more or less unhealthy 
paint, is not really in full possession of her intellect. 
Dolly was never a worker. " Somehow," she says, 
" I'd just as soon do nothing as work," a not un- 
common feeling, which most of us occasionally try 
to overcome. Dolly had for the last two years 
possessed a young man, said to be as much as eighteen 
years old. I had thought him rather a fine boy, and 
had felt secretly sorry that romance should draw 
him along such an unpromising path. 

In due course Dolly " got into trouble." Her 
father, apparently feeling that he had given his 
children enough advantages to justify him in high 
expectations, righteously turned his daughter into 
the street. She moved into my back room without 
any possessions except two little framed seaside 
views. Such additional luxuries as clothes and a 
bed were left to the Shop to provide. It met the 
emergency by begging from its aunts. But on the 
subject of Dolly's future the Shop was for once 
divided against itself. My plan was that she should 
remain, a spinster, in seclusion in the back room 
until the " trouble" culminated in the hospital round 
the corner. But my partner was determined that 
Dolly should marry her boy., in spite of the fact that 
years of discretion and the normal allowance of wits 
were both obviously lacking. Dolly and the boy 
had no views on the subject, but after a few talks 
with a large number of neighbors, they did save up 
for a license, and, with the help of a few lies about 
their age, they got married. Immediately after the 
ceremony the boy broke to us the news that his real 
age was sixteen, and that he was only employed as 

a Boy Round The Docks, a profession not con- 
spicuous for its opportunities of advancement. The 
effort of getting married seemed to be too much for 
them. The husband at least now shows some energy 
in playing marbles with his friends on the side- 
walk, but Dolly, though in gooTl health, cannot 
even muster up enough vitality to enable her to 
hem the borders of necessary provisions laid in by 
the Shop against her future. She will not do up 
her hair or even dress herself, except in two sacks 
and a little string. The local authorities have 
offered her free meals, but Dolly would rather 
starve than dress up in her new Shop-provided 



294

clothes and walk two blocks to a good meal. The 
boy brings home a bloater at night, when his earn- 
ings run to it. 

When I said good-bye to Dolly, on leaving my 
Shop, she looked like a cave-dweller, wrapped in 
shapeless things and with her matted hair about her 
eyes. But I doubt if the cave-dweller would appre- 
ciate the comparison; after all he was progressive 
enough, in his own way. The march of civilization 
is not a particularly well organized procession; 
sometimes it almost seems as if the stragglers out- 
number those who keep in step. At any rate, in 



the Brown Borough most of us are content to linger 
on the long road, even though it be dark, and though 
there be no lights to lead us, and no flowers to make 
lingering worth while. In the van of the march 
the music brays confidently, wearying the ears of 
heaven with its brazen boastings of progress, but 
no echo of that music reaches us or cheers us, strung 
out wearily as we are along the forgotten miles. 

Perhaps Heaven only hears the boasting, perhaps 
Heaven has washed its hands of us, perhaps after all 
we are but dirt and deserve nothing better. 

STELLA BENSON. 



Service Accounting 



A HE TIME was, before America went into the 
war, and even as late as the day of the armis- 
tice, when to have the word democracy in a con- 
venient place in one's vocabulary was as good as to 
be a democrat and do democratic things and of 
course easier. This is not a blow at a President 
who is already busy enough dodging brickbats; it 
is the truth about all of us, all the idealists, all the 
dreamers, all the talkers and theorists, all the poli- 
ticians, all the a priori reasoners, all the Aunt Ples- 
singtons, Theodore Roosevelts, Woodrow Wilsons, 
Charles Edward Russells, Trotzkys and Lenins, 
the whole tribe, from light pink to violent red, who 
have been going into the silence to produce a 
theory and coming out of the silence to foist it 
upon an unregenerate civilization. The world has 
been full of talkers and disputants, without dirt 
on their hands or grease on the knees of their 
trousers, and without any conception of the in- 
finite complexities in which the wheels of produc- 
tion revolve. The attempt has been to apply ideas 
to industry instead of finding out what ideas in- 
dustry has been generating within itself. Democracy 
has been treated as a qualitative thing, whereas the 
only way to make democratic progress under the 
machine system is obviously to apply quantitative 
methods. What are the statistics of democracy, 
in dollars, hours, and units of product? Does it 
run counter to the machine system or in harmony 
with it ? Does the machine system, which is a blind 
instrument of production, tend of itself to breed 
democracy? If it does not the theories and the 
dreams will be of little avail. 

These reflections are induced by the reading of 
H. L. Gantt's little volume on Organizing for 
Work with which a new publishing house (Har- 
court, Brace and Howe) has made a promising 
debut. Mr. Gantt began by being, not a democrat, 



but first a manufacturer and then a production en- 
gineer. His theories are the residuum of workaday 
experience. He has an insatiable yearning for pro- 
duction; idle machines or men, inefficient fore- 
men and superintendents, wasteful methods in any 
department are his nightmares. If democracy in 
industry meant fumbling, confusion, and waste Mr. 
Gantt would be against it. Like Emerson and 
Taylor he preaches efficiency; and he is more con- 
cerned in proving that efficiency is democratic than 
that democracy is efficient. Yet he does both. In 
him and his increasing group of followers and 
if the word is permitted, parallelers the two 
schools which were parted at the time of the French 
revolution come together again. Handicraft bred 
its defenders of human rights, who were, after 
all, defenders of efficiency; now machine in- 
dustry has done the same. The instinct of work- 
manship and the instinct to be free, responsible, and 
self-respecting are again shown how to run in team. 
The reader of this little treatise will understand 
it better if he realizes that in going through it he is 
exactly reversing the mental processes of the man 
who wrote it. Mr. Gantt literally arrived, by way 
of shop, factory, and cost sheet, at his conclusions; 
the reader, perforce, must set out from them. What 
might be dogmatism in a theorist is a matter of ac- 
curate measurement with Gantt. The first princi- 
ple is neither new nor complex; it is simply that 
" reward should be dependent solely upon the 
service rendered." Here is a sentiment with which 
an orator may win applause from any audience, 
but as a sentiment it is worth even a little less than 
nothing. The Gantt method of industrial man- 
agement consists of an accurate and really 
effective system of applying it. When Gantt has 
charted a factory or an industry he knows, and 
everyone who can read a series of simple 



1919 



THE DIAL 



295 



charts knows, exactly how much every workman, 
every machine, every department, and if necessary 
every factory is doing, exactly how this compares 
with what each ought to be doing, and exactly how 
large a price ought legitimately to be charged 
against the product. His system enables those who 
use it to sort out the serviceable from the unservice- 
able. In so doing he puts a ringer on the crucial 
point in the price problem. " The "business man 
cannot continue to get big rewards unless he ren- 
ders a corresponding amount of service." More 
than that and this is where pure doctrine enters 
into the argument he cannot rightly receive any 
reward whatever for services not rendered. If 
he is unable to make use of more than one-third 
of his factory he may not ethically charge the con- 
sumer with the overhead charges on the other two- 
thirds. 

Our cost accounting system, to meet the present and 
future emergency, must not content itself with charging 
to the product all expenses, but must charge to the prod- 
uct only that expense that helped to produce it, and must 
show the expenses that did not produce anything, and 
their causes. 

This sounds harsh. Shall not the Steel Corpora- 
tion, running at two-thirds of its capacity, take 
from the consumer the cost of maintaining the 
other one-third in idleness? Can it remain solvent 
if it does not? Perhaps not, replies Mr. Gantt. 
If not let it perish of its own incompetence. Let 
us at least not reward incompetence by permitting 
men to capitalize and draw dividends from it. The 
rule is summed up as follows: 

The indirect expense chargeable to the output of a 
factory should bear the same ratio to the indirect ex- 
pense necessary to run the factory at normal capacity 
as the output in question bears to the normal output of 
the factory. 

If this were his sole contribution Mr. Gantt 
would have to be added to the innumerable army 
of worthy but rarely effective critics who have made 
the fairly easy discovery that the present system of 
production and distribution is immoral. But his 
belief that it is wrong to reward those who have 
rendered no service is secondary to his discovery 
that most men like to render service and can be 
shown how to do so, and to his evolution of a tech- 
nique which can Be but hinted at in a small book and 
only mentioned in a few paragraphs. It might be 
called service accounting, and on it something like 
that system of earned rewards of which all social 
reformers have dreamed might be made to rest. 
Even within the limits of this present and not nearly 
perfect generation it could easily furnish security 
and prosperity .for the factory owner with faith 



enough to apply it; indeed it has done so. Restric- 
tion of output is not a problem for Mr. Gantt. 
Workingmen in factories where his system has been 
installed do not diminish their product as their 
wages are increased. He says: 

With an efficient management there is but little diffi- 
culty in training the workmen to be efficient. I have 
proved this many times and so clearly that there can 
be absolutely no doubt about it. Our most serious trouble 
is incompetency in high places. As long as that remains 
uncorrected no amount of efficiency in the workmen will 
avail very much. 

Pursued to its logical limit service accounting 
scrutinizes not merely every factory but the rela- 
tions between factories and between all the ele- 
ments in production, and it will weigh even insti- 
tutions on its terribly exacting scales. The scientific 
credit system " must not only be able to finance 
those who have ownership, but also those who have 
productive capacity, which is vastly more im- 
portant." The rights of property must justify 
themselves (and there is no saying they will not), 
or, presto! there will be no rights of property. 
Privilege must be abolished, since it is in every case 
the privilege to be incompetent, or, which comes 
to the same thing, non-productive. 

The necessity in this instance is not political but 
economic. That nation which produces most has 
the best chance f<5r survival. If democracy is ef- 
ficient and efficiency is democratic that nation which 
is most democratic will have the best chance of 
survival. Here, if Mr. Gantt's conclusions are 
sound, is a new iron law. It is not a moral code. 
" Unless it can be shown," he declares, " that a busi- 
ness system which has a social purpose is distinctly 
more beneficial to those who control than one which 
has not a social purpose I frankly confess that there 
does not seem to be any permanent answer in sight." 
But: 

We have proved in many places that the doctrine of 
service which has been preached in the churches as re- 
ligion is not only good economics and eminently prac- 
tical, but, because of the increased production of goods 
obtained by it, promises to lead us safely through the 
maze of confusion into which we seem to be headed, and 
to give us that industrial democracy which alone can 
afford a basis for industrial peace. 

Others beside Mr. Gantt are upon the trail of 
these conclusions, though few have set forth so 
clearly all their implications. What if this be the 
destined way of progress, sure, steady, and almost 
independent of political revolutions and counter- 
revolutions? For men will not be enslaved under 
the machine system if the machines can be operated 
efficiently only when they are free.

Bolshevism and the Vested Interests in America 

I. ON THE DANGER OF A REVOLUTIONARY OVERTURN 



B 



OLSHEVISM IS A MENACE to the vested rights of 
property and privilege. Therefore the guardians 
of the Vested Interests have been thrown into a 
state of Red trepidation by the continued function- 
ing of Soviet Russia and the continual outbreaks of 
the same Red distemper elsewhere on the continent 
of Europe. It is feared, with a nerve-shattering 
fear, that the same Red distemper -of Bolshevism 
must presently infect the underlying population in 
America and bring on an overturn of the established 
order, so soon as the underlying population are in 
a position to take stock of the situation and make 
up their mind to a course of action. The situation 
is an uneasy one, and it contains the elements of 
much trouble; at least such appears to be the con- 
viction of the Guardians of the established order. 
Something of the kind is felt to be due, on the 
grounds of the accomplished facts. So it is feared, 
with a nerve-shattering fear, that anything like un- 
colored information as to the facts in the case and 
anything like a free popular discussion of these 
facts must logically result in disaster. Hence all 
this unseemly trepidation. 

The Guardians of the Vested Interests, official 
and quasi-official, have allowed their own knowl- 
edge of this sinister state of things to unseat their 
common sense. The run of the facts has jostled 
them out of the ruts, and they have gone in for a 
headlong policy of clamor and repression, to cover 
and suppress matters of fact and to shut off discus- 
sion and deliberation. And all the while the 
Guardians are also feverishly at work on a mobiliza- 
tion of such forces as may hopefully be counted 
on to " keep the situation in hand " in case the ex- 
pected should happen. The one manifestly con- 
clusive resolution to which the Guardians of the 
Vested Interests have come is that the underlying 
population is to be " kept in hand," in the face of 
any contingency. Their one settled principle of 
conduct appears to be, to stick at nothing; in all 
of which, doubtless, the Guardians mean well. 

Now, the Guardians of the Vested Interests are 
presumably wise in discountenancing any open dis- 
cussion or any free communication of ideas and 
opinions. It could lead to nothing more comfort- 
able than popular irritation and distrust. The 
Vested Interests are known to have been actively 
concerned in the prosecution of the War, and 
there is no lack of evidence that their spokesmen 



have been heard in the subsequent counsels of the 
Peace. And, no doubt, the less that is known and 
said about the doings of the Vested Interests dur- 
ing the War and after, the better both for the pub- 
lic, tranquility and for the continued growth and 
profit of the Vested Interests. Yet it is not to be 
overlooked that facts of such magnitude and of 
such urgent public concern as the manoeuvres of 
the Vested Interests during the War and after can 
not be altogether happily covered over with a con- 
spiracy of silence. Something like a middle course 
of temperate publicity should have seemed more 
to the point. It may be unfortunate, but it is none 
the less unavoidable, that something appreciable 
is bound to come to light; that is to say, something 
sinister. 

It should be plain to all good citizens who have 
the cause of law and order at heart that in such 
a case a more genial policy of conciliatory prom- 
ises and procrastination will be more to the pur- 
pose than any noisy recourse to the strong arm and 
the Star Chamber. A touch of history, and more 
particularly of contemporary history, would have 
given the Gurdians a touch of sanity. Grown wise 
in all the ways and means of blamelessly defeating 
the unblest majority, the gentlemanly government 
of the British manage affairs of this kind much 
-better. They have learned that bellicose gestures 
provoke ill will, and that desperate remedies should 
be held in reserve until needed. Whereas the 
Guardians of the Vested Interests in America are 
plainly putting things in train for a capital opera- 
tion, for which there is no apparent necessity. It 
should be evident of slight reflection that things 
have not reached that fateful stage where nothing 
short of a capital operation can be counted on to 
save the life of the Vested Interests in America; 
not yet. And indeed, things need assuredly not 
reach such a stage if reasonable measures are taken 
is avoid^ undue alarm and irritation. All that is 
needed to keep the underlying population of Amer- 
ica in a sweet temper is a degree of patient am- 
biguity and delay, something after the British pat- 
tern, and all will yet be well with the vested rights 
of property and privilege, for some time to come. 

History teaches that no effectual popular upris- 
ing can be set afoot against an outworn institutional 
iniquity unless it effectually meets the special mate-

rial requirements of the situation which provokes 
it; nor on the other hand can an impending popu- 
lar overturn be staved off without making up one's 
account with those material conditions which con- 
verge to bring it on. The long history of British 
gentlemanly compromise, collusion, conciliation, and 
popular defeat, is highly instructive on that head. 
And it should be evident to any disinterested per- 
son, on any slight survey of the pertinent facts, that 
the situation in America does not now offer such 
a combination of circumstances as would be required 
for any effectual overturn of the established order 
or any forcible dispossession of these Vested Inter- 
ests that now control the material fortunes of the 
American people. In short, by force of circum- 
stances, Bolshevism is not a present menace to the 
Vested Interests in America; provided always that 
the Guardians of these Vested Interests do not go 
out of their way to precipitate trouble by such meas- 
ures as will make Bolshevism of any complexion 
seem the lesser evil, which is perhaps not a safe 
proviso, in view of the hysterically Red state of 
mind of the Guardians. 

No movement for the dispossession of the Vested 
Interests in America can hope for even a temporary 
success unless it is undertaken by an organization 
which is competent to take over the country's pro- 
ductive industry as a whole, and to administer it 
from the start on a more efficient plan than that 
now pursued by the Vested Interests; and there is 
no such organization in sight or in immediate pros- 
pect. The nearest approach to a practicable organ- 
ization of industrial forces in America, just yet, is 
the A. F. of L. ; which need only be named in order 
to dispel the illusion that there is anything to hope 
or fear in the way of a radical move at its hands. 
The A. F. of L. is itself one of the Vested Interests, 
as ready as any other to do battle for its own 
margin of privilege and profit. At the same time 
it would be a wholly chimerical fancy to believe 
that such an organization of workmen as the 
A. F. of L. could take over and manage any ap- 
preciable section of the industrial system, even if 
their single-minded interest in special privileges for 
themselves did not preclude their making a move 
in that direction. The Federation is not organized 
for production but for bargaining. It is not organ- 
ized on lines that would be workable for the man- 
agement of any industrial system as a whole or of 
any special line of production within such a system. 
It is, in effect, an organization for the strategic de- 
feat of employers and rival organizations, by recourse 
to enforced unemployment and obstruction; not 
for the production of goods and services. And it is 
officered by tacticians, skilled in the ways and means 



of bargaining with politicians and intimidating em- 
ployers and employees; not by men who have any 
special insight into or interest in the ways and 
means of quantity production and traffic manage- 
ment. They are not, and for their purpose they 
need not be, technicians in any conclusive sense, 
and the fact should not be lost sight of that any 
effectual overturn, of the kind hazily contemplated 
by the hysterical officials, will always have to be 
primarily a technical affair. 

In effect, the Federation is officered by safe and 
sane politicians, and its rank and file are votaries 
of " the full dinner-pail." No Guardian need 
worry about the Federation, and there is no other 
organization in sight which differs materially 
from the Federation in those respects which would 
count toward a practical move in the direction of 
a popular overturn, unless a doubtful exception 
should be claimed for the Railroad Brotherhoods. 
The A. F. of L. is a business organization with a 
vested interest of its own; for keeping up prices 
and keeping down the supply, quite after the usual 
fashion of management by the other Vested Inter- 
ests; not for managing productive industry or even 
for increasing the output of goods produced under 
any management. At the best, its purpose and ordi- 
nary business is to gain a little something for its 
own members at a more than proportionate cost to 
the rest of the community; which does not afford 
either the spiritual or the material ground for a 
popular overturn. 

Nor is it the A. F. of L. or the other organ- 
izations for " collective bargaining " that come in 
for the comfortless attentions of the officials and of 
the many conspiracies in restraint of sobriety. Their 
nerve-shattering fears center rather on those irre- 
sponsible wayfaring men of industry who make up 
the I. W. W., and on the helpless and hapless 
alien unbelievers whose contribution to the sum 
total is loose talk in some foreign tongue. But if 
there is any assertion to be made without fear of 
stumbling it will be, that this flotsam of industry 
is not organized to take over the highly technical 
duties involved in the administration of the indus- 
trial system. But it is these and their like that 
engage the best attention of the many commissions, 
committees, clubs, leagues, federations, syndicates, 
and corporations for the chasing of wild geese under 
the Red flag. 

Wherever the mechanical industry has taken 
decisive effect, as in America and in the two or 
three industrialized regions of Europe, the com- 
munity lives from hand to mouth, in such a way 
that its livelihood depends on the effectual working 



298

of its industrial system from day to day. In such 
a case a serious disturbance and derangement of 
the balanced process of production is always easily 
brought on, and it always brings immediate hard- 
ship on large sections of the community. Indeed, 
it is this state of things the ease with which indus- 
try can be deranged and hardship can be brought 
to bear on the people at large that constitutes the 
chief asset of such partisan organizations as the 
A. F. of L. It is a state of things which makes 
sabotage easy and effectual and gives it breadth and 
scope. But sabotage is not revolution. If it were, 
then the A. F. of L., the I. W. W., the Chicago 
Packers, and the U. S. Senate would be counted 
among the revolutionists. 

Far-reaching sabotage, that is to say derangement 
of the industrial system, such as to entail hardship 
on the community at large or on some particular 
section of it, is easily brought to bear in any country 
that is dominated by the mechanical industry. It is 
commonly resorted to by both parties in any contro- 
versy between the businesslike employers and the 
employees. It is, in fact, an everyday expedient of 
business, and no serious blame attaches to its ordi- 
nary use. Under given circumstances, as, e. g., 
under the circumstances just now created by the re- 
turn of peace, such derangement of industry and 
hindrance of production is an unavoidable expedient 
of " business as usual." And derangement of the 
same nature is also commonly resorted to as a means 
of coercion in any attempted movement of overturn. 
It is the simple and obvious means of initiating any 
revolutionary disturbance in any industrial or com- 
mercialized country. But under the existing indus- 
trial conditions, if it is to achieve even a transient 
success, any such revolutionary movement of recon- 
struction must also be in a position from the outset 
to overcome any degree of initial derangement in 
industry, whether of its own making or not, and to 
do constructive work of that particular kind which 
is called for by the present disposition of industrial 
forces and by the present close dependence of the 
community's livelihood on the due systematic work- 
ing of these industrial forces. To take effect and 
to hold its own even for the time being, any move- 
ment of overturn must from beforehand provide for 
a sufficiently productive conduct of the industrial 
system on which the community's material welfare 
depends, and for a competent distribution of goods 
and services throughout the community. Other- 
wise, under existing industrial conditions, nothing 
more can be accomplished than an ephemeral dis- 
turbance and a transient season of accentuated hard- 
ship. Even a transient failure to make good in the 
management of the industrial system must immedi- 



ately defeat any movement of overturn in any of the 
advanced industrial countries. At this point the 
lessons of history fail, because the present industrial 
system and the manner of close-knit community life 
enforced by this industrial system have no example 
in history. 

This state of things, which so conditions the 
possibility of any revolutionary overturn, is peculiar 
to the advanced industrial countries; and the limita- 
tions which this state of things imposes are binding 
within these countries in the same measure in which 
these peoples are dominated by the system of 
mechanical industry. In contrast with this state of 
things, the case of Soviet Russia may be cited to 
show the difference. As compared with America 
and much of western Europe, Russia is not an in- 
dustrialized region, in any decisive sense; although 
Russia, too, leans on the mechanical industry in a 
greater degree than is commonly recognized. In- 
deed, so considerable is the dependence of the Rus- 
sians on the mechanical industry that it may yet 
prove to be the decisive factor in the struggle which 
is now going on between Soviet Russia and the 
Allied Powers. 

Now, it is doubtless this continued success of the 
Soviet administration in Russia that has thrown this 
ecstatic scare into the Guardians of the Vested In- 
terests in America and in the civilized countries of 
Europe. There is nothing to be gained by denying 
that the Russian Soviet has achieved a measure of 
success; indeed, an astonishing measure of success, 
considering the extremely adverse circumstances 
under which the Soviet has been at work. The fact 
may be deplored, but there it is. The Soviet has 
plainly been successful, in the material respect, far 
beyond the reports which have been allowed to pass 
the scrutiny of the Seven Censors and the Associ- 
ated Prevarication Bureaux of the Allied Powers. 
And this continued success of Bolshevism in Russia 
or such measure of success as it has achieved is 
doubtless good ground for a reasonable degree of 
apprehension among good citizens elsewhere; but it 
does not by any means argue that anything like the 
same measure of success could be achieved by a revo- 
lutionary movement on the same lines " in Amer- 
ica, even in the absence of intervention from 
outside. 

Soviet Russia has made good to the extent of 
maintaining itself against very great odds for some 
two years; and it is even yet a point in doubt 
whether the Allied Powers will be able to put down 
the Soviet by use of all the forces at their disposal 
and with the help of all the reactionary elements in 
Russia and in the neighboring countries. But the 
Soviet owes this measure of success to the fact that 



1919 



THE DIAL 



299 



the Russian people have not yet been industrialized 
in anything like the same degree as their western 
neighbors. They have in great measure been able to 
fall back on an earlier, simpler, less close-knit plan 
of productive industry; such that any detailed part 
of this loose-knit Russian community is able, at a 
pinch, to draw its own livelihood from its own soil 
by its own work, without that instant and unre- 
mitting dependence on materials and wrought goods 
drawn from foreign ports and distant regions, that 
is characteristic of the advanced industrial peoples. 
This old fashioned plan of home production does not 
involve an " industrial system " in the same exacting 
sense as the mechanical industry. The Russian in- 
dustrial system, it is true, also runs on something of 
a balanced plan of give and take; it leans on the 
mechanical industry in some considerable degree and 
draws on foreign trade for many of its necessary 
articles of use ; but for the transient time being, and 
for an appreciable interval of time, such a home- 
bred industrious population, living close to the soil 
and supplying its ordinary needs by home-bred 
handicraft methods, will be able to maintain itself in 
a fair state of efficiency if not in comfort, even in 
virtual isolation from the more advanced industrial 
centers and from the remoter sources of raw ma- 
terials. To the ignorant, that is to say, to the 
wiseacres of commerce, this ability of the Russian 
people to continue alive and active under the condi- 
tions of an exemplary blockade has been a source of 
incredulous astonishment. 

It is only as a righting power, and then only for 
the purposes of an aggressive war, that such a com- 
munity can count for virtually nothing in a contest 
with the advanced industrial nations. Such a people 
makes an unwieldy country to conquer from the 
outside. Soviet Russia is self-supporting, in a loose 
and comfortless way, and in this sense it is a very 
defensible country and may yet prove extremely 
difficult for the Allied Powers to subdue ; but in the 
nature of the case there need be not the slightest 
shadow of apprehension that Soviet Russia can suc- 
cessfully take the offensive against any outside 
people, great or small, which has the use of the ad- 
vanced mechanical industry. 

The statesmen of the Allied Powers, who are now 
carrying on a covert war against Soviet Russia, are 
in a position to know this state of the case ; and not 
least those American statesmen, who have by popu- 
lar sentiment been constrained reluctantly to limit 
and mask their cooperation with the reactionary 
forces in Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, Siberia, and 
elsewhere. They have all been at pains diligently 
to inquire into the state of things in Soviet Russia; 
although, it is true, they have also been at pains to 



give out surprisingly little information, that being 
much of the reason for the Seven Censors. The 
well-published official and semi-official apprehension 
of ar Bolshevist offensive to be carried on beyond the 
Soviet frontiers may quite safely be set down as an 
article of statesmanlike subterfuge. The statesmen 
know better. What is feared in fact is infection of 
the Bolshevist spirit beyond the Soviet frontiers, to 
the detriment of those Vested Interests whose guar- 
dians these statesmen are. And en this head the 
apprehensions of these Elder Statesmen are not alto- 
gether groundless; for the Elder Statesmen are also 
in a position to know, without much inquiry, that 
there is no single spot or corner in civilized Europe 
or America where the underlying population would 
have anything to lose by such an overturn of the 
established order as would cancel the vested rights 
of privilege and property, whose guardians they 
are. 

But commercialized America is not the same thing 
as Soviet Russia. By and large, America is an ad- 
vanced industrial country, bound in the web of a 
fairly close-knit and inclusive industrial system. 
The industrial situation, and therefore the condi- 
tions of success, are radically different in the two 
countries in those respects that would make the 
outcome in any effectual revolt. So that, for better 
or worse, the main lines that would necessarily have 
to be followed in working out any practicable revo- 
lutionary movement in this country are already laid 
down by the material conditions of its productive 
industry. On provocation there might come a flare 
of riotous disorder, but it would come to nothing, 
however substantial the provocation might be, so long 
as the movement does not fall in with those main 
lines-of management which the state of the industrial 
system requires in order to insure any sustained 
success. These main lines of revolutionary strategy 
are lines of technical organization and industrial 
management; essentially lines of industrial engi- 
neering; such as will fit the organization to take 
care of the highly technical industrial system that 
constitutes the indispensable material foundation of 
any modern civilized community. They will ac- 
cordingly not only be of a profoundly different 
order from what may do well enough in the case 
of such a loose-knit and backward industrial region 
as Russia, but they will necessarily also be of a 
kind which has no close parallel in the past history 
of revolutionary movements. Revolutions in the 
eighteenth century were military and political; and 
the Elder Statesmen who now believe themselves 
to be making history still believe that revolutions 
can be made and unmade by the same ways and 
means in the twentieth century. But any substantial 



300 



THE DIAL

or effectual overturn in the twentieth century will 
necessarily be an industrial overturn; and by the 
same token, any twentieth-century revolution can 
be combated or neutralized only by industrial ways 
and means. The case of America, therefore, con- 
sidered as a candidate for Bolshevism, will have to 
be argued on its own merits, and the argument will 
necessarily turn on the ways and means of produc- 
tive industry as conditioned by the later growth of 
technology. 

It has been argued, and it seems not unreasonable 
to believe, that the established order of business 
enterprise, vested rights, and commercialized na- 
tionalism, is due presently to go under in a muddle 
of shame and confusion, because it is no longer a 
practicable system of industrial management under 
the conditions created by the later state of the indus- 
trial arts. Twentieth-century technology has out- 
grown the eighteenth-century system of vested 
rights. The experience of the past few years teaches 
that the usual management of industry by business 
methods has become highly inefficient and wasteful, 
and the indications are many and obvious that any 
businesslike control of production and distribution 
is bound to run more and more consistently at cross 
purposes with the community's livelihood, the farther 
the industrial arts advance and the wider the indus- 
trial system extends. So that it is perhaps not 
reasonably to be questioned that the Vested Interests 
in business are riding for a fall. But the end is not 
yet; although it is to be admitted, regretfully per- 
haps, that with every further advance in techno- 
logical knowledge and practice and with every 
further increase in the volume and complexity of the 
industrial system, any businesslike control is bound 
to grow st-ill more incompetent, irrelevant, and im- 
pertinent. 

It would be quite hazardous to guess, just yet, 
how far off that consummation of commercial imbe- 
cility may be. There are those who argue that the 
existing system of business management is plainly 
due to go under within two years' time; and there 
are others who are ready, with equal confidence, to 
allow it a probable duration of several times that 
interval ; although, it is true, these latter appear, on 
the whole, to be persons who are less intimately ac- 
quainted with the facts in the case. Many men ex- 
perienced in the larger affairs of industrial business 
are in doubt as to how long things will hold to- 
gether. But, one with another, these men who so 
are looking into the doubtful future are, somewhat 
apprehensively, willing to admit that there is yet 
something of a margin to go on; so much so that, 
barring accident, there should seem to be no war- 



rant for counting at all confidently on a disastrous 
breakdown of the business system within anything 
like a two-year period. And, for the reassurance of 
the apprehensive Guardian of the Vested Interests, 
it is to be added that should such a break in the 
situation come while things are standing in their 
present shape, the outcome could assuredly not' be an 
effectual overturn of the established order; so long 
as no practicable plan has been provided for taking 
over the management from the dead hand of the 
Vested Interests. Should such a self-made break- 
down come at the present juncture, the outcome 
could, in fact, scarcely be anything more serious 
than an interval, essentially transient though more 
or less protracted, of turmoil and famine among the 
underlying population, together with something of 
a setback to the industrial system as a whole. There 
seems no reason to apprehend any substantial dis- 
allowance of the vested rights of property to follow 
from such an essentially ephemeral interlude of dis- 
sension. In fact, the tenure of the Vested Interests 
in America should seem to be reasonably secure, just 
yet. 

Something in the nature of riotous discontent 
and factional disorder is perhaps to be looked for in 
the near future in this country, and there may even 
be some rash gesture of revolt on the part of ill- 
advised malcontents. Circumstances would seem to 
favor something of the kind. It is conservatively 
estimated that there is already a season of privation 
and uncertainty in prospect for the underlying 
population, which could be averted only at the cost 
of some substantial interference with the vested 
rights of the country's business men, which should 
seem a highly improbable alternative, in view of 
that spirit of filial piety with which the public offi- 
cials guard the prerogatives of business as usual. 
So, e. g., it is now (September, 1919) confidently 
expected, or rather computed, that a fuel famine is 
due in America during the approaching winter, for 
reasons of sound business management; and it is 
likewise to be expected that for the like reason the 
American transportation system is also due to go 
into a tangle of congestion and idleness about the 
same time barring providential intervention in the 
way of unexampled weather conditions. But a 
season of famine and disorderly conduct does not 
constitute a revolutionary overturn of the established 
order; and the Vested Interests are secure in their 
continued usufruct of the country's industry, just 
yet. 

This hopeful posture of things may be shown 
convincingly enough and with no great "expenditure 
of argument. To this end it is proposed to pursue 
the argument somewhat further presently; by de>

Two Solitudes 



EAN'DE BOUSSCHERE is one who makes illimitable 
demands. But he exercise^ the same high discern- 
ment, the same strict excellence, in the magic of his 
gifts. Both axe to be found in his L'Offre de Plebs. 
The poem is a dialogue between the Misanthrope 
and Plebs, who comes to make his " off re unique," 
" mon offrande substantielle, c'est 1'ami." But the 
Misanthrope rejects him. Plebs promises all things: 
here is a friend who is a virgin and an atheist, who 
is faithful ("dix annees il cut un ami,") a friend 
who will be the Poet's slave. But the Poet, the 
Misanthrope, laughs with rage. And Solitude, who 
knows the heart of the Misanthrope, tells Plebs that 
he has lost. " Ton masque est plus cruel que mon 
panier!" says Solitude. The Misanthrope has the 
last word: 

Je ne veux pas d'un esclave; 

Je veux qu'il ait un Dieu. 

II faut que cela soit tnoi. 

Je veux d'un ami qui soit un Dieu. 

Et qu'il goute des memes herbes que moi, 

Et qu'il trempe ses mains au meme sang, 

Je veux qu'il me suive; 

Et qu'il embrasse ma tete coupee. 

Here is the inexorable perfection which genius de- 
mands. It is the cry of every artist. It is the 
simple, unanswerable desire of the seekers after 
reality in all its manifolds. 

The war, shaking to their roots the realities of 
our familiar life, stirred this ancient impulse. Con- 
temporary poetry is loud with the clamor for its 
satisfaction. Any preoccupation with imperma- 
nence is rather an acknowledgment of devastating 
change than of delight in seme frivolity or lament 
over a single lost beauty. Examine the recent work 
of such various men as Sandburg, Hueffer, and 
Aiken. These are individual and significant fig- 
ures; each represents not only a personal reaction 
but a distinct poetic tenor. Each dwells, with more 
or less passion and intensity, upon the escaping 
actualities of our life, upon the recurrent tides of 
war and empire, upon the vivid moment which dies 
in the hand that captures it. 

Those who stood aloof from the war, in the sense 
that they were involved in a personal struggle 
against it as bitter and disillusioning as any horrors 
of the trenches, were peculiarly fit to sympathize 



with de Bousschere's Misanthrope. Bertrand Rus- 
sell's philosophic detachment, Eugene Debs' isolated 
rebellion, however remote from the literary quarrels 
of the esthetes, yet bear a definite relation to the 
loneliness of him who wants a friend who is God, 
who declares with Solitude: 

Ne parle pas d'un homme qui ne soit beau, 
Ni d'un homme moins pur qu'une fleur fermee, 
Ni moins souverain que 1'image d'un palmier dans le 
desert. 

Something of this detachment, this rebellion, is 
expressed by James Oppenheim in his latest volume, 
The Solitary. The book is dedicated to Randolph 
Bourne, and more than a hint of this bitter-sweet 
anthem of death is to be savored in all the 
poems that follow. It will be remembered that the 
dedication appeared in THE DIAL for January II, 
1919; it is fairly typical, in its achieved lyrism, as 
well as in its striving after an authenticity that 
Oppenheim's too wistful rhythms barely evade. 

In hjs always engaging, if curiously uneven, out- 
put this poet is distinguished by three dominating 
interests. From the beginning, the ideal of democ- 
racy fascinated him. It is present even in the banal 
stories of his altruistic youth. His vision of it clari- 
fied and deepened, as did his feeling for the work 
he was doing; until the social worker emerges into 
the passionate propagandist, and the preacher into 
the poet. How far his democratic sympathies led 
him. toward Whitman, how far his adoration of that 
barbaric yawper fired the flame of his democracy, is 
not clear. Certainly the two currents flowing to- 
gether fed the stream of his poetic impulse. The 
second obvious influence is the rich Hebraic imagery 
in which he is steeped, and the more complete his 
surrender to it, the more glorious is his poetic fervor. 
Finally, but of enormous importance in any con- 
sideration of his development, is Oppenheim's abso- 
lute capitulation to the theories of the psychoanalysts. 
Among all contemporary American poets, Aiken in- 
cluded, there is perhaps no other so deeply intrigued 
by the work of Freud and Jung, especially the 
latter. 

Oppenheim's latest book does deviate from this 
supreme interest. The long opening poem, The 
Sea, which runs to over thirty pages, is a characteris- 



302 



THE DIAL

tic reiteration of the Christian, Nietzschean, Freu- 
dian doctrine of the lonely conquest, of the loss of 
the whole world to gain one's own soul, of the Soli- 
tary who can become part of the crowd only after 
he has been apart from it. 

Oh loneliness, who has sung your song, who has known 

your dark music? 
Only the stripped soul knows you, only the naked self 

has tasted your salt. . . . ' 

Fluid in its large resurgent rhythms, filled with a 
richer music than Oppenheim has attained hereto- 
fore, this somewhat too didactic poem is one of his 
finest achievements. The worst charge that can be 
brought against it is that its author's critical 
faculty is so unhappily far behind his creative power 
at its best. In spite of bombastic exaggeration, in 
spite of passages that astonish by their very dullness, 
The Sea is a fresh interpretation of an old miracle, 
a moving picture of the Solitary, looking " upward 
into the abyss " : 

Standing on two legs against the turning lump of Earth 
With upraised face against the wheeling of the worlds 

in unsheltered night . . . 
I, a man, stand as self-contained and solid in my 

littleness, 
As you, in your vastness. . . . 

Of the remaining poems, those contained in the 
section called Songs Out of Multitude hold most 
worth remembering. The recurrent elements ap- 
pear here again, most vividly and most powerfully 
in The Song of the Uprising, with its strong echoes 
out of the Psalms. Oppenheim is still the incor- 
rigible optimist, as witness his invocation to My 
Land. His solitude is alive with unhuman voices. 
He is not really a misanthrope, even though the 
friend whom he accepts is not the gift of Plebs, but 
rather his own selfhood, vocal and aflame with 
rhapsodic anticipations. 

This invaded and conquered loneliness of his, 
contrasted with Witter Bynner's Beloved Stranger, 
offers an illuminating paradox. For the latter poet, 
divorced alike from solitude and multitude in the 
lover's unique citadel, conveys a stronger sense of 
the ultimate isolation of the human spirit. The 
poems which originally appeared in Reedy's Mirror 
as Songs to an Unknown Lover have been pub- 
lished under the equally mystic title of The Be- 
loved Stranger. It is a commentary on the work of 
both Oppenheim and Bynner that the titles of their 
books might have been interchanged with little loss 
of meaning. The Solitary is nothing if not aware 
of a Beloved Stranger, be it his own soul, or the 
folk to whom he would confide it. Whereas 
Bynner's songs are the outcry of that profound soli- 
tude which the plummet of love itself only begins 
to sound. 



There has been more or less ironic questioning as 
to whether his latest work comes from the pen of 
the author of Grenstone Poems or from that of 
the intransigeant Emmanuel Morgan. In fact, 
what began as an esthetic jest over a ballet program 
and a cocktail bids fair to conclude as an esthetic 
program not a little intoxicating. These songs 
achieve what the Spectrists merrily toyed with. 
Within strict compass, moving in lyric rhythms, 
they are like prisms whose colors are the broken 
lights of the poet's emotion. Metaphors are as false 
as are generalizations. * The quality of these poems 
is due to the fact that they are not the beautiful, dis- 
torted fragments of emotional experience so much 
as they are concentrated reflections of it. 

There are several obvious faults. The images are 
not seldom so awkward as to be funny: 

The look in your eyes 

Was as soft as the underside of soap in a soap-dish . . . 

The straining for rhyme spoils or interrupts an 
otherwise lovely fluency. But these poems are at 
once incisive and wistful, reminiscent and provoca- 
tive. Such brief bright ecstasies as Singing: 

What is this singing that I hear 

Of the sun behind the clouds? 

It is not long before you shall come to me, 

Beloved. 

And that is the singing that I lean to hear 

In my side, 

Where your bird is. 

Such stop-short effects as A Sigh : 

Still must I tamely 

Talk sense with these others? 

How long 

Before I shall be with you again, 

Magnificently saying nothing! 

Such clear flashes as Lightning: 

There is a solitude in seeing you, 

Followed by your company when you are gone. 

You are like heaven's veins of lightning. 

I cannot see till afterward 

How beautiful you are. 

There is a blindness in seeing you, 

Followed by the sight of you when you are gone. 

These things are luminous evidence not merely of 
Bynner's firmer touch, and more lucid vision, but 
of that sense of echoes and overtones, of poignant 
simplicities and announcing silences, which is the 
secret of Oriental literature. 

Bynner's Beloved Stranger may be his lost mis- 
tress, or an unknown god. Whoever it is, it is one 
who gives him the perfection of withheld things. 
For the sake of that perfection, the artist must re- 
main the Solitary, owning no friend who is not 
comely, pure as a flower that is shut, and sovereign 
as a palm tree in the desert.

Wardom and the State 



IHE WAR HAS BEEN brought to an end, but war 
itself still threatens the remnant of our civilization 
with extinction. Before any other political problem 
can be seriously considered we must think through 
the difficulties which we so blandly neglected in the 
decades prior to 1914. We cannot rest content with 
a statesman's " peace " unless we are ready to follow 
that " peace " ta its inevitable conclusion another 
statesman's war. Upon this much we are all agreed, 
and the long shelf of recent books upon the prime 
problem of internationalism, the peace of the world, 
points to a preliminary unanimity which at the least 
is a common anxiety. 

But there are as many approaches to this problem 
as books. Thus Dr. T. J. Lawrence (The Society 
of Nations; Oxford University Press) takes inspira- 
tion from'the gradual growth of international society 
on the basis of international law. He sees the 
League of Nations as an instrument for carrying 
this process to higher levels of more conscious par- 
ticipation. In the whittling away of independent 
sovereignty as defined by the Austinians, Mr. 
W. T. S. Stallybrass (A Society of States; Dutton) 
sees the possibility of establishing genuine cooperation 
between states. Mathias Erzberger invokes the prin- 
ciple of compulsory arbitration as " the way to the 
world's peace " (League of Nations; Holt). Some- 
what nearer to economic fundamentals, H. M. 
Kallen relies upon the formation of international 
commissions for commerce, finance, armaments, edu- 
cation, hygiene, undeveloped countries, and labor as 
the means whereby a league of nations may operate 
against the sources of conflict (The League of 
Nations Today and Tomorrow; Marshall Jones, 
Boston). 

The conscientious attempt of these representative 
scholars and publicists to provide constructive ways 
and means for achieving international comity is 
wholly admirable. But beneath their several 
expositions is a common weakness: a refusal to 
examine the nature of states before discussing the 
terms of their pacification. They largely deny the 
efficacy of the statesman's peace, but they are not 
prepared to question the validity of the statesman's 
state. Because the state in modern times has been 
the unit that waged war, the political theorists have 
uncritically assumed that it is this unit which must 
be used in erecting the structure of a lasting peace. 
The League of Nations is to be a league of more 
or less sovereign states. 

It appears that at bottom our publicists have 
sought the best possible solution of this "quite 
insoluble and impossible problem " given a world 



of states to produce a peacedom from their united 
action. They have been in quest of a legal mechan- 
ism which shall absorb the shock of conflict between 
political institutions ever in danger of collision : they 
have not sought to establish the sort of political 
society in which the possibilities of collision would 
be removed. Peace has meant to the international- 
ist the absence of warfare in a world community 
constituted much like the present one. He has 
failed to see, as William James and Patrick Geddes 
and Thorstein Veblen have from various angles 
pointed out, that a society organized like the pres- 
ent one is constitutionally in a state of warfare. 
What we have ambiguously called peace is only pas- 
sive wardom. 

Now, one of the most potent sources of conflict 
between states is the nature of the national state 
itself. It is a limited territorial organization. It 
arose out of military conquest and perpetuated itself 
by command over military agencies. It claims the 
military allegiance of every person born within its 
frontiers, and it seeks to extend its frontiers in order 
to gain in" military strength by commanding the 
allegiance of the annexed population. With respect 
to other nationalities the national state is imperialist, 
for in order to integrate its own subjects it is com- 
pelled to disintegrate lesser nationalities. By a 
strange paradox, therefore, the national state is 
inimical to the principle of nationality. Even when 
the national state concerns itself with the support 
of commerce and industry, with the encouragement 
of the arts and sciences, it goes forward with a view 
to obtaining that mechanical unanimity of purpose 
which an Eastern observer, Tagore, has found to be 
the very attribute of Western nationality. Its immi- 
gration laws and its tariffs are assertions of exclu- 
siyeness. To restrict the free circulation of men and 
materials and ideas is the jealous privilege of the 
state, for it can maintain its own sacred union (in 
the face of an invading pack) only by resisting in 
times of " peace " those processes that work for 
generalization and universality. The state seeks to 
justify its own existence by denying the existence of 
a common humanity. 

The ability to enforce its privacy and exclusive- 
ness by force of arms is the very criterion of state- 
hood. This is what differentiates it from a city, or 
from an administration district. The inhabitants of 
Jersey City, for example,, could move en masse to 
the Bronx without stirring New Yorkers to any 
other activity than speculation in Bronx real estate. 
Should Tokyo move a single shipload of its citizens

to San Francisco the result would be armed conflict. 
Thousands of lives would be sacrificed to confirm 
the principle of sovereign, independent exclusiveness. 
" Keep yourself to yourself " is the essence of 
national statehood. It is the antithesis of the counsel 
of peace : " Be ye members one of another." 

It should be now a little clearer what makes the 
current projects for a League of Nations so abortive. 
So long as the component national states remain 
intact, the League can preserve its authority only by 
promoting the interests of each separate establish- 
ment. The partition of unorganized territories by 
mandataries witnesses this. Nominally the backward 
regions are to be under the surveillance of the 
league : actually they have been allotted on the basis 
of their seizure and occupation by separate national 
groups, precisely as though no league were to come 
into existence. Even where the guardian states do 
not stand greatly to benefit by control (if there is 
such a case) an equality of trading privileges is 
granted only to other members of the League. In 
this case it is plain that if the League have any 
political reality apart from the constitutions of the 
Great Powers this international state will have the 
same characteristics of an exclusive, territorial asso- 
ciation. Thus its members eschew to some slight 
degree the privilege of waging warfare among them- 
selves only for the purpose of obtaining dominion 
over the rest of mankind. Such a coalition will not 
rid the world of wardom. The underlying native 
populations of the subject territories are too large, 
too self-conscious, too disaffected, and in the end too 
powerful. Universal peace on such terms would be 
synonymous with universal exploitation. To break 
through the obscene crust of such an arrangement 
the volcanic eruption of war would be a welcome 
release. 

The state, then, is not an instrument adapted to 
international functions. Not until honesty can be 
produced in a world of thieves will peacedom be 
possible in a world of national states. To place 
reliance upon current diplomatic, military, and gov- 
ernmental agencies to create effective organs of inter- 
national intercourse and control is to discount our 
political hopes from the beginning and to put a pre- 
mium on disappointment. To allow these national 
establishments free play within a world organization 
will probably, as a few months of experiment already 
indicate, only broaden the area of conflict. In so far 
, as the league becomes a working institution it raises 
again on a large scale the problems of sovereignty 
and authority, the national aspects of which, Mr. 
Harold J. Laski has so brilliantly analyzed. 

Now there are no checks within the organization 
of the state upon its own powers and dispositions: 
the American experience with the checks and balance 



doctrine is exemplary proof. If we are to find a 
method of curbing the League from an attempt at , 
world dominion and world exploitation for the 
benefit of the several great powers we must utilize 
the same methods in dealing with the international 
organization as have proved valuable in dealing with 
the separate national state. We must employ, that 
is to say, the great industrial, professional, and civic 
associations deliberately to challenge the sovereignty 
of the state when it steps outside its purely pacific 
and administrative sphere. For in the growth of 
voluntary associations, linking across frontiers, lies 
the possibility of diminishing the strength of those 
compulsive military organizations which still, 
whether in isolation or in alliance, threaten the peace 
of the world. 

These voluntary associations divide into two 
classes: those that have, and those that do not have 
economic power. The second kind of association 
was thriving before the war; it comprised the scien- 
tific societies with international affiliations, the insti- 
tutes of hygiene, medical research, and town plan- 
ning; and the purely professional associations like 
those of lawyers, doctors, and so forth. The 
International Institute of Bibliography at Brussels 
was naturally deposited by the current of world 
interests which seemed visibly before 1914 to be 
bringing about a unity throughout western civiliza- 
tion. With proper encouragement it may yet 
develop as a world center for scholarly research a 
clearing house for the intellectual transactions of 
mankind. The great universities likewise, through 
their exchange professorships, were recovering some 
of that humane cosmopolitanism which characterized 
them at their best during the Middle Ages. What 
has been lacking so far is the definite and purposeful 
attempt to build up a community in thought and 
purpose which shall run counter to the narrow, 
partisan, incomplete, and ultimately military pur- 
poses of the national state. 

Associations for international contact and inter- 
course are necessary in order to supply a favor- 
able atmosphere in which the economic associations 
of the first type may function. Among the latter we 
may place the national trade unions like the British 
Triple Alliance, international unions like the Amal- 
gamated Ladies' Garment Workers, and consumers' 
associations of national range like the British and 
Russian Cooperatives. Within these several kinds 
of associations, with their deepening international 
affiliations and their growing realization of power, 
lies the opportunity for a truly federal world-organi- 
zation which shall begin with the local production 
or consumption unit and ramify outward in increas- 
ing disregard of formal national boundaries. It is 
obvious that current national divisions are inimical 



1919 



THE DIAL 



305 



to functional economic adjustments. The national 
state is out of joint with that Great Society whose 
framework has been erected during the past century. 
The Belgian worker who commutes every day to a 
factory in Lille where he works as an alien and 
retires at night to a village in Belgium where he 
sleeps as a citizen is surely an anomalous figure : but 
his position typifies the incongruity of industrial and 
political facts in the modern world. To abolish fake 
political divisions is the first step in building up a 
community in which the development of the arts and 
sciences of peacedom shall play a greater part than 
the maintenance of the military unity and the bellig- 
erent isolation of the national state. 

There is no short cut from the statesman's nega- 
tive " peace " to the active and positive state of 



peacedom. It requires more than a lawyer's cov- 
enant: it demands a new civilization. This new 
civilization must accommodate itself to the technique 
of the Great Industry. The national State works 
at cross purposes with the Great Industry, for the 
reason that it seeks to isolate that which is in fact 
the joint product of the world community. That is 
why, albeit the national state is strong, the communi- 
ties that have already passed beyond national state- 
hood, however incompletely like the United States 
and Great Britain are stronger. That fact will 
seal in the long run the doom of national states, with 
their almost rythmic alterations of passive and active 
warfare. And in the death of this military organi- 
zation lies the hope of a new order. 

LEWIS MUM FORD.

A Moment of the French Mind 



T is NOT ONLY THE WORLD that the Great War 
has divided in two. Its line of flame has cut across 
time as well as space, and given a new before and 
after to man's calendar of years. Already the events 
of a decade or two ago seem far and unfamiliar, and 
the books have already the quaintness of old-school 
things. It is presumably not a momentary mood; 
not merely the reaction to painful stress and to fierce 
absorption in abnormal aims and activities; not 
merely the disgust with old civilization through ex- 
haustion of emotion and intelligence in works that 
negate all civilization, paradoxically undertaken to 
save civilization. But the war has left us with new 
values, has created for us new centers of interest, 
not as yet altogether defined, coming to most of us 
for the present perhaps chiefly as a sense of estrange- 
ment from old values and interests. 

This deep division of before and after strikes us 
too in contemplating the lives of individual men. 
It has struck me particularly in reading Professor 
Lewis Piaget Shanks' study of Anatole France 
(Open Court, Chicago), as skilfully devised and as 
sympathetically written a " how-to-know-him " 
volume as one need hope for when psychological 
biography and literary interpretation of seventy long 
years must be compressed for the reader into twice 
seventy minutes. The Anatole France of Professor 
Shanks ends with the outbreak of the war. It is 
essentially a story of la vie litteraire: Anatole 
France is " the monk of letters." There are Rabe- 
lais, Racine, Voltaire, Renan, Leconte de Lisle, 
Flaubert in his fifty and more volumes for those 
wise in such matters a record of the literary forces 
dominant for the last half of the century in the na- 



tion whose name he bore with such symbolic pro- 
priety. There are Vergil, Lucian, and Sophocles 
with indeed, that same passionate response to the 
classics which so often has marked the Romanticists 
in letters, to the confusion of critics who have sun- 
dered apodictically the classical from the romantic 
spirit. There is the wistful charm of childhood 
essentially, though, of a literary childhood. There 
is the imaginative preoccupation with bygone ages 
in bygone crises of culture the Pagan-Christian, the 
Medieval, the French Revolution the delight in 
psychological reconstruction and artistic exercise. 
There is the skeptic and the Epicurean, likewise 
artistically conditioned as artist's matter of art as 
well as artist's matter of philosophy. There is the 
satirist of society, who, like Byron in Don Juan, 
mockingly employs his own earlier literary mediums 
as, for instance, historical tale and saint's legend 
for ironic criticism and fantastic burlesque. Pro- 
fessor Shanks has coordinated the curiously diverse 
phases of Anatole France's long literary activity 
with what must seem to us who have dwelt less 
with the master than he has a quite adequate analysis, 
a useful contribution to the study of personality, 
though here and there a significant detail of his 
make-up, like his propensity to sly sex-psychology or 
his quiet power to tickle us to a chuckle, seems not 
sufficiently stressed. It is a literary story of a shelf 
of golden books, of refined tastes and unerring taste, 
of art and artistry, of the brilliant dilettante who 
never tires of his own moods, his own fancies, his 
own pen. It is not the story of a fiery soul, gripped 
by the woe of the world or a prophetic vision of a 
new earth. The notes of artistic cleverness and 



306 



THE DIAL 



October 4 



spiritual frivolity, intermingled though they be with 
pathos and humor, and psychological thinking, are 
all but characteristic notes. Let one who demurs 
read France's Garden of Epicurus and then Nietz- 
sche's Human, All Too Human, each a volume of 
intimate meditation on " first, middle, and last 
things " to borrow the grim phrase of a seven- 
teenth century theologian. The exercise will almost 
bear out Arnold's insistence on the primacy of high 
seriousness in letters. Again, his was an individual- 
ism, a subjectivity, " the cult of the self." The 
phrase is Professor Shanks'; and in the same para- 
graph, the last in his book, he notes, as we are all 
noting, that " a new age is upon us, an age whose 
first reaction will be toward Life." 

This was the Anatole France whom they elected 
to the Academy. But he had begun to change as 
of course Professor Shanks has remarked before 
the great dividing years. He had begun to find 
new uses for old gifts, as his life-long insight into 
sham and shams, his intimacy with history, his ten- 
derness and mirth, his craftsmanship in phrase 
deepened in their ethics and broadened in their 
humanity. He had begun to feel the terrific forces, 
rumbling through Europe before the earthquake 
perhaps from the day when he left his 'golden books 
to stand in the market place for justice and Drey- 
fus, beside Emile Zola, whom he called " un mo- 
ment de la conscience humaine." That phrase, like 
the shot at Concord, was heard roupd the world. 
And now when we think of Anatole France, we 
think not of the Academy or the salon or the book- 
stalls on the Quay, but of the shouting streets of the 
metropolis, down which march the workers, honor- 
ing Jaures dead in their midst the grey old man 
whose lips have been touched, like Isaiah's and 
Whitman's, with living fire. 



For he is now become the voice of -France. 
Clemenceau, that other old man, has redeemed his 
vow of forty years ago. Foch hoists the tricolor 
that flaunts in the winds that blow toward the 
Rhine. The Bourse obtains new markets for old. 
But neither Clemenceau, nor Foch, nor the Bourse 
is the voice of France. Anatole France is the voice 
of France, and a new and nobler symbolism crowns 
the nom-de-plume of fifty years. Hear a few words 
of that voice, as it rang out at the Congress of 
Teachers' Institutes at Tours in August, reported 
in I'Humanite, and translated in The Nation: 

No more industrial rivalries, nor more wars: work 
and peace. Whether we wish it or not, the hour is come 
when we must be citizens of the world or see all civiliza- 
tion perish. My friends, permit me to utter a most ardent 
wish, which it is necessary for me to express too rapidly 
and incompletely, but whose primary idea seems to me 
calculated to appeal to all generous natures. I wish, I 
wish with all my heart, that a delegation of the teachers 
of all nations might soon join the Workers' Internationale 
in order to prepare in common a universal form of edu- 
cation, and advise as to methods of sowing in young 
minds ideas from which would spring the peace of the 
world and the union of peoples. 

Reason, wisdom, intelligence, forces of the mind and 
heart, whom I have always devoutly invoked, come to 
me, aid me, sustain my feeble voice ; carry it, if that may 
be, to all the peoples of the world, and diffuse it every- 
where where there are men of good will to hear the 
beneficent truth! A new order of things is born. The 
powers of evil die, poisoned by their crime. The greedy 
and the cruel, the devoifrers of peoples, are bursting with 
an indigestion of blood. However, sorely stricken by 
the sins of their blind or corrupt masters, mutilated, deci- 
mated, the proletarians remain erect; they will unite 
to form one universal proletariat, and we shall see ful- 
filled the great socialist prophesy: the union of the 
workers will be the peace of the world. 

Has he not become, too, the voice of all nations:? 
Or shall we in America fail to hear still pleasantly 
hypnotized by a voice we have too dearly loved and 
too faithfully believed?

The clouds across the mountains swept up like chariots of the Lord ; 

The little strawberry-breasted linnets sang hallelujah! hallelujah! 

The sagebrush flowered praise. 

" Jesus is coming! Jesus is coming 1 " 

Said the black paint against the side of the pot as he walked. 

Then one day he saw where someone else had written 

" The wages of sin is death," 

And considering it, he lost touch with his revelation 

And straightway the universe was strewn with the wrecks of his paradise

The Old Order and the New 



IT IS REPORTED THAT BOSTON'S COMMISSIONER 

Curtis gave the policemen to understand, when they 
filed their complaints and demands, that it was a 
matter of comparative indifference to him whether 
or not they struck; that he was the man who was 
responsible for public safety in Boston and he would 
show them and the city that he was competent to 
fulfill the duties of the office without their assistance. 
We have not verified the report that such a confer- 
ence between the Commissioner and the men took 
place, but the conduct of the Commissioner verifies 
the conception that the only responsible office in the 
Department of Public Safety is the office of Com- 
missioner. We have learned that the direct or 
immediate event which precipitated the strike was a 
bill introduced in the Massachusetts legislature at the 
instigation of Commissioner Curtis, denying police- 
men the right of review in case of transfer or dis- 
charge. The bill gave the Commissioner autocratic 
power over the administration of public safety, 
which could not be questioned by a member of the 
force except under the penalty of discharge. In a 
very thorough fashion the Commissioner undertook 
to live up to the reputation of responsibility which 
was attached to his office. The policemen also 
carried out in thorough fashion the tradition of 
irresponsibility attached to the office of wage earner; 
the public is under obligations' to the Boston Com- 
missioner for bringing out in clear relief that this 
office, whether manned by men in public or private 
service, is one of irresponsibility. A wage earner 
may be fired or may quit his job without disconcert- 
ing an industry or a service ; cither can get on with- 
out him and suffer no serious loss and in any case 
its getting on is no concern of his. He is paid to 
do a specific job; the continuation of that job, its 
interruption, its assignment are distinctly matters 
that some one else must determine. His worry- 
ing over the job availeth nothing; then why 
should he worry? Why should any of the workers 
worry, when there are special men who have 
assumed the job of worrying, or others who have 
been deputized to do the worrying for the boss? 
The worrying job, like riveting bolts, under the 
modern scheme of dividing labor is specially assigned 
and provided for in any well-organized scheme. And 
woe to the riveting man who steps across the line. 
Moreover we may believe the boss and his deputies 
when they say that they take their worries home,' 
that they cannot sleep at night for worrying. Who 
would not worry if he had in charge a small or a 



large group of men who had been hired on the 
explicit condition that they were there to attend to 
nothing except the detached end of the enterprise 
assigned them; men who were there on the under- 
standing that the relation of their job to others, its 
value in the enterprise, and the conduct of the enter- 
prise as a whole were matters in which their judg- 
ment was ruled out? 



IT IS THE FIRST SIGN OF DAWN THAT WAGE 

earners are beginning to suspect that bearing respon- 
sibility must be a diverting as well as a lucrative 
pastime, since those who assume the position hold to 
it with peculiar tenacity. In no case are they ready 
or eager to share. Sharing responsibility with the 
worker is the last bit of ground that the governing 
class will surrender. Before employers will recede 
so far they will pay union wages, adopt the closed 
shop, share their profits, and submit to government 
" interference." The proposition of the railroad 
workers for the administration of transportation 
along the lines of functional responsibility is the 
present challenge to the trades unions and the labor 
world that the time has come for the adoption of a 
new industrial policy, a policy of labor responsibility 
in productive service. The experiment in the United 
States arsenals as well as the cooperative experi- 
ments abroad, in agriculture in Italy and in other 
industries elsewhere, have already demonstrated that 
common laborers in conjunction with production- 
technicians might be entrusted, with high profit to 
themselves and the community, with full responsibil- 
ity. It happens that railroad transportation is so 
organized that the trust could be transferred at once 
with immediate returns to all ; it is also evident that 
a few other highly organized industries are overripe 
and waiting to be taken up; that practically all 
municipal, state, and federal- activities could be 
rescued from the corruption of political administra- 
tion and the service vastly improved if the employees 
made themselves responsible for the service as a 
whole. As wage earners with few exceptions refuse 
to assume the responsibility, what can and cannot be 
rescued is beside the point. But it is clear to the 
whole world that the labor-union movement has 
reached a place where a new policy, a policy of 
industrial responsibility, must be adopted if the 
union is to continue to function; and that the day 
of the collective bargain must make way sooner or 
later for the day of the collective contract.

SHOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST TO THE UNIONS 

that they may well begin at once to prepare for a 
time when industrial responsibility can be trans- 
ferred to men who are technically competent begin 
by throwing the responsibility for strikes back on 
the shoulders of employers, who under present 
arrangements hold the position of responsibility for 
production and public service. Let us take up some 
of the issues which arise in industrial relations 
wages, hours ; and, at times, economy in adminis- 
tration. First, the case of wages. The organized 
workers of a shop, when considering wage rates, 
might send their representatives to the boss to 
inform him that they were in search of facts, that 
they were in the dark as to costs and the financial 
resources of the enterprise, and that they could not 
consider the question of wages intelligently unless 
they had access to all the financial data possessed by 
the management. It is needless to observe that the 
request for light would be refused as an untoward 
impertinence; but the refusal of men to continue 
working without light would have a retroactive 
psychological effect on the present processes of indus- 
trial manipulation which would be altogether bene- 
ficial. In the case of hours of work, the employees, 
without the assistance of the boss, but with the help 
of the production expert, could make a study of 
short and long shifts. Other questions of production 
organization, such as a new coordination of the 
working forces in the shop, a new method of routing, 
a better selection of material, the possibility of buy- 
ing and selling in other markets, new methods of 
accounting, would inevitably become shop issues if 
the workers assumed the position of production 
responsibility. 

Having made their studies and drawn their plans, 
the workers should submit them to the test of pub- 
licity and examination. Convinced of the validity 
of their conclusions, they would be prepared to act 
on them; to work on the hour schedule which they 
had determined was best for all concerned; to put 
into operation the methods of shop organization 
which they believed experience would prove alto- 
gether good. They would not, of course, get beyond 
the presentation of their case before they would find 
themselves on the street. That however is where 
the unions are at home in case of an issue. The 
difference between the new method and the old 
would be that the workers would have a case of 
particular interest to the public, instead of a case of 
special interest to a comparatively small group of 
men. Moreover if, instead of striking, they under- 
took actually to put into operation a scheme of 
organization which promised increased economy and 
better service, they would be on the street because 
the owner of the plant had locked them out. The 
fight of organized workingmen for more light, for 
responsibility, for an intelligent and highly efficient 
service would be met as the manufacturers are now 
meeting the effort of the workers in the arsenals. 
It is a dangerous precedent, the manufacturers 
declare, for the workers to be given responsibility, 



for them to use their intelligence, for them to under- 
bid business. A Senate investigation is demanded. 
In a short time the arsenal experiment will be killed 
and the government will subserviently pay the price 
for optics, saddles, and so forth which responsible 
business men in their infinite wisdom pronounce to 
be just and good. They may kill the experiment in 
the arsenals, but they cannot kill the once-aroused 
desire of labor to function productively. If that 
desire is to assert itself in the near future the burden 
of preserving labor's irresponsibility will have to be 
borne by the politicians and the business men. Let 
us suppose, for instance, that a city's firemen, well 
organized for purposes of assuming the responsibility 
of fire prevention, undertake to introduce a scheme 
for improving team work in the fighting of fires, and 
that the Fire Commissioner discharges them for 
their pains. The Commissioner, not the firemen, is 
responsible for the prevention and control of all fires 
during the period of the lockout. If, instead of 
striking, the Boston police had taken in hand the 
administration of the Police Department, Commis- 
sioner Curtis, with the assistance of the militia, 
would have locked them out, and would have 
appeared before the public as incompetent as he 
actually is to assume the responsibility for Boston's 
safety. We submit for the consideration of all 
intelligent laboring men the proposition that there 
is no better time to begin preparation for the assump- 
tion of responsibility than now, when the whole 
world is sensing the fact that those who now hold 
responsible office in the nature of the case do so on 
bluff. While the present situation is fostered by 
keeping the mass of men in the position of irresponsi- 
bility for quality and quantity in output and service, 
strikes are inevitable. While this situation endures, 
the question of the right of men to strike is 
immaterial, and the ethical query as to whether or 
not strikes of public employees should be supported 
is impertinent. . 



IT WILL TAKE A COMPLETE VICTORY FOR REACTION 

in Russia to prove to all parties that the only thing 
the anti-Bolshevists have in common is anti-Bol- 
shevism. Nevertheless there are already in hand cer- 
tain items of evidence that point to this conclusion. 
As far as the anti-Bolshevists are pro-anything, they 
are pro-private-property. With the menace of social- 
ization once out of the way, the business of being 
pro-private-property will lose its significance, for the 
time being at least, and all the divisive tendencies 
now submerged by the Great Fear will show up 
again. In this connection it may be noted that besides 
being a reactionary, Kolchak is an imperialist. And 
it is precisely at the moment of reaction's triumph 
that imperialism will become really significant. In 
the matter of Ukrainja, for instance. It is reported 
now that Ukrainia has abandoned her political inde- 
pendence and- has decided to leave to the much 
promised All-Russian Constitutional Assembly the 
matter of settling her final status. Can there be 



1919 



THE DIAL 



309 



any uncertainty as to what the Assembly's decision 
will be? Or any hope that Ukrainia, having once 
tasted freedom, will abide by this decision? The 
ultimate answer is not far to seek. Nor will Deni- 
kin's deal with Petulra, the Ukrainian chief, be 
without its effect in the Baltic region, where a fed- 
eration of new states has opened negotiations with 
the Soviet Government. Under these conditions, is 
there any possibility that Lithuania, Lettvia, and 
Esthonia will eventually vote themselves into Kol- 
chak's empire for the privilege of fighting Kolchak's 
battles? Finland's aloofness has established a dif- 
ferent precedent. And as for Kolchak's imperial 
retainers: Will Japan demand all of Siberia or 
half? Will the Trans-Caucasian provinces recom- 
pense France for the loss of much-coveted territory in 
Asia Minor ? And will England be satisfied with the 
Baku oil region the natural hinterland of Mesopo- 
tamia and Persia or will Russian Turkestan be- 
come a necessary buffer for Persia and Afghanestan ? 
What about the Murmansk coast, where Americans 
landed to save war-material from the Bolsheviki, 
and found that they were expected to carve up Rus- 
sia for the British? To what lengths of cruelty 
must Kolchak go to maintain himself in that portion 
of Russia which foreign forces conquer for him and 
are generous enough to leave to him? If history and 
logic mean anything, they mean that the triumph of 
Kolchak will bring not only the destruction of indus- 
trial democracy in Russia but the partition of the 
nation itself among the spoilsmen now joined in the 
service of reaction. 

AHE WAR THAT BINDS TOGETHER THE PARTISANS 

of Kolchak has likewise served the interests of gov- 
ernmental centralization in Soviet Russia. Victory, 
whether it comes to Lenin or to Kolchak, will entail 
not only the elimination of the defeated leader, but 
the partial or complete disintegration of the forces 
of the champion. To choose intelligently between 
the one triumph and the other is to choose between 
two types of confusion with an eye to ultimate 
results. With Kolchak once in power, wars with 
the small nations and quarrels with imperial allies 
will create a condition of affairs exactly suited to the 
maintenance of a reactionary regime. Victory will 
turn the Dictator's allies into enemies, and throw 
upon Russia a burden of foreign complications that 
can be met only by a highly centralized and militar- 
ized government. The pro-Bolshevist alliance on 
the other hand is made up of men of many parties 
held together for, the time being by a common fear 
and hatred of reaction. The only answer of these 
pro-Bolshevists to criticisms of the severe and dicta- 
torial methods of the Bolsheviki is the answer of the 
French Revolution Fatherland in danger ! During 
the last two years America herself has seen what 
an unreasonable measure of power the authorities 
may assume in the face of war. And for us at our 
safe distance the war was hardly worthy of com- 
parison with the rending horror that has attached 



itself to the body of Russia. Any truly logical 
believer in Bolshevism at its worst should be 
highly pleased with the measure of Allied help 
now extended to Kolchak just enough to make 
the Bolshevist dictatorship necessary, to maintain 
violence at the frontiers and justify violence at the 
capital. Once relieved of Allied pressure, the Soviet 
Government could probably compose its differences 
with the small nations and completely crush the 
Kolchak forces in six months. Then, with peace, 
the pro-Bolshevist group would fall apart into its 
elements not quarreling nations or jealous empires, 
but political and economic parties, aroused to intens- 
est activity by the socialization of property, concerned 
almost entirely with the problems of industrial and 
political democracy .... Disintegration? 
Yes the eager confusion that means progress. 



T, 



HE PRESIDENT HAS TOURED THE COUNTRY. HE 

has spoken a great many times, but he has not added 
to our stock of knowledge. He has asserted that 
the League of Nations is as harmless as a lamb, but 
he has not bothered to prove it. Why? We do not 
know. We want to be shown. On the one hand 
the President reproaches us for not wishing peace as 
ardently as himself. On the other he appoints 
Judge Gary and Mr. Rockefeller to represent the 
public at his industrial conference of October 6. 
Some lesser lights, mostly from the banking fra- 
ternity, and two renegade Socialists complete the list. 
Of them all and there are twenty-two only Ex- 
President Eliot and Mr. Gay inspire confidence. 
Now at last we know the names of the persons 
President Wilson has in mind when he tells us that 
he voices the sentiments of the American people 
about peace or the League or anything else. We 
have only one fear: with the capitalists all pledged 
to support the public interest, who will look 
after the just claims of capital? We note that the 
ablest labor leaders have not been snatched away 
from their personal interests and impressed into the 
service of the general public ; and we recommend for 
careful consideration the sacrifice the President has 
required of the largest employers of labor in the 
United States. But our Administration is not con- 
tent even with this display of its hand in the indus- 
trial game. Against all the aces and all the trumps, 
what can one do? Secretary Baker has endorsed 
General March's plea for a standing army of half a 
million men, and compulsory training for all the 
youth of the country. The President's friends report 
that he approves the plan. This indicates the kind 
of peace that is to follow the signing of the Treaty. 
General March's argument that universal training 
will ensure peace sounds strangely familiar. If we 
remember rightly, it was " made in Germany." 
There even comes now the report that our navy has 
outstripped the British. And Japan is wrought up 
over the naval demonstration in the Pacific. We 
slide and slide whither? Is it towards the better 
world for which we fought?

Casual Comment 

A DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHICH 
sought to promote international understanding 
would be a diplomatic anomaly. But a journal of 
this name came into existence lately, and that is its 
avowed purpose. It is the official organ of the 
Union of Democratic Control, a British organiza- 
tion which numbers on its executive committee such 
names as J. A. Hobson, Charles Trevelyan, and C. 
Roden Buxton. In its anti-imperialism and its anti- 
militarism Foreign Affairs is in the direct line of the 
Victorian liberal tradition one remembers Hob- 
son's sympathetic study of Cobden, the Internationa] 
Man (reviewed by Robert Morss Lovett in THE 
DIAL for April 19) but the Union of Democratic 
Control has added to its corporate policy the social- 
ist bias of the later Victorian period, that of Messrs. 
Macdonald and Snowden. The September issue of 
Foreign Affairs contains articles by the Austrian, 
Friedrich Hertz, the Korean, K. Lee, and the Eng- 
lishmen, Trevelyan, Pensonby, and Murray. In 
the article of Murray in defense of pre-war 
diplomacy lies the promise of a vigorous contro- 
versy, while the varied nationalities of the other con- 
tributors is an earnest- of Foreign Affairs' desire to 
act as a clearing house for international political dis- 
cussion. The condemnation of the Covenant in its 
present form by the executive committee of the 
Union of Democratic Control proves, in spite of the 
tameness of the British labor parliamentarians in 
accepting the Treaty, that liberal forces abroad are 
no less keenly aware of the defects of the present ar- 
rangements than we are, even if they have proved 
less effective in opposition. The Union allies itself 
boldly with the Clarte group in France, which is 
soon to issue a monthly review, and thus it forms 
the intellectual base for a persistent and unified 
movement against those national forces whose chief 
purpose seems to be that of working at cross pur- 
poses with other nationalities. Left to themselves 
these peace organizations would probably not be 
more effective than those of Cobden 's period; but 
the Union is deliberately seeking the support of 
labor groups, and is thus gaining a powerful ally of 
which the capitalist bias of Cobdenism, and the 
weakness of mid-Victorian workers' associations, 
robbed the earlier movement. 



HAT LITERATURE, AND PARTICULARLY POETRY, 

has gained from the war may be footed up by our 
children: of what it has lost we have the evidence 
all about us. Walter Adolphe Roberts is one of the 
poetic craftsmen whose promise it has, so far, al- 
most canceled. He has no little ability; if inclined 
to be facile, he is always metrically sound; without 
marked originality, he nevertheless has a keen feel- 
ing for the appropriate word. But to make litera- 



ture out of the war, one must either have been dis- 
passionately above the tumult, like Remain Rolland, 
or in the midst of it, like Nichols and Sassoon and 
Aldington. Mr. Roberts was neither; the war 
came to him, as to most of us, strained through 
the censorship. In Pierrot Wounded, and Other 
Poems (Britton) it is France heroic and embattled 
that he has tuned his lyre to sing. The impulse 
which he has followed had similar results on poets 
as dissimilar as Amy Lowell and Lurana Sheldon, 
the bard of the Times editorial page. This much 
however is individual to Mr. Roberts that the 
France which he loves is the nation of eternal re- 
volt. The war itself he envisages as another Com- 
mune, a revolt of democracy against the White 
Terror of the Kaiser, and he adjures the armies 
as stout revolutionaries to " tear up stones for the 
barricades." It is indeed true that Revolutionary 
France was at war with Germany. The disillusion 
of a reactionary victory however has put Pierrot 
Wounded a trifle out of date. Published three 
years ago, when the country was ringing with Ver- 
dun, and Clemenceau was editor of an Opposition 
paper, it would have been an immediate success. 



A FALLACY LONG ENDEMIC IN THE MINDS OF 

American artists and public alike is that one must 
go to France to learn to paint. The student re- 
turns home spoiled and unsympathetic, with no in- 
clination to observe the life he has striven to forget, 
and spends his days repeating the mannerisms of 
Gallic painters and spreading the superstition that 
the French hold the great secret. Commercially it 
is an advantage, but intellectually it is ruin. America 
is matured; she can learn from France just as she 
can learn from Russia; but it must be in an adult 
fashion and not in the spirit of childish romance. 
Our younger men, instead of trying to fathom 
Cezanne's extraordinary mastery of form and his 
dynamic use of color, have mistaken his crudities 
for accomplishments, his most obvious faults for 
virtues, and are flooding the galleries with eccen- 
tricities which bear no relation to the structural 
unities aimed at, if not always realized, by their 
master. Picasso's pictures, which were born of a 
dissatisfaction with his limited achievements in ob- 
jective form, virtually exhausted the possibilities of 
Cubism. And yet our galleries continually exhibit 
imitations that are utterly without meaning, that 
are ignorantly conceived and often offensively ab- 
surd. American Cubism is the simple and super- 
ficial process of drawing planes at random. In much 
the same way Matisse's distorted nudes have been 
misapprehended; and Gauguin's decorations; and 
the work of many lesser figures who have derived 
from the Persians and primitives. On the other 
hand, Renoir, unquestionably a master, is not fre- 
quently plagiarized: he is not shocking; he is dif- 



1919

ficult to understand; and his technical methods are 
inimitable. 

In spite of the tendency to worship foreign idols, 
there is hope. America abounds in talent; and, in 
so far as technical skill enters into the problem, our 
artists need not defer to the French. It is, in a 
measure, not unreasonable for them to look to 
Europe for stimulation and appreciation : Americans 
cannot continue to put every obstacle in the way 
of their artists and then expect them to turn out 
masterpieces. The American painter is practically 
dissociated from his public, which is confined to a 
handful of tired critics, a few dealers, and oc- 
casional visitors to the galleries. As a result he lives 
a feckless and incomplete life ; he is too much alone ; 
he is generally unfamiliar with the world around 
him and boastful of his aloofness. His canvases are 
but confirmations of his dwarfed existence. The 
work of the most promising young men, the men 
in whom we must place our hopes for distinguished 
and enduring productions, is well painted, often 
surpassingly executed ; it is clever ; more likely than 
not it is richly colored ; but the most of it falls flat. 
It bears the stamp of the studio, and the French 
studio at that. The painter of still-life has become 
a nuisance, the abstractionist a bore. What the 
American artist needs above everything else is to 
get close to nature in the largest and profoundest 
sense; to relate himself to the plangent American 
life that envelops him; to study it, absorb it, and 
understand it. Only when he has done this will he 
begin to create. He cannot remain an eremite -re- 
lying upon a color theory, an adoration of Cezanne, 
and a penchant for second-hand metaphysics, and still 
do organic art. It is worth remembering that when 
Michael Angelo ceased to return to nature and be- 
gan to depend upon scientific formulae his work im- 
mediately lost much of its strength and structural 
power. 



AMERICAN PAINTERS OF THE " NEW MOVE- 
ment " seem to have come to a full stop. They are 
showing signs of vacillation and are beginning to 
drift into their appropriate pathways. In order to 
get their bearings, some have momentarily ceased 
to paint; some have fallen back on illustration, 
which once they deprecated so noisily; some guilty 
apostates are gradually creeping into the folds of 
the academically respectable; only a few are prose- 
cuting their talents without fear or compromise. 
Now, as Clive Bell has said, bad modern art is no 
worse than any other art that is bad ; but it affords 
the old-fashioned critics an opportunity to cackle 
over the failure they so strenuously predicted and so 
arrogantly tried to compass. Meanwhile, to the 
sympathizers with new and vitalizing forces, it is 
in no sense a failure but a temporary depression, a 
natural reaction. In the main the modern heretics 



were right it was courageous and commendable to 
fight against the inanities of the Academy and all 
other forms of stupid copying, whether of nature or 
of the old art. The present stoppage of significant 
productivity in America is due rather to a certain 
want of understanding. The first requisite to crea- 
tive work is a definite and precise knowledge of the 
desired end: unfortunately most of our younger 
painters, when asked about their intentions, are un- 
able to give adequate or even intelligible answers 
they shift the responsibility to Rousseauiwn, pro- 
claiming their right to " express themselves." But 
expression no more makes art than a child's howling 
makes music, and it is doubtful if their canvases are 
now even sincere expressions. It was easy to imitate 
the most startling idiosyncrasies of Cubism and 
Futurism; it was exhilarating to shock the public; 
but now that these schools have ceased to be shock- 
ing, our painters must use their own brains or 
perish they may profit by the aggregate good of 
the new movement but they cannot go on imitating 
its manifestations and expect an audience. 

JOHN G. NEIHARDT'S THE SONG OF THREE 
Friends (Macmillan) begins with an uncomprom- 
ising question : 

Who now reads clear the roster of that baud? 
Alas, Time scribbles with a careless hand 
And often pinchbeck doings from that pen 
Bite deep, where deeds and dooms of mighty mem 
Are blotted out beneath a sordid scrawl! 

And one would perhaps, read no further Jbr the 
poetry did one not recall the epic of Hugh Glass. 
In Hugh Glass the story held the attention and the 
poetry quickened the pulse. This Three Friends, 
which is designed to introduce Hugh Glass and form 
the first of a cycle of poems dealing with the fur 
trade period in the trans-Missouri region, neither 
interests as a narrative nor stimulates m Terse. 
There are indeed passages where spring tingles and 
a Southwest summer scarcely breathes; but there is 
no Jamie section and no Crawl section, and the 
primitive beauty that flourished in the earlier poems 
blooms here only in intermittent patches.

Communications 

THE RUSSIAN REACTION TO THE JAPANESE 

SIR: If what Mr. Joshua Rosett says in The 
Prussians of the Eastern World in THE DIAL of 
August 9, 1919 concerning the conduct of the 
Japanese Army in Siberia is true (and it must be 
true considering the fact that they shoot strikers of 
their own country now and helpless innocent peas- 
ants in Korea) then the Russians, especially the 
Siberians, are right and just in hating the Japanese, 
who have invaded Siberia against their wishes. 
Japan, in landing her troops in Vladivostok, 
declared that she would not interfere with the 
internal policy of the Siberians (so did other powers) 
but Japan has been interfering right along directly 
with the internal policies of the Siberians under the 
pretext first of helping the Czecho-Slovaks and then 
of keeping peace and order along the Siberian Rail- 
road, which is under the sole control of the U. S. A. 
I do not defend any act of the Japanese army 
in Siberia. I am against militarism, especially the 
Siberians' intervention, and condemn their brutal 
and inhuman conduct, but the acts of officers in the 
matter of the hospital, which Mr. Rossett has so 
graphically given in the said article, are the direct 
result of Japanese Militarism. 

I do not agree with Mr. Rosett in saying that 
Japan led the Allied Powers to the aid of a dis- 
tressed and helpless neighbor Russia when the 
tidal wave of Bolshevism swept from European 
Russia into Siberia; Japanese troops weeding out 
the Bolsheviki and the moral backing of* the Japan- 
ese had induced the Czecho-Slovaks to put the Bol- 
shevik Soviets out of business in Siberia, thus en- 
abling the regularly elected organs of democratic 
government to take their proper places. Mr. Rosett 
tried to find causes of Russian hatred against the 
Japanese; why the Russians hate the Japs in spite 
of this. Here Mr. Rosett made a grave mistake; 
the Russians hate the Japanese not in spite of these 
services of the Japanese army, but directly on 
account of these. I can say this from the result of 
the election at Vladivostok just after the Czecho- 
slovaks ousted the Soviets. 

The present hatred of the Russians is not the 
continuation of the hatred that started at Russia's 
defeat in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904 but the 
direct result of the unjust intervention of the 
Japanese army in Siberia. The majority of the 
Siberians are now the Bolsheviki and they became 
so on account of the Allied intervention. Mr. A. R. 
Williams said that the landing of the Japanese 
troops at Vladivostok made all Siberians Bolshevik. 
The present deadly hatred of the Japanese on the 
part of the Russians is not entirely racial, as Mr. 
Rosett thinks. No, their present hatred against the 
Japanese is on account of the armed intervention 
by the Japanese ; so it is almost entirely on account 
of fear of the Japanese Militarism. I know the 



noble characteristics of the Russian so eloquently 
does Mr. Rosett present them. " The whole world 
knows the Russians to be a patient and hospitable 
people, quick to appreciate an act of kindness and 
never slow to forgive an offense." It was shown 
also to the Japanese all over Russia, during and 
after the present war until the unjust interven- 
tion. This was one of the chief reasons why Uchida, 
former Ambassador to Petrograd and present for- 
eign minister, was strenuously opposed to the 
Siberian intervention. During the war, the Jap 
Red Cross workers who served among the Russian 
army never encountered any antipathetic feeling on 
the part of Russian soldiers, including the Siberians. 
We know that there are many Russians who do not 
consider the Jap subhuman, with a little tail. The 
Lenin and Trotsky government extended a cordial 
hand of international fellowship to the Japanese 
people and workers, as expressly enunciated in the 
Oriental policy of the said Government printed in 
the New York Volkszeitung, December 8, 1918. 
Mr. Rosett's statements are too sweeping and 
too prejudicial and amount to inciting a racial 
hatred between the Russians and Japanese. I can 
say with the support of the Russian comrades 
that the Japanese workers are not hated by the 
Russian Communists. They do hate, of course, 
as every socialist does, the militarism and im- 
perialism of Japan and of other countries, includ- 
ing the U. S. A., when these exist. The Japanese 
Socialists have the most cordial and really dynamic 
relations with Russian Socialists and Bolsheviki that 
were first established during the Russo-Japanese 
War of 1904. But if Mr. Rosett says that he is 
only speaking for the Russians who support the 
Kolchak Government and other reactionary powers 
in European Russia and Siberia, then he must say 
so and not speak in such general terms. 

Mr. Rosett is mistaken in saying that Japanese 
women are harnessed to wagons by ropes and 
dragging burdens. They must have appeared 
repulsively brutal, but such is not the case. The 
Japanese woman is an independent worker in this 
case, just as her husband; they work together and 
enjoy together the result of their own Labor. They 
can rest any time, any length of time, and anywhere 
they wish. They own the wagon they pull and in 
many cases they carry their own goods. My mother 
used to do the same kind of work, but she gave me 
a strong healthy body. She never complained of 
her work so many do not even today. They are 
working of their own volition. They must not be 
compared with the mules of the South that are 
driven by the whips of the colored people. The 
custom may appear cruel to a foreigner, but from 
the actual experience of life their lot is far better 
than those spinning girls who work in the cotton 
factory just as their sisters do in the American 
cotton factories! Mr. Rosett's judgment of the 
Japanese women workers is utterly superficial and 
wrong he did not take into consideration the eco- 



1919 



THE DIAL 



nomic structure of Japanese society. What is eat- 
ing up the very vitality of the Japanese workers 
is not what Mr. Rosett saw in the rice fields or on 
the wayside passing by, but in the very system of 
industry imported from his own country or the 
other Western countries. 

Mr. Rosett seems to put great faith in the old 
Czarist army officer who is the enemy of the Bol- 
sheviki of Russia. I wish to call Mr. Rosett's 
attention to the fact that the Bolsheviki of Russia 
today consist of the vast majority of Russian 
people, with a stable government at Moscow that 
has existed since November, 1917. That govern- 
ment and its people no doubt hate and fear the Jap 
militarists and the army under their command in 
Siberia, but they do not hate the Japanese people 
and especially the workers. On the contrary, they 
are inviting the Japanese workers to Russia. Under 
the Bolshevik rule no Russian hates or fears a for- 
eigner, for as long as they are workers, they are 

comrades.

BASEBALL AND RIVALRY 

SIR: One always hesitates to differ with one's 
teacher. Especially must one be careful in assum- 
ing to express a disagreement with a teacher who 
introduced one to philosophic thought. It is there- 
fore only with reserve that I offer a word in criti- 
cism of the article of Professor Cohen in the Dial 
for July 26 on Baseball. 

Professor Cohen quite correctly finds in Base- 
ball the expression of religious emotions. Although 
I am not myself a devotee of the game, I am yet 
convinced by my friends who are, that it is a truly 
religious enthusiasm which grips one in witnessing 
a game. There is a "mystic unity with a larger 
life of which we are a part." But the mystic being 
in Baseball is the city. We have then a deep enthu- 
siasm to see our city vindicated, its "honor" upheld. 
If it is true that the "truly religious devotee has 
his soul directed to the final outcome" it is because 
he feels that " his " city is to rise or fall according 
to whether or not her sons succeed in maintaining 
her prestige. I pass over the fundamental false- 
hood of the underlying premises, for in almost every 
case the city's team has nothing in common with 
the city, in no way represents it, save that it uses its 
name. There remains the basic question: Can a 
spirit that makes for contention be compatible with 
the establishment of a Church Universal " in which 
all men may find their brotherhood in the Infinite 
Game"? 

There is in every human breast an instinct of 
self-assertion. This usually takes the form of a 
desire to stand out, to be noticed. This instinct 
need not, however, necessarily make for rivalry. It 
is not essential that A be pushed into the back- 



ground in order that B may stand in the foreground, 
just as there is no need for the enslavement of A in 
order that B may be a lord. There is room enough 
for all in this world. It is only in its depraved 
stages that the instincts of self-assertion seek 
" honor " rather than responsibility, only in their 
abnormal functioning that they are not satisfied with 
the love of the near but demand the fear and the 
respect of the distant. It is then that they degenerate 
into ambition and become an overpowering passion. 

The spirit of rivalry between individuals is easily 
transferred to communities and to nations. From 
wishing myself to be the Mayor of my city, and the 
President of my land, I easily come to desire to see 
my city the foremost in the land and my people the 
most powerful on the globe. I want to have its in- 
fluence felt, and this desire is translated into a wish 
into having it feared abroad. For this purpose I 
vote it. heavy armaments. I rejoice in being told 
that mine is the richest country on the globe, not be- 
cause that makes me or anyone else any happier, but 
because my country stands out and is more powerful 
than the rest. I want New York to be the largest 
city, not for any benefit that will accrue to anyone 
from such a state of affairs, but because she happens 
to be my city. . . . 

Anything that makes for contention cannot be 
ennobling. It is a false doctrine that rivalries and 
aspirations of nations must find some outlet. It is 
as untrue as the belief that we can avert sex- 
depravity by introducing sensuous negroid dances or 
Arabic tales into our civilization. The truth is that 
these only help to deprave an instinct otherwise quite 
useful. And similarly, games that call for conten- 
tion help to arouse emotions that make for the de- 
generation of the self-assertive instincts. 

Professor Cohen seems impressed with the democ- 
ratizing influence of Baseball. He forgets, ap- 
parently, that this democracy is inherent in all move- 
ments which emphasize the emotional aspects of life. 
During a political campaign the most aristocratic 
will often forget his theories and take a smoke or a 
drink from one of the commonplace with whom he 
might ordinarily disdain to speak. . . . 

We cannot expect to rise by appealing to base- 
ness, we cannot develop social feeling by appealing 
to anti-social instincts. The war against war should 
have taught us the fallacy of such a contradiction in 
terms. Paradoxes may sometimes be true, but the 
criterion of truth cannot be the paradoxical formula- 
tion of a statement. 

The less of rivalry that we have, the less we in- 
sist on the self, whether it take the form of the ag- 
grandizement of one's individuality, one's nation or 
one's race, the nearer will we approach our ideal. 
Cooperation should be the goal rather than victory, 
cooperation in an attempt to gain the mastery of the 
universe. It is the infinite game between mind and 
matter. Louis FINKELSTEIN.

Notes on New Books 

SYLWIA AND MICHAEL. By Compton Mack- 
enzie. 323 pages. Harper. 

It is no narrow background that Compton Mack- 
enzie has chosen for his latest novel; he does not 
confine himself to the four walls of a house or to 
one city or country. With Sylvia and Michael the 
headlong action of the movies establishes itself 
among the consecrated ranks of the young English- 
men. The story opens in Paris, moves rapidly to 
Petrograd, where it halts for sixty-odd pages, and 
for the remainder of the volume flashes from Kiev 
to Odessa to Warsaw, from Bucharest and 
Avereshti to, Nish, and finally closes in a calm 
Samothracian pastoral with the promise of contin- 
ued action in a future novel. New characters are 
brought before us constantly, are painted vividly 
and unforgettably in a paragraph or a chapter, and 
disappear, probably forever. No book comes easily 
that has described so well the kaleidoscope of Rus- 
sia and the Balkans in 1915, although one is re- 
minded slightly of John Reed and The War in 
Eastern Europe. 

The virid characters, however, are restricted t& 
their various paragraphs, and the background re- 
mains background. The whole action is centered 
around the adventures of Sylvia Scarlett, the fascin- 
ating, brilliant, erratic, but always charming Sylvia. 
" To satisfy a whim," says the notice on the cover, 
" she throws away a big career. She makes her 
way alone through dangers that would terrify most 
men." All this she does, and more, but she remains 
little more than a wooden doll, the limbs of which 
Mr. Mackenzie has set into violent motion, and the 
mouth of which he has formed to repeat the speeches 
which he writes for her. The more rapid the ac- 
tion in which she is engaged, the more profound 
her musings, the more does she lose versimilitude. 
It is the misfortune of Compton Mackenzie that 
after half a dozen excellent novels, he has lost the 
power to visualize his heroes and heroines. When 
he derotes his hand to miniatures or landscapes, he 
is still the accomplished artist, but his portraits are 
failure*. He can no longer make them live. 

STORM IN A TEACUP. By Eden Phillpotts. 
303 pages. Macmillan. 

By the title, the English novelist defines the scope 
of his newest story, but leaves to the reader the dis- 
covery of the stinging strength of the brew. Phill- 
potts withholds the lump of sugar ; he is not so spar- 
ing of lemon. For a leisurely novel, which shuns 
briskness as a plague, it nevertheless imparts a pun- 
gent acid flavor as though, perhaps, a few drops of 
rum had been added at the last moment. Storm in 
a Teacup is another study in Phillpotts' established 
locale " with Dartmoor flung in a dim arc be- 
yond." The story centers about the workers in a 
paper mfll, and woven through the chapters is a con- 



secutive exposition of that tedious, fascinating 
process, deftly linked up with the major concerns of 
the three outstanding characters. There is, more- 
over, a colorful gallery of figures in the background, 
emerging and receding, each one weighing somehow 
in the scales which Phillpotts examines so de- 
liberately and with such insight. 

He starts with a rather highly strung woman, 
married to a light-hearted, unhorizonized mill- 
worker a man of sound sense but lacking the 
requisite aura of mystery. The wife, thinking she 
sees quite through him and finding his soul bare of 
disquieting symptoms, jumps to the conclusion that 
he is dull, and forthwith runs off with another. The 
successor, who had been a rival suitor before her 
marriage, is one of those beings with a mission to 
uplift their fellows, but with a woefully wooden 
interior in the face of romantic crises. He insists- 
upon an unconsummated elopement, pending the di- 
vorce. The husband finally punctures the bubble 
simply by refraining from the necessary legal steps, 
and in the end, a chastened wife is restored to him. 

This skeleton is inadequate to suggest the delicacy, 
the humor, and the incisive bits of character draw- 
ing which Phillpotts has put into the framework. 
The woman's discovery that a husband who is trans- 
parent may not be nearly so dull as a man with only 
one idea even an altogether admirable moral one 
is very subtly threaded into the texture of the story, 
and the philosophic warp is felt, but never insisted 
upon. Phillpotts chooses to interpret life with the 
labels removed. 



THE OXFORD HISTORY OF INDIA. By Vincent 
A. Smith. 816 pages. Oxford University 
Press. 

At the conclusion of a long and distinguished 
career in the Indian Civil Service as an adminis- 
trator, as well as in the capacity of a careful and 
enthusiastic student of India's past, Mr. Vincent A. 
Smith has now given us his definitive history of In- 
dia. His previous works on the Fine Arts of In- 
dia and Ceylon, on the early relations between East 
and West down to the time of Alexander the 
Great's invasion, to say nothing of his studies of 
the lives of the " Great Mogul " Akbar, and of the 
Constantine of Buddhism, the emperor Asoka, were 
valuable preparation for this succinct and compre- 
hensive survey. Well might the author have chosen 
as motto for this last work, completed in his retire- 
ment: Finis coronat opus. 

When Master Ralph Fitch, one of the earliest 
travelers in India, closed his entertaining pages with 
the satisfaction that he had had " to declare some 
things which India do bring forth " he little realized 
the demand that would some day arise for such 
knowledge, both in the Bureau of Commerce at 
Washington and in the American public libraries. 
Yet in the early nineteenth century how intimate was 
our contact with India ! Those were the days when 



1919 



THE DIAL 



our fast clipper ships from Salem and other New 
England ports were outsailing the heavy, teak- 
built East Indiamen that plied between Gravesend 
and Surat, fighting the Portuguese, Dutch, and 
French, and arriving in the Thames when hope had 
vanished, to have their rich cargoes sold by the light 
of a candle. According to custom all bids for these 
rich cargoes were accepted while a candle of of- 
ficial length burned. All this trade the swifter 
Yankee craft fell heir to because of finer shipwrights 
and speed. Even within the memory of the re- 
viewer there stood at Bombay the old American 
Ice House, where New England apples, and ice 
from little Wenham Pond near Boston, once were 
sold to the homesick Europeans, this being the bal- 
last that the wily Yankee brought so as to return 
laden with silk, calicoes, and tea. We do not doubt 
that an older generation of Anglo-Indian punch 
drinkers had their experience with the wooden-nut- 
meg from Connecticut. 

From the rich material of Mr. Smith's work it 
now remains for some embryo Doctor of Philosophy 
to write an American history of India. As Mr. 
Smith reminds us in these pages, the critical period 
of British supremacy in India coincided with the 
revolutionary wars in America. British cabinets 
and parliaments came to power or fell solely upon 
their Indian and American policies. Today East 
and West are one. This story of India's glorious 
past is essential if we are to understand the political 
future promised India by the recent Montagu Bill, 
coming so close upon our own Jones Bill in the 
Philippines. Whether or not we assume any man- 
dates for folks dubbed in Kipling's silly rhetoric 
" half-devil and half-child," America's provincial 
detachment is gone. There is enough food for re- 
flection if we recall that American statesmen formu- 
lated those two epoch-making policies, The Open 
Door and Self-Determination. 



INDIA IN TRANSITION. By the Aga Khan. 310 
pages. Putnam. 

His Highness, the Aga Khan, once the symbol in 
India of reactionary associations, stands before the 
public today as a reformer. He is a man of wide 
culture and far travels. He is the religious head of 
the Ismaili Mahomedans scattered over India, Cen- 
tral Asia, and East Africa. He has been created a 
first class Prince by the British Raj, and is entitled 
to eleven guns. He is immensely wealthy, and has 
rendered a great service to India by trying to estab- 
lish a Mahomedan University at Aligarh. Per- 
haps the government opposition to his noble scheme 
has partially opened his eyes to the real motives of 
British rule in India. The author wholeheartedly 
repudiates the British educational policy in India, 
and he even makes bold to say: "There is no 
running away from this need for education diffusion 
since it is a question of life arid death for India. 
No compromise as to providing this essential ground- 
work of national development can be tolerated." It 



is however exceedingly amusing to see the author 
straddle. It is almost tragic. All through the book 
there is a feeling of suppressed resentment. Thus 
he speaks of Great Britain's educational and econ- 
omic achievements in India: " Britain has been 
criticized and rightly criticized for having allowed 
the twentieth century to dawn and grow without 
having grappled fully and successfully with the 
illiteracy general in India, and with the unsanitary 
environment of the masses, so bad that avoidable 
deaths are counted by the million every year." But 
like'his fellow home-rulers, the Redmonds and T. P. 
O'Connor's of India, he stands for the perpetuation 
of the system he condemns, and renounces the 
claim to complete autonomy in the admission that 
" Englishmen are in official position in India be- 
cause, after her chequered and tragic history, she is 
not able to satisfactorily settle her own affiairs 
without the cooperation of people from happier 
lands." 



LETTERS TO THE PEOPLE OF INDIA ON RE- 
SPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. By Lionel Curtis. 
211 pages. Macmillan. 

The author of the book under review, Mr. Lionel 
Curtis, is a Knight of the new British Round Table 
of imperialism, and his policy of liberalism aims to 
counteract the growing movement for India's com- 
plete independence. Nevertheless this book frankly 
exposes some of the present awkward anomalies of 
the British administration in India. Writes the 
author: 

So far as the Indian and Provincial governments are 
concerned, responsible government has no place in the ex- 
isting constitution. . . . The legislatures consist part- 
ly of officials, who in the Governor-General's Council only 
are in the majority, partly of non-officials, mostly Indians, 
appointed by the Government, and partly by members, 
almost entirely Indian, who do not hold their seats by 
Government appointment. From the latest returns it ap- 
pears that the Imperial Council consists of 68 members, 27 
of whom are elected. Of these 18 are elected to speak 
for sectional interests, either landholders, Mahomedans, 
merchants, or manufacturers. The remaining, indirectly 
elected by non-official members of the nine Provincial 
Councils, are presumably intended to voice the views of 
the people at large. . . . Educated Indians are ac- 
cused of seeking an oligarchy under the guise of self- 
government Here, in a law made by ourselves, the image 
of oligarchy is stamped on the system. 

We are now in a position to trace the electoral chain 
by which a member of the Imperial Council is supposed 
to represent a voter in one of these divisions. 

1. The primary voter returns a member to the Dis- 
trict or Municipal Board. 

2. The Board returns members to an Electoral College. 

3. The College returns a member to the Provincial 
Council. 

4. The non-official members, including sectional mem- 
bers are those appointed by Government, return a member 
to the Imperial Legislative Council. 

The system is one which destroys any real connection 
between the primary voter and the member who sits on 
the Legislative Councils. 

Whenever there is a talk of political reform in 
India, the enemies of progress in that country in-

variably talk of India's social evils like the caste 
and other kindred topics, as though India were the 
only country where social evils are prevalent. Even 
the minds of intelligent Americans have been 
affected by propaganda of calumny and misrepre- 
sentation of conditions in India. But here is a 
Briton who seems to understand the problem. He 
says: 

I have often heard it said that, before Indians ask for 
political powers, they ought to devote themselves to the 
task of social reform. If Englishmen will think of the 
social reforms effected in their own country, they will 
realize how unfair and impossible a condition this is. 
What great social reform has ever been effected in Eng- 
land without legislative action? How could the employ- 
ment of women and children in industries and mines, 
the status of married women, or the sale of liquor, have 
been reformed without the enactment of a new law? ID 
India the need for social reform largely arises from cus- 
toms which have been crystallized by decisions in the 
courts, under the rigid legal system which we ourselves 
introduced from the West. 

Then the author points out how Mr. Bhupend- 
ranath Basu's Marriage Reform Bill was killed by 
the British government, though the Bill was sup- 
ported by men like Gokhale, Raja of Dighapatia, 
Jinnah, Madholkar, Dadabhoy, and others. " The 
whole corps of British officials were ordered by the 
Governor-General and his council to march into 
the lobby and vote the measure down." 'And it 
was done. Similarly Mr. Gokhale's Primary Edu- 
cation Bill, introducing free and compulsory primary 
education in India, was voted down by the Gover- 
nor-General and his council and this in the en- 
Hghtened twentieth century. 

THE NEW ELIZABETHANS. By E. B. Osborn. 
311 pages. Lane. 

SET DOWN IN MALICE. By Gerald Cumberland. 
286 pages. Brentano. 

UNCENSORED CELEBRITIES. By E. T. Raymond. 
244 pages. Holt. 

The intent to discover a single lofty chord, re- 
curring in the lives of more than a score of young 
men who met death in the war, and to set it vibrat- 
ing as a sort of overtone to the spirit in which they 
lived and died, has guided Mr. Osborn in preparing 
his brief memoirs. Despite an occasional over- 
emphasis and a somewhat too-frequent recourse to 
superlatives, the collection is of considerable value. 
The list is predominantly insular, but includes the 
Americans Alan Seeger and Harold Chapin. There 
is a brief outline of the life of each fighter, followed 
by a survey of his work. In the task of appraisal, 
the tendency is toward over-statement, but it is pos- 
sible for the reader to make the necessary reserva- 
tions. The style becomes a bit feverish at times, as 
in this reference to the boyhood of Seeger in New 
York: " The clangorous life of the pent city's life, 
which ever grows skyward, entered into his soul; 
his greatest joy was to follow the rushing fire-en- 



gines which are seen every day in her street-canons." 
Set Down in Malice and Uncensored Celebrities 
present sprightly pictures of individuals about whom 
the dust of controversy still flies. Both volumes 
conceal their authorship under pseudonyms. The 
former book is so vigorous in its opinions, so merci- 
less in its thrusts, and so altogether charming in its 
arrant pin-pricking that one lays it down with the 
utmost difficulty. Its author is an undisguised 
poseur, but he has acquitted himself so well in his 
self-imposed effrontery, that he deserves forgiveness 
and a wink. Mr. Raymond's racy volume, facile 
in skill and engaging in wit, contains sketches of 
thirty-two leading figures in English politics, with 
the English-born Gompers appended. Its rank is 
that of high-grade journalism. 

SCENES FROM ITALY'S WAR. By G. M. Trev- 
elyan. 240 pages. Houghton Mifflin. 

This volume supplies a sample of the kind of 
writing that may well reduce American literary men 
to despair. The sureness and dignity that charac- 
terizes the best English quarterlies is present here 
in large measure; considered language gives to the 
narrative something of the processional unity that 
the events themselves possessed. 

Historical judgment is another matter. Al- 
though in the introduction the author assumes no 
other obligations than those that belong to a nar- 
rator of individual experiences, a reading of the 
book reveals the fact that personal reminiscences 
are used only as they become serviceable to a tol- 
erably well organized history of Italy's part in the 
war. Even so, it is perhaps too much to expect 
that an Englishman, writing in the closing days of 
the conflict, would be bold enough to see the sim- 
ilarity between the bargain by means of which 
Buelow and Erzberger attempted to buy Italy's neu- 
trality, and the Treaty of London, which- named 
the Allied price of her participation in the war. The 
author's defense of Italian sincerity has lost some- 
thing of its force through the publication of the in- 
formation that the Triple Alliance was vitiated 
seventeen years ago by a secret convention between 
France and Italy. On the occasion of King Em- 
manuel's visit to Paris last winter, the Temps 
made it known that in 1902 an agreement was 
reached which provided that neither of the two 
countries should take part in any aggression against 
the other, and that neither should participate in any 
war against the other, even though self-declared, if 
this war was imposed by the will of the enemy (Le 
Temps, Paris, 22 December 1918). Villainies of 
one sort and another, from the secret diplomacy of 
Delcasse to the latest grand opera gesture of d'An- 
nunzio, have so blurred the political aspects of the 
situation that one turns with something like relief 
from this phase of the war to the author's more 
than readable account of straightforward pre- 
armistice fighting.

This timely volume is at once a contribution to the history of education in America, a memorial for all those who love 
Vassar, and the personal portrait of a great man. 

Professor Haight, Professor of Latin on the Vassar faculty and collaborator with President Taylor in his history of Vassar, 
has here added that chapter of personal history, of the influence and inspiration of a great educator and leader, which 
was necessarily omitted from the formal history of the college at that time. She has brought together his letter s 
sermons and speeches, including correspondence with such educators as Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Lyman P. Powell 
Edmund Gosse, President Fliot, and many others. But for those who knew him, the value of the letters which revea

THE TAKER. By Daniel Carson Goodman. 
346 pages. Boni & Liveright. 

As a rule, a novel in which the basic theme is 
egoism and particularly egoism of which the im- 
pelling force is sex may lay claim to the initial 
assumption that it aspires to serious consideration. 
In fact there are but two reasonable approaches to 
such a theme either in the mood of the toler- 
ant, satirical shrug of Schnitzler, or of downright 
earnestness, as in Dreiser. The book that does not 
cleave to one or the other of these fashions becomes 
ludicrous or stupid. The Taker becomes the 
latter. This is not to question the author's serious 
intent, however. There can be no doubt of Mr. 
Goodman's wish to be serious, but he has merely 
succeeded in piling one morbid incident upon another 
with no discernible sense of form, of style, or of 
character analysis. When he is most in earnest, he 
makes his hero merely foolish. It would be dif- 
ficult to match some of the supposedly illuminating 
speeches of the central character. They are witless, 
hollow : 

" I thought when I married you, that the mental and 
physical beings were entirely separate and independent 
of each other. That was the real reason for my marry- 
ing you. But I've learned, regardless of my fight against 
it, that one only reveals and completes the other. 

" One is the breath of life to the other. It's just like 
the new-born babe. It has a body and all that, but 
breath must be put into it before there is life. 

"Maybe life is just like a cigar, Mabel it takes a 
mighty good cigar to make us enjoy a smoke, yet the 
better the cigar the worse the after taste. So if we 
have just a little happiness then we have only a little 
suffering." 

Mr. Goodman has attempted the impossible. He 
has drawn a character with no other aim in life 
than the successive physical conquest of many wo- 
men, and then tried to throw a philosophic halo into 
the picture. On top of all that, he has attempted 
to make his pursuer aware of a cosmic urge,' as 
x though that explained everything. Altogether, a 
shoddy novel with nothing artistic to redeem it. 



ARCHITECTURE AND DEMOCRACY. By Claude 
B^agdon. 213 pages. Knopf. 

The author of Architecture and Democracy is a 
many-sided man, and there are many ways of ap- 
proaching his work. The architect and the mathe- 
matician, the layman and the mystic, will each find 
a portion of Mr. Bragdoh's book to which he may 
respond with complete sympathy. The criticism of 
pre-war architecture, with its pretentious " period " 
facades and its imbecility in design, the contrast be- 
tween arranged architecture and organic, should 
doubtless be familiar to members of the profession 
who are acquainted with the literature of non- 
academic criticism from Ruskin to Mr. L. March 
Phillips. But the call to forget the solutions of 



other ages and to confront the problems of one's 
own has not been adequately heeded, and it is well 
that architects should hear this exhortation from 
such eminent work-fellows as Mr. Bragdon, and his 
master, Louis Sullivan. And the task of the inno- 
vators will be lightened if a sense of past deficiencies 
and future possibilities is implanted in the public 
whom the architect incidentally serves. Those who 
felt strangely moved by the restrained novelty of the 
decorations for the Song and Light Festival held in 
Manhattan in the autumn of 1917 will be interested 
to note that the designs were derived from the pro- 
jection of the fourth dimension on a plane. Thus 
Mr. Bragdon exhibits his ability to put his text into 
action, for instead of leaning upon ancient forms he 
derives his decorative motifs from those mathe- 
matical discoveries which have had so large a part 
to play in the development of the art of engineering, 
the copartner of all that is new and virile in modern 
architecture. By wrestling with the lessons of 
science Mr. Bragdon has shown how esthetics may 
gain strength in its endeavor to refine and spiritual- 
ize the activities of democracy. 



THE .TRAGEDY OF LABOR: A Monograph in 
Folk Philosophy. By William Riley Halstead. 
107 pages. Abingdon Press. 

With the world in industrial ferment, and the at- 
tention of statesman and layman alike focused upon 
epoch-making social experiments; with governments 
eagerly seeking for something that will offer the 
hope of avoiding the seemingly inevitable death 
struggle between capital and labor over the wage 
system, it is a rash impertinence for any man to offer 
his personal preachments in lieu .of some method 
whereby a peaceful reconstruction of society may be 
accomplished. The author of The Tragedy of La- 
bor drops every discussion just where the curtain 
of revelation should rise. That the reconstruction 
of the world in more than a physical sense has al- 
ready begun, Mr. Halstead is blithely unaware. 
And where an earnest exposition of "folk-philos- 
ophy" is eagerly looked for, he gives us a jumble of 
impressions that is neither philosophy nor economics. 
In discussing the wage system, we learn that 

man has not learned a better economic way. The plan 
of it has become an industrial axiom, ft is only questioned 
by those who put themselves under a strain to find out 
some new thing, 

Of course, the man who would write that has 
the sweetest sympathy for the poor Poor. He is so 
sure that the world is just as lovely as it can possi-

October 4 



There is really no hope of improving the breed of 
man, apparently, for the dolt never will "get on," as 
the author informs us. And in a series of questions 
ending with "Is not the perpetual challenge of the 
breadline good for a man? " we learn that " To find 
a social response to that situation is simply a question 
<\f adroitness." For all issues the author claims that 
the solution lies in the realm of morals. But the 
relationship of changing moral standards to modern 
living conditions is nowhere touched upon. To him. 
morals are fixed and standardized virtues, not the 
mores of developing peoples. The last two chapters 
of the book do not offend; they are trite and harm- 
less. Nevertheless, if a high-school boy, seeking in- 
formation on current world topics, were to stumble 
upon The Tragedy of Labor, one more child 
would be thrown prematurely into the industrial 
cauldron. None but a sinner, hardened by the crime 
of reading, could finish the tragedy and care to read 
again. 

RELIGION AND CULTURE. A Critical Survey of 
Methods of Approach to Religious Phenomena, 
By Frederick Schleiter. 206 pages. Columbia 
University Press. 

This book is hopelessly mistitled. To be sure it 
touches the outskirts of its announced subject, but 
only the outskirts. Actually it is an examination of 
the concepts and modes of thought which have 
achieved vogue in the study of the ceremonies and 
beliefs of primitive peoples fetishism, animism, 
totemism, taboo, and so forth which for some non- 
consequential reason have been bundled together 
under the caption Religion, Primitive in the 
anthropological mind. Within this limited field 
Dr. Schleiter performs a service, calling attention 
to the need for critical restatement and indicating 
what are certainly more cautious, and hence sounder, 
modes of generalization than are most of those which 
have the vogue. The book ought to be read by all 
interested in the study of the paganism of savage- 
dom, that is, by professed anthropologists and com- 
parative religionists. It must be added that it ought 
not to be read fastidiously, for it is styleless or 
rather, it carries to absurdity the styleless style of 
the Spencerians (lacking, of course, Spencer's mag- 
niloquent boom) and it is grotesquely ornamented 
with terms drawn from a certain barbarous modern 
tongue. For example, the author wishes to say that 
many drugs still in use were known simply as 
medicines to primitive men; he says: 

A considerable part of our pharmacopoeia has developed 
from administrations utilized by primitive man, without 
antecedent adventitious genuflections or ideas regarding 
spiritual beings. 

Tylor and Frazer and Lang at least know the 
use of the English language, and until their critics 
attain their facility the older school will continue 
to dominate the field. 



SELF-GOVERNMENT IN THE PHILIPPINES. By 

Maxime M. Kalaw. 210 pages. Century. 

Under the Jones Law, which was passed by Con- 
gress in 1916, the United States is pledged to grant 
independence to the Filipinos as soon as they have 
proved their capacity to maintain a " stable " govern- 
ment. Professor Kalaw presents abundant evidence 
to show that the Filipinos have fulfilled their part 
of the bargain; and gently but firmly urges the 
United States to redeem its pledge. Under the 
administration of Governor-General Francis Burton 
Harrison, the Philippines have enjoyed practical 
autonomy; and Professor Kalaw shows how the 
economic prosperity of the islands has increased with 
the development of popular government. He des- 
cribes the successful administrative work of the 
Filipino officials, the rapid decrease in the public 
debt since the inauguration of responsible govern- 
ment and a budget system, the large appropriations 
for education, the amelioration of conditions among 
the Moros and other uncivilized tribes. He scouts 
the bogey of possible Japanese aggression which is 
so often raised by the American imperialist. He 
points out that Korea and Manchuria (he might 
have added Shantung) are natural fields for the 
expansion of Japan's surplus population and that 
the Japanese effort to colonize Formosa, which is 
located in a colder belt than the Philippines, has 
ended in a dismal fiasco. Professor Kalaw further 
reinforces his arguments with some unconsciously 
ironical references to the high democratic ideals of 
the late war and with an almost pathetically naive 
appeal to President Wilson's repeated expressions of 
sympathy with the aspirations of the Filipinos for 
independence. 



MUSINGS AND MEMORIES OF A MUSICIAN. 
By Sir George Henschel. 398 pages. Mac- 
millan. ^ 

Perhaps the preservation of the world's opinion 
of Sir George Henschel, first conductor of the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra and a European com- 
poser and singer of real merit, has value; but one 
would hardly have expected the record to have been 
compiled by Henschel himself. Such an autobiog- 
raphy the present volume primarily is, and it is 
difficult indeed for the reader to be generous-minded 
toward a writer when once the latter stands revealed 
as one who thrives on adulation and who has care- 
fully preserved in his mind or on paper a vast 
amount of material in praise of himself. Many 
important personages pass across these pages. The 
pride Sir George felt in being acquainted with them 
is omnipresent. But one searches in vain for evi- 
dences of that pleasing personality which must have 
been his in order to have retained such friends.

stein, Tausig, Von Bulow, Liszt, Leschetitsky, Clara 
Schumann, Tschaikovsky, Cui, Verdi, Paderewsky,

Foote, Elgar, Patti not to mention those 
noted friends of his who were important in 
fields other than music would have been a 
significant contribution. Pleasing anecdotes 
in regard to these persons are, of course, sup- 
plied; but little is added to our conception of 
their personalities. Brahms, by exception, is 
treated with sympathetic appreciation; but Sir 
George had already given his vivid impres- 
sions of this artist to the world in the Personal 
Recollections of Johannes Brahms (Badger; 
Boston, 1907). A life passed with such friends 
must have left recollections of great value con- 
cerning questions of musical principles and 
esthetics and tendencies ; but one finds little 
in this volume which will reward penetrative 
study. 

There are interesting pages concerning the 
beginnings of the Boston Orchestra and in ap- 
preciation of Mr. Higginson. An informative 
picture of the life of an eminently successful 
musician in the late Nineteenth Century in 
Germany and England is given. Sir George 
was born a Prussian. This should occasion 
no alarm, however, as the book, written previ- 
ous to the? war, has since been made entirely 
unobnoxious by changing the word St. 
Petersburg" to "Petrograd" ! The volume is 
written with careful lucidity and with an ab- 
sence of technical terms. It makes pleasant, 
light reading for all, and fascinating reading 
for some. The disappointment lies in what it 
might have been. 

FRENCH WAYS AND THEIR MEANING. By 
Edith Wharton. 149 pages. Appleton. 

Not alone the welcomed-home doughboy 
and the repatriated Tommy, but nearly every- 
body ^Ise in the Anglo-Saxon world fails today 
as ahvays to understand France. If curiosity 
were only as general as bafflement, Mrs. 
Whsrton's new volume would perhaps be as- 
sured of the wide reading it deserves. Not 
that all the questions that puzzle Anglo-Sax- 
ondom find here a definitive answer; even if 
other conditions were altogether favorable, the 
pressure of war emotions would preclude final- 
ity. But the volume does transcend its self- 
confessed limitations ; it offers more than one 
expects from "a desultory book, the result of 
intermittent observation, and often, no doubt, 
of rash assumption" ; it does in fact discover 
the direction which any study of France 
should take, and goes some little distance 
along the road to understanding. 

First and fundamentally, the society of 
France is "grown-up" of all societies "the 
most completely detached from the lingering 
spell of the ancient shadowy world in which 
trees and animals talked to each other, and 
began the education of the fumbling beast 
that was to deviate into man." The outstand- 
ing qualities of this adult and worldly-wise 
society are taste, reverence, continuity, and in- 
tellectual honesty. Taste the expression of 

"thp rnvstprimis rlptnanH rcf PVP anrl rninrl -fnr 



symmetry, harmony, and order" is the na- 
tural inheritance of the heirs of a classical tra- 
dition refined again by centuries of living 
under conditions that made order and accom- 
modation the prerequisites of existence. With 
the word "reverence" one is inclined to find 
fault mainly because this word has an emo- 
tional quality, that is foreign to the French 
mind, and would necessarily set limits to in- 
tellectual honesty. "Historical prudence" is 
perhaps a more accurate denominator for the 
quality the author has in mind ; certainly it is 
more exactly descriptive of the type of intel- 
lect that raises no obstacles to investigation, 
but at the same time refuses to break the 
household gods until reason proves them false. 

It is these adult qualities of proportion, 
poise, and intellectual fearlessness, rather than 
any over-emotionality, that make the French 
doubtful of excesses in vice and virtue, but 
nevertheless permit them to sample all that is 
new before they abandon anything time-tested 
of their fathers. 

THE DICKENS CIRCLE. By J. W. T. Ley. 

352 pages. Dutton. 

We are so much accustomed to a manner of 
delicious mockery directed towards any scene 
plucked from mid- Victoria that J. W. T. Ley's 
The Dickens Circle appears with all the shock 
of a novelty. For the author, disclaiming at 
once the role of a critic, assumes an attitude 
of gracious cordiality, and in the manner of a 
quiet host, with the least possible intrusion 
of his own personality, introduces us to all of 
those figures, little and big, unassuming and 
pretentious, who went to make up the wide 
circle of the Dickens acquaintanceship. And 
there emerges from a mass of detail a nine- 
teenth century that we were wont to believe 
in before the days of Mr. Strachey and other 
trumpeters who shattered so effectually the 
walls of Victorian respectability. The great 
Charles appears, graphically if not delicately 
sketched, as essentially democratic, sociable, 
unintrospective embodying qualities that en- 
deared him to all manner's and conditions of 
men. His contemporaries are the agreeable 
geniuses of men of talent that we have met 
before through the pages of kindly histories 
of literature. In short, here is the warm and 
tender, the sentimental and self-sufficient Eng- 
land of the last century. Mr. Ley should not 
be criticized for failure to have penetrated 
deeper beneath the surface. Dickens lover 
that he is, he has seen through rosy glasses 
all of those who came to join a varied and ever 
widening circle. To have presupposed a 
murky situation in a setting of tinsel and then 
cast upon it the clear white light of truth 
would have been beyond his role as the cheer- 
ful host and modest interpreter. The material 
for this work, we are told in the preface, was 
overwhelming and the difficulty lay in .decid- 
ing what to omit. The difficulty was not en- 
tirely overcome and exists as a blemish in the

The Emancipation of Massachusetts: The Dream 
and the Reality, by Brooks Adams (534 pages; 
Houghton Mifflin), first appeared more than 
thirty years ago. A new edition gives the au- 
thor the opportunity to embody in a preface of 
168 pages his conspectus of universal history 
a trenchant criticism in the same vein as Mr. 
Adams' later Theory of Social Revolutions. 

A Brief History of Europe: From 1789 to 1815, by 
Lucius Hudson Holt and Alexander Wheeler 
Chilton (358 pages; Macmillan), limits itself to 
the purely political and military aspects of the 
period. Review later. 

The Spirit of Russia, by Thomas Garrigue Masaryk 
(2 vols., 1065 pages; Macmillan), marshals an 
imposing collection of studies in history, litera- 
ture, and philosophy. This book promises to 
take an important place in the literature on 
Russia. Review later. 

The Russian Diary of Englishman, (228 pages; 
McBride), contain? some tolerably interesting 
passages dealing with the overthrow of the Czar 
and the Kerensky revolution. Its historical 
value is vitiated by the fact that the identity of 
the author is not revealed. 

England and Ireland, In the Past and at Present, 
by Edward Raymond Turner (504 pages; Cen- 
tury), ineffectually endeavors to throw the neu- 
tral light of scholarly investigation upon a 
darkly controversial subject. Review later. 

The Holocaust, by A. A. Pons, translated by P. R. 
Lloyd (329 pages; McBride), is a description of 
the Risorgimento movement in Italy, the move- 
ment that created a national state out of a 
"geographic expression." Lord Bryce's introduc- 
tion reminds us that the leaders of the Risorgi- 
mento were "thinking not of territorial exten- 
sions . . . but of the rule of justice in a 
world set free for peace in which nationalism 
was to be subordinated to the common welfare 
of humanity." 

Bulgaria: Problems and Politics, by George Clen- 
ton Logic (285 pages; Doran), has the merit of 
discussing a propagandist subject in a not too 
obviously propagandist way. The author is a 
lecturer in Bulgarian at the University of Lon- 
dpn, and by nationality a Greek. 

Fields of Victory, by Mrs. Humphry Ward (274 
pages; Scribner), is a concise resume of the last 



year of the Great War, completing the record 
begun in England's Effort and in Towards the 
Goal. It has perspective and clear vision. Re- 
view later. 

Documents and Statements Relating to Peace Pro- 
posals and War Aims: December 1916 No- 
vember 1918 (259 pages; Macmillan), is a valu- 
able sourcebook to which Lowes Dickinson's 
introduction, written in April 1919, when the 
hope for applying impartially the Wilsonian 
formulae still nickered feebly, is an invaluable 
contribution. 

The Soul of the "C. R. B.," by Madame Sainte-Rene 
Taillandier (233 pages; Scribner), deals with 
food relief in the days when its object was the 
preservation of human life in Belgium and 
northern France not the restoration of reac- 
tionary government in Hungary and Russia. 

My "Little Bit," by Marie Corelli (218 pages; Dor- 
an), must be a reprint of almost everything the 
novelist thought and said about the war, and of 
some things which she merely said. Review later. 

The Command Is Forward, by Sergeant Alexander 
Woollcott (304 pages; Century), collects a series 
of dispatches and drawings which appeared 
originally in The Stars and Stripes, the official 
newspaper of the A. E. F. The chattiness of 
the news stories and the cheerfulness of most of 
the drawings illustrate the commonplace that 
armies smile at death. 

The Mud Larks, by Crosbie Garstin (213 pages; 
Doran). One reads on the ^over that these 
British battling sketches or some of them 
have appeared in Punch. One samples the 
sketches, and wonders why. 

Peace and Business, by Isaac F. Marcosson (292 
pages; Lane), is the report of the war-time in- 
vestigations of a man whose mind is entirely at 
peace with business. Bankers return from 
Europe with a new vision of society but their 
acolytes bring back only the promise of busi- 
ness as usual. 

The Story of Our Merchant Marine, by Willis J. 
Abbot (373 pages; Dodd, Mead), is a historical 
account of the development of American ship- 
ping, popular in its diction and near-juvenile in 
its illustrations. 

J. William White, M.D., by Agnes Repplier (283 
pages; Houghton Mifflin), is the biography of a 
distinguished Philadelphia surgeon who is 
known to the younger generation as one of the 
more expressive exponents of the Anglo-French 
cause prior to our entering the war, as well as 
a humane organizer of neutral hospital services 
in France. Enough to say of Dr. White's per- 
sonality that his portrait has been drawn for us 
by Thomas Eakins, John Sargent, and Agnes 
Repplier. 

Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children, edited 
by Joseph Bucklin Bishop (240 pages; Scribner), 
is worth a dozen adulatory biographies in its 
revelation of the author's character. The father, 
the human being, throws an interesting sidelight 
upon the public man, the effigy, because in a 
sense Father continued to remain an effigy even 
in the midst of parental diversions. Review later. 

A Childhood in Brittany Eighty Years Ago, by 
Anne Douglas Sedgwick (illustrated, 224 pages; 
Century), is a charming mosaic of childhood 
recollections of life in an out-of-the-way corner 
of old France, rich in legends and tenacious of 
its inherited customs and loyalties. Review later.

October 4 



The Amazing City, by John F. Macdonald (304 
pages; Lippincott), has for author the one time 
Paris dramatic critic for the Fortnightly Re- 
view. He was, too, "a student of human life" 
so the preface says. It is evident that he found 
life in Paris most amiable, and that in ante- 
diluvian days he discovered much that the war 
itself has not revealed to the generality beyond 
the Channel and the Sea. Review later. 

California Desert Trails, by J. Smeaton Chase (il- 
lustrated, 387 pages; Houghton Mifflin), has not 
the full tone-range of its subject, but is never- 
theless so well and unpretentiously done that 
the reading of a chapter or two stirs a longing 
for wide spaces. 

Field, Forest and Farm, by Jean-Henri Fabre, (253 
pages; Scribner), translated by Florence Con- 
stable Bicknell, gives young American readers 
the opportunity to follow the author of Our 
Humble Helpers into haunts frequented by na- 
ture-lovers, gardeners, and fruit-growers. A 
familiarity with these rural fields will breed not 
contempt but appreciation of Fabre's scientific 
illuminations. 

Fishing Tackle and Kits, by Dixie Carroll (334 
pages; Stewart and Kidd, Cincinnati), has a 
salutation, a dedication, a foreword, a preface, 
an introduction, and some 130 topics all relat- 
ing to angling. Much of it is reprinted from 
magazine and newspaper sources, with the chaff 
remaining in it; but the book is comprehensive, 
chatty, and convivial. Angling for readers, Mr. 
Carroll baits his hook with slang. 

The Justification of the Good: An Essay on Moral 
Philosophy, by Vladimir Solovyof, translated by 
Nathalie A. Duddington (475 pages; Macmillan), 
is less a contribution to ethical knowledge than 
to national understanding. The author goes 
back to Vico in founding his moral-religious 
system upon shame and fear, to Comte in his 
consecration of the Eternal Feminine; and to 
Augustine in his attempt to establish spiritually 
the Universal Church. 

Philosophic Thought and Religion, by D. Ambrose 
Jones (60 pages; Macmillan), surveys important 
philosophic systems from Aristotle to Eucken 
for the sake of proving that Christianity fills the 
gap which they leave vacant. It is an effort to 
make a guidebook take the place of an encyclo- 
pedia. 

Heartbreak House, Great Catherine, and Playlets 
of the War, by Bernard Shaw (295 pages; Bren- 
tano), consists of half a dozen one-acters and 
prefaces. "Heartbreak House is not merely the 
name of the play which follows" the first pre- 
face. "It is cultured, leisured Europe before 
the war." Shaw's criticism of Heartbreak 
House follows the lines of Misalliance and Get- 
ting Married; the preface explains how during 
the war the fools shouted the wise men down, 
and the Dumb Capables proceeded irresistibly 
to the conquest of Europe while the Noisy In- 
capables were making the Empire sick. Review 
later. 

Poems, by William Ernest Henley (274 pages; 
Scribner), gives a sense of the remoteness of 
the poet and his period from that nervous, war- 
ring, introspective world we live in today. Now 
that speed is a permanent fact of modern ex- 
istence we can no longer appreciate its ecstatic 
celebration in Henley's song. 

Chaos, by "Altair" (56 pages; Douglas C. McMur- 
trie, New York), is a vision of eternity in verse 



and pictures. The index of this little essay be- 
gins with Aeronauts and ends with X-rays, and 
what lies between is the marriage of the Heaven 
of William Blake to the Hell of H. G. Wells. 

Captain Zillner, by Rudolf Jeremais Kreutz, trans- 
lated by W. J. Alexander Worster (326 pages; 
Doran), is an Austrian war novel done in the 
flat realism of Tolstoy's Sebastopol. Review 
later. 

Deep Waters, by W. W. Jacobs, (illustrated, 290 
pages; Scribner), collects more of his droll tales 
of seafaring folk unsead. A characteristic vil- 
lage story, Family Cares, marks high-water for 
Mr. Jacobs' inimitable combination of delicate 
extravaganza and authentic humanity. 

Taking the Count, by Charles E. Van Loan (354 
pages; Doran), adds another unfortunately a 
posthumous collection of short stories to the 
author's series of volumes dedicated to Amer- 
ican sports. After the race-track, the links, and 
the diamond it is once more the prize-ring that 
engages his close observation and catholic sym- 
pathy. Honest stories about game men. 

The Chronicle of an Old Town, by Albert Benja- 
min Cunningham, (326 pages; Abingdon Press), 
chronicles a backwater Ohio village through the 
history of an elderly minister's family. Its un- 
important love story, leisurely told, lets the min- 
ister and two other mellow philosophers talk 
rustic wisdom that is richly flavored. 

Mufti, by "Sapper" Cyril McNeile 7 -(303 pages; 
Doran), is an example of English best-seller 
fiction, with an ironic flair for dialogue conspic- 
uously lacking in the American product, and 
with an indifference to happy ending which the 
cisatlantic practitioner does not share. It is an 
adept piece of catering, well prepared. 

Sisters, by Kathleen Norris (342 pages; Doubleday 
Page), rests on the twin pillars of cheap pop- 
ularity the maudlin and the sensational. Its 
author has the satisfaction of knowing that she 
has done and can do infinitely better work. 

Vive La France, by E. B. and A. A. Knipe (364 
pages; Century), is set forth as a narrative 
founded on a diary, at once a novel and an his- 
torical record. It retraces the very familiar 
ground of the invasion of 1914. 

Rainbow Valley, by L. M. Montgomery (341 pages; 
Stokes), is a story in the gentle jog trot between 
sprightly and pastoral; it carries on the tradition 
of the same writer's Anne of Green Gables.

THE AFTERMATH OF WAR 

The Manchester Guardian was founded in 1 82 1 , when men of 
vision, looking beyond the devastation wrought by the Napoleonic 
wars, determined to improve international relationships. 

It became at once a bulwark against reaction. For nearly a century 
it has been recognized as the exponent of that liberalism in Great 
Britain that is greater than party. 

The ocean narrows month by month. The real progressives of 
America are drawn into closer touch with the advanced thinkers of 
Europe.

HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES 
FROM HAYS to McKINLEY 1877-1896 

By JAMES FORD RHODES, LL.D., Litt. D. 

This volume carries Mr. Rhodes' brilliant "History of the United States since the com- 
promise of 1850 through the administrations of Hayes, Garneld, Arthur, Cleveland and 
Harrison. Displaying the learning, sound judgment and literary style which have placed 
him in the front rank of living historians, the author surveys the Railroad Strike of 
1877, the Molly Maguires, Civil Service Reform, the Chinese Question, the Southwestern 
Railroad Strike, the Chicago Riot of 1886, the Financial Depression of 1873 and the 
Panic of 1893. 

In devoting so rnuch attention to the life of the people, political questions and party 
contests have not been ignored. The Tariff Question, for example, is fully considered, 
and how it came to be a party question is carefully told. Thomas B. Reed's rulings as 
Speaker are discussed and the several party connections and presidential campaigns 
receive adequate attention. $2.75.

THE DIAL 



A FORTNIGHTLY 



PHRASE is COMMONER than that which asserts 
that the poet is born not made, and certainly while 
the assertion is not in all respects unimpeachable it 
is at bottom sound enough. Used by the intelligent 
the phrase is taken to mean that whatever the poet 
writes is "inspired"; that he cannot possibly ob- 
tain any control of the strange instrument which 
has been given him; that he is himself, indeed, 
nothing but that instrument, a kind of haunted 
flute, to which from time to time, whether the flute 
wishes it or not, a daemon curves his lip. It is 
easy, too easy, to derive from that hypothesis the 
conclusion that it is useless for the poet to pay 
much heed to technique, that it is impudent of the 
critic to demand of the poet who, poor devil, 
merely does desperately what his daemon flogs 
him forward to do that he should take into ac- 
count either principle or taste, since that is equiva- 
lent to asking his daemon to do so "and what 
does a daemon know of dactyl or homophone?*' 
But the intelligent poet and the intelligent critic, 
though they grant that there must always be at bot- 
tom this daemon of the subconscious, to set the 
waters darkly in motion, will insist that the poet 
should, and can, take his part in the affair. The 
daemon cannot be created; but he can be sum- 
moned, more or less at will, by the muttering of a 
tactful enchantment; with patience, the poet can, 
as it were, train him. And, generally speaking, if 
may be said that a poet grows more or less in pro- 
portion to his achievement of this control. 

But that is not to say that the education of the 
daemon is either safe or easy. It is first of all 
necessary to perceive accurately his true nature, 
and the extent of his abilities; what he is not in 
the beginning fitted to perform he cannot be driven 
to perform, either by cajolery or command. Nor 
is it a simple matter for the poet to understand 
himself in this regard. Few poets have done so. 
Keats did, Heine did, Villon did; Dante also, and 
Shakespeare, and, of a minor sprt again, Mallarme 
and Verlaine. But how many, like Wordsworth 
and Tennyson and Coleridge, have less often un- 



derstood than misunderstood themselves! It is, 
after all, the commonest cause of a poet's failures. 
And the commonest form which this sort of failure 
takes is that in which, clearly enough, the poet has 
mistaken not precisely the character of his daemon 
7 that is not always so likely an error but rather 
its strength, and has set for it a task, or tasks, 
which it cannot possibly, or at any rate adequately, 
perform, tasks beneath which it is likely to become 
deformed or even to die. 

It may be said that every poet, at some point 
or other in his career, encounters this disaster, 
from which he may or may not recover. True, but 
to know at what point in his career this occurs, and 
for what reasons, and to what extent, is of great 
importance it may do much to illuminate for us 
the case of that poet. It is one among many pos- 
sible approaches to any such esthetic problem. For 
some cases it may prove inadequate; for others it 
may supply the essential key. The case of Miss 
Amy Lowell is, I am inclined to think, of the latter 
sort; and it is for that reason that these prelim- 
inary soundings have been taken. 

For Miss Lowell has in this respect only too 
freely put herself into our hands. As I have re- 
marked of her before, she has always emphasized 
the fact that a great deal of the success of a poet 
depends on unremitting hard work; she has, in- 
deed, carried this theory almost to the fetichistic 
extreme to which Flaubert carried it, with his zeal 
for the inevitable word, his patience, with the file. 
From the outset of her poetic career she has 
been aware ef the necessity of educating her dae- 
mon. The question arises therefore whether she 
has properly understood her own abilities; and 
whether, moreover, zeal for the inevitable word or 
patience with the file are of any value save in 
hands instinctively sure. Are Miss Lowell's hands 
instinctively sure? But let us take up the other 
question first, to which the answer will perhaps be 
the answer to both. 

This answer must, I think, be negative. I shall 
not try to press the point too hard, but I think it 
is incontestable that the secret of Miss Lowell's 



332 



THE DIAL 



October 18 



career as a poet has been the fact that from begin- 
ning to end she has misunderstood, overestimated, 
and consistently misdirected her abilities. What 
were, to begin with, her abilities? Not an easy 
question to answer, certainly, even for Miss Lowell, 
if she were resolute; but we must attempt a solu- 
tion, and I think we shall be able to approach it 
by selecting from her new volume, Pictures of the 
Floating World (Macmillan), the poem entitled 
Solitaire, which originally appeared, if I am not 
mistaken, in the first of the Imagist Anthologies: 

When night drifts along the streets of the city, 

And sifts down between the uneven roofs, 

My mind begins to peek and peer. 

It plays at ball in old, blue Chinese gardens, 

And shakes wrought dice-cups in Pagan temples 

Amid the broken flutings of white pillars. 

It dances with purple and yellow crocuses in its hair, 

And its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grasses. 

How light and laughing my mind is, 

When all the good folk have put out their bedroom candles, 

And the city is still! 

The tone of that is clear and unforced; it is a mood 
genuine and delicate, and Miss Lowell has allowed 
it to find expression through exactly the requisite 
simplicity of phrase and rhythm. The mood was 
not only well perceived, it was well felt. Here 
was Miss Lowell's daemon speaking in its own per- 
son, not speaking greatly or profoundly, it is true, 
but speaking at all events with charm and grace, 
on a minor note of magic. And this perhaps is 
at bottom, or should have been, if wisely encour- 
aged, Miss Lowell's true note. For in what other 
work of Miss Lowell, except sporadically and 
brokenly, does one find the same magic? In Pat- 
terns it is now and then perceptible, in the City 
of Falling Leaves, in Vernal Equinox, at the close 
of The Hammers in the passage beginning "Marble 
likeness of an emperor," intermittently in Appul- 
durcombe Park, in Malmaison. Once in a while 
among the many ambitious walls of Miss Lowell's 
later edifices has fallen only for a moment this 
clear soft light, but with how little encouragement 
from Miss Lowell, how little perception, appar- 
ently, of its real value! She is busy again in a 
moment with the divers energies of her many 
paraphernalia for building; walls, roofs, towers, 
kingdoms even, must be erected; and in all this 
bewildering and intoxicating clamor she has little 
time for a visitor so timid and fugitive. Magic 
perches perhaps on the boom of a derrick for an 
instant, but the noise is too much for her she is 
soon gone. 

Miss Lowell has therefore, we may say, been too 
ambitious: she has set her daemon a task out of 
all proportion to its slender strength. This is not 
to say that she has by any means been a failure 
far from it. No, Miss Lowell has both energy and 



cleverness; and, her ambition to be a great poet 
once having been fired, she set these to work with 
results which one must confess are astonishing and 
often delightful. Astonishing, yes, and very enter- 
taining reading, but not great poetry, and in many 
cases not poetry at all. For the point which must 
here be made with severe precision is that the work 
of a poet, if it is to have magic, or be poetry, must 
originally be suggested by the daemon, must be 
"inspired" (objectionable word!), must be gen- 
uinely and obsessively felt, felt through the poet's 
temperament, not merely discovered by the ambi- 
tious explorations of the mind. 'The poet must be 
the victim of the idea, not the idea the victim of 
the poet. Miss Lowell seems to think otherwise. 
She observes: 

The cat and I 

Together in the sultry night 

Waited. 

He greatly desired a mouse; 

I, an idea. 

There you have it! Miss Lowell's mind is restless 
and energetic, and she is determined to write 
poetry, come what may. 

And what is the result? What indeed but that 
Miss Lowell has set herself the most quixotic of 
tasks, namely, the simulation of poetry. One is 
prone to give Miss Lowell so much credit for in- 
telligence that it is difficult to believe that she does 
not perceive the impossibility of this; for while 
it is not impossible to simulate the surfaces of 
poetry, to imitate its technique, to go, as it were, 
through the motions, it is impossible to simulate 
its depths. The mood out of which genuine poetry 
springs is both inevitable and individual, an un- 
foreseeable reaction to an unforeseeable situation. 
Reactions of this sort are reflex, purely instinctive, 
can perhaps be induced, but cannot be compelled. 
I do not mean to say that Miss Lowell never reacts 
in this way. But I do mean to say that her reac- 
tions are few and slight; and that for want of more 
reactions, and reactions more acute, she has in- 
creasingly had recourse to a kind of esthetic falsifi- 
cation. When she is visited by a genuine mood, 
she exaggerates it cold-bloodedly to the point of 
caricature; when the mood denies her its comfort, 
she sets before herself something to which she thinks 
at any rate she should react, painstakingly calling 
to her own attention this or that minute aspect of 
it; with results that are very likely to be excruci- 
ating. 

Of this sort of thing Pictures of the Floating 
World affords manifold evidence: if we except 
her first venture it is the poorest of Miss Lowell's 
books, a book in which she seems almost deliber- 
ately to have paraded her mistakes. Solitaire there 
is, to be sure, and Vernal Equinox, and Appuldur-

combe Park, and To a Certain Critic, and a few 
others among the Lacquer Prints and Chinoiseries 
flute notes clear enough, with a sort of sharp 
variable sweetness. But for the most part the book 
is of that sort which any sensitive judge must pro- 
nounce clever but dull. These are not poems, but 
the simulacra of poems. With what desperation 
Miss Lowell, in her determination to be original, 
flogs her poor vocabulary, rifles Roget for epithets, 
chops her lines to a sort of poetic mincemeat, re- 
sorts to effeminate expletives! And all to achieve 
only a sterility somewhat oddly freaked and 
brindled. It is not enough merely to observe 
bizarre details; it is not enough to sprinkle a page 
or poem with unfamiliar words. Details must be 
introduced naturally or not at all; they must be 
the details on which the mood seizes, not merely 
details which are scientifically true. Words must 
be used instinctively or not at all; they must be 
the words on which the mood seizes, not merely 
words which, to the calculating cold eye, seem clever. 
Miss Lowell sins repeatedly in these matters. The 
note is forced, histrionic; the approach is not 
poetic so much as scientific ; she seeks to overwhelm 
by an accumulation of minutely accurate details, 
a crepitating 1 literality. At its best this method 
produces merely such a freezing harmlessness as 
the dahlias "meticulously quilled"; at its worst it 
becomes an unendurable falsetto, as when the stars 
are compared to languid pulses "squeezed through 
a mist." This sort of thing is the plainest of char- 
latanry, inexcusable even if Miss Lowell is herself 
the dupe of it. 

The fact therefore becomes clear, in this volume, 
that Miss Lowell has attempted poetry on a scale for 



which she is better suited by intellect than by tem- 
perament, but for which neither is truly adequate. 
Compelled to become a "conscious artist" by her 
lack of a rich emotivity, compelled further, as a 
"conscious artist," by the lack of a fine sensibility, 
to fall back on sheer cleverness, Miss Lowell has 
sought one theory after another like so many 
nostrums free verse, the unrelated method, poly- 
phonic prose all^ in the end, to achieve a poetry 
full no doubt of esthetic shock, but almost totally 
lacking in the warmth or magic or beauty which 
is the contribution of the subconscious. The touch 
is coarse; the technique is clumsy: she descends 
from a flash of insight to the fatuities of an after- 
noon tea. She has her good moments, it is true. 
Her grotesques are sometimes excellent. But even 
these are only too often overwrought to the point of 
absurdity, end in bathos or on a note of flatness. 
Perhaps, after all, Miss Lowell came nearest to 
finding her true level in polyphonic prose: had 
the polyphonic element in Can Grande's Castle 
been subdued, or even eliminated, the four narra- 
tives in that book might have been superb. For a 
temperament in which energy is the dominant char- 
acteristic a temperament adapted to a rich en- 
vironment, and thereby, through a sort of abrasion, 
superficially refined, but not by nature finely per- 
ceptive or exquisitely sensitive it shoald, I think, 
be clear that prose rather than poetry is the suit- 
able instrument; for the prose writer can more 
safely and more extensively than the poet set about 
the self-cultivation which enriches the "conscious 
artist." It is only the genius among poets who 
knows how to grow.

Liberalism in Japan 

II. THE ECONOMIC FACTOR 



I 



N MY PREVIOUS ARTICLE I discusssed the intel- 
lectual change which is furthering the growth of 
liberalized institutions in Japan. The word "meta- 
physical" was ventured upon in describing the 
change. I can imagine the scorn with which some 
greet the idea that intellectual changes can lead 
to political changes. People love to stand on their 
heads intellectually, and so it is that the Marxians 
who have given the world its best modern demon- 
stration of the power of ideas and of intellectual 
leadership, are the ones who most deny that these 
things have any efficacy. Even the most hardened 
upholder of the impotency of intellectual and moral 
forces might however concede that without certain 



changes of mental attitude and disposition, there 
are certain alterations of society which cannot be 
accomplished, that intellectual changes are at least 
a negative condition, a sine qua non. And this con- 
cession will be met not with an admission but an 
assertion that it is fortunate for the prospects of 
liberalism in Japan that the intellectual modifica- 
tions already dealt with are accompanied and rein- 
forced by active and aggressive economic changes. 
The war tremendously hastened the industrial 
transition in Japan. In 1918 alone the number of 
factories in Tokyo doubled in spite of extraordi- 
nary increases in prior years. The last five years 
have practically transformed Japan from an agra- 



334

rian into an industrial state. For there is today ac- 
tual shortage of farm labor in that country, although 
the wages of farm hands have more than doubled. 
The urban factories have been absorbing labor at 
such a rate that for the time being at least the old 
plea for territorial expansion to take up the growth 
of populaton does not hold. In consequence of 
this expedited development Japan has been plunged 
into the labor problem and plunged with exceed- 
ingly little preparation. 

The remote and speculative observer is given to 
supposing that a new country which is undergoing 
the industrial revolution at this late date will surely 
learn from the experience of the other countries 
that passed through it earlier. Why wait for all the 
evils of child labor, woman's labor, long hours, un- 
sanitary factores, congested housing, slums, and so 
forth to show themselves, when experience has 
demonstrated how surely they follow upon a lais- 
sez-faire policy, and also how legislation and ad- 
ministration may at least alleviate their worst evils? 
Especially would it seem as if a paternalistic gov- 
ernment like that of Japan would do something, if 
only because of the general influence exercised by 
her model, Germany. But practically no foresight 
was manifested. Certain factory laws on the Western 
pattern were indeed passed, but their execution was 
postponed for a term of years up to twelve on 
the plea of giving capital a chance to adjust itself. 
As a matter of fact, greed for immediate profits 
irrespective of ultimate results has taken possession 
of industrial Japan. 

This individualistic force has been reinforced by 
what seems to me the most harmful force at work 
in Japan impatient hurry to become a Great 
Power at once. The Japanese know very well that 
a modern Great Power requires developed industry 
and wealth. Consequently they have "drawn the 
great red-ink overdraft on the future." Its states- 
men have believed that the interests of the nation 
coincided with the get-rich-quick desires of indi- 
viduals, and have not only not tried to regulate 
them but have encouraged them. The most en- 
lightening answer received to the question asked by 
every foreign visitor as to the difference of political 
parties in Japan was that the party in power was 
the Mitsui party, while its rival was the Mitsubishi 
party. Japan has its "big six" corporations which 
combine banking, shipping, mining, manufacturing, 
and continental exploitation in their various activi- 
ties. Of the six, the Mitsuis and Mitsubishis are 
the richest and most powerful, the others being 
grouped about them. By direct intermarriage as 
well as in countless indirect ways, these big business 
interests are woven into the administration of the 
state. In fact, they on one side and the military 



and naval clans on the other are the State. Perhaps 
the greatest enlightenment I received as to practical 
politics in Japan was upon being told that the big 
business interests did not as such interfere in the 
Parliamentary elections. They did not care par- 
ticularly what individuals were elected, for they 
did business direct with the political over-lords. 
The story of the alliance of big business and poli- 
tics in Japan would require a book not a para- 
graph. Hence there is not much use in citing 
isolated illustrative facts. But certain items in their 
system of taxation may be taken as typical. A pri- 
vate individual pays a seven per cent income tax 
when his income reaches seven hundred and fifty 
dollars. A corporation pays only seven and a half 
per cent, on an income of half a million. Chapters 
could not say more as to where control lies in 
Japan. The theory is that the private individual 
can do little to make Japan a strong world-power. 
Big concentrations of capital can really push Japan 
ahead in building up trade and industry for world 
competition. And newspapers which devote col- 
umns to general denunciation of the government 
rarely condescend to discuss the significance of 
such facts as this. 

During the discussions by the Japanese news- 
papers of the League of Nations, they were wont 
to say that Japan represented the cause of labor, 
while the Western nations, especially Great Britain 
and the United States, represented capitalism. But 
there is' no modern state in which capitalism has 
such unresisted and almost unquestioned power as 
in Japan today. The fear of the League of Nations 
as an agency of capitalistic exploitations was in fact 
a fear of one organization of capital by another 
especially with reference to the development of 
Siberia and China. 

It was a cynical Japanese there aren't many 
who told me that Japan's factory legislation was 
solely for the benefit of the Westerner. Being tired 
of telling curious visiting foreigners that Japan had 
no labor laws, they put some on the statute-book 
and suspended their execution for the most part. 
The former fact is advertised and the latter con- 
cealed unless the visitor is unusually inquisitive. 
But the effect of this absence of regulation in con- 
junction with the rapid development of industry 
and trade during the past five years has been what 
every Westerner would have foretold. The labor 
crisis has arrived and it is unmitigated, acute. The 
allegedly more liberal Kara government at present 
in power has not authorized the formation of trade 
unions, but it has suspended the enforcement of the 
ban they are under. They now exist in a dim twi- 
light zone, neither forbidden nor legalized. How 
numerous they are a visitor like myself has no way

of knowing. One young radical Japanese told me 
that Japan was honeycombed with them, even while 
they were illegal, that even farm hands were union- 
izing, and that the police no longer reported them 
because the police had themselves been infected 
with "dangerous ideas" a technical term in Japan 
as well as in certain respectable circles in the 
United States. 

In intellectual circles there is animated discussion 
of whether Japan must in its economic development 
pass through the stage of antagonism of capital and 
labor characteristic of Western development. There 
is an influential section, representing the old Con- 
fucianist oligarchy, which holds that it is not neces- 
sary. They conceive that the old feudal principle 
of master and man, of protection and dependence, 
can be carried over into the modern relation of 
employer and employee. They do not content them- 
selves with making appeals to the former to treat 
their employees better, to assume paternalistic re- 
sponsibilities. There are countless societies in 
existence, under the control of employers, for health 
insurance, sick funds, promoting the welfare of la- 
borers, and so forth. This is known technically as 
the principle of "kindness." The liberals who have 
come most under the influence of Western ideas 
contend that the principle is only a belated feudal 
relic and is bound to fail. They hold that it is 
morally as well as economically necessary for the 
laborers to assert themselves; that they cannot de- 
velop unless they organize and win their rights for 
themselves, instead of accepting concessions from 
benevolent patrons. This is known as the principle 
of "rights." But the feudalists of the chosen, 
unique-nation type counter by saying that it is only 
the materialism of the West that has made the devel- 
opment of industry take the form of struggle for 
liberties and rights; that the superior moral stand- 
ards of the Orient are capable of applying the prin- 
ciple of kindness and sympathy to the growth of 
industrial relations and thus escaping the class war 
which has disgraced Western civilization. The Bol- 
sheviks, of course, come in usefully here as well 
as elsewhere. 

But for the moment at least the case is going 
against the upholders of the doctrine of "kindness." 
The rice riots were the signal of the beginning of 
labor and class-consciousness. The high cost of 
living is even a more acute issue in Japan than 
elsewhere. Japan has to import a considerable part 
of its food supply, and rice is not, like wheat, a 
world staple. It is conceivable that the future des- 
tiny of Japan turns upon this fact, for rice costs 
twelve times what it cost thirty years ago, and over 
three times what it did at the beginning of the war. 



Meantime there are all the usual consequences of 
change from the relative isolation of rural life to 
close contacts in cities and factories. On every 
side there are stories of increasing and active fric- 
tion in shops and factories between foremen and 
laborers, and as I write there is a perfect epidemic 
of strikes. The rise in wages has in no sense kept 
pace with the increase in the cost of living ; and the 
evidences of millionaires new-made from war 
profiteering abound on every hand. Japan is 
plunged suddenly and with practically no prepara- 
tion, administrative or intellectual, into the most 
acute labor problem. Socialism is under the ban; 
a socialistic party is legally a criminal conspiracy 
and is treated as such. But according to all reports 
the interest in socialism is growing with remarkable 
rapidity. 

In one of the private universities a teacher gave 
his class in advanced political economy a chance to 
vote as to whether they would not take up for study 
Commercial Expansion, Labor Movements, or So- 
cialism. The vote was a hundred for the last topic, 
to three for the first. Considering the avidity of 
the Japanese for practical topics and the zeal for 
commercial expansion it is safe to say that before 
the war the figures would have been reversed. The 
younger generation of students is becoming infected 
with radical ideas. The Imperial University is often 
thought to be the home of intellectual conservatism. 
A group of its students are publishing a journal 
called Democracy. Some of its professors are the 
most active members of a society called The Dawn, 
which is openly carrying on propaganda by public 
lectures for democratic ideas. Magazines with titles 
like Reconstruction, The New Society, are born al- 
most every month. During the time of the previous 
cabinet, when police supervision was more rigid 
than now, a judge was convicted of lese majeste^ 
because in attacking the bureaucratic militarists he 
had said that by coming between the people and the 
Emperor they tarnished the glory of the Emperor. 
The suggestion that the Emperor could be tarnished 
was enough to send him to jail, but his standing 
and his influence were increased by the episode. 
A number of like cases could be cited. There have 
been of late many arrests for possession and circu- 
lation of "revolutionary" literature. There are even 
those who prophesy a political revolution on an 
economic basis in Japan within the next five years. 
But they seem to me too sanguine. 

Serious as is the situation with labor, it is even 
more serious with the middle class. So far the in- 
dustrial revolution in Japan does not run true to 
form. It is not creating a bourgeoisie, but rather 
undermining that which Japan used to possess. The

Marxian division into the proletariat and the 
millionaire is rapidly going on. The old hand 
points out to you as significant that the numerous 
autos seen on the streets of Tokyo are of the Rolls- 
Royce and Pierce- Arrow type; Fords are conspicu- 
ous by their absence. In the country districts, peas- 
ant proprietorship is on the wane; large and absen- 
tee landownership is on the increase. The average 
land holding is about the three acres; this hardly 
supports a family. Since it leaves no rice to sell, 
the high price of rice does not help the small 
farmer. Consequently concentration of land as well 
as of other forms of capital is rapidly proceeding. 

Japan has had for some time an educated prole- 
tariat, which it has characteristically nicknamed the 
"European-clothes poor." So far as minor offi- 
cials, police, clerks, and primary school teachers are 
concerned, this middle class has been the most 
staunch supporter of bureaucracy and militarism. 
But it recently tasted the bitterness of being a 
salaried class when the cost of living was leaping. 
Wages have increased; salaries hardly at all. The 
police begin to agitate, and the Government did 
something for them ; their position was too strategic 
to take chances. The primary school teachers called 
meetings for discussion in Tokyo and Yokahama; 
the police, acting under governmental instructions, 
forbade and then broke up the meetings. A news- 
paper commenting on the situation asked what 
would be the effect upon pupils when teachers in 
.school taught conventional ethics, while out of 
school the teachers went contrary to the ethics they 
taught? In other words, the burden of what is 
termed "ethics" in, the primary schools is submis- 
sion to authority, while out of school the teachers 
were guilty of going contrary to authority in agi- 
tating to force the authorities to give them a living 
wage. The middle class does not of course possess 
the weight in mass of the laboring class, but it is 
quite likely that, with its greater education, its 
weaning from the cause of autocracy to which it has 
been devoted will have the earlier political results. 

The observer can follow the progress of the cause 
of democracy in Japan by certain outward signs. 
The first and in many ways the most superficial will 
be the extension of universal suffrage. The last 
Parliament passed a bill about doubling the electo- 
rate. It was a compromise measure that gave no satis- 
faction to either the conservatives or the radicals. 
Unless foreign relations monopolize attention, the 
struggle will be renewed in the next Parliament. 
The second sign, and a more significant one, will be 
a conflict, occasioned either through the extension 
of suffrage or some similar question, between the 
lower house and the upper. For the House of Peers 



was deliberately invented to give the old oligarchy 
and the new plutocracy power to prevent extrava- 
gances in the popular direction on the part of the 
lower house. An even more serious sign will be the 
determined effort to make the ministers of war and 
navy real members of the Cabinet, instead of privi- 
leged appointees of the Army and Navy with inde- 
pendent and irresponsible jurisdiction. How far 
their independence goes came out in a way which 
would have been most embarrassing in any country 
except Japan in the closing days of the last Par- 
liament. It was necessary to get the approval of 
the budget of expenditures of the various govern- 
mental departments. That of the War Department 
called for extra wages to one hundred and fifty 
thousand soldiers who had been on service in Si- 
beria. Yet the Foreign Office had had a distinct un- 
derstanding with other governments that only from 
seven to ten thousand men, a number proportionate 
to the army of the other Allies, would be. sent. 
There was a temporary excitement, the House went 
into secret session, the money was voted, and a few 
days later there appeared in the newspapers a semi- 
official statement that the number in Siberia had 
not exceeded seventy thousand. No outsider, and 
not many insiders, will ever know what the other 
eighty thousand were paid for. But the meaning of 
an independent minister of war in a government 
that is said by propagandists in foreign countries to 
be constitutional is measured by the fact that he 
could act in such contravention to the direct pledge 
of the minister of foreign affairs. Numerous such 
cases appear, especially in connection with Chinese 
affairs; and it is of course impossible to tell how 
much is collusion with a chance to prove an alibi 
on the part of supposedly liberal ministers, and how 
much is due to the undoubted power of the Minister 
of War (in effect the General Staff) to act without 
the rest of the "Government's" knowing anything 
about it. Other convincing signs of the spread of 
democratic ideas will be a movement for respon- 
sibility of the ministry to the Parliament instead of 
to the Emperor which means in effect to the Clans- 
men who constitute Elder Statesmen, and for real 
legislative initiative on the part of the Parliament. 
For one has to be near the scene to learn that no 
important bills ever even receive consideration in 
the Parliament unless they have received a permit 
from the Privy Council a secret and irresponsible 
body. The canceling of the power of the policy 
without judicial action or review, to suppress news- 
papers will be a most hopeful sign. 

However, it is not likely that affairs will move in 
such a logical sequence as has been outlined. It is 
more likely that something will happen and a gen-

eral change in the political structure take place all 
at once. Yet while in its effect, in its consequence, 
this happening will be a revolution, it is hard to 
imagine a happening in Japan such as we usually 
associate with the word "Revolution." There is some 
quality in the Japanese inscrutable to a foreigner 
which makes them at once the most rigid and the 
most pliable people on earth, the most self-satisfied 
and the most eager to learn. It is wholly conceiv- 
able that, with the development of democratic senti- 
ment, a dramatic change may suddenly take place 
comparable to the transfer in the sixties of power 
from the old Tokugawa Shogunate to the Satsuma 
and Choshu clansmen, and the consequent central- 
ized unification of Japan and the surrender of the 
policy of isolation. To the student of history it now 
looks very much as if Japan in the seventies and 



eighties had been very much in flux, and as if with 
slight changes in the course of events Japan might 
then have become a genuine and not a simulated 
constitutional state. But unfortunately in the 
eighties Europe generally entered upon the im- 
perialistic path, and in the later eighties Japan de- 
liberately adopted from Germany a militarized 
state, a constitution which gave the form without 
the substance of a representative government, and 
a universal primary education calculated to produce 
what a young Japanese student of English called 
"obeyfulness," and a secondary and higher system 
aiming at specialized efficiency in the service of the 
state. The' development of liberation was put in 
abeyance for thirty years. 

JOHN DEWEY. 



An Ancient Cynic 



JLHERE is A popular parlor-game known in this 
country as Gossip. It is a harmless little psycho- 
logical diversion, and it is played approximately 
as follows: One of the company, usually chosen 
by lot, whispers a short sentence in his neighbor's 
ear, such as "All men are liars," or "A rolling 
stone gathers no moss." This sentence, or as much 
of it as is audible, is repeated by the person re- 
ceiving it to the person sitting next to him, who in 
turn passes it on secretly to his neighbor. After 
going the whispered rounds of the assembled com- 
pany, which is seated in a circle, the original re- 
mark reaches the ears of the first whisperer. He 
thereupon announces his own statement and its 
surprising metamorphosis, which usually has taken 
some such form as "A barking dog never bites" or 
"A fool and his money are soon parted"; there is 
a loud burst of laughter from everyone, a noisy 
scraping of chairs, and a hasty dash for the lem- 
onade. 

In some such way, only on a more magnificent 
scale, ancient history reaches our ears. We flatter 
ourselves tihat we know the secrets which the past 
has whispered to us, when as a matter of fact we 
are ignorant of most of its most public matters. 
When we realize, however, that in the parlor-game 
Gossip the players not only speak the same lang- 
uage but refrain from deliberately falsifying what 
they hear, and when we realize furthermore that 
their game usually occupies less than one hundred 
seconds, we are not astonished so much as shocked 
that another game, occupying two thousand years, 
conducted in three different languages, and played 
by a company of ecclesiastical demagogues, should 
end with even more amazing and divergent results. 

For playing detective in the back parlor of the 



Church, Morris Jastrow, Jr., has won, or must 
eventually win, the gratitude of every man who 
has a weakness for the truth. In the foreword to 
his book A Gentle Cynic (Lippincott, Philadel- 
phia) he states his intention of doing unto the 
Book of Job and the Song of Songs as he has 
done unto the so-called Book of Ecclesiastes. If 
he fulfills this intention he will not have many 
friends left in the right wing of Christendom. 
But the left wing, at any rate, will flutter for 
him proudly. And all the heathen seekers after 
historic fact will, it is certain, welcome him into 
their fold and call him Brother. For Mr. Jastrow 
has not merely acted as dragoman between the 
ancient Hebrew and the modern Englishman; he 
has not merely given us a literal, unadorned 
translation of a work commonly and wrongly 
attributed to King Solomon; he has exhibited the 
whole twisted policy of Ecclesiastical buncombe 
which runs like a muddy stream through the green 
pastures of ancient literatures. He has given 
us, probably for the first time in 2200 years, 
the acid, unsweetened philosophy of Koholeth, 
who styled himself King over Israel in Jerusalem. 
Some of the blame for the sweetening process 
which the sayings of this ancient cynic have un- 
dergone he lays, by implication, at the doors and 
the dictionaries of the Greek translators. At 
least Mr. Jastrow points out, with a finger never 
weary in well-doing, that the second book of the 
Pentateuch was called, in the Hebrew, Shemoth, 
meaning "Names," which the Greek pundits, in 
a free flight of the imagination, passed down to 
us as Exodus. Again, the book known to us as 
Lamentations was called, in the original Hebrew, 



338 



THE DIAL 



October 18 



Echa, meaning "Alas!," which merely was the 
first word occurring in that book of tears. Still 
again, the book which we now know as Ecclesiastes 
was so baptized by these same pundits, with the 
excuse that an Ecclesia is an assembly, and that 
the root of the Hebrew name Koholeth is derived 
from a verb meaning "to assemble." Now, though 
Koholeth was undoubtedly a nom-de-plume, the 
man who had adopted it did so for definite rea- 
sons. The Book of Ecclesiastes is actually the 
Book of Koholeth. To bungle that fact in trans- 
lation is not only to play fast and loose with an 
historical detail but also to throw doubt on the 
scientific scrupulousness of the rest of the work in 
a field of endeavor in which carelessness is as 
inexcusable as it is in a dynamite plant. 

Most of his censure, however, Mr. Jastrow levels 
at the ancient Hebraic moralists themselves. In 
the ante-Christian era authorship in Israel was 
practically unheard of. Disciples and followers 
took the place of typewriters and printing-presses. 
Jesus Christ, as we know, never wrote down his 
philosophy of gentleness; it was collated and 
edited by his Apostles. Indeed, his forerunner 
by only a hundred-odd years, Jesus Ben Sira, was 
one of the first men to give the world a work to 
which he definitely affixed his name. The inevitable 
was the result no man's creed was a stable thing. 
It was mouthed, and in the mouthing often marred, 
by the men who succeeded him. Even if he af- 
fixed it to parchment his words were emendated 
to meet the varying customs of the day. 

This is what happened to Koholeth. His cyn- 
icism was out of temper with his times. His doc- 
trines were dangerous. He was a sans-culotte, and 
Jacobins were as unpopular then as now. Yet his 
writings had an undoubted vogue among the Zen- 
diks of the age. He wielded an influence. People 
liked the taste of his teachings. They repeated 
after him, "Vanity, vanity, all is vanity"; and 
the phrase lay pleasantly on their tongues. What 
was to be done with this heretic who stirred up 
the people and put dynamite under the temples of 
their simple faiths? The answer will be found in 
the additions which were shrewdly added to Koho- 
leth's original text, and which are found today in 
every Bible. In brief, the mysterious Koholeth 
was too powerful a personage to be suppressed 
altogether so he was merely emendated. One 
sixth of the Book of Ecclesiastes is comprised 
of these moral additions ecclesiastical and po- 
litical demulcents smeared over his work to soften 
its sting. , 

Two or three examples of such methods of 
ancient literary prophylaxis are all that may be 
included here. Koholeth, for example, says: "I 



set out to experience frivolity and foolishness, 
though I knew that this, too, was chasing after 
wind." Whereupon a pious commentator, horri- 
fied at the idea that a man whom tradition had 
connected with King Solomon should deliberately 
set out to experience frivolity and foolishness, 
modified this cynical teaching by adding the 
clause "wisdom and knowledge" and thus mor- 
ally saved the day. Again, Koholeth remarks: 
"There is nothing better for a man than that he 
should eat and drink a hedonistic idea which 
occasioned the hurried inclusion of the subsequent- 
ly-penned moral maxim (I here follow the King 
James version and not Mr. Jastrow's) "For God 
giveth to a man that is good in His sight wis- 
dom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner 
he giveth travail." There are dozens of these 
instances, many even more startling in their phil- 
osophic anachronism. Mr. Jastrow goes after 
them all. He makes you sit up in your pew. He 
makes you suddenly aware that all games of 
gossip are not played in parlors, and that laughter 
and lemonade are not always appropriate dishes 
after the denouement. 

But it is not as a judge so much as an honest 
workman finishing a hitherto botched job that he 
deserves unqualified praise. His explanation of 
how Ecclesiastes came to be included among the 
sacred writings of the East, his examination of 
Koholeth's philosophy, his demonstration that Ko- 
holeth's, saying "Cast thy bread upon the face of 
the waters for after many days thou shall find 
it" was less a maxim preaching generosity than 
a shrewd business slogan urging men into broader 
fields of trade, - his tracing of the belief which 
attributed Koholeth's writings to King Solomon, 
his exposure of the fact that Koholeth believed 
no more in a future existence than did the Psalm- 
ist who declared that the dead can not praise God 
in Sheol these exegetical additions to his original 
translations, with several dozens like them, make 
Mr. Jastrow's work a book of unparalleled in- 
terest in the realm of critico-historical literature. 

It is Koholeths' text itself, however, that claims 
our first 'attention and our last. Stripped of 
all ancient and modern moralizings, it gives us 
for the first time the bare bones of the old cynic 
a man who once loved life and accused that love of 
stupidity; a man to whom, in the end, everything 
was vanity, and existence a foolish "chasing after 

wind."

Bolshevism and the Vested Interests in America 

II. ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAKE FOR A CHANGE 



A HE STATE OF INDUSTRY, in America and in the 
other advanced industrial countries, will impose 
certain exacting conditions on any movement that 
aims to displace the Vested Interests. These condi- 
tions lie in the nature of things; that is to say, in 
the nature of the existing industrial system; and 
until they are met in some passable fashion, this 
industrial system can not be taken over in ,any 
effectual or enduring manner. And it is plain that 
whatever is found to be true in these respects for 
America will also hold true in much the same 
degree for the other countries that are dominated 
by the mechanical industry and the system of ab- 
sentee ownership. 

It may also confidently be set down at the outset 
that such an impartial review of the evidence as 
is here aimed at will make it appear that there 
need be no present apprehension of the Vested 
Interests' being unseated by any popular uprising 
in America, even if the popular irritation should 
rise very appreciably above its present pitch, and 
even if certain advocates of "direct action," here 
and there, should be so ill-advised as to make some 
rash gesture of revolt. The only present danger is 
that a boisterous campaign of repression and inqui- 
sition on the part of the Guardians of the Vested 
Interests may stir up some transient flutter of sedi- 
tious disturbance. 

To this end, then, it will be necessary to recall, 
in a summary way, those main facts of the indus- 
trial system and of the present businesslike control 
of this system which come immediately into the 
case. By way of general premise it is to be noted 
that the established order of business rests on ab- 
sentee ownership and is managed with an eye single 
to the largest obtainable net return in terms of 
price; that is to say, it is a system of businesslike 
management on a commercial footing. The under- 
lying population is dependent on the working of 
this industrial system for its livelihood; and their 
material interest therefore centers in the output 
and distribution of consumable goods, not in an 
increasing volume of earnings for the absentee 
owners. Hence there is a division of interest be- 
tween the business community, who do business for 
the absentee owners, and the underlying popula- 
tion, who work for a living; and in the nature of 
the case this division* of interest between the ab- 
sentee owners and the underlying population is 
growing wider and more evident from day to day; 



which engenders a certain division of sentiment 
and a degree of mutual distrust. With it all the 
underlying population are still in a sufficiently de- 
ferential frame of mind toward their absentee own- 
ers and are quite conscientiously delicate about 
any abatement of the free income which their 
owners come in for, according to the rules of the 
game as it is played. 

The business concerns which so have the man- 
agement of industry of this plan of absentee own- 
ership are capitalized on their business capacity, 
not on their industrial capacity ; that is to say, they 
are capitalized on their capacity to produce earn- 
ings, not on their capacity to produce goods. Their 
capitalization has, in effect, been calculated and 
fixed on the highest ordinary rate of earnings pre- 
viously obtained; and on pain of insolvency their 
businesslike managers are now required to meet 
fixed income-charges on this capitalization. There- 
fore, as a proposition of safe and sane business 
management, prices have to be maintained or ad- 
vanced. 

From this businesslike requirement of meeting 
these fixed overhead charges on the capitalization 
there result certain customary lines of waste and 
obstruction, which are unavoidable so long as in- 
dustry is managed by businesslike methods and 
for businesslike ends. These ordinary lines of 
waste and obstruction are necessarily (and blame- 
lessly) included in the businesslike conduct of pro- 
duction. They are many and various in detail, but 
they may for convenience be classed under four 
heads: (a) Unemployment of material resources, 
equipment, and manpower, in whole or in part, 
deliberately or through ignorance; (b) Salesman- 
ship (includes, e. g., needless multiplication of 
merchants and shops, wholesale and retail, news- 
paper advertising and bill-boards, sales-exhibits, 
sales-agents, fancy packages and labels, adultera- 
tion, multiplication of brands and proprietary arti- 
cles) ; (c) Production (and sales-cost) of superflui- 
ties and spurious goods; (d) Systematic dislocation, 
sabotage and duplication, due in part to businesslike 
strategy, in part to businesslike ignorance of indus- 
trial requirements (includes, e.g., such things as 
cross-freights, monopolization of resources, with- 
holding of facilities and information from business 
rivals whom it is thought wise to- hinder or defeat) . 
There is, of course, no blame, and no sense of 
blame or shame attaching to all this everyday waste

and confusion that goes to make up the workday 
total of businesslike management. All of it is a 
legitimate and necessary part of the established 
order of business enterprise, within the law and 
within the ethics of the trade. 

Salesmanship is the most conspicuous, and per- 
haps the gravest, of these wasteful and industrially 
futile practices that are involved in the business- 
like conduct of industry; it bulks large both in its 
immediate cost and in its meretricious conse- 
quences. It also is altogether legitimate and in- 
dispensable in any industrial business that deals 
with customers, in buying or selling; which comes 
near saying, in all business that has to do with the 
production or distribution of goods or services. 
Indeed, salesmanship is, in a way, the whole end 
and substance of business enterprise; and except 
so far as it is managed with a constant view to 
profitable bargains, the production of goods is 
not a business proposition. It is the elimination 
of profitable transactions of purchase and sale that 
is hoped for by any current movement looking to 
an overturn, and it is the same elimination of pro- 
fitable bargaining that is feared, with a nerve- 
shattering fear, by the Guardians of the established 
order. Salesmanship is also the most indispensable 
and most meritorious of those qualities that go to 
make a safe and sane business man. 

It is doubtless within the mark to say that, at 
an average, one-half the price paid for goods and 
services by consumers is to be set down to the ac- 
count of salesmanship that is, to sales-cost and 
to the net gains of salesmanship. But in many 
notable lines of merchandise the sales-cost will 
ordinarily foot up to some ten or twenty times the 
production-cost proper, and to not less than one 
hundred times the necessary cost of distribution. 
All this is not a matter for shame or distaste. In 
fact, just now more than ever, there is a clamorous 
and visibly growing insistence on the paramount 
merit and importance of salesmanship as the main 
stay of commerce and industry, and a strenuous 
demand for more extensive and more thorough 
training in salesmanship of a larger number of 
young men at the public expense to enable a 
shrewdly limited output of good to be sold at more 
profitable prices at the public cgst. So also 
there is a visibly increasing expenditure on all 
manner of advertising; and the spokesmen of this 
enterprise in conspicuous waste are "pointing with 
pride" to the fact that the American business com- 
munity have already spent upward of $600,000,000 
on bill-boards alone within the past year, not to 
speak of much larger sums spent on newspapers 
and other printed matter for the same purpose 
and the common man pays the cost. 



At the same time advertising and manoeuvres of 
salesmanlike spell-binding appear to be the only 
resource to which the country's business men know 
how to turn for relief from that tangle of difficul- 
ties into which the outbreak of a businesslike peace 
has precipitated the commercialized world. In- 
creased sales-cost is to remedy the evils of under- 
production. In this connection it may be worth 
while to recall, without heat or faultfinding, that 
all the costly publicity that goes into sales-costs 
is in the nature of prevarication, when it is not 
good broad mendacity; and quite unnecessarily so. 
And all the while the proportion of sales-costs to 
production-costs goes on increasing, and the cost of 
living grows continually greater for the underly- 
ing population, and business necessities continue 
to enlarge the necessary expenditure on ways and 
means of salesmanship. 

It is reasonable to believe that this state of 
things, which has been coming on gradually for 
some time past, will in time come to be understood 
and appreciated by the underlying population, at 
least in some degree. And it is likewise reason- 
able to believe that so soon as the underlying pop- 
ulation come to realize that all this wasteful traffic 
of salesmanship is using up their productive forces, 
with nothing better to show for it than an increased 
cost of living, they will be driven to make some 
move to abate the nuisance. And just so far as 
this state of things is now beginning to be under- 
stood, its logical outcome is a growing distrust of 
the business men and all their works and words. 
But the underlying population is still very credu- 
lous about anything that is said or done in the 
name of Business, and there need be no apprehen- 
sion of a mutinous outbreak, just yet. But at the 
same time it is evident that any plan of manage- 
ment which could contrive to dispense with all 
this expenditure on salesmanship, or that could 
materially reduce sales-costs, would have that 
much of a free margin to go on, and therefore that 
much of an added chance of success; and so also 
it is evident that any other than a businesslike 
management could so contrive, inasmuch as sales- 
costs are incurred solely for purposes of business, 
not for purposes of industry; they are incurred for 
the sake of private gain, not for the sake of pro- 
ductive work. 

But there is in fact no present promise of a 
breakdown of business, due to the continued in- 
crease of sales-costs; although sales-costs are 
bound to go on increasing so long as the country's 
industry continues to be managed on anything like 
the present plan. In fact, salesmanship is the chief 
factor in that ever-increasing cost of living, which 
is in its turn the chief ground of prosperity among 



1919

341 



the business community and the chief source of 
perennial hardship and discontent among the un- 
derlying population. Still it is worth noting that 
the eventual elimination of salesmanship and sales- 
cost would lighten the burden of workday produc- 
tion for the underlying population by some fifty 
per cent. There is that much of a visible induce- 
ment to disallow that system of absentee ownership 
on which modern business enterprise rests; and 
for what it may be worth it is to be admitted that 
there is therefore that much of a drift in the exist- 
ing state of things toward a revolutionary overturn 
looking to the unseating of the Vested Interests. 
But at the same time the elimination of salesman- 
ship and all its voluminous apparatus and traffic 
would also cut down the capitalized income of the 
business cemmunity by something like one-half; 
and that contingency is not to be contemplated, 
not to say with equanimity, by the Guardians; and 
it is after all in the hands of these Guardians that 
the fortunes of the community rest. Such a move 
is a moral impossibility, just yet. 

Closely related to the wasteful practices of sales- 
manship as commonly understood, if it should not 
rather be counted in as an extension of salesman- 
ship, is that persistent unemployment of men, 
equipment, and material resources, by which the 
output of goods and services is kept down to the 
"requirements of the market," with a view to main- 
taining prices at a "reasonably profitable level." 
Such unemployment, deliberate and habitual, is 
one of the ordinary expedients employed in the 
businesslike management of industry. There is 
always more or less of it in ordinary times. "Rea- 
sonable earnings" could not be assured without it; 
because "what the traffic will bear" in the way of an 
output of goods is by no means the same as the pro- 
ductive capacity of the industrial system; still less 
is it the same as the total consumptive needs of the 
community; in fact, it does not visibly tend to 
coincide with either. It is more particularly in 
times of popular distress, such as the present year, 
when the current output of goods is not nearly 
sufficient to cover the consumptive needs of the 
community, that considerations of business strategy 
call for a wise unemployment of the country's 
productive forces. At the same time, such business- 
like unemployment of equipment and man power 
is the most obvious cause of popular distress. 

All this is well known to the Guardians of the 
Vested Interests, and their knowledge of it is, quite 
reasonably, a source of uneasiness to them. But 
they see no help for it; and indeed there is no help 
for it within the framework of "business as usual," 
since it is the essence of business as usual. So also, 



the Guardians are aware that this businesslike 
sabotage on productive industry is a fruitful source 
of discontent and distrust among the underlying 
population who suffer the inconvenience of it all; 
and they are beset with the abiding fear that the 
underlying population may shortly be provoked into 
disallowing those Vested Interests for whose benefit 
this deliberate and habitual sabotage on production 
is carried on. It is felt that here again is a sufficient 
reason why the businesslike management of indus- 
try should! be discontinued; which is the same as 
saying that here again is a visibly sufficient reason 
for such a revolutionary overturn as will close out 
the Old Order of absentee ownership and capitalized 
income. It is also evident that any plan which shall 
contrive to dispense with this deliberate and habit- 
ual unemployment of men and equipment will have 
that much more of a margin to go on, both in re- 
spect of practical efficiency and in respect of popu- 
lar tolerance; and evidently, too, any other than a 
businesslike management of industry can so con- 
trive, as a matter of course; inasmuch as any such 
unbusinesslike administration as, e.g., the Soviet 
will be relieved of the businesslike manager's black- 
est bug-bear, "a reasonably profitable level of 
prices." 

But for all that, those shudderingly sanguine per- 
sons who are looking for a dissolution of the system 
of absentee ownership within two years' time are not 
counting on salesmanlike waste and businesslike sa- 
botage to bring on the collapse, so much as they 
count on the item listed under (d) above the sys- 
tematic dislocation and all-round defeat of produc- 
tive industry which is due in part to shrewd man- 
oeuvres of businesslike strategy, in part to the habit- 
ual ignorance of business men touching the sys- 
tematic requirements of the industrial system as a 
whole. The shrewd worldly wisdom of the business- 
like managers, looking consistently to the main 
chance, works in harmoniously with their trained 
ignorance on matters of technology, to bring about 
what amounts to effectual team-work for the defeat 
of the country's industrial system as a going con- 
cern. Yet doubtless this sinister hope of a collapse 
within two years is too sanguine. Doubtless the 
underlying population can be counted on solidly to 
put up with what they are so well used to, just yet; 
more particularly so long as they are not in the 
habit of thinking about these things at all. Nor 
does it seem reasonable to believe that this all-per- 
vading waste and confusion of industrial forces will 
of itself bring the business organization to a col- 
lapse within so short a time. 

It is true, the industrial system is continually 
growing, in volume and complication; and with 



342 



THE DIAL 



October 18 



every new extension of its scope and range, and with 
every added increment of technological practice that 
goes into effect, there comes a new and urgent op- 
portunity for the business men in control to extend 
and speed up their strategy of mutual obstruction 
and defeat; it is all in the day's work. As the indus- 
trial system grows larger and more closely inter- 
woven it offers continually larger and more enticing 
opportunities for such businesslike manoeuvres as 
will effectually derange the system at the same time 
that they bring the desired tactical defeat on some 
business rival; whereby the successful business 
strategist is enabled to get a little something for 
nothing at a constantly increasing cost to the com- 
njunity at large. With every increment of growth 
and maturity the country's industrial system be- 
comes more delicately balanced, more intricately 
bound in a web of industrial give and take, more 
sensitive to far-reaching derangement by any local 
dislocation, more widely and instantly responsive to 
any failure of the due correlation at any point; and 
by the same move the captains of industry, to whose 
care the interests of absentee ownership are en- 
trusted, are enabled, or rather they are driven by 
the necessities of competitive business, to plan their 
strategy of mutual defeat and derangement on larger 
and more intricate lines, with an ever wider reach 
and a more massive mobilization of forces. From 
which follows an ever increasing insecurity of work 
and output from day to day and an increased as- 
surance of general loss and .disability in the long 
run; incidentally coupled with increased hardship 
for the underlying population, which comes in all 
along as a subsidiary matter of course, unfortunate 
but unavoidable. It is this visibly growing failure 
of the present businesslike management to come up 
to the industrial necessities of the case ; its unfitness 
to take anything like reasonable care of the needed 
correlation of industrial forces within the system; 
its continual working at cross purposes in the allo- 
cation of energy resources, materials, and man 
power it is this fact, that any businesslike manage- 
ment of necessity runs at cross purposes with the 
larger technical realities of the industrial system, 
that chiefly goes to persuade apprehensive persons 
that the regime of business enterprise is fast ap- 
proaching the limit of tolerance. So it is held by 
many that this existing system of absentee owner- 
ship must presently break down and precipitate the 
abdication of the Vested Interests, under conviction 
of total imbecility. 

The theory on which these apprehensive persons 
proceed appears to be substantially sound, so far as 
it goes, but they reach an unguardedly desperate 
conclusion because they overlook one of the main 



facts of the case. There is no reasonable exception 
to be taken to the statement that the country's indus- 
trial system is forever growing more extensive and 
more complex ; that it is continually taking on more 
of the character of a close-knit, interwoven, sys- 
tematic whole; a delicately balanced moving equi- 
librium of working parts, no one of which can do its 
work by itself at all, and none of which can do its 
share of the work well except in close correlation 
with all the rest. At the same time it is also true 
that, in the commercialized nature of things, the 
businesslike management of industry is forever 
playing fast and loose with this delicately balanced 
moving equilibrium of forces, on which the liveli- 
hood of the underlying population depends from 
day to day; more particularly is this true for that 
large-scale business enterprise that rests on absentee 
ownership and makes up the country's greater 
Vested Interests. But to all this it is to be added, 
as a corrective and a main factor in the case, that 
this system of mechanical industry is an extremely 
efficient contrivance for the production of goods and 
services, even when, as usual, the business men, for 
business reasons, will allow it to work only under a 
large handicap of unemployment and obstructive 
tactics. Hitherto the margin for error, that is to say 
for wasteful strategy and obstructive ignorance, has 
been very wide; so wide that it has saved the life 
of the Vested Interests ; and it is accordingly by no 
means confidently to be believed that all these amp- 
ler opportunities for swift and wide-reaching de- 
rangement will enable the strategy of business enter- 
prise to bring on a disastrous collapse, just yet. 

It is true, if the country's productive industry 
were competently organized as a systematic whole, 
and were then managed by competent technicians 
with an eye single to maximum production of goods 
and services ; instead of, as now, being manhandled 
by ignorant business men with an eye single to 
maximum profits ; the resulting output of goods and 
services would doubtless exceed the current output 
by several hundred per cent. But then, none of all 
that is necessary to save the established order of 
things. All that is required is a decent modicum of 
efficiency, very far short of the theoretical maximum 
production. In effect, the community is in the habit 
of getting along contentedly on something appreci- 
ably less than one-half the output which its indus- 
trial equipment would turn out if it were working 
uninterruptedly at full capacity; even when, as us- 
ual, something like one-half of the actual output is 
consumed in wasteful superfluities. The margin for 
waste and error is very wide, fortunately; and, in 
effect, a more patient and more inclusive survey of 
the facts in the case would suffice to show that the 



1919 



THE DIAL 



343 



tenure of the Vested Interests is reasonably secure 
just yet; at least in so far as it turns on considera- 
tions of this nature. 

There is, of course, the chance, and it is by no 
means a remote chance, that the rapidly increasing 
volume and complexity of the industrial system may 
presently bring the country's industry into such a 
ticklish state of unstable equilibrium that even a 
reasonable modicum of willful derangement can no 
longer be tolerated, even for the most urgent and 
most legitimate reasons of business) ike strategy and 
vested rights. In time, such an outcome is presum- 
ably due to be looked for. There is, indeed, no lack 
of evidence that the advanced industrial countries 
are approaching such a state of things, America 
among the rest. The margin for error and wasteful 
strategy is, in effect, being continually narrowed by 
the further advance of the industrial arts. ' With 
every further advance in the way of specialization 
and standardization, in point of kind, quantity, qual- 
ity, and time, the tolerance of the system as a whole 
under any strategic maladjustment grows continu- 
ally narrower. 

How soon the limit of tolerance for willful de- 
rangement is due to be reached, would be a hazard- 
ous topic of speculation. There is now a fair 
prospect that the coming winter may throw some 
light on that dark question; but this is not saying 
that the end is in sight. What is here insisted on is 
that that sinister eventuality lies yet in the future, 
although it may be in the calculable future, So also 
it is well to keep in mind that even a fairly disas- 
trous collapse of the existing system of businesslike 
management need by no means prove fatal to the 
Vested Interests, just yet; not so long as there is no 
competent organization ready to take their place 
and administer the country's industry on a more rea- 
sonable plan. It is necessarily a question of al- 
ternatives. 

In all this argument that runs on perennial dis- 
location and cross purposes, it is assumed that the 
existing businesslike management of industry is of 
a competitive nature, and necessarily moves on lines 
of competitive strategy. As a subsidiary premise it 
is, of course, also assumed that the captains of in- 
dustry who have the direction of this competitive 
strategy are ordinarily sufficiently ill informed on 
technological matters to go wrong, industrially 
speaking, even with the most pacific and benevolent 
intentions. They are laymen in all that concerns 
the technical demands of industrial production. 
This latter, and minor, assumption therefore need 
not be argued; it is sufficiently notorious. On the 
other hand, the first assumption spoken of above, 
that current business enterprise is of a competitive 



nature, is likely to be questioned by many who be- 
lieve themselves to be familiar with the facts in the 
case. It is argued, by one and another, that the 
country's business concerns have entered into con- 
solidations, coalitions, understandings and working 
arrangements among themselves syndicates, trusts, 
pools, combinations, interlocking directorates, gen- 
tlemen's agreements, employers' unions to such an 
extent as virtually to cover the field of that large- 
scale business that sets the pace and governs the 
movements of the rest; and that where combination 
takes effect in this way, competition ceases. So also 
it will be argued that where there has been no form- 
al coalition of interests the business men in charge 
will still commonly act in collusion, with much the 
same result. The suggestion is also ready to hand 
that in so far as business like sabotage of this com- 
petitive order is still to be met with, it can all be 
corrected by such a further consolidation of inter- 
ests as will do away with all occasion for competi- 
tive cross purposes within the industrial system. 

It is not easy to see just how far that line of argu- 
ment would lead; but to make it effective and to 
cover the case it would plainly have to result in so 
wide a coalition of interests and pooling of man- 
agement as would, in effect, eliminate all occasion 
for businesslike management within the system, and 
leave the underlying population quite unreservedly 
at the disposal of the resulting coalition of interests 
an outcome which is presumably not contem- 
plated. And even so, the argument takes account of 
only one strand in that three-ply rope that goes to 
fashion the fatal noose. The remaining two are 
stout enough, and they have not been touched. It is 
true, economists and others who have canvassed this 
matter of competition have commonly given their 
attention to this one line of competition alone 
between rival commercial interests because this 
competition is conceived to be natural and normal 
and to serve the common good. But there remains 
(a) the competition between those business men 
who buy cheap and sell dear and the underlying 
population from and to whom they buy cheap and 
sell dear, and (b) the competition between the cap- 
tains of industry and those absentee owners in 
whose name and with whose funds the captains do 
business. In the typical case, modern business en- 
terprise takes the corporate form, is organized on 
credit, and therefore rests on absentee ownership; 
from which it follows that in all large-scale busi- 
ness the owners are not the same persons as the 
managers, nor does the interest of the manager com- 
monly coincide with that of his absentee owners, 
particularly in the modern "big business." 

So it follows that even a coalition of Vested 



344 



THE DIAL 



October 18 



Interests which should be virtually all-inclusive, 
would still have to make up its account with "what 
the traffic will bear," that is to say what will bring 
the largest net income in terms of price; that is to 
say, the coalition would still be under the competi- 
tive necessity of buying cheap and selling dear, to 
the best of its ability and with the use of all the 
facilities which its dominant position in the market 
would give. The coalition, therefore, would still be 
under the necessity of shrewdly limiting the output 
of goods and services to such a rate and volume as 
will maintain or advance prices; and also to vary 
its manipulation of prices and supply from place 
to place and from time to time, to turn an honest 
penny; which leaves the case very near the point 
of beginning. But then, such a remedy for these 
infelicities of the competitive system will probably 
be admitted to be chimerical, without argument. 

But what is more to the point is the fact, known 
even when it is not avowed, that the consolidations 
which have been effected hitherto have not elim- 
inated competition, nor have they changed the char- 
acter of the competitive strategy employed, al- 
though they have altered its scale and methods. 
What can be said is that the underlying corpora- 
tions of the holding companies, e.g., are no longer 
competitors among themselves on the ancient foot- 
ing. But strategic dislocation and cross purposes 
continue to be the order of the day in the business- 
like management of industry; and the volume of 
habitual unemployment, whether of equipment or 
of man power, continues undiminished and m> 
ashamed which is after all a major count in the 



case. 



It is well to recognize what the business men 
among themselves always recognize as a matter of 
course, that business is in the last analysis always 
carried on for the private advantage of the individ- 
ual business men who carry it on. And these enter- 
prising persons, being business men, will always be 
competitors for gain among themselves, however 
much and well they may combine for a common 
purpose as against the rest of the community. The 
end and aim of any gainful enterprise carried 
through in common is always the division of the 
joint gains, and in this division the joint partici- 
pants always figure, as competitors. The syndi- 
cates, coalitions, corporations, consolidations of in- 
terests, so entered into in the pursuit of gain are, 
in effect, in the nature of conspiracies between busi- 
ness men each seeking his own advantage at the 
cost of any whom it may concern. There is no 
ulterior solidarity of interests among the partici- 
pants in such a joint enterprise. 

By way of illustration, what is set forth in the 



voluminous testimony taken in the Colton case, be- 
fore the California courts, having to do with the 
affairs of the Southern Pacific and its subsidiaries, 
will show in what fashion the businesslike incen- 
tives of associated individuals may be expected to 
work out in the partition of benefits within a given 
coalition. And not only is there no abiding solidar- 
ity of interests between the several participants in 
such a joint enterprise, so far as regards the final 
division of the spoils, but it is also true that the 
business interest of the manager in charge of such a 
syndicate of absentee ownership will not coincide 
with the collective interest of the coalition as a 
going concern. As an illustrative instance may be 
cited the testimony of the great president of the 
two Great Northern railways, taken before a Con- 
gressional commission, wherein it is explained 
somewhat fully that for something like a quarter- 
century the two great roads under his management 
had never come in for reasonable earnings on their 
invested capital. And it is a matter of common 
notoriety, although it was charitably not brought 
out in the hearings of the commission, that during 
his incumbency as manager of the two great rail- 
way systems this enterprising railway president had 
by thrift and management increased his own pri- 
vate possessions from $20 to something variously 
estimated at $150,000,000 to $200,000,000; while 
his two chief associates in this adventure had re- 
tired from the management on a similarly comfort- 
able footing; so notably comfortable, indeed, as to 
have merited a couple of very decent peerages un- 
der the British crown. 

In effect, there still is an open call for shrewd 
personal strategy at the cost of any whom it may 
concern; all the while that there is also a very 
appreciable measure of collision among the Vested 
Interests, at the cost of any whom it may concern. 
Business is still competitive business, competitive 
pursuit of private gain; as how should it not be? 
seeing that the incentive to all business is after all 
private gain at the cost of any whom it may con- 
cern. 

By reason of doctrinal consistency and loyalty 
to tradition, the certified economists have habitu- 
ally described business enterprise as a rational ar- 
rangement for administering the country's indus- 
trial system and assuring a full and equitable dis- 
tribution of consumable goods to the consumers. 
There need be no quarrel with that view. But it is 
only fair to enter the reservation that, considered 
as an arrangement for administering the country's 
industrial system, business enterprise based on ab- 
sentee ownership has the defects of its qualities; 
and these defects of this good old plan are now

calling attention to themselves. Hitherto, and ever 
since the mechanical industry first came into the 
dominant place in this industrial system, the de- 
fects of this businesslike management of industry 
have continually been encroaching more and more 
on its qualities. It took its rise as a system of man- 
agement by the owners of the industrial equipment, 
and it has in its riper years grown into a system of 
absentee ownership managed by quasi-responsible 
financial agents. Having begun as an industrial 
community which centered about an open market, 
it has matured into a community of Vested Interests 
whose vested right it is to keep up prices by a 
short supply in a closed market. There is no ex- 
travagance in saying that, by and large, this ar- 
rangement for controlling the production and dis- 
tribution of goods and services through the agency 
of absentee ownership has now come to be, in the 
main, a blundering muddle of defects. For the 
purpose in hand, that is to say with a view to the 
probable chance of any revolutionary overturn, this 
may serve as a fair characterization of the regime 
of the Vested Interests; whose continued rule is 
now believed by their Guardians to be threatened 
by a popular uprising in the nature of Bolshevism. 
Now, as to the country's industrial system which 
is manhandled on this businesslike plan; it is a 
comprehensive and balanced scheme of technolog- 
ical administration. Industry of this modern sort 
mechanical, specialized, standardized, running to 
quantity production, drawn on a large scale is 
highly productive; provided always that the neces- 
sary conditions of its working are met in some 
passable fashion. These necessary conditions of 
productive industry are of a well-defined technical 
character, and they are growing more and more ex- 
acting with every farther advance in the industrial 
arts. This mechanical industry draws always more 
and more largely and urgently on the natural 
sources of mechanical power, and it necessarily 
makes use of an ever increasingly wide and varied 
range of materials, drawn from all latitudes and 
all geographical regions, in spite of obstructive 
national frontiers and patriotic animosities; for the 
mechanical technology is impersonal and dispas- 
sionate, and its end is very simply to serve human 
needs, without fear or favor or respect of persons, 
prerogatives, or politics. It makes up an indus- 
trial system of an unexampled character a me- 
chanically balanced and interlocking system of 
work to be done, the prime requisite of whose work- 
ing is a painstaking and intelligent co-ordination 
of the processes at work, and an equally painstak- 
ing allocation of mechanical power and materials. 
The foundation and driving force of it all is a 



massive body by technological knowledge, of a 
highly impersonal and altogether unbusinesslike 
nature, running in close contact with the material 
exactingly specialized, endlessly detailed, reaching 
out into all domains of empirical fact. 

Such is the system of productive work which has 
grown out of the Industrial Revolution, and on the 
full and free run of which the material welfare of 
all the civilized peoples now depends from day to 
day. Any defect or hindrance in its technical ad- 
ministration, any intrusion of non-technical consi- 
derations, any failure or obstruction at any point, 
unavoidably results in a disproportionate set-back 
to the balanced whole and brings a disproportion- 
ate burden of privation on all these peoples whose 
sciences, on which it draws freely at every turn 
as a going concern. There is no third party quali- 
fied lo make a colorable bid, or able to make good 
the system. 

It follows that those gifted, trained, and exper- 
ienced technicians who now are in possession of 
the requisite technological information and exper- 
ience are the first and instantly indispensable fac- 
tor in the everyday work of carrying on the coun- 
try's productive industry. They now constitute the 
General Staff of the industrial system, dn fact; 
whatever law and custom may formally say in pro- 
test. The "captains of industry" may still vain- 
gloriously claim that distinction, and law and cus- 
tom still countenances their claim ; but the captains 
have no technological value, in fact. 

Therefore any question of a revolutionary over- 
turn, in America or in any other of the advanced 
industrial countries, resolves itself in practical fact 
into a question of what the guild of technicians 
will do. In effect it is a question whether the dis- 
cretion and responsibility in the management of 
technicians, who speak for the industrial system 
productive industry has come within the sweep of 
the country's industry shall pass from the finan- 
ciers, who speak for the Vested Interests, to the 
its pretensions if it should make a bid. So long as 
the vested rights of absentee ownership remain in- 
tact, the financial powers that is to say the Vested 
Interests will continue to dispose of the country's 
industrial forces for their own profit; and so soon, 
or so far, as these vested rights give way, the con- 
trol of the people's material welfare will pass into 
the hands of the technicians. There is no third 
party. 

The chances of anything like a Soviet in Amer- 
ica, therefore, are the chances of a Soviet of tech- 
nicians. And, to the due comfort of the Guardians 
of the Vested Interests and the good citizens who 
make up their background, it can be shown that 



346

anything like a Soviet of Technicians is at the most 
a remote contingency in America. It is true, so 
long as no such change of base is ma*de, what is 
confidently to be looked for is a regime of contin- 
ued and increasing shame and confusion, hardship 
and dissension, unemployment and privation, waste 
and insecurity of person and property such as the 
rule of the Vested Interests in business has already 
made increasingly familiar to all the civilized peo- 
ples. But the vested rights of absentee ownership 
are still embedded in the sentiments of the under- 
lying population, and still continue to be the Pal- 
ladium of the Republic; and the assertion is still 
quite safe that anything like a Soviet of Technicians 
is not a present menace to the Vested Interests in 
America. 

By settled habit the technicians, the engineers and 
industrial experts, are a harmless and docile sort, 
well fed on the whole, and somewhat placidly con- 
tent with the "full dinner-pail" which the lieu- 
tenants of the Vested Interests habitually allow 
them. It is true, they constitute the indispensable 
General Staff of that industrial system which feeds 
the Vested Interests; but, hitherto at least, they 
have had nothing- to say in the planning and direc- 
tion of this industrial system, except as employees 
in the pay of the financiers. They have, hitherto 
been quite unreflectingly content to work piece- 
meal, without much of an understanding among 
themselves, * unreservedly doing job-work for the 
Vested Interests; and they have without much re- 
flection lent themselves and their technical powers 
freely to the obstructive tactics of the captains of 
industry; all the while that the training which 
makes them technicians is but a specialized exten- 
sion of that joint stock of technological knowledge 
that has been carried forward out of the past by 
the community at large. 

But it remains true that they and their dear- 
bought knowledge of ways and means dear- 
bought on the part of the underlying community 
are the pillars of that house of industry in which 
the Vested Interests continue to live. Without their 
continued and unremitting supervision and direc- 
tion the industrial system would cease to be a 



working system at all; whereas it is not easy to 
see how the elimination of the existing business- 
like control could bring anything but relief and 
heightened efficiency to this working system. The 
technicians are indispensable to productive indus- 
try of this mechanical sort; the Vested Interests 
and their absentee owners are not. The technicians 
are indispensable to the Vested Interests and their 
absentee owners, as -a working force without which 
there would be no industrial output to control or 
divide; whereas the Vested Interests and their ab- 
sentee owners are of no material consequence to 
the technicians and their work, except as an ex- 
traneous interference and obstruction. 

It follows that the material welfare of all the 
advanced industrial peoples rests in the hands of 
these technicians, if they will only see it that way, 
take counsel together, constitute themselves the 
self -directing General Staff of the country's indus- 
try, and dispense with the interference of the lieu- 
tenants of the absentee owners. Already they are 
strategically in a position to take the lead and im- 
pose their own terms of leadership, so soon as they, 
or a decisive number of them, shall reach a com- 
mon understanding to that effect and agree on a 
plan of action. 

But there is assuredly no present promise of the 
technicians' turning their insight and common 
sense to such a use. There need be no present ap- 
prehension. The technicians are a "safe and sane" 
lot, on the whole; and they are pretty well com- 
mercialized, particularly the older generation, who 
speak with authority and conviction, and to whom 
the younger generation of engineers defer, on the 
whole, with such a degree of filial piety as should 
go far to reassure all good citizens. And herein 
lies the present security of the Vested Interests, as 
well as the fatuity of any present alarm about Bol- 
shevism and the like; for the whole-hearted co- 
operation of the technicians would be as indispens- 
able to any effectual movement of overturn as their 
unwavering service in the employ of the Vested 
Interests in indispensable to the maintenance of the 
established order.

A FORTNIGHTLY 



The Old Order and the New 



o WHAT EXTENT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AN EN- 

vironment and to what extent Marxian working 
class psychology determines a labor policy is 
well illustrated in the recent activ.ty of the or- 
ganized railroad workers of England and the 
United States. In both cases the railroad men 
are approximately one hundred per cent organized. 
In England exists a well-developed working class 
opinion which has become aggressive since the 
war and which in contrast to the United States 
is intensive, extensive, and conscious. On ac- 
count of this opinion it was possible for the rail- 
road workers to effect a complete tieup. And it 
was because the opinion was so well developed 
that the state capitulated. The government played 
its part in two short acts; the first was a heroic 
pretense of resistance, the second a boisterous 
surrender in the person of the British premier. 
The Brotherhoods will not call a national strike 
in the United States because they know that 
there is no organized opinion which would sup- 
port them. Opinion in the United States is 
basically middle class. When the socialists of 
the country admit that fact they will know 
that the plan of the Railroad Brotherhoods for 
the administration of the roads is as revolutionary 
or more so in its significance as a national strike 
in any or all industries. The fact that the Amer- 
ican working man has persistently considered him- 
self as good as anyone else, as belonging to no 
class, is partly accountable for the emergence of 
a revolutionary program under the auspices of 
the most middle class labor group. This pro- 
gram of the railroad workers is acceptable to 
middle class American workingmen because it is 
a recognition that the workers are as good as 
anybody else, are fit for status and responsibility. 
Instead of lining up with wage slaves in a strike 
for wages they line up under the Brotherhood 
propos-tion with industrial management. By a 
different road the British workers have been 
more or less consciously approaching this posi- 
tion. For many years the guild socialists of 
England have been urging the new union plan ; 
in the past months it has made remarkable gains 
and the principle back of the plan is understood 
there as it is not yet understood among the mass 
of workers here. The year of grace which the 
government granted the British railroad men may 
be all the t me British labor will need to trans- 
form the theory of labor control of industry 
into a policy of organization. It looks as though 



a year of. agitation of the Plumb Plan League 
might also convert the organized workers of this 
country. The common result in both countries 
is precipitated by industrial necessity. The guild 
socialists had the keeness to forecast the necessity 
and have done more than any other group in 
England to prepare the workers for a policy of 
industrial control. The syndicalists and the In- 
dustrial Workers of the World had also before 
the war aroused a certain recognition the world 
over of the principle of labor control. It was the 
war, however, in discrediting bureaucratic manage- 
ment that was the greater clarifier of industrial 
issues and is now pressing on the conservative labor 
forces a new vision and revolutionary drive. 



JVOLCHAK, THEY SAY, HAS NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED. 

Lenin, too, remains outside the pale. The ship- 
ment of food to Soviet Russia would involve us 
in something like a recognition of the Bolshevist 
Government, and must therefore be prohibited. 
The shipment of munitions to Kolchak proceeds, 
however with what diplomatic implications the 
State Department may best testify. Recognition 
or no recognition what does it matter? Shortly 
before Ambassador Morris' visit to Omsk, Paul 
S. Reinsch, United States Minister to China, 
transmitted to Washington certain American con- 
sular reports which pronounced Kolchak a reac- 
tionary and stated that he was much distrusted 
by the Siberian population. With some show of 
uncertainty the press reported that Ambassador 
Morris' preliminary reports in a general way 
substantiated those transmitted by Reinsch, and 
were unfavorable to the recognition of the Si- 
berian dictator. About this time the Allied diplo- 
mats at Omsk were addressed to the following ef- 
fect by Kolchak: 

In an hour of trial the Admiral took upon himself the 
burden of supreme power. He did this with the approval 
and advice of the Allies, who promised unlimited support 
in the struggle against the Bolshevist Government. Un- 
fortunately, the period which has elapsed since then has 
demonstrated the assistance furnished by the Allies to have 
been inadequate, to say the least, compared with the scale 
required for the success of the struggle . r . If this 
lingering and hesitating attitude toward the Government 
and its activity should continue, the Supreme Ruler will 
hold that he has no right to bear the heavy responsibility 
for the outcome and consequences of the struggle which is 
to decide the fate of Russia, . . . 

The effect of these words was marvelous, if we 



348 



THE DIAL 



October 18 



are to believe the journal already quoted, for: 

The representatives of the United States and Japan, after 
communicating with their Governments, deemed the decla- 
rations of the Supreme Ruler to be quite right and meriting 
full satisfaction. . . . The Allied powers expressed 
their readiness immediately to increase the volume of all 
necessary supplies for the army and for the rear to the ex- 
tent indicated in the Government plan. . . . 

Accurate or not, the story is interesting. Cer- 
tainly Ambassador Morris reversed his ^original 
position and recommended recognition and eco- 
nomic aid for Kolchak. Certainly, too, the "ne- 
cessary supplies" have been dispatched regularly 
from Pacific ports to the reactionary forces that 
have become our special charge. It has remained 
for the direct actionists of the Pacific coast to make 
the first effective effort to stop the murderous busi- 
ness that has reduced our liberals to wet-eyed im- 
potence. Two methods of breaking the blockade 
suggest themselves. The United States Government 
may buy the war material, handle it with military 
labor, and float it in army transports; so far as is 
known, this proceedure has not yet been attempted. 
Or the munitions trade may be left in private 
hands, and military labor and military bottoms 
may fee used to move the goods. Secretary Baker 
certainly recognizes the possibilities of this type 
of indirect action, for it is reported that he has 
recommended that a bill be introduced into Con- 
gress authorizing the War Department to carry 
commercial cargoes on army transports. But even 
if the bill is passed it is possible that shipments 
of munitions may be tied up by a refusal of the 
railroad workers to move the material from the 
factories to the ports. And the Administration 
will hardly dare to propose the militarization of 
the railways, even in Kolchak's cause. 

IT IS NO PECULIARITY of the steel strike that it 
lends itself to description in terms of the battle- 
field. What is alarming in the present situation 
is the tendency of the government to single out 
the strikers as the enemy. That tendency unfor- 
tunately gives support to all the syndicalist doc- 
trines which Mr. W. Z. Foster affected to repu- 
diate before the Senate Committee. It is not 
enough that milltown officials should preserve the 
kind of law and order favorable to the steel cor- 
porations' view of the strike, by prohibiting pub- 
lic meetings and recklessly breaking into private 
ones, and thus creating a spurious identity be- 
tween public and private interests. Nor is it 
enough that the Pennsylvania State Constabulary 
should deliberately provoke bloodshed on the 
strictly Prussic ground that peaceable public con- 
sultations are given inherently to disorder. In 
order to prove conclusively to the strikers the 
impartiality of the Federal Government and the 
lofty neutrality of the state, the Department of 
Justice arrived on the scene at an early stage 
and put into operation the machinery whereby 



the commonplaces of sociology and politics, in 
the mouth of a foreign leader, become punishable 
as sedition and incitement to riot. On top of 
the gratutitous Federal activity in the steel 
centers, came the announcement from Washing- 
ton of a new policy of employing the military 
arm: a War Department order that places the com- 
mandants of Federal army districts at the immedi- 
ate call of state governors, without having the re- 
quest countersigned at Washington. In connection 
with race rioting such a move would seem sufficient- 
ly innocent, although this new association of mili- 
tary and civil authority in a strictly local situattion 
is sufficiently a departure from the American tradi- 
tion to tempt the historian to inquire whether every 
Waterloo brings a Peterloo inevitably in its wake. 
But the use of the Federal troops in the Gary dis- 
trict under the same terms that permitted their em- 
ployment in Omaha is an invidious reflection 
against the working population. As indicative of 
the animus of the Federal Government this would 
be a grave enough indictment of the new method 
of dealing with "disorder." But this is not all. 
The direct action of Federal troops divorces the 
power of the Federal Government from the re- 
sponsibility of exercising that power prudently: 
the reckless institution of martial law and military 
infringements of constitutional guarantees now 
rest solely in the discretion of local authorities 
whose infirmity in keeping within constitutional 
bounds is already notorious. Is there anything 
to differentiate democratic twentieth century 
America's way of dealing with industrial disputes 
fiom that of oligarchic nineteenth century Eng- 
land? Is Wood an improvement on Wellington? 
Is public authority in America disinterested and 
enlightened and humane and above all neutral? 
The worker who began the strike as a disciple of 
Herbert Spencer in the belief that the state was 
merely a nuisance might well, in the light of 
these provocations, come out of it as a follower 
of Sorel in the conviction that the state was an 
active enemy. This is the deplorable upshot of 
the steel strike. In comparison with it the in- 
dustrial results' are insignificant.

THE BELGIAN-DUTCH QUARREL 

SIR: The publication of the fake dispatch 
about a Belgian-Dutch rupture has given occasion 
for all sorts of untrue and insulting comment on 
the part Holland has played during the war and 
since the armistice and especially in the course 
of her present negotiations with Belgium. As a 
matter of fact, I find upon my return in this coun- 
try that no European neutral had received such 
shabby and unfair treatment in the American press 
as Holland. Every morning, one can find one or 
two in just "digs" at the Hague Government, 
coupled with silly charges that the Dutch people 
are "pro-German" and as some witty writer put 
it the other day "in the pay of Potsdam." It is 
difficult to discover why such indignities should 
have been piled on the Dutch, while the other 
neutrals of Europe, some of whom maintained 
a most questionable attitude throughout the war, 
are being treated with every kid-gloved courtesy. 

The present negotiations which are being con- 
ducted under the watchful regard of the Big (are 
they really so big?) Five (are there really five?) 
with the object of reshuffling the treaties of 1839 
can be considered as a case in point. Little is 
known outside Belgium and Holland of these 
treaties of 1839, little is known in America re- 
garding the Belgian claims and the Dutch attitude, 
rnd yet everybody considers that Belgium must be 
in the right, and Holland in the wrong, without 
further ado. The matter, roughly, is one in which 
both parties could reach a satisfactory solution, 
were it not for the activities of a clique of im- 
perialists, active both in Holland and Belgium, 
who cannot be content, so they say, with arbitra- 
tion and insist on wanting "the whole hog, or 
none." 

What does Belgium want of Holland? Simply 
the control over the mouth of the Scheldt, and a 
frontier rectification along the Meuse. I pur- 
posely say "Belgium" and not the Belgian ex- 
tremists, who hope not only that Belgium will 
rule the waves of both rivers, but that she will an- 
nex vast portions of Holland, where staunch and 
patriotic Hollanders live in the hope of dying as 
Hollanders too. It is quite true and nobody even 
in Holland denies it that the treaties of 1839 
should be remodelled, especially as they were 
based on the understanding that Belgium should re- 
main "perpetually neutral." The neutrality of Bel- 
gium is dead. Therefore the treaties which found 
their origin and their raison d'etre in this neutrality 
must perforce be adapted to the present novel con- 
ditions. Under the former treaties, Holland was 
granted a sort of right of police over the lower 
Scheldt; the Belgians now claim that Antwerp, 
their only large harbor, was thereby placed under 
a serious physical disadvantage. But is this quite 



true? Had not Antwerp, even under that "seri- 
ous physical disadvantage," become before the 
war one of the most important harbors of Europe? 
Had it not forestalled Rotterdam and Bremen 
and Marseilles? How could that have been pos- 
sible if the Dutch had really misused their rights 
over the lower Scheldt with a selfish view of 
harming Antwerp to help Rotterdam, their new 
leading harbor? I lived many years in Belgium 
before the war and never heard any com- 
plaint regarding the manner in which the Dutch 
exercised their sovereignty over the mouth of the 
Scheldt. These complaints became loud only 
after the armistice. Why? Simply because it 
would be easy to persuade the Big Five to au- 
thorize the annexation by Belgium of the portion 
of Zeelandish Flanders comprised between the 
Belgian-Dutch frontier and the lower Scheldt if 
a case could be made out against the Dutch for 
misusing their privileges over the mouth of that 
great river and if it could be proven that Belgium 
had suffered greatly at the hands of a greedy, self- 
ish, and inconsiderate neighor. 

Of course one of these charges against Holland 
is a by-product of the war itself. Belgium ac- 
cuses Holland of having kept the Scheldt closed 
ever since the war began, thereby making it im- 
possible for the Allies to relieve Antwerp. It is 
quite true that Holland did that, and truer still 
that she had to do it, and that this attitude was 
incumbent upon her as a consequence of her neu- 
trality. Had Holland's closing of the Scheldt 
been contrary to the stipulations of existing treat- 
ies or to international law nobody doubts that 
the Allies would have found some means of forc- 
ing her into another attitude. Holland, in acting 
as she did, simply did her duty as a neutral 
power. And the fulfilment of that duty, curiously 
enough, may have handicaped the Belgians during 
the siege of Antwerp (though every military ex- 
pert will tell you that it would have been impos- 
sible for the British fleet steaming up to Ant- 
werp to prevent the capture of the city), but it 
handicaped the Germans to a far greater degree, 
for with the Scheldt closed by neutral Holland, 
Antwerp could not be made a submarine base. 

With regard to the Meuse, the situation is dif- 
ferent. The configuration of the Belgian-Dutch 
frontier through Limburg is ill-adapted to Bel- 
gium's military defence. But the Meuse area in 
dispute includes the city of Maastricht, which is 
Dutch and wants to remain Dutch, and it also 
includes Holland's only coal mines, without which 
Holland cannot maintain an independent indus- 
trial existence. It is very kind of the Belgians 
to offer Holland in exchange of the Maastricht 
enclave a slice of Germany, which Holland does

Dutch Limburg by Belgium on the plea of com- 
mercial and military necessity would be an act of 
gross injustice and of unquestioned political im- 
morality. Therefore, Holland has opposed a 
absolute non possumus to any proposal for the 
annexation of Dutch territory, with or without 
"compensations." 

Holland is only too anxious to "speak" with 
Belgium in a cordial and open way, and there 
should be many responsible statesmen in Belgium 
who share Holland's moderate and fair views. But 
it seems that for some time moderation, which 
used to be a Belgian quality, had been undiscov- 
erable in Brussels, as a consequence of Belgium's 
share in a glorious victory. This is not sur- 
prising, but it is regrettable. If moderation can 
not induce some of the Belgian annexationists to 
discuss the whole problem with the Dutch, the 
rememberance of the exceptional kindness and 
generosity shown to the Belgians who took refuge 
in Holland during the war should certainly help 
in that direction. Holland in that respect certainly 
did wonders, in spite of the great and painful 
hardships she herself suffered through the double 
blockade by England and Germany. In spite of 
that precarious position "between the hammer and 
the anvil," Holland oudid all other neutrals in 
helpfulness and warm-hearted generosity. It is 
now up to the Belgians to deal with Holland with 
the greatest fairness, to discuss with her the grave 
European problems that confront both nations in 
a spirit of wisdom, moderation, and honesty, if 
not actually of thankfulness. Holland is ready for 
that discussion, on condition that Belgium does 
not demand her to cut her throat to please her 
neighbors. Belgium has fought magnificently for 
the highest principles that rule international rela- 
tionship between civilized peoples. It is up to 
her to live up to these principles, among which 
self-determination is the first and foremost, and to 
find (with the help and even, if need be, with 
the cordial pressure of the great powers) a solu- 
tion by which Belgium and Holland can live at 
peace without the rights of one Dutch citizen hav- 
ing been violated, and without one frontier mile- 
stone having been removed.

AFTER Us THE DELUGE 

SIR: Can you not forget the Peace Treaty, 
Wilson, and other inconsequential matters for a 
day and give a little attention to the more im- 
portant matter of the weather. We had forty-three 
rainy days last month and more than thirty Mar- 
blehead washerwomen committed suicide. If this 
thing keeps on every woman will have to do her 
own wash ng and the whole order of creation will 
thereby be set at naught.

Notes on New Books 

DEADHAM HARD. By Lucas Malet. 503 pages. 
Dodd, Mead. 

In this novel, mid-Victorian not only in period 
but in characters and in handling of materials, the 
reader follows Damaris Verity through three years 
of her life. The milestones in her development 
from an over imaginative child of eighteen to a 
disillusioned woman of twenty-one are dwelt on 
in detail and at length. The author educates Da- 
maris by introducing her abruptly to her father's 
Byronic past in the shape of a half-brother, whom 
she learns to love dearly; by bringing into her life, 
for a social mentor, an old flame of her father's; 
by the death of her father and finally by a love 
affair with his old friend. Out of all this Damaris 
emerges, still a mid-Victorian heroine and one not 
likely to interest and convince readers much beyond 
her own age. She has too little of the brave quality 
demanded by the public of today. Indeed, in many 
respects, there seems little difference between the 
Damaris of eighteen who faints and develops a 
high fever when Darcy Faircloth announces that he 
is her brother and the Damaris of twenty-one who 
gives way to fits of jealousy and anger and who 
cannot face death. When her dying father sends 
for her and says, "My affairs are in order," Damaris 
shrinks piteously and expostulates, "Oh! But must 
we, are we obliged to speak of those things? They 
grate on me they are ugly. They hurt." 
Sir Richard Calmady there seems to be a straining 
after unpleasant incident. In this connection, as 
in many others, the author states her own philo- 
sophy : 

Most of us are so constituted that at a certain pass, 
pleasure of a sort is to be derived from witnessing the 
anguish of a fellow creature. 

And when Damaris lies overcome by grief, the lines 
of her gracious body outlined by the embroidered 
linen quilt, her father, contemplating her grief, 
"found indeed a strangely vital, if somewhat cruel 
satisfaction in looking on at it." 

The construction, too, has a tendency to lead 
down blind alleys. Tom Verity, who enters the 
second chapter with all the attendant circumstance 
of a hero, holds the scene for fifty pages and then 
drops out. Once thereafter a letter from him causes 
Damaris to blush, and he is among those present 
at a funeral in the last chapter, but that is all. 
Darcy Faircloth, the brother, sails away to Japan. 
Still there are vivid touches, the ghostly atmosphere 
of the old house is well produced and a genuine 
feeling for nature runs through the book. Much 
care has gone to the portrayal of character, so that 
the men and women run true to Victorian type and 
form in their humorless blending of shocked pro- 
priety with an easy acceptance of the sowing and 
reaping of the wild-oat crop.

THE OLD MADHOUSE. By William De Morgan. 
565 pages. Holt. 

This is the last addition which the confirmed De 
Morganite can ever make to the row of fat blue- 
and-gold volumes on his shelves. This fact alone 
would secure respectful treatment* for The Old 
Madhouse, even if it were inferior to its predeces- 
sors. But it isn't. Except for the first flow of his 
genius in Joseph Vance, De Morgan never did bet- 
ter work than this. It reveals no new characteristics, 
but the old ones are present in undiminished force. 
It adds, in the person of Nancy Fraser, one more 
to that group of young women second in English 
literature only to Jane Austen's who are neither 
brilliant prodigies like Meredith's, nor convention- 
ignoring goddesses like Hewlett's, but ordinary, lov- 
able human girls. Mrs. Carteret must rank with 
Mrs. Nightingale as her author's most sympathetic 
portrayal of a middle-aged mother; Lucy Snaith is 
another Delilah like Judith Arkroyd, drawn with 
remorseless insight. 

The story, not quite complete when its author 
died, was finished from his notes by Mrs. De Mor- 
gan. Her postscript on her husband's method of 
composition is worth noting: 

When my husband started on one of his novels, he did 
so without making any definite plot. He created his char- 
acters and then waited for them to act and evolve their 
own plot. In this way the puppets in the show became real 
living personalities to him, and he waited, as he expressed 
it, " to see what they would do next." 

This suggests a doubt. Is there not a possibility 
that some contemporary novelists, with their em- 
phasis on structure, are going wrong are tending 
to produce something analogous to the "well-built" 
plays of Eugene Scribe? The Old Madhouse, as a 
a matter of fact, has a more closely knit plot than 
most of De Morgan's novels, but no one is going 
to remember it, any more than one remembers the 
plot if there is any of Vanity Fair. But when 
we contrast the extraordinary vitality of the people 
created by De Dorgan and the great Victorians with 
the carefully-painted puppets who so neatly per- 
form the actions required of them by the plot of 
the well-built modern novel, we cannot escape at 
least a momentary suspicion that De Morgan, in 
placing character first, has chosen the better part. 

A CHILDHOOD IN BRITTANY EIGHTY YEARS AGO. 
By* Anne Douglas Sedwick. 224 pages. Cen- 
tury. 

In this "little sheaf of childish memories" the 
author has set down the recollections of an old 
French friend. There is none of the subtlety of 
Tante or The Encounter here; only a charming 
simplicity with the exquisite clearness of a silhou- 
ette. Not the least of its charm is the personality 
of the little girl of eighty years ago. One sees in 
her both the beautiful, high-spirited mother and her 
gay, imperturbable father. Sophie is sweet and 
wilful, dainty and democratic. She enjoys the so- 



ciety and the black bread and butter of old 
Kersiflan, the lodge keeper, quite as much as -she 
likes being the pet of the great Marquis de L., who 
plays his flute for her and teaches her to enter 
a room gracefully. Her memories of the people 
of her childhood are very vivid, and her character 
drawing is delicate and sure. Just as present in 
her mind are the high-heeled slippers of Tante 
Rose, the border of golden oak leaves on Grand- 
father de Rosval's cloak and the orange velvet in 
which bonne maman looked like an old fairy. She 
recalls with zest the delicious Breton crepes made 
of malaga-flavored batter and the roasted sheep's 
tails on silver spits . No doubt her memory of the 
grass, which her cousin Jules insisted she learn to 
eat to be ready in case of famine, is even more 
vivid. The keen, restrained humor of the telling is 
quite Gallic. It is not one story but many. It is 
like an old brocade with the sun shining suddenly 
and warmly upon it, bringing out the many-colored 
silk threads and the intricate pattern woven into- 
an exquisite whole. Paul de Leslie's illustrations,, 
delicate of line and with few and salient details., 
are in sympathy with the text.

COMPAGNONS. By Georges Duhamel. 125 
pages. Nouvelle Revue Francaise, Paris. 

Readers of Bertrand Russell may cite Georges 
Duhamel as a conspicuous example of the recovery 
of the human soul in the face of a staggering uni- 
verse. Living four years in a world of intensified 
malignity, he returns, not with the sap of his soul 
dried up, but with it flowing richer and freer than 
ever. He has recoiled with a complete denial from 
an industrial and scientific civilization to take refuge 
in the interior life, in the cultivation of the souL 
In the midst of nauseating wounds he has pro- 
claimed anew the will-to-happiness. "Happiness is 
not only the aim, the reason of life: it is its prov- 
ince, its expression, its essence. It is life itself.. 
Happiness, you are the aim and reason for my ex- 
istence. I know that even in my tears." True riches, 
he decided while his ears were still assaulted by 
cannon-roars, are the quiet virtues of the soul. And 
he develops at length the last sentence of his previ- 
ous book, Civilization that civilization must be 
found in the heart of man. Mankind has heard this 
message many times before, but the force, the fer- 
vor, the contagious conviction with which Duhamel 
utters it has not been exemplified for a long time.. 
The New Book of Martyrs, taken as a whole, is even 
more convincing than the earlier books, but it 
still falls somewhat short of the possibilities of 
the subject. To do full justice to so tremendous a

Over a year ago, Mr. Ernest Poole wrote: "By all odds 
the most significant book I have read in the last year is 
UNDER FIRE. That seems to tower above all war stories 
that have yet been written. And still I feel that the 
greatest stories of the war will not be written in this 
vein. . . . Though the author shows again and again 
that if he cares to he can give the most terribly revealing 
glimpses into the soul of a man, ... he seems to keep 
showing us masses. ... I think that a greater novel

significant thing of the war is the story of its effect on 
one man's mind and spirit," and I shall be very greatly

sacrifice is beyond the art of man, but M. Duhamel 
fails to equal even the dubious adequacy of Andre 
Fribourg's Croire. Still, there is a simple, poignant 
realism in this collection of sketches of the pano- 
rama of pain and fortitude witnessed by a French 
military surgeon that goes far to compensate for 
the irritating style in which it is written. M. Du- 
hamel knows the tortured life he portrays, and only 
those who have gazed upon the same suffering can 
realize how terribly real it is, this "learning to 
live in Death's company." He has trodden those 
gloomy corridors carpeted with pain, between the 
long rows of cots laden with despair ; and the stories 
he tells of the sufferers, these martyrs of a new age, 
are not mere fictions: they are genuine, heartrend- 
ing planges de vie, of a life terrible to contemplate, 
told with a rare simplicity and lighted by a splen- 
did sympathy. They are a new Ave, Caesar, mori- 
turi te salutant. Nietzsche says that suffering en- 
nobles: and surely it is no common nobility to 
which their martyrdom has raised these men. It is 
a spiritual exaltation that fills their souls and tran- 
scends the sordidity and the commonplaces of their 
lives, and imparts to them a higher vision which 
they feel within them even if they cannot under- 
stand it. M. Duhamel has seen these things in the 
dying eyes of his countrymen, and he passes them 
on to us in The New Book of Martyrs. 

In contrast to the constructive but gloomy irony 
of Civilization and the rather patent pathos of 
La" Vie des Martyrs, the simplicity and sympathy 
with which his little volume of poems, Compagnons, 
is written are a delightful change. In it he is purely 
the poet of the people, a sort of French Whitman, 
free from all the barbarity of the American poet, 
and imbued with the delicate touch of his late com- 
rade in arms, Francois Coppee. For that- very 
reason, however, Duhamel is likely to be lost to 
the American public. Inspired as he is with the 
doctrines of Whitman, he lacks the latter's verbose 
strength to hammer his way into recognition; his 
national characteristic exhibits itself too profoundly 
in a sort of maladive super-sympathy with his fel- 
lowmen for his voice to be heard long above the 
noise and clatter of American industry. Yet his 
poetry is distinctly the poetry of the laboring man, 
the poetry of human sympathy; in his own words 
it is the poetry of "cordiality." It is not the form 
nor the nuance that Duhamel seeks, it is the naked 
truth, and that truth, itself, has no significance for 
him unless it be universal. His book, Compagnons, 
might be considered as the logical reaction against 
the estrangement which has developed between 
modern man and his fellows, as a direct protest 
against the creation of a human automaton which 
performs its social functions without any special 
regard for the other members of its society. Du- 
hamel attains his purpose through a medium purged 
of all superfluity, a medium of verse reduced to the 
fundamentals of grace and simplicity. In the poet- 



ry of Compagnons suggestion and symbolism are 
everything, the words themselves have little or no 
direct connotation. Yet Duhamel is no doctrinaire, 
he belongs to no fixed school of thought. He is 
merely a poet of the awakened conscience, preach- 
ing the doctrines of a regenerate Christianity. 

JOHN STUYVESANT AND OTHERS. By Alvin 
Johnson. 252 pages. Harcourt, Brace and 
Howe. 

This is a group of short stories, shorter stories, 
and sketches. The longest and most fully developed *" 
is the first, John Stuyvesant Ancestor. In this, as 
in the others, the emphasis is heaviest on character, 
with a social problem lurking in the background. 
John Stuyvesant is a most lovable baby, rather too 
summarily dismissed when the plot no longer needs 
him. The irritable, doggedly well-doing school 
principal who resents any intrusion upon his work 
finds his very foundations overturned at last when 
his intelligent wife refuses to fit any longer into 
his preconceived plan of things. Their "circle" 
with its footless discussions conjures up rare pic- 
tures Miss Platt, for instance, going through the 
eugenics report "like a bandsaw ripping through 
a log, knots and all." 

The plot is slight. Indeed throughout the book, 
plot is a negligible factor. Some of the sketches 
dispense with it altogether, substituting a point in- 
stead, and driving it home with well-placed blows. 
The woman question is the theme of a bit of keen 
satire in Suh-Ho in Praise of Footbinding. The 
same problem is touched upon sympathetically in 
several sketches. Its eternal obstacles come in for a 
good-natured buffeting in Phyllis the Feminist and 
Ivan the Terrible. Carnegied and The Molting of 
Alcibiades reveal another phase of natural law the 
impossibility of being original about growing old. 
Alcibiades' revolt over having all his actions pre- 
determined and labeled as the ones to be expected 
in a man past his prime is pathetic. 

Mr. Johnson has evidently been reading humanity 
for a long time and at close range. He has, be- 
sides, a trained intuition, the gift of swift, illuminat- 
ing definition and description. There is no waste 
diction, no straining after points. He introduces 
us to a number of people, most of them at outs 
with the world as they find it, and all of them 
dealt with from the standpoint of the social re- 
former, who pigeonholes people as so many social 
problems. Thus we meet the feminist, the liberal, 
the mob, the professor, the inventor, and even "the" 
poor Indian. We are reminded of the Bab Ballad: 

Come, step it, thirty-eight, 
And thirty-eight stepped out. 

Still the people of the stories are not merely stock 
samples of the human race. They possess indi- 
viduality in spite of their habit of falling readily 
into classes. Like his Gustav Kieselbacher, Mr. 
Johnson "sees things double, science and life."

"In the old days lived a pawnbroker named Jurgen: but 
what his wife called him was often very much worse than 
that. She was a high-spirited woman, with no especial gift 
for silence." 

So begins this high-hearted story of Mr. Cabell's. And 
the tale tells how, through the agency of a certain Black 
Gentleman, not always well spoken of, this wife of JURGEN'S 
disappears ; and how the pawnbroker went in search of her. 
JURGEN wanders, clad in a mystic shirt presented to him 
by a centaur, throughout his own past and in many coun- 
tries, searching for justice and rationality, and always find- 
ing adventure. He outwits sorcerers and gods and devils ; he 
struts imposingly at the Court of Gogyrvan Gawr, the father 
of Guenevere ; he gets the love of many women ; and in the 
end he gains not that which all men seek, but what the 
wise attain. 

JURGEN is an extravaganza, a satire, a Milesian tale 
compounded of deft fancy and gaiety and verbal beauty, 
with not a little of curious innuendo hidden in its pages. 
To the perceptive reader it will be something more than

rodomontade ; its characters never mere 
puppets. Mr. Trench's Napoleon is, in- 
deed, a fine achievement, clearly con- 
ceived, with a moving" and heroic story 
and characters."

Books of the Fortnight 

The Truth about China and Japan, by B. L. Putnam 
Weale (248 pages; Dodd, Mead), throws pro-Chinese 
reinforcements into the battle of words that rages 
around Shantung. The diplomatic background of 
today's discussion is described with some care, and 
the account is supplemented with reprints of the 
Lansing-Ishii notes and numerous Skio-Japanese state 
papers of recent date. Review later. 

The Awakening of Asia, by H. M. Hyndman (280 
pages; Boni & Liveright), was written before the Brit- 
ish post-war seizures in Asia and Africa marked a 
new and monstrous development of imperialism. And 
yet the author warns Europe against the coming of the 
great revenge, when the tide that threatened for a 
thousand years to sweep European civilization into 
the Atlantic will set westward again. Review later. 

The New Map of Asia, by Herbert Adams Gibbons (571 
pages; Century), asks and answers the question: 
Can a man believe in "the white man's burden" 
with all that this phrase implies and at the same 
time condemn what we fought Germany to destroy? 
Review later. 

Nationalities in Hungary, by Andre de Hevesy (247 
pages; T. Fisher Unwin, London), draws a not alto- 
gether sound analogy between the Entente's partition 
of Hungary and the reconstruction of Poland by these 
same powers. The author believes that the solution 
of the Hungarian problem lies not in enforced integra- 
tion or in wholesale partition, but in the formation 
of a United States of the Danube. Textually and 
mechanically the volume bears the marks of a propa- 
gandist publication. 

The Powers and Aims of Western Democracy, by 
William Milligan Sloane (489 pages; Scribner), is a 
survey of political facts and theories in which the 
scholarship of Gibbon is used to justify prejudices of 
Grubb Street. Review later. 

Municipal Government, by Fratik J. Goodnow and 
Frank G. Bates (453 pages; Century), is the second 
edition of a book that has held its own in its field 
for a whole decade. In spite of revision in the chap- 
ters dealing with finance, home rule, public utilities, 
and so forth Municipal Government is not up to date 
in political theory, and it now stands in need of a 
more searching criticism than it was possible to give 
the first edition. Review later. 

The New Spirit in Industry, by F. Ernest Johnson (95 
pages; Association Press), is indicative of the new 
spirit in the churches. It is a breathless, rapid-fire 
guide to labor and industrial problems an abridged 
Baedeker to the new world. In considering Professor 
Albion Small's plea for a commission to study indus- 
trial disputes the author takes for granted that the 
commission would be composed of men "whose chief 
qualification is not economic training or industrial ex- 
pertness, but so to say, ethical expertness." . A pro- 
posal which seems to indicate that the Church is 
innocent enough of scientific method to seek to blow 
down the walls of capitalism with a trumpet and 
build Jerusalem out of a prayer. 

Bolshevism and Social Revolt, by Daniel Dorchester 
(124 pages; Abingdon Press), supplies an ecclesiastic- 
al diadem for the new Divine Right of Kings. "Priv- 
ate property," says the author, "has a divine sanction 
and is one of the oldest of human institutions." 



Memoirs of the Russian Revolution, by George V. 
Lomonossoff (87 pages; Rand School), collects notes 
set down during the revolution of March 1917, when 
the author, by reason of his connection with the Revo- 
lutionary forces, had ample opportunity to observe 
the earliest activities of the Provisional Government. 

Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth 
Century, Volume VI, translated by Eden and Cedar 
Paul (670 pages; McBride), roves discursively over 
the period of 1830 to 1845, dealing principally with 
German home policy in its political aspects. Review 
later. 

The Crime, by the author of I Accuse (Vols. Ill and 
IV, 713 pages; Doran). The first two volumes of this 
work, previously published, dealt with Germany's war 
responsibility. The new volume, on War Aims, con- 
cerns itself chiefly with the utterances of Chancellor 
von Bethmann-Hollweg, and brings the discussion 
down to the end of September 1917. Volume IV deals 
with the German propagandist use of Belgian state 
papers captured in Brussels. 

What the War Teaches about Education, by Ernest 
Carroll Moore (334 pages ; Macmillan) , makes the 
discovery that only education can make democracy 
safe for the world. One is surprised at the admission 
that a victory for the Entente was not in itself suffi- 
cient for the accomplishment of this high aim. But 
this surprise vanishes when it is revealed t-hat the 
ideals set forth by the President in his message to 
the members of the Students Army Training Corps are 
to be those of America's after-the-war kultur. Review 
later. 

The Life .and Letters of James Monroe Taylor: The 

Biography of an Educator, by Elizabeth Hazelton 
Haight (391 pages; Dutton), increases the documenta- 
tion of the past generation by revealing the more obvi- 
ous intimacies of one who was President of Vassar 
College, 18861914. 

From Midshipman to Rear-Admiral, by Rear-Admir- 
al Bradley A. Fiske (693 pages; Century), recounts 
the experiences of an official career covering the half- 
century during which "navies have increased more than 
a hundredfold ... in the amount of destructive 
power they can exert." Admiral Fiske admits that 
he contributed a great deal to this development con- 
tributed much more than Secretary Daniels, whose 
inadequacies the Admiral discusses very frankly. 

Theodore Roosevelt: An Intimate Biography, by Wil- 
liam Roscoe Thayer (474 pages; Houghton Mifflin), 
offers little to justify its sub-title but the bare fact 
of acquaintance. It adds to that stream of Roosevel- 
tiana which never overflows the conventional banks 
of his personality. Review later. 

Bill Sewall's Story of T. R., by William Wingate Sew- 
all (116 pages; Harper), is an account of the Master, 
shortly to be canonized by the Memorial Commission, 
as related by one of the original apostles of his great- 
ness, a Maine guide. 

Artemus Ward: A Biography and a Bibliography, by 
Don. C. Seitz (338 pages; Harper), is the first com- 
plete biography of the man whose spelling is comically 
familiar in every American household. There is no 
evidence however that Charles Farrar Browne would 
ever, in the event of a longer life, have approached 
the depths plumbed by Mark Twain.

arcording to law, deposes and says that he is the business manager of 
The Dial, (Dial Publishing Co., Inc.), and that the following is, to 
the best of his knowledge and belief, a true statement of the ownership, 
management (and if a daily paper, the circulation), etc., of the aforesaid 
publication for the date shown in the above caption, required by the 
Act of August 24, 1912, embodied in section 443, Postal Laws and Regu- 
lations, printed on the reverse of this form, to wit:

Oswald W. Knauth, 27 West 67th St., New York City. 

2. That the owners are : (Give names and addresses of individual own- 
ers, or, if a corporation, give its name and the names and addresses of 
stockholders owning or holding 1% or more of the total amount of 
stock) The Dial Publishing Company, Inc., 152 W. 13th St., New York,

THE DIAL 



The Heart's Domain, by Georges Duhamel, translated 
by Eleanor Stimson Brooks (199 pages; Century), 
is reviewed on page 352. 

Books and Things, by Philip Littell (283 pages; Har- 
court, Brace & Howe; New York), collects a mis- 
cellany from the author's urbanely gossipy department 
in The New Republic, a department the more de- 
lightful for being rather lets bookish than thingy. Re- 
view later. 

The Theatre Through its Stage Door.by David Belas- 
co (246 pages; Harper), admits the reader to a 
realm of business as usual, where self-made actors 
and actresses win the rewards of ability, loyalty, and 
industry; one is surprised to find that Mr. Belasco's 
vocabulary is so largely that of Mr. Rockefeller and 
Mr. Carnegie. 

Plays: Second Series, by Jacinto Benavente, translated 
by John Garrett Underbill (309 pages; Scribner), 
adds to the already published first series four more 
plays by the Spanish dramatist : No Smoking, The 
Governor's Wife, Princess Bebe, and Autumnal Roses. 
The translator's preface to this volume, which is de- 
voted primarily to questions of technique, quotes a 
generous number of the playwright's "maxims and 
observations on the stage." The two volumes will be 
reviewed by Williams Haynes in an early issue. 

The Gibson Upright, by Booth Tarkington and Harry 
Leon Wilson (117 pages; Doubleday, Page), a play 
announced for Broadway production this season, was 
reviewed on page 115 of THE DIAL for August 9, fol- 
lowing its serial appearance in The Saturday Evening 
Post. 

Pictures of the Floating World, by Amy Lowell (257 
pages; Macmillan), is reviewed by Conrad Aiken on 
page 331. 

Haunts and By-Paths and Other Poems, by J. Thome 
Smith, Jr. (138 pages; Stokes), is too early in print. 
There are a few pieces here as notably Sea Song 
which will remain authentic of their maker's genuine, 
if not strikingly novel, imagery and lilting cadence; 
there are many passages in which he is fitfully pres- 
ent; and there is a great deal that might have been 
written by any not too clumsy apprentice to the poets. 
At least, the author of Biltmore Oswald has proved 
himself capable of something more enduring than war 
humor. 

A World of Windows, by Charles Hanson Towne (90 
pages; Doran.) If, as the jacket informs us, Mr. 
Towne "is a poet wherever he goes, and in whatever 
medium he writes," he has here given himself a great 
deal of supererogatory pains in rhythm and rhyme. 

Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice, by James Branch Cabell 
(368 pages; McBride), another narrative extravaganza 
by America's master ironist, is as blithely fantastic, 
as shrewdly pointed, and is launched with as impudent 
a flourish of spurious erudition as any of its pre- 
decessors. These were discussed by Wilson Follett 
in THE DIAL for April 25, 1918. Jurgen will be re- 
viewed shortly. 

The Four Roads, by Sheila Kaye-Smith (320 pages ; 
Doran), concerns itself with Sussex in war time, Half 
a dozen country folk are shown in their relations to 
the struggle; some of them are redeemed by it, some 
engulfed and ruined. Miss Kaye-Smith is truthful 
without being dogmatically pessimistic. Review later. 

Deadham Hard, by "Lucas Malet" Mary St. Leger 
Harrison (503 pages; Dodd, Mead), is reviewed on 
page 356. 



Iron City, by M. H. Hedges (318 pages ; Boni & Liv- 
eright), follows the parallel battle fronts between the 
old and the new attitudes in industrial and academic 
life. A first novel, its unusual merits in irony and 
sound characterization are obscured by familiar faults 
in direction and handling. 

Yellowleaf, by "Sacha Gregory" (319 pages; Lippincott), 
is an unusual handling of fascinating materials. Had 
the author carried it through on the plane in which 
he began, it would rank as an exceptional piece of 
work; but as he nears the climax his grip relaxes and 
the conclusion lacks conviction. Mr. Gregory's story 
is told with imaginative skill and keen insight. 

The Strongest, by Georges Clemenceau (317 pages;. 
Doubleday, Page) , gives a weak impression of the 
Tiger. Anatole France at his worst, say in The Red 
Lily, has limned a better picture of French society, 
whilst Henri Bordeaux at his best knows how to pro- 
vide a swifter plot. 

Oscar Montague Paranoiac, by George Lincoln Wal- 
ton, M. D. (303 pages ; Lippincott) , carries the hy- 
phen of the title into the text; it is part novel and, 
part treatise. 'Dr. Walton is the author of helpful 
books on Why Worry? and Those Nerves, which 
doubtless explains why his plunge into fiction is some- 
what clinical. 

John Stuyvesant Ancestor and Other People, by Alvin 
Johnson (252 pages; Harcourt, Brace, & Howe; New 
York), is reviewed on page 354. 

Our Casualty and Other Stories, by G. A. Birmingham 
(280 pages; Doran), in which the author of General 
John Regan groups some cheerful tales from the 
outer edges of the war, includes half a dozen choice 
specimens of Irish and Ulster psychology calculated 
to show how unsettling to either party would be any 
Irish settlement that settled anything. 

The Exploits of Bilge and Ma, by Peter Clark Mac- 
farlane (300 pages; Little, Brown), form a set of 
tales in which exposition fences for an equal place 
with narration. The volume is one of the less em- 
balmed kind of memorials to the destroyer fleet, and 
Admiral Sims' foreword is appropriate. Those who 
know the navy from the inside will find greatest 
amusement in the euphemisms whereby the author 
seeks to give the content of navy speech without us- 
ing the actual and unprintable form. 

The Doings of Raffles Haw, by A. Conan Doyle (199 
pages; Doran), appears to be the product of an idle 
hour, done perhaps for its author's own amusement, 
but rather too mechanical in its mystery to yield much 
fascination. 

Contributors

York and London until 1916 and was organist and

GRANVILLE 
Tales and Tail Spins from a Flier's Diary 

The literature of the War will contain many records of 
the achievements of our men over seas, but there will 
be little told of the brave host of youth who, anxious 
to sacrifice self to a great ideal, spent months in the 
training camps of America, drilling, studying, instruct- 
ing their fellow soldiers, and bending every effort 
toward taking an active part in the fighting. This 
unique book tells the story of the making of a soldier 
in one branch of the service / and gives an uncolored, 
intimate account of the experiences and thoughts of 
one of the youth who helped to win the war over here. 
It is edited from his diary and, in deference to the 
wishes of the family, is published anonymously.

GERMANY'S MORAL DOWNFALL 
The Tragedy of Academic Materialism 

By ALEXANDER W. CRAWFORD 

The war is over. On with the war! Many of the 
world's achievements have already been sacrificed to 
the Moloch of Kultur and its perfidious offspring, and 
the end is not yet. The military victory of the Allies 
has ended one phase of the World War, but the com- 
plete intellectual and moral victory is yet to be won. 
The menace of materialism, and its denial of morality 
and its worship of brute force, still hangs over the 
world and threatens its higher life. The task of the 
next generation is to uproot this cult of materialism 



that has insinuated itself into so many channels of 
national activity.

him. What religious knowledge is of most worth to 
the child, what religious attitudes to cultivate, what 
applications to make to the daily life and conduct are 
problems clearly set forth. What subject-matter we 
shall teach at different ages, and what we shall omit is 
discussed with full illustration. How we shall make

A FORTNIGHTLY 



The New Psychology and the Social Order 



L HE REVOLUTION IN PSYCHOLOGY at the end of the 
nineteenth century, associated with the name of 
Freud, has resulted during the past twenty-five 
years in a great volume of literature in which the 
point of view of the new psychology has been car- 
ried into medicine, philosophy, esthetics, and ethics, 
and some fruitful applications made of it also in cer- 
tain aspects of anthropology and history. It is true 
that the name of Freud has often been taken in vain, 
but such over-enthusiasm has rather emphasized the 
suggestiveness of the new point of view than de- 
tracted from the value of his method or of the in- 
sight it affords into sundry aspects of life. It was 
evident from the first that the significance of the 
new psychological point of view which he estab- 
lished could not be limited to the field of individual 
physical and mental therapeutics where it was first 
developed and applied. Though Freud himself 
has touched only a part of the vast field he opened, 
and his work has since been pushed farther than 
he himself would perhaps have ventured, his name 
has become such a talisman to conjure with because 
he put into our hands a key to certain chambers of 
the modern spirit which no injunction or caution 
could restrain us from opening. 

Psychology is of central importance in numerous 
departments of thought, but this revolution has af- 
fected them so greatly, and will affect them still 
more deeply, for a special reason. It was the first 
clear expression in definite human terms of the 
fundamental change in conception of life which 
has grown out of the revolution in the natural 
sciences during the sixteenth century, and out 
of the industrial revolution which was the first 
child of the scientific revolution and which has since 
set for us the form and mold of our whole lives. 
It furnished the first clear focus to the general 
movement of thought upon life that characterized 
the past five hundred years, and that first began to 
reflect itself distinctly in the deep-seated spiritual 
faithlessness and bewilderment of the nineteenth 
century reaching at length a world climax in the 
political and economic chaos of this century-long 
struggle we call reconstruction. 

That movement to indicate it briefly and rough- 



ly in general terms from the static, Platonic, dog- 
matic, idealistic, and deductive point of view of 
existence to the dynamic, Baconian, pragmatic, re- 
alistic, inductive, and creative view has touched 
all the sciences and arts and all aspects of thought 
and action in varying degrees in the past four hun- 
dred years, beginning with the physical sciences and 
extending through the biological sciences much 
later to the more speculative fields of thought. So 
far as any period of human history can be com- 
pressed into one meaning, the development of the 
creative point of view is the heart of the past four 
centuries. And so far as the upheaval in which 
they culminated has any single meaning and pur- 
pose it is the expression of the creative point of 
view in the social values and institutions of the race. 

Through the industrial system and the modern 
business organization, which are expressions of the 
creative impulse, no matter how they violate or 
obscure it practically at present, this renovation in 
thought has completely altered the conditions of 
our daily life and work and the bases of our thought 
without our being to any great degree conscious of 
it. Though most of our individual and group con- 
duct and our political, economic, and social insti- 
tutions either ignore or are directly opposed to it, 
the character of our modern life is shaped by the 
creative point of view. The machines which sprang 
from the pragmatic application of the physical 
sciences to the practical purposes of life have given 
us a point of view and a set of values we do not yet 
consciously understand, much less accept and ap- 
ply. They have opened up for us new outlooks, 
but we still fumble at them and try to run them with 
ideas that were hoary before the first machine was 
made, and that are fundamentally incompatible 
with the view of life out of which the machine has 
grown, for which it stands, and by which alone it 
can be effectively worked. We have, as yet, no 
consciousness, no, point of view of life which fits 
the machine and yet dominates it. Instead it still 
masters us through the senility of the ideas we bring 
to it. 

It is in the psychological relation between man 
and the machine, or in the widest sense between the 
race, with its mental equipment of ancient philo-

sophies, ethics, politics, economics, and religions, 
and the modern organization for work, that the 
heart of our modern problem lies. What we have 
here is a conflict of whole systems of impulses and 
ideas, racial, national, class, deeply ingrained in 
every individual, with a point of view and a new 
system of values and a new conception of life which 
the whole organization and daily conditions of 
modern life have enforced upon him. 

When we consider that this is a conflict that has 
arisen, broadly speaking, within the limits of a cen- 
tury, and has become acute really within a genera- 
tion, the intensity of the psychic strain involved in it 
is evident. Men can adjust themselves and their ideas 
to changes in the conditions of their work and ac- 
tivity in a few centuries without much psychic dis- 
turbance; but if a man is called upon to make a 
revision of his values and faiths and bases of judg- 
ment, such as was involved in the change from the 
medieval indoctrination to the creative view of life, 
in the span of his own working years, it is inevit- 
able that the mental upheaval will show itself in 
anomalies and abnormalities of conduct and psychic 
traits in himself and to a greater degree, perhaps, 
in the group to which he belongs. According to 
his strength, an individual may successfully make 
the mental revision, but in the group mind are col- 
lected and intensified all the strains and disturb- 
ances that take place in the less adaptable individ- 
uals. The resultant psychic disturbances are us- 
ually a magnification of the psychic traits which 
show themselves in an individual compelled to make 
some severe readjustment to reality, or to recognize 
some fact or take some view of life which he has 
ignored or opposed. 

When we examine these traits of group thought 
and conduct from this point of view it is clear how 
the valuations and realities upon which the creative 
view of life is based have acted like a repressed 
or ignored unconscious force in the consciousness of 
various social groups and molded their political 
and economic conduct. 

How deeply the thought of the common man has 
been colored by the creative point of view we shall 
probably not know until there is found some form 
of expression for it which he can understand and 
which brings it clearly to his consciousness. To put 
that point of view into terms whereby the common 
man can recognize it and accept it as his own is 
the object of the modern political and economic 
radical movements, and the heart of the reconstruc- 
tion agitation. Likewise the inadequacy of most 
of the attempts made thus far to embody the crea- 
tive point of view in such terms as will unite the 
common man for political and economic action is 



the main reason for the failure of these movements 
and for the chaos into which the reconstruction 
movement has dissolved. The new social leaders 
are confronted with a task somewhat similar to that 
of the psychoanalytic practitioner in the case of 
the individual, and they are obliged to have similar 
qualifications. They must show the group mind 
what it really wants, what deep forces lie beneath 
its immediate impulses and goals, what it really 
thinks about life, and lead it to accept openly the 
point of view which the new conditions and neces- 
sities of life impose, as well as the obligations that 
go with it, carrying them out with clear conscious- 
ness of their meaning. This applies especially to 
the so-called radical movements because it is these 
that the unconscious development of the creative 
valuation of life has stirred most profoundly. It 
is possible that some of the opposing conservative 
movements are in some degree also victims of the 
same unconscious pressure though they clothe it in 
opposing ancient ideologies and dogmatisms; we 
can never be sure what common impulse may be 
discovered at the root of the widest divergences of 
conduct and systems of ideas. This is a work that 
requires stripping away as gently as possible the 
incrustations of old impulses and ideas and values 
in which the new creative valuation of life is con- 
cealed and clothed, and it is evident that no one can 
do this work for a social group who does not him : 
self stand above or outside of the group and its 
system of ideas and valuations, or who himself is 
under the power and suffering under the strain of 
the psychic conflict which he is to try to interpret. 
For such social leaders to reveal to the group its 
underlying creative point of view and impulse and 
to interpret it with any psychoanalytic subtlety 
they must have in their hands a philosophy, an 
ethics, an art, a religious conception and of course 
a politics and an economics and a sociology which 
have been built upon or at least strongly touched 
by that new point of view. The lack of this has 
been in this social revolution as in most others the 
great handicap of the leaders. Though the crea- 
tive point of view has found so clear and effective 
an expression in the natural sciences and in biology 
and in the whole underlying process of our com- 
mon life, and had vaguely touched philosophy, 
ethics, art, religion, and the sociological sciences 
here and there during the last part of the nineteenth 
century, it has found practically no clear and defin- 
ite expression in politics and economics until now. 
For the most part their structure and approach re- 
mained pre-Baconian dogmatic. In trying to ex- 
press the modern creative point of view in material 
drawn from this contemporary philosophy, ethics, 
esthetics, religion, politics, and economics, the

modern radical social movements have been built 
on a quicksand and the whole structure of their 
thought has been warped and weakened. 

The clear expression of that point of view in the 
cornerstone of these several fields of thought 
psychology has opened new doors in each of them, 
given every branch of thought a new impetus and 
direction, and, most of all, equipped the movements 
for social reorganization with a weapon that ytill 
give them new strength. 

The new psychology brought the creative point 
of view definitely into philosophy and ethics, 
through the study of problems of the individual. 
It is possible that it may bring the creative point 
of view clearly into economics, politics, and sociol- 
ogy through a similar application of its method to 
the social problems which this reconstruction per- 
iod has brought to a head. 

The sociological sciences have as yet been least 
affected by that psychological revolution and the 
new point of view which it expresses, possibly be- 
cause economics, politics, and sociology are in 
turn dependent upon the natural sciences, medicine, 
philosophy, ethics, religion, art, as these are de- 
pendent upon psychology. Any change in the view 
of the human mind reflects itself in them largely 
at second hand, and after a long time. A change in 
economic methods and political structure does not 
mean an immediate corresponding change in eco- 
nomic and political science, for the sciences are 
governed more by tradition than by practical neces- 
sity. Though the structure of our political and 
economic life has changed many times in the past 
five hundred years, nevertheless our political ethics, 
economic philosophy, and social psychology are 
still largely dogmatic, deductive, and static. 

Up to the Peace Treaty we might have been for- 
given for thinking that we were seeing the begin- 
nings of a creative politics, but the outcome of the 
Conspiracy of Paris shows how greatly political 
thought is still paralyzed by the absolutist point of 
view. 

Social psychology in general is still marked al- 
most entirely by the old mechanical conception of 
the group mind and of the individual mind, and 
has scarcely outgrown the influence of Tarde and 
the nineteenth century psychologic anatomists. 
There are still traces in it of the Platonic psycho- 
logical conception that social ideas have an abso- 
lute, eternal, somewhat divine significance and 
origin. 

You have only to look at any textbook of eco- 
nomics written before 1910 to realize how little its 
approach has changed since The Wealth of Na- 
tions, ad what a scholastic thing most of the 
economics taught today still is, especially in its 



psychologic content, where it indeed has any. The 
preoccupation of all modern economic theory, since 
its beginning in the dawn of the industrial revolu- 
tion, has been with the same Platonic concepts and 
absolute ideas with which the schoolmen of the 
middle ages and the philosophers of the Academy 
of Athens disputatiously concerned themselves. 
Economic laws and processes still have in the mind 
of the academic professor and the textbook student 
of the science, as well as in the mind of the average 
business man, an aura of the absolute and the divine, 
and to all of them 'except possibly the modern busi- 
ness man economic life can be stuffed into certain 
rigid Platonic pigeonholes. And, more than all 
this, every sort of man, especially the common man 
when he is a patriot, is blithely willing to believe 
that all economics and economic laws are to such 
a degree abstract that they can all be abolished or 
ignored completely for the sake of some "big" ab- 
stract idea such as "making the world safe," and 
all that sort of thing. 

The interest of classical economics in psycho- 
logical motives was practically confined to the study 
of the concepts of value, interest, and so forth, and 
for the most part even the Austrian schools have 
gone little further than this, using still the old psy- 
chologic approaeh. Recently there has been more 
attention to the psychological factors in economics 
and in directions that lead away from the old psy- 
chological point of view. Veblen, Marot, and Tead, 
in analyzing the psychological factors in industry 
and in the business system, have come nearer the 
new point of view and have begun an application 
of the new psychology to social problems that 
promises a revolution in economics. In practical 
business men and industrial leaders there is already 
a clear realization of the ineffectiveness of mechan- 
ical readjustments of industry which do not touch 
the worker's psychological reaction. It might not 
be very inaccurate to call Veblen the Freud of 
economics, for though his work is, like Freud's, 
one-sided in its emphasis and far from comprehen- 
sive, it was the first to point out the influence of 
certain psychological forces in the maladjustments 
of industry and in the economic attitudes f certain 
classes, and to glimpse the influence of what might 
be called an economic libido. His analysis of the 
economic system has revealed more clearly than 
any other had done before the existence and work- 
ings of certain repressed or ignored forces in the 
functioning of the economic organism, and the part 
these play in group psychology. To judge how far 
such a tendency in economic thought has gone you 
have only to look for some evidence of its popular- 
ity in the classical academic circles and in the 
upper level of business Platonists. The new eco-

nomics is being made outside of university circles, 
the new politics outside of government offices, the 
new sociology comes out of Butte and Bethlehem 
and Baxter Street, where the new creative point of 
view presses hard and relentless against old ab- 
stractions. 

The essential difference between the creative view 
of life and what may be roughly called the mediev- 
al is that whereas the latter explained natural and 
human phenomena and human institutions by cer- 
tain preconceptions and as embodying certain dog- 
matic absolute principles or abstract ideas, the 
former looks upon life as a creative process in 
which all forms and modes and functions of exist- 
ence are relative to the creative discharge of power 
in maintaining and increasing life, which is a fun- 
damental, final thing, unanalyzable, and independ- 
ent of human preconceptions, constituting the ulti- 
mate basis of human judgment and action if they 
have any ultimate basis at all. If there be any 
divinity in the modern point of view it attaches only 
to the creative process and the creative impulse, 
which we identify with life itself as inviolable and 
sacred. The creative point of view is turned to- 
ward life, not away from it; looks to the earth, 
not to heaven; it embraces reality and does not 
flee from it; it knows only one prayer and that is 
work. "Its gods dwell in temples builded with the 
hands, and within the circle of actual experience is 
its creed made perfect and complete." 

The difference between the new psychology in 
which this view of life is so clearly expressed and 
the old is that the new clearly regards the organ- 
ism as not only an adaptive but much more as a 
creative unity, and consciousness as an adaptive and 
creative instrument whose phenomena are relative 
to the creative process of life. This "new psycho- 
logy" includes, of course, all those sterile, bleakly 
evolutionary points of view which look upon the 
phenomena of mind and conduct as more or less 
mechanical adaptive reactions and reduce life to 
minutely analyzed function or "behavior." The 
approach of this functional or behavioristic psy- 
chology is modern, but they represent only the raw 
transitional links between the whole of modern 
natural science and psychology, and without the 
insight of Freud they are a barren futility. In 
their fetishism of the evolution hypothesis, their 
evasion of the pragmatic facts of consciousness and 
their anatomizing of conduct they obscure the su- 
preme and essential fact of the indomitable creative 
flow of -life and reveal clearly the drag of their 
roots in the old medieval soil of categories and dis- 
sections. The old psychology, nothwithstanding 
all the refinements of post-Kantian criticism and 
the scraping and delving of the nineteenth century 



physiological psychologists with their ropes and 
pulleys, did not succeed in breaking away from the 
medieval or Platonic conception of the organism as 
a static composite of fixed, distinct parts body and 
mind and spirit and the mental faculties whose 
structure and functions were based on a priori prin- 
ciples or ideas. It is inevitable that such a psy- 
chology should come to a standstill, as it did by the 
end of the nineteenth century, and reflect itself in, 
among other things, an equally unprogressive soci- 
ology, economics, and politics. On the basis of 
the old psychology society and social, economic, 
and political institutions are more or less absolute 
things, representing permanent ideas, composed of 
distinct parts whose structure and functions are 
founded on certain fundamental abstract prin- 
ciples or ideals and proceed according to certain 
immutable laws. 

Once, however, whether by the influence of the 
natural sciences since 1500 or by the force of daily 
thought and action in the modern working world, 
life is seen as a creative process, and the organism 
in its growth and functions a vehicle of that process, 
the relativity and instrumentality of psychic phe- 
nomena are apparent and the whole view of social 
problems is changed. This results in a new ap- 
proach to the study of economic, political, and so- 
cial phases of group conduct, and means the be- 
ginnings of a creative economics, a creative poli- 
tics, a creative sociology, as well as a new kind of 
historical study in all these fields. 

It is not possible to set down here the bases and 
justification of the creative point of view nor of 
its historical evolution so far as we understand 
them. We are too close to the crest of the wave, and 
too much immersed in the movement of life of 
which it is an expression, to estimate its origin and 
meaning in any degree of fulness. The new valua- 
tions which that point of view must bring in philo- 
sophy, ethics, art, religion, and in our social, eco- 
nomic and political life and the expressions of these 
new valuations in our institutions this is the real 
subject of reconstruction thought and agitation. 
We can do nothing else than fairly accept it as the 
more or less consciously realized point of view of 
the age, an ineluctable movement of the human 
spirit, the natural fruition, if the evolution of 
thought has any meaning, of the last five hundred 
years, a thing that by its place in this century gives 
it something of the quality of a fin de millennium 
and makes the year 2000 of uncanny fitness as a 
turning point of human history.

Liberalism in Japan 



III. THE CHIEF FOE 



VUOMPARISONS OF JAPAN WITH GERMANY have be- 
come common, perhaps too common. At all events, 
they usually fail in my judgment to point out where- 
in the actual and undeniable likeness lies. The 
similarity is not so much intrinsic and indigenous 
as it is imitative and acquired. In the seventies and 
eighties Japan was busy studying the Western 
world for models, as one thousand years before she 
had studied Korea and China. From Great Britain 
she borrowed the idea of navalism, merchant ma- 
rine, sea commerce and sea power. From France she 
took the idea of centralized administration as a cure 
for the remaining ills of her centrifugal feudalism. 
From Germany she learned a technique for family 
law (a most important thing in transition from 
family organization to an individualistic basis) ; 
borrowed the aims and methods of an educational 
system, and the way of setting up an apparently 
Western or representative government which should 
not actually infringe in any \fray upon the autocratic 
oligarchy of the Choshu and Satsuma clan-leaders. 
Nor were the latter actuated wholly, nor possibly 
even chiefly, by personal ambitions. They were 
sure that only a high degree of centralized power 
would permit that development of army, navy, and 
a strong foreign policy which would save Japan 
from undergoing the same fate at the hands of 
Western powers that the rest of Asia was under- 
going. And in the face of the imperial Europe of 
the last generation, it would demand a boldness of 
idealism not possessed by the present writer to de- 
clare they were wholly wrong. 

Moreover the unification of Japan was only a 
recently accomplished fact. The foreigner is so 
used to hearing of the unity and community of the . 
life of the Far East, especially Japan, that he is 
likely to overlook the socially devisive force exer- 
cised by the family principle. In Japan, isolations 
and animosities had been acute all through the still 
recent feudal period. Japan had been hold together 
only by the force of the Tokugawas, and by their 
skill in playing one clan off against another. In 
connection with the restoration of Imperial unity 
and the opening of Japan to the outside world, 
Japan needed some internal and more spiritual 
bond of union. This she found in going Germany 
one better. In her past she had had a theocratic 
tradition which could be revived and put at the 
service of centralization. Japan has now had over 
a generation of education in a religion of state and 
emperor worship. Hence a new moral and intel- 
lectual flux can never be as eager, as open to new 



methods and institutions, as was the Japan of fifty 
years ago. There is a story told in Japan which 
does not sound authentic but which has a certain 
symbolic truth about it. It is said that when Mar- 
quis Ito and his commission on a constitution were 
on their way back to Japan fresh from Germany 
and Bismarck they stopped in London. Ito visit- 
ed Herbert Spencer, whose advice (and this is auth- 
entic enough) to Japan to keep foreign nations at 
arm's (and armed) length had given him great 
influence. And Ito, so goes the story, told the philo- 
sopher that he was taking home with him plans for 
a constitution, an educational system, economic de- 
velopment, and so forth in fact for everything 
except religion; and that he was depending upon 
Spencer to supply Japan with plans for that neces- 
sity. In reply, Spencer is said to have stated that 
since Japan had had ancestor worship and since the 
Emperor had been for ages a religious rather than 
a secular figure, she did not need to look abroad 
for plans to construct a national religion. 

This particular account of the calculated use of 
Shintoism as political support of militaristic auto- 
cracy may be doubted. But no student can doubt 
that the Elder Statesmen who in the later eighties 
set Japan upon its present track deliberately sur- 
rounded the Imperial dynasty will all the mystic 
emotional haloes and sanctions that accompany 
divinity and divine origin. It is not many centur- 
ies since Europe had states based on the divine 
right of kings; but we have to go back to Imperial 
Rome to find emperors who are themselves divine 
and the sons of gods. A Japanese scholar told me 
that till the publication of the Constitution in 1889 
the title Son of Heaven had been reserved for dead 
emperors, and that the deliberate use of religious 
myth for preventing the growth of democratic 
ideas was evident in the fact that in this document 
the title was for the first time applied to the living 
ruler. Of course I do not know whether his state- 
ment is correct, but there can be no doubt of the 
completeness of the fusion in the popular mind of 
political with religious and theocratic ideas, nor 
of the support the fusion gives to Japanese nation- 
alistic sentiment as against other nations, and to 
the prestige and power of the ruling dynasty. And 
since as matter of fact the Emperor is still almost 
as much of a figure-head as when he was in seclu- 
sion in Kyoto, this permeating religious sanction 
accrues to the benefit of the bureaucracy that actual- 
ly runs things. And it is interesting to note that 
one wing at least of the new liberal group is en-

deavoring to give the religious status of the Im- 
perial dynasty a democratic turn. They do not 
attack the imperial idea; the attack would not only 
throw them personally into prison but would render 
them so odious as to discredit their cause. They 
claim that traditionally the emperor has been the 
Father of the People, supremely interested in their 
welfare; that in the sense of government for the 
people Japan is historically a democracy; and then 
they attack the oligarchy which has turned Japan 
aside from its true basis, and which has for its own 
aggrandizement come between the emperor and his 
people. 

Westerners naturally have not taken Shintoism 
seriously as a political instrument. They have not 
taken the theocratic idea seriously. They could 
not; it is too alien to their ways of thinking. Hence 
they imagine that it is not taken seriously in Japan 
itself. They think of it as a kind of poetic em- 
bellishment, an additional romantic touch in a 
romantic land. And of course it is true that edu- 
cated men in Japan do not believe the political 
myths in any literal sense. But it is also true that 
the theocratic point of view governs the consider- 
ation of all questions, and that emotions connected 
with it are so pervasive and intense that Japan is 
a unique country, one whose aims and methods are 
baffling to any foreigner. Perhaps only the foreigner 
who makes a study of elementary education, es- 
pecially of the teaching of history and "ethics," 
realizes how systematic is the emperor-cult and 
how completely it becomes a part of the sub-con- 
scious mental apparatus of all the pupils. Those 
who throw it off may be compared to the few who 
in Western countries in earlier days threw off, as 
they grew up, the theological teachings of child- 
hood. The emotional after-effect can hardly be 
thrown off even then without a simultaneous casting 
off of patriotism and nationalistic feeling, so inti- 
mately religious has the dynastic sentiment become. 

Three myths compose the larger myth. First is 
the metion of complete racial homogeneity, of 
common blood, common descent, of common re- 
lationship to the gods who established civilization 
in Japan and whose descendants still rule the coun- 
try. This is the doctrine which practically has the 
most truth in it in spite of its ethnological falsity, 
for in the course of time the various ethnic ele- 
ments have got wonderfully fused together: Japan 
has not been an island and an isolated ore for 
nothing. This is also the myth which it is safest 
to question, foi all educated people are well aware 
of the different types that are found in the popu- 
lation. But it would hardly be safe to draw any 
political implications or conclusions from the denial 
of racial unity and common relationship to the 
emperor. The texts in "ethics" used in the schools 



teach that citizens of other countries have patriot- 
ism and that they also have filial and paternal af- 
fection, but that Japan is the only country in the 
world where the two things absolutely coincide. 
And a scientific ethnology which was punctilious 
enough to deny an objective literal basis for this 
statement would find itself in trouble. 

The second myth is that of the unbroken con- 
tinuity of the imperial dynasty for over twenty- 
five hundred years since the first imperial God 
settled in Japan. As a basis for this statement, 
children in school are gravely taught a lot of myths 
about the formation of Japan and its earliest his- 
tory which intellectually and esthetically are not 
on a level with the legends of the North American 
Indians. Then the actual facts of history which 
prove anything but continuity of blood and unity 
of dynasty are systematically falsified. The myth 
of single and pure descent of the imperial house 
which has existed from time immemorial and which 
will continue to exist for ages eternal is proclaimed 
in the very beginning of the German-borrowed 
constitution of Japan and remains the cornerstone 
of the Japanese state. The third myth is the con- 
summation of the other two. All that Japan is and 
can become she owes to the original virtues of the 
divine founders and to those of their divine des- 
cendants. The moral as to what the citizen of Japan 
owes the imperial dynasty is obvious, and the teach- 
ing of ethics and history in the common schools 
takes no chances that it will not be made plain. It 
is not surprising that the fanatical apostles of these 
doctrines have more than once allowed their little 
charges to perish in flame and smoke while they 
saved the portrait of the divine emperor. 

University teachers in their classrooms tell the 
historic truth. They fulfill orally the obligations 
of historic scholarship. But such higher criticism 
is confined to the confidence of the classroom. 
Martyrdom is not wooed by setting forth the facts 
in printed form for general consumption. Some- 
times I think that the surest sign of the approach 
of democracy will be given when we read that a 
group of intellectuals have braved prison or death 
by setting forth to the public the truth about such 
matters. 

I am afraid I may seem to have got completely 
away from my subject. I seem to be speaking not 
of liberalism in Japan but of the most insidious 
and influential type of reactionarism. But it is 
worth while to know the difficulties with which the 
growth of liberalism has to contend. The know- 
ledge will make us more sympathetic and more pa- 
tient. The liberalism is there, and it is coming to 
possess the present generation of university-taught 
men. Since I began writing, a delegation of Jap-

anese University students has been in Peking to 
express to the Chinese their entire lack of sympathy 
with the policy of Japan towards China, and to 
say that their enemy is a common one Japanese 
militaristic autocracy. It is impossible for Japan 
to engage in trade, to exchange commodities and 
technical science with all the world, to take a part 
in world politics, and still to remain isolated from 
the world situation and world currents. The signi- 
ficance of this fact has been brought home to Japan 
with increasing acceleration and momentum by the 
war and its conclusion, and the outcome is the 
present spread of democracy and liberalism. The 



imperialistic settlement at Paris has undeniably 
effected a setback. Every reaction from democracy 
all over the world will retard the movement in 
Japan. But unless the world overtly and on a large 
scale goes back on democracy, Japan will move 
steadily in that direction. And my own confidence 
in the resilience, adaptability, and practical intel- 
ligence of the Japanese people, as well as in a kind 
of social democracy which is embodied in the man- 
ners and customs of the people, makes me think 
the change will come without a bloody and catastro- 
phic upheaval.

R 



Mr. Masefield Chases a Fox 



IEYNARD THE FOX, or The Ghost Heath Run 
(Macmillan) or, as Oscar Wilde would have 
called it, a tale of the Unspeakable in pursuit of 
the Uneatable is as brilliant a study in rhyme as 
any that Mr. Masefield has yet done. With a hand 
long since grown sure and steady in his craft, he 
has passed across the somewhat faded colors of the 
Fourteenth Century Dutch fable a cloth dipped in 
an astonishingly glowing and fluid technique. The 
result is a picture as vivid as a mirror set in the 
sunshine. Though the external handling of the 
poem appears slightly monotonous upon a close 
examination (the work is entirely in couplets), 
that monotony is apparent only to those pundits 
who fletcherize their poetry with their eyes; for 
beneath the mechanical tramp of the poem ring out 
always the sharp hoof-beats of high-strung horses 
sniffing the chase, and across the drab background 
of a seemingly monotonous verse-form dash con- 
tinually the bright red coats of country gentlemen, 
lean hounds with their noses set hungrily to the 
ground, and a whole army of hunters men, dogs, 
and horses galloping pell-mell over the heaths 
and hills of North England. The picture is both 
vigorous and nervous. And barring a lengthy pre- 
amble to the actual hunt a preamble whose weight 
and length entirely overbalance the rest of the 
canvas he has conceived an able portrait of Rey- 
nard the Fox, and executed a lupine epic that is 
really notable. 

But the question arises: Is a fox worth so much 
attention? There is a theory which regularly goes 
the rounds of ateliers to the effect that the portrait 
of a boil can be as great as the portrait of Beetho- 
ven. Certainly manner is esthetically as important 
as matter. Occasionally it may be more important. 
To portray the terrors of a harried fox with Mr. 
Masefield's skill cannot but win the technical ad- 
miration of both his advocates and his detractors. 



But beneath the admiration will rankle resentment 
that a man who can write The Widow in The Bye 
Street now spends his energies in writing so long 
and so elaborate a tale about the plucky endurance 
of a frightened animal that an artist who is able 
to hunt down souls in cadences of poignant beauty 
has wasted probably the best part of a year, in 
the full ripeness of his powers, chasing a fox 
around a shire. 

Some of this same disappointment and resent- 
ment is raised by his play The Faithful ('Mac- 
millan), recently and courageously presented at 
the Garrick fheatre in New York by the Theatre 
Guild. According to a note on the program there 
have already been given to the world no less than 
104 dramatic treatments of the ancient Japanese 
legend on which Mr. Masefield based his play. It 
is easy to be captious with a man of Mr. Mase- 
field's ability, because his achievement to date has 
set a very stiff standard for him to live up to, and 
success carries its own penalties as well as its 
own rewards. But, again, is it over -critical to ask: 
Why the one hundred and fifth? There is a place 
on our stage for the dramatization of customs and 
taboos alien to our own; but the Caucasian who 
can put an authentic note of tragic renunciation 
into a stage representation of hara-kiri is a rara 
avis. Mr. Masefield's wings scarcely hold him up in 
Japanese air. 

Less pretentious a flight, however, and undoubt- 
edly more compelling for that very reason, is the 
collection of his short stories and miniatures of the 
sea, new grouped tinder the title A Tarpaulin Muster 
(Dodd, Mead). So far Mr. Masefield has built 
his reputation chiefly on land and poetry. A poet 
he always will be, wherever he walks. But A Tar- 
paulin Muster generally corroborates the miracu- 
lous testimony offered some years ago by A Round

House and Salt Water Ballads to wit, that he 
can walk as successfully on sea as on land; more 
than that, that he can walk as vigorously and com- 
fortably on prose as on poetry. The prose of most 
poets is so notoriously bad that it does not even 
call for censure; so if this slightly random col- 
lection of Mr. Masefield's were flat, stale, and 
stylistically unprofitable, or if the author had 
drowned himself in syntax, no one could have 
been especially surprised. The surprise unless 
you have read Gallipoli Shambles, for example 
is distinctly on the other side of your brain. The 
truth is, Mo Masefield's prose style is not only very 
good for a poet it promises to be very good for 



his reputation. Slight as most of these sketches are 
several of them are merely dashes of salt water 
they have, by and large, a quality which can be 
quickly named only by calling rather tiresomely, if 
rather inevitably, on Joseph Conrad. Now that Mr. 
Masefield has rounded the Cape of War, it does not 
seem too much to expect that the winds of his 
imagination will steady and grow, and that ulti- 
mately we may expect a Typhoon from his quarter. 
Whether that Typhoon will be in prose or in 
verse will not matter. For, in either case, unless 
Mr. Masefield fails both land and sea, and himself, 
it will be in poetry.

THE NEW DECAMERON (McBride) the worst 
should be admitted at once. The integrating idea 
is pure diamond, but it is still locked in its matrix. 
Certainly the clay should have been chubbed off 
and the idea cut to a form suitable to its weight. 
The facets are all there in posse; but they are with- 
out refractive power, and many hunters of the good 
will step over without dreaming the radiance 
buried in this book. 

It would appear useless to expostulate such an 
inexcusable waste if there were not the promise 
of more out of the same diggings. The publishers 
imply a second day of tales, a third, a fourth, and 
still others. It is time to call a stop. Second nor 
third nor any more must be issued in the careless 
phlegm of the first. An idea of unguessed ampli- 
tude was degraded there. It would be better to 
kill the idea than to mutilate it like that. 

The country has long lacked an adequate con- 
veyance for the better "unavailable" short fiction 
that goes begging for a home in type. Many thou- 
sands of short-stories are called by the magazines; 
but few are chosen, and these only in conformity 
with a bird's-eye policy which can tell you within 
one inch what the readers want! The rest the 
stories that lack punch in the first ten lines the 
love-labors of our great professionals before they 
sold their birthright of excellence in what pigeon- 
hole, in what oubliette or garbage can are they 
concealed during this long night of best-sellers? 
At present the editors of our magazines determine 
precisely what stories the world shall read; and 
whatever unknown masterpieces have been con- 
demned by their policies must repose and rot in 
the mortuary trunk. 

If a writer, in ghastly compliance with the edi- 
torial hunch, should slog a selling idea out of his 



skull, he must let the editor create a demand for 
this new commodity by advertising it in the street- 
cars like cough syrup or depilatory powders. In 
the first instance it is often as not a work of in- 
spiration, but in the second, in the third or soon 
it is only a dulled and oxidized repetition of one 
good idea. In time, too, the reader acquires the 
taste and expects to get what he pays for. There 
is no stopping then. The writer is committed to 
a fashion ^a commercial product. He is a slave 
at his type-mill. He cannot escape. Sometimes 
he would like to jib away and explode a provoca- 
tive idea he carries at heart; but the law is that he 
must doll his children in the one and only style 
of his initial success. 

Here, then, both for the unsold obliquely-beauti- 
ful brain-waifs and for the insurgent flashes of the 
best-selling, was and is, and will be the oppor- 
tunity of the New Decameron. McBride & Co., in 
this' procrustean series, have conceived an outlet 
for short-stories that would otherwise never be 
seen. Only the sad thing is they have missed 
the high privileges of their conception. It was 
possible to select fine tales instead of these inchoate 
permutations. It was possible to take the project 
seriously enough to be above such persiflage as 
that flip prologue, of doubtful mood and direction. 
Two courses were open at the outset. One and 
incomparably the better was to salvage material 
that is frankly unmarketable because its error is on 
the side of genius. The other was to enter with 
the magazines and buy popular stuff. The pub- 
lishers ignored both, and the result is a pathetic 
abortion. If they continue as they should in all 
conscience, for here is a noble chance it will be 
necessary to choose between these two courses. 

As it stands, the New Decameron is like, any-

thing but its original. No one should take this 
divergence unkindly, after six hundred years. 
Anglo-Saxon folk, being sincere hypocrites, invari- 
ably except against Boccaccio's gusty glee of sex, 
and that is accordingly left out. Prurient youth 
will search in vain for the "good ones!" Boccaccio 
devised a hundred tales ten apiece for his ten 
narrators. In this New Decameron the tales are 
collaborated by different authors in something bet- 
ter than the ancient monotony of style. 

The book begins with a gawking prologue and 
takes a few short, experimental flops in narrative. 
A diversified group of the humanary appears in 
a train rushing down through the hop country of 
England. It is a tour that they are about, and they 
reach the coast in panoply. The engine which 
should propel their yacht across the channel-chops 
declines the office with a callithumpian jolt. In 
this dilemma the facile leader of the tour suggests 
to pass the time by telling tales. Each member of 
the party has his turn. Boccaccio's merry ladies, 
sitting by a fountain on the lawn, "untroubled of 
any fly," concluded their daily sessions with a love- 
ditty by any one of the company while the others 



responded. In sort the leader of the modern story- 
tellers executes a little song, and the first day is 
done. 

One tale is as bad as another. All betray stig- 
mata that would arouse such editorial cholers as 
to preclude publication in the magazines. Also 
they lack integration, clarity, salt. Of course the 
best story a man tells is about himself; and these 
men and women, as characters in a work of fiction, 
succeed without trying, it seems in getting some- 
thing intensely personal across, like old Chaucer's 
pilgrims. On the last page it comes to you the 
possibility of strangers in the world, a segregation 
of human souls, voyaging together in the way men 
love; and their story-telling but the natural and 
spontaneous effort to learn what each and other 
makes out the riddle of life. Incorrigible optim- 
ism welcomes the New Decameron, in spite of its 
present fault, to a rich fulfillment of its dazzling 
possibilities. In days to come these same voices 
will ravel more tales out of other experiences in 
other places while the hours blow in the crazy winds. 
Let them ravel rarely!

Bolshevism and the Vested Interests in America 

III. A MEMORANDUM ON A PRACTICABLE SOVIET OF TECHNICIANS 



IT is THE PURPOSE of this memorandum to show, 
in an objective way, that under, existing circum- 
stances there need be no fear, and no hope, of 
an effectual revolutionary overturn in America, 
such as would unsettle the established order and 
unseat those Vested Interests that now control the 
country's industrial system. In an earlier paper 
(THE DIAL, October 4) it has been argued that 
no effectual move in the direction of such an over- 
turn can be made except on the initiative and under 
the direction of the country's technicians, taking 
action in common and on a concerted plan. Notor- 
iously, no move of this nature has been made 
hitherto, nor is there evidence that anything of the 
kind has been contemplated by the technicians. 
They still are consistently loyal, with something 
more than a hired-man's loyalty, to the established 
order of commercial profit and absentee ownership. 
And any adequate plan of concerted action, such 
as would be required for the enterprise in question, 
is not a small matter that can be arranged between 
two days. 

Any plan of action that sfiall hope to meet the 
requirements of the case in any passable fashion 
must necessarily have the benefit of mature delib- 
eration among the technicians who are competent 
to initiate such an enterprise; it must engage the 



intelligent co-operation of several thousand tech- 
nically trained men scattered over the face of the 
country, in one industry and another; must carry 
out a passably complete cadastration of the coun- 
try's industrial forces; must set up practicable 
organization tables covering the country's industry 
in some detail, energy-resources, materials, and 
man power; and it must also engage the aggressive 
support of the trained men at work in transporta- 
tion, mining, and the greater mechanical industries. 
These are initial requirements, indispensable to 
the initiation of any enterprise of the kind in such 
an industrial country as America; and so soon as 
this is called to mind it will be realised that any 
fear of an effectual move in this direction at 
present is quite chimerical. So that, in fact, it 
may be set down without a touch of ambiguity that 
absentee ownership is secure, just yet. 

Therefore, to show conclusively and in an objec- 
tive way how remote any contingency of this nature 
still is, it is here proposed to set out in a summary 
fashion the main lines which any such concerted 
plan of action would have to follow, and what 
will of necessity be the manner of organization 
which alone can hope to take over the industrial 
system, following the eventual abdication or dis- 
posession of the Vested Interests and their absentee

owners. And, by way of parenthesis, it is always 
the self-made though reluctant abdication of the 
Vested Interests and their absentee owners, rather 
than their forcible dispossession, that is to be look- 
ed for as a reasonably probable event in the cal- 
culable future. It should, in effect, cause no sur- 
prise to find that they will, in a sense, eliminate 
themselves, by letting go quite involuntarily after 
the industrial situation gets quite beyond their 
control. In fact, they have, in the present difficult 
juncture, already sufficiently shown their unfitness 
to take care of the country's material welfare, 
which is after all the only ground on which they 
can set up a colorable claim to their vested rights. 
At the same time something like an opening bid 
for a bargain of abdication has already come in 
from more than one quarter. So that a discon- 
tinuance of the existing system 'of absentee owner- 
ship, on one plan or another, is no longer to be 
considered a purely speculative novelty; and an 
objective canvass of the manner of organization that 
is to be looked to to take the place of the control 
now exercised by the Vested Interests in the event 
of their prospective abdication should according- 
ly have some present interest, even apart from its 
bearing on the moot question of any forcible disrup- 
tion of the established system of absentee ownership. 

As a matter of course, the powers and duties of 
the incoming directorate will be of a technological 
nature, in the main if not altogether; inasmuch 
as the purpose of its coming into control is the 
care of the community's material welfare by a more 
competent management of the country's industrial 
system. It may be added that even in the unexpect- 
ed event that the contemplated overturn should, 
in the beginning, meet with armed opposition from 
the partisans of the old order, it will still be true 
that the duties of the incoming directorate will be 
of a technological character, in the main ; inasmuch 
as warlike operations are also now substantially 
a matter of technology, both in the immediate con- 
duct of hostilities and in the still more urgent work 
of material support and supply. 

The incoming industrial order is designed to 
correct the shortcomings of the old. The duties 
and powers of the incoming directorate will accord- 
ingly converge on those points in the administra- 
tion of industry where the old order has most 
signally fallen short; that is to say, on the due 
allocation of resources and a consequent full and 
reasonably proportioned employment of the avail- 
able equipment and man power; on the avoidance 
of waste and duplication of work; and on an equit- 
able and sufficient supply of goods and services 



to consumers. Evidently the most immediate and 
most urgent work to be taken over by the incom- 
ing directorate is that for want of which under 
the old order the industrial system has been work- 
ing slack and at cross purposes; that is to say the 
due allocation of available resources, in power, 
equipment, and materials, among the greater prim- 
ary industries. For this necessary work of alloca- 
tion there has been substantially na provision under 
the old order. 

To carry on this allocation, the country's trans- 
portation system must be placed at the disposal of 
the same staff that has the work of allocation to 
do; since, under modern conditions, any such allo- 
cation will take effect only by use of the transporta- 
tion system. But, by the same token, the effectual 
control of the distribution of goods to consumers 
will also necessarily fall into the same hands; 
since the traffic in consumable goods is also a mat- 
ter of transportation, in the main. 

On these considerations, which would only be 
reenforced by a more detailed inquiry into the 
work to be done, the central directorate will ap- 
parently take the shape of a loosely tripartite execu- 
tive council, with power to act in matters of indus- 
trial administration; the council to include tech- 
nicians whose qualifications enable them to be call- 
ed Resource Engineers, together with similarly com- 
petent spokesmen of the transportation system and 
of the distributive traffic in finished products and 
services. With a view to efficiency and expedition, 
this executive council will presumably not be a 
numerous body; although its staff of intelligence 
and advice may be expected to be fairly large, and 
it will be guided by current consultation with the 
accredited spokesmen (deputies, commissioners, 
executives, or whatever they may be called) of the 
several main subdivisions of productive industry, 
transportation, and distributive traffic. 

Armed with these powers and working in due 
consultation with a sufficient ramification of sub- 
centers and local councils, this industrial director- 
ate should be in a position to avoid virtually all 
unemployment of serviceable equipment and man 
power on the one hand, and all local or seasonal 
scarcity on the other hand. The main line of duties 
indicated by the character of the work incumbent 
on the directorate, as well as the main line of quali- 
fications in its personnel, both executive and ad- 
visory, is such as will call for the services of Pro- 
duction Engineers, to use a term which is coming 
into use. But it is also evident that in its continued 
work of planning and advisement the directorate 
will require the services of an appreciable number 
of consulting economists; men who are qualified to 
be called Production Economists. 



1919

The profession now includes men with the requi- 
site qualifications, although it cannot be said that 
the gild of economists is made up of such men in the 
main. Quite blamelessly, the economists have, by 
tradition and by force of commercial pressure, 
habitually gone in for a theoretical inquiry into 
the ways and means of salesmanship, financial 
traffic, and the distribution of income and property, 
rather than a study of the industrial system con- 
sidered as a ways and means of producing goods 
and services. Yet there now are, after all, especial- 
ly among the younger generation, an appreciable 
number, perhaps an adequate number, of econom- 
ists who have learned that "business" is not "in- 
dustry" and that investment is not production. And, 
here as always, the best is good enough, perforce. 

"Consulting economists" of this order are a 
necessary adjunct to the personnel of the central 
directorate, because the technical training that 
goes to make a resource engineer, or a production 
engineer, or indeed a competent industrial expert 
in any line of specialization, is not of a kind to 
give him the requisite sure and facile insight into 
the play of economic forces at large; and as a 
matter of notorious fact, very few of the technicians 
have gone at all far afield to acquaint themselves 
with anything more to the point in this connection 
than the half-forgotten commonplaces of the old 
order. The "consulting economist" is accordingly 
necessary to cover an otherwise uncovered joint in 
the new articulation of things. His place in the 
scheme is analogous to the part which legal counsel 
now plays in the manoeuvers of diplomatists and 
statesmen; and the discretionary personnel of the 
incoming directorate are to be, in effect, something 
in the way of industrial statesmen under the new 
order. 

There is also a certain general reservation to be 
made with regard to personnel, which may conveni- 
ently be spoken of at this point. To avoid persist- 
ent confusion and prospective defeat, it will be 
necessary to exclude from all positions of trust 
and executive, responsibility all persons who have 
been trained for business or who have had experi- 
ence in business undertakings of the larger sort. 
This will apply generally, throughout the adminis- 
trative scheme, although it will apply more im- 
peratively as regards the responsible personnel of 
the directorate, central and subordinate, together 
with their staff of intelligence and advice, where- 
ever judgment and insight are essential. What is 
wanted is training in the ways and means of pro- 
ductive industry, not in the ways and means of 
salesmanship and profitable investment. 

By force of habit, men trained to a businesslike 



view of what is right and real will be irretrievably 
biassed against any plan of production and dis- 
tribution that is not drawn in terms of commercial 
profit and loss and does not provide a margin of 
free income to go to absentee owners. The per- 
sonal exceptions to the rule are apparently very 
few. But this one point is after all of relatively 
minor consequence. What is more to the point in 
the same connection is that the commercial bias 
induced by their training in businesslike ways of 
thinking leaves them incapable of anything like 
an effectual insight into the use of resources or 
the needs and aims of productive industry, in any 
other terms than those of commercial profit and 
loss. Their units and standards of valuation and 
accountancy are units and standards of price, and 
of private gain in terms of price; whereas for any 
scheme of productive industry which runs, not on 
salesmanship and earnings, but on tangible per- 
formance and tangible benefit to the community at 
large, the valuations and accountancy of salesman- 
ship and earnings are misleading. With the best 
and most benevolent intentions, men sp trained will 
unavoidably make their appraisals of production 
and their disposition of productive forces in the 
only practical terms with which they are familiar, 
the terms of commercial accountancy; which is the 
same as saying, the accountancy of absentee own- 
ership and free income; all of which it is the abid- 
ing purpose of the projected plan to displace. For 
the purposes of this projected new order of produc- 
tion, therefore, the experienced and capable busi- 
ness men are at the best to be rated as well-inten- 
tioned deaf-mute blind men. Their wisest judg- 
ment and sincerest endeavors become meaningless 
and misguided so soon as the controlling purpose 
of industry shifts from the footing of profits on 
absentee investment to that of a serviceable output 
of goods. 

All this abjuration of business principles and 
businesslike sagacity may appear to be a taking 
of precautions about a vacant formality; but it 
is as well to recall that by trained propensity and 
tradition the business men, great and small, are 
after all, each in their degree, lieutenants of those 
Vested Interests which the projected organization 
of industry is designed to displace, schooled in 
their tactics and marching under their banners. 
The experience of the war administration and its 
management of industry by help of the business 
men during the past few years goes to show what 
manner of industrial wisdom is to be looked for 
where capable and well-intentioned business men 
are called in to direct industry with a view to 
maximum production and economy. For its re- 



376 



THE DIAL

sponsible personnel the administration has uni- 
formly drawn on experienced business men, pre- 
ferably men of successful experience in Big Busi- 
ness; that is to say, trained men with a shrewd eye 
to the main chance. And the tale of its adventures, 
so far as a businesslike reticence has allowed them 
to become known, is an amazing comedy of errors; 
which runs to substantially the same issue whether 
it is told of one or another of the many depart- 
ments, boards, councils, commissions, and adminis- 
trations, that have had this work to do. 

Notoriously, this choice of personnel has with 
singular uniformity proved to be of doubtful ad- 
visability, not to choose a harsher epithet. The 
policies pursued, doubtless with the best and most 
sagacious intentions of which this businesslike per- 
sonnel have been capable, have uniformly resulted 
in the safeguarding of investments and the alloca- 
tion of commercial profits; all the while that the 
avowed aim of it all, and doubtless the conscien- 
tious purpose of the businesslike administrators, 
has been quantity production of essential goods. 
The more that comes to light, the more visible be- 
comes the difference between the avowed purpose 
and the tangible performance. Tangible perform- 
ance in the way of productive industry is precisely 
what the business men do not know how to pro- 
pose, but it is also that on which the possible suc- 
cess of any projected plan of overturn will always 
rest. Yet it is also to be remarked that even the 
reluctant and blindfold endeavors of these business- 
like administrators to break away from their life- 
long rule of reasonable earnings, appear to have 
resulted in a very appreciably increased induslrial 
output per unit of man power and equipment em- 
ployed. That such was the outcome under the war 
administration is presumably due in great part to 
the fact that the business men in charge were unable 
to exercise so strict a control over the working 
force of technicians and skilled operatives during 
that period of stress. 

And here the argument comes in touch with one 
of the substantial reasons why there need be no 
present fear of a revolutionary overturn. By set- 
tled habit, the American population are quite unable 
to see their way to entrust any appreciable respon- 
sibility to any other than business men; at the 
same time that such a move of overturn can hope 
to succeed only if it excludes the business men 
from all postions of responsibility. This senti- 
mental deference of the American people to the 
sagacity of its business men is massive, profound, 
and alert. So much so that it will take harsh and 
protracted experience to remove it, pr to divert it 
sufficiently for the purposes of any revolutionary 



diversion. And more particularly, popular senti- 
ment in this country will not tolerate the assump- 
tion of responsibility by the technicians, who are 
in the popular apprehension conceived to be a 
somewhat fantastic brotherhood of over-specializ- 
ed cranks, not to be trusted out of sight except 
under the restraining hand of safe and sane busi- 
ness men. Nor are the technicians themselves in 
the habit of taking a greatly different view of their 
own case. They still feel themselves, in the nature 
of things, to fall into place as employes of those 
enterprising business men who are, in the nature 
of things, elected to get something for nothing. 
Absentee ownership is secure, just yet. In time, 
with sufficient provocation, this popular frame of 
mind may change, of course; but it is in any case 
a matter of an appreciable lapse of time. 

Even such a scant and bare outline of generalities 
as has been hastily sketched above will serve to 
show that any effectual overturn of the established 
order is not a matter to be undertaken out of hand, 
or to be manoeuvred into shape by makeshifts after 
the initial move has been made. There is no chance 
without deliberate preparations from beforehand. 
There are two main lines of preparations that will 
have to be taken care of by any body of men who 
may contemplate such a move: (a) An inquiry 
into existing conditions and into the available ways 
and means; and (b) the setting up of practicable 
organization tables and a survey of the available 
personnel. And bound up with this W9rk of prep- 
aration, and conditioning it, provision must also 
be made for the growth of such a spirit of team- 
work as will be ready to undertake and undergo 
this critical adventure. All of which will take time. 

It will be necessary to investigate and to set 
out in a convincing way what are the various kinds 
and lines of waste that are necessarily involved in 
the present businesslike control of industry; what 
are the abiding causes of these wasteful and ob- 
structive practices; and what economies of man- 
agement and production will become practicable 
on the elimination of the present businesslike con- 
trol. This will call for diligent team-work on the 
part of a suitable group of economists and engin- 
eers, who will have to be drawn together by self- 
selection on the basis of a common interest in pro- 
ductive efficiency, economical use of resources, and 
an equitable distribution of the consumable output. 
Hitherto no such self-selection of competent per- 
sons has visibly taken place, and the beginnings 
of a plan for team-work in carrying on such an 
inquiry are yet to be made. 

In the course of this contemplated inquiry and 
on the basis afforded by its findings there is no 



1919 



THE DIAL 



377 



less serious work to be done in the way of delibera- 
tion and advisement, among the members of the 
group in question and in consultation with out- 
side technological men who know what can best 
be done with the means in hand, and whose interest 
in things drives them to dip into the same gain- 
less adventure. This will involve the setting up 
of organization tables to cover the efficient use of 
the available resources and equipment, as well as 
to re-organize the traffic involved in the distribu- 
tion of the output. 

By way of an illustrative instance, to show by 
an example something of what the scope and 
method of this inquiry and advisement will pre- 
sumably be like, it may be remarked that under 
the new order the existing competitive commercial 
traffic engaged in the distribution of goods to con- 
sumers will presumably fall away, in the main, 
for want of a commercial incentive. It is well 
known, in a general way, that the present organiza- 
tion of this traffic, by wholesale and retail mer- 
chandising, involves a very large and very costly 
duplication of work, equipment, stock, and per- 
sonnel, several hundred per cent more than 
would be required by an economically efficient man- 
agement of the traffic on a reasonable plan. In 
looking for a way out of the present extremely 
wasteful merchandising traffic, and in working out 
organization tables for an equitable and efficient 
distribution of goods to consumers, the experts in 
the case will, it is believed, be greatly helped out 
by detailed information on such existing organiza- 
tions as, e.g., the distributing system of the Chicago 
Packers, the chain stores, and the mail-order 
houses. These are commercial organizations, of 
course, and as such they are managed with a view 
to the commercial gain of their owners and man- 
agers; but they are at the same time designed to 
avoid the ordinary wastes of the ordinary retail 
distribution, for the benefit of their absentee own- 
ers. There are not a few object-lessons of economy 
of this practical character to be found among the 
Vested Interests; so much so that the economies 
which result from them are among the valuable 
capitalized assets of these business concerns. 

This contemplated inquiry will, of course, also 
be useful in the way of publicity; to show, con- 
cretely and convincingly, what are the inherent de- 
fects of the present businesslike control of industry, 
why these defects are inseparable from a business- 
like control under existing circumstances, and 
what may fairly be expected of an industrial man- 
agement which takes no account of absentee owner- 
ship. The ways and means of publicity to be em- 
ployed is a question that plainly cannot profitably 



be discussed beforehand, so long as the whole ques- 
tion of the contemplated inquiry itself has little 
more than a speculative interest; and much the same 
will have to be said as to the scope and detail of 
the inquiry, which will have to be determined in 
great part by the interest and qualifications of the 
men who are to carry it on. Nothing but provision- 
al generalities could at all confidently be sketched 
into its program until the work is in hand. 

The contemplated eventual shift to a new and 
more practicable system of industrial production 
and distribution has been here spoken of as a 
"revolutionary overturn" of the established order. 
This flagitious form of words is here used chiefly 
because the Guardians of the established order are 
plainly apprehensive of something sinister that can 
be called by no gentlei 1 name, rather than with the 
intention of suggesting that extreme and subversive 
measures alone can now save the life of the under- 
lying population from the increasingly disservice- 
able rule of the Vested Interests. The move which 
is here discussed in a speculative way under this 
sinister form of words, as a contingency to be 
guarded against by fair means and foul, need, in 
effect, be nothing spectacular; assuredly it need 
involve no clash of arms or fluttering of banners, 
unless, as is beginning to seem likely, the Guardians 
of the old order should find that sort of thing ex- 
pedient. In its elements, the move will be of the 
simplest and most matter-of-fact character; al- 
though there will doubtless be many intricate ad- 
justments to be made in detail. In principle, all 
that is necessarily involved is a disallowance of 
absentee ownership ; that is to say, the disestablish- 
ment of an institution which has, in the course of 
time and change, proved to be noxious to the com- 
mon good. The rest will follow quite simply from 
the cancelment of this outworn and footless vested 
right. 

By absentee ownership, as the term applies in 
this connection, is here to be understood the owner- 
ship of an industrially useful article by any person 
or persons who are not habitually employed in the 
industrial use of it. In this connection, office work 
of a commercial nature is not rated as industrial 
employment. A corollary of some breadth follows 
immediately, although it is so obvious an implica- 
tion of the main proposition that it should scarcely 
need explicit statement: An owner who is employed 
in the industrial use of a given parcel of property 
owned by him, will still be an "absentee owner," 
within the meaning of the term, in case he is not 
the only person habitually employed in its use. A 
further corollary follows, perhaps less obvious at 
first sight, but no less convincing on closer atten- 



378 



THE DIAL 



November 1 



tion to the sense of the terms employed: Collective 
ownership, of the corporate form, that is to say 
ownership by a collectivity instituted ad hoc, also 
falls away as being unavoidably absentee owner- 
ship, within the meaning of the term. It will be 
noted that all this does not touch joint ownership 
of property held in undivided interest by a house- 
hold group and made use of by the members of the 
household indiscriminately. It is only in so far 
as the household is possessed of useful property 
not made use of by its members, or not made use 
of without hired help, that its ownership of such 
property falls within the meaning of the term, ab- 
sentee ownership. To be sufficiently explicit; it 
may be added that the cancelment of absentee own- 
ership as here understood will apply indiscrimin- 
ately to all industrially useful objects, whether 
realty or personalty, whether natural resources, 
equipment, banking capital, or wrought goods in 
stock. 

As an immediate consequence of this cancelment 
of absentee ownership it should seem to be alto- 
gether probable that industrially useful articles 
will presently cease to be used for purposes of 
ownership, that is to say for purposes of private 
gain; although there might be no administrative 
interference with such use. Under the existing 
state of the industrial arts, neither the natural re- 
sources drawn on for power and materials nor 
the equipment employed in the great and con- 
trolling industries are of a nature to lend them- 
selves to any other than absentee ownership; 
and these industries control the situation, so 
that private enterprise for gain on a small 
scale would scarcely find a suitable market. 
At the same time the inducement to private ac- 
cumulation of wealth at the cost of the community 
would virtually fall away, inasmuch as the induce- 
ment to such accumulation now is in nearly all 
cases an ambition to come in for something in the 
way of absentee ownership. In effect, other incen- 
tives are a negligible quantity. Evidently, the 
secondary effects of such cancelment will go far, 
in more than one direction, but evidently, too, there 
could be little profit in endeavoring to follow up 
these ulterior contingencies in extended specula- 
tions here. 

As to the formalities, of a legal complexion, that 
would be involved in such a disallowance of absen- 
tee ownership, they need also be neither large nor 
intricate; at least not in their main incidence. It 
will in all probability take the shape of a cancel- 
ment of all corporation securities, as an initial 
move. Articles of partnership, evidences of debt, 
asd other legal instruments which now give title 



to property not in hand or not in use by the owner, 
will be voided by the same act. In all probability 
this will be sufficient for the purpose. 

This act of disallowance may be called subversive 
and revolutionary; but while there is no intention 
here to offer anything in the way of exculpation, 
it is necessary to an objective appraisal of the con- 
templated move to note that the effect of such dis- 
allowance would be subversive or revolutionary 
only in a figurative sense of the words. It would 
all of it neither subvert nor derange any substantial 
mechanical contrivance or relation, nor need it ma- 
terially disturb the relations, either as workman or 
as consumer of goods and services, of any appre- 
ciable number of persons now engaged in produc- 
tive industry. In fact, the disallowance will touch 
nothing more substantial than a legal make-believe. 
This would, of course, be serious enough in its 
consequences to those classes called the kept 
classes whose livelihood hangs on the mainten- 
ance of this legal make-believe. So, likewise, it 
would vacate the occupation of the "middleman," 
which likewise turns on the maintenance of this 
legal make-believe; which gives "title" to that to 
which one stands in no material relation. 

Doubtless, hardship will follow thick and fast, 
among those classes who are least inured to priva- 
tion; and doubtless all men will agree that it is a 
great pity. But this evil is, after all, a side issue, 
as regards the present argument, which has to do 
with nothing else than the practicability of the 
scheme. So it is necessary to note that, however 
detrimental to the special interests of the absentee 
owners this move may be, yet it will not in any 
degree derange or diminish those material facts 
that constitute the ways and means of productive 
industry; nor will it in any degree enfeeble or 
mutilate that joint stock of technical knowledge 
and practice that constitutes the intellectual work- 
ing force of the industrial system. It does not di- 
rectly touch the material facts of industry, for bet- 
ter or worse. In this sense it is a completely idle 
matter, in its immediate incidence, whatever its 
secondary consequences may be believed to be. 

But there is no doubt that a proposal to disallow 
absentee ownership will shock the moral sensi- 
bilities of many persons; more particularly the 
sensibilities of the absentee owners. To avoid the 
appearance of willful neglect, therefore, it is neces- 
sary to speak also of the "moral aspect." There 
is no intention here to argue the moral merits of 
this contemplated disallowance of absentee owner- 
ship; or to argue for or against such a move, on 
moral or other grounds. Absentee ownership is 
legally sound today. Indeed, as is well known, the 



1919 



THE DIAL 



379 



Constitution includes a clause which specially safe- 
guards its security. If, and when, the law is chang- 
ed, in this respect, what so is legal today will of 
course cease to be legal. There is, in fact, not 
much more to be said about it; except that, in the 
last resort, the economic moralities wait on the 
economic necessities. The economic-moral sense 
of the American community today runs unequivo- 
cally to the effect that absentee ownership is funda- 
mentally and eternally right and good; and it should 
seem reasonable to believe that it will continue to 
run to that effect for some time yet. 

There has lately been some irritation and fault- 
finding with what is called "profiteering" and there 
may be more or less uneasy discontent with what 
is felt to be an unduly disproportionate inequality 
in the present distribution of income; but appre- 
hensive persons should not lose sight of the main 
fact that absentee ownership after all is the idol of 
every true American heart. It is the substance of 
things hoped for and the reality of things not seen. 
To achieve (or to inherit) a competency, that is to 
say to accumulate such wealth as will assure a 
"decent" livelihood in industrial absentia, is the 
universal, and universally laudable, ambition of 
all who have reached years of discretion; but it all 
means the same thing to get something for noth- 
ing, at any cost. Similarly universal is the awe- 
struck deference with which the larger absentee 
owners are looked up to for guidance and example. 
These substantial citizens are the ones who have 
"made good," in the popular apprehension. They 
are the great and good men whose lives "all remind 
us we can make our lives sublime, etc." 

This commercialized frame of mind is a sturdy 
outgrowth of many generations of consistent train- 
ing in the pursuit of the main chance; it is second 
nature, and there need be no fear that it will allow 
the Americans to see workday facts in any other than 
its own perspective, just yet. The most tenacious 
factor in any civilization is a settled popular 
frame of mind, and to this abiding American frame 
of mind absentee ownership is the controlling cen- 
ter of all the economic realties. 

So, having made plain that all this argument on 
a practicable overturn of the established order has 
none but a speculative interest, the argument can 
go on to consider what will be the nature of the 
initial move of overturn which is to break with the 
old order of absentee ownership and set up a regime 
of workmanship governed by the country's tech- 
nicians. 

As has already been called to mind, repeatedly, 
the effective management of the industrial system 
at large is already in the hands of the technicians, 



so far as regards the work actually done; but it is 
all under the control of the Vested Interests, repre- 
senting absentee owners, so far as regards its failure 
to work. And the failure is, quite reasonably, 
attracting much attention lately. In this two-cleft, 
or bi-cameral, administration of industry, the tech- 
nicians may be said to represent the community at 
large in its industrial capacity, or in other words 
the industrial system as a going concern; whereas 
the business men speak for the commercial interest 
of the absentee owners, as a body which holds the 
industrial community in usufruct. It is the part 
of the technicians, between them, to know the 
country's available resources, in mechanical power, 
and equipment; to know and put in practice the 
joint stock of technological knowledge which is 
indispensable to industrial production; as well as 
to know and take care of the community's habitual 
need and use of consumable goods. They are, in 
effect, the general staff of production engineers, 
under whose surveillance the required output of 
goods and services is produced and distributed to 
the consumers. Whereas it is the part of the busi- 
ness men to know what rate and volume of pro- 
duction and distribution will best serve the com- 
mercial interest of the absentee owners, and to put 
this commercial knowledge in practice by nicely 
limiting production and distribution of the output 
to such a rate and volume as their commercial 
traffic will bear that is to say, what will yield the 
largest net income to the absentee owners in terms 
of price. In this work of sagaciously retarding 
industry the captains of industry necessarily work 
at cross purposes, among themselves, since the traf- 
fic is of a competitive nature. 

Accordingly, in this two-cleft arrangement of 
administrative functions, it is the duty of the 
technicians to plan the work and to carry it on; and 
it is the duty of the captains of industry to feee that 
the work will benefit none but the captains and 
their associated absentee owners, and that it is not 
pushed beyond the salutary minimum which their 
commercial traffic will bear. In all that concerns 
the planning and execution of the work done,* the 
technicians necessarily take the initiative and exer- 
cise the necessary creative surveillance and direc- 
tion ; that being what they, and they alone, are good 
for; whereas the businesslike deputies of the ab- 
sentee owners sagaciously exercise a running veto 
power over the technicians and their productive in- 
dustry. They are able effectually to exercise this 
commercially sagacious veto power by the fact that 
the technicians are, in effect, their employes, hired 
to do their bidding and fired if they do not; and 
perhaps no less by this other fact, that the techni- 
cians have hitherto been working piecemeal, as

scattered individuals under their master's eye; they 
have hitherto not drawn together on their own 
ground and taken counsel together as a general 
staff of industry, to determine what had best be 
done and what not. So that they have hitherto 
figured in the conduct of the country's industrial 
enterprise only as a technological extension of the 
business men's grasp on the commercial main 
chance. 

Yet, immediately and unremittingly, the tech- 
nicians and their advice and surveillance are es- 
sential to any work whatever in those great primary 
industries on which the country's productive sys- 
tems turns, and which set the pace for all the rest. 
And it is obvious that so soon as they shall draw 
together, in a reasonably inclusive way, and take 
common counsel as to what had best be done, they 
are in a position to say what work shall be done 
and to fix the terms on which it is to be done. In 
.short, so far as regards the technical requirements 
of the case, the situation is ready for a self-selected, 
but inclusive, Soviet of technicians to take over 
the economic affairs qf the country and to allow 
and disallow what they may agree on; provided al- 
ways that they live within the requirements of that 
state of the industrial arts whose keepers they are, 
and provided that their pretensions continue to have 
the support of the industrial rank and file; which 
comes near saying that their Soviet must consist- 
ently and effectually take care of the material wel- 
fare of the underlying population. 

Now, this revolutionary posture of the present 
state of the industrial arts may be undesirable, in 
some respects, but there is nothing to be gained by 
denying the fact. So soon but only so soon as 
the engineers draw together, take common counsel, 
work out a plan of action, and decide to disallow 
absentee ownership out of hand, that move will 
have been made. The obvious and simple means 
of doing it is a conscientious withdrawal of efficien- 
cy; that is to say the general strike, to include so 
much of the country's staff of technicians as will 
suffice to incapacitate the industrial system at large 
by their withdrawal, for such time as may be re- 
quired to enforce their argument. 

In its elements, the project is simple and obvious, 
but its working out will require much painstaking 
preparation, much more than appears on the face 
of this bald statement; for it also follows from the 
present state of the industrial arts and from the 
character of the industrial system in which modern 
technology works out, that even a transient failure 
to make good in the conduct of productive indus- 
try will result in a precipitate collapse of the en- 
terprise. 

By themselves alone, the technicians can, in a 



few weeks, effectually incapacitate the country's 
productive industry sufficiently for the purpose. No 
one who will dispassionately consider the technical 
character of this industrial system will fail to rec- 
ognize that fact. But so long as they have not, at 
least, the tolerant consent of the population at large, 
backed by the aggressive support of the trained 
working force engaged in transportation and in 
the greater primary industries, they will be sub- 
stantially helpless to set up a practicable working 
organization on the new footing; which is the same 
as saying that they will in that case accomplish 
nothing more to the purpose than a transient period 
of hardship and dissension. 

Accordingly, if it be presumed that the produc- 
tion engineers are of a mind to play their part, 
there will be at least two main lines of subsidiary 
preparation to be taken care of before any overt 
move can reasonably be undertaken: (a) An ex- 
tensive campaign of inquiry and publicity, such as 
will bring the underlying population to a reason- 
able understanding of what it is all about; and 
(b) the working-out of a common understanding 
and a solidarity of sentiment between the techni- 
cians and the working force engaged in transporta- 
tion and in the greater underlying industries of the 
system: to which is to be added as being nearly 
indispensable from the outset, an active adherence 
to this plan on the part of the trained workmen in 
the great generality of the mechanical industries. 
Until these prerequisites are taken care of, any 
project for the overturn of the established order of 
absentee ownership will be nugatory. 

By way of conclusion it may be recalled again 
that, just yet, the production engineers are a scat- 
tering lot of fairly contented subalterns, working 
piecemeal under orders from the deputies of the 
absentee owners; the working force of the great 
mechanical industries, including transportation, are 
still nearly out of touch and out of sympathy with 
the technical men, and are bound in rival trade 
organizations whose sole and self-seeking interest 
converges on the full dinner-pail ; while the under- 
lying population are as nearly uninformed on the 
state of things as the. Guardians of the Vested In- 
terests, including the commercialized newspapers, 
can manage to keep them, and they are consequently 
still in a frame of mind to tolerate no substantial 
abatement of absentee ownership; and the consti- 
tuted authorities are competently occupied with 
maintaining the status quo There is nothing in the 
situation that should reasonably flutter the sensi- 
bilities of the Guardians or of that massive body 
of well-to-do citizens who make up the rank and 
file of absentee owners, just yet.

The Old Order and the New 



Jr ERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE 

peacemakers of Paris is a new method of making 
war. Throughout the century and a half that pre- 
ceded the recent conflict, the framers of constitu- 
tions were busy with the imposition of legislative 
checks upon the diplomatic and war-making powers 
of national executives. These constitutionalists, no 
less than President Wilson, were the enemies of 
secret diplomacy and of "every arbitrary power any- 
where than can separately, secretly, and of its single 
choice disturb the peace of the world." Although 
the restrictions imposed in these years of laborious 
reform were by no means rigorous, yet foreign af- 
fairs, and matters of war and peace in particular, 
did come to fall somewhat under the influence of 
public opinion and legislative debate, and in cer- 
tain instances even became in a measure subject 
to legislative control. The influence of public opin- 
ion in these matters actually became so strong that 
any executive who attempted to organize a nation 
for war felt compelled to provide the people with 
war aims that became more and more idealistic as 
the burden of the war itself became more and more 
difficut to bear. Slight as these restrictions are, 
they still carry us a step in advance of the time 
when the military force of the nation, like its other 
powers, was at the disposition of a wholly irre- 
sponsible executive. This much then had been ac- 
complished before the dawn of Armistice Day. 
But from the days of the Bolshevist coup d' etat 
in Petrograd it had been apparent to the more or 
less responsible executives of the Allied nations that 
victory over Germany would leave a more insidious 
enemy still undefeated an enemy not of the Allied 
nations but of their privileged classes. The diplo- 
mats dared not ask the legislatures and the peoples 
to essay another passage at arms. In fact it had 
become necessary to invent a type of warfare that 
could be entered upon and conducted by executives, 
without legislative sanction, without the Conscrip- 
tion of soldiers, without money grants or heavy 
taxation or the wide sale of government securities 
in short, without the support of the manhood 
and money, of the constitutional governments of 
the Allied countries. Necessity spawned its inven- 
tion the "peaceful blockade." Even when the 
peoples of the Allied countries were most ardent in 
their desire to crush the Central Powers, the block- 
ade was regarded in some quarters as an inhuman 
method of warfare. But now the diplomatic agents 
of France and England, with the compliance of our 
own State Department, have turned this weapon 



against a land with which we are at peace. More 
than this, the Supreme Council is attempting to 
persuade or intimidate the executives of neutral 
governments into joining the new alliance, and 
has threatened Germany with economic strangula- 
tion, at the hands of the Reparations Commission, 
if she refuses to become a party to this crime. If 
the Senate of the United States and the parliaments 
of the countries addressed by the Council are con- 
cerned for the safety of representative government, 
let them take immediately from the diplomats the 
power that enables them, "separately, secretly, and 
of their single choice," to declare a war of exterm- 
ination against any nation that has displeased them. 



J_HE GERMAN CONSTITUTION, NOW PUBLISHED IN 
complete translation, has been praised as a progres- 
sive document. It is so difficult to find anything in 
Central Europe today execept anemic mothers and 
tuberculous children that it is hard to withhold 
recognition of life and movement where it is even 
faintly discernible. But the German Constitution 
is not the place to look for it. Undoubtedly it is 
a modern constitution in the sense that it was made 
yesterday: it is not modern however in the sense 
that it embodies the best political practice adduced 
from criticism of the actual constitution of the Unit- 
ed States or the constitutional laws of France. Far 
from being progressive, the German Constitution is 
one of the most static of state documents. Instead 
of providing simply a mechanism for formulating 
policies and enacting legislation, and an additional 
mechanism for replacing its own machinery as soon 
as it becomes obsolete, the Constitution lays down 
specifically the line of legislation which must, ac- 
cording to organic mandate, be followed. Obvi- 
ously no constitution can escape the limitations of 
its period: what is wrong with the German Consti- 
tution is that it attempts to project its limitations 
into the future. The Germans have recognized and 
thoroughly provided in their basic law for every 
phase of existing society. Unfortunately the very 
act of definition will crystallize the forms of present 
day society into a more or less rigid mold, and the 
inflexibility of the written word is bound to hinder 
the task of modifying the mold sufficiently to pro- 
vide for the succeeding stage of civilization. The 
very fact that the German Constitution reflects faith- 
fully the facts and ideals of present day Germany 
is its prime defect. For the future will show a dif- 
ferent image, and the present mirror will distort it.

THE BREAKDOWN OF STATESMANSHIP DURING THE 

past year has had some of the terrific, impersonal 
grandeur of an earthquake. The catastrophic war 
which nobody could prevent had its fitting sequel 
in the catastrophic peace which nobody dared to im- 
prove. Those of us who are committed to the im- 
passive role of spectators have been a little slow in 
sensing the play of these august events upon the 
personalities chiefly concerned in them. The states- 
men and labor leaders themselves may have been 
slow in realizing their ambiguous positions. It 
seems that they have been the victims of a dilemma 
which nothing short of a physical breakdown could 
make manifest. In this sense the plight of President 
Wilson, on the assumption that it is a functional as 
well as an organic disturbance, has a universal 
significance. It throws perhaps a light upon the 
illnesses of Colonel House and Samuel Gompers, 
and by reflection upon the amazing health of Mr. 
Lloyd George. It is with no failing of due 
respect that we select the case of the President 
as exemplary. A recapitulation of his history 
during the past two years discloses evidence of a 
basic failure of adjustment which was bound to 
disclose itself eventually in either a mental or 
a physical reaction. His was the difficulty of the 
idealist who had not learned to master his materials, 
and who in the course of prosecuting a vigorous 
bellicose action was able to keep his ideal self 
only by keeping it apart. As a result two Mr. Wil- 
sons gradually came into existence, and as they de- 
veloped there arose a dissociation between the 
world of General Staffs, diplomats, and espionage 
organizations in which Mr. Wilson had to work, 
and that private world of hope, faith, and infinite 
charity into which he retired to think. So far from 
letting the war change the disciple of pacifism into 
the legionary of Mars, as in Shaw's fable of Ferro- 
vius in Androcles and the Lion, Mr. Wilson per- 
fected himself in each of the parts separately, and 
in each of them created an apparently firm and con- 
sistent character. The two Mr. Wilsons went to 
Paris: one bowing to the crowds, and the other 
dining with the diplomats. One made speeches 
against secret diplomacy, the use of arbitrary power, 
and the disregard of faith and humanity in dealing 
with those whose sins increased the difficulty of dis- 
pensing justice. The other was the "realist" Mr. 
Wilson who sat in secret conferences, bartered 
friendly peoples' territories for a scrap of paper, 
ignored his pledges both to friend and enemy, and 
transformed the war to make the world safe for 
democracy into a peace to make the world profit- 
able for secret treaties. The idealist Mr. Wilson 
returned from Paris to campaign with sabbatical 
seriousness for the League and Treaty that the prac- 
tical Mr. Wilson had all too astutely assisted in 
writing. Between these two characters was a sharply 
drawn conflict. On a less urgent and less important 

occasion Mr. Wilson might have found some simple 
f 



defense mechanism, such as the jest or the trans- 
fered reproach, to reconcile these opposites in a 
higher synthesis. But by the time his work was 
challenged in America these defenses had been 
insidiously weakened: and the revelations of Lan- 
sing, Bullitt, and Colcord, backed by the criticisms 
of Knox, Borah, and Johnson, doubtless jolted to 
the foundations the hitherto self sufficient com- 
placencies and assurances. The practical Mr. Wil- 
son found it more and more difficult to appeal to 
the idealist for moral sustenance. And at length 
the contest between the two personalities could not 
be concealed: it was a public spectacle. For this 
reason it had either openly to be proclaimed or 
transferred to other grounds. An integrated 
character would have renounced in humiliation the 
League, the Treaty, and all their works, or it would 
have blown away the nauseous vapors of justice, 
humanity, and fair play that enveloped its declara- 
tions, and have proclaimed the folly of its hopes 
and the futility of its promises. Unfortunately 
the President could not decide any better than Mr. 
Gompers whether he was for the old world that 
had not yet broken up or the new one that was 
yet to be born. The realist and the idealist were 
each too mature and resolute to submit to the 
domination of the other. The President's lament- 
able illness is possibly a sign that neither of them 
will give in, and that the difference is being settled, 
not by the simple mechanism of rationalization 
and compromornise, but by the deeper and more 
ultimate mechanism of disease. It is to be regretted 
that Mr. Wilson has not had the sanguine flexibility 
of Mr. Lloyd George; for the English Premier has 
trimphantly demonstrated how stable the constitu- 
tion and mental equipment of a statesman may 
remain as long as he does not work deliberately 
against an automatic adjustment by clinging to a 
cumbersome body of principles and moral con- 
victions. If government is to be effected by majori- 
ties the statesman who leads his constituents by fol- 
lowing the popular nose is the ideal statesman. 
The idealist, who can neither master his course of 
action nor warp his principles, will find that in the 
art of government all* is vanity and vexation of 
spirit and tiiat finally the brain lags and the 
flesh itself is as grass.

Notes on New Books 

THE HAPPY END. By Joseph Hergesheimer. 
315 pages. Knopf. 

In these studies Hergesheimer discloses a flexibil- 
ity seldom realized in the short-story. Where most 
writers are content to give this narrative form a 
circumscribed burden of emotion circumscribed, 
that is, in direction though not in intensity Herge- 
sheimer shows it capable of as many facets as a 
finely cut jewel each one a contribution to an 
underlying unity. It is this characteristic of the 
stories in The Happy End which clothes them with 
the seeming richness and suggested complexity of 
full-length novels. Hergesheimer develops his 
stories with such vivifying technique that they be- 
come surcharged, and the reader is made tinglingly 
conscious of a reserve voltage, constantly generated 
and yet always controlled. There is scant consid- 
eration for action apart from conflict in these tales ; 
the theme to which he returns again and again is 
that of a character saddled with an obligation, hew- 
ing a pathway through the brambles of existence. 
Hergesheimer's men and women are pivoted upon 
destiny not piloted to a destination: the dedica- 
tion to the volume, in which he affirms his responsi- 
bility to his grocer, evidently was composed with 
his tongue in his cheek. The seven stories which 
comprise this book touch life at many angles. 
There is, in Rosemary Roselle, a fine study of op- 
posing temperaments, thrown against a Civil War 
background. Bread, a story of exquisite artistry, 
infuees a fresh significance into the war as an ele- 
ment of fiction. Each tale has some peculiar grace, 
and a quickening appeal to the imagination. The 
collection is a real addition to the work of a writer 
whose utterances grow increasingly significant. 

A SERVANT OF REALITY. By Phyllis Bottome. 
454 pages. Century. 

Those whose function it is to commit literature 
to the card index may have no space in the cata- 
logue for a type of novel bearing the designation, 
"light tragedy," and yet there is occasional need 
for just this classification. It seems to us that Miss 
Bottome's newest story is of that type, for it clothes 
an essentially tragic theme in the gay garments of 
a style which is continually sparkling, and not in- 
frequently heady with epigram. We suspect that 
the technique of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Do- 
rian Gray was not far remote from the conscious- 
ness of this novelist in the fashioning of the ma- 
terials of A Servant of Reality. The form is a 
dangerous one to handle, for only a hair line spa- 
rates it from a breach of esthetic good taste, but 
it may be set down to the credit of Miss Bottome 
that at no point does the mood clash with method. 
It is a daring thing, for example, right at the tragic 
peak of the story, to drop back into the deft, slightly 



ironic, tone of the earlier part of the book, but the 
transition is accomplished in a manner to heighten 
rather than to jeopardize the effect. Moreover, A 
Servant of Reality is one of those rare novels into 
which the war has been fused not injected. The 
war explains the emotions of the central characters, 
without explaining them out of existence. It is pos- 
sible to understand the actions of the overwrought 
surgeon, returning from two years in a German 
prison camp, and his sudden absorption in the 
light, frivolous, but basically tragic figure of the 
story's heroine. These people are made real, not 
puppets of military necessity. 

Miss Bottome seems to have an instinctive sense 
of situation. In the handling of minor incidents 
there is no overcrowding, no straining for a desired 
effect. The incidents unfold naturally, and then are 
re-absorbed in the main current of the narrative. 
Minor characters some of them real creations are 
so skilfully employed as to contribute measurably 
to the impression of artistic totality which the book 
leaves. The dialogue is just remote enough from 
reality to give it fragrance; it is too sparkling to be 
spontaneous, but the loss in illusion is compensated 
for by the polish. After all, what Wells calls "the 
splash and glitter" of a genuine prose style has its 
place in novel writing, despite the preponderance 
of those who blunder through without it. 

THE SECRETS OF ANIMAL LIFE. By J. Arthur 
Thomson. 325 pages. Holt. 

Professor Thomson always suggests more than 
he says, and the charm of his style appears no- 
where better than in these forty papers, collected 
from a series that appeared over several years in 
The New Statesman. There is nothing since Ray 
Lankester's Easy Chair that is so characteristic of 
the modern scientific "natural history," in distinc- 
tion from the older writing about the mysteries of 
living things. There is the appreciation of the mys- 
teries joined to a thorough familiarity with the 
scientific attitude as well as with the scientific rev- 
elations of our own tune. Most of the chapters are 
really review articles on topics suggested by scien- 
tific monographs that have appeared in the course 
of the past ten years, many of them from American 
laboratories. They summarize significant facts, 
present outstanding problems, and indicate leading 
hypotheses and lines of approach to the solutions, 
and frequently the practical bearings or applica- 
tions. Four main groups of topics are discussed 
the adaptation of the individual animal to his sur- 
roundings, the interrelations of organisms, develop- 
ment and behavior, and problems of evolution and 
heredity. 'Taken together these collected papers 
give an excellent survey of the present outlook in 
the biological sciences, of especial value to the lay- 
man and to the young student who has not yet ori- 
ented himself in the bewildering maze of technical 
literature.

THE BOOK OF A NATURALIST. W. H. Hudson. 
360 pages. Doran. 

In The Book of a Naturalist Mr. Hudson sur- 
rounds some of the familiar animals of Great Brit- 
ain with a volume of humane and edifying gossip, 
given out in a spirit of admirably benevolent in- 
telligence. The book glows with that certain gen- 
tlemanly provincialism that doth hedge about a 
certified Briton. The tales, or anecdotes, are told 
with a mannerly reserve, not to say forbearance, 
which however does not go the length of anywise 
hampering that abundant run of graceful speech 
which makes their substance. There is, now and 
again, a remote promise of whimsicality, and at 
times also an apparently advised approach to hu- 
mor. And with all, it is pleasant reading for a 
dull afternoon, and it shows, or hints at, a much 
larger and more intimate acquaintance among the 
commonplace British fauna than the writer has 
thought best to disclose. A person not familiar 
with Mr. Hudson's earlier and more artful tales 
from lower latitudes might even find that this 
book lives up to the promise of its title page. 

FIELDS OF VICTORY. By Mrs. Humphry 
Ward. 274 pages. Scribner. 
MY "LITTLE BIT." By Marie Corelli. 318 
pages. Doran. 

If it were wise or even discreet to attempt a 
facile classification of all the war books from non- 
combatant pens, we suspect that the whole harvest 
might be garnered into two sheaves one to be la- 
beled The War and the World, the other The War 
and I. According to the temperament of the 
writer, all the volumes tend to drift one way or the 
other; their aura is either international or per- 
sonal. We find some carrying a flavor of both, of 
course; but in the main, the reaction is fairly defi- 
nite in one direction. These opposed channels are 
rather strikingly emphasized in two late comers to 
the martial shelf Fields of Victory and My 
Little Bit. It is perhaps characteristic that Mrs. 
Ward's book, being the third which she has writ- 
ten dealing with England's part in the war, should 
be gleaned from sources of high command, and 
should subtly convey the impression of rubbing 
shoulders with those personages who held the des- 
tinies of armies like chessmen on a board. It is 
equally characteristic that Miss Corelli, eddying 
about in little gusts of controversy in England, 
should appear to be far more hotly in the thick of 
battle than Mrs. Ward, touring the Western front 
with military escort. While Mrs. Ward is weighing 
the comparative value of this or that strategic move, 
and gravely seeking to compute and apportion mili- 
tary honors among the Allied armies, we find Miss 
Corelli lashing herself into sarcastic fury over the 
domestic policy of the Empire regarding food re- 



strictions and hoarding. Mrs. Ward converses with 
generals; Miss Corelli flays the cabinet. Mrs. Ward 
meets President Wilson, in whose "instinctive and 
accomplished choice of words and phrases, some- 
thing reminded me of the talk of George Eliot as 
I heard it fifty years ago." Miss Corelli is accused 
of sugar hoarding and writes saucy parodies "cor- 
dially inscribed" to Sir Thomas Lipton, "the prince 
o' pickles and o' jam." In this instance, it is the 
writer with the international point of view who 
writes the better book. Mrs. Ward's resume of the 
last year of the war is clear-visioned, scholarly, and 
concise. Miss Corelli's contribution is merely a 
scrapbook possibly in more than one sense of the 
word. It became a book by the grace of a clipping 
bureau. 



FOLKLORE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. By Sir 
James George Frazer. 3 Vols., 1706 pages. 
Macmillan. 

These three tomes contain, in a style of un- 
usual lucidity, comparative studies of folklore em- 
bedded in the Old Testament. The justly famed 
author of The Golden Bough has again displayed 
his peculiar genius for exploring the crannies of 
habit and custom in all human races. Such sub- 
jects as The Creation of Man, The Great Flood, 
Cuttings for the Dead, and The Ox that Gored 
come in for comprehensive studies. In each 
case he presents the Biblical material and then 
proceeds to show that the beliefs and practices 
therein revealed are found embedded in world-wide 
traditions. For instance, hundreds of races and 
tribes scattered in Asia, Africa, North and South 
America, and in the Islands of the seas, have flood 
stories in terms indicative of their own environ- 
ment. These studies abundantly demonstrate that 
many of the Biblical customs and traditions are .sur- 
vivals of a stage of barbarism through which Israel 
passed in its journey to a high level of religious 
development; and that Israel, like other civilized 
races, emerged from a savage state similar to that 
in which many present-day backward races still 
linger. The zeal for heaping up illustrative ma- 
terial, however, leads the author so far afield as to 
justify the suspicion that he is more interested in 
folklore per se than in Biblical folklore. This is 
especially in evidence in the study of the Heirship 
of Jacob and Ultimogeniture, wherein he turns 
aside to prove at considerable length that the no- 
tion of jus primae noctis in Europe was not a right 
claimed by the feudal lord or ecclesiastical digni- 
tary. Near the close of the work Dr. Frazer deftly 
indicates what will undoubtedly be the next ad- 
vance in the science of Primitivity, now being 
forced upon us by the rapidly developing science of 
Social Psychology: that is, the study of the emo- 
tional basis of loklore.

It was not so much the death of an individual as a general lowering in the vitality of the nation. America was

Books of the Fortnight 

The Relation of Executive Power to Legislation, by 

Henry Campbell Black (191 pages; Princeton Uni- 
versity Press), examines the increasing subservience 
of the national legislature since 1865 and calls atten- 
tion not merely to the domination of the President 
but to the encroachment of executive departments. It 
is an attempt to do away with the sham of constitu- 
tional equality between the several branches of gov- 
ernment now that the old equilibrium has been upset. 
The author is editor of The Constitutional Review. 

Organized Efforts for the Improvement of Methods 
of Administration in the United States, by Gus- 
tavus A. Wever (391 pages; Appleton). Students of 
public affairs who are willing to detour this elephan- 
tine title will find much valuable material hidden be- 
hind it. Mr. Wever's volume, published under the 
auspices of the Institute for Government Research, 
deals with the history, organization, and activities of 
agencies for governmental research and control, and 
supplies the reader with long bibliographies of the 
material published by these agencies. Review later. 

The Belgian Congo and the Berlin Act, by Arthur 

Berriedale Keith (344 pages; Oxford University 
Press), is concerned chiefly with the political history 
of the Congo and with an analysis of the international 
compact which regulates the government of the Free 
State. The work is elaborately annotated, and the 
Berlin Act and other state papers of importance are 
reprinted in the appendix. Review later. 

League of Nations: Its Principles Examined, Vol. II, 
by Theodore Marburg (149 pages; Macmillan), goes 
into its third edition, "revised after the triumph of 
the Allies," without taking into account the consider- 
able reconstruction of the pure theory of an inter- 
national league necessitated by contact with the sullied 
practices of the Supreme Council. A war book with- 
out a peace background. 

Labor in the Changing World, by R. M. Maclver (229 
pages; Dutton), examines industrial conditions and 
outlooks in an effort to appraise the current programs 
for reconstruction and to formulate at least the mini- 
mum requirements indicated. Review later. 

Approaches Toward Church Unity, edited by New- 
man Smyth and Williston Walker (170 pages; Yale 
University Press), opens with the announcement that 
the end of the war leaves the reunion of the churches 
as the next Christian thing to be done. A World Con- 
ference on Faith and Order is in preparation, and a 
League of Churches may grow out of it. With the 
New State comes now the New Church. 

Have Faith in Massachusetts, by Governor Coolidge 
(224 pages; Houghton Mifflin) addresses, proclama- 
tions, and obiter dicta from 1914 to the Boston Police 
Strike of 1919 will give hope and comfrt only to 
those that believe that the daylight of common experi- 
ence is brightened by the candle of the obvious. 

The Girl and the Job, by Helene Christene Hoerle and 
Florence B. Saltzberg (266 pages; Holt), contributes 
to the literature of vocational guidance a compendious 
but all too brief summary of business opportunities 
for women. The range of topics only partially makes 
up for the sketchiness of the individual description. 
Should not each industry have its own guidebook? 
The present sample may, point to a "job," but it is 
hardly the comprehensive treatment that should open 
up a life's vocation. 



The Health of the Teacher, by William Estabrook 
Chancellor (307 pages; Forbes, Chicago), first dis- 
cusses various aspects of the teacher's physical dis- 
abilities in chapters that are each illustrated by specif- 
ic cases, and goes on to outline the upbuilding meas- 
ures and habits which are indicated. There are of 
course occupational diseases, and while Dr. Chan- 
cellor's positive advice might well apply to any indi- 
vidual, this little treatise does well to remind us 
that there is also room for manuals in occupational 
adjustment. 

Danger Signals for Teachers, by A. E. Winship (204 
pages; Forbes, Chicago), is a series of vigorous, hor- 
tatory, up-to-date platitudes addressed to teachers by 
the editor of the Journal of Education. In an organi- 
zation whose rolling stock of ideas is so light the 
costliness of acquiring this signal system need not 
alarm the intellectually timid teacher. 

Yale Talks, by Charles Reynolds Brown (156 pages; Yale 
University Press), is subdued sermonizing, carrying a 
burden of uplift neither greater nor less than one ex- 
pects in a book of that sort. The group of "talks" is 
not indigenous to Yale; it might just as accurately 
be called What Every Dean Says. 

My Generation, by William Jewett Tucker (464 pages; 
Houghton Mifflin), is a documentation not merely of 
post-Darwinian America but of post-Emersonian New 
England. Following the career of the author from 
his New York pastorate through his Andever period 
to his Presidency of Dartmouth, one arrives at Ran- 
dolph Bourne's conclusion that there is something 
wrong with a civilization that "could apparently find 
no other use for such a mind than to put it for the 
best years of its life into the routine of a New England 
college." My Generation might in a more bitter mood 
be called Our Unregeneration. Review later. 

The Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle, edited by 
Reginald C. McGrane (359 pages; Houghton Mifflin), 
deals with national affairs from 1807 to 1844. While 
many of the letters concern themselves with the 
United States Bank, of which Biddle was Director and 
President, there are interesting sidelights in letters 
to Clay and Webster on the conditions leading up to 
the Mexican War. 

Impressions of Theodore Roosevelt, by Lawrence F. 
Abbott (315 pages ; Doubleday, Page) , does no more 
than add to a long list of photographs the occasional 
literary snapshots which the author, through his as- 
sociation with The Outlook, was able to make. Neither 
the lighting nor the composition have that excellence 
which might place the present work above its equally 
amateur competitors. 

The Poet of Science and Other Addresses by Wil- 
liam North Rice (225 pages; Abingdon Press), would 
have been a dangerously liberal collection in 1870. 
At present its only appeal will be to those who think 
that the conflict between religion and science is suffi- 
ciently genuine to merit the intercession of a Wesleyan 
geologist. 

The Book of a Naturalist, by W. H. Hudson (360 
pages; Doran), is reviewed on page 384. 

Streamer aft, by Dr. 'George Parker Holden (264 pages; 
Stewart & Kidd; Cincinnati), is so compact and read- 
able that it should do more than serve the novice; it 
should make converts. It treats such topics as the 
care of the rod, the art of casting, the habits of trout, 
and the use of flies.

Homing With the Birds, by Gene Stratton-Porter (381 
pages; Dpubleday, Page), is a narrative of field work 
based on a "lifetime of personal contact with the 
birds." The author's method of observation has been 
to "insinuate herself" into positions of "close inti- 
macy," and in order to do this she has faced "tramps, 
vicious domestic animals, and cross dogs," and the 
"torture of chills, fever, and delirium from incipient 
sunstroke." There are numerous illustrations and 
much interesting material; but one wishes that Mrs. 
Porter were more the naturalist and less the martyr. 

The Secrets of Animal Life, by J. Arthur Thomson (324 
pages; Holt), is reviewed on page 383. 

Reynard the Fox, or The Ghost Heath Run, by John 
Masefield (166 pages, Macmillan), is reviewed on 
page 371. 

The Army Behind the Army, by Major E. Alexander 
Powell (469 pages; Scribner), is not very accurately 
captioned. Services like the Ordnance Department 
and the Quartermaster Corps, which busied themselves 
with the preparation of material for the use of the 
artillery and the infantry, are grouped with other 
services, like the Engineers, the Signal Corps, and the 
Air Service, which manufactured their own appliances 
and used them too oftener in front of the army than 
"behind" it. 

Books in the War, by Theodore Wesley Koch (388 
pages; H ought on Miffiin), describes the work of the 
American Library Association in maintaining, through 
camp and hospital libraries, the soldier's tenuous con- 
nection with civilization. Many youthful "veterans" 
will vouch for it that the Association exhibited less 
of the Lady Bountiful spirit, and did more solid work, 
than many other organizations better known to fame. 

Gun Fodder, by Major A. Hamilton Gibbs (313 pages; 
Little, Brown; Boston), is fraternally introduced as 
a good book by a good soldier by Philip Gibbs, war 
correspondent and senior brother of the author. The 
volume does in fact recount in an extraordinarily 
pleasing manner the sort of tale that has become 
familiar through a thousand repetitions in personal 
narratives of the war. 

War in the Garden of Eden, by Captain Kermit Roose- 
velt (253 pages; Scribner), is an account of personal 
experiences in the campaigns that annexed the Gar- 
den of Eden to John Bull's back yard. 

The Test of Scarlet, by Coningsby Dawson (313 pages; 
Lane) , is a readable war story that "follows through" 
to Armistice Day, when Paris and London went mad, 
while the marching men whose triumph was being so 
ecstatically celebrated "pulled in to the side of the 
road, felt cold, and limped back to the nearest town 
in search of billets." 

The House of Courage, by Mrs. Victor Rickard (394 
pages; Dodd, Mead), is mainly about the experiences 
of a young Irish officer held a prisoner in Germany 
during the early days of the war. A novel garnished 
with the familiar post-war anamorphosis of German 
character. 

When I Come Back, by Henry Sydnor Harrison (69 
pages; Houghton Mifflin), describes the work of the 
unassuming man, over-age for compulsory service, 
whose war ambition it was "to become an indistin- 
guishable unit in the fighting army" an ambition 
gratified at last, and altogether, in the flame of a 
German shell. 



Square Peggy, by Josephine Daskam Bacon (illustrated, 
340 pages; Appleton). Ten well-to-do girls regarded 
as queer fish by the social swim find themselves and 
their well-to-do mates through situations arising from 
the war. 

The Bishop and Other Stories, by Anton Chekhov (302 
pages; Macmillan), is the seventh volume in Con- 
stance Garnett's complete translation of the Russian 
author. Previous volumes were reviewed by Louis S. 
Friedland in THE DIAL for January 3, 1918. This vol- 
ume will be reviewed soon. 

A Tarpaulin Muster, by John Masefield (217 pages; 
Dodd, Mead), is reviewed on page 371. 

The Happy End, by Joseph Hergesheimer (315 pages; 
Knopf), is reviewed on page 383. 

The New Decameron, by various hands (225 pages; 
McBride), is reviewed on page 372. 

A Servant of Reality, by Phyllis Bottome (454 pages; 
Century), is reviewed on page 383. 

The Sea Bride, by Ben Ames Williams (305 pages; Mac- 
millan) , is a narrative of marriage and seafaring which 
captures interest in the first sentence and holds it 
consistently throughout a convincing interplay of char- 
acter and event. 

A Woman's Man, by Marjorie Patterson (336 pages; 
Doran), draws a skilful picture of Parisian life; the 
materials are handled with vigor and a confident 
grasp of character. The story traces the sordid ad- 
ventures of a self-conscious, selfish artist, whose as- 
pirations never carry him beyond the feverish fringe 
of creative work; but it had been a better job had the 
author catered less to the sensation-seeker. 

Hunkins, by Samuel G. Ely the (365 pages; Doran), mixes 
its politics and its tenses, evolving amid a great deal 
of conversation a none too robust story of municipal 
campaigns and corruption. It's all about an altruistic 
boss, whose favorite philosopher happens to be Hor- 



The Sinister Revel, by Lillian Barrett (363 pages; 
Knopf), beggars fancy and vocabulary in assisting a 
sensitive and weak heir to spend fifty millions. After 
the lurid depths and ethereal heights through which 
the author unfalteringly conducts you, you will feel 
more reconciled to your humble estate under H. C. 
L. which is no doubt the author's intention for you. 

Free Air, by Sinclair Lewis (370 pages; Harcourt, Brace 
& Howe), defends the new, unconventional America 
against that old America which still holds to family 
trees and class distinctions. It is a racy tale of a 
young mechanic and a Brooklyn Heights girl in an 
automobile trip through the Northwest.

Self Determination for All Peoples 

League of Oppressed Peoples 

True to her tradition America entered the War to overthrow imperialistic aggression 

and to establish freedom throughout the world. 

Yet certain politicians, generals, and financiers abroad, without the proper warrant or 

.consent of their own peoples are making a mockery of the principles which were so 

recently sanctified by American blood. 

Armies of coercion, defying common law, resorting to extreme violence and cruelty 

are being maintained in IRELAND, EGYPT, INDIA and KOREA. CHINA'S rights 

have been shamefully abused; PERSIA'S sovereignty compromised by intrigue and 

force majeur, preventable massacres of JEWS continue in various places, while by 

an illegal starvation blockade hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children 

in RUSSIA have been brought to agonizing death. 

All this is being done with money borrowed from liberty-loving America. 

America has poured out her blood for freedom. 

Shall she now pour out her dollars for oppression? 

You can make your protest really effective by joining the 

League of Oppressed Peoples

PEARSON'S MAGAZINE has moved to new quarters. One of 
these charming old houses, reminders of a New York al- 
most passed into oblivion, a New York of seventy-five years 
ago, when people built homes to live in and not apartments de- 
signed for sleeping quarters exclusively, we have leased from the 
Demarest estate at No. 8 Eaet 15th Street. 

PEARSON'S MAGAZINE has not ingratiated itself with pub- 
Ushers. We have not followed the tread of the times and of 
luring advertising copy, and have not sacrificed our individual 
opinion, the judgment which is the fruit of forty years of 
reading, and perehanee a certain inborn sense for beauty and 
art. We have always said what we actually thought. Our liking 
of books we have proclaimed, though others knew nothing of 
auther, publisher and book. 

Our book shop reflects our own attitude towards the written 
word. 

Our book shop is net designed to be a distributing place for 
the products of publishers who cater to the popularity of ex- 
tensively advertised authors. But we do wish to create a sanc- 
tuary for the friends of our solitude, for the writers who have 
become our intimates, with whom we have lived for years, who 
have grown upon us and whom we wish to introduce as friends 
to our friends. 

Life as it is, beauty, even if the beauty of ugliness, the best 
that was given us by the authors of all countries and of all 
languages; quaint books hardly known even to connoisseurs, queer 
people who remained strangers to the world as long as they lived, 
objects of curiosity to their contemporaries; books that bring us 
into intimate contact with the lives of great men and great 
women . . . and a congenial, comfortable place where you 
are always a welcome guest.

The Labor Crisis 



JL HE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RESOLUTION WHICH 

broke up the President's Industrial Conference for 
industrial peace, was the first section of what may 
become the final chapter of the American Federa- 
tion of Labor's unremitting effort to preserve the 
relation between employers and workers by which 
the industrial system now operates. The second 
section in that chapter is the miners' submission 
to the operators, in accordance with their estab- 
lished practice of preserving this industrial rela- 
tion, certain terms of work as a basis for negotia- 
tion and the refusal of the operators to consider 
the terms. The third and possibly the last section 
of the chapter is the action of the Federal gov- 
ernment in the issuance of the order restraining 
national trade union officials from strike action. 
The accumulated opposition of the employers, the 
Federal administration, the Federal Courts, Con- 
gress, State officials and legislatures leaves the 
Executive Council of the Federation and its na- 
tional unions without alternatives. It denies 



adopted the Plumb Plan. And as the policy of 
the Brotherhoods thereupon changed from one of 
gain to one o-f service, so the present opposition 
to the old policy of the Federation may force the 
Federation to shift the status of the workers from 
one of higglers in the wage market to that of men 
concerned with facts of industrial enterprise and 
economy. 

Walter N. Polakov in this supplement opens up 
the problem of coal production from the point of 
view of an engineer concerned with the economy 
of production conservation of wealth, and its use. 
He presents the facts of waste and leaves it to the 
public and the miners to decide whether or not the 
management of the nation's coal resources shall 
be left to privateers or pass to technicians and 
workmen equipped to render service and to con- 
serve coal. Neither Mr. Polakov nor the miners 
raise the question of ownership. We understand 
that the Constitutional provisions would be invoked 
and that under the provisions of the Constitution 



them the opportunity to uphold as they con- the fuel resources would be held as the private 
sistently have in the past a respect for business, property of the exploiters. Such sacred provisions 
t~~ <*** "la-orLr>rrW witVi its r.lpar-riit nolicv in the nast have been overcome: witness the con- 



current "law-and-order" with its clear-cut policy 
of protecting private and disregarding public in- 
terest. The Federation, being forced to adopt 
another policy just as the Brotherhoods were forced 
to bring forward a program of responsibility 
for transportation, may seek to substitute the 



in die past have been overcome; witness the con- 
fiscation by prohibition. But the immediate mat- 
ter of importance for public decision is whether 
or not the present administration of the coal fields 
shall end; whether or not the alternative shall be 
adopted of transferring the administration of the 



policy of agreement with the public to render work- coal resources to an organization of men compe- 

manlike service for the old policy of bargaining tent to mine coal, together with technicians expert 

with employers for a division of the spoils. This in problems of industrial engineering, chartered 

transfer of policy may occur overnight. Literally, for the purpose of operating the mines in the

Coal: A Mismanaged Industry 



I 



I. EDITORIAL SUMMARY 



N ITS MOST SUPERFICIAL ASPECT the coal ques- 
tion is one of hours and wages, amenable to ad- 
justment by collective bargaining. But the funda- 
mental issues involved are beyond the compass of 
the diplomats of capital and labor; they demand for 
their solution the best efforts of the technicians 
of production scientists, engineers, laborers; and 
every year that leaves these questions unsolved 
involves the country in losses compared with which 
the waste involved in a coal strike is as nothing. 

Everyone is astonished to learn what the miners 
want because no one knows what they have got. 
To begin with, they want to rest two days in seven, 
but they also want to work the other five. This 
represents a demand for 250 working days a year 
3% to 21% more days per year than miners 
have ever worked in the history of the American 
coal industry! 

The miners want a six-hour day. In 1917, when 
maximum production was essential, and when the 
mine-labor force had been considerably diluted 
by the substitution of unskilled men for experi- 
enced workers withdrawn for military or war- 
industry service, the length of the working day was 
reduced 4.8%, the number of days increased 5.6% 
and the total output of the mines increased 9.8%. 
The total coal production for the country was actu- 
ally 12,000,000 tons in excess of what it would 
have been if the individual workers had produced 
no more coal per hour than the more experienced 
force produced in 1916. Within reasonable lim- 
its, productivity per man per day is inversely pro- 
portional to the length of the day. The "reason- 
able limit" for the naming industry is fully discussed 
in the engineer's report which follows. 

The miners want a 60% raise in wages. Before 
the war, in the Pennsylvania field, labor got 66c. of 
every dollar paid for coal, 28c. went for supplies 
and general expenses, and 6c. remained as the 
operator's margin. During the war, labor's share 
shrank to 84.8% of the pre-war figure, general ex- 
penses fell off somewhat, and the operator's share 
increased 400%. If the operators would be con- 
tent with only double their pre-war margin, they 
could make a 30% raise in wages without trans- 
ferring one cent of this burden to the public in the 
form of an increase in coal prices. 

But sup.pose the miners' day, week, and wage 
demands are granted; and suppose that the opera- 
tors actually succeed in holding onto their huge 
profits, and in shifting the new charges to the 
public is this threatened price change the first 
or the greatest burden that the profiteering mis- 
management of the coal industry has imposed upon 
the country? The answer of expert testimony is 
that this threatened loss, like the loss incident to 



a strike, is negligible by comparison with the losses 
involved in the routine mismanagement of the- 
coal-business-as-usual. 

Under the present regime of businesslike bun- 
gling, it is more profitable to waste nearly 50% of 
all the coal that is mined than to save It by care- 
fully standardized methods of operation. If the 
miners go on digging nearly two tons of coal for 
every ton made available for consumption, it is 
probable that the fuel supply of the country will 
be exhausted in 100 years. By abandoning partly 
exploited mines, by leaving unreclaimed coal in 
the mines that are being worked, by failing to 
utilize coal dust, low-grade coal, and the various 
by-products of coal, the managers impose upon the 
resources of the country a loss that amounts to 
500,000,000 tons per year. This waste cannot 
be completely eliminated otherwise than by a thor- 
ough reformation of mining methods, and by the 
"manufacture" of coal into its various products 
electric power, benzol, tar, and the like at the pit 
mouth. 

A problem more easily controlled, but beyond 
the reach of the mine operators themselves, is that 
involved in the wastage of the coal now consumed 
in scattered industrial plants and In railway loco- 
motives. Eighty per cent of the annual product 
of the country is consumed in this way and one- 
fourth of this amount one-fifth of all tonnage 
delivered to consumers, is wasted because of faulty 
methods of firing. 

As business is now organized, the only way to 
enforce economy in consumption is by raising 
prices to the further profit of the prodigals who 
control the coal resources of the country, and the 
further exasperation of a hard-driven public. 

The miners see only the first elements of this 
problem they want to work more regularly than 
they have worked before, and they want more of 
the necessities and comforts of life than they have 
been receiving. .The public wants coal produced 
with the minimum expenditure of energy and the 
minimum waste of material, and it wants this pro- 
duct used with the maximum of economy in order 
that it may finally yield the maximum of consump- 
tion goods. 

If the operator is interested neither in the econ- 
omies of production nor in those of consumption, 
the engineer is interested in both, and a master of 
both. The workers may find temporary relief in 
dividing the spoils with the operators. But for 
labor there is no permanent relief, and for the 
public no relief at all. except in a permanent alli- 
ance of knowledge and interest of technicians and 
workers for the production of goods. A careful 
reading of the expert's report that follows can 
lead to no other conclusion.

II. ENGINEER'S REPORT 



H 



.AVING BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE DlAL PUB- 
LISHING COMPANY to report on the outstanding 
causes of the present grave situation developed in 
the industry of mining soft coal in the United 
States, I have the pleasure to submit the following 
findings: 

The data upon which the conclusions were based 
were secured chiefly from the Department of the 
Interior, the Bureau of Mines, the United States 
Geological Survey, and the Federal Trade Com- 
mission. 

The method pursued in the investigation was 
principally that successfully employed by a large 
number of progressive manufacturers of this coun- 
try, and broadly practiced during the war by the 
United States Shipping Board, by the Ordnance 
Department in some of their arsenals and in plac- 
ing outside contracts, and by the Aircraft Produc- 
tion. 

Upon the conclusion of this research the convic- 
tion was formed that the oustanding cause of the 
present situation, using Cardinal Bourne's expres- 
sion, is "that the men are subject to irritating mis- 
management." 

In the strict sense of the term it cannot be said 
that the coal operators ever managed their mines. 

Selling of product: "A substantial portion of 
the soft coal produced is sold through jobbers" 
(U. S. Geological Survey 11:4, page 19) so that 
the operators do not manage this substantial por- 
tion of the business. The Federal Trade Commis- 
sion reports that "a very large part of the output 
of the operator who reported no selling expenses 
(45%) reached the consumer through the jobbers 
or sales agencies. Probably also a considerable 
fraction of the output of the remaining 55% of 
the operators went through such channels." Also, 
"marketing has presented to the producer, big or 
little, no serious problems . . . operators had 
no direct connection with consumers." (U. S. Geo- 
logical Survey 11:4, page 17.) 

Accounting and cost keeping: The Federal 
Trade Commission and the United States Geologi- 
cal Survey agree in their references to the fact 
that often there is "ignorance of the cost" of pro- 
duction on the part of the operators. Such igno- 
rance was amply illustrated at the time when prices 
were first fixed. 

It was predicted that the output of the mines would be 
materially cut down if such prices prevailed, since . . . 
the operator (was) afforded no incentive to production. 
As a matter of fact there was actually no decrease in 
the production . . . Had it been possible for the mines 
in the Central Field to have been worked . . . ordinary 
full time with their then existing force, their actual pro- 
duction would have been increased 21 per cent. (Cost 
Report, Federal Trade Commission.) 

Methods of work and training of employees: 
These functions of management are chiefly left, 



contrary to the practice in many more advanced 
industries, to the judgment of workmen men work- 
ing on contract, fixing their own tools, keeping 
their own records. Machine operation is poorly 
developed; only 56.4% of coal was mined in this 
way in 1916, while in 1917 the machine-mined out- 
put-dropped to 55.5%. Wastefulness of time, of ma- 
terials, and of possible output is notorious. "Un- 
der the present wasteful methods of mining . . . ," 
says the United States Geological Survey, (11:4,) 
"the cost of opening the mines is not large." The 
United Mine Workers of America are aware of 
the fact that "from 33% to 50% of coal resources 
. . . are being despoiled under (such) a system 
of production." (United Mine Workers' Resolution.) 
The U. S. Geological Survey also figures out 
the waste in prevailing management of mines to 
be 50%. As an inevitable consequence of this 
general ignorance on the part of the mine operators, 
a desire to safeguard their interests led them to: 

(a) insist on longer hours in underground work 
than the conditions and requirements warrant, and 

(b) limit the wage rate. 

As opposed to this arbitrary exercise of power 
by the operators, the miners demand that (a) work- 
ing time be limited to five days of six hours dura- 
tion per week, and (-b) wages be advanced 60%. 

Whether or not these demands are likewise ar- 
bitrary will be discussed later in this report, al- 
though of necessity in a brief and non-technical 
manner. 

COAL REQUIREMENTS 

Unlike food, coal, this most fundamental com- 
modity, is not stored, cornered, or hoarded in 
any large quantities. Substantially it is produced 
in the quantities required for immediate consump- 
tion, since its bulk, the danger of spontaneous 
combustion, deterioration due to weathering, and 
expensive re-handling have always made unprofit- 
able the practice of accumulation. Insignificant ex- 
ceptions occur when coal is kept in ears or when 
distributors or consumers pile coal in their yards; 
but this does not apply to the coal operators, who 
have never solved the problem of storage. The prac- 
tice at the mines is to keep men idle whenever 
there are not enough cars to load the day's output. 

In view of these facts, barring occasions like 
the collapse of the railroads just before they were 
taken over by the government, the mines' output 
may be regarded as equal to the country's consump- 
tion. The amount of coal produced and consumed 
(the export was then less than 4%) before and 
during the war was as follows: 

Bituminous coal,

The industrial crisis into which we were rushing 
headlong in 1914 was reflected in the drop of coal 
consumption, but the war orders of the following 
years inflated coal consumption. A safe estimate 
of 1920 consumption (providing industrial de- 
pression does not continue) may be placed at 550,- 
000,000 tons of bituminous coal and at 130,000,000 
tons of anthracite. 

LABOR SUPPLY 

During these years the number of men employed 
to produce these quantities of bituminous coal was 
reported by the government as follows: 

1913 . 571,882 

1914 _ 583,506 

1915 557,456 

1916 561,102 

1917 603,0001 



1 Page 930. Coal in 1917, U. S. Geological Survey, II -32. The most recent 
estimate, that published in the United Mine Workers' Journal, Novem- 
ber 1. 1919, gives the number of employees at present employed in 
bituminous coal mines as 655,000 men. 



From these figures it becomes at once apparent 
that there is an inconsistency between the numbers 
of men employed and the amount of coal produced 
per individual. The lowest production (1914) 
coincides with the largest number of men; hence 
we must inquire into the number of days the men 
were employed. 

NUMBER OF WORKING DAYS 2 

The Department of the Interior published the 
following data on the number of days work was 
conducted in the mines: 



232 
195 
203 
230 
2433 



2 U. S. Geological Survey 11:4, page 17. 

3 Computed on basis of 5.7% increases over preceding year. 



1919 



THE DIAL 



397 



During the peak year, 1918, the average number 
of working days, by districts, was as follows: 

Pittsburgh district 260 

Ohio , 224 

Indiana 249 

Illinois . ._ 228 



Average number of days per year 242% 

These conditions do not represent the average 
pre-war experience, as in the same districts the 
average number of days worked for the six years 
(1913-1918) was as follows: 

Pittsburgh district 233 

Ohio 181 

Indiana 199 

Illinois . _ 201 



Average number of days per year__ 206 J- 

In other words, out of a possible 304 working 
days per year, productive work was carried on only 
two-thirds of the time, and even during the greatest 
rush for maximum production, in the second half 
of 1917, 30% of the time was wasted at the mines. 

The reasons for this idleness were analyzed for 
the three representative states and are shown on 
Figure 1. Almost one-fifth of the production 
was lost on account of lack of work; that is, the 
men were not permitted to work because the man- 
agement did not provide either cars to move coal 
or storage to hold it. About 6% of the time was 
lost because of one or another of managerial 
causes, and about 4% due to "lack of help." It 
does not seem reasonable to complain of lack of 
help when the help available is idle under compul- 
sion one-quarter of the time; yet it is just this unsys- 
tematic, sporadic management of mines that breeds 
unsteady industrial habits among the employees. 

In other words, over 200,000,000 tons are yearly 
left unmined on account of time lost through the 
fault of operators and railroads. However, no 
serious of objections are being made to this state of 
affairs, for the obvious reason that the country 
is not using any more coal than is being mined 
in the remaining 70% of available time. The 
miners' demand of five working days per week 
represents, with the omission of two weeks for 
holidays and vacations, 250 working days during 
the year. As the governmental statistics show, 
there was never a call for so large a number of 
working days in the history of the United States. 
The highest number of days the work was going 
on was in the peak year of 1918, when it was 
242% days in the central competitive district, 
while the average for six years was 2061/2 days 
in that district and 221 days for the entire country. 
It means, therefore, that the miners offer to work 
from 13% to 21% more days than they were ever 
called upon to work. 



LENGTH OF WORKING DAY 

For seven years, from 1910 to 1916 inclusive, 
the* percentage of miners working eight hours per 
day was steadily decreasing, averaging about 
60%. Those working nine hours had a tendency ' 
to increase, rising from 15.5% to 17.5%, while 
the proportion of men working ten hours per day 
remained stationary at about 25%. In 1917, 
when the war industries demanded increased 
productivity of labor, when some 80,000 miners 
went to the colors and some 35,000 men found 
more attractive and safe employment in munition 
factories, and so left the mines, a wise move was 
made which proved to be highly successful in 
increasing the productivity of labor: The length 
of the working day was materially reduced. 

Figure 2 illustrates how the percentage of 
10-hour men was reduced from 25% to 8.5%; 
9-hour men from 7.5% to 12..5%; and the 8-hour 
men increased their proportion from 60% to 79%. 

FIGURE 2. MORE WORK IN LESS TIME 

In 1917 the proportion of miners working on a short-day schedule was 

much greater than in 1916. If the average eutpnt per man per hour had 

remained at the 1916 level, the country's coal production for 1917 would 

have been about 539,000,000 tons. Actually it was 551,790,563 tons.

In plain figures it means that in 1917 all the men 
together worked 46,648,700 hours less than they 
would have worked with the longer hours the year 
before. In 1915 and 1916, the country's average 
coal production per employee per hour was 0.48 
ton ; other things being equal, the reduction of work- 
ing hours should have reduced the coal production 
if working hours were in direct relation to the pro- 
ductivity. In fact, reduced fatigue, more uniform 
work, and better pay stimulated the productivity of 
labor, and the year's production was 42,270,881, 
tons more than for the previous year, and some 
12,000,000 tons in excess of what it would have 
been if the output per man per hour had not 
increased. 

PRODUCTIVITY OF LABOR 

Thus the reduction of the length. of the working 
day in this case, as well as in the experience of 
Lord Leverhulme and others, increased the produc- 
tivity of labor. In the case of the miners this 
increase over the straight arithmetical proportion

was very considerable. Taking the total number of 
tons of bituminous coal produced per year and div- 
iding it by the number of hours all mine employ- 
ees worked per year, we get an output ratio per 
man-hour. It appears thus : 

1913 .41 tons 

1914 .42 

1915 .44 

1916 -44 

1917 .47 

1918 .48 

A serious error into which the statisticians of 
the United States Geological Survey fell was that 
they adopted "day" as a measure for comparison 
of man's productivity instead of an hour, and fig- 
ured out that in 1917 the men's efficiency dropped 
3%. The misconception is obvious. It we accept the 
United Mine Workers' figures of 655,000 4 as the 
number of mine workers in bituminous mines 
to-day, the output of 550,000,000 tons with a 
six-hour day and a five-day week will require 
a productivity per man-hour of .56 tons; that is, 
there is no question that the country's needs can 
in that case be supplied without any considerable 
change in mining methods. Care must however be 
exercised to move cars on the new production sched- 
ule. 

We can not close our analysis here, however, 
as during 1917 a number of other influential 
changes took place. First, 11 % of experienced 
mine workers were withdrawn (4% to military 
service and 1% to other lines of industry), and 
the industry was thus of necessity diluted by the 
101,000 newcomers, whose comparative weakness 
in skill, training, technical habits, and so forth 
somewhat reduced the high productive efficiency of 
the old miners. Second, the total increase in the 
number of men employed in the bituminous mines 
was 7.5%. 

While the correction in the first cause may not 
be made precisely, the effect of the second cause 
can be accounted for. Productive labor in the coal 
industry is that employed underground, and in 
1917 it represented 19% of the total. This por- 
tion was increased only 5%, whereas the surface 
labor, which only handles the coal already mined, 
was increased 21%. Now, with the help of simple 
arithmetic, we may hope to ascertain the average 
production per underground man per hour. 

1917 

Total number of employees 603,000 

79% underground 476,370 

Average number of hours per day 

Total number of days work 

Total number of man-hours per year 960,812,523 

Total tonnage mined 551,790,563 

Tons per man-hour .574 

Now let us compare it with the year before, when 
longer hours prevailed. 

4 See Note 1, page 396. 



1916 

Total number of employees 561,102 

Total number of underground men (about 

81%) 453,700 

Average number of hours per day 8.7 

Total number of days work 230 

Total number of man-hours per year 907,853,700 

Total tonnage mined 502,519,682 

Tons per man per hour .553 

In other words, with the reduction of the average 
length of the day, the average man's productivity 
per hour increased in the same ratio. While the 
length of the working day was reduced 4.8%, 
and the number of days increased 5.6%, "the total 
output of the mines increased 9.8%. 

FACTORS INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY 

It thus appears that with a five-day week instead 
of a six-day, the management of the mines will 
have two days per week time to arrange the busi- 
ness so that the loss of time and idleness due to 
repairs, car shortage, and so forth may be reduced 
and a full time of 250 days devoted to work. This 
means an addition of 44 to 49 days of mining 
work per year over the past six years' average. 
With a six-hour net working day (eight hours actu- 
ally underground, including descent and walking 
"to face coal" and return) the miners propose 
1500 working hours yer year. To meet the esti- 
mated future demand of 550,000,000 tons of bitu- 
minous coal, hourly productivity of each of the 
502,000 underground miners must be .735 tons 
as against the past average of .575 tons. In order 
that the error may be on the side of caution, 
these computations are based on the latest avail- 
able government figures, and not on the more recent 
statistics of the United Mine Workers, which indi- 
cate that a much smaller increase would be requir- 
ed. The question now, therefore, is whether a 28% 
increase of productivity may be expected. 

The productivity of labor depends upon four 
major conditions apart from a score of minor 
ones: (a) mode of management; (b) fatigue; 
(c) standard of living; (d) equipment and tech- 
nique. 

(a) The present mode of management in a pre- 
dominating majority of mines is very primitive, 
and such as was long ago abandoned in more pro- 
gressive industries. The men are working on con- 
tract; that is, they are paid per ton mined a stipu- 
lated amount, varying from the' basic rate of 
84 cents, and depending upon the size of the vein 
and other conditions. Men are not trained in the 
best way of performing the work; there is no 
tool rbom; they take care of their tools themselves; 
there are no planning departments with their varied 
and important functions, and the work generally 
proceeds much as the vim and mood of the indi- 



1919 



THE DIAL

vidual miner dictates, acting with greater or less 
skill. 

It has been the experience of every industrial 
engineer that by proper attention on the part of 
the management to those functions that are beyond 
the control of individual workers, the productivity 
of his time and labor can be more than doubled. 
Longer hours are usually prevalent in industries 
where the management lets the men attend to vari- 
ous minor managerial duties, naturally requiring 
a considerable portion of their time which is thus 
unavailable for production. When the manage- 
ment assumes its proper share of responsibility, 
the men, even with the existing degree of skill 
and efficiency, produce vastly more per hour. 
While such practice has not been applied, to my 
knowledge, to any coal mines, there is no reason 
to doubt that results similar to those attained in 
other industries could be secured. 

To illustrate the typical case of mismanagement 
of the mines it is enough to quote from the United 
States Geological Survey Report on Coal in 1917 
the following passage: 

The most certain way to increase capacity is to put 
on more men, and, as experienced inside men (the only 
productive men) were more difficult to obtain than day 
laborers, the outside force was augmented more rapidly 
(21% against 5%), and out of proportion to the normal 
requirements. Under the pressure for increased output, 
the operators, apparently without regard to its effect in 
costs, added labor of any description. (Page 931.) 

(b) Fatigue produced by industrial occupations 
has been carefully studied lately among other in- 
dustrial workers, and while, unfortunately, we have 
no data covering mine work, it is entirely reason- 
able to admit that work underground, in a hot, 
damp atmosphere, with poor artificial light, with in- 
halation of coal dust and injurious gases, and under 
the great nervous strain created by ever-present dan- 
ger to life and limb, causes a greater degree *t>f 
fatigue than in the more sanitary surroundings of 
factories, mills, or power plants. Moreover, it 
must be noted here that the so-called eight-hour 
day in reality averages ten hours or more, as the 
miners spend nearly an hour at each end in going 
down, waiting for elevators or trains, in walking 
underground to the work place, and so forth, all 
of this time being outside of the nominal eight 
hours. Incidentally, one hour for dinner is of neces- 
sity also spent at work, as the perspiring man does 
not dare to rest underground at the risk of severe 
damage to his health. The experiments conducted 
for years by Lord Leverhulme in his Port Sun- 
light and other factories in England proved to 
him the advantage of a six-hour working day. Again, 
Professor Charles S. Myers, of Cambridge Univer- 
sity, after a large number of observations on the 
effect of industrial fatigue on efficiency, number 



of accidents, and output, shows that productivity 
rises in proportion as sufficient rest is provided. 

Dr. Fred W. Taylor, Mr. Babcock of the Frank- 
lin Motor Company, and a number of other in- 
dustrial managers, have proved beyond any doubt 
that production increases with the reduction of 
working hours. 

The writer's experience with the effect of shorter 
hours on stationary firemen (see Industrial Man- 
agement, November 1919), similarly indicates that 
a reduction of hours from twelve to eight and fur- 
ther to six per day increases attentiveness, quality 
of work, and efficiency to such an extent as to make 
possible the employment of an additional shift of 
men, the raising of hour- wages 33 1/3% to main- 
tain the weekly wage at the old level, and the pay- 
ment of a bonus. 

(c) While the first two factors mode of man- 
agement and reduction of fatigue alone are more 
than sufficient to offset the proposed reduction 
of time, the effect of better living conditions can- 
not be overlooked. With two more hours to him- 
self and to his family, a higher type of man can- 
not fail to develop. 

(d) Lastly, the equipment used in a large por- 
tion of mines is not of the character permitting 
to-day a maximum output and the best conserva- 
tion of human energy. 

From the foregoing the conclusion is unescap- 
able that, with the interest and goodwill of the 
miners secured, so moderate an increase in produc- 
tivity as 28% is an assured possibility. Its real- 
ization requires, however, proper cooperation of 
the management, as evinced in a willingness to 
study the conditions of work and to remove such 
obstacles as stand in the way of securing a full 
ouput. 

It might be of interest in connection with the 
proposal for arbitration to mention that with six 
days per week and a six-hour day the productivity 
per man-hour should be only 0.61 tons; that is, 
6.3% higher than the present average in order to 
secure with the present number of miners the out- 
put of 550,000,000 tons annually. Again, with 
a five-day week but a seven-hour day the produc- 
tivity per inside-man per hour ought to be 0.625 
tons, or 8.9% higher than the present. The pos- 
sibility of achieving either increase is a positive 
certainty even without any help and co-operation 
on the part of the management. 

WASTAGE AT MINES 

The above analysis is based on the assumption 
that we need to mine as much coal during the next 
years as has been consumed during the peak years 
of feverish war production. It provides also at the 
same rate for lavish losses incurred under the 
excuse that "cost is no object" in "making the world 



400 



THE DIAL

safe for Democracy" and "a better place to live in." 
Having shown that a reduction of working hours 
per day tends to increase the coal production, con- 
serve our human resources, and satisfy our huge 
demands, we must now inquire whether it is con- 
sistent with national economy to continue the same 
mode of production at the rate indicated. 

It is an established fact that nearly 50% of 
the coal mined is wasted under the present form 
of management. It means that a mine must yield 
almost two tons before one ton is made available 
for consumption. 5 

The causes of this wanton destruction of our 
natural resources are many, but the most glaring 
and the least excusable are these: 

1. A system of mining which leaves a large 
quantity of coal inside the mines, unreclaimed. 

2. Wastage of a considerable amount of coal 
dust or inferior (impure) fuel. 

3. Abandoning partially exploited mines. 

4. Neglecting to utilize by-products and mul- 
tiple products of mines. 

To visualize the extent of the losses falling under 
the first three heads, as incurred since 1844, we 
must picture to ourselves a pile of coal 1540 feet 
wide, 1540 feet long, and 770 feet high, containing 
7,541,550,000 tons of coal that never reached the 
consumers. 

Estimates have been made that if our consump- 
tion of coal and the proportion of its waste con- 
tinue at the same rapidly increasing rate, the 
supply will probably not last 100 years. This 
means it will not outlast even our own grand- 
children. The toleration of this appalling rate of 
destruction cannot be justified on technical 
grounds, for the difficulties of recovery are negli- 
gible. Indeed, the means are well known and quite 
simple: mines can be completely scraped of 'coal, 
and projects have even been brought forward to 
burn out the last remains of fuel and transform 
it 'locally into electricity without bringing it to 
the surface. Coal dust, anthracite "culm," and 
so forth, could be flushed by water through pipes 
into nearby power plants, or briqueted. The 
reason why these things are not being done 
why mines are abandoned if ash content is 
found to be high, why various by-products are 
not derived are that under the existing mode 
of financing the mines it is more profitable to the 
private owners to throw the life and prosperity 
of our grandchildren away than to incur the ex- 
penses for reclamation of waste. Indeed, no coal 
operator can be blamed for not mining coal at a 
cost of $4 per ton to sell it at a price of $2, or for 
refusing to clean excessive amount of ash, slate, 
and bone at a cost exceeding his possible margin. 



5 See Professional Paper 100-A, Department of Interior, 1917. 



Neither can it be expected under the existing econ- 
omic relations that mine operators will supply 
the territory, say 300 miles in radius, with electric 
power made at the mouth of their mines, in 
addition to such by-products of coal as ammonium 
sulphate, tar, benzol, and other derivates. True 
enough, such a scheme at present market prices 
would realize them on sale from eight to ten times 
more revenue than does the marketing of the 
raw coal. Numerous difficulties of a financial, 
legal, and political nature, however, would stand 
in the way, and Federal legislation should be in- 
voked to remove the obstacles and realize for the 
nation the unappreciable values that our coal re- 
sources contain. The United States Fuel Adminis- 
tration has estimated that today coal suitable 
for eoke production is being mined at a rate 
of 175,000,000 tons annually, yet only a small 
portion of this amount is thus converted into mul- 
tiple products. During this process, again, enor- 
mous losses are tolerated for the sake of imme- 
diate return at a sacrifice of our future welfare. 
Not to mention the inefficiency of common coke 
ovens, the "breeze" or the by-product of coke, 
which in itself is a fairly good fuel is largely 
thrown away. 

If 500,000,000 tons of bituminous coal mined 
yearly was manufactured even crudely at the mines, 
instead of being sold and shipped in its raw state, 
we would get available the following: 

1. 5,000,000 tons ammonium sulphate; the nitro- 
gen available in this quantity is capable of increas- 
ing wheat production by 453,165,000 bushels, 
based on 115 pounds of nitrogen to fertilize one 
acre. 

2. 1,000,000,000 gallons of benzol, which is con- 
sidered superior to gasoline as motor fuel. The 
value of this by-product by itself would be over 
$200,000,000 per year, and would be sufficient to 
transport 10,000,000 tons an average distance of 
10 miles. 

3. 4,000,000,000 gallons of tar would be of im- 
measurable value for the extension and improve- 
ment of rural highways. 

The total value of these cumulative products 
manufactured from raw coal is, in rough figures, 
about $8,000,000,000. Since the crude products 
of the mine is being sold at a probable average of 
$5 per ton, the loss of value due to the present 
state of the coal industry is about $5,500,000,000 
per year. 

LOSSES IN THE USE OF COAL 

Fully 80% of the coal mined is used as fuel in 
industries and transportation. Of the remaining 
20%, 6% is consumed as domestic fuel, which 
is chiefly anthracite, and 4*% exported. The United 
States Fuel Administration, as well as all private 
investigators, agree that not less than 25% of in-

COAL UTILIZATION CHART 





dustrial coal is wasted, and this loss can be pre- 
vented by more careful method of firing, without 
any investment in improved generating equip- 
ment. 

Preventable loss of bituminous coal in the coun- 
try therefore amounts to at least 100,000,000 tons. 
Assuming now, together with the expert engineer 
of the U. S. Fuel Administration, that we have 
not enough experts to teach all firemen at once 
how to save coal, we place the amount of immedi- 
ately preventable coal waste at 50,000,000 tons 
per year. This amount represents 9% of the total 
soft coal production. 

Figures 3 and 4 represent a typical industrial 
power plant's coal records before and after 
the management inaugurated systematic training 
of firemen and the payment of a secondary rate for 
accomplishing a desired saving in coal. Each day 
the record for each shift of firemen is figured 



out and is shown graphically; the length by which 
the bar is short of the daily space represents the 
loss that occurred. It will be noted that in the 
beginning the waste of coal averaged 25% or 
more amounting to nearly 150 tons lost every 
week. On Figure 4 such loss is no longer pres- 
ent; in fact, more power than was expected is pro- 
duced by the coal used. This is indicated by the 
extra length of bar extending over the dally space. 
The average yearly saving of coal in this actual 
case was over 7,500 tons. 

The significance of this typical case is this: 
Seventy-five hundred tons of coal is equivalent 
to: 

(a) 15,000 hours of miners' work saved, 

(b) 60,000 cars miles' travel saved. 

(c) $40,000 made available for other purposes.

FIGURE 5. How THE COAL OPERATORS WON THE WAR 

During the war, labor's share of the dollar paid for coal shrank to 84.8% of the pre-war figure, while the operator's share increased 400%. If the 
operators would be content with only double their pre-war margin, they could make a 30% raise in wages without transferring one cent of this burden 

to the public in the form of an increase in coal prices.

power plants and railroads of the country, we 
can readily accomplish a tremendous and far- 
reaching national economy. A great deal of our 
car-shortage, long working day at mines, and so 
forth, is undoubtedly caused by reckless, unscien- 
tific or merely indifferent methods of plant opera- 
tion. Yet only the most far-sighted coal mine 
operators realize that their own interest coincides 
with the national welfare in fostering and promul- 
gating the campaign for increased efficiency of 
power plants, as thereby their own coal, in pro- 
ducing better economic results, will fetch a higher 
market price. 

COAL PRICES 

The average pre-war realized price of coal, as 
calculated by government agencies, appears to be 
$1.17 per net ton. It was gradually declining from 
1913 to the end of 1915. In the winter of 1916- 
17 the prices were about 25 % above that average. 
After our entry into the war,^the coal prices in- 
creased by leaps and bounds, and reached the high- 
est point in June, 1917 (210%), when the average 
spot price was $3.77. At that time the margin 
realized on the sale of coal was 600% higher than 
in 1916. 

The Government fixing of prices brought prices 
temporarily down, but the lowest figure, in October 
1917, was still 180% of the pre-war prices. 

The wage advance in November 1917 was re- 
flected on the advance of coal prices to an extent 
of less than 4%, but the Fuel Administration au- 
thorized a gradual raise of selling prices until 
a maximum was reached in May 1918, when the 
average was 235% above pre-war level; in May 
1918 a general reduction of ten cents was ordered. 

From April to December 1918 the division of 
every dollar paid by the consumer was such that 
the margin of profit was near-ly 400% of the pre-

war average, while labor's share shrank to 84.8% 
of its former part. 

In February 1919 governmental regulation of 
coal prices was discontinued by executive order, 
presumably because the war conditions have ceased 
to exist. 

Since November 1917, that is, for two years, 
no wage advance has been allowed. 

DIVISION OF REALIZED DOLLAR 

Our diagram No. 5 illustrates the division of a 
dollar paid by consumers for coal as reported by 
the Federal Trade Commission for the Central Field 
of Pennsylvania. The condensed figures are of

It thus appears that should labor be granted 
a 60% raise, with the same amount for margin and 
the same expenses, the price of coal is likely to 
increase 33%. Inasmuch as this increase affects 
all classes of labor and all rates, still another way 
of computing the effect may be used to present the 
possible consequences. 

If labor, representing about 75% of the total 
production cost and averaging in typical cases 
$1.60 per ton, receives an increase of 96c. ; if sup- 
plies and expenses decrease slightly in relative cost, 
because of increased productivity ; and if the margin 
remains at the 1918 figure 85c.; we get:

In this case the increase will be about 29.5%.

showing that no increase in the price of coal to the 
consumer will be necessary. 

EFFECT OF COAL PRICES 

The coal in the United States even to-day is ma- 
terially cheaper than elsewhere in the world. The 
immediate effects of this fact are important and 
significant: 

(a) It is wasted in a far greater degree than 
elsewhere, inefficiency of power generation in this 
country being notorious. 

(b) It creates a new and dangerous tendency 
of export to South America, England, Italy, and 
other countries. 

(c) It represents nearly one-third of our rail- 
road freight. 

(d) It retards our development of water power. 
Higher coal prices will therefore result in: 

(a) conservation of our national resources; 

(b) discouragement of foreign industrial com- 
petition carried on with the help our own coal ; 

(c) relief of railway congestion, better freight 
service, cheaper railroad maintenance; 

(d) stimulation of development of water power 
resources ; 

(e) promotion of remanufacture of coal into 
multiple by-products; 

(d) adoption of a plan for development of 
super-power stations at colleries with a net of elec- 
tric transmission; 

(g) extension of electrification of railways espe- 
cially by hydro-electric power in non-industrial 
communities ; 

(h) generally increasing abundance of cheap 
power with corresponding industrial prosperity. 

The popular belief that low-priced industrial 
fuel (such as. bituminous coal) is a contributing 
factor in the manufacture of low-priced commodi- 
ties does not stand the test of facts. During the 
early stage of our industrial development the abund- 
ance of coal, its location in proximity to iron ores, 
thick and exposed veins, and other factors stimu- 
lated the growth of American industrial activities 
to an -unparalleled extent. The natural resources of 
the country were almost free for the taking, and the 
savage sacking of the very foundation of our future 
national prosperity became customary. Economy 
in consumption, efficiency in the utilization of ap- 



parently inexhaustible resources, received no atten- 
tion. Today, with the end of our coal deposits 
in sight, the old reckless and wanton destruction 
becomes a crime against society; yet no other 
stimuli outside of moral considerations are at work 
to promote conservation, and by that we mean not 
limitation of results, but limitation of useless 
waste. 

Countries blessed with older civilization and 
with smaller fuel deposits were forced to develop 
a notable degree of engineering perfection, and the 
high cost of fuel was by no means a secondary 
motive in the thoroughness with which they avoid- 
ed all non-productive uses. The use of mine 
refuse, briquetted coal-dust, powdered coal, lig- 
nite, turf, and so forth, received the fullest atten- 
tion in Europe, in addition to the development of 
internal combustion engines with their nearly 
double fuel economy. Moreover, higher-priced 
fuel, as in England, made possible the conservation 
of human resources, and the introduction of the 
seven-hour day for miners; it stimulated the use 
of mechanical stokers, and, finally, caused the Re- 
construction Committee to recommend a compre- 
hensive plan of interconnected super-power sta- 
tions nationally operated. 



In concluding this survey we may sum up the 
characteristics of the coal industry as follows: 

1. Abundance of rich veins of high-grade coal- 
caused mining methods to remain primitive and 
inexpensive. 

2. It further resulted in neglect to exploit less 
profitable coal and other fuel deposits, thus creat- 
ing congestion of centralized coal traffic. 

3. Desire to place on the market low-priced high- 
grade coal doomed to waste up to 50% of the 
potential supply of coal in mines. 

4. Unscientific mode of management causes 
30% lost time, with consequent tendency to keep 
workers long hours during the remaining time. 

5. Quasi-public spirit assumes that increase of 
fuel price injures industry. 

6. Individual operation of coal mines detached 
from public service prevents utilization of mul- 
tiple products of coal. 

The situation therefore resolves itself into an 
unprecedented conflict of various social forces in 
two distinct planes. 

The welfare of our great commonwealth makes 
it imperative that the natural resources be placed 
at the service of the society to the fullest extent 
known to science and engineering; that the plun- 
dering of our mineral and human resources shall 
cease and that undeveloped possibilities shall 
be realized for the benefit of "the country. 

As opposed to this, the present organization for 
operating our coal mines is unable to render this 



404 



enlarged service; for it is equipped merely to do 
what it does; that is, sell to the public such service 
as it can at a price. Since this service is inade- 
quate, perpetuation of this regime means ruin of 
the country. Satisfaction of the new economic prob- 
lems of the country means a modification of the 
present regime. 

Out of this fundamental conflict between private 
advantage and public necessity grows a significant 
contest between the parties engaged in the industry. 
This conflict is merely a symptom, but at the same 
time it is a symbol. 

Labor's demand for regulated employment in- 
stead of disorganized convulsions between 195 and 
260 days per year points to the necessity of organ- 
ized production for satisfaction of the country's 
needs instead of the present muddle. 

Labor's demand for a higher standard of living 
signifies the manifest importance of achieving 
higher standards in utilizing the fruits of toil and 
the gifts of nature. 

We come at last to a vicious circle. If the 



wages are raised, profits go down or the prices of 
commodities go up. When the cost of living gets 
high, those of insufficient income limit consumption. 
Reduced consumption piles up idle charges and pre- 
vents reduction of prices. On the other hand, if 
wages are not raised the acute disproportion be- 
tween the purchasing capacity of the people and 
productive capacity of industry breeds revolutions. 

The answer must be sought on another plane 
in organization of production for consumption, 
not for sale and the subsequent division of revenues 
between those who had and those who did. 

The embryo of such a mechanism was tested 
during the war. We ascertained the needs of our 
army and of the Allies. We gave the authority 
to those who, we thought, knew what to do and 
how to do it. Capable men were selected, not 
elected. The criterion was not the cost, neither the 
profit, but service in the promotion of our*com- 
mon aim. 

This mechanism won the War. Let us use it to 
win the Peace. 

WALTER N. POLAKOV. 



The Coal Issue in Great Britain 



WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS of the armistice the 
question of the ownership and the control of 
the coal mines has become the dominant issue in 
British industrial politics, and it has been made 
dominant by the industrial power of the organized 
miners. 

That is the really significant fact. It is the in- 
dustrial not the political pressure that has told. 
The Labor Party in the House of Commons is far 
too small in numbers to be able to force an issue 
upon the unwilling majority; and there are few 
subjects which the coalition battalions are less 
anxious to approach than this of nationalization; 
but if the Labor Party is weak inside Parliament, 
the labor movement is strong outside, and the Min- 
ers' Federation of Great Britain is probably the 
most powerful trade union in tfle world. 

Therefore, when once the Federation took the 
decisive step of including the transference of the 
mines to public ownership as an essential item 
in a program of demands which it was prepared 
to support if necessary by industrial action, na- 
tionalization long regarded as a merely academic 
question came immediately into the forefront of 
immediate practical politics. The Government 
could ignore sixty parliamentary votes; but it 
dared not ignore 800,000 strike notices. 

That first step was taken last January at the 
Southport conference. The executive of the Fed- 
eration had put in a demand for a 30% increase 



in wages. The delegates decided to ask in addi- 
tion for: 

(a) Full maintenance for demobilized miners 
while unemployed. 

(b) The reduction of the statutory eight-hour 
day to six hours which would give a real working 
day of seven hours. 

(c) The nationalization of all mines and min- 
erals. 

The issue was joined. The miners, by their rep- 
resentative body, had determined on the use of 
their industrial power for the securing of nationali- 
zation, and by earlier resolutions they had declared 
that nationalization must include control by the 
workers. 

The Government's reaction was characteristic. 
Ministers failed entirely to realize that the 
miners were in earnest. It is their habit never 
to face economic issues while there seems a pos- 
sibility of evading or postponing them. They of- 
fered a wage increase of a shilling a day and a 
vague Committee of Enquiry. 

They were brought sharply back to realities. 
Another miners' conference met and decided to 
ballot the rank and file upon the question of a 
strike to enforce the demands. That brought Mr. 
Lloyd George on the scene with a request for delay 
and promise of a Royal Commission pledged to re- 
port by March 3. 

The ballot was taken. The result was startling. 



1919 



THE DIAL 



405 



In favor of striking 615,164 votes were cast only 
105,082 against. 

But even then the miners held their hand. They 
insisted that the commission should report by 
March 20, and they laid down strict conditions 
as to its constitution. Four of the thirteen mem- 
bers were to be nominated by the Federation; two 
others by the Government, with the approval of 
the Federation. 

That was the genesis of the "Sankey Commis- 
sion," which carried out that devastating enquiry 
into the workings of the coal industry and set all 
England wondering, now at the forensic skill of 
the miners, now at the revealed administrative in- 
competence of the owners and controllers of 
industry. 

The miners, it is worth noting, chose as their 
own representatives Robert Smillie and Frank 
Hodges (their president and secretary), Herbert 
Smith of the Yorkshire Miners' Association and 
Sir Leo Chiozza Money. They agreed with the 
Government upon the appointment of Sidney Webb 
and R. H. Tawney. This combination of experi- 
enced miners and sympathetic intellectuals proved 
a brilliant success. They dominated the whole con- 
ference and made of it a relentless exposure of 
the inefficiencies and brutalities of the capitalist sys- 
tem. They showed how the present organization of 
the trade brought waste and confusion. They ex- 
posed the whole system of profiteering. They 
drew attention to the scandal of royalties. 

Every day brought its new quota of startling 
facts. The public realized with a shock that the 
colliery owners' profits had trebled during the 
years of war, and that this had been rectified only 
partially by the excess profits tax. It realized that 
even the Coal Controller had been unable to check 
profiteering; that he had been compelled, in order 
to secure for a few weak companies the pre-war 
profits, to agree to an increase of price that put 
$125,000,000 into the pockets of the wealthy own- 
ers. It realized the heavy toll taken by the middle- 
man, the absurdities of a system which combines 
all the wastefulness of competition with all the 
plunder-possibilities of combination, and it real- 
ized more keenly than ever before the hard lot 
of the average miner, the risks of his life, the in- 
adequacy of his remuneration, the scandal of his 
housing. Two weeks' examination and cross ex- 
amination left the coal trade a discredited organi- 
zation plainly inadequate .to the country's economic 
needs. Incidentally it fully vindicated the miners' 
recourse to direct action to compel an unwilling 
government to give some consideration to urgent 
national needs even at the risk of incommoding 
powerful vested interests. 

The first report, issued, in accordance with prom- 



ise, on March 22, clinched the matter. The coal 
owners' three representatives sought refuge in 
silence and reported only on hours and wages. 
But the chairman and mine members agreed that 
"the present system of ownership and working in 
the coal industry stands condemned." 

The miners' three representatives, Mr. Webb, and 
Mr. Tawney reported that more efficient organiza- 
tion was essential, that the only alternatives were 
nationalization and trustification and that, since the 
latter would be clearly intolerable, "nationaliza- 
tion" ought to be, in principle, at once decided on. 

The chairman and the three other Government 
nominees were a little more cautious. They de- 
clared a change essential; they laid it down that 
the workers must have an effective voice in the 
direction of the mines. But they proposed to take 
further evidence in order to decide whether the 
new system should be "nationalization or a method 
of unification by national purchase or by joint 
control." 

In the matter of hours and wages Mr. Justice 
Sankey and his colleagues suggested a compromise 
which gave roughly half what the miners demanded. 

The same day Mr. Bonar Law announced that 
the Government would adopt the Sankey report in 
spirit and in letter. 

Accepting this statement as a definite pledge 
of the Government's intention, the miners agreed 
to accept the Sankey report. Everybody took it 
that the first big issue was decided; that the ex- 
isting system would be abolished and that it re- 
mained only for the Commission to discuss the 
precise form of the change by which unification, 
effective public control, and the worker's partici- 
pation in management could be secured 

The Commission sat again and examined various 
proposed schemes for effecting nationalization. It 
reported on June 20. 

This second report was a curious document. The 
coal owners' representatives and two of the Govern- 
ment nominees put themselves clean out of court. 
They merely declared "nationalization in any 
form detrimental to the development of the in- 
dustry and to the economic life of the country." 
They recommended a few unimportant reforms, but 
apparently contemplated the continuance of the 
existing system virtually without change. In view 
of the fact that the Government had already com- 
mitted itself to the Sankey declaration for total 
reforms, this made their report merely irrelevant. 

Eight members had seriously devoted themselves 
to the real issue. And of these seven (The Chair- 
man, Mr. Webb, Mr. Tawney, and the miners' 
representatives) declared in favor of nationaliza- 
tion. One (Sir Arthur Duckham) submitted, in- 
stead, a scheme for the creation of publicly con- 
trolled corporations.

November 1 



All the commissioners favored the state acquisi- 
tion (either by purchase or by confiscation) of min- 
ing royalties, and the placing of the retail dis- 
tributing trade in the hands of public bodies. 

It seemed that the contest was won. The Gov- 
ernment had agreed to carry out the revolutionary 
changes declared necessary by the interim Sankey 
report. Of eight commissioners who had given 
their minds to the problem, seven had declared 
that such changes were best effected by nationaliza- 
tion. The miners looked to the Government for 
the logical next step. 

But the coal interest is powerful in England, 
and Mr. Lloyd George has no strong predisposi- 
tion either to logic or to fidelity. The big capi- 
talists began to issue warnings. A large number 
of the Government's followers in the House of 
Commons declared that they would oppose any 
nationalization bill. 

Then the Government made its first move. The 
disclosures at the Commission had swung public 
sympathy against the coal owners and in favor of 
the miners. If nationalization was to be turned 
down and the Sankey pledge violated in spirit, it 
was essential to create an atmosphere of preju- 
dice, to turn opinion once more against the miners. 

Dramatically Sir Auckland Geddes announced 
on July 9 that the wage and hour provisions, of the 
Sankey award made it necessary to increase the 
price of coal by six shillings. 

The Government press took the cue promptly 
.and burst into violent denunciation of the miners 
for "profiteering" at the expense of the com- 
munity. 

The Miners' Federation replied by a destructive 
criticism of the calculations on which the six- 
shilling rise was based. The Government's arith- 
metic was shown to be faulty, its data inaccurate. 
It was shown conclusively that, making full allow- 
.ance for the diminution in production, an increase 
of two shillings and six pence a ton would have 
been ample. And the Government was forced to ad- 
mit that the diminution in production was due not 
to any slackness on the part of the miners as the 
capitalist press had freely asserted but to bad 
organization of transport. 

The Government tried another device. They of- 
fered to withhold the six-shilling rise if the miners 
would give up the right to strike for three months. 
Had this been accepted no doubt at the end of 
the three months the proposal would have been re- 
peated. But the miners in conference at Keswick 
declined to bargain away their basic right, repu- 
diated the suggestion that they were in any way 
responsible for the fall in output, demanded an 
inquiry into its causes, and promised full co-opera- 
tion in increasing production and effecting econ- 
omies if the Sankey report were carried out. 

The Government ignored the Keswick resolutions 
and the press campaign redoubled in violence. 



The miners and their leaders were virulently at- 
tacked. Even Mr. Justice Sankey became the tar- 
get of evidently organized abuse. 

And then, when it was believed that the ground 
had been sufficiently prepared by the press, Mr. 
Lloyd George launched his offensive. In a speech 
on August 18 he declared definitely against na- 
tionalization. His plan was to "promote union 
by amalgamation in defined areas" in other 
words, to set up a system of gigantic capitalist 
combines subject only to the vaguest supervision 
by the Government It was Sir Arthur Duckham's 
plans without the safeguards Sir Arthur had pro- 
posed. The Sankey report had become a scrap of 
paper. 

The miners were angry at the betrayal. They 
had been led by statement after statement to be- 
lieve that the Government meant to carry out the 
policy recommended by the Commission. They had 
been assured that if the "competent and highly 
expert tribunal" found that nationalization was a 
good business proposition, its recommendation 
would be accepted. 

It was on this assurance that the miners had 
voted to accept the interim report and to call off 
the strike. Now they found a not unusual expe- 
rience in dealing with governments that, as Mr. 
Vernon Hartshorn put it, "it was all a huge game 
of bluff," and that, for all the influence it had had 
on the Government's policy, the Commission might 
as well have made no investigation and no report 
at all 

The miners were angry; but they showed a re- 
straint under intense provocation which contrasted 
rather strikingly with the Government's reckless 
and flamboyant methods. A full delegate confer- 
ence was called at the beginning of September. 
It regretted that "the Government had no better 
scheme than the creation of great trusts," and re- 
iterated its conviction that Rationalization was the 
only solution. But it declined to take immediate 
industrial action, and- instead referred the whole 
question to the Trade Union Congress at Glasgow. 

That Congress met on September 10. The 
miners submitted a resolution pledging the Con- 
gress to "co-operate to the fullest extent" with the 
Miners' Federation "with a view to compelling the 
Government to adopt the scheme of national owner- 
ship and joint control recommended by the ma- 
jority of the Sankey Commission." 

The resolution instructed the Parliamentary 
Committee to interview the Prime Minister, and 
decided that in the event of a continued Govern- 
ment refusal a special congress should be called 
"to decide the form of action to be taken to com- 
pel the Government." 

That resolution, moved by Robert Smillie, the 
Miners' Federation president, and seconded by J. 
H. Thomas, the Railwaymen's secretary, was car- 
ried by 4,478,000 to 77,000. 



1919 



THE DIAL 



407 



By an almost unanimous vote the trade unions 
had taken up the challenge thrown down by Mr. 
Lloyd George to the miners. 

The interview with the Prime Minister took 
place on October 9. Mr. Lloyd George was in 
a character 'stic mood. He delivered an oration 
which lasted an hour. He denied that any pledge 
had ever been given. Suddenly he discovered that 
this Parliament had no mandate to deal with 
nationalization. He declared that in some myste- 
rious fashion the railway strike made the moment 
most inopportune for pressing the question. He 
delivered a little lecture on guild socialism which 
showed that he had not the slightest knowledge of 
the subject. Accurate knowledge is not Mr. 
George's forte, and he made it plain that he knows 
as little of the miners' problem as he knows about 
Teschen. "What we were struck with more than 
anything else," said Mr. Smillie afterwards to a 
Dally Herald representative, "was that Mr. Lloyd 
George seemed to be absolutely ignorant with re- 
gard to the whole principle and importance of 
nationalization." 

But the Prime Minister has also the obstinacy 
which often goes with ignorance. Once his mind 
has been made up for him, he is tenacious of the 
view which has been given him and which he is 
ill equipped to criticize for himself. And the net 
result of it all was a flat refusal to consider na- 
tionalization and a repetition of the trustification 
proposals. Mr. George's arguments were unimpor- 
tant; they were merely drawn from a not very clev- 
erly prepared brief. The essential thing is that the 
interests of which he is the mouthpiece have deter- 
mined on an obstinate resistance. 

There for the moment the matter lies. The call- 
ing of the special congress has been postponed 
until the return of the British delegation from 
Washington. But the issue has been clearly de- 



fined. Organized labor has declared its solid sup- 
port of the miners, and is considering ways and 
means of forcing the Government to carry nation- 
alization. Organized capital is equally determined 
to resist it . 

For the first time in British history the ground 
is cleared for a straight fight on a clear-cut issue 
of principle. It is no question of hours and wages 
but one of the whole structure of industry. It is 
the first big revolt against the wage-system itself; 
the first organized i and concerted attempt to 
substitute industrial democracy for industrial 
oligarchy. 

For the miners' demand, let me repeat, is not 
merely for nationalization. It is for national own- 
ership and for joint control by the workers and 
the community. The details of the proposal are 
set out in the draft bill of which the complete text 
is printed below. They differ in detail from 
Mr. Justice Sankey's own proposal. They en- 
visage a more democratic form of organiza- 
tion. But the basic principle is the same. It is 
the principle of the Plumb Plan. It is at bottom 
the principle of Guild Socialism that industry 
should be carried on by democratically organized 
bodies of workers in co-operation, with, and for 
the benefit of, the community. 

It would be foolish to prophecy the events of 
the next few months to attempt to predict on what 
action- the special Congress will decide or to fore- 
tell the immediate result of that action. 

But this, at any rate, is certain. That British 
labor has definitely passed from its period of pre- 
occupation with questions of wages and hours; 
it has decided to use its economic power for the 
construction of a new model of industry. This 
is a fight which, once begun, must inevitably gc- 
forward to a decision.

PURCHASE OF MINES 

The Mining Council shall purchase the mines of Great 
Britain in them vested by this Act (other than those which 
are the property of the Crown at the time of the passing 
ef this Act or which have been disclaimed in whole or in 
part in accordance with Section V (3) of this Act) at 
the price and in the manner provided by this Act. Provided 
always that the value of any rights as defined by Section 
V (1) (c) of this Act shall not be taken into account in 
computing such price, for all of which no compensation 
shall be paid. 

VII. 

MINES COMMISSIONERS 

(1) For the purpose of assessing the purchase price of 
mines it shall be lawful for His Majesty, by warrants under 
the sign manual, to appoint ten Commissioners, to be styled 
the Mines Purchase Commissioners (herein called the Com- 
missioners) of whom one, appointed by His Majesty, shall 
be chairman. 

(2) Three of the said Commissioners shall be nominated 
by the Association known as the Miners' Federation of 
Great Britain, and three by the Association known as the 
Mining Association of Great Britain. 

(3) At the expiration of twelve months from the passing 
of this Act, in the event of a majority of the Commissioners 
failing to agree as to the purchase price of a particular 
mine or of its associated properties, it shall be lawful for 
the Chairman himself to fix the purchase price of such 
mine, which price shall then be deemed to be the price 
fixed by the Commissioners, but, save as herein expressly 
provided, the finding of a majority of the Commissioners 
voting on any question or as to the purchase price of mines 
shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties. 

(4) It shall be lawful for His Majesty to remove any 
Commissioner for inability or misbehavior. Every order 
of removal shall state the reasons for which it is made, 
and no such order shall come into operation until it has 
lain before the Houses of Parliament for not less than thirty 
days while Parliament is sitting. 

(5) The Commissioners may appoint and employ such 
assessors, accountants, surveyors, valuers, clerks, messen- 
gers, and other persons required for the due performance 
of their duties as the Treasury on the recommendation of 
the Commissioners may sanction. 

(6) There shall be paid to the Commissioners and to 
each of the persons appointed or employed under this sec- 
tion such salary or remuneration as the Treasury may sanc- 
tion; and all such salaries and remuneration and the ex- 
penses of the Commission incurred in the execution of their 



duties, to such amount as may be sanctioned by the Treas- 
ury, shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament. 

VIII. 
VALUATION OF MINES 

(1) The Commissioners shall, as soon as may be after 
the passing of this Act, cause a valuation to be made 
of all mines other than those disclaimed, whether or not 
developed or working or abandoned or exhausted, in Great 
Britain, showing what on August 4th, 1914, and what at 
the date of the passing of this Act was respectively the 
total ascertained value of each mine and its associated 
properties and the rights, as defined by Section V (1) (c) 
of this Act, therein, and the total ascertained value of such 
mine and its associated properties respectively exclusive 
of such rights; and the owner of every mine and any per- 
son receiving any rents, interest, or profit from any mine 
or possessed of any rights therein or connected therewith, 
on being required by notice by the Commissioners, shall 
furnish to the Commissioners a return containing such 
particulars as the Commissioners may require as to his 
property, rent, interest, profits, or rights in snch mine. 

(2) The Commissioners may likewise cause any mine to 
be inspected, require the production of documents, or do 
any other thing which may, in their opinion, be necessary 
to fix the purchase price of the mine or its associated prop- 
erties. 

(3) The Commissioners in making such valuation shall 
have regard to returns made under any statute imposing 
duties or taxes or other obligations in respect of mines, or 
minerals or rights, and to any information given before or 
to any Commission or Government Department, including 
the Coal Industry Commission constituted under the Coal 
Industry Commission Act, 1919. 

IX. 

ASCERTAINMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE 

(1) The purchase price of mines exclusive of associated 
properties (other than mines in the possession of the Crown 
at the time of the passing of this Act) shall be computed 
subject to, the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) of 
this section by ascertaining the average annual number of 
tons of minerals actually raised during the five years pre- 
ceding August 4th, 1914: 

Provided that as regards coal-mines in no case shall the 
maximum purchase price, exclusive of associated properties, 
be taken to be more than the following: 

When 100,000 tons or less have been raised s. d. 
per annum on the average during such 
five preceding years, a capital sum 
equal to one such year's output at 12 per ton 

When more than 100,000 tons have been 
raised per annum on the average dur- 
ing such five preceding years, a capital 
sum equal to one such year's output at 10 per ton 

(2) The Commissioners in arriving at such computation 
shall also have regard to the actual gross and net profits 
which have been made in the mine during such years or 
thereafter and to the amounts which may have been set 
aside from time to time for depreciation, renewals, or de- 
velopment, and to the probable duration of the life of the 
mine, and to the nature and condition of such mine, and to 
the state of repairs thereof, and to the assets and liabilities 
of any mine undertaking existing at the time of purchase 
which are transferable to the Mining Council under section 
XVI of this Act. 

(3) Provided further that where a coal-mine, in the 
opinion of the Commissioners, has not been fully developed, 
the amount which would be raised under full development 
without any increase of capital expenditure shall be taken 
as the average annual number of tons raised, and the maxi- 



410 



THE DIAL 



November 1 



mum purchase price in such case shall be taken to be a 
capital sum equal to the product of such number of tons 
and 12s. or 10s. per ton respectively, for the purpose of 
ascertaining the maximum value per ton under sub-section 
(1) of this section. 

X. 

ISSUE OF STATE MINES STOCK

associated properties as have been purchased, as ascertain- 
ed under the provisions of this Act, shall be paid by the 
Mining Council in mines purchase stock to the persons who, 
in the opinion of the Mining Council, have established their 
title to such stock. Provided that an appeal shall lie to the 
High Court under rules to be framed by the High Court 
from the decision of the Mining Council as to the title 
of any such persons, but for no other purpose. 

(2) For the purpose of paying such purchase price the 
Treasury shall, on the request of the Mining Council, by 
warrant addressed to the Bank of England, direct the crea- 
tion of a new capital stock (to be called "Guaranteed State 
Mines Stock"), and in this Act referred to as "the stock," 
yielding interest at the rate on the nominal amount of capi- 
tal equal to that payable at the date on which this Aet 
received Royal Assent on what, in the opinion of the Treas- 
ury, is the nearest equivalent Government Loan Stock. 

(3) Interest shall be payable by equal half yearly or 
quarterly dividends at such times in each year as may be 
fixed by the warrant first creating the stock. 

(4) The stock shall be redeemed at the rate of one hun- 
dred pounds sterling for every one hundred pounds of stock 
at such times and by such drawings as the Treasury, on the 
recommendation of the Mining Council may think fit. 

(5) The stock may be issued at such times and in such 
amounts and subject to such conditions as the Treasury 
may direct, and may be issued as bearer bonds with quar- 
terly or half yearly interest coupons attached. 

(6) The stock shall be transferable in the books of the 
Bank of England in like manner as other stock is trans- 
ferable under the National Debt Act, 1870.

A FEW APPRECIATIONS OF THE PENGUIN SERIES 



"The publishers of the Modern Library have again be- 
come benefactors of belles letters in publishing the Penguin 
Series." CHICAGO TRIBUNE. 

"This series is to consist, in the words of the publishers, 
of books of distinguished literary value that have never be- 
fore been published in America. Both of these qualifica- 
tions are possessed by the present volumes." THE NATION. 

"That attractive new series of books known as the Penguin 
Series." THE DIAL. 



^Pcnguia 



"Having given us the Modern Library with its interesting 
array of books at an exceedingly moderate price, its pub- 
lishers have initiated the Penguin Series that promises to 
fill a quite definite field of its own and to fill it quite charm- 
ingly." NEW YORK TIMES. 

"All that should be necessary to make these tastefully 
bound volumes, beautifully printed on .fine paper, highly 
popular, is to maintain their high standard of literary ex- 
cellence." NEW YORK TRIBUNE. 




PEGUIN SERIES includes books of distinguished literary value that have never before been pub- 
liehed in book form. While the first six volumes have not presented any authors unknown to the 
American reading public, the two fall volumes introduce George O'Neil, a young American poet of rare 
achievement and rarer promise* and Eduardo Zamacois, one of the greatest of living Spanish novelists. 
THE PENGUIN SERIES offers a home to short novels and collections of poems, plays, short stories and 
essays of exceptional worth, preference being given to the work of living American authors.

back to today's turbulent world the loveliness, the dreams and colors that are 
the saving reality of this sometimes too realistic age. 

Their Son and the Necklace By Eduardo Zamacois 

Translated by George Allan England 

In these two stories there are finely etched dramas of every day life which 
crash suddenly into unexpected and tremendous moments. These are stories 
)i love and passion, romance and beauty, and tragedy that is immense and ironic.

THE DIAL 



THE AWAKENING OF ASIA by H. M. Hyndman 

Author of "CLEMENCEAU: THE MAN AND His TIME." < ', 

HPHIS book is the outcome of forty-five years of study and intimate knowledge of the Far East a 
-- permanent book but also an extremely timely one for those interested in Shantung and other questions 
of present interest. 

"This is the language of a prophet stern, denunciatory, the embodiment of a flaming spirit of 
righteousness. The same downright vigor and interest characterize all of the opinions of the Far East 
expressed by this eminent Englishman. The reader is conscious of being in the presence of a man whose 
mind is cleared of cant "--Spring field Republican. $2.00 



Americanized 
Socialism 

BY JAMES MACKAYE 

We doubt if one 
intelligent person in 
ten could correctly 
define Socialism, 
Democracy, Syndi- 
calism, Direct Ac- 
tion, Anarchy, or 
anything else that 
today fires wide- 
awake imaginations. 
The Survey says: 
"With such an ex- 
cellent hand-book as 
'Americanized So- 
cialism' to guide 
him, even the mod- 
erately intelligent 
and very busy Am- 
erican has no excuse 
for the absolute 
lack of distinction 
between Socialism, 
I. W. W.ism, Bol- 
shevism, Syndical- 
ism, etc., that marks 
his mental inferior- 
ity to the moderate- 
ly intelligent and 
equally busy Euro- 



pean."

WHEN the leading progressive publishing house of France wanted a book 
about the new America they commissioned Waldo Frank to write it. 

We believe that no such all-embracing and magnificent attempt to inter- 
pret the development of a nation and its people has hitherto been made 
not by Lytton Strachey in his "Eminent Victorians" nor by Taine in his 
"English Literature," comparisons which only suggest. 

OUR AMERICA shows the need of the new generation to erect new social, 
spiritual structures laying bare as it does the decadent motives of our ma- 
terialistic pioneers. Here is a book ef our America, alive, articulate, stop- 
ping over barren New England hills, walking barefoot and unashemed 
through the Mississippi Valley, leaning over the rim of western mountains 
and looking into the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco. 



Arthur Henderson and other members of the British Labor Party, defeated for re-election 
immediately after the armistice, have been triumphantly returned to Parliament. British Labor 
almost paralyzed the transportation systems ef England. American Labor is demanding the 
adoption of the Plumb Plan and "walking out" in portentous numbers in steel mills, ship yards, 
etc., etc. Strike! Strike! Strike! is the stereotyped newspaper headline of today. Every em- 
ployer of labor, every social worker, every labor union official, every intelligent person, must be 
interested in the gigantic labor problems the world is now trying to solve. 

BRITISH LABOR AND THE WAR 

by PAUL U. KELLOGG (editor of The Survey) and Arthur Gleason, interprets conditions not 
only in England but in their application to America, in a sounder, mere illuminating way than 
any fije other books on the labor subject. BRITISH LABOR AND THE WAR is a book that 
should be bought today and read today, and read again in six months from now. It will be as 
timely and important then. It is strongly endorsed by such American and English publications 
as The New Republic, The Survey, The New York Evening Post, The Washington Star, The New 
Statesman, and The Manchester Guardian.

Here are Debs' 
own words spoken 
to Karsner in Atlan-

kind of book that 
time and history 
will require and in 
every line, in every 
page, you will be 
speaking for me 
with my authority 
given to you without 
reservations or 
qualifications." The 
book is replete with 
incident and anec- 
dote, humor and 
humanity. It can 
hardly fail to take 
its place with the 
great biographies 
and memoirs of the 
last few generations.

THE STRIVING ARMY OF DEMOCRACY 

Democracy has ever to keep its ceaseless vigil, ever to main- 
tain itself in battle order. Against it are arrayed the destruct- 
ive forces of reaction. 

It therefore behoves all lovers of liberty to be well armed 
for the fight. 

One of the most powerful attacks of the reactionaries against 
Democracy is directed through the press. 

Realizing its power, the forces of reaction have cast their bale- 
ful tentacles over the press, strangling free opinion. 

This form of attack must be countered by Democracy. 

Progressive Democracy must have organs that are not the 
shackled expounders of reactionary ideas. 






was founded one hundred years ago in 
the home of democracy and liberty. 

It is and always has been, associated 
in England with progressive movements. 
Never having been financed by any cap- 
italistic group, it has always withstood 
all attacks upon the liberty of its ex- 
pression. 



It has equally refused to be terrorized 
by mad-headed radicalism. 

THE WEEKLY EDITION 
will supply for American liberals accu- 
rate information about the fight for Lib- 
erty all over the world ; it gives uncolored 
battle intelligence from other fields of 
struggling democracy.

NEW APPLETON BOOKS 



By E. Temple Thurston 

The World of Wonderful Reality 

In his new novel, Mr. Thurston visualizes the passionate yearning in a girl's 
soul for love, truth and idealism as opposed to the sordid materialism of an every-day 
existence. It is a beautiful story with that magic touch of "faery" which recalls for 
a whole world the golden dreams of youth. Llewellyn Jones, in the Chicago Evening 
Post, says: "This book will be a big success. Mr. Thurston can really draw living 
people .... the salt of humor is never absent."

BOOKS BY THE LATE ERNST MACH 

A History of "THE SCIENCE OF MECHANICS." Translated by T. J. McCormack. Illus- 
trated. Cloth, $2.50. 

A new edition of one of the best books ever written on this subject. 
"Karl Pearson cited Mach's 'Mechanics' as the one book that had given him help and encouragement." 

POPULAR SCIENTIFIC LECTURES. Translated by T. J. McCormack. Illustrated. $1.50 

cloth; 60c. paper. 

A portrayal of the methods and spirit of science, in lectures on mechanics, sound, light, electricity, the 
conservation of energy, philosophy and education. The thoughts of the master-minds of science are here pre- 
sented in popular form by one of its foremost representatives. 

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE SENSATIONS. Translated by C. M. 

Williams. Cloth, $1.50. 

The author amplifies and brings up to date his original discussions on points of detail, and explains and 
justifies his more general views as to the relation between the different branches of science and to questions 
on the borderland feetween science and philosophy. Particular interest attaches to the explanations which 
he gives of the way in which his views were developed. 

"A wonderfully original little book. . . . Like everything he writes, a work of genius." Prof. William 
James. 

SPACE AND GEOMETRY in the Light of Physiological, Psychological and Physical In- 
quiry. Translated by T. J. McCormack. Cloth, $1.00. 

In most works on the foundations of geometry one point of view only is emphasized be it that of logic, 
epistemology, psychology, history, or the formal technology of the science here light is shed upon the sub- 
ject from all points of view combined, and the different sources from which spring the many divergent forms 
that the science of space has historically assumed, are thus shown forth with a distinctness and precision 
that in suggestiveness at least leave little to be desired. 

Any reader who possesses a slight knowledge of mathematics may derive from these essays a very ade- 
quate idea of the abtruse yet important researches of metageometry. 

THE HISTORY AND ROOT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSERVATION OF 
ENERGY. Translated by T. J. McCormack. Cloth, $125. 

This book is one of Mach's earliest and most stimulating writings and contains the germs of much of 
his later work. Moreover, it contains a reprint of much of his later work. Moreover, it contains a reprint 
of Mach's article of 1868 on the definition of mass, which is, perhaps, his most important contribution to 
mechanics; and the discussion of the logical root of the principle of the conservation of energy is fuller than 
that in any of his later publications. Several notes, explanatory, critical, or biographical, have been added 
by the translator, and the whole book has been revised by the author.

PROBLEMS OF SCIENCE 

By FEDERIGO ENRIQUES 

Translated by Katherine Royce, with an introduc- 
tion by Josiah Royce. 

Pp. 392, Cloth, Price $2.50. 

A scientific methodology with numerous refer- 
ences to contemporary interests and controversies. 

Professor Royce thinks that the book will be 
read with particular interest on account of the 
opposition that it offers to current "anti-intel- 
lectual" types of philosophizing.

siderable since Mill." The Nation. 



By AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN 
Cloth, $1.25 

Augustus De Morgan's three most important 
essays on the life and work of Newton have here 
been united, with many critical and bibliographical 
notes, in a single volume. These essays are very 
rare and are unknown to many of the historians 
of what is, perhaps, the most important period of 
English mathematics; and yet De Morgan's wide 
reading and broad-minded judgment have lost 
none of their value.

A SPINNER OF WEBS 

by Catherine Plumer Bement 

"Life in an American village is reproduced with photographic accuracy and often with 
consummate art in this tale. The scene is a hamlet on the Maine coast, so natural that it will 
make any visitor to that picturesque portion of New England think of the particular place 
where he has summered, and find many resemblances to the scenery he knows. The people 
are Down Easters, and some of them speak the dialect of that locality correctly; but the inci- 
dents and characters are such that they belong to any segregated American community. 

"It is a simple tale of commonplace events represented with a fidelity that makes it val- 
uable as a picture of American life. It is an interesting and well-done piece of work."

A FORTNIGHTLY 



Leonid Andreyev: 1871-1919 



BETWEEN THE TWO REVOLUTIONS of 1905 and 1917 
Leonid Andreyev was without a doubt the fore- 
most writer in Russia. His name was always spok- 
en with veneration, in mysterious whispers, as a 
grim portentous magician who descended into the 
ultimate depths of the nether side of life and fath- 
omed the beauty and tragedy of the struggle. 
Leonid Nickolayevich was born in the province of 
Oryol, in 1871, and studied law at the University 
of Moscow. Those were days of suffering and star- 
vation; he gazed into the abyss of sorrow and des- 
pair. In January 1894 he made an unsuccessful 
attempt to kill himself by shooting, and then was 
forced by the authorities to severe penitence, which 
augmented the natural morbidness of his tempera- 
ment. As a lawyer his career was short-lived, and 
he soon abandoned it for literature, beginning as a 
police-court reporter on the Moscow Courier. In 
1902 he published the short story In the Fog, which 
for the first time brought him universal recognition. 
He was imprisoned during the revolution of 1905, 
together with Maxim Gorky, on political charges. 
Such are tke few significant details of his personal 
life, for the true Andreyev is entirely in his stories 
and plays. 

Andreyev belongs to that great fellowship of 
Russian authors who did not accept the scientific 
advance of the century with its unquestioning ambi- 
tion and belief in the saving grace of mere action 
and work. An unflinching realist seeking truth with 
a terrible zeal, he divested things of their good na- 
ture and gloss, and his chosen themes were the fail- 
ure of the cultured man in the face of all-pervading 
coarseness, and the moral decay of middle-class 
correctness and order. At first he told himself 
that it was best to live without theories and mis- 
givings, and unheeding joy seemed the solution, 
which he expressed in There Was, In Springtime, 
On the River, A Present, Holiday, and others. 
"Neither truth nor falsehood will conquer," he then 
wrote; "only that will conquer which is in com- 
plete consonance with the foundation of life itself." 
But aloofnsss was foreign to his nature, and the 
themes which won undiminished ascendancy in his 
writings were the problems of man's solitude in 



the midst of conventional social life, his loneliness 
before inexplicable fate, and his eager yearning for 
human solidarity, for a moral not economic 
bond in human existence. In the everyday king- 
dom of mere things, in contact with our joyless 
existence and the adamantean wall of social cus- 
toms and falsehoods, he saw nothing but confusion, 
madness, death. Not life itself was terrible, but its 
debasement to- meaner ends, our fierce absorption 
in inconsequential aims and activities, and the em- 
ployment of intelligence in works that negate civi- 
lization, although presumptuously and solemnly 
undertaken to ameliorate and save. It was man's 
haughty belief in his power to be master of his 
fate, and of the dark mysterious forces compassing 
our life, that was the cause of confusion and 
madness. Pride of intellect, in the face of 
endless time and space, only increases man's de- 
solation and makes his ruin certain. Andreyev's 
lone-faring man saw reason overtopping itself, suf- 
ficiency and philistinism making a cursed waste 
of life where dreams of excellence are squandered 
in sin's distress, and his existence tended to with- 
draw from external activity and achievement deeper 
into the silences of mental life; in the place of am- 
bition, action, love, we have the tragedy of the 
intellect and the sufferings of lonely thought. This 
was the tragedy of his Dr. Kerzhentsev, who wanted 
by his intellect and will alone to span the abyss 
of doubt, committing a crime in the name of cul- 
ture. It is no less the tragedy of the gray little 
average man who revolts against the idea that he 
has no other destiny than to be a means of "gen- 
eral" happiness, a "social manure." Sergey Petro- 
vich would not enslave nor be enslaved, and so he 
dies, following the pitiless injunction of Zarathustra, 
"If thy life is not successful, if a venomous worm is 
gnawing at thy heart, know that death will succeed." 
A pessimist? True. But Andreyev does not end 
with pessimism. He was not the brilliant author 
toying with his changeful moods and fancies, but 
a fiery soul gripped by the world's sorrow, and see- 
ing visions of new worlds and beauty. By tempera- 
ment a man of combat, he yearned for a wider 
heaven and" real people. Denying life he yet

vibrates with love and sorrow of life, convinced that 
life is great, invincible. Refuting life, he believes 
in the symbol. The dying will thirsts for the impos- 
sible, looking for the miracle in the order of gloom 
and bestiality. Before the impenetrable Wall, 
against which are piled the dead of generations and 
ages, it is the leper who cries : "Let it stand. But is 
not each corpse a step to the summit? We are many, 
and our life is burdensome. Let us cover the earth 
with our bodies, body on body, and we shall reach 
the very summit. And if one of us should remain 
he will behold the new world." Here was faith 
within fear and confusion, a bugle call to action 
for the sake of one short shuddering step to the Un- 
seen, to the doorway of the new life; here was a 
sufficient answer to the question why struggle and 
die. Young revolutionary Russia heard the call. 
The mysticism which Andreyev accepted was not 
the comfort of an undisturbed faith, but a mystic- 
ism born out of great combat and striving, a mystic- 
ism of belief and asseveration. No wonder then that 
with the revolution of 1905 the cordial swiftness of 
Andreyev's art and his infinite love for the thwarted 
hopes and agonies of his people had completely 
captivated the imagination and the deep worship 
of his compatriots. No pessimist could have pro- 
duced in rapid succession the individual and social 
dramas which followed after 1905: To the Stars, 
Savva, King Hunger, Life of Man, and Anathema. 
In these Andreyev reached the acme of his poetic 
utterance. 

The light which was breaking through the gloom 
and confusion of Andreyev's early work was the 
conception of man as the son of eternity, a citizen 
of countless worlds, a sun-snarer. "Earth is wax 
in man's hands," cries the dreamy worker Treitch, 
in To the Stars, who would light a new sun with 
his own blood if the old were to go out. What if 
the noble and the beautiful spirits, like the stu- 
dent Nicholas, perish in the struggle? Man knows 
no death; the earth is full with his perfume. 
Treitch understands the old father astronomer who 
dreams of untrlangulated stars and "the mystery 
of things above us" where he discerns the birth of 
unknown friends "seven hundred years from now." 
Earth and sky join hands, revolutionist and astrono- 
mer are equally seekers through the dusk of struggle 
and failure for the living spark, to get where life, 
begins anew. And the astronomer sends Marie to 
die as Nicholas died, and he promises her immor- 
tality. To the stars! Work and combat on earth 
in the name of a wonderful dream. 

The revolutionary character unfolds itself fully 
in Sawa, the man who could not forgive all those 
who turned the world into "a cesspool, a slaughter- 



house." Savva came to sweep away the civiliza- 
tion of centuries and clear the way for great deeds, 
to give thought its wings. "It is necessary to strip 
the earth naked, Lippa," he cries to his sister; "to 
strip away all the hideous old rags! Earth is 
worthy of a royal mantle, but what have they done 
with her? She is dressed in coarse fustian, in 
prisoner's rags." He would sweep away all the 
past, all that imprisons man within the iron round 
of things already accomplished. Only the brave 
will remain, only those who will build up a new 
life, new beauty. Savva burns with a beautiful 
passion and a mad love for an ideal. He, too, is 
lonely; he loves only the society of children. But 
he too must perish, for life is a continuous process, 
and humanity an old man, refusing to be decom- 
pounded arid rebuilt to the linear utopianism of 
the dreamer and theorist, come out of the silence 
with his ideal to be foisted on unregenerate society. 
Old Kondraty thinks that man is sly, that he would 
hide and save something of the old order and then 
backslide into his former ways. With his sister 
Lippa, Andreyev cannot forget the unfortunate vic- 
tims: "No, Sawa, you don't love anyone. You 
love only yourself and your dreams. He who loves 
men will not take away from them all they love. 
He will not regard his own wishes more than their 
lives. Destroy everything! Destroy Golgotha? 
Consider: destroy Golgotha! The brightest, the 
most glorious hope that ever was on earth! All 
right, you don't believe in Christ. But if you have 
a single drop of nobility in your nature, you must 
respect and honor His noble memory. He also 
was unhappy. He was crucified crucified, Savva! 
You are silent?" 

Andreyev cannot forget the individual "speck of 
dust," our common brother who is demanded as 
a sacrifice to brotherhood. He tells many stories 
of the life of the ordinary "gray" men, souls lost 
and bewildered, and yet dreaming of excellence. 
He cannot reconcile himself to man doomed to 
nothing. In Life of Man we see him suffering for 
this gray man of the crowd. He chooses common 
incidents poverty, heedless pleasures of youth, 
ambition, rise to wealth, family happiness, dreams 
of home and big fireplaces, comfort at maturity, 
the loss of the only son, and man's bewilderment 
before misfortune and unknown fate. Impercepti- 
bly we begin to understand that the tragedy of the 
modern Individualist consists in his failure to re- 
late himself organically with the plangent life 
about him, to establish an immediate bond between 
himself and the larger social life, in the absence 
of which personal achievement hangs like a pall 
that shrouds dullness and vacancy.

But though the soul is lost, and the sick beast 
defiles man, he is reaching out for indissoluble 
truth. This is the eternal ageless reality so signifi- 
cant to Andreyev, for it is a power which flouts 
deformity and laughs at failure. This common 
concrete circumstance Andreyev traces out divinely 
on the walls of man's thought. He pursues this 
fateful idea of man thinking himself the center of 
the universe, demanding happiness and reason, 
while life goes on heedless of man's desires and 
sufferings, until he creates the symbols Anathema 
and King Hunger, spirits which at once despise and 
love man, suffering for him, betraying him, and 
striving to cast the chaos of life into some mold 
of rational conscious will. Anathema is modern 
and orig'nal. Not Milton's reason rising against 
God, nor Byron's fallen spirit of romantic daring 
and protest, nor the cold, calculating, disdainful 
spirit of Goethe's creation; Anathema is "gray," 
cautious and bold, lying and yet truthful, ambitious, 
loving work and fame, seeking justice and eternity. 
He is the "devil" of an oppressed and enslaved in- 
dustrial people; self-confident reason struggling 
towards happiness and truth. Anathema is in 
science only in numbers, weight, and measure; 
in a word, a modern parvenu. He would prove to 
the Guardian at the Gate in heaven that misery is 
eternal, man worthless, and compassion futile. The 
poor Jew David should be the test. Anathema 
brings millions to David, and David goes forth to 
give joy to all men. The masses come to him "like 
four oceans of tears," he gives them everything until 
he is poor again, and when he is powerless to 
satisfy the unending poverty of the earth, he would 
try a m'racle only to give them happiness. He de- 
ceives their hopes and expectations, and David, who 
was ready to squeeze his heart "like a sponge be- 
tween the m llstones of his palms," perishes at their 
hands. Love and compassion end in hatred and 
death. But in spite of the great evil done, the 
Guardian at the Gate affirms the deathlessness of 
love. David is immortal. "He lives in the im- 
mortality of fire which is life." Anathema, who 
is numbers and measures, cannot understand. A 
tragic solution this the failure and the immortal- 
ity of David. But is Andreyev wrong? Has love 
ever vanquished by mere giving of wealth away? 
Has Christianity won by the mere surrendering of 
the two coats? David was only a philanthrop'st, 
a poor man after all. Love does not bind men this 
way, and money charity does not make society one 
and organic. Riches only stirred in David the fear 
of death whom he waited as a friend when he was 
poor. David has no essential beauty. Neverthe- 
less this moral outgoing of man, spanning the 



chasm between self and the world, is precious. 
Truth saves mankind. Truth is immortal in David, 
in man's emotional yearning for man, but truth 
must perish in Anathema, who is numbers and 
measures. 

King Hunger appeared at a moment of universal 
desperat on when the defeat of the revolutionary 
movement produced a state of chaos in the life and 
literature of Russia. Andreyev seized the spirit 
of the desperate condition of the struggle, the tragic 
spirit of rebellion among the peasants, and the 
monstrosity of a spiritually barren class in a posi- 
tion of power. The dramatic pictures of King 
Hunger reveal the masterful broad strokes of a 
great artist's brush. We feel the presence of Sty- 
gian shadows; they waver, fading into transparent 
colossal shapes, incomprehensible and gruesome as 
the figures of Time, Death, and King Hunger. We 
hear earth groaning, we hear the weep'ng of her 
children. The despotic power of the machine 
crushes the life and blood of the earth and her fair 
children. Time is waiting for man to grow indig- 
nant and to revolt. King Hunger knows that nature 
is gathering her gigantic force to hurl into oblivion 
the whole burden of false, man-destroying culture, 
its shames and lies, and the arrogance of privilege. 
This releasing force is both the revolution and the 
inauguration of the new world. Not unlike destiny, 
playing with social forces, King Hunger, is dual 
in nature. He is lackey and leader. He -fawns on 
the rich, their pride and over-confidence in per- 
petuating themselves in power; he instigates the 
underworld of thieves, paupers, .strumpets the 
legitimate counterpart of the mercantile order 
to murder, violence, and destruction. Among tli; 
laborers, in the factory, he appears as leader. He 
sees their unceasing toil without beginning or end, 
he hears their demands for joy and life, he feels 
the reserve power of great spirits and their inarticu- 
late cries, and he calls them to revolt. "Let us give 
back to man his might and beauty! Let's fling him 
again into the torrent of infin'te motion!" Man 
must cease to be the thrall of the machine. Only 
free man can live in joy of life; only such can love; 
only love proclaims itself in pure artistic impulses 
and creative thought. 

Into this fanta.stic struggle of soc'al forces An- 
dreyev projected the dark mood of The Girl in 
Black. She represents the best and noblest instincts 
of the ruling classes, who, confronted with a dread- 
ful social overthrow, and exhausted under the pres- 
sure of historic evolution, blindly strive to live with 
their backward faith. She cannot merge herself with 
the hopes and struggles of the masses, her princely 
offering of sympathy is spurned, but she would not 



428 



THE DIAL 



November 15 



"laugh at the fallen." The cruelty and cynicism 
of her class exasperate her. She feels that their 
greed and malice have produced delusions and mon- 
sters. Moving in a class which can no longer fight 
for its power as an icjeal, s he can only advise them 
"to meet death dancing," to die beautifully. She 
knows that the growing solidarity of the toiling 
masses will end all passive submission to the myth 
of authority. Her mood of defeat seizes the ruling 
class on the night of the great revolt, when hope 
rebounds oh the barricades and the prophecy of 
Cassandra rings in the air. They can only see 
"shaggy, half-naked monsters" in revolt, slaying 
women and children, burning libraries and art 
galleries. She and her class can only hear voices 
roaring revenge and poison. Deceived by the im- 
mediate utterances of indignation, blind to the 
deeper and nobler instincts demanding a worthy 
share in the joys of life whose physical sustenance 
shall no longer exhaust man's forces in weary serv- 
ice, she and her class mistake the true nature of the 
great upheaval. But "I am not Stephano, but a 
cramp." She and her class are the "cramp" of the 
social revolution. 

The revolt is drowned in blood. The devourers 
of the people triumph. But is there not another 
King, not King Hunger? In the factory scene, one 
workingman demands sternly, "To go to freedom 
over violence?" He believes in another King, but 
does not know his name. He is young and daring, 
consumptive, and thinks that a new world will 
blossom on his blood. The picture of collective 
man at work, creating, is not found in Andreyev: 
he lacked enthusiasm and the strength of a soul 



willing to give itself to those who blunderingly but 
earnestly labor for a larger life. Andreyev was 
not the man to reveal the subterranean ideas and 
passions generating within life itself. He was never 
the conscience of Russia, with lips touched by divine 
living fire, as Tolstoy was, but the mood of Russia, 
falling and rising with the dreams and hopes of 
the struggle. 

In 1905 the revolt was blind and elemental, and 
apparently without constructive force. It was a 
trial of strength. But the young consumptive work- 
ingman, and Andreyev's mood, look forward to a 
King yet to come. They have faith in the final 
victory; they feel that the human race, like Chek- 
hov's Cherry-Tree Garden, though blasted for a 
while, will bloom again in the end. The powers 
f evil will die, poisoned by their own crimes and 
greed. A new order will be born. The working- 
men of Andreyev are different from Hauptmann's 
weavers; they do not demolish machines, cut belts, 
quench boilers. They have no hatred of persons 
and machines. Hunger leads them to collective 
solidarity and consciousness. Mutilated and decim- 
ated, they will conquer in the end, rising on their 
dead selves, from the tears and sweat and blood of 
the torment. The dead field, of the last scene, 
strewn with the bodies of the perished and slain, 
the field on which the victors laugh and jeer at the 
fallen, breathes lasting defiance and resistance. A 
thousand-strong murmur rises on the dead field, 
the voice of the united armies of labor: "We shall 
yet come! We shall yet come! Woe to the victori- 
ous!" And the victors run. The 'dead are rising.

White devils who have not

Upon their skins. 

Faces where snob and harlequin 

Ogle each other in two, cold colors, 

White and red;

Faces where emotions 

Stand disarmed within a calm mirage; 

These faces bend over paper 

And steal from you a little silver and red 

So that "their lives may seem to bleed 

Under the prick of a flashing need. 



The old and tired smile 

Of one who spies too much within himself 

To spare the effort of a halting frown, 

Brushed its scepter over your face. 

You gave kind eyes to your hope, 

Desiring it to grope unfearing 

Underneath the toppling mountain-tops. 

The wine you drank was a lake 

In which you splashed and found a vigor; 

The wine you drank was void of taste. 

Your yellow skin resembled 

A balanced docility 

Smiling at all things even at itself 

Li T'ai Po.

Maximalists and Minimalists in Italy 



THE VOTE TAKEN at the closing of the con- 
gress at Bologna on October 10, the Italian Social- 
ist Party passes to the extreme left. On the reso- 
lutions drawn respectively by the right and the 
left the show of hands was overwhelmingly in 
favor of the latter. In view of this, the minority 
factions consented to intervene in the executive 
committee only in a consultative fashion, leaving 
unanimous control to the sovietist elements. On 
the question of participation in the imminent elec- 
tions, three groups developed: the abstentionists, 
led by Bordiga; the societists, led by Lazzari, who 
favors participation in the present instance; and 
the traditional parliamentarians, led by Treves. 
The second of these parties prevailed. As a result 
of this decision, the Italian Soviet is now insti- 
tuted, with elements devoted to insurrectionist tac- 
tics and having revolution as their immediate ob- 
jective. "Before this action," comments a con- 
servative writer, "the Fiume problem pales into 
insignificance." It is indeed possible that "Bo- 
logna, 1919" will have as important a place in 
the history of Italian Socialism as that enjoyed 
for the past twenty-six years by "Genoa, 1892." 
Meanwhile the General Federation of Labor an- 
nounces that the policy adopted by the Socialists 
at Bologna will not cause any change in its own 
traditional attitude. This helps to clarify as well 
as to complicate the Italian situation, which would 
seem to be now moving toward a fairly permanent 
stabilization. 

To put this action of the Socialist Party in its 
historical perspective, we may venture to recall 
that the founder of Italian Socialism was not Marx 
but Bakunin. The Italian populace, with cen- 
turies of political tyranny behind it, had native 
to it that hatred of the state and of all types of 
bureaucracy which was one of Bakunin's dis- 
tinctive emotions. Marxism, with its concept of 
an organ : zed society, made in the earliest years 
of Socialism only a gradual advance in Italy. 
While Bakuninism passed to the minority in the 
first International, as early as 1872, and was ex- 
cluded from the second International on the 
foundation of the latter in 1889, the corresponding 
evolution was not complete in Italy till the Genoa 
Congress of 1892, when the Italian Socialist Party 
came into being and Italian Marxian Socialism 
became clearly distinguished from anarchistic 
jepublicanism. 

Between 1892 and 1906 Italian Socialism was 



in much the state of mind that still predominates 
in the American movement. The party contained, 
first of all, those who thought that common owner- 
ship of the essentials to life could be attained 
through the eapture by ballot of the instrumentali- 
ties of the modern democratic state; and second, 
those who thought that Socialism could be insti- 
tuted only by the development of the trades unions, 
the triumph of which would involve the disappear- 
ance of the present democratic state and the crea- 
tion of a new organism integrating political and 
economic power in the hands of the workers. 

Here we find the cleavage between Reformist and 
Revolutionary Socialism, which had been fully de- 
veloped in Italy by 1906. In that year majority 
control in the Italian party passed to the latter of 
these groups. Italian Socialism became definitely 
syndicalistic and revolutionary, and linked up, 
in a close relationship that has lasted ever since, 
with the General Federation of Labor, founded in 
1900. In 1907 it was recognized that the prin- 
ciple of collective ownership, shared in common 
by Reformists and Revolutionaries, was not broad 
enough to accommodate syndicalist action and 
exclusively political action in a single efficient or- 
ganization. Enrico Ferri, the leader of the demo- 
cratic political aetienists, left the party. The 
expulsion of Mr. Bissolati in 1913 was only an echo 
of this same difficulty a new secession which drew 
off into the Reformist Socialist Party, for the elec- 
tion purposes of that time, the elements, really 
reformistic in conviction, who had hesitated for 
one reason or another to forsake the rich supply 
of votes delivered to the Socialist emblem by the 
General Federation. 

At the outbreak of the world war the socialistic 
and revolutionary movement in Italy presented the 
following picture. The old Bakunin group, shed 
by the Socialist Party in 1892, stood organized 
with about 100,000 members in the Syndicalist 
Union, centralized in the "red" province of 
Romagna and fighting for the system of anarchistic 
republics which was temporarily proclaimed in 
June 1914. 

The Reformists, dropped in 1907 and 1913, were 
hovering on the right of the Parliamentary group 
with about twenty-five deputies, led by Mr. Bis- 
solati and Mr. Berenini, and combining as often 
with the Radicals and Liberals as with the majority 
Socialists. 

Forming the vanguard of Socialism was the alii-

ance constituted by the General Federation of 
Labor, numbering 400,000 in 1913, and the Italian 
Socialist Party, counting 37,000 active members 
and polling almost exactly a million votes in the 
total of eight millions cast in the elections of that 
year. The war caused one slight abrasion on the 
surface of this solid group, when a few intellectuals 
of the type of Mr. Mussolino, and a few revolu- 
tionary workers like Mr. Alceste De Ambris, ex- 
perienced a revival of patriotism and nationalistic 
sentiment. In the same plane with the General 
Federation we have had since last year the Italian 
Labor Union, exhibiting a compound of national- 
ism and syndicalism, while the Italian Socialist 
Party has a rival in the Socialist Union, of which 
one faction is following the moribund Wilsonism 
of Mr. Bissolati, while another is riding on the 
nationalist band-wagon in the trail of D'Annunzio. 

Now as for the central nucleus of Italian So- 
cialism, which carries on the unbroken tradition 
originated in 1892, and which was united with the 
labor movement in 1906, it is important to note 
that the Socialist party has grown since the war 
to a membership in excess of 100,000, while the 
Federation has also tripled in size, reaching a 
strength of not less than a million and a quarter. 
But this powerful agglomeration of revolutionary 
energy is a unit only in its ultimate ideal the 
seizure by the syndicates of the instruments of pro- 
duction and consequently of political power. It 
is divided by important differences as to tactics 
and strategy, which are indeed not so great nor so 
incompatible with each other as was the old cleav- 
age between Reformists and Revolutionaries. That 
is why the revolutionary Socialist organism has not 
split on the issue of Bolshevism. 

The terminology distinguishing the two most im- 
portant tendencies in the Italian movement in- 
cludes the words "maximalism" and "minimalism." 
These terms are not so expressive as the words 
"sovietism" and "productionism," which are be- 
coming current in France. Let us hazard a state- 
ment of the opposing views of the groups com- 
monly called the "left" and the "right" a state- 
ment all the more necessary in the United States 
in view of the somewhat different tendencies which 
developed at the Chicago convention. 

The Maximalist (Sovietist) holds that the work- 
man is the only producer, while the capitalist is a 
parasite. For the Minimalist (Productionist) , the 
worker is not the only producer: he is not able to 
invent, design or set up his machinery, nor to find 
markets for his products; therefore the technical 
expertness of the capitalist class must be conserved 
and utilized. 



The Maximalist thinks that the worker has no 
interest, at present, in his output. Increased pro- 
duction means more strength to the employers and 
tighter bonds on the workingman. Reforms de- 
press revolutionary morale by arousing false hopes 
and preventing the general despair essential to the 
success of revolution. In the view of Minimalist, 
any measure that Increases output is so much gained 
by the worker. He learns how to manage his ma- 
chinery better and what efficient production under 
good conditions of labor is. Not despair but tech- 
nical efficiency on the part of the working classes is 
the first prerequisite to a revolutionary period. 

For the Maximalist, the revolution is a political 
cataclysm. After seizing political power at what- 
ever cost in suffering and retrogression, the workers 
can begin to reconstruct and acquire their own 
technical efficiency. For the Minimalist, the revo- 
lution is viewed as an economic evolution. A revo- 
lution resulting in famine and suffering will pro- 
duce reaction and result in failure. 

The Maximalist recognizes that the main body of 
labor is conservative. Therefore the revolution 
must be the violent act of a small body of con- 
vinced enthusiasts, which will "start something" 
and either sweep the majority into like enthusiasm 
or intimidate it into acquiescence. For the Mini- 
malist, such enthusiasts cannot be trusted e ther 
to be successful in seizing power or to use that 
power wisely after they may have secured it. 

The Maximalist thinks the masses can be con- 
trolled by dictatorship, just as the capitalistic sys- 
tem controls them now. The Minimalist fears that 
violence will provoke a mass assault by the mili- 
tarized majority on the revolutionary minority, with 
the extermination of the revolutionists as a result. 
The workers must therefore gradually and per- 
sistently force their way into the control of the 
economic p'ower in their regions, cooperating with 
government and owners until able to dispense with 
both. 

For the Maximalist, participation by the revolu- 
tionists in the work of the existing parliamentary 
system demoralizes the participants and inhibits 
violent action. For the Minimalist, such coopera- 
tion enables the revolutionist to weaken the action 
of the government against the revolution, hastens 
the granting of necessary advantages, and facili- 
tates the advance of the workers to complete 
control. 

Now to draw a contrast that may serve to en- 
lighten the somewhat complex situation in Italy: 
while the French Confederation generale du- 



1919 



THE DIAL

Travail has a large majority in favor of the Pro- 
ductionist or Minimalist program, with Sovietism 
or Maximalism in a minority that seems to be 
diminishing, and is captained by intellectuals and 
unskilled laborers, the Italian Federation takes no 
positive stand on the issues between left and right. 
There has been no. occasion for a recorded division 
on this question, but it seems clear that out-and-out 
Minimalism is favored only by a relatively small 
minority, while Maximalism itself has never been 
able to muster more than a thirty per cent vote. 
Between these extremes stand the majority of the 
workers, who represent, not a compromise between 
left and right, but a hesitancy to accept either. 
The Federation was ready in July to make the 
effort to save Russia. It did not care to try the 
venture without a guarantee of support from Eng- 
land and France. It stands ready now to make 
an effort all alone, should the Fiume venture throw 
the army and middle-class organization into chaos. 
Certainly this would indicate a tendency toward 
Maximalism. 

This situation explains the action of the Socialist 
party at Bologna. Whether the party go to the 
left or to the right is of little moment, unless it 
carries the Federation with it. Considered apart 
from the labor organization, the Socialist party is, 
in the words of Turati, "a mere abstraction." As 
the Federation itself put it, "the Federation can 
never assume a subordinate role in the alliance be- 
tween party and Federation." But the Federation 
"stands pat" on the traditional Minimalist or Pro- 
ductionist program framed by its leaders and not 
yet put to the direct test of a vote under after-war 
conditions. The Socialist party constitutes itself 



as the soviet and volunteers to offer the enthusiasm 
which will sweep the masses into insurrection and 
revolution. 

Will it succeed? Does it wish even to succeed? 
Is the new direction the party has taken indicative 
of a permanent reversal of policy, or is it simply 
a propagandist expedient adapted to the moment? 
No one, apparently, pretends to know, and time 
only can tell. Turati says that "the experiment 
decided on by the Socialist congress must be car- 
ried out with perfect freedom of action and with 
undivided support from all factions." It is the 
skepticism of the old campaigner who suddenly 
finds himself crowded into the background by the 
sudden elevation to command of inexperienced but 
sanguine lieutenants. Turati, however, has never 
been able to differentiate between the Maximalism of 
1918 and the Bakuninism of 1890. And there is a dif- 
ference in goal, in spite of near identity in tactics. 
It is possible to understand the regret of the older 
leaders when they see the Italian Socialist party 
abandon policies which have made it the greatest 
single influence for good in the Italian democracy 
of the past quarter-century. But there is unques- 
tionably much that is hopeful in the present out- 
look. The action at Bologna shows that the Italian 
party is still vital and aggressive strong enough 
to disagree with itself. It brings the Italian nation 
sharply to order at the moment when the lure of 
romantic adventures overseas is strongest. It is an 
impressive act of solidarity with Russia at a time 
when that beleaguered nation is most in need of 
encouragement. 

ARTHUR LIVINGSTON. 



The Roaring Forties 



T 



HAT IS CLEARLY EVIDENT in Mr. Ralph D. 

Paine's narrative The Qld Merchant Marine (The 
Chronicles of America; Yale University Press), is 
that, before beginning it, he was opposed by an 
almost insuperable difficulty. The chronicle, a rec- 
ord of events in their absolute order, without com- 
ment or art, while it serves well enough the sim- 
plicity of early romance, is entirely incapable of 
even indicating the rise of a great period, its dom- 
ination, practically, of a world, and, for a mul- 
tiplicity of causes, its decline and end. This, sat- 
isfactorily related, requires either limitless space 
or a great art; and forbidden, evidently, the for- 
mer, Mr. Paine has not brought the other rare 
gift to his undertaking. 



The trouble, certainly, with his book is that 
he has permitted his own preferences and admira- 
tions to dominate practically every chapter; and, 
although his sympathetic knowledge of our mer- 
chant marine is deep, although he has faithfully 
followed its logs of voyage, he is first drawn to 
the more obvious romance: here he loves, above 
everything, the flash of a cutlass; he sees most 
vividly not the old barques feeling their way about 
Africa by the color of a current, but privateersmen 
lashed bulwark to bulwark with heavier metal and 
firing with indomitable courage their last car- 
ronade. 

This is evident not only in his choice of inci- 
dents, but in words; he loves, as well, just such 



432 



THE DIAL 



phrases as carronade; the third chapter of The 
Old Merchant Marine is called Out Cutlasses and 
Board; his pages echo with the trumpeted cry, 
"Strike, or I'll sink you with a broadside!"; the 
swaggering pirate traditionally chews wine-glasses; 
there is shower after shower of round shot and 
bars of iron, engagement after engagement under 
the very cliffs of England, stabbing and shooting 
amid yells and huzzas. It is all as gallant as pos- 
sible, a stirring affair frm first to last; but un- 
fortunately aside from the veritable magic, the 
spirit, of the early trading ventures. 

Yet Mr. Paine's book is eminently fair and 
widely informed; in detail it is uncommonly accu- 
rate. To be sure he has spread where only moon- 
sails belong watersails and ringtails above the 
skysails; while the ringtail is a jib-shaped sail set 
abaft the spanker, the watersail under the swinging 
boom. But this is relatively unimportant. A 
large amount of reading, the preparations for the 
other books allied in subject, lies behind The Old 
Merchant Marine and makes it both authentic and 
valuable. The chapter on The Packet Ships could 
hardly be better. And, in its entity, it is a courage- 
ous presentation of the truth about our whalers 
and merchant marine in the face of a contrary 
British legend: this, in reality, being that we had 
faster ships better served than England, our mas- 
ters, throughout the great period, and were far 
superior to the English. 

. Mr. Paine establishes these facts by overwhelm- 
ing evidence drawn from actual performance, com- 
parison, and English sources; and he shows back 
of that the fundamental causes of American su- 
premacy on the sea. The necessities of physical 
situation, enormous natural resources, the spirit 
of a new land, produced as he so justly says 
the finest full ships of all time, lovelier, except 
for cathedrals, than anything else created by man. 

He makes plain, too, the long involved diplo- 
matic and political jealousies and blindness that 
hampered American shipping at home and away. 
Frequently this was a means of more notable ac- 
complishment: restricted in easier lanes, Salem 
ship-masters carried their house-flags into the 
farthest straits and ports, returning with incredible 
riches; but, in the end, shackling treaties and Con- 
gressional bargaining, time itself, left the little 
brigs and ships, the packets and towering clippers, 
idle at their cob-built or solid wharfs. 

In the pressure of his predilections, however, 
Mr. Paine has thrown overboard for his cutting 
out expeditions and boarding parties a romance, 
a courage, far surpassing the bullying clatter of 
steel. After all, a book called The Old Merchant 



Marine has for its subject the epic of trade and 
not of wars. In, for example, the chapter Yankee 
Vikings and New Trade Routes, while there is a 
great deal about the first, and a conventional paste 
of patriotism and mutineers, there is nothing actu- 
ally of the routes. The cannon are again in action; 
but the strange beauty of uncharted seas and 
islands, the extraordinary cargoes of sea-horses' 
teeth and beche-de-mer, lacquers and longcloth and 
amber, is quite absent. 

Beyond slight references to China, to tea, the 
mere terms Sumatra and pepper, nothing is told. 
It is more important, more impressive, to learn 
that there was no anchorage whatever at Sumatra 
that the ships lay off the pounding surf while 
their masters, with a rack of muskets in the long 
boat, negotiated with the native datoo supported 
by a show of poisoned creeses than to listen to 
the tale of the whaler Betsy coming safely out of 
harbor under the guns of Spanish forts. It is 
more enthralling to picture the tea ships, the 
frigate-built East Indiamen with their captains in 
gold lace and bluff American vessels often under 
two hundred tons' burden, lying side by side in 
Whampoa Reach while their masters went up the 
river to bargain with the co-hongs of Canton, than 
to read of a prancing midshipman with a elirk. 

What about the trading barques of the East 
African Coast? What about the West Coast? 

From which did the frails of dates come, the 
palm oil, ivory, gold dust, gum copal? There 
are detailed paragraphs about unimportant affairs 
with Japan, trivialities of description. But when 
was Shanghai opened to American bottoms? What 
were the difficulties of trade with Dutch Java? 
How, during a stormy period of interminable 
strife, were voyages and ports constantly shifted 
to avoid the ruthless confiscation of entire cargoes? 
What, actually, were those rare scented exports 
from fabulous lands? How did they look broken 
out of holds on the Salem water-side? 

The indigo, of Calcutta or Manila, was boxed in 
cases of dusty blocks six inches square, and a hun- 
dred or two such cases, valued at a hundred dol- 
lars each, made a characteristic shipment; pepper, 
in the earlier days when it was still a direct cargo, 
was carried in bulk, the vessels drew away from 
western Sumatra with the between-decks, the boats 
above, the cabins literally overflowing; the cassia 
buds of Singapore were powdered, but the bark 
arrived in heavy plaited mats; the fine teas the 
first picking from the Sunglo and Black Hills 
were contained in little leaden cannisters. . . . 
Such things not only form the fragrant romance 
of Mr. Paine's subject, they are the subject itself,

its shape and substance and value and being. 

What, too, were the weights and measures, the 
monetary exchanges, of the .old merchant marine: 
what is a picul, a frail? Why were Spanish dol- 
lars, in kegs, universal for American trading? 
How, in their preliminary turn, were they con- 
tracted for and procured? And what, finally, 
about the ports and new routes? 

Sauger Island with the tigers roaming under its 
light, Papatee in the heavenly calm of Point Venus, 
the Hoogly River and Malacca Straits, with an 
American shipmaster on his deck for sixteen days, 
the withheld eastings of inhuman southern lati- 
tudes and winds! How were the courses laid why 
did a ship make the British Isles before bearing 
away, by way of South America, for the Cape 
of Good Hope, the Indian Ocean and the East? 
How was the one, the two or three years of a voy- 
age consumed? . . .A Salem vessel might 
make Bermuda Hundred, on the James River, for 
tobacco, discharge that at her home port, ship lum- 
ber and cotton to South America, carry hides and 
rubber on to Madeira for wine, bear that to the 
Isle de France, proceed, by way of Bombay and 
its printed chintzes to the Feejees for a fantastic 
collection of delicacies offered to the Chinese palate 
in exchange for Shantung silks and porcelains. So 
much Mr. Paine has ignored. 



There is the necessity, as well, of adding that 
the bibliography of The Old Merchant Marine is 
hardly more than perfunctory, a curious omission 
in view of Mr. Paine's unquestioned knowledge of 
his sources. There is no notice of the Augustine 
Heard Memoir, nor of the George Nichols volume, 
both of inestimable value; his reference to Cap- 
tain Richard Cleveland takes no account of the 
fact that Harpers issued in 1886 a comprehensive 
description of him by H. W. S. Cleveland called 
Voyages of a Merchant Navigator. The remark- 
able collections of the Essex Institute, manuscript 
logs and valuable casual papers, the actualities of 
the Peabody Museum, are not indicated. 

To be complete sudh a bibliography must in- 
clude, perhaps, three hundred titles, English and 
French, contemporary and retrospective: Shang- 
hai almanacs and sailors' journals, opening with 
an invocation to God and blistered with the salt 
spray of their daring, books on Chinese behavior, 
with dusty lithographs of ingenious tortures, charts 
with Neptune, clasping his Triton, rising from the 
sea works of unalloyed superstition slowly de- 
veloping into an assured art of navigation; New 
England village annals, Admiralty law, coinage, 
food, dress. . . . But this would necessitate an 
infinity of interests together with a spaciousness of 
scope denied, in its exact sense, to any mere 

chronicle. T TT

I 



Our Unique Humorist Artemus Ward 



N A CREDITABLE VOLUME Artemus Ward: A Biog- 
raphy and Bibliography (Harper) Mr. Don C. 
Seitz fails to give us any distinct idea of the celebri- 
ty who, living from 1834 to -1867, was Charles Far- 
rar Browne and called himself "Artemus Ward." 
This is no fault of the biographer, not only be- 
cause he never saw his subject but because the des- 
criptions of the many who did see and know him al- 
most equally miss conveying just what this pleas- 
ant creature was like. All notably successful plat- 
form individualities being highly peculiar to them- 
selves, even contrastive one with another, most of 
their effect, their self -impression, unreproducible at 
second hand, vanishes with their mortal passing, as 
with great jury lawyers, politicians, actors, pulpit- 
eers. 

Yet rambling through this book and his writings, 
one occasionally perhaps glimpses if not grasps the 
bubbling idiosyncrasy of the person. Long ago, 
a gentle codger of an Irish-English poet delighted 
to devise and hum such things as "Good people all, 
of every sort, Give ear unto my song, And. if you 



find it wondrous short, It cannot hold you long;" 
the plot here being that a dog went mad and bit a 
human, wherefore "sure the dog had lost his wits 
to bite so good a man." Yes, Artemus Ward flavors 
of this mood of Noll's. Both exceedingly de- 
lighted Ward among other spontaneous absurdi- 
ties to enforce the obvious as if it were a prime 
point to make, ' and they were so circumstantial 
about it that they wrought no end of simple humor 
and good-humor. It is true that Goldsmith was a 
writer only. The American's best wit and whimsey 
were spoken. "In the midst of life we are in debt; 
Rat jump over a trunk; I am saddest when I sing 
and so are others" such colloquial morsels must 
have dropped more movingly from the utterer's lips 
than they could, did, or do lie in his printed ink. 
Notwithstanding that the weary Lincoln read this 
laugher's broad grotesque skits with fondness and 
for relief, and that Artemus mounted to the plat- 
form from the considerable editorship of the New 
York Vanity Fair as the successor of Leland, he 
had no sustained literary powers, such as Mark

Twain's, whose first publishings he godfathered. 
Of their similar humors Mark Twain's is much the 
more robust; Ward's was sweeter. Nothing harsh, 
nothing so hard as a sarcasm, can be found among 
his "goaks," as it was one of his jokes to spell the 
word. A rational being who gloated all over like 
an infant or idiot in such trivial perversions was 
a wholesomely exquisite effervescer. We must cor- 
rect our received impressions that his humor strokes 
fell in whacks and bricks. His latitudes in ap- 
proaching a point were sometimes wild, and his 
rocking auditory wildly laughed in answer, but it 
did not hullabaloo and yell. Inordinate hailing 
could not greet such elegant feeling as the genius 
evinced when one night snow-bound in the chill 
chamber of a remote Maine inn. The closets were 
ransacked for extra bed cover but nothing better 
*.ame to light than the frame of a hoop-skirt of the 
Jate. Artemus hung it in the window. "It will 
keep out," he shuddered to his companion, "the 
coarsest of the cold." 

The man perpetually enjoying himself and all 
others, eminently Negroes and children, made 
friends wherever he turned or passed. New Eng- 
land, towns, Cleveland, New York, Baltimore, New 
Orleans, Boston, and their wits, all knew and cher- 
ished him as paragrapher, companion, and pseudo- 
lecturer. In war days in Memphis he captivated 
General Sherman, who abhorred most newspaper 
people. When a San Francisco theater manager 
telegraphed, "What would you take for forty nights 
in California?" Artemus replied "Brandy and 
ttater," which pleased Bret Harte along with every- 
body else on the Coast. No drunkard, his endless 
frolic and conviviality began to undermine the 
phthisical constitution of that tall frail frame when 
in Utah, where he was gathering notes for his Mor- 
mon "lecture" after an ebullient California visit, 
all in 1863. His brief career in England was amaz- 
ingly brilliant. He was seized into the bosom of the 
inceptive Savage Club, which he "made" and where 
remains his bust by Grekowski ; was landed by Mark 
Lemon to write for Punch, and met overpowering 
popularity with his Mormon lecture. A Mr. Mill- 
ward and his wife there in London took good 
care of the reckless liver and Mrs. Millward 
warned him that he must learn to say no, so one 
small-hour morn'ng Artemus roused the house to 
report to Mrs. Millward gravely that (manifestly 
not acting in kind) he had been saying no all the 
evening. He went to pieces and swiftly died of his 
consumption at Southampton at thirty-three, acutely 
mourned at Kensal Green Cemetery by a crowd of 
English and Ameri9an friends alike. Moncure Con- 



way, whom he had known in Cincinnati when him- 
self editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, buried 
him. His body was removed to repose in the Elm 
Vale Cemetery of his native Wateriord, in Maine. 

So far from a buffoon, described in fact by every- 
body as gentlemanly, his ungainly appearance 
gauntly lent itself to the solemn manners of his 
fun. Mark Twain likened his figure to a glove- 
stretcher, and his face was aquiline to match. He 
never smiled on the platform, delivering with diffi- 
dent hesitations and a drawl those outrages of 
reason which made his houses roar and scream. But 
however suddenly, while casually, he served masses 
of the preposterous, or whatever he dropped of 
shocking Impossibilities of exaggeration, the loud 
mirth he compelled was not gross or roystering, 
but finer; it relaxed dignity, his own and his hear- 
ers', to free joy, but the dignity if only the Chap- 
lin and his party would make a note of it was not 
dispelled. The wonderful humorist, as Conway re- 
lates, "played on his audience as Liszt did on a 
piano." Charles Reade called him "Artemus the 
Delicious." 

For Browne's originality possessed a qual- 
ity impossible to analyze or acquire, charm; 
and it resided in his own air, but little of it, as 
already considered, filtering through his inditing 
fingers into Artemus Ward: His Book, or his other 
volumes. His letters spontaneous pennings keep 
more of his self. In one of them he expressed what 
light virtue of philosophy streaked his irresponsible 
courses: "I have always meant the creatures of my 
burlesques should stab Error and give Right a 
friendly push." At Salt Lake City, where he assayed 
Mormonism as "petticoats and plunder," he re- 
gretted an unjealous plural wife's saying, though 
interestingly: "Man is a part of God, and when 
man belongs to the Church the image of God is in 
him; he loses his selfishness, becomes like God, 
and can love many." 

He was viceless and unmean, and so pure-minded 
that in the good fellowships of which he was al- 
ways the center, among men of gifts or shirted 
miners, the jollity never lurched into the ditch of 
smuttiness. He called his mother by her name, 
Caroline, and it was the last thought and act of 
his life to provide for her. His existence was ap- 
parently unvisited by despondenc'es. Reflections 
of a curious pathos of lack dawn from that; from 
that and with the realization that not in any ren- 
dered line of his or his biographer's, or under it, is 
there ray or shadow of a love that ever suffused and 
troubled this delicate bright spirit.

L HEN," SAID THE CAPTAIN, "I shot him again 
to make sure." And he proudly exhibited a helmet 
bored through with two diminutive holes two steel 
blossoms with curling lips, suddenly full blown in 
a moment of high confusion within that casque. 

"Some of our men like the other Way better," 
the Captain continued. "Some of them are like a 
little fool I saw up between Chateau-Thierry and 
Fismes. He was just a kid, a few months from 
home. When I saw him first he was goin' like hell 
down through the open woods after a Boche. 

"'Shoot him!' I yelled. 'Shoot him!' 

" 'Shoot him, hell! I want to stick him!' That's 
what the kid said, and, believe me, he did it too." 

The auditors around the mess table smiled appre- 
ciatively. 

"I guess he remembered what they used to tell 
us in the cantonments;" here the Captain raised his 
voice to the drillmaster's tone of command. " 'Put 
some pep Into it! What you want is guts on both 
ends of the bayonet!' ' 

The slang is American. So is the story, sub- 
mitted here in proof of the fact that even in Ameri- 
can sectors the wheels of Juggernaut's car some- 
times cut through the crust into "a marsh of blood 
and bones." 

But even though America has had some share in 
the experience of war, she has contributed prac- 
tically nothing to the interpretation of this experi- 
ence. She sent eager, careless Youth to battle; it 
is reticent, triumphant Youth that she has received 
back again. And as yet there has not been so much 
as an honest attempt to gather together the raw 
material for an American war literature; least of 
all has there been any interpretative work worthy 
of notice. 

This national dumbness itself a condition which 
demands, perhaps defies, interpretation is shared 
in some measure by England and by Germany, but 
not by Austria, and certainly not by France. In 
Latzko's Men in War, in Barbusse's Under Fire, and 
now in Kreutz's Captain Zillner (Doran), the filth 
and wreckage of the battlefield are hooked up for 
examination hastily, before mold and maggots 
make the task impossible. And in Barbusse's Light 
(Button), an attempt is made to illuminate, not 
alone the ruinous present, but the future that must 
be built upon this putrid mass. 

War, these artists agree, is most notable for its 
horror and its filth. Cafes booming with national 
anthems ; barracks that sweat and roar in the travail 
of armies; rushing trains that click out "good-bye 



to all to all to all"; marches by day and by 
night, faster and faster toward the horizon where 
the guns growl incessantly; the final halt; the first 
shell; the charge victory or death! . . . 
Slowly and inevitably, as a dumb animal sinks into 
quicksand, Captain Zillner and his company of 
little souls sink down into the morass of battle 
down to where "a line of men lay in position at the 
edge of the wood, . . . as if waiting the word 
to fire, with their cheeks pressed against the butts 
of their rifles or with faces hidden in the grass 
they were dead men." 

But Kreutz's armies never descend to the seventh 
hell of horror from which Latzko's Men in War 
have no escape. "Does not each tick of the second 
hand mark the death rattle of thousands of men?" 
asks the maniac whose body has been snatched up 
from the depths. 

In order to hear the hell raging yonder on the other side of 
the thick wall of air, is it not enough to know of chins 
blown off, throats cut open and corpses locked in a death 
embrace? If a man were lying comfortably in bed and 
found out for certain that some one next door were being 
murdered, would you say he was sick if he jumped up out 
of bed with his heart pounding? And are we anything but 
next door to places where thousands duck down in frantic 
terror, where the earth spits mangled fragments of bodies 
up into the sky and the sky hammers down on the earth 
with fists of iron? 

Hammers down on the earth hammers into the 
earth such figures as these, revealed to Barbusse 
(Under Fire) when "the wind licks up the sugared 
snow" from the gray plain: 

these three putrified corpses on top of each other, in each 
other, with their round gray caps whose red edge is hidden 
with a gray band, their yellow-gray jackets, and their green 
faces. I look for the features of one of them. From the 
depths of his neck up to the tufts of hair that stick to 
the brim of his cap is just an earthy mass, the face be- 
come an anthill, and two rotten berries in place of the 
eyes. Another is a dried emptiness flat on its belly, the 
back in tatters that almost flutter, the hands, feet, and face 
enrooted in the soil. 

For art's sake, Baudelaire, Maupassant, and per- 
haps a few others have spoken thus of the maggoty 
horrors of death. But we are persuaded that the 
writers of these chronicles of war have no concern 
with abstract art or disembodied truth. They are 
wholly preoccupied with the effect of the actuality 
of war upon the soldier, and most of all with the 
effect of the truth about war on society. Their 
works are to be judged, then, not as stories or 
novels, but as gospels. 

In Men in War, in Captain Zillner, and in Bar- 
busse's earlier volume a certain large Lkeness is 
discoverable; the three depend for their results up-

on an intense emotional reaction. For Latzko, the 
experience of war lies "entirely without the pale of 
human sanity"; his characters go mad, or topple 
headlong into oblivion; his hope, if he has a hope, 
is that men will turn with maniacal fury upon their 
masters that out of horror re-directed there will 
come an end of horror. At best it is a fight with 
"the damned thing" in the dark. 

What Kreutz expects of the future it is difficult 
to determine. His unpracticed hand fumbles with 
superfluous and unreal characters caught in a mesh 
of coincidence. Even in the individual study that 
forms the substance of the book- the story of the 
gradual extinction of Zillner's faith there are ele- 
ments of uncertainty. It is the futility of death and 
destruction that breaks this spirit; but without the 
weight of official bungling, of national defeat, of 
personal disappointment, would the collapse have 
been as complete? Is Captain Zillner the victim 
of War, or of his part in this war? The question 
goes unanswered. And it is no full vision of a new 
world, but the voice of a lost child, that finally 
draws the Captain back from the brink of suicide 
and sends him hobbling off down the road "in 
search of the children, the little saviors of the 
world." . . . Yes! Soldiers, or the mothers 
of soldiers! 

Under Fire exhibits no such confusion of individ- 
ual and general motives, no faltering of faith in the 
future. The creatures that make up Barbusse's 
armies lose in their common suffering and their 
common ecstasy the marks "that make them soldiers: 

We cannot decide the identity of these beings, either by 
their clothes, thickly covered with filth, or by their head 
dress, for they are bareheaded or swathed in woolens under 
their liquid and offensive cowls; . . . All these men 
of corpse-like faces who are before us and behind us, 
. . . all these earth-charged men who, you would say, 
were carrying their own winding-sheets, are as much alike 
as if they were naked . . . It is the end of all. For 
the moment it is the prodigious finish, the epic cessation 
of the war . . . But suddenly one of the prone survivors 
rose to his knees, dark as a great bat ensnared, and as the 
mud dripped from his waving arms he cried in a hollow 
voice, 'There must be no more war after this!' . . . 
The sullen or furious exclamations of these men fettered 
to the earth, ip.carnate of earth, arose and slid away on the 
wind with beating wings 'No more war! No more war!' 

Here it is then, the martyr's faith in Heaven. 
Surely the earth's agony has not been for nothing! 
Somehow all that the present has lost must have a 
balance in what the future is to gain! Somehow 
that is if one shares a religious faith so illogical 
that it does not see the need of a god to perform 
the miracles it expects. 

Is this, then, the only refuge of the human 
spirit from the horrors of war Latzko's madness, 
or the millenial faith of Kreutz, and of Barbusse in 



his earlier period? Experience testifies that the 
ways of escape are far more numerous. 

It is not the general and the usual but the particu- 
lar and the exceptional forms of death and destruc- 
tion that arouse the feelings of horror. The soldier 
in the presence of the actuality of war, or the civil- 
ian assailed by ghoulish descriptions of its terrors, 
will not ordinarily go mad. He may rather be ex- 
pected to become immune to horror, by habituation, 
or by the rationalization of his experience. 

Unquestionably the refuge of habitual 'on is the 
safest and most popular retreat of harassed hu- 
manity. In the presence of an ordinary dinner, a 
truly logical Baudelerian mind would endure the 
tortures of the damned; what can a living body have 
to do with this material, dead and already partly 
decomposed? Reason in a meat-shop might ask 
such a question, did not habit keep ideas of this 
sort out of consciousness. And it is no use deny- 
ing that man is capable of becoming completely 
hardened to the suffering and death of his fellow 
men, just as to that of the lower animals; certainly 
the records show no great frequency of madness 
among hospital men and undertakers! 

Rationalization is a process more difficult of ex- 
planation. The term rationalization is used here 
in the loosest possible sense to cover all the cases 
where there exists a conviction or belief that the 
loss incurred will be balanced by a proportional 
gain. Between the heartlessness of the surgeon en- 
gaged upoM his first major operation, and the rapt 
adoration of a Christian martyr, there is room for 
a thousand varieties of self-assurance that somehow 
good will come out of evil. 

With the neatly materialistic logic of the surgeon 
we have no concern. But when discussion deals 
with war, the martyr spirit cannot have too much 
consideration. Christianity, and a dozen other sys- 
tems that have preceded and paralleled it, have 
been busy for thousands of years teaching the ser- 
viceability of suffering, the value of self-sacrifice, 
for the ennoblement of character and the salvation 
of the soul. It is no part of our task to determine 
whether it was by design or by chance that a human 
trait most serviceable to those who impose suffer- 
ing and demand self-sacrifice has been so assidu- 
ously cultivated. Certain it is that this trait of char- 
acter had attained a degree of strength wholly un- 
suspected until the world martyrdom of the last 
five years gave an opportunity for its display. And 
now, when the near universality of the martyr 
spirit, the astonishing "goodness" of the human 
character, has just been proved on a thousand battle- 
fields, there are still men who would frighten the 
world away from war with tales of the horrers of

war. To Latzko the best answer is Barbusse Bar- 
busse, who sees the writings of the armies as clearly 
as the other who sees his own army crucified for 
the future of the race. 

Now, as long as the people believe in the refine- 
ment of the spirit by martyrdom or are content 
with still more nebulous rewards in Heaven, faith 
in the celestial balance of good and evil will cover 
a multitude of sufferings. But it is generally held 
that in this modern time men tend increasingly to 
look for tangible" rewards here on earth. Pro-war 
literature takes cognizance of this fact; men are 
urged to sacrifice themselves, not now for the pres- 
ervation of the true faith, but in order that some 
projected ideal may take the shape of reality in the 
world. It no longer suffices to preach the crusade in 
the abstract. A nation at war must acknowledge 
terrestrial war aims. And as the sacrifice demanded 
becomes increasingly huge, these aims must take on 
a proportional grandeur, until the climax conies 
and the World War becomes a war for world de- 
mocracy. 

It would naturally be supposed that when the 
reward is thus brought within the terrestrial realm 
of reason, the people who are called upon to make 
the necessary sacrifice would seek most earnestly 
for its requitement. But an empirical test of this 
theory brings the mind flat against a monstrous para- 
dox: that men are more willing to give their bodies 
to be burned than to give a modicum of time and 
attention to the achievement of the results bought 
at the price of their own suffering. It is this suc- 
cession of ecstasy and indifference that enables the 
diplomats to sacrifice aims that would justify any 
war in a treaty that would disgrace any peace. No 
one doubts but that half a dozen resolute men in 
high places could today throw America into a war 
for Shantung; and yet our national executive could 
change his mind at the peace table and give away 
Shantung, and the Fourteen Points to toot, with- 
out arousing anything more than a grunt of pro- 
test. Animal inheritence and centuries of training 
in self-sacrifice have their result: "character" over- 
tops intelligence, and humanity is fitter for Heaven 
than for the earth. From indifference and ignor- 
ance from "the abyss of the people" no amount 
of "goodness" and high hope can resurrect the race. 
The war has proved this to the satisfaction of Bar- 
busse; the universal martyrdom of Under Fire 
conies to nothing without the universal intelligence 
of Light. 

Through the first thirteen chapters of this novel 
a narrative in the first person, like Under Fire 
the action passes under the steady illumination of 
"single-light" realism. Then Simon Paulin, like 



Saul of Tarsus, has his vision; he is struck down in 
battle, and when he emerges at last from torment 
it is not Paulin that speaks, but Barbusse. Enough 
has already been said to prove that this intellectual 
awakening which perhaps did not come to Bar- 
busse himself until the end of the conflict is not 
the normal reaction of men in war. And yet the 
salvation of the world is here made to depend upon 
such an awakening, complete and universal in its 
character : 

I used to think that resignation was a virtue [writes Bar- 
busse]. I see now that it is a vice. . . . the only 
memory it is important to preserve of the years we have 
endured is that of their loathsome horror and lunacy. . . . 

Ah, there are cloudy moments when one asks himself if 
men do not deserve all the disasters into which they rush! 
No I recover myself they do not deserve them. But we, 
instead of saying "I wish," must say "I will." And what 
we will, we must will to build it, with order, with method, 
beginning at the beginning, when once we have been as 
far as that beginning. We must not only open our eyes, 
but our arms, our wings. . . . 

r . . the poor, the exploited, are fifteen hundred mil- 
lions here on earth. They are the Law because they are 
the Number. . . . People of the world, establish equal- 
ity up to the limits of your great life. . . . 

Mutual solidarity is of the intellect common-sense, logic, 
methodical precision, order without faltering, the ruthless 
inevitable perfection of light! 

In my fervor, in my hunger, and from the depths of my 
abyss, I uttered these words aloud amid the silence. 

And as the mockery of a diplomatic peace has 
answered the martyr's cry "No more war ! No more 
war!" so this appeal to universal intelligence re- 
futes itself in the words of Barbusse's drunken anar- 
chist, "Folks aren't wicked, but they're stupid, stu- 
pid, stupid." 

The emotions of humanity come readily to the 
service of any cause. With intelligence the case 
is different. The problem is not how to arouse it, 
but how to create it. 

The war system of today rests upon the uncon- 
trovertible truth that humanity has always more 
willingly fought in war than it has thought in peace. 
Get a war declared and you can get it fought. Pro- 
claim peace, and the people sleep again. 

This truth is easier found than the explanation 
of it and the remedy that will make it into error. 
Born into the world by no will of his own, man is 
the slave of a rapacious body that directs the first 
efforts of the mind to the satisfaction of physical 
appetites. Most of the men who fight the world's 
wars have no time to think of battle until the body 
is itself in contact with war's new and special 
forms of hunger, weariness and death until war 
becomes an "everyday problem" and then it is 
too late. 

When the means of unchaining war are so com- 
pletely developed and so simple, when the means 
of peace are not as yet the subject of so much as 



438

a theoretical agreement, certainly something like 
a generally developed intelligence is necessary for 
the maintenance of peace. The goal is distant and 
indistinct, but the line of approach is plain enough 
reorganize industry to give more play to individ- 
ual initiative and more time for its exercise; reor- 
ganize education to place more emphasis on reason, 
and less on blind altruism. Until some such 



slow and methodical reformation of the primary 
units and organizations of society begins to have 
its effect, appeals to suicidal emotions and em- 
bryonic intelligence are of no avail, war is as norm- 
al as peace, and visions of perpetual harmony are 
no more than a martyr's hope of Heaven. 

GEROID ROBINSON. 



The Remaking of a Mind 



J.HE GRATUITOUS OBFUSCATION imported into an 
already trying state of affairs by some of our most 
eminent Socialist pamphleteers has naturally 
roused an interest in the working of the Socialist 
mind. On the surface we have what looks like 
a monstrous paradox. Perhaps even a hoax. 
After years of patient and not too hopeful propa- 
ganda, these gentlemen see their theories magically 
investing themselves with life and movement over 
a great part of Europe and assuming that air of 
self-determination which is the mark of a matured 
responsibility. Are they therefore happy? Not 
visibly. Instead of the triumphant chorus with 
which we might reasonably have expected them 
to greet the transformation -say in Russia we 
have something like a wail of despair and a deafen- 
ing clamor of protest. The note is so shrill as to 
suggest panic. And it has in it something of the 
impotent dismay of the schoolmaster who sees his 
pupils getting out of hand. So violent is the re- 
vulsion, indeed, that our pamphleteers have no dif- 
ficulty in establishing an entente with the hitherto 
despised corrupters of the popular mind, and ap- 
pear monthly as the props of the status quo in 
the bourgeois magazines. Reality, apparently, is 
a disturbing business, more acutely and inherently 
unpleasant than the reformist mind is likely to 
assume. 

For the explanation of this acute distress it is 
necessary to "go back" to Marx or, at any rate, 
to the Marxians. Marx and Darwin may fairly be 
ranked together as the founders of the new order 
if there is a new order. Now the treatment they 
have received at the hands of their respective fol- 
lowers is at least suggestive. Both appealed to 
science, and thereby invited the full rigors of 
scientific criticism. In Darwin's case we may say 
that by and large the invitation has been accepted. 
There has been no personal cult, at least, and pious 
exegesis is not a recognized part of biology. In- 
creasingly the tendency has been to supplant opin- 
ion with knowledge, regardless of the consequences 



to Darwin's prestige. The field has remained open. 
The fate of Marx has been different. By reason 
of the passionate hopes to which he appealed and 
the Jong frustrations out of which he seemed to 
point the way, his creed has almost from the first 
invested itself with a religious sanctity. It has 
undergone at the hands of its devotees much the 
same treatment as other religious creeds. True 
the revisionists have not been idle, but their work 
has commonly taken the form of "interpretations" 
a sure sign that somewhere or other there is an 
uneasy concern with party morale, which is irrele- 
vant in science. In short, we have to do with piety 
and a careful calculation of the effect of renewals 
on the solid front. The result has been disastrous 
in two ways: it has encouraged among the rank 
and file a faith in the adequacy of formulae which 
has blinded them to inconvenient fact, and it has 
stimulated in the more alert minds a casuistical 
address in searching out "authoritative" sanctions 
for new attitudes. The net outcome of all this 
mental inertia on the one hand and emotional 
strain on the other has been dogma, r gid reaction 
patterns, and a grudging allowance of the world's 
right to move on. History seems to show that the 
most remorseless of all dogmatists are precisely the 
non-conformists. 

Henry de Man has given us with admirable can- 
dor in The Remaking of a Mind (Scribner) the 
confession of one Socialist's struggle with dogma. 
Before the war he was a leader of the Belgian 
Labor Party and an intimate friend of Karl Lieb- 
knecht, with whom he was associated in the forma- 
tion of the International Socialist Young People's 
Federation. When Belgium was unexpectedly in- 
vaded, he enlisted at once and fought throughout 
the war, interrupting his service only by official 
visits to Russia and America. The war put his 
theories on trial and led to an agonized reexam- 
ination of the whole basis of h's faith. For him 
the problem was less simple than it looked to 
national idealists (and Defense Leaguers) on the

one hand, or intransigent Socialists on the other. 
Was it actually a war for democracy? And if the 
facts were not really so simple, was there still noth- 
ing to choose between the capitalism of the Cen- 
tral Empires and that of the Western Allies? 
M. de Man thought there was in the long run. 
Enough to justify sacrifices. But there is no doubt 
that the accumulating evidence of Allied diplomacy 
added to his moments of torturing doubt, and if 
his confession proves anything, it proves up to 
the hilt that honest questionings and an anxious 
scrutiny of ends are not destructive of morale. 
From the position to which he finally won through 
he challenges the traditional Socialist attitude. His 
attack takes the form of an examination of the dis- 
astrous effects of dogma on thinking and a general 
review of the inadequate psychological basis on 
which Marxian Socialism rests. With the funda- 
mental Socialist analysis of the war the out- 
reaching for new markets and safe areas of in- 
vestment by a profit-taking society in the satura- 
tion stage of industrialism he is of course in sub- 
stantial agreement; but he insists that emphasis 
on the purely economic has blinded Socialists to 
the working of non-economic motives, simplified 
their analysis to the point of falsification, and 
blunted the full force of their appeal for popular 
support. That this has not been altogether un- 
fortunate however he freely admits, since it is 
now clear that the menace to freedom of the old 
uncritical bureaucratic Socialism was at least as 
great as that of capitalism itself. And the way 
out? Certainly It cannot be by the naive dream of 
a multiplied officialdom. M. de Man prefers now 
to call himself a radical and advocates an experi- 
mental advance towards industrial democracy, with 
a minimum of state interference. But he has no 
plan of his own. Indeed, he confesses that he has 
had enough of programs. What is needed is rather 
a method, together with a much subtler understand- 
ing of what is required to bring into being "the 
new state of mind that is needed to help humanity 
recover the control of its destinies." The New 
Socialism, he tells us, will be pragmatic and prac- 
tical, even as the pre-war Socialism was dogmatic 
and sectarian. 

What is original and arresting in the book is 
thus not M. de Man's formal thinking. What is 
interesting is the rare honesty with which, in tracing 
the workings of his own mind under stress, he 
uncovers the motives of a former leader of revolt, 
and gives us the reactions of an avowed interna- 
tionalist and foe of war to the ecstasies of blood 
lust. All that part of his book is amazingly and 



refreshingly free from cant and well worth attend- . 
ing to. Whether this is due in part to an insen- 
sitiveness to nuance doesn't matter; the effect is 
the same. In the first place M. de Man, as he 
never allows us to forget, had the inestimable 
advantage of descending into Socialism from above. 
His interest in the movement was inspired among 
other things by a "chivalrous disposition," which 
disposed him to feel for the under-dog and to wish 
to communicate to him "the knowledge which I 
owed to my education as a 'privileged born.' " For 
the rest, no small part of the motive complex ap- 
pears to have been made up of a "desire for au- 
thority, responsibility, and command." This is 
candid and illuminating. It suggests that by a 
little burrowing in the unfamiliar underworld of 
the mind, which their rationalistic preconceptions 
have too long allowed them to ignore, other So- 
cialist leaders might bring to light a similar will 
to power. However that may be, this same desire 
for authority, responsibility, and command stood 
M. de Man in excellent stead during the war, and 
we find him referring affectionately to "my men" 
and running on in quite an idyllic strain: 

I had been extremely lucky, for the some 200 boys of 
my battery were all thoroughly good and devoted fellows, 
without a single black sheep amongst them. I was, there- 
fore, able to maintain discipline and the high standard of 
fighting efficiency required for trench mortar work, without 
ever having to punish or even to give formal commands. 
We loved each other and knew it, although circumstances 
(no soft spots!) did not allow any demonstration of feel- 
ing. . . .1 know although they never said a word 
about it they were grateful for my efforts to create welfare 
institutions in the battery, such as a library, a canteen, a 
transportable bath, a whole equipment for games and sport- 
exercises, a band, courses for the illiterate, and many other 
things. I was amply rewarded for these efforts by the joy 
I felt in commanding men under such exceptionally satis- 
factory conditions, and finding that they responded to my 
will like the strings of a well-tuned musical instrument to 
the fingers of an artist. 

So! Surely this is all very familiar and suggests 
the dreams of an efficiency engineer married to a 
welfare worker. 

M. de Man offers himself to us as one cleansed 
of dogma. But is he really so fortunate? Let us 
see. Our own leaders have winced under the acid 
test of Russia. Is he similarly sensitive? Appar- 
ently. He is at least as harsh with the Bolsheviki 
as our own John Spargo, and altogether for doc- 
trinal reasons. That doesn't sound promising for 
the "new mind." An official visitor to Russia dur- 
ing the Kerensky regime, he was franked in offi- 
cial circles and is able to confirm in detail the im- 
becilities of Allied diplomacy, to which he ascribes

the fall of the government. But beyond that he 
doesn't convince us that he is a good observer. 
He is so concerned with theory that facts elude 
him or get hopelessly out of focus. And if we 
check his views on Russia with the unique picture 
he gives us of the United States a bizarre blend 
of the Declaration of Independence, the Goddess 
of Liberty, Huck Finn, and Walt Whitman we 
shall be ia no danger of overrating his acumen. 
Nevertheless he is a witness against the Soviet 
government, and, like most witnesses for or against, 
he leaves you wondering whether there is such a 
thing in the world as disinterested curiosity. You 
would suppose an experiment so momentous and 
conducted on so gigantic a scale would invite a 
little first-hand study, and that prophecies as to 
its success or failure (if they were risked at all) 
would be based on a serious marshaling of rele- 
vant fact. But relevant fact is precisely what we 
have never had and what there seems precious little 
chance of our ever having. M. de Man adds noth- 
ing to our store. Why trouble with facts when 
you can demolish error with a theory? Especially 
an impressive theory. For him the special and 
sufficient crime of the Bolsheviki is that they failed 
to respect the appointed historic order. Instead 
of going submissively through the regular stages 
of capitalism, respectable republican institutions, 
and so on, like their Western neighbors, they chose 
to indulge in futuristic experiments at the risk of 
wrecking Socialism. Underlying his argument 
throughout there appears to be an implicit accept- 
anca of the hoary unilinear theory, which has long 
since been carted off to the museum of antiquities 
by the anthropologists who formulated it. But 
contemplation of Bolshevist enormities seems to 
have filled him with a renewed tenderness for 
capitalism in general, and American capitalism in 
particular, which he denominates as "pure." An 
internationalist and therefore sensitive to the charge 
of tribalism, M. de Man visibly winces under the 
Bolshevik epithet "vulgar patriots." To whom was 
this epithet applicable? Why, to such wia-the-war 
Socialists as Kautsky in Germany, Hyndman in 
England, Jules Guesde in France, and many more 
whom he carefully lists. "It strikes me that none 
of the names I have just mentioned is Jewish, and 
that half of them denote an origin from among 
the so-called upper strata of European society. I 
point this out merely as a contribution to a psycho- 
logical explanation, and not by any means an at- 
tack on the Jewish race." The absence of tribal 
ardors implies, evidently, no compensating lack of 
tribal prejudice. And the psychological explana- 



tion? M. de Man suggests that it lies in the fact 
that his Socialists had "roots" in the country. If 
certain rude proletarians hazard another guess and 
are already hinting that for the word "roots" the 
word "stake" should be substituted, that only proves 
the author's thesis by showing how a fanatical em- 
phasis on doctrine to wit, the well-known eco- 
nomic interpretation leads infallibly to error. 

But these are peccadilloes. On the positive side 
M. de Man wins our gratitude by the candor with 
which he records the effects of fighting on himself 
and those about him. In spite or rather because 
of the calm, matter-of-fact tone the confession has 
a terrific impact. Its value lies in tke fine courage 
and indifference to conventional reserves that al- 
lowed him to write it. Thoroughly in earnest, he 
never spares himself. Nor does he leave any doubt 
that, whatever his original bias, he is a competent 
witness. For his instincts responded to the war 
with a savage intensity that inhibited any critical 
action of the mind. Under fire he became simply 
the killing animal, intoxicated with blood lust, blind 
to all the values of civilized living, for whom a 
"direct hit" with its ghastly accompaniment of 
flying human fragments and agonized shrieks in 
the enemy trenches was the vary ecstasy of joy, a 
delirium that left him white and shaken, filled with 
an inappeasable thirst for slaughter. "If I could 
only obey the will of my animal instincts, I would 
this very day start on a journey of ten thousand 
miles if by so doing I might enjoy something anal- 
ogous to a 'direct hit' and revive the rapture 
of those voluptuous seconds." Not till afterwards 
did remorse seize him, a burning shame which will 
be with him, he implies, as long as he lives. Con- 
cerned to give its coup de grace to th silly ro- 
mance which sees in every soldier a hero, he runs 
the whole gamut of war emotions and finds them 
all in the last analysis degrad'ng. In its reactions 
on individual initiative, on sex morally, an con- 
structive social impulses, the discipline of war is 
alike disastrous. That way lies rebarbarization. 
But it is on the fatal ease with which the killing 
animal emerges that he dwells. And if current 
events in Europe and America have any significance 
there is surely point in his final question. Can a 
society in which there is so much wrong and over 
which the directing classes already have so pre- 
carious a hold really afford to stimulate the fighting 
instinct on a gigantic scale? It is a question which 
our conscriptionists and champions of universal 
service would do well to ponder.

Freedom and the Grace of God 



A HE ULTIMATE DIFFERENCE between prose and 
poetry is becoming more difficult to define as the 
novelist encroaches on the precincts of the poet. 
The vers librist contends that the work of the one 
is distinguished from that of the other by the pres- 
ence or absence of the "return." But the novels 
which approach most nearly the method of the 
Imagists seem less to progress than to recur, with 
a fine firm emphasis, to the authors' emotional 
bias. 

Mary Olivier, by May Sinclair (Macmillan), 
though it compasses a life, has much the same 
character as the infinitely slow, infinitely careful 
Pilgrimage, of which the fourth (but not the final) 
volume has recently been published (The Tunnel, 
by Dorothy Richardson; Knopf). The authors of 
both betray this bias. For all their interesting 
difference, they use one method and achieve one 
end. 

Miss Sinclair has always shown herself a keen 
psychologist and a thorough craftsman. Miss Rich- 
ardson however preceded her in the development 
of the technique which renders these novels remark- 
able. The detail is reminiscent of the treatment 
of light introduced by the impressionists. Just 
as they covered a canvas with tiny points of color 
till it quivered with luminosity, so Miss Richard- 
son, and Miss Sinclair after her, crowd their pages 
with close colored moments. There are long dark 
stretches in both books. But the effect of this 
method is always vivid and intense. Every part 
of their canrases throbs with immediacy. In each 
case the author is dealing not with the bony struc- 
ture of a novel so much as with the intricate play 
of responsive nerves. Like life, these histories lack 
a plot; they are held together simply by that per- 
sonality which is the river-bed of a streaming 
consciousness. 

It follows that such biography has somewhat 
the quality of autobiography. In the case of Miss 
Sinclair there is some internal evidence that might 
suggest this. Mary Olivier seems to gather up 
and concentrate so much of what showed itself in 
Miss Sinclair's earlier work. Apart from the in- 
forming idealism, there is the emphasis on what 
Veblen calls "the dead hand of the parent," which 
was felt more heavily by the generation preceding 
our own. There is Mary's life in Garth, the Garth 
of The Three Sisters, with its windy moors and 
circumscribed lives. There is Mary's omnivorous 
persistent intellectual curiosity, stronger than 
everything except her mother's peculiar jealous 



power. There is finally, if foremost, Mary's unique 
apprehension of experience. How old these pre- 
occupations are, how bound up with the author's 
previous accomplishment, her personal and intel- 
lectual history, is more or less apparent. In this 
connection I may be permitted to quote what I 
said about May Sinclair in Reedy's Mirror a year 
ago: 

The final thing [in "The Tree of Heaven"] is not the 
triumph of the spirit half so clearly as it is the thwarting 
of the flesh. And for such an idealist as May Sinclair 
the two are wonderfully one. 

That would seem to be her conclusive message. In 
all her novels she draws men and women torn and baf- 
fled by sex, by genius, by the ineluctable demand for 
life. She shows them yielding to this demand, some flinch- 
ing more terribly than others, but all at the mercy of a 
will stronger than themselves. She shows them in re- 
bellion against that will, and in their transcendent mo- 
ments reconciling their own impulses to the larger power. 
She does not deny the flesh. Rather through it she 
reaffirms the. spirit. And yet in all her work is visible 
a puritanic strain, a vision of the unearthly immortal pas- 
sion that surmounts the cravings for finite satisfaction, 
and finds its peace in the embrace of an impalpable reality. 

So in Mary Olivier we find the middle-aged 
woman, utterly alone, utterly at one with that dis- 
covered reality! In clipped characteristic style we 
have her eventual persuasion: 

The grace of God was a real thing. It was that miracle 
of perfect happiness, with all its queerness, its divine 
certainty and uncertainty. The Christians knew at least 
one thing about it; they could see that it had nothing 
to do with deserving. But it had nothing to do with be- 
lieving, either, or with being god and getting into 
heaven. It was heaven. It had to do with beauty, abso- 
lutely un-moral beauty, more than anything else. 

She couldn't see the way of it beyond that. It had eome 
to her when she was a child in brilliant, clear flashes; 
it had come again and again in her adolescence, with more 
brilliant and clearer flashes; then, after leaving her for 
twenty-three years, it had eome like this streaming in 
and out of her till its ebb and flow were the rhythm of her 
life. 

Herein the author and the subject seem inex- 
tricably confused. Miss Sinclair writing about 
Mary's infant susceptibilities, about Mary's avid 
philosophizing, about Mary amid the provincial 
society and the lonely beauty of Garth, gives us a 
distinct person. Miss Sinclair writing about Mary's 
brothers and certain of her friends hedges and 
blurs her canvas. Something gets in her way, 
not Mary's way but the author's way, so that their 
charm becomes factitious and their dreadfulness 
strangely vague. She deals with Mary Olivier's 
consciousness from infancy through middle age. 
She uses not quite 400 pages in which to deal with 
it. Miss Richardson deals with M riam Hender- 
son's consciousness, beginning with her seventeenth

year, and in this fourth volume showing her young 
woman at twenty-one. Obviously Miss Richard- 
son's pilgrimage is a more le'surely one. Perhaps 
on this account she conveys more vividly than Miss 
Sinclair the thing both are trying for. But the 
search for reality, reality which, like happiness, is 
not won but experienced which happens to one, 
like love, 1 ke any accident, is Dorothy Richardson's 
reality too. 

In every volume of Pilgrimage, Miss Richard- 
son gives us Miriam's experience solely, and almost 
completely. The gaps are the gaps in Miriam's 
consciousness, not those of the writer's prejudices. 
The things that are important are those that strike 
Miriam with the right arresting force. Miriam's 
life, it is true, is much freer than Mary's. Never 
enslaved by a maternal jealousy that existed as 
actually for her as it did for M'ss Sinclair's pro- 
tagonist, Miriam was released early to go her own 
way. In The Tunnel she is more definitely going 
it than in any of the earlier books. Even though 
she doesn't know where she is coming out. 

But here she is in London, a "dental secretary," 
with a room and a life of her own. London is 
not as vivid as the Germany of Pointed Roofs. 
Perhaps because the continuity is broken by its 
varied appeals: the daily labor in the office, the 
contacts there with the three dentists, each so 
definitely engraved upon her mind; the lectures 
in Albemarle Street; the week ends with Harriet 
and Gerald, or at Alma's clever gatherings; the rich 
evenings, draped in a bath-towel, smoking ciga- 
rettes, and talking with glorious content, free and 
aware and interested, with the girls in Blooms- 
bury. But for all the variety of her London life, 
in contrast with the limited contacts of the Ger- 
man or English school-rooms, the Miriam of The 
Tunnel differs from the Miriam of the earlier vol- 
umes only in her more instructed grasp of experi- 
ence. A serene liberty radiates out of even the 
bleaker hours. 



Reasoning, much more than invention, is the 
child of necessity. Miriam at twenty-one has more 
imp'.nging people and events to reason about than 
she ever had before. Possibly because her diffi- 
culties at worst are less than those of Mary Olivier, 
Miriam's philosophy seems not so much a strain- 
ing after compensatory perfection as a reasoning 
acceptance of it. Compare the passage quoted 
above with the following from The Tunnel: 

. . . Perhaps there is happiness only in the things one 
does deliberately without a visible reason; drifting off -to 
Germany, because it called ; coming here today . . . 
in freedom. If you are free, you are alive . . . noth- 
ing that happens in the part of your life that is not free, 
the part you do and are paid for, is alive. Today, because 
I am free I am the same person as I was when I was 
there, but much stronger and happier because I know 
it. As long as I can sometimes feel like this, nothing has 
mattered. Life is a chain of happy moments that cannot 
die. 

The conclusion is the same for the middle-aged 
woman whom Miss Sinclair drags through so much 
dreary sacrifice as it is for the girl whom Miss 
Richardson shows moving through life so deliber- 
ately without a visible reason. It is a conclusion 
that is shared by adolescents and middle-aged 
people. It is not improbably related to sexual sat- 
isfaction, which Mary's liaison, tardy and brief, 
and Miriam's curiously happy loneliness do not 
achieve. Granted its subjectivity, it has all the 
"sting" of personal experience, all the imperative- 
ness of passionate belief. Mary Olivier reads like 
a fictional transcription of Miss Sinclair's Defense 
of Idealism. To a degree The Tunnel reads the 
same way. The Tunnel has passages that ring with 
the final authenticity of the dictaphone. Certainly 
Mary Olivier has them too. In both cases there 
is that element of "return" to a transcendent reality 
which is reminiscent of poetry, that sensitive apper- 
ception which makes for living prose.

A FORTNIGHTLY 



J_ HE ELEVENTH NOVEMBER is A DAY DEDICATE TO 
the white boutonniere of peace. But the particular 
Peace to which this day is specially dedicate is 
the twilight peace of the Armistice, which is of a 
peculiar and distinctive character. It is peace, 
but it is not marked by any degree of tranquility 
or good will, nor has it displaced martial law. It 
is in good part made up of alarms and recrimina- 
tion, of intrigue and hostilities, and it is hedged 
about w,ith fire, famine, and pestilence. It is a 
peace of a very special character, peculiar and dis- 
tinctive. The twelve months which have elapsed 
since the Armistice will show a larger expenditure 
for military operations and a larger total of war- 
like atrocities than any recorded twelve months of 
war, prior to the Great War of which this Peace is 
the aftermath. It was a peculiar peace in its in- 
ception, in that it was concluded in order to engage 
in a fight; and it has been a peculiar peace in its 
further course, in that it shows a steadily rising 
tide of quarrels, armaments, hostilities, expendi- 
tures, bankruptcies, and violations of international 
law, throughout these twelve months of its prose- 
cution hitherto. 

In view of this comfortless state of things it may 
be worth while to stop and take stock of the cir- 
cumstances which precipitated this peace of in-' 
trigue and atrocities upon the civilized nations; 
what was bargained for and what has been got. 
The elder statesmen who negotiated the peace have 
faithfully observed the punctilios of secret diplom- 
acy, and have given no sign as to what the bargain- 
ing was all about; but the past twelve months have 
brought much circumstantial evidence to the sur- 
face. So it is fairly plain now that it was a nego- 
tiated peace, in the nature of a compromise with the 
Central Powers, negotiated hastily to avert a col- 
lapse of the German military organization; such 
as would unavoidably have followed on a further 
three-months prosecution of the campaign on the 
western front. This hasty, and, in a sense, prema- 
ture, conclusion of hostilities could scarcely have 
been other than designed by the high political com- 
mand which had the bargaining to do. It left the 
German military establishment standing in a pass- 
ably serviceable state, and it left also the German 
Imperial organization virtually intact under a per- 
functory mask of democratic forms. Among the 
Guardians of the established order there appears 
plainly to have been a growing realization first 
voiced by the Lansdowne letters that the vested 
interests of property and class rule in the countries 



of the Entente must for their own benefit make 
common cause with the like interests in the coun- 
tries of the Central Powers if they were successfully 
to make head against their common enemy the 
increasingly uneasy underlying population on both 
sides. A prostrate and completely discredited Ger- 
man military establishment, such as another three 
months would have left, and a broken and emptied 
imperial organization, such as the same three 
months would have left with such an outcome of 
the war the German states would have gone Red 
and would have been fit to make trouble for none 
but themselves. Germany in that case would have 
been of no use for stabilizing things on the basis 
of the status quo ante, and the status quo ante has 
always been the object of the elder statesmen's af- 
fections and solicituds. Guardians of the Vested 
Interests, the elder statesmen sorely needed the bul- 
wark of a practicable German Empire to serve as 
a bar agairist the spread of Bolshevism out of Soviet 
Russia, and they likewise needed the active use of 
a practicable German military establishment to de- 
feat Bolshevism by fire, sword, and famine, in and 
out of Soviet Russia. Therefore it would not be 
expedient to break the Central Powers utterly, by 
another three months advance on the western front. 
The policy with regard to Soviet Russia became the 
acid test of Entente politics, in war and peace. The 
line of incentives which under this acid test brought 
the war to its premature termination, and which 
has continued to drive the policies of the Allied 
Powers and direct their maneuvers during the past 
twelve months, appears to be almost wholly com- 
prised in the proposition that Bolshevism is a men- 
ace to absentee ownership. It is another, and 
hitherto an open question, how near the elder 
statesmen are likely to realize their sanguine hope 
of subduing Soviet Russia by use of a subservient 
German military establishment. 



AMERICA'S MOST ARDENT INTERVENTIONIST CAN 
accuse the Mexican Government of nothing worse 
than inability and unwillingness to protect the 
rights of person and property from bandit depreda- 
tions, and the dstermination on its own part to con- 
fiscate private property in the form of oil rights. 
If Carranza lacks strength, we might conceivably 
allow him to purchase and ship to Mexico the muni- 
tions he is so much in need of. If there is a dis- 
position on the part of Mexicans, in and out of the 
Government, to regard Americans as enemies of

THE DIAL 



November 15 



Mexico, we might prove that we are not enemies 
by acting the part of friends; perhaps by putting 
a stop to gun-running, and to the subsidizing of 
bandit operations by the oil interests. It is barely 
possible that the oil interventionists will not be 
able to obscure the reasonableness of these proposi- 
tions. The second criticism of the Mexican Gov- 
ernment is entirely of another order; it belongs 
rather to the polity of the industrial future than to 
that of the political past. The Mexican Govern- 
ment, they say, is revolutionary, in that it threatens 
to confiscate private property. Exactly what Car- 
ranza does meditate doing in this matter it is im- 
possible to say; authorities disagree in their inter- 
pretations of the Mexican oil legislation, and in 
their predictions as to the turn enforcement will 
take. But in order that the essential proposition 
may stand alone, unburdened of all disputations as 
to matters of fact, let us suppose that the Mexican 
Government is about to confiscate all the privately 
owned oil wells in Mexico, without respect to the 
nationality of the owners, and that no provision has 
been made or will be made for the indemnification 
of these owners. We come then flat against this 
question: for the future, is any economic readjust- 
ment which involves the confiscation of foreign- 
owned property to be considered a casus belli by 
the government to which the dispossessed owners 
belong? If the answer is Yes, then we are already 
1'dble to Great Britain for the full amount of the 
British investments in the liquor business in this 
country. And if our railroads are nationalized 
under any arrangement that approaches confisca- 
tion, we shall have to float another Liberty Loan 
for the benefit of British investors, or else run the 
risk of most distressing diplomatic complications 
with His Majesty's Government. In a word, the 
principle of pro-property intervention is as broad, 
as reactionary, ^nd withal as dangerous as Metter- 
nich's doctrine of legitimacy. If such a principle 
is accepted, then the world, ripe now for every sort 
of economic experimentation, is condemned already 
to a series of propertarian crusades more destructive 
than the royalist wars of the Holy Alliance. 



J.HE PATRIOTIC OFFICERS OF THE UNITED MlJVE 

Workers we are sure would not call the determina- 
tion of the coal operators' to precipitate a strike 
and the move ol 'he Federal authorities to break 
the strike after it was called, collusion. They 
might admit, with prayers of forgiveness on their 
lips for any suggestion of heresy, that it was a 
case of like mindedness. Just as the President's 
telegram of congratulations to Governor Coolidge 
was prompted by an overflow of emotional sym- 
pathy, so were the Attorney General's peremptory 
orders to the union a response in sympathy with 
the operators. As a matter of fact a recognition of 
1-ikemindedness has more important bearings on 
the case than , a charge of collusion. A condition 



of likemindedness indeed between government ad- 
ministrators and coal operators is a matter which 
the public and the mine workers cannot afford to 
pass over even if the officials of the Miners' Union 
are blinded in their subserviency. While the coun- 
try does not expect the owners of the coal mines to 
operate the mines on any other principle than that 
of "business as usual," it supports a republican 
form of government on the theory that exploitation 
of natural resources has its limits, limits that, if 
publicly known, will not long be publicly endured. 
The point at issue now is that the limits have been 
passed, that is, the extent of the exploitation is 
known. The mismanagment of the coal resources 
is a public scandal and the mine officials in obeying 
the order ef the government are suppor-ting the 
government in its spiritual collusion with the opera- 
tors in their gross abuse of the nation's fuel re- 
sources. No one knows better than the miners that 
the coal mines must be guarded for the public good 
against piracy. But the officers of the union have 
failed to face the issue and have even pleaded with 
citizens to make no mention of a transfer from priv- 
ate to public control. Their failure to meet their 
trust as the Railroad Brotherhood met theirs in re- 
lation to the mismanagement of transportation is 
commensurate with their failure to maintain the 
position of defense which the trade union move- 
ment represents in its long fight for the right to 
strike. They failed the membership of their union 
and the whole organized labor movement when 
they complied with the order of an attorney gen- 
eral who amplified the significance of his order 
in the following statement : 

While the right to strike in all ordinary industries, under 
normal circumstances, cannot be denied, there are some 
callings which are so closely related to the life, liberty, and 
security of the people that the right to strike in those cases 
must be subordinated to the superior right of the public to 
enjoy uninterrupted service. Where the right of collective 
bargaining has been recognized and the peaceful processes 
of settlement of disputes has been offered and rejected, no 
Government worthy of the name can permit the strike 
weapon to be used to enforce the demands of a single class 
of workers at the expense of all the people. 

This statement gave them the opportunity if they 
had been men enough to use it to reply that callings 
"too closely related to the life, liberty and the 
security of the people" to permit the workers' use 
of the strike are likewise too close to permit their 
manipulation for private profit. The miners' offi- 
cials are taking chances with their membership, 
for their representatives ordered them to call a 
strike and at the same convention endorsed the 
Plumb Plan. The movement to overthrow union 
officials incapable of adjusting policy to the 
new industrial spirit which is struggling against 
odds to be born is illustrated in a number of or- 
ganizations at the present time where the double 
fight is being carried on against officers and em- 
ployers who the men charge are in collusion under 
the guise of patriotism for motives of profit.

Casual Comment 



I HE FALL BOOK GOSSIP HAS HAD MUCH TO SAY 

about the invasion of the best-seller list by such 
names as Conrad, Bojer, and Ibanez. The Cham- 
bers-Wright-Rinehart school still holds its place, 
but its monopoly is no more; the best, and those 
later comers who aspire to the best as Walpole, 
Maugham, and May Sinclair are increasingly in 
evidence; and the list, hitherto saccharine to nausea, 
begins to afford the tonic bitter-sweet of reality. 
But the innumerable explanations of this phenom- 
enon, pertinent or impertinent, have pretty much 
overlooked one salient factor in the change the 
intellectual independence and business courage of 
certain of the newer publishing houses, as notably 
Knopf, Huebsch, and Boni & Liveright. Such con- 
cerns have from time to time rasped the taste of 
a public too long accustomed to the conservative 
camms of the established publishers (themselves 
innovators in their day), but that is as nothing 
beside their services toward our growing cosmopoli- 
tanism and on behalf of our own younger writers: 
if sometimes they have outraged our taste, they have 
steadily operated to expand, liberalize, and raise 
it. So booklovers cannot but welcome this year's 
additions to the ranks of serious general publishers. 
Comes the firm of Harcourt, Brace & Howe, whose 
first two members have served a long apprentice- 
ship in Henry Holt & Co., with a catholic fall list 
that must delight all liberal readers. Comes also 
Scott & Seltzer, whose members have also had prac- 
tical publishing experience, . introducing here the 
work of Douglas Goldring, providing the first 
authoritative biography of Lenin, and opening the 
American book market to Gregory Zilboorg. And 
if the issuing of Corinne Lowe's novel Saul may 
be accepted as an indication of policy from the 
James A. McCann Co., here is a third comer whose 
lists the discriminating reader must shortly reckon 
with. 



JVlEANWHILE THERE ARE OTHER DEVELOPMENTS TO 

encourage the devotee of letters. That literature 
has long sold as widely in Europe as book mer- 
chandise sells here and we have lately had aston- 
ishing statistics from Scandinavia to prove it was 
considered indicative of nothing but American pro- 
vincialism until the success of the Everyman and 
Modern Library series demonstrated how very many 
Americans would buy literature if only it were 
made accessible at prices approaching those set by, 
for example, the famous Tauchnitz series. This 
field the Four Seas Co., of Boston, now enters with 
its International Pocket Library of good books at 
twenty-five cents each. The idea begins to command 
the attention it deserves: witness the fact that the 
prize in the New York Sun's recent contest for the 
best letters on the book trade went to a lengthy dis- 



cussion, by Mr. Simonson of the Wall Street Jour- 
nal, of the possibilities of binding American books 
in paper. There is moreover a growing specializa- 
tion in subject matter. One begins to look to 
Houghton Mifflin for the best in biography, to Mac- 
millan for the most considered sociology, to Scrib- 
ner for the most attractive travel books, to Lippin- 
cott for the latest works in certain branches of 
science, and so on. This year the A. W. Shaw Co., 
of Chicago, is making a holiday drive on the general 
retail market with its various series of business 
books gift books destined to longer and more 
useful lives than the best-sellers they will in many 
cases replace. That book shops devoted primarily 
to poetry are succeeding in many cities suggests 
that a similar specialization of subject matter may 
eventually make the retail book service more intelli- 
gent and efficient than it has been since advertising 
and modern merchandising drove the old-fashioned 
well-read bookseller from his corner stall. Re- 
ligion, at least, is to have this service in New York, 
where the various publishers of religious books last 
month cooperated to open the Religious Book Shop. 
All these items are no more than vanes in the 
weather they may indicate a prevailing wind ; they 
do not prove a gale. Yet it may not be many sea- 
sons before rising costs and the increasing complex- 
ity of publishing will themselves have forced an or- 
ganization of the book trade for literature no less 
than for best-sellers, so that our last state may 
after all be better than our first. 



JLHERE HAS EXISTED FOR SOME YEARS A LEGEND 

concerning the appearance on these shores of that 
rare bird, The Great American Novel. It is a 
beautiful legend. And many people, even some 
who laugh at it in public, give it privately the bene- 
fit of a doubt. So carefully has the lonely critical 
sense been instructed in this legend that every now 
and then the critic, eager to be the first on the scent, 
goes belling down the wind of journalism a grand 
discovery. 

Such tidings of great joy echo in certain phrases 
recently applied to the first novel of Henry K. 
Marks, a man who is, by his own admission at least, 
no novelist (Peter Middleton; Badger, Boston). It 
is said that his book is "a remarkable piece of writ- 
ing," "a tragedy of the most terrible sort," and that 
it "should be the first novel of any writer is fairly 
incredible." It is compared, most favorably, with 
Jennie Gerhardt and Ethan Frome. One enthusiast 
declares that Dreiser would wish he had written it, 
and Chambers would sit up all night to finish it. 
Or perhaps the other way around. 

The subject is indubitably interesting. The book 
concerns a man whose soul is sexless. The study 
of this abnormal type is rich in fascination for the 
psychologist. The author of the book happens to 
be a physician. The emphasis, then, is rather upon 
Peter's victimization by a syphilitic prostitute and

a fashionable doctor than upon his sexual and artis- 
tic impotence. Peter contracts the disease, more- 
over, in a quixotic, an utterly naive and utterly 
absurd performance which enables his wife to get 
the d.vorce she craves. The physician's bias is as 
clear in the Dickensian description of the fashion- 
able Dr. Bottomley as in the nurse's chart describ- 
ing Peter's illness, neither of which stir any emo- 
tion save ennui. The psychologist is s'mply not 
there. Every character except Peter is typical, from 
his charming extravagant first wife to his maternal 
friend, Elizabeth Lissinger, anoT his bourgeois 
mother-in-law. And Peter, the really interesting, 
perfectly credible exception, the center of the story, 
is so unreal as to be totally unsympathetic. As for 
the remarkable writing, there is any amount of it, 
largely of this order: 

Four days out nine, ten, eleven days more, what cared 
the philosophic old boat provided it got there? Second 
class indeed! Ah, but that was youth's way with age, man's 
ways with time-tried service. So it must have talked as it 
creaked along in the vast space of the night, meeting its 
old friends, the stars and the moon and perhaps the self- 
same spray that had danced and leapt against it years 
before. 

Of course this may be the sort of thing that 
Dreiser enjoys in his leisure moments. It may be 
what awakens the sluggish admiration of Chambers. 
As for the critics, is it despair of the G. A. N. that 
moves them to this wonderful praise? Is it that, 
they cannot resist their little joke? Is it that the 
critics, sated with the brilliant superficiality of 
Chambers' school, mistake the stigmata of medioc- 
rity for the sober penetrations of genius? 



OOMEWHAT OUT OF THE ZENITH THERE DESCENDED 

but yesterday a whole grist of an elfish and original 
book entitled in the most pertinent manner Forms 
Suggested for Telegraph Messages. And this de- 
scent was in the very nick of time; for, after a 
period of inutility, the telegraph wires that string 
th s country like an arch-lute had just become once 
more a possible feature of the national life. It is 
marvelously interesting to speculate on the necessity 
for these suggested forms: whether the mind of 
man, during that intercalary period, lost the trick 
of formulating a message, or whether only such a 
judicious bit of publicity could recall business and 
pleasure to the old, ante-bellum uses of telegraphy. 
In any case here is a book of forms appropriate 
to all the minor occasions. The festival days and 
the days of nativity and demise, congratulatory 
burbles and every sort of condolence, all are phras- 
ed for you in generous amplitude and particular 
taste. There is no lack of messages, either for 
young or old, in a strictly social sense. If there is 
a lack at all, it will surely be found in the omission 
of major instances for the man of large affairs. He 
is indeed neglected. Of course, a second volume 
may be projected in the sum of time, and th's 
should comprise finger-tip messages for sellers in 



jute and junk, for buyers in oils and eggs, and that 
sort. Such messages, in order to be commensurable 
with the life-and-death rapidity of business, should 
be numbered wisely and a book of them issued to 
each of the dramatis personae. Touching jute, or 
eggs, in a godlike deal, it would be sufficient to 
send the number of the right message. Let the 
other man consult his book for meanings! 

All this however is but a prefiguration of the 
vfuture. Much has already been accomplished in a 
really big way, and the country at large is pleased 
to reflect a smile of gratitude. For instance, a* 
parent (or parents) aware of the matrimonial de- 
signs of a son or daughter, may cull and put on 
the wires a message l.ke this: 

My (our) deep concern. I (we) am (are) eagerly await- 
ing your decision, although I (we) realize that nothing I 
(we) say or do can (will) (ought to) make any difference. 
You are a man (woman) and you know her (him) better 
than I (we) . 

Note: Such a message may be sent "most cheap- 
ly" as a Night Letter of fifty words at the cost of a 
"ten-word full rate message"; or it may be sent as 
a Day Letter of fifty words for one and one-half 
the cost of the conventional message. The sender 
will feel his purse. See introduction. 

How noble is this expression to either parent of 
a new-born child: 

I (we) am (are) delighted to hear of the birth of your 

first (second) (third) (fourth) son (daughter). I (we) 

congratulate its (his) (her) mother (father). Kiss it 
(him) (her) forme (us). My (our) love. 

Or this timely condescendence of words for Thanks- 
giving Day: 

That I (we) am (are) separated from my (our) own (ours) 
is a cause of sorrow to me (us), and though I (we) cannot 
be with my (our) friend (friends) today, I (we) hope my 
(our) dear one (ones) is (are) thinking of me (us) as I 
(we) think of them (him) (her). 

At a loss for the proper message in the event of a 
person's succeeding in life, nothing could more 
featly envisage the moment than the following: 

I (we) congratulate you on your school (college) (poli- 
tical) (professional) success. I (we) am (are) justly 
proud of my (our) son (daughter) (friend) (congressman) 
(doctor). I (we) hear on every side only expressions of 
satisfaction. You have the support of the best element, 
of whom (which) I (we) am (are) one (ones).

Communications 

CONRAD AIKEN Is QUESTIONED 

SIR: It is not difficult for a contemporary to tell 
his sister-poet that she abides our question. Nor 
would it be difficult for Amy Lowell, if she also 
were equipped with the new tool of criticism, analyt- 
ic psychology, to prove that Conrad Aiken is in as 
dubious a position as he makes her out to be. Mr. 
Aiken speaks with scientific accuracy when he 
points out that poetry must not lean either too 
much toward the unconscious or the conscious 
mind, toward inspiration or control ; but that, start- 
ing as a definite compulsion, as a definite eruption 
of mood, of sound perhaps and image, from the 
unconscious, it must almost simultaneously be 
shaped by the poet as it comes, so that there is a 
cooperation. I am not, of course, quoting him, 
but rather interpreting his penetrative remarks. 

His criticism intrigued me to go buy his last 
book, The Charnel Rose, and read Senlin. And I 
enjoyed reading Senlin. I didn't at all seem to be 
reading direct poetry, but rather listening to the 
echoes of poetry; and these echoes held flashes of 
meaning which disappeared in repetitive reverba- 
tions, moony and eerie, thudding all about me, and 
leaving me at the end with just the sort of over- 
tones that a powerful but unremembered dream 
leaves in the morning. And I also felt tired. 

Then I saw the gulf which separates Amy Lowell 
from Conrad Aiken, and which would perhaps make 
it difficult for them to care much for the work of 
the other. Using the words in their purely sub- 
jective sense, I should say that Aiken is a feminine 
poet, and Amy Lowell a masculine. I mean that 
Aiken leans over backward toward the unconscious ; 
comes pretty near being that flute he speaks of, 
which the unconscious uses for its sounding phan- 
tasies. He, like Poe and the lyric Shelley, has a 
passive and acquiescent attitude toward the Logos, 
and allows himself to be an instrument. Amy 
Lowell goes to the other extreme. When she says 
she is waiting for an idea, that does not necessarily 
mean that she ignores inspiration, mood. It prob- 
ably means thatthe mood is there, shadowy, vague, 
with all the nonsense formation through which the 
unconscious speaks. What she wants is a tool of 
the intellect with which to seize on the treasure of 
the mood and wrestle it into good human shape, 
full of meaning, "sharp and vivid. She has, in 
other words, a more aggressive attitude toward 
the unconscious, a masculine attitude. As Ibsen 
said: "He struggles with his marble blocks, I 
dare say . . . and wins the fight in the end 
. . . subdues and masters his material." 

Here are two extremes. There is, also, a third 
way. Walt Whitman hints at it when he says : 

I believe in you my soul, the other I am 

must not abase itself to you, 
And you must not be abased to the other. 

Here is the suggestion of both receptivity and 
conscious mastery, a recognition that while the un- 



conscious has great values, the conscious ego also 
has great values, and that the greatest expression 
must necessarily be a merger of both. And this, I 
take it, is what distinguishes great art from minor 
art: that perfect fusion of the internal and external, 
dark enchantment with sunlight on it. ... 

It is a temptation to the crt c, if he happens to be 
an artist, to exclude his own opposite from a 
niche in his hall of fame. Conrad Aiken ought to 
be a better psychologist; for as a poet, he also 
abides our question. JAMES OPPENHEIM. 

[EDITORS' NOTE: In fairness to Mr. Aiken it 
should be explained that the title of his review, 
Miss Lowell Abides Our Question, was substituted 
by the editors for his own title, A Poet Adds a 
Cubit, which seemed to them ambiguous. Also, 
that the proofreader made his second sentence begin 
"Used by the intelligent" instead of: 

Used by the unintelligent the phrase is taken to mean that 
whatever the poet writes is "inspired"; that he cannot 
possibly obtain any control of the strange instrument which 
has been given him. 



SIR: A great part of Mr. Oppenheim's objection 
to my treatment of Amy Lowell's book was no 
doubt due to the title, and to the error in 
proofreading which committed me to a statement 
that the poet "cannot possibly obtain control of 
the strange instrument which has been given him"; 
but I should like also, if I may, to touch on one or 
two other points which he raises, for I am inclined 
to think that even despite these misleadings Mr. 
Oppenheim, had he read my review a little more 
neutrally, need not so completely have miscon- 
ceived my attitude. In the very first paragraph I 
think I made it clear that while "there must always 
be at bottom this daemon of the subconscious, to 
set the waters darkly in motion" nevertheless "the 
poet should, and can, take his part in the affair," 
and further that a poet "grows more or less in 
proportion to his achievement of this control." 
This should have made it clear enough, I think, 
that it was not my intention to be merely an apolog- 
ist for the "possessed" type of poet, or to belittle 
the "conscious" artist, so much as to examine the 
particular case of Amy Lowell, and to demonstrate 
not that the "conscious" artist is the inferior type 
but merely that as a "conscious" artist Amy Lowell 
is not wholly successful. In the course of a review 
of John Gould Fletcher's last book I once asked: 
"Are these lyrics an earnest of further development, 
and will Mr. Fletcher pass to that other plane of 
art, that of the possessor artist, the artist who fore- 
sees and forges, who calculates his effects?" In 
the course of a review of Alan Seeger I once re- 
marked: "There is, of course, another type of 
ar ti s t the type to which Shakespeare, Euripides, 
Balzac, Turgenev, and Meredith belong which de- 
velops the pleasure principle and the reality prin- 
ciple side by side, achieving the perfect balance 
which we call greatness." I could quote other 



448 



THE DIAL 



November 15 



statements in the same tenor, but these are perhaps 
enough to show that even if my temperament is, as 
Mr. Oppenheim says it is, that of "passive and ac- 
quiescent attitude toward the Logos," I am not 
very much the dupe of it. I have more often re- 
proached contemporary poets for lack of "control" 
than for lack of emotivity; certainly as often. 

"It is a temptation to the critic," says Mr. Op- 
penheim, "if he happens to be an artist, to exclude 
his own opposite from a niche in his hall of fame. 
Conrad Aiken ought to be a better psychologist: 
for as a poet, he also abides our question." True: 
but Mr. Oppenheim hardly puts it strongly enough. 
It is not a temptation, it is a necessity; one cannot 
like what one does not like, nor dislike what one 
does not dislike, though one can of course per- 
ceive and confess one's limitations. What sins I 
commit as a result of this necessity I commit with 
my eyes open, and am willing to suffer for: I am 
not so naive as Mr. Oppenheim thinks. May I 
refer him to the preface of my book on contem- 
porary poetry, where the entire question is dis- 
cussed with fearful candor? CONRAD AIKEN. 



EDUCATION AND ESTHETICS IN ART MUSEUMS 

SIR: In THE DIAL for September 20, the courteous 
and appreciative reviewer of a book called Museum 
Ideals of Purpose and Method, by I. Gilman, writes 
that museum management has passed through two 
phases in recent years. Through the Victorian Era 
of Ruskin and the Tate Gallery the importance 
ascribed to the intellectual content of works of art 
influenced museums toward an educational theory 
of their function; while in the present era of Mor- 
ris and the Japanese the importance ascribed to the 
decorative content of works of art in its turn influ- 
ences museums toward an esthetic theory. 

This historical allusion tends to obscure the 
theoretic distinction which it seeks to illuminate. 
In the reported language of the poet laureate of 
England, the esthetic theory does not "give a damn" 
for the difference between the intellectual and the 
decorative content of works of art. It claims for 
any and every form of artistic intention precedence 
in museums over all other interests that may attach 
to works of art, among them the educational. The 
theoretic distinction in question corresponds not to 
the difference of one content from another the 
representative from the ornamental but that of 
all content from that which is not content at all. 
It will be better for art and its museums when 
people come to realize that the paramount purpose 
of. the exhibition of a work of art is to forward 
public apprehension of what the art'.st said in it, 
whatever that was; and that to forward public ap- 
prehension of what archaeologists or others have 
said about it is a secondary purpose purely. This 
simple truth is the esthetic theory insistently reiter- 
ated, as the reviewer notes, by "I. Gilman" in Mus- 
eum Ideals. BENJAMIN IVES GILMAN. 



Notes on New Books 

JEREMY. By Hugh Walpole. 304 pages. 
Doran. 

Jeremy is delightfully compounded of memory 
and imagination. Probably every author longs to 
write one book that will preserve the precious and 
incommunicable recollections of his early years, 
and yet give his fancy free rein as well. The auto- 
biographical novel is frequently the best work of a 
writer's career, because it not only reflects life with 
fidelity, but irradiates it with love. Jeremy shows 
realism and affectionate fancy, but it is not so im- 
pressive as Walpole's Russian novels, or such a 
mordant study of English life as The Duchess of 
Wrexe. This record of a childhood in a quiet 
English home almost thirty years ago is given with 
sympathy and charm. The eight-year-old boy is a 
personality to be doted on and respected, even 
though his elders often fail to understand him. He 
seems more vigorous, more appealing, in the first 
chapters than in some of the later ones, where the 
reader wishes he could push things along a bit. The 
book, in f?ct, drags in the middle a fact whiah the 
author himself half -concedes, in admitting that Jere- 
my's life is unadvent- ..us. He ascribes that fact 
to the phalanx of spinsters and clergymen who sur- 
round him. To Tom Sawyer and Penrod, Jeremy's 
lot would seem tame! No boys to play with, no- 
body to fight save the Dean's hateful Ernest! Still, 
there's Hamlet, that tragi-comic pup, for compan- 
ionship, and Jeremy lives largely in his spkit, to 
which impregnable castle no nurse or maiden aunt 
or curate can pursue him. A grown-up Jeremy 
would be greatly worth knowing, and we may hope 
that Mr. Walpole will tell about him some day. 
In the meantime, children and adults will enjoy 
the present book for its humor, its cleverness of 
character drawing, and its understanding of the 
child heart. 

HEARTBREAK HOUSE, GREAT CATHERINE AND 
PLAYLETS OF THE WAR. By Bernard Shaw. 
295 pages. Brentano. 

Ten years ago Bernard Shaw had no rival in 
the modern English drama. Today his only rival 
is the self that had mellowed into maturity before 
Misalliance was written. It is in comparison with 
his Major Barbaric strength and sureness and vital- 
ity that the Shaw of 1919 seems a little jaded and 
conventional. For Heartbreak House has neither the 
resolute consecutiveness of the philosophic dialogue 
nor the mobile adaptation of phrase to plot which 
marks the genuine drama: it is indeed merely a 
continuation of that interminable weekend which 
began in Getting Married and paused with a shriek 
of desperation in Misalliance. This, Mr. Shaw 
might urge, is no reflection upon his dramatic 
abilities: it is rather a criticism of that segment of 
leisured society which he essays to depict. Such 



1919 



THE DIAL 



449 



a defense might extenuate the selection of materials, 
let us grant, but it does not account for the failure 
in manipulating them. Mr. Shaw cannot escape 
the responsibility for his present dramatic inepti- 
tude by calling Heartbreak House a fantasia in the 
Russian manner. Chekhov drew with convincing 
lifelikeness a society in which the characters were 
molded most subtly into symbols: Shaw has created 
only a caricature because his symbols are cast 
nakedly as characters. Ellie is not a girl: she is 
the younger generation; Lady Utterword is not a 
woman: she is the ruling class; Captain Shotover 
is nt a skipper: he is the embodiment of Jovean 
wisdom, made muzzy and incalculable by age. 
Passing from the flashing exposition of the preface 
to the titillating chatter of Heartbreak House one 
feels that the sparkling wine of reality has been 
translated into the colored water of amateur theatric- 
als. The shorter plays, especially Great Catherine, 
come off rather better; but the volume as a whole 
leaves the impression that Mr. Shaw has grown 
out of his medium, and continues to write within 
its conventions only because he is so thoroughly 
adjusted to them. It is time that he returned to 
the incursive freedoms of the journalistic novel. 
If only to set a pace for the younger generation in 
the use of heroic prose the satirist of Heartbreak 
House and Horseback Hall should take up again 
the work of his nonage. His new plays must risk 
comparison with his old ones: a new novel would, 
on the contrary, jolt the literary stars out of their 
orbits and deflect the light of a dozen established 
reputations. 

PINK ROSES. By Gilbert Cannan. 335 pages. 
Doran. 

When the long arm of coincidence can be seen 
in the process of stretching, its elbow bending and 
its fingers curling to drag characters into a plot, 
the sterling quality of a book is necessarily weaken- 
ed. Gilbert Cannan wraps his new bouquet of Pink 
Roses with the too-heavy tinfoil of a plot. If 
people would just sensibly content themselves with 
the character analysis of an idealist left in war-rid- 
den London trying to understand what it is all about ! 
But no, they insist on a story; so Trevor Mathew 
must be bound by a plot and compelled to meet 
just those people his author chooses for him. Yet, 
despite the fact that Mr. Cannan gives creaky warn- 
ing that Trevor must meet a particular character 
when and how Mr. Cannan chooses, and then pro- 
ceeds to let them match ideas on the world and its 
future, he has succeeded in expressing a phase of 
the war which has escaped even the most dilligent 
and discerning reporters. For he has shown us 
in cross-section the stodgy Times-reading barrister, 
the prostitute, the specialist called to the war minis- 
try, the rejected man, and the adolescent youths of 
both sexes, in their attitude toward the London of 
war time. The attempt to interpret the flaming 
present in terms of a past that has failed to realize 



its ideals is given to youth only; nay to the chosen 
youth of the day. And they find that there is no 
connection. The aiders are lost in the details of 
the moment. This is Mr. Cannan's conclusion. A 
new social order is peering over the horizon, 
an order in which yesterday's ideals may be- 
come today's realities. Only a fiery few need 
understand; the others, as always, will drink deep 
of the new day and follow without quite knowing 
why. 

THE CALL OF THE SOIL. By Adrien Bertrand. 
227 pages. Lane. 

It is one thing to believe that a particular war 
is worth while for its objects. It is quite another 
to believe that War as such is worth while for it- 
self. Propaganda to the contrary, few people will 
deny that even in the early ecstasy of 1914 theVe 
were some Germans who regarded the war as an 
ill means to a great end; and on the other hand no 
reader of The Call of the Soil crowned by Ana- 
tole France and others with the Prix Goneourt for 
1916 can fail to realize that in France the worth 
of war for its own sake has not been altogether 
unappreciated. 

In this war novel by an author who himself met 
death in the war, one reads : 

The moral grandeur of war . . . consists of making 
us live with the idea of death . . . Considered in it- 
self, war is humanity's crowning disgrace, but those who 
can read in the hearts of the men who urge [wage?] it 
will see in war the saHctification of the race. 

And this: 

. . . Never before has so much beauty and nobility of 
character been cast like grain before the quickening winds 
that breathe over the land. 

Not alone for its salutary effect upon her sons, 
but because it imposed upon the country a regime 
of "method, discipline and order," the war was a 
blessing to France. Germany had learned this les- 
son, and the learning had prepared her to take 
such a place in world affairs as was once held by 
the France of Louis XIV. Hopefully the war 
might leave the French state again "as rigidly 
ordered as the gardens of Versailles" its citizens 
"not men at all, but part of the soil of France." 
By his very nature, of course, man is suited to this 
scheme of life; whether he worships before the 
might of Heaven, or bows to the inscrutable laws 
of destiny and reason, he is above all "a submissive 
animal," easily absorbed and completely lost in 
a nation which had learned on the battlefield "the 
virtues of self-sacrifice, enthusiasm and discipline." 

It is unfortunate that this novelization of the 
theories of militarism and the Great State was not 
imported into the United States while the war for 
peace and democracy was still in progress. At that 
time it might have served as a hardly believable 
warning against a coming cataclysm. Today the 
book is no more than a mournful and mocking "I 
told you so!"

SONIA MARRIED. By Stephen McKenna. 370 
pages. Dor an. 

David O'Rane, blinded in battle, returns to Lon- 
don "prepared to practise the Sermon on the Mount 
in a tweed suit and soft hat." Since only a prig 
would attempt to make Christianity effective in 
more peculiar kind of costume, Raney might have 
made out of his existence something more than a 
sonnet sequence on The New Life had it not been 
for Sonia. Raney and Sonla had been chums for 
many a long year before the war, while the Oak- 
leighs and the Daintons and the Lorings dawdled 
through adolescence and lapsed, after a bout at 
the University, into the feverish vapidities of Lon- 
don night life. Sonia had flouted Jim Loring out of 
an engagement and It was only after a career that 
compromised her reputation with everyone but 
Raney that, in a wave of tender feeling, she espous- 
ed our blind hero. With Sonia Married, we find 
the couple established in The Sanctuary, an old 
brick-and-timber warehouse, "near the Tate gal- 
lery." David O'Rane, in translating Christianity 
into English, evolves a sort of new feudalism, paral- 
lel though the author apparently does not sense 
it to the new monasticism of the University Settle- 
ment, and the large hall that one enters from Mill- 
bank Road is indiscrim nately filled with exotic 
flowers from the House of Commons and the coun- 
try house and the indigenous garbage of Hyde 
Park and the Embankment. Food and shelter and 
the society of benignant thoughts Raney offers 
everyone, and while his wife's appetite for life is at 
first sharpened by the new medley of odors and 
tastes he introduces, she presently sickens for the 
more solitary pleasures of connubial idolatry; and 
on maliciously fancying that Raney has become the 
lover of Hilda Meryon, his secretary, she begins 
a flirtation with two men, a poet and a parliamen- 
tarian, which ends in her becoming the mistress of 
Grayle, the parliamentarian an ugly "arriviste." 
When Grayle, in the pursuit of his governmental 
ambitions, shortly casts Sonia off, she runs into 
concealment, is discovered alone and ill, and is taken 
back to The Sanctuary against her wishes under 
orders from that impregnable idealist, her husband. 
Realizing that he had bluntly hacked at the fine 
edges of his marital relations, Raney is prepared to 
forgive Sonia's hazardous departures, when he is 
informed that she is with child, as a result of her 
liaison with Grayle. The book ends with David 
in the act of bravely putting the mother's newborn 
infant under a parental wing which flutters, some- 
what uncertainly, over the mother also. Fill out 
this bare outl ne of adventure with several attempts 
to indulge the stirring barbarities of homicide, add 
a large number of deft and circumstant al conversa- 
tions about the meaning of the war and its con- 
duct, brighten the canvas here and there with recog- 
nizable figures of historic importance, and you 
will have the quality of the facile Mr. McKenna's 



latest novel. Sonia Married falls in the line of the 
brilliant Coningsby; but whereas Disraeli recogniz- 
ed the existence of two nations, young Mr. McKenna 
seems conscious only of one. Doubtless the patter 
and glitter of Mr. McKenna's world accounts in a 
measure for his early arrival at popularity. And 
in due time, unless his roots tap deeper soil, it will 
explain his equally early disappearance. 

A BOOK OF PRINCETON VERSE: II, 1919. Edit- 
ed by Henry Van Dyke, Morris William Croll, 
Maxwell Struthers Burt, and James Creese, Jr. 
179 pages. Princeton University Press. 

"It is surprising, and I must confess refreshing," 
remarks Dr. Van Dyke in the preface, "to find in 
this collection so few pieces wr.tten in what is call- 
ed vers libre the Bolshevism of poetry." A less 
partial critic might be equally surprised at the un- 
academic freedom of these young Princeton poets. 
Fully a fourth of the writers represented are at 
home in the newer forms, and even those who are 
outwardly more conventional show a tendency to 
vitalize their work, transgressing the rules which 
were gospel to the Doctor and his earlier contem- 
poraries. Only in his own poems easily the worst 
of the volume does the spirit of the Victorians sur- 
vive in its entirety. 

There is no outstanding figure among these poets 
like Stephen Vincent Benet at Yale to break 
the pattern of the book. One has a tendency to dis- 
regard the signatures ; most of the verse might easily 
have been the work of one man. If John Peale 
Bishop excels the others, it is not because he differs 
from them, but rather that he carries their thoughts 
to more definite conslusions. Like the others he is 
attached deeply to the courts and meadows of 
Princeton. He reacts definitely like them to the 
mingled monotony and glory of the war. He too 
must disquiet his professors sometimes by the 
force of his poetic convictions. In fostering this 
volume, Dr. Van Dyke stands somewhat in the 
position of the hen who has raised a brood of duck- 
lings. He urges gently, he admonishes, but never- 
theless his charges venture into deep waters, leaving 
him standing alone and ridiculous on the shore. 

DR. JONATHAN. By Winston Churchill. 159 
pages. Macmillan. 

Despite his avowed impatience with preaching, 
Mr. Churchill cannot res st the temptation to pulpi- 
teer considerably when he turns dramatist. In the 
present instance he is so intent upon his message, 
and so fearful lest its import elude the reader, 
that he keeps it spinning constantly through three 
acts, to the exclusion of any glint of humor and 
to the partial eclipse of the human element in his 
materials. Every voice that is raised is raised on 
one side or the other of its central thesis, and 
everybody seems to be busy making an occasion for 
something more to be added to the discussion. As

a contr'bution to the literature of modern industry, 
the play has its function, but as stuff of the theatre, 
we doubt if even its author was much surprised 
when "several managers politely declined to pro- 
duce it." 

We are introduced to a firm-handed, conservative 
industrial capitalist of New England, fair in his 
deal ngs if judged by his own standards and train- 
ing, but resolutely opposed to labor unions. Under 
war production pressure, the men in his plant vote 
to strike. The capitalist holds out until his son, 
fighting in the belief that "the issue of this war 
is industrial democracy, without which political 
democracy is a farce," returns a shell-shock victim. 
Dr. Jonathan, a humanitarian scientist, tells the 
old fire-eater that he must meet the men's demands 
to save his son's life. The restoration of industrial 
peace upon a basis of parental sacrifice is perhaps 
too spec alized a solution to point the way out of 
the modern chaos, but Mr. Churchill drives home 
his thesis, -notwithstanding. 

The weakness of Dr. Jonathan lies in the frail 
infusion of vitality into cardboard characters, whose 
outlines and whose work are accurately cut out for 
them by polemic shears. The industrial unrest, in 
its complexity and its baffling undercurrents, eludes 
even the most sincere attempt at three-act solution. 

SMALL THINGS. By Margaret Deland. 326 
pages. Appleton. . 

Small Things is a transcript of one phase of 
the war as seen through a woman's eyes. Yet, 
such are Mrs. Deland's gifts that, though she 
does not seek the firing line nor haunt the hos- 
pitals, we have a sense that here at last, in her 
gay reminiscences of small events, her reports 
of conversations with American soldiers and with 
French civilians we have the war. Here, also, in 
narrative form, is a capable woman's evaluation 
of the devoirs of self-sacrifice paid by France. 
All of the tales of atrocity are compressed into 
two or three grisly chapters, dripping with blood 
and horror. For the rest Mrs. Deland accepts 
German cruelty as the horrid symptom of a patho- 
logical and degenerate child. Ever and again she 
sets the scene for a grim story, circles about it 
uncertainly, hesitates to set her teeth into it, and 
veers off artfully with a dramatic: "But I will 
not tell you what they did . . ." or "I have 
spared you one incredible detail," and is there- 
upon divert'ngly reminded of an amusing occur- 
rence that happened at the Y. M. C. A. but the 
other evening. For the mood of Small Things, 
despite an occasional taint of sentimentalism 
Mrs. Deland had the greatest difficulty in realiz- 
ing that war heroes are jnot necessarily "heroic" 
is one of sanity and wholesome good humor. 
The volume is a salutary antidote for the grisly 
war-sensationalism of a Rupert Hughes. 



BODY AND RAIMENT. By Eunice Tietjens. 83 
pages. Knopf. 

The excellences of Mrs. Tietjens' latest volume 
make one the more regretful that she has been con- 
tent to stuff it out with ineptitudes which come with 
a shock of disappointment. Like the little girl 
of proverbial extravagances, when she is good she 
is very very good, but when she is bad she is hor- 
rid. She is good when she goes her own way, when 
for all her "complex schooling" she chooses one 
interesting road and yields to another singular 
mood. She is bad when she lets a facility with 
rhyme and metre lead her into journalistic banali- 
ties, or, to a lesser degree, when she allows her ad- 
miration for Sara Teasdale's work to influence her 



own. 



What one feels in this volume is more the things 
the a.uthor is striving for, than the emotion that 
impels her. The raiment is lovely and often origin- 
al, but the power and insistence, the living marvel 
of the body is rather suggested than realized. Her 
most vivid moments come when she does the less 
ambitious thing, as in many of her love lyr'cs, in 
her poems in hospital, and, curiously enough, in 
the charming translations from the Japanese with 
which she concludes. Her war poems approach 
this level, but always stop just short of it. It may 
easily be that here the emotion was too intense for 
expression. 

One of the curiosities of Mrs. Tietjens' method is 
her use of metrics. Her vers libre is seldom vers 
libre. She simply cuts her lines according to 
rhymes, leaving her metrical scheme intact, so that 
the effect is that of blank verse with internal 
rhymes. The strong feeling for metre may be at once 
what hinders her from absolute power in her larger 
efforts and what makes her slighter poems evocative. 
A sterner critical sense is what Mrs. Tietjens most 
needs. The material worthy of its employment is 
in her work. 

THE SILVER AGE. By Temple Scott. 216 
pages. Scott & Seltzer, New York. 

Although this volume is launched in a fireside 
mood of reverie, with the first essay which lends 
its title to the collection cast in a mood of quiet 
reminiscence, there is an emphatic change of tone 
for the major portion of it. Most of the sketches 
studies of character rather than deliberate attempts 
at story are filled with the breath of youth, with 
an eager spirit of world conquest through the crea- 
tion of beauty. There is no sighing over lost golden 
ages, nor lost silver ages either, but rather a clarion 
note of challenge to the oncoming workers. In 
pursuit of this theme, which turns the last of three 
of four sketches in the book into practical art sym- 
posiums, the theory of esthetics, and the theory of 
post-impressionism, and a half dozen kindred sub- 
jects in the field of art are thoroughly raked over 
the coals. Mr. Scott succeeds in putting fresh vital-

ity in certain rather frayed tenets, and they are 
borne in upon the reader's consciousness by the 
sanity and clarity of their expression. The two 
sketches entitled An Odd Volume and Any Vinders 
to Mend? are wrought with fine feeling and a 
sense for character drawing which brings them into 
clear relief. The old book peddler and the Polish 
glazier are deftly visualized and interpreted. 

A group of artists and critics, arguing the mean- 
ing of art, and beauty, and "the Idea" these pro- 
vide the symposium of Fifth Avenue and the Boule- 
vard Saint-Michel, and they reappear in subsequent 
pages, elaborating upon what they have already 
said. The ai'j-. r manages these scenes with skill, 
and builds up his artistic theories out of them. 
What he has to say is of a positive quality a mess- 
age which cannot be heard too often. 

EDUCATION AND ARISTOCRACY IN RUSSIA. By 
Daniel Bell Leary. 127 pages. University of 
Buffalo. 

The first test to be applied to any book that ad- 
ventures a controversial field is the test of intellec- 
tual honesty. Must allowance be made for a spec- 
ial prejudice openly confessed? Or does the fur- 
tive misd'rection of emphasis present a more diffi- 
cult problem? It goes without saying that this 
inquiry has special importance in the case of any 
book dealing nearly or remotely with problems of 
the present in Russia. Tested then for sincerity, 
this monograph on Education and Aristocracy in 
Russia proves itself, honest to a degree. In fact 
it exhibits that earnestness and sincerity which is 
characteristic of the common run of university 
theses written for the most part by young people 
who are unconscious of their own special interests, 
and have not yet been set upon by the special in- 
terests of others. 

But to say that the writer refrains from abusing 
his abundant material is not the same thing as say- 
ing that he uses it to best advantage. On the con- 
trary it happens that in this particular case honesty 
of intent is coupled with inadequacy of method. 
It must be admitted that the author was faced with 
a problem of monumental proportions. In fact he 
dared to set himself the task of writing an institu- 
tional history the economic, social, and political 
background of which was practically unknown 
to his readers. From internal evidence, one may 
infer that to begin with he intended to treat the 
educational system practically without reference 
to its surroundings; that he discovered the absolute 
necessity of tying education up to somethnig; and 
that the political history of the country was finally 
chosen as a connecting thread because it supplied a 
most convenient scheme for the chronological ar- 
rangement of the collected material. The result 
is a dreary narrative, running "from the origins 
to the Bolsheviki," which associates education with 
the autocracy and the autocracy with nothing. 



Naturally one should not lay upon this little 
book the requirements set for the history of a 
country. On the other hand it is safe to say that 
the growth of the "mir" or commune, the emancipa- 
tion of serfs, the land problem, and the emergence 
of the industrial class have at least as much to 
do with the development of educational institu- 
tions in Russia as have the several wars and re- 
volts which are here dealt with at the expense of 
a considerable number of pages. When all is said 
and done, this monograph, badly organized and 
badly written as it is, exhibits as its most serious 
fault a characteristic that is common not only to 
most histories of education but to education itself 
the fault of remoteness from the life of the 
people. It is just this characteristic of detachment 
that the Russian social revolutionists have set them- 
selves to eliminate from the educational system. It 
remains for other books than this to recount the 
success or failure of the enterprise. 

MAIN CURRENTS OF SPANISH LITERATURE. By 
J. D. Ford. 284 pages. Holt. 

CERVANTES. By Rudolph Schevill. 388 pages. 
Duffield. 

These two books bear witness to the present 
absorbing interest in Spain's literary treasure. D>. 
Ford deals largely with the entire field from the 
heroic tradition to the latest hate-inspired poems of 
the Spanish-American states. He traces happily 
the tales of El Cid and King Alfonso through epic 
and ballad, touches sympathetically upon lyric 
poetry, and gives to the golden years of the drama, 
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some 
of the best analysis and criticism in the book. Lope, 
Calderos, and Corneille who took freely from the 
Spanish and bettered what he borrowed are all dis- 
cussed briefly yet with a literary acumen which 
bears conviction. Now and then one feels the 
judgment a trifle dictatorial, but in the main Dr. 
Ford's decisiveness is an asset. With a vast field t 
cover, Dr. Ford must needs be brief, but he has 
fulfilled his avowed purpose of surveying the main 
currents of Spanish literature.. 

For Cervantes it is, naturally, more worth while 
to turn to Dr. Schevill's biography, in which al- 
most four hundred pages are devoted to .a scholarly 
consideration of the man and his work. Cervantes' 
pitiful poverty, his slavery and imprisonment, and 
his crippled left arm are insisted upon only to 
bring out more clearly the indomitable spirit of 
the man who transmuted his wisdom into a master- 
piece of laughter. Dr. Schevill has used to the 
full the latest discoveries concerning Cervantes. In 
this respect his book is distinctly an addition to 
the list of biographies previously written. There is 
more detailed knowledge here and less brilliant 
conjecture than in Fitzmaurice-Kelley's classic on 
Spanish literature. Dr. Schevill realizes the worth 
of his jewel and has set it solidly if not brilliantly.

THE OLD FREEDOM 

By FRANCIS NEILSON 

One gets upon mental tiptoes in reading this book 



THE CHICAGO POST says: 

"If the reader wishes a clear ex- 
position of the main schools of revo- 
lutionary thought, if he wishes to 
know definitely what Socialism is or 
isn't, or the difference between So- 
cialism and Syndicalism, or what 
freedom really means in terms 
of man's actual life, let him read this 
eminently readable book. 

"Mr. Neilson comes to us without 
intellectual ostentation and with no 
medicine case full of political or 
legislative cure-alls. He meets us 
on the ground of ordinary life and 
even permits us to retain much of 
our old conservative intellectual bag- 
gage. 

"Mr. Neilson analyses Syndicalism, 
Socialism, Communism very clearly 
and sympathetically. But he has a 
simpler program a program which 
does not disrupt society with a view 
to remodeling it." 

LLEWELLYN JONES. 

THE NEW YORK EVENING ' 
POST says: 

"A provocative little volume." 

THE BALTIMORE SUN says: 

"A very exceptional book strongly 
recommended to all interested in the 
economic foundations of yesterday, 
today and tomorrow." 



The President and others pro- 
claim "the new freedom" as a 
social and economic panacea. 
This is a book about 

The Old Freedom 

Let the state take monopoly values 
and free industry from taxation; 
give community created values to 
the community and give the indi- 
vidual the full value of his prod- 
uct. Thus will natural rights be 
restored and economic freedom 
be regained. This is 

The Old Freedom 

This study of economic control 
by political means, this challenge 
to panaceas , this vision of democ- 
racy is an important contribution 
toward the solution of present 
problems. 



THE NATION says: 

"Mr. Neilson's work cannot fail to 
interest the great body of our Amer- 
ican people whose instincts are just- 
ly and sanely conservative, to whom 
Socialism and Toryism are alike re- 
pugnant, and who are wide enough 
awake to know that our social struc- 
ture is not yet secure and that it 
must be made secure even if we 
have to take some radical steps." 

THE LOS ANGELES TIMES says: 
"One gets upon mental tip-toes in 
reading this book. It repays care- 
ful reading and repays with large 
interest." 

UNITY says: 

"'The Old Freedom'" is a splen- 
did touchstone for the sincerity of 
several classes of men: we should 
like to know what the leaders of 
labor, the representative employ- 
ers, and the advocates of the pro- 
gressive socialization of industry 
think of this book. It will greatly 
simplify their thinking if only they 
sincerely want their problem solved. 
If they want to temporize, they will 
find nothing but discouragement in 
the book, for it holds up before them 
the utter famire of every such at- 
tempt in England." 

THE ARGONAUT says: 

"We are not likely to hear this 
idea more capably presented."

Colas Breugnon, by Romain Holland (302 pages; Holt), 
is the long Rabelaisian soliloquy of an honest Bur- 
gundian, a wood-carver by trade, a hearty eater, a long 
drinker, a stout fighter, a devout skeptic, and a lover 
whose restrained tenderness lost him his first sweet- 
heart and threw him into the hands of an acerbic woman 
whom he married in order to escape. There is a seven- 
teenth century richness and profusion in the tale that 
reminds one of the sort of carving Colas must have 
turned his hand to.

ed on page 448. 

Sonia Married, by Stephen McKenna (370 pages; Dor- 
an), is reviewed on page 450. 

Pink Roses, by Gilbert Cannan (335 pages; Doran), is 
reviewed on page 449. 

Brute Gods, by Louis Wilkinson (335 pages; Knopf), is 
another of the author's brilliant sorties in the realm 
of sardonic wit. This time the sex-snobbery of Eng- 
lish middle-class domestic life offers the target. 
Against the lecherous self-righteousness of middle age 
are set the vivid emotions of adolescent awakening. 
Sophisticated readers take notice! 

Consequences, by E. M. Delafield (350 pages; Knopf), 
might best be described as the inevitable consequence 
of the author's overrefinement of analytic introspection. 
This story will give nothing new to readers of Zella 
Sees Herself. It is virtually Zella reincarnated. Miss 
Delafield's earlier novels were reviewed by Katharine 
Anthony in THE DIAL for March 8. 

Mrs. Marden, by Robert Hichens (325 pages; Doran), 
forsakes the romantic field for the psychological in 
order to depict a woman's reactions from a war be- 
reavement, first by resorting to the solace of spiritual- 
ism, and finally by an inner self-mastery. A restrain- 
ed piece of writing, with a genuine grip on its mater- 
ials. 

Two Men, by Alfred Ollivant (314 pages; Doubleday, 
Page). Two classes of society in oae family, two 
brothers with antagonistic inheritances, and one woman 
barred from every class these in an English coast 
town make an interesting character novel. The hero's 
marriage settles only one of the problems: the sequel 
is said to be forthcoming. 

The Siamese Cat, by Henry Milner Rideout (223 pages; 
Duffield), is a reissue of the mystery yarn which in 
1907 startled us with its evidence that in the leisurely 
Orient the author of Admiral's Light and Wild Justice 
had somehow contracted a quite Western speed mania 
from which he has never fully recovered. 

Transplanted, by Gertrude Atherton (339 pages; Dodd, 
Mead), is a reissue of one of Mrs. Atherton's earlier 
novels, published some years ago under the title of 
American Wives and English Husbands.

In welcoming " The Great Desire " as a notable American work, the London publishers

The Outbound Road, by Arnold Mulder (302 pages; 
Houghton Mifflin), is a finely conceived novel, de- 
veloped with a rare disregard of conventional modes 
of setting forth a story, and yet it stops short of 
achievement. The materials are there, together with 
a basic idea to give it form, but a pervading stiffness, 
a style that is fragmentary and inarticulate, interposes. 
If the author can conquer his medium, he will be on 
the road to recognition. 

The Ground-Swell, by Mary Hallock Foote (283 pages; 
Houghton Mifflin), holds the interest because of the 
refreshing quality of the author's human sympathies. 
The story, told by a retired army officer's wife, is of 
a quest for some Eden in which they may spend their 
declining years. Their plans for earthly paradise are 
interrupted by the careers of their daughters and by 
a most charming Adam. 

The Great Desire, by Alexander Black (3% pages; Har- 
per), tells the old story of a young man's quest. The 
spirited humor and deft characterization give the tale 
a freshness which makes it first-rate light reading. 

A Damsel in Distress, by Pelham Grenville Wodehouse 
(302 pages; Doran), is a highly amusing farce with 
effective entrances, rapid dialogue, and well inflated 
jokes; but the setting, despite English titles and 
castles, is really the Broadway stage. 

Believe You Me! by Nina Wilcox Putnam (300 pages; 
Doran), contains some amusing foolery, slangy and 
pert, but the current of action is not brisk enough, 
nor the undercurrent of authentic characterization 
deep enough, to float the reader's interest to the end. 
It needs to be read in snatches. 

The Invader's Son, by William Antony Kennedy (387 
pages; Sully), indulges in cheerful prophecy, both 
racial and international. Its theme is that out of the 
lusts of war will come the seeds of a true international- 
ism, and to sustain the thesis, ' the novelist trudges 
calmly into absurdity. 

The Box With the Broken Seals, by E. Phillips Oppen- 
heim (300 pages; Little, Brown, Boston), puts its 
author one notch nearer fifty in "novel" making, and 
testifies to an adroit technique not permitted to gather 
rust. The present tale, woven of war mystery and 
international intrigue, unfolds with pace and assur- 



The Great House, by Stanley J. Weyman (398 pages; 
Longmans, Green), presents a superficial picture of 
English life in the middle forties. The usual estate 
in dispute, and the usual documents that disappear and 
are discovered, keep the story in momentum. 

The Green Pea Pirates, by Peter B. Kyne (308 pages; 
Doubleday, Page), fosters the threadbare but harm- 
less illusion that all sea-going men are natural con- 
versationalists and humorists, looking upon life as a 
philosophic lark. In this instance, the sparkle is un- 
evenly maintained. 

Blue China, by B. M. Croker (286 pages; Brentano), is 
the story of what happened to an English collector of 
porcelains, its plot embellished with meager inven- 
tion, and its style embellished by such disregard of 
literary entente as: "She had excellent taste, and ex- 
ercised it con amore; within a week the complete out- 
fit was well en train." 



Station X, by G. McLeod Winsor (317 pages; Lippincott, 
Philadelphia), snatches the burning brand of the 
planetary plot from Wells and extinguishes it. The 
author throws a dull wrench into his own elaborate 
machinery; the reader retains no more than an aca- 
demic interest in the literary sabotage. 

Short Stories from the Balkans, translated by Edna 
Worthley Underwood (246 pages; Marshall Jones, 
Boston), are timely, affording significant glimpses of 
contemporary Czech, Rumanian, Serbian, Croatian, and 
Hungarian literature. Some of the tales have con- 
siderable color and intensity; the translator has ac- 
complished her task creditably. 

Life Can Never Be the Same, by W. B. Maxwell (309 
pages; Bobbs-Merrill), is a collection of sketches and 
short stories, chiefly in the manner of episodic trans- 
criptions of life away from the war front. They are 
well conceived, and effective within their range. Mr. 
Maxwell establishes a tone; plot is merely casual in 
these pieces. 

The Happy Years, by Inez Haynes Irwin (310 pages; 
Holt), in which the Phoebe and Ernest of Mrs. Irwin's 
earlier stories have reached the middle thirties, deal 
with children, a "camp," Christmas, the marsh district, 
more children, and two wise grandparents. The plots 
respond a little too miraculously to the pressed button, 
but the results are always enjoyable. 

Waifs and Strays, by "O. Henry" (305 pages; Double- 
day, Page), snares for the library shelf a dozen fugi- 
tive etudes by the kte Sydney Porter, and fills the 
latter half of the volume with comment by various 
hands and an 0. Henry Index. A book for fans only. 

The Red Mark, by John Russell (397 pages; Knopf), is 
a group of horror tales of the Orient, of a French 
penal colony, of islands unknown even to globe-trotters, 
handled skillfully and with admirable restraint. 

The Honourable Gentleman And Others, by Achmed 
Abdullah (262 pages; Putnam), a series of tales of 
New York's Chinese quarter, are told in a stilted 
style that overloads the adjective with all the burden 
of conveying atmosphere. The author lacks entirely 
the deft touch and keen insight of the Burke of 
Limehouse Nights. 

Potash and Perlmutter Settle Things, by Montague 
Glass (259 pages; Harper), is one of the few books 
about the Peace Conference which regards the Con- 
ference as a peg, and not as a chip. Although "the 
king business ain't the garment business," there is 
sound wit in the reactions of these comic figures. 

Body and Raiment, by Eunice Tietjens (83 pages; 
Knopf), is reviewed on page 451. 

Second Poems, by Edwin Curran (26 pages; published 
by the author, Zanesville, Ohio). Mr. Curran's First 
Poems, issued last year, were reviewed by Louis Unter- 
meyer in THE DIAL for February 14, 1918. Early out 
of print, they have just been republished (55 pages; 
Four Seas Co., Boston). In the midst of much that is 
crude, halt, and banal they contain many passages of 
robust originality and striking imagery. The vigor 
and magic are so much more infrequent in Second 
Poems, and so briefly sustained, as to ^suggest that 
these may be "seconds" indeed, not later pieces. In 
either case they reveal no gain in craftsmanship. They 
are worth reading once for the thrill of an occasional 
flashing figure and the delight of sudden, unpremeditat-

This book is based upon the results of housing investigations in more than two score cities and the experience in teaching classes

THE MONROE DOCTRINE AND THE GREAT WAR By A. B. HALL, Ph.D.

There is a close connection between the Great War and the Monroe Docrine. Our isolation from European difficulties is no longer

diplomatic history for a century. In the minds of many a league of nations means the giving up of this historic policy, but Professor 
Hall shows that it is essentially akin to the policy laid down in the covenant. Price $0.75.

ed music. Meanwhile the First Poems will reward fre- 
quent rereading, both for their intrinsic merit and 
for their rich promise, which a volume of Third Poems 
may at any time fulfill. 

Hearts Awake, by Amelia Josephine Burr (155 pages, 
Doran), is as complacent, wholesome, and monotonous 
as Miss Burr's verse usually is. A few lyric passages 
in the rhymed play The Pixy are enticing, but the 
war poems are in bulk banal and sentimental; and 
the love songs, chiefly of repression and renunciation, 
have scant grace and no fire. 

The Harvest Home, by James B. Kenyon (409 pages; 
James T. White & Co., New York), is a garrulous Rip 
Van Winkle astray from an earlier generation. The 
sins of a too-facile pen, imitation, and thin-spun emo- 
tion overbalance a certain grace and delicacy in these 
nature, amatory, and religious verses. 

Merchants of the Morning, by Samuel McCoy (74 
pages; Doran), belongs to the "lambent" lodge of 
the "fain" degree of the "didst do" fraternity in verse. 
Its most readable lines are twice removed from poetry 
once by Alfred Noyes, and again from Alfred 
Noyes. 

Turmoil: Verses Written in France, 1917-1919, by Robert 
A. Donaldson (75 pages; Houghton Mifflin), contains 
some interesting war pictures, but little poetry. A 
curiously inevitable prose dogs all but the imagist 
verses, which are the best of the collection. 

A Book of Princeton Verse II: 1919 (179 pages; 
Princeton University Press), is reviewed on page 450. 

The Second Pagan Anthology: Containing Poems that 
Have Appeared in The Pagan Magazine (88 pages; 
Pagan Publishing Co., New York), really contains a 
series of insults to the first. George O'Neil, whose 
poem Rendezvous is ene of the few exceptions, is 
twice unfortunate in his inclusion here, and in his 
being too late for inclusion in an anthology dis- 
tinguished by the work of Maxwell Bodenheim and 
Orrick Johns. Pagans, if they can invoke the Muse 
no more confidently than other folk, should at least be 
able to detect her most meretricious pretenders. 

Tete-D'Or, by Paul Claudel, translated from the French 
by John Strong Newberry (178 pages; Yale University 
Press), is now added to the uniform edition of the 
poet. Lewis Galantiere's The Poetic Drama of Paul 
Claudel, in THE DIAL for June 20, 1918, commented 
on Tete-D'Or, which will be reviewed later. 

The Social Plays of Arthur Wing Pinero, edited 
with a general introduction and a critical preface to 
each play by Clayton Hamilton, Vol. Ill: Letty; His 
House in Order (449 pages; Dutton), brings this 
Authorized Library Edition down to Mid-Channel and 
The Thunderbolt, which will fill the final volume. 
Since few writings fall into obscurity so quickly as 
plays that have left the boards, it is well to have this 
definitive edition of a playwright whose contribution, 
if overestimated yesterday, is today in danger of being 
underestimated. One must regret however that Sir 
Arthur is less fortunate in his editor than he has been 
in his players. 

Dr. Jonathan: A Play in Three Acts, by Winston Church- 
ill (159 pages; Macmillan), is reviewed on page 450. 

The Silver Age and Other Dramatic Memories, by Tem- 
ple Scott (216 pages; Scott & Seltzer), is reviewed on 
page 451. 



The Philosophy of Conflict, And Other Essays in War- 
time, by Havelock Ellis (299 pages; Houghton Mifflin), 
is the work of one of the finest, keenest, clearest, and 
most humane minds in Europe. The major part of the 
book deals with tn"e war with its place in history, 
with its relation to other human institutions, with its 
effect upon European civilization. The last section con- 
tains a discussion of various aspects of the sex problem, 
ranging from Eugenics in Relation to the War to the 
Politics of Women a field where Mr. Ellis speaks 
with authority. The interspersed essays en Herbert 
Spencer, Elie Faure, Rodo, and others are a distin- 
guished contribution to humanist criticism. 

The Anatomy of Society, by Gilbert Cannan (216 
pages; Dutton), continues the social criticism which 
the author initiated in his little work Freedom. This 
is the sort of coherent essay, somewhat more general- 
ized in content, that the late Randolph Bourne devel- 
oped so successfully for us in America. 

Walled Towns, by Ralph Adams Cram (105 pages; 
Marshall Jones, Boston), is an attempt to "find some 
hints of the saving alternative" to the deadly impasse 
in Western civilization which Mr. Cram discovered in 
his previous books The Nemesis of Mediocrity, The 
Great Thousand Years, and The Sins of the Fathers- 
all of which were reviewed in THE DIAL for September 
2U. in spite of the author's disclaimer, Walled Towns 
is a sketch of that little Utopia in the back of his mind 
which he would fain put in the foreground of society. 

The Free City, by Bouck White (314 pages; Moffat 
Yard) , is a pre-sociological, exhortatory essay on muni- 
cipalism. Mr. White's method of exciting us to leave 
our admittedly conglomerate and over-centralized civili- 
zation is to take the mottled past of Greek, Roman, 
and Medieval cities and to picture the sunlight of 
these eras without their definitive shadows. The 
author concentrates all the virtues and beatitudes into 
the idea of municipality, without perceiving that, his- 
torically, a good part of the vices, crimes, and de- 
. pressions also adhere to it. The New Jerusalem is not 
a remedy, for all of Mr. White's enthusiasm: it is the 
state of health which would follow the abatement of 
that disease for whose remedy we still grope. 

Were You Ever a Child? by Floyd Dell (202 pages; 
ISJiopI), introduces a series of comments and dialogues 
on education which first appeared in the Liberator 
tfook-magic, caste, and regimentation are the butts of 
Mr. Dells attack: play and art and freedom and the 
untrammeled exercise of idle curiosity are the goods 
which he seeks to establish. The author's studied 
audacity and his pleasing conversational prose should 
be sufficiently stimulating to awaken reflection in the 
minds of those who have never been forced by ex- 
perience to examine the debris of what has been called 
an education. 

Ibsen in England, by Miriam Alice Franc (195 pages; 
Four Seas, Boston), brings back a period which is 
best recalled by the now stale audacities of The 
Philanderer. Miss Franc makes it plain that Ibsen 
was well-nigh as great a victim of his translators one 
of whom interpreted him in terms of Karma as of 
his detractors. The author's criticism is secondary to 
her documentation. 

Literature With a Large L,by Macgregor Jenkins (110 
pages; Houghton Mifflin), is a net dipped into 
shallow pools: the writer catches only the minnows 
of thought. Mr. Jenkins rises to defend the aimless 
reader, and the aimless reader doubtless will agree 
with everything he says.

The Perfect Gentleman, by Ralph Bergengren (134 
pages; Atlantic Monthly Press, Boston), turns a hu- 
morous plow into familiar furrows, shedding ephemeral 
freshness on such eternal themes as lying in bed, shav- 
ing, dressing, and visiting the barber. In the fashion- 
ing of essays, Mr. Bergengren strives for the droll 
rather than the durable. 

The American Front, by Captain Ernest Peixotto (230 
pages; Scribner), is the first-hand war narrative of an 
officer whose business it was to record for the War De- 
partment the visual aspects of the American operations 
in France. The pictures, like the text, have an air of 
quiet and studious detachment. 

Old New England Doorways, by Albert G. Robinson 
(21 pages; 67 plates; Scribner), prefaces an exquisite 
set of photographs, taken all through New England, 
with an interesting note upon the character, genesis, 
and distribution of these typical examples of a more 
or less indigenous colonial art. 

American Painting and Its Tradition, by John C. Van 
Dyke (270 pages; Scribner), makes one realize the 
weakness of an American heritage which can include 
the banalities of Alexander and leave out the poignant 
romanticism of Albert Pinkham Ryder. The book is 
amply illustrated, and in some of the older works the 
black-and-white of the reproduction is superior to the 
mud-and-moss of the original. 

A Labrador Doctor, by Wilfred Thomason Grenfell (441 
pages; Houghton Mifflin), permits a figure of wide and 
admirable notoriety to tell the story of his life from 
the first youthful roamings across the sands of Dee to 
his adventurous ministrations, as medical missionary, 
along the bleaker coast of Labrador. 

Canon Barnett: His Life, Work, and Friends, by His 
Wife (2 Vols., 717 pages; Houghton Mifflin), furnishes 
interesting, albeit unevenly illuminating, sidelights up- 
on the founder of the settlement movement, the first 
warden of Toynbee Hall. 

Four Americans: Roosevelt, Hawthorne, Emerson, Whit- 
man, by Henry A. Beers (90 pages; Yale University 
Press), does scant justice to every member of the 
galaxy except the late ex-president. Mr. Beers' lack 
of political sympathy with Roosevelt increases the 
competence of his estimate of the man; and in an 
atmosphere made hideous by the raucous tribal ecsta- 
sies of memorial committees it strikes a welcome, 
temperate note. The Wordlet about Whitman might 
well have gone unwhispered. 

Lenin: The Man and His Work, by Albert Rhys Williams 
(202 pages; Scott & Seltzer, New York), is announced 
as "the first authentic biography" of the man who has 
the distinction of being the most widely cursed and 
blessed person now alive. The chapters by Mr. Wil- 
liams are supplemented by impressions set down by 
Raymond Robins and Arthur Ransome. 

The Russian Pendulum, by Arthur Bullard (256 pages; 
Macmillan), is the "report" of Mr. Creel's chief rep- 
resentative in Russia and Siberia. Needless to say, 
extremist styles in revolution are offensive to the 
author's taste. 

The Bullitt Mission to Russia, (151 pages; Huebsch), 
reprints Mr. Bullitt's testimony before the Senate For- 
eign Relations Committee the "tissue of lies" for 
which Lloyd-George's new flirtations with the Bolshe- 



viki threaten to substitute a less substantial gossamer 
of truth. 

The Political Future of India, by Lajpat Rai (237 
pages; Huebsch), was written when self-determina- 
tion was a word to conjure with. As a means of re- 
moving the white man's burden from tb.e brown man's 
shoulders, the author suggests nothing more radical 
than Home Rule for India. 

Law and the Family, by Robert Grant (264 pages; 
Scribner), treats of domestic relations, and marriage 
and divorce, and feminism, and women and property 
with the air of genial sympathy and resolute enlight- 
ment that one might expect from a Probate Judge in a 
court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

The Rival Philosophies of Jesus and Paul, by Ignatius 
Singer (347 pages; Open Court Publishing Co., Chi- 
cago), finds as the result of an untheological examina- 
tion of the New Testament that when specious in- 
terpretations are set aside the Christ of the Gospels 
becomes a natural philosopher, leading a revolution 
which "was never anything but temporal and social," 
while Paul proves to be a dialectical humbug whose 
otherworldliness, glorification of mastership, and dis- 
claimer of immediate responsibilities effected a per- 
version of Christianity.

A FORTNIGHTLY 



The Labor Movement in Barcelona 



I 



T is SPECIALLY IMPORTANT, in trying to under- 
stand the labor movement in Barcelona, to bear 
in mind the historical antecedents of Catalan syn- 
dicalism. From the time of the split in the First 
International (1872), and even before that took 
place, from the first efforts of Bakunin to organize 
his followers, there was one group of Spanish agi- 
tators that adhered to Bakunin's doctrines, the 
leaders of the labor movement in Catalunya. It 
was this group which sent delegates to the so-called 
Anti-authoritarian Congress called by the Bakunin- 
ist faction, at Saint Imier. The division in the 
outlook of the Spanish proletariat, made apparent 
at that Congress, has been a permanent one. Mad- 
rid has been the central nursery of the Socialist 
movement, while Barcelona has been the hotbed 
of anarchism. Lafargue, the son-in-law of Marx, 
was the principal inspirer of the Socialist agita- 
tion, and often visited Madrid for propaganda 
purposes. The anarchists relied upon Fanelli, a 
friend of Bakunin, who went frequently to Bar- 
celona, with the object of keeping up the enthu- 
siasm, already virulent in its own right, of the 
initiates of that region. 

The writer who took over the intellectual legacy 
of Bakunin was Kropotkin. The writings of Kro- 
potkin, in translations that still enjoy an extraor- 
dinary popularity in Catalunya, attained a veritable 
ascendency over the better educated laboring classes 
in the Catalan capital. From the ranks meanwhile 
was rising a native author, a man of the most 
correct and austere character, who, up to the time 
of his death during the recent war, was the mouth- 
piece of anarchistic and communistic doctrine. 
This man was Anselmo Lorenzo. His most char- 
acteristic work is The Militant Proletariat, El 
proletariadp militante. 

The year 1898 marked our great disaster in the 
war with* the United States. That episode gave 
the Spanish anarchical movement its greatest in- 
fluence and prestige. It led in 1902 and 1903 
to the first really general strike of revolutionary 
character ever organized in Catalunya. The tie-up 
was absolute in every department of life. Bar- 
celona is the busiest place, normally, in the west- 



ern Mediterranean. During that strike the only 
things that moved were the bullets whistling in ex- 
change between populace and soldiery. 

The anarchistic movement now equipped itself 
with a daily newspaper, Land and Freedom (Tierra 
y Libertad), and a monthly, The White Magazine 
(La revista blanca) . But, as a matter of fact, the 
anarchistic enthusiasm of Catalan labor seemed to 
have spent itself in the great strike of 1902-3. The 
groups began to dwindle away, and large masses 
of workers flocked toward a new political party 
which started in Barcelona under an ultra-revolu- 
tionary banner. It was called the Radical Repub- 
lican Party, and Mr. Alexander Lerroux was its 
leader. 

Hope in such political action failed to be real- 
ized. Disappointment, rather, throughout the 
laboring classes, was intensified. So that in 1910, 
all this revolutionary enthusiasm, which in going 
over to Mr. Lerroux's party, had given such an 
emphatically radical color to the Radical Repub- 
licans, sought a new vehicle of expression. The 
Catalan labor movement turned inward upon itself, 
and began a propaganda toward syndicalism. 

The group that proclaimed the glad tidings of 
syndicalism was still the old anarchical nucleus, 
with Anselmo Lorenzo in the foreground. He 
translated from French and propounded the syn- 
dicalistic doctrine of a French militant, Pouget, 
likewise of anarchistic intellectual ancestry. French 
syndicalism started proletarian ideology through- 
out the world in a new direction, toward the re- 
vision of tactic namely, and toward a new evalua- 
tion of political contact on the part of the masses. 
An attack was started on Socialism as an efficient 
method and as an ideal, contrasting with its dicta 
the two principles of direct action and syndicalistic 
organization by trades. A characteristic trait of 
this French movement was mistrust and even con- 
tempt for everyone not a manual laborer and es- 
pecially for those devoted to intellectual activities. 

But this movement in France suffered such a 
crisis during the war that it now comes out with 
an entirely different physiognomy, which it is nec- 
essary to describe, because of its great influence on

developments in Barcelona. As regards internal 
policy, the Confederation General du Travail 
worked out a reform program which it presented 
to the government on the eve of the armistice, and 
which was approved at the Lyons Congress of 
September. Internationally, the French Federation 
led the way in stressing the importance of the 
international labor conference at Washington. In 
other words, the -French organization has com- 
pletely rectified a tactic which favored direct 
action, and now admits juridic tactics at least in 
an auxiliary role. Accepting the principle of re- 
lentless class struggle, it nevertheless recognizes 
the utility of treaties of peace on concrete questions. 
For all that pertains to political action, the Federa- 
tion, as is now known to all who follow its actions 
closely, has expressed its willingness to work out 
a program in common with the Socialists, foresee- 
ing the chance that the vicissitudes of French pol- 
itics may soon bring it into power. 

Now the Catalan workers followed French lead 
in organizing their General Federation, La Con- 
federacion del Trabajo, and kept intimate contact 
with France in the years just preceding the war. 
They broke with the French, however, in keeping 
themselves away from the International Syndicalist 
Congress at Amsterdam, in July 1919, a confer- 
. ence instigated precisely by the French Federation. 

The present leaders of Catalan syndicalism are 
Angel Pestanya, Segui Miranda, and the Roca 
brothers. The movement has been gradually dis- 
tinguishing itself from anarchism. Tierra y Lib- 
erdad has ceased to express the aspirations of the 
largest working classes, who now speak through 
Solidaridad Obrera, a paper edited by Pestanya. 
The organizations are now permanent, and dues 
are even exacted, but still without obligation of 
accounting to the syndicates. Thus the Catalan 
movement has come to dispose of a powerful army 
which picks up its tents, and camps today in one 
place and tomorrow in some other." Nomadism is 
its characteristic trait, a tactic also, specially adapt- 
ed to an organization with a marked preference for 
secret action. In such action, indeed, lies much 
of the power, undeniably great, which Catalan syn- 
dicalism exercises. The organizations rely, for 
their cohesion, less on the possession of a resi- 
dence and an address, than on the suggestiveness 
of an ideal and on secret discipline. It is a tactic 
peculiarly calculated to appeal to the romantic 
propensities of the Catalan workers. 

How does it work in practice? When a strike 
is to be called, an agent suddenly appears in an 
establishment, with an "order" accrediting him 
as a representative of the "supreme syndicalist 



committee." He communicates his orders to the 
workers. This method, in truth, was partly bor- 
rowed from German Spartacides. In part it was 
worked out and perfected in Catalunya itself. It 
gives the labor army an extraordinary mobility 
and facility for "surprise attacks." On the other 
hand it demands a discipline and a spirit of obedi- 
ence that probably exists nowhere in the labor 
world unless in Germany and Catalunya. The 
Catalan worker sets much store on discipline, and 
his obedient response to orders is a source of 
strength as well .as weakness. The present year 
has seen strikes in which the workers have demon- 
strated unconquerable solidarity, netting speedy 
and often unexpectable gains. Nevertheless, such 
strikes have sometimes given rise to new conflicts 
which ended by throwing labor back behind the 
lines it had gained in earlier battles. 

This situation is due to the presence of non- 
syndicalists inside the very organizations, who fail 
to realize that every tactic must be based on 
methodical action, and that all experimental meth- 
ods must 'take account of real, empirical facts, 
which are not susceptible of bending to the tyranny 
of a priori logic. One cannot say direct action 
and nothing but direct action. At certain moments 
it will be necessary to act indirectly in defense of 
the interests committed to direct action itself; it 
will be necessary to treat with the powers that be, 
and with the possessing class. Catalan syndicalism 
is beginning to realize this, and on this point its 
internal crisis is developing. 

A movement is growing inside the Catalan move- 
ment in the direction of socialistic methods which 
do, not overlook the necessity of maintaining revo- 
lutionary emotion as a motive force in social his- 
tory, but still consider it essential to make use 
day by day of all available energies to obtain by 
legal means an improvement in the standard of 
living. Last October Pestanya and Segui, in 
speeches delivered at Madrid in the Comedy Theater 
and the People's House, admitted that at times it 
would be better to come to terms with the historic 
enemy, capital and government allied. So strong, 
in spite of all distances, is the influence exerted 
on them by the dominant trend at the Lyons Con- 
ference, that Segui went so far as to say so Jou- 
haux and his colleagues assert, at least that the 
Russian Revolution will collapse for lack of prep- 
aration, going on to suggest the absolute neces- 
sity of including men of science in the perspective 
of tha labor movement. 

At present the organizations seem disposed to 
consider participation in the "mixed commissions" 
(labor and capital) that are being organized to

diminish industrial conflicts. If this be so, the 
labor movement of Barcelona is about to enter 
a new epoch in its history, the significance of which 
will depend upon the policies of the capitalist 
class of Catalunya, a class on the whole so in- 
credibly avaricious and intolerant that, not content 
with profiteering on the war to an enormous figure, 
it is now a unit against income tax reform in 
Spain and against tariff revision. 

A few days ago, this same group of owners in 
Catalunya proclaimed a lockout and appealed for 
support to their kindred in the rest of Spain. The 
object was to provoke a fight to the finish with 
the labor organizations in their region, destroy 

An Evangelist 

J. HE NINETEENTH CENTURY was not kind to its 
youths. It was out of a tepid adolescence that 
its Ruskins and Spencers and Mills grew into intel- 
lectual manhood. The most notable biographies 
of the period have the stale prophylactic air of 
an old-fashioned sick-room. That of Samuel Au- 
gustus Barnett, as related by his wife, is no excep- 
tion. (Canon Barnett: His Life, Work, and 
Friends; 2 vols., Houghton Mifflin.) 

Barnett was born into that mid-century Eng- 
land whose green surface was blighted by the 
smuts of 'the new coal-industrialism. His father 
was the manufacturer of a procrustean species of 
iron bed, and he escaped the paternal foundry, 
"despite very definite inclinations toward business," 
chiefly by reason of a failure in health which 
pointed to a career under Holy Orders via Oxford. 
It is one thing to leave the Black Country and 
another to find Jerusalem. Through the valetudin- 
arian idleness of his adolescence, Samuel did not 
browse, like Disraeli, in the sear pastures of an an- 
cestral library. His leisure was wasted in the com- 
pany of tutors and crammers and uninspiring dons, 
and by the time he left Oxford there was little to 
distinguish him in mentality from the hero of The 
Way of All Flesh. Throughout his pregnant later 
developments Barnett wore his early clerical and 
academic limitations as St. Francis might have 
worn a Mosaic vestment. While belying the inner 
man and hampering his work, they remained as 
close to him as his skin, and as if to conceal the 
armory of fine initiatives and aptitudes which 
Barnett seems to have inherited from his grand- 
father, Nature conspired with his tailor to set a 
prematurely old-looking head on top of an awk- 
ward and frequently shabby outfit of clothes. 
Every man kills the thing he loves, exclaims a 



them, and reduce wages all along the line. It is 
to our national credit that liberal opinion as well 
as the government declared against this move and 
broke it up. But no incident could have illus- 
trated better the lack of insight in this group of 
sorry money-makers, in choosing the very moment 
when the syndicalists were on the point of coming 
over to legal tactics for announcing an attitude 
calculated perfectly to provoke rage and exaspera- 
tion. All that can be said of it is that just when 
the Spartacides were inclining toward Reformism, 
the owners decided to adopt the Spartacist con- 
stitution for themselves. 

FERNANDO DB LOS Rios. 

of Civilization 

certain poet of late Victorianism, and Barnett came 
near to killing Christianity by his blind caricature 
of its professional exponents. 

After a few years of public school teaching and 
American travel Barnett settled down in London 
(1867). There he fell under the influence of two 
women. The first was that violent virgin, Octavia 
Hill. At that time Miss Hill was rising from the 
humanely efficient plane of slum rent-collection to 
the dizzier levels of charity organization, and in the 
course of propagating the new agent of salvation 
she introduced the earnest son of the iron-founder 
to the slag of his father's civilization, and initiated 
him into the mechanism of poor relief which 
sought to salvage or transport or decently cover 
up the debris. Serving on one of Octavia's com- 
mittees, Barnett met Henrietta Octavia Rowland. 
He got from her an edifying sense of his own 
incompleteness, and a long and exasperatingly 
evangelical courtship followed. In the end, the 
spirited girl who came into Barnett's life to scoff 
remained to pray. They married, and despite the 
offer of an Oxford living the couple settled down 
in the rectory of St. Jude in Whitechapel. 

This marriage did more than bind a man and 
woman together: it created an institution. In the 
give and take of connubiality two things seem to 
have happened: Mrs. Barnett increasingly adopted 
her husband's tone and word and gesture, with the 
result that the mischievous girl of nineteen de- 
velopes in the course of reminiscence into an old 
woman whose sobriety frequently approaches the 
sanctimonious. On the other hand, Barnett en- 
riched his uncertain social impulses with Octavia 
IPs urgency and vitality and derring-do. As the 
fruit of that union they jointly battered down the 
walls of private benevolence and ministration and

the new institution called Toynbee Hall, a uni- 
versity settlement (1884). All the little rivulets 
of impulse ran into this main stream of the Bar- 
netts' life. At its origin the idea was a profoundly 
significant one, and it is unfortunate that in the 
course of its application its essence should have 
evaporated. Its meaning for the present genera- 
tion is worth the pains of recapture and transla- 
tion into modern phrase. 

The mission of the Church, Barnett reasoned, 
had proved ineffectual in both the East and West 
Ends of London because it was incomplete. The 
Church had contented itself with merely sowing 
the mummy-seeds of verbal Christianity. What we 
needed in this new barbarism of England was an 
institution which should take account of the or- 
ganic wholeness of society and seek not merely to 
inculcate Christianity but to spread civilization. 
Foolish laymen wished to give the poor bread, as 
though poverty were simply a leanness of the flesh, 
while within the Church "blind mouths" who 
"climbed into the fold for their bellies' sake" had 
made the blither of orthodoxy a substitute for the 
glories of art and science in which what is godlike 
in man becomes manifest. Poverty however was 
at bottom more than a failure in the supply of 
food or the demand for labor: it was a failure of 
civilization as a whole. Hence you had to restore 
civilization to Whitechapel before you attempted to 
recover Christianity for Westminster Abbey, and 
all your efforts to improve housing, regulate the 
labor supply, abolish drunkenness, or dole relief 
were significant only to the extent that they repre- 
sented a many-sided and consistent advance of 
civilization. 

The attitude that I hare roughly attempted to 
restate explains Barnett's divergence from the nar- 
rowly "philanthropic" interests of his Hill-sided 
curacy. When the poor asked for bread the 
C. 0. S. gave them the stone of "relief to the 
deserving." The Warden of Toynbee Hall refused 
to insult his neighbors in that fashion. When 
they asked him for bread he sent them forth look- 
ing for the Kingdom of Heaven in clubs and schools 
and art exhibitions, in the assurance that in the 
fullness of time everything else would be added 
thereto. Barnett, it is true, was not a labor 
leader, and as he was a confirmed socialist in 
Westminster he tended to relapse into Morleyan 
radicalism in Mile End Road. But his mission 
was to create that divine discontent upon which 
men like Burns and Tillett could work, and the 
worst thing that an inimical church organ could say 



of Barnett was that according to him "a man's 
duty to his neighbor is to be discontented with 
his lot in life, to covet and desire other men's 
goods, and to go on strike if his wages or the con- 
ditions of his employment did not suit him." 

It is hardly fair to label Canon Barnett a Chris- 
tian Socialist, but there is plenty of evidence in 
his biography to show that he participated in the 
specific virtues of both creeds. On this subject 
it is necessary to scrape off the thick crust of im- 
plication. "Christian" carries with it the presump- 
tion of orthodox sectarianism, and Socialist the 
definite stigma of dogmatic economics; whereas it 
was Barnett's glowing ability to think steadily about 
civilization as a whole, and only as occasion re- 
quired about the mechanism for bringing a new 
order of society into existence. In relation to the 
dignitaries of his Church Barnett's attitude was 
one of humble animosity. He felt at first the 
insignificance of his own position in the Anglican 
hierarchy, and he felt even more keenly, one senses, 
the abysmal inferiority of such pastoral lords as 
had learned "the way to promotion and pay." Per- 
sonally devout, he never worried his associates with 
religiosity. He boldly opened his Whitechapel 
Art Exhibitions on Sunday, to the horror of the 
Lord's Day Observance Society (an institution), 
and he even made his own Bishop depart far 
enough from strict Sabbatarianism to swallow the 
innovation with a blessing. 

A man with such a vivid feeling as Barnett pos- 
sessed for new forms of expression naturally awak- 
ened the antagonism of those who clung with mor- 
bid tenacity to the old. A glut of theological con- 
troversy sought to head off Barnett's every inno- 
vation. A rival settlement house was started to 
counteract the undenominational liberalism of 
Toynbee Hall. This counter attack was pertinently 
representative. To the orthodox Barnett was irre- 
ligious; to the comfortable he was "socialistic"; 
to the philanthropic he was a restless demagogue. 
No man with such a genial gift for making ene- 
mies can have his character laughed out of court 
on account of the black suit and white cravat he 
may happen to wear. Barnett's convictions were 
never cut to his cloth. 

Barnett's socialism had two aspects. On its con- 
structive side it was an attempt to open up the 
resources of civility to every member of the com- 
munity. In the language of the social economist . 
he sought to make the workers translate their de- 
mand for more nominal wages in money to more 
real wages in life. When asked for a message to 
the great body of industrial workers he replied:

1892. At this juncture I would press home to them 
the need of knowledge as the means of widening their 
lives. The mistake that working men seem to me to be 
making is in thinking that their only want is money, 
and that is why we press so hard the University Exten- 
sion teaching. We say to a man, "If you will only read 
history you may get out of your single room and live 
in the Empire, and if you will make Shakespeare your 
own you will have the biggest possession, next the Bible, 
the English language ever can possess. It is nonsense 
thinking you must possess parks and lands; when you 
have them you will find your best pleasure to enjoy 
Shakespeare." . . . The tendency of nearly all edu- 
cation has been to restrain the imagination. I think it 
needs development. I do not want many alterations in 
law, but I should like the best things made free. We 
want more baths and wash-houses, especially swimming 
baths, and they should be free and open in every dis- 
trict. Books and pictures should be freely shown, so 
that every man may have a public library /or a picture gallery 
as his drawing room, where he can enjoy what is good 
with his boys and girls. We want more open spaces, so 
that every man, woman, and child might sit in the open 
air and see the sky and the sunset. . . . We want 
free provision of the best forms of pleasure. Denmark 
provides traveling scholarships, and our school authorities 
are taking steps in that direction. Germany does some- 
thing to give everyone the opportunity of seeing great 
plays, greatly acted. . . . The way is thus shown, and 
more must be done, and there must be patience while, 
through the operations of education and leisure, the poor 
learn to enjoy these things. Poverty cannot pay for the 
pleasure which satisfies, and yet, without that pleasure, 
the people perish. . . . Free air, free water, free litera- 
ture, cheap trains, would make a great change. 

Plainly Barnett was not merely the founder of 
the university settlement: with his wife he was 
at least partly responsible for that stirring inquiry 
into the defects and potentialities of city life which 
began with Booth's Survey of London and devel- 
oped by way of Letchworth, Hampstead, and nu- 
merous younger settlements into the contemporary 
impulse toward a large-scale civic renaissance 
which gives promise of a more comely civiliza- 
tion for tomorrow. With the founder of agricul- 
tural cooperation in Denmark, Barnett demon- 
strated that the roundabout route is often the surest 
and easiest path to one's goal. Both men were 
exponents of the theory of Indirect Action. It is 
no small compliment to the Englishman to say 
that he, among half a dozen others, is candidate 
for the title of the Gruntwig of the civic renais- 
sance. 

Barnett's influence on the formation of the Work- 
ers' Educational Association in 1903 was in the 
direct line of his civic activities. Experience had 
made him an incisive critic of the middle-class sys- 
tem of university extension service, for he saw that 
the mission of the reconstituted university was not 
to "lift" the more capable workers into the bour- 
geoisie but to prepare the whole body of workers 
to supplant the bourgeoisie. He believed "that, 



dormant under the dark surface of working class 
opinion, hidden, as are now the forces which by 
and by will make the fruit or weeds, are the forces 
to rule the future." Hence he held that "the 
Oxford which in the past inspired the governing 
classes of the nation must be so changed and 
adapted that it may inspire the minds of those 
who are now called to take up the government." 
Is it too much to say that Samuel Barnett was 
the Baptist who sought to purify and strengthen 
the force of this approaching revolution in thought 
and life? 

As Barnett's socialism was on its intellectual 
side a mission of construction., it was with re- 
spect to the underlying material conditions of 
change a gesture of protest. He conducted an 
unceasing polemic against the spiritual quiescence 
of the Christian Church in the face of the wide- 
spread debauch of nineteenth century industrialism. 
Men were starving in Whitechapel for bread, for 
light, for air, for cleanliness, for decent compan- 
ionship, for, the sight of field and forest, while 
the Church continued to minister with complacent 
imbecility to the leisured boredom of Berkeley 
Square. The Church's failure to understand the 
luxury of Mayfair in terms of the sweated degrada- 
tion of the East End; "society's'* assumption that 
the burden of responsibility could be canceled by 
equivalent pounds in the C. 0. S. subscription list; 
the State's belief that the discontent which cul- 
minated in strikes like those of the dockers could 
be alleviated by the obtuse audacities of the police- 
man and the soldier Barnett broke through these 
frozen ruts of thought and habit with a fierceness 
which was tempered only by the conventional, 
evangelical phrases into which he cast his indigna- 
tion. Barnett realized that the Westminster stand- 
ards of use and wont would have to be changed in 
preparation for a socialistic future as surely as 
the cultural standards of Oxford. Hence, whereas 
he sought to raise the second, he endeavored with 
equal conviction to level down the first. As early 
as 1883 he advocated Universal Pensions, to be 
accepted freely by every member of the community 
without prejudice to his social status. Here, as 
in various other instances, Barnett rose above the 
canons of his time, his class, and his vocation. 
Like Aristotle, he believed in a "society of equals, 
aiming at the best life possible." His work and 
temper and outlook are summed up in a single 
fact: the only future he could wish for his uni- 
versity settlement was that the need for it should 
disappear.

Leoncavallo 



I 



TALIAN MUSIC, like Italian food, makes a satis- 
factory meal when you are not hungry; if your ap- 
petite is honest you instinctively sniff after some- 
thing less filling and more nutritious. The operatic 
beef of Moussorgsky and Wagner has gradually 
picked off the trade of the Roman restaurants. 
Indeed, it is doubtful if even the most loyal sons of 
Milan do not occasionally feel that an Italian op- 
eratic aria is closely akin to a length of table d'hote 
spaghetti; sinuously attractive to the eye but subtly 
disappointing to the stomach at least to the Anglo- 
Franco-Germanic-American stomach. 

Still, the death of Ruggiero Leoncavallo, occur- 
ing on August 9 of this year, deserves an epitaph in 
this country, even though it be only an expression 
of joy that the man is safely buried. His influence 
on Italian opera, it is true, did not extend so far as 
Donizetti's, or so deep as Verdi's. Like his inferior 
corpsbruder, Pietro Mascagni, he was essentially a 
one-opera man: Pagliacci was the chariot on which 
he rode to success as certainly as Cavelleria Rusti- 
cana was the vehicle of the sentimental composer 
of the world-famous Intermezzo. In fact, in the 
face of nearly three-score opuses by Donizetti, a 
score by Verdi, a round dozen by Puccini, Leonca- 
vallo's labors, which include merely Pagliacci and 
five or six almost forgotten works, must flutter into 
oblivion. On the other hand, next to Puccini, he 
undoubtedly is today our most popular Italian com- 
poser, alive or dead. The gallery-storming trumpet- 
calls in Aida still recruit standees at the Metropoli- 
tan; but Rigoletto, Trovatore, La Traviata are fast 
wearing Verdi's prestige thin. Lucia Di Lammer- 
moor manages to hold back the waters of oblivion 
from Donizetti's name; but who knows, offhand, 
even the bare titles' of three of his remaining fifty- 
nine operatic varieties? Excluding Wagner, ask 
nny man in the street to mention the first opera he 
thinks of: his answer will as certainly -be Madame 
Butterfly or Pagliacci as it will not be Manon Les- 
caut or Falstaff. 

Such popularity points to at least one obvious 
merit. Leoncavallo knew his audience, and he 
wrote for it with his -tongue neither stuck in his 
cheek nor, like some composers, hanging out of his 
mouth. Whatever else Pagliacci may be, it is a 
straightforward cool-headed attempt to make the 
best of the custom of the country. The device of 
enacting a drama within a drama is not new. But 
it is new enough, even now, not to seem old. And 
on the operatic stage, where artistic conventions 
thaw about as rapidly as ice in January, such a 
variant HI the dramatization of the passion-worn 



triangle is particularly grateful to the eye. Nor 
is the ear less grateful, remembering always that 
it is in the land of milk and melody. If you have 
lately been dining on the elephant rump of Wagner 
in Germany, drinking the tiger's blood of Moussorg- 
sky in Russia, or eating madjoun with Debussy, 
you will gag at once on the turtle-dove stew of 
Leoncavallo. But if you come to Pagliacci with a 
clean palate, ready for anything in the pot, you 
will go away with a sweet one: at least it never 
will be actually cloyed. 

This is tossing Leoncavallo a laurel wreath with 
one hand and catching it with the other. The truth 
is, such treatment is about all the man deserves. 
Pagliacci has the merit of being a first-rate Italian 
Opera. But it has the ineradicable defect of being 
an Italian Opera. Dramatic in theme, clever in 
orchestration, varied in verbal and vocal tempo, it 
yet suffers internally from the disease which is en- 
demic through all modern Italy: adolescent emo- 
tionalism. In a subtle form, if there can be de- 
grees of murder, it exists in the poetic flights of 
D'Annunzio. In its more painfully obvious form 
it exists in II Trovatore, La Traviata, and that most 
pompously puerile of victrola-embalmed composi- 
tions, the Sextette from Lucia. 

It is from this disease that Italian Opera is bound 
to die sooner or later, if the disease does not kill 
the public's taste first. True, Leoncavallo was an 
admirer of Richard Wagner, if external imitation 
is the sincerest form of artistic admiration. That 
is, like Wagner, he wrote most of his own libretti. 
He even wrote libretti for other men. Moreover, 
he constructed, or contemplated constructing, a 
Ring of his own, based on the history of the Italian 
Renaissance. It was to do, apparently, for the 
Italian gods what Wagner's ponderous opus did 
for the mythological German ones. The names of 
his pretentious trio (if the work was completed it 
is at any rate upublished) were to have been I Med- 
ici, Savonarola, and Cesare Borgia. Italian, how- 
ever, all his work remained. He clung to tunes. 
He reveled in recitatives. He liked them, both 
separate and mixed. Also, like most of his clan, 
he evidently believed that tenors go to heaven when 
they die; and, in so far as it lay in his power, he 
decided to help them skyward. He was continually 
hitting above the Bass. He rarely strained his 
singers, for he knew more about jhe voice than 
Beethoven or even Wagner. But he was tempted, 
as all dramatists are, to give the leading lady and 
the leading man just one big C. His Operas do not 
tax the voice as does Fidelio, or Tristan und Isolde.

For the most part they are eminently vocal, as all 
Italian music is eminently vocal. These Italians 
have, indeed, a mysteriously facile manner of scal- 
ing the peaks without your realizing it. Whatever 
the reason, their prowess in the matter is undeni- 
able. But there it stops short. And because Art is as 
uncheatable as Nature the Italian Maestro, be he 
composer or performer, arrives at the top of his 
musical Mt. Blanc, not out of breath but out of 
inspiration. Short on dramatic wind he declaims; 
short on musical wind he vocalizes; short on inspi- 
ration he perspires. There never is a sustained at- 
tempt at wedding words and music ; only individual 
vowels and tones are important enough for a mar- 
riage ceremony; and if the story and the score are 
by any chance temporarily joined together in the 
holy bonds of art, it is a liaison to be winked at 
but not talked about. 

Vocally this may be magnificent; esthetically it 
is monstrous. In that nine-word distinction, -in 
sooth, you have the defects, hidden or revealed, of 
the entire troupe of Italian Operatic composers, 
singers, conductors, impresarios, and box-holders 
from the Seventeenth Century down to the Twen- 
tieth. Tone not interpretation, declamation not 
drama, the pretty-pretty and the bloody-bloody: 
these are the banners of the Roman army. By 
that army has been gallantly captured the tooth- 



some dainty of Puccini's La Boheme, the hollow 
cream-puff of Mascagni's Cavelleria Rusticana, the 
only slightly firmer and more pungent pastry of 
Pagliacci, by Leoncavallo himself. Table d'hote 
fare, in brief: celery, soup, and spaghetti; a dance^ 
a song, and a dagger ; and for dessert, the Alps seen 
through Italian opera-glasses as a range of mag- 
nificent, cream-topped charlottes-russe. 

On their credit side the Italians have contributed 
a great deal of entertainment, an extensive knowl- 
edge of the larynx, an acute understanding of the 
possibilities and limitations of the four-period 
song-form. Against these assets, however, stand lia- 
bilities which would bankrupt Rockefeller if he 
dealt in notes issued in opera houses and not in 
banks. With the death of Leoncavallo the respon- 
sibility for keeping the business going shifts some- 
what. The popularity of Pagliacci sooner or later 
is certain to wane. When that occurs will a younger 
man merely step into the dead composer's boots, 
and tramp beside Puccini? Or will some crafty 
rebel, remembering the pontificial glory that was 
Rome's (lately celebrated in this country, by the 
way, with a visit from the Papal Choir) get ahead 
of him first, and burn those boots? 

It is always a pity when a metaphor is too poetic 
to work. In this case it is nearer a tragedy.

A HE TITLE of The Moon and Sixpence (Doran) 
is an admission and a defense an 'admission by 
Somerset Maugham that explaining genius is as im- 
possible as expressing moonlight in terms of the de- 
cimal system, and a defense of his method against 
such critics as will assuredly accuse him of failing 
in a task he never attempted. He has no illusions 
about cutting his green cheese to a super-mundane 
thinness. He gives us, flatly and baldly, the exter- 
nal aspect of the evolution of genius, not bothered 
in the least by the fact that what happens in his 
narrative is neither explicable nor probable. He 
merely sees to it that it happens and that we are 
convinced. His task was to present an extraor- 
dinary phenomenon as it appeared to the ordinary 
folk of the social vicinity in which it occurred. It 
is his theory that this is what we can understand, 
and truly this .is what most concerns us. When 
a whirlwind sweeps the dozing harbor, we take 
no interest in the scientific explanations of the 
weather bureau, but pick our way down to the lit- 
tered beach to view the wreckage and gossip about 
the losses. It was a whirlwind of overmastering 
creative desire that caught up Charles Strickland, 



tore him from his wife, ruined the lives' of Stroeve 
and Blanche, and upset innumerable tidy schemes. 
Society saw nothing but a most deplorable confu- 
sion; Strickland was aware of nothing save an 
essential freedom. 

At the age of forty, Strickland was a heavy- 
featured monosyllabic stock-broker with an intel- 
lectual wife who went in for literary lions. Mrs. 
Strickland remembered vaguely that he had dab- 
bled a bit with paints when they were first mar- 
ried, but he had painted very badly and the family 
seemed to have laughed him out of it. The facts 
of his life were dull and usual. As a boy fresh 
from school he "went into a broker's office with- 
out any feeling of distaste. Until he married, he 
led the ordinary life of his fellows, gambling 
mildly on the Exchange, interested to the extent 
of a sovereign or two on the result of the Derby or 
the Oxford and Cambridge Race. I think he boxed 
a little in his spare time. On his chimney-piece he 
had photographs of Mrs. Langtry and Mary Ander- 
son. He read Punch and the Sporting Times. He 
went to dances in Hampstead." He was equally 
usual as a husband kindly, affable, undemonstra-

live, no doubt, but also thoroughly sane and re- 
spectable. Then unexpectedly he departed for 
Paris, leaving no vrord save a brief note to his 
wife, stating that he would never come back. His 
wife and her relatives assumed a woman in the 
case, In the words of Maugham, "whenever a 
man does anything unexpected, his fellows ascribe 
it to the most discreditable motives." But the 
friend who looks him up to reason with him finds 
no woman, but a bearded, shabby, sardonic Strick- 
land alone in one room of a dilapidated hotel 
learning to paint. 

Told in synopsis, the fable would seem too wildly 
unreasonable to be taken seriously. > It is Somer- 
set Maugham's achievement to have made it real 
by the accuracy of his circumstance and his finesse 
in the handling of ricocheted ideas. Nothing is 
presented to the reader first-hand. Rumors at the 
second and third and fourth remove crowd upon 
him, casual impressions sway him, until the fame 
of Strickland is built up in his mind out of accu- 
mulated fragments, as the fame of Shakespeare 
is forced upon those who have never read a play. 
The result is attained despite difficulties that an 
author less sure of his power would have avoided 
or skirted gingerly. There was no necessity for 
making Strickland so brutal, sensual, and tongue- 
tied as he is shown. 

I wondered what a stranger would have taken him to 
be, sitting there in his old Norfolk jacket and his un- 
brushed bowler; his trousers were baggy and his hands 
were not clean; and his face, with the red stubble of an 
unshaved chin, the little eyes, and the large, aggressive 
nose, was uncouth and coarse. His mouth was large, his 
lips were heary and sensual. 

One feels instinctively that genius does not take 
this guise, and that mastery is gained through un- 
derstanding rather than through demonic impulse. 
Maugham consciously discards the modern theories 
of genius, and returns to the romantic notion of 
revelation and the hidden flame. He denies the 
potency of the desire for fame, at least in this 
instance. Strickland cares nothing for his pictures 
once they are finished. His greatest work is de- 
stroyed by his own order. He prefers to live in 
an out-of-the-way corner. It is a question worth 
asking whether any man would have been quite 
content with the joy of fashioning beauty and with 
that alone. 

But whatever objection may be raised to the 
philosophy of art involved in the tale, Jthere is 
likely to be little but praise for its workmanship 
and its criticism of life. The author sees things 
squarely. If he errs at all, it is on the side of dis- 
belief. Mrs.- Strickland and Blanche Stroeve and 
Ata, the native girl, make up a trio from which 
we can derive a whole conception of womanhood. 



Perhaps it is old-fashioned. It is at least as much 
so as Shaw's artist man and mother woman. " 'In 
the end they get you,' says Strickland, 'and 
you are helpless in their hands. White or brown, 
they are all the same.' " 

When one closes the book and looks back over 
the varied scenes, civilized and barbaric, one has a 
memory of powerful and inevitable movement and 
the light and shadow of life itself. The English 
dinner table, the underworld of Marseilles, the vil- 
lage of Papeete are drawn in strong lines and bold 
colors that suggest the last paintings of Strickland 
on Tahiti. The book might have gained in epic 
quality had Mr. Maugham placed the island scenes 
first as he originally planned, but as it is, the 
dramatic effect is heightened. We begin with abso- 
lute disbelief in this "dull stockbroker." He 
seems a meager personality to follow through three 
hundred pages. The plot of the narrative is the 
revelation, one by one, of reasons why he is worth 
following. When we have put the novel by, we 
may disbelieve in him again if we will, for he is 
improbable enough, but it is none too easy to shake 
off the conviction that, for all the agnosticism we 
can muster, he did exist, all the way from West- 
minster to the leper's hut, concrete in flesh and 
blood. 

Somewhere it is reported that certain persons 
came upon Mr. Maugham in New York and charged 
him with "denuding human nature of its funda- 
mental goodness" in The Moon and Sixpence, and, 
further, that Mr. Maugham replied by saying that 
he took his model for Strickland from Gauguin. 
The charge is silly enough. Human nature is, at 
bottom, never any better than Strickland, and fre- 
quently far worse, from a moralist's point of view. 
But Strickland chose to demolish for himself the 
pretty temple of niceties and restraints which we 
are taught to build up from childhood over the 
black and fuming pit of the subconscious, and the 
revelation is naturally a shock to the self -worship- 
ing. It is well, no doubt, that few of us care 
to disrobe mentally, especially in public. But 
Maugham's defense was quite unsound. Gauguin, 
the burnt-out Parisian, is no parallel for Strick- 
land. Gauguin fled from a sickly civilization to a 
healthy barbarism. Strickland was neither burnt- 
out nor Parisian. He was English, a Philistine, 
and a barbarian in his own right. There is no 
explanation of his craving for Tahiti, as he is 
shown us in The Moon and Sixpence, save another 
form of the impulse that sent out the twelve 
apostles or drove the swine into the sea. He was 
inspired or mad or possessed of a devil as you 
please. And Gauguin was merely sated.

Japan and the Open Door 



.INTERNATIONAL FRICTIONS in the backward coun- 
tries of the world, in Africa, in Asia, in the Balkans, 
generate the sparks which set off modern wars. 
That is a lesson all of us have learned by now, but 
one merit of Frederic Coleman's latest book (The 
Far East Unveiled; Houghton Mifflin) is that it 
brings the lesson home afresh as regards the com- 
bustible material lying about in China. There is 
the case, for instance, of William F. Carey, vice 
president of the Siems-Carey Railway and Canal 
Company, a subsidiary of the American Interna- 
tional Corporation: Mr. Coleman tells how, in 
1916, Mr. Carey obtained concessions at Peking to 
dredge the Grand Canal, which traverses Shantung 
from North to South, and to build four railroad 
lines aggregating fifteen hundred miles in length. 
He tells of the excitement the contracts aroused 
among Peking diplomatists and concessionaires, of 
the ferment in Tokio and Paris and London and 
Petrograd (Russia had not yet been overturned), 
of the outbursts of indignation in the Japanese 
press, and of the formal protests filed in Washing- 
ton through the embassies representing the four 
capitals. For each of those concessions trespassed 
upon a Japanese, French, British or Russian sphere 
of influence. 

Mr. Coleman, who was touring the Far East and 
writing articles for the Melbourne Herald, was in 
Tokio when this happened, and does not seem to 
have returned to China to make direct inquiries 
about it. Had he done so, he might have found 
occasion to revise those chapters of his book deal- 
ing with the investment of American capital in 
China, and certain others dealing with the Open 
Door; for in Tokio he obtained only a part of the 
facts, and his most illuminating contribution to the 
incident consists in his extracts from Japanese news- 
papers, denouncing the prospective American in- 
trusion as "reckless." He does not tell us that Paul 
S. Reinsch, who resigned recently as American min- 
ister to Peking, had visited the United States, osten- 
sibly to enlist American capital, just before Mr. 
Carey put in an appearance in China; nor does he 
offer an explanation of those singular concessions, 
every one of which encroached on another nation's 
privileged territory. The explanation, as it came 
unofficially from a Chinese dignitary, was that China 
granted the contracts to see whether the United 
States would stand back of the Open Door policy. 

Of course the United States did not stand back of 
it. It does not seem to be the policy of this Ad- 
ministration to stand back of anything, so far as 



China is concerned. When protests and veiled 
threats began pouring into Washington, the State 
Department declared, in correct diplomatic phrase- 
ology, that Mr. Carey could go hang, that it knew 
nothing about his concessions, that Mr. Relnsch's 
trip had nothing to do with them. Thus was the 
danger of armed conflict averted, in somewhat the 
same manner as when in an earlier day Japan ob- 
jected to an Anglo-American syndicate's proposal 
to build a Manchurian railway. It was averted by 
backing down. 

Nobody, no sensible body, wants war; and if 
backing down from the Open Door theory will con- 
tinue to prevent war nobody should object to that 
course. But everyone, who is familiar with the 
present precarious balance of power in China real- 
izes that the Open Door is the best hope of eliminat- 
ing that system and preserving the peace and dig- 
nity of the Republic. Our vacillating policy im- 
perils the world's Well-being. All of the Powers, 
moreover, which protested against the American 
concessions in barred regions, were signatories to 
more than one covenant pledging themselves to the 
Open Door. None of them wants it, to be sure, 
because its establishment would mean for them the 
surrender of rich privileges. They have given it 
merely their robust vocal approbation, and at pres- 
ent that approval is as much a diplomatic irony as 
are the assurances of distinguished consideration 
with which passports are handed to the expelled 
envoy of an enemy nation. 

Yet Mr. Coleman although it was not his first' 
journey to the Far East nor his first book about 
the intricate situation there adopted an attitude 
of suave credulity toward the Open Door, even in 
Manchuria. This is not said in derogation, for the 
method has its advantages. We perceive in Mr. 
Coleman a bland, inquisitive, open-minded journal- 
ist, plying Japanese and Chinese, British and Ameri- 
cans, with a multitude of naive queries, then setting 
down their answers with meticulous care and even- 
handed justice. That is the picture he intends to 
present, and it is effective. Partisanship has blown 
hotly, like an Asian typhoon, through nearly all 
the books written about the Far East. Apparently 
no man can live there for any great length of time 
without becoming a bitter propagandist for one side 
or the other. And so Mr. Coleman's appearence 
of correct impartiality is as refreshing as a rain- 
wet wind after a dust-storm. If there is artfulness 
in his book it is in his seeming to be gradually per- 
suaded, against his cordial better self, that the

Japanese are indeed the callous, furtive, and im- 
perialistic people so many observers have come to 
fear they are. 

It is not until Chapter XXVIII, in the account of 
what Mr. Coleman likes to call his "Open Door 
hunt" in Manchuria, that he gives unmistakable evi- 
dence of a suspicion crystallizing into conviction. 
He learned in Manchuria that Japanese who shipped 
goods by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha or the Osaka 
Shosen Kaisha, the country's largest steamship 
lines, through Dairen (Dalny) into Manchuria, and 
all Japanese manufacturers of fifteen specified 
groups of commodities, or dealers in them, got a 
thirty per cent reduction on through freight rates, 
and that there was a fifteen per cent reduction on 
certain specified local shipments. In other words, 
Mr. Coleman professes to have found first-hand evi- 
dence of discrimination against competing nation- 
als. The Melbourne Herald must have thought this 
an important "beat," but Americans are too famil- 
iar with the evil of railroad rebates to share deeply 
Mr. Coleman's shocked disillusion at his discovery. 
He recalls a familiar clause from John Hay's fam- 
ous letter of 1899, to which Japan and all the other 
Powers interested in China subscribed : 

. . . and no higher railroad charges over lines built, 
controlled or operated within its 'sphere' [shall be imposed] 
on merchandise belonging to citizens or subjects of other 
nationalities transported through such 'sphere' than shall 
be levied on similar merchandise belonging to its own 
nationals transported over equal distances. 

Americans are likely to dismiss that phrase with 
a shrug. Surely they are not under any delusions 
about it. They may regard with some disquiet, 
however, the statement that the Japanese habitually 
decline to pay likin, the Chinese local octroi, and 
that the other nationals, not to be put at disad- 
vantage, habitually follow suit. This is so much 
like an infringement of China's sovereignty that the 
difference can scarcely be detected. 

"Some say the door is open," a Britisher in Man- 
churia told Mr. Coleman, "but a Japanese sentry 
is standing just inside with a rifle in his hands. I, 
for one, do not care if there is a whole regiment of 
Japanese just inside, with rifles loaded and bayonets 
fixed, if I have the British Government back of me." ' 

An American said of the Open Door, "It is closed 
to the man who is afraid of the Japanese, or whose 
Government is apt to forget that he is still on earth 
when he tries to do business outside its borders." 

If the trader thus expects the armed might of 
his country to be arrayed behind him, and if (as 
is the case with nationals other than Americans) he 
is assured that his expectation is justified, what 
hope is there that peace can be maintained between 
Powers jealously guarding, each of them, one or 
more special privileged zones? 



Mr. Coleman discusses neither remedies in gen- 
eral, nor the Shantung problem in particular. Per- 
haps at the time of writing he thought, as did 
nearly every one else, that Shantung would remain 
in possession of China, to whom the province had 
legally reverted when the Republic declared war 
on Germany. He is much more concerned with 
the venomous Anglophobia of the Japanese press 
during the war. By the time he reaches a de- 
tailed discussion of this issue, he is frankly out of 
patience with the Japanese. 

Now the Japanese Government believes that to 
spare the rod is to spoil the press. In peace and 
war, fines are imposed upon editors for the slight- 
est transgressions and for more serious offenses 
there are graver punishments. Nowhere is the 
regimentation of publicity so rigorously enforced. 
So that Mr. Coleman rightly concludes that the 
attitude of Japanese editorial writers had the sanc- 
tion of a Government under treaty alliance with 
Britain. But at the time this was happening Ger- 
many had rosy hopes of victory. The incident is 
past and ought to be done with, for subsequently 
Japan, although she did not even prevent the escape 
of German warships from eastern waters, and did 
precious little in any other direction toward win- 
ning the war, proved an ally ostensibly loyal 
enough. Mr. Coleman seems to think the news- 
paper strictures had some connection with the Brit- 
ish embargo on Japanese cotton, and by way of 
retaliation goes into detail regarding the sweat- 
shop labor conditions in Japan. He describes the 
employment in factories there of great numbers 
of girls of thirteen years or more. He tells how 
they work eleven hours a day or night, at wages of 
from ten to seventeen cents a day, about one-half 
of which is repaid to the employer for upkeep. He 
gives, moreover, instances of Japanese business 
duplicity and statistics of Japanese industrial con- 
ditions; and although he speaks of himself as an 
American, he translates sen and yen* and taels 
throughout the book into pounds and pence. Some 
of the passages, indeed, have almost the flavor of 
a British commercial attache's report. 

It cannot be said that Mr. Coleman has actually 
unveiled the Far East; but despite his rapid jour- 
nalistic method and his somewhat haphazard as- 
sembling of facts, he manages in the end to give 
an enlightening outlook on that portion of the 
world. And his disclosures are worth the serious 
attention of all those who realize that, with the 
fate of nations balanced on an Oriental sword's 
edge, much may depend upon our intelligent ac- 
quaintance with conditions there.

THE DIAL 



A FORTNIGHTLY 



IKE COLLAPSE OF THE PEACE TREATY AND Cov- 
enant is no tribute to the sagacity of American 
statesmanship in the Senate. It merely registers 
the pathetic failure of European diplomacy to take 
advantage of our assistance in laying down the 
foundation of a new order. The peace of Ver- 
sailles was dictated, not in the interests of peace- 
dom, but in the interests of various bellicose, con- 
tentions, and self-sufficient nationalisms. The Cov- 
enant sheltered and perpetuated a series of alli- 
ances and strategic seizures whose spirit was repug- 
nant to the best traditions of American liberalism. 
The Senate's response to the demand of European 
statesmen that we stabilize their intrigues and con- 
geal their animosities was characteristic. The Sen- 
ate said, in effect, that if Europe wished to play 
the old game of strategic, warlike diplomacy, then 
America would revert likewise to her ancient policy 
of strategic isolation. In the face of a threaten- 
ing European imperialism, an instinctive and re- 
actionary provincialism was the almost inevitable 
answer. Since Europe would not go forward with 
President Wilson's idealism into the new world, 
it can now prepare itself to go backward with 
the ghost of President Cleveland into the armed 
animosities of an earlier generation. As for the 
United States, it has now returned to almost the 
same position that it occupied prior to its entrance 
into the war, with such due allowances as must 
be made for a heightened nationalism and an in- 
creased willingness to set aside arbitration treaties 
in favor of a poisonously armed military system. 

IN VIEW OF THE LAMENTABLE FUTILITIES OF INTER- 

national statesmanship it should be plain to every 
candid observer that the peace of the world can- 
not be entrusted to governments that reach the sum- 
mit of their power and glory in breaking it. A 
governmental coalition to enforce peace is an anom- 
aly: the sort of "peace" that was foreshadowed by 
the League was a morbid state of political quies- 
cence. An enforced peace is not the way to a new 
polity: it is a move in the direction of making the 
defects of the old polity universal. To talk about 
enforcing peace under military pressure is as fatu- 
ous as to talk of enforcing civilization by dyna- 
mite. Peacedom is not a rule that can be laid 
down: it is a structure that must be built up. The 
need of the moment is the invention of instruments 
and institutions and modes of thought which will 



effect the transition from wardom to peacedom 
from the macerated "civilization" of No Man's 
Land t the strenuous and edifying realities of the 
great culture regions of the world. Fortunately a 
great part of these instruments and institutions are 
not within the province of the state. Hence Amer- 
ica's temporary isolation from Europe, as a result 
of the collapse of the Treaty and Covenant, need 
not handicap the efforts to create a new order. The 
field for voluntary activity is large. If there be 
need for rough definition of the sort of enterprise 
Americans should seek to promote in the interest 
of a broad and effective internationalism, let the 
following suggestions serve tentatively as samples 
of imperative constructive. endeavor. Let America's 
universities band together, for one thing, to co- 
operate with those of Europe and Asia in building 
up a League of Universities. This, as the dis- 
tinguished sociologists, Messrs. Geddes and Bran- 
ford have pointed out in Our Social Inheritance, 
would serve as the necessary spiritual safeguard 
to those actual or incipient internationalisms in 
industry and administration whose temporal dom- 
inance might otherwise prove dangerous to the 
peoples involved in their organization. Such a 
League of Universities would naturally have to 
develop a world clearing-house. In the first place 
it would provide, on a scale only dimly previsioned 
in the Rhodes scholarships, for a far-reaching ex- 
change of students : and with this would go a natural 
increase in the number and range of exchange pro- 
fessorships. In addition to an internationalization 
of personnel, similar steps would have to be taken 
with materiel, and Ostwald's plan for a standard- 
ization and circulation of books and periodicals 
would again come to the foreground. This, in 
turn, should lead to the development of the Inter- 
national Institute of Bibliography at Brussels, and 
the duplication in great part of its equipment in 
the leading culture capitals of every great region. 
Complementary with this work goes the project 
for a unique model of our planet, as brought for- 
ward and designed by the great georgrapher, Eli- 
see Reclus. The construction of such a model in 
at least one great city would make it possible for 
the student of international affairs, and the lay- 
man as well, to withdraw from the petulant tu- 
mult of rival schemes and policies, and survey 
the globe as a whole, modeled in accurate relief; 
thence to consult a library housed in the 
same building and stocked with a literature which

should set forth in detail every physical and so- 
ciological feature of the earth's being, as far as 
science has explored. For lack of such a concrete 
visualization of the solid bases of man's existence, 
the (diversity of climates and places and peoples, 
we follow too blindly the blankly deceptive ab- 
stractions of ignorant politicians, historians, and 
publicists. The project for such a globe should 
be pushed again, therefore, with renewed vigor, 
for it would be an earnest of our readiness to think 
of the affairs of peoples in terms of their reaction 
throughout the planet as a whole. Following the 
scheme of an international organization of schol- 
ars, an international labor exchange for doctors, 
journalists, and engineers presents itself as a cor- 
relative task. It would serve to assist in con- 
structing that international frame of mind in which 
any material scheme for world-wide cooperation 
must hang. In the interim, while we set the stage 
for the genuine internationalism of peacedom, we 
must also master in our own communities the 
new part we shall have to' play. We must adjust 
the internal life and habit of the nation to the 
ramifying world relations of the Great Industry. 
The policy of our state on immigration, on tariffs, 
on military armament, stands in need of close 
scrutiny, for as long as we act on the principle of 
bellicose national isolation the practical world- 
wide cooperation which the Great Industry enforc- 
es by its own logic will have to buck the current 
of sentiment and impulse and in the critical 
moment sentiment and impulse will prevail. Our 
educational system likewise, in so far as it en- 
forces subordination of individuals and groups 
to the state, and in so far as it places blind "pat- 
riotism" at a higher level than intelligent (critical) 
citizenship, must be transformed drastically 
enough to meet the needs of the Coming Polity. 
In short, we must provide an outlet for the forces 
of free association and creative enterprise, in 
order to rid ourselves of the compulsions and 
dogmatisms and ultimate physical disasters of 
wardom within the circle of belligerent national 
states. Peacedom, it is plain, cannot be enacted at 
a session of parliament, any more than peace it- 
self could be effected at the private councils of 
Versailles. A long and tedious process of transi- 
tion must intervene. To avoid the crippling steril- 
ity of war or the caesarean operation of revolu- 
tion we must conceive a new society and face the 
long travail of its birth. 

1 O THE BALANCE-OF-POWER SYSTEM BELONGS, IN 

large measure, the credit for preserving the in- 
ternational tranquility of Europe in the decades 
which followed the Franco-Prussian War; but this 
system alone could not have achieved the pacifica- 
tion of a continent which, since the Napoleonic 
era, had been disturbed more often by revolu- 
tions than by international conflicts. It is to these 



that Europe owed the Great Peace. In the course 
of the general upheaval, forces which had been 
long in developing realized their strength in quick- 
ly acquired rights; the external Balance of Power 
was supplemented by an internal Balance of 
Privilege the peace of international checks and 
balances by the peace of political democracy. It 
is fundamentally characteristic of the era of the 
Great Peace that it witnessed the substitution of 
geographic grouping for social stratification as 
the fundamental principle of human association. 
This shift of emphasis was the natural concomitant 
of the leveling tendencies of nationalism and poli- 
tical democracy. It is true certain groups, such 
as the Roman Catholic clergy, held out for strati- 
fication heedless of political boundaries, but the 
fundamental concept of equality before the law 
had its way, and the man, the citizen, came to be 
regarded as primarily an inhabitant of a certain 
district and above all as a national of a certain 
state. The geographic, political, national concept 
of society was so completely realized during the 
latter half of the nineteenth century that the world 
seemed to have come to a dead center. Any 
amount of writing and thinking was done on the 
assumption that society had now crystallized in 
its final form. The political revolution had run 
its course; the economic revolution had not come, 
and might never come; the civilized world was, 'in 
its broad outlines at least, a finished structure. 
This attitude of mind is by no means a new phe- 
nomenon. In history consolidation fellows regu- 
larly upon convulsion complacency upon con- 
quest. Patriarchal, civic, imperial, and feudal 
societies have placed varying emphasis upon or- 
ganization by area as against organization by class, 
and each in turn has been regarded as the final 
form of society, destined for reformation but not 
for revolution. It is not surprising then that pre- 
war political society was accepted as an ultimate 
achievement. Nor is it sacrilige to question the 
validity of this acceptance. 

\ HE GREAT WAR THREATENED THE STATUS QUO 
only in its superficial aspect. Indeed it might 
have been expected that the triumph of the Allies, 
who had accepted the territorial, anti-class concept 
of society even more completely than the Germans, 
might result in the establishment of political de- 
mocracy as the final form of society. Fortunately 
or not depending upon 'the point of view the 
war .has had two indirect results which threaten 
the destruction of the very system supposedly safe- 
guarded by the Entente victory. In the course of 
the Allied reorganization for conquest, many of the 
liberties supposedly inherent in the system of de- 
mocracy have been cancelled, while in Russia the 
validity of the system itself is now denied. This 
state of things has resulted in a degree of mental 
confusion which was quite unknown before the

revolution that was dreamed of, seem now actual- 
ly to overlap. The partisan of political democracy 
realizes that he has lost much of what he once 
possessed; but a protest may mark him as pro- 
Bolshevist just as a protest during the war would 
have marked him as pro-German. The radical, 
on the other hand, expends a considerable amount 
of energy in the liberal cause, when he might better 
realize that between him and the liberal the like- 
nesses are superficial, while the differences are of 
the fundamental sort. The question actually at 
issue between the two camps is this : is our society 
bound finally to a geographic, political organiza- 
tion? And if not, what is the alternative? When 
liberalism no longer makes a fetich of political 
democracy when radicalism no longer talks about 
the substitution of one dictatorship for another 
we may be reaoy for a frank discussion of the 
desirability, and the means, of substituting "work- 
manship" for citizenship federated industrial 
groups for geographic units or antagonistic classes. 
The proposal is that economic association be re- 
stored to a place it has not occupied since the 
patriarchal family was the fundamental unit of 
society. Theoretically the case should be judged 
as between political democracy at its best on the 
one hand, and industrial democracy on the other. 
Practically foolishly, as the conservatives must 
eventually realize we have been deprived of 
much of the material of a reasoned judgment by 
the setting of a deformed and underfed democracy 
of votes to oppose an increasingly attractive de- 
mocracy of work. 

1 HE MODIFICATION OF BRITISH POLICY TOWARD 

Russia, following upon the triple reverse of Yu- 
denitch, Denikin, and Kolchak, promises a reason- 
ably early solution of the Baltic complex. Three 
separate groups have interests on the Baltic shore. 
The German expansionists in this region have had 
the help of a powerful indigenous nobility, Ger- 
manic in race and sympathies, heirs of the Teutonic 
Knights and 1 the Sword Brothers of the Middle 
Ages, and real if not recognized rulers of the Baltic 
provinces under the czars. In spite of this, the 
whole German Baltic scheme would doubtless have 
fallen to pieces after the military collapse of the 
Central Empires if the Allies had not given the 
Germans permission to remain in "those territories 
which before the war had formed part of the Rus- 
sian Empire," which territories the Germans had 
already occupied (Armistice, Article XII). Never- 
theless the Germans withdrew their lines consid- 
erably, continuing in some areas to meddle in 
local affairs, elsewhere leaving the coast clear for 
a three-cornered fight on the part of the Junker 
nobility and merchants, the Lettish, Esthonian, and 
Lithuanian nationalists, and the native and imported 
Bolsheviki. In the course of this contest, new 
bourgeois governments, anti-German and anti-Bol- 
shevist in character, came into control of the three 



mid-Baltic states, with Von der Goltz's unwelcome 
troopers still billeted upon them. This arrange- 
ment seemed adequate for the defense of the new 
Eastern Front, but certainly it gave no promise of 
producing the great anti-Bolshevist offensive which 
was necessary to the fulfillment of Allied policy. 
Military leaders were agreed that Bolshevism 
ought to be crushed, but England, France, and the 
Germans were by no means of one mind as to 
the instrument to be used. From the beginning, 
France had held out for Poland. This poverty- 
stricken country, rolled flat by invading armies, 
plagued by a Semitic problem that equals our own 
Negro question in the hatred it engenders, over- 
loaded already with territories peopled by Ger- 
mans, Ukrainians and White Russians this small 
and thin-spread nation should be given a free hand 
in the Baltic so said the French. The Poles have 
continued their suicidal advance eastward into 
Russia, but the task of pacifying the Baltic lands 
has not yet been assigned them; the British had a 
counter-plan which had to be triect out first. The 
Esthonian, Latvian and Lithuanian governments 
had from the beginning been favorably disposed 
toward the British. But, for the launching of an 
offensive against Petrograd, England had need of 
an instrument more pliable than any she already 
possessed; to meet this need, the Russian North- 
western Government was created, and shortly there- 
after was made the recipient of a loan. Judging 
from the energy of the Bolshevist counter-attack, 
it is probable that Yudenitch could not have suc- 
ceeded in pacifying northwest Russia, even under 
the most favorable conditions. That the condi- 
tions were not altogether favorable is due to the 
fact that a third group, also interested in the paci- 
fication of the Slavs, decided at an inopportune 
time to do some campaigning on their own account. 
The force in this case was a German-Russian one, 
under the command of Colonel Bemondt-Avalov, 
and the political machine organized to take charge 
of the territory to be redeemed was called the 
West Russian Government. According to the Lon- 
don Times, the German supporters of this move- 
ment were still sufficiently interested in the drang 
nach Osten by proxy to promise the Russians a 
free hand in Persia and Turkey. The Bemondt 
enterprise, referred to by a German Socialist paper 
as a "dress-rehearsal of the German counter-revo- 
lution," did not differ from the English under- 
taking in outcome. Yudenitch's forces were push- 
ed back by the Bolsheviki and have been absorbed 
by the Esthonian army. Bemonot's contingent was 
beaten by the Letts, before it came in sight of the 
Bolshevist frontier, and is now following Von 
der Goltz's Iron Division in all haste along the 
road to Germany. As a next step, the Esthonians, 
Letts, and Lithuanians are again proposing to talk 
peace with the Bolsheviki. If the British have 
consented to the conference, it is doubtless because 
they hope to preserve a foothold for friendship on 
the Baltic shore.

Casual Comment 

IT REMAINS TO BE* SEEN WHETHER THE PEOPLE 

can be brought to pageantry by a process of attri- 
tion, for the persistence with which Percy Mac- 
Kaye discovers "new forms" of community drama, 
and his zeal in heralding them, foster the suspi- 
cion that such is his intention. He continues to 
pour out his "hermit soul" in one masque after 
another a placid stream of allegory in the mead- 
ows of democracy. If Mr. MacKaye were called 
upon to otive a chariot around the Harvard sta- 
dium, we are convinced that he would turn the 
performance into a community affair; more than 
that, he would contrive to harness percheron, 
pacer, and pack horse together, and then be sur- 
prised at his inability to get the necessary speed 
out of the combination. 

The latest fagots to, be tossed upon Mr. Mac- 
Kaye's smouldering bonfire are Washington: The 
Man Who Made. Us (Knopf), and The Will of 
Song (Boni & Liveright), the latter in cooperation 
with Harry Barnhart, after "considerable wrestling 
of the spirit" and "soul searching." In Washing- 
ton, there are some elements of drama, and some 
of folk lore ancJ some of balladry, but in the 
fusion they fail to work up into the desired homo- 
geneity. The mood is now one thing, and now an- 
other; the reader is alternately hurried and halted. 
Considered by themselves, certain of the dramatic 
scenes are marked with a degree of intensity and 
feeling which is well sustained. Considered 1 by 
themselves, certain of the "transitions" have charm 
and color. On the other hand, there are times 
when the MacKaye technique is not many paces 
removed from that of the hated commercial thea- 
ter, as expressed in such "morality plays" as Ex- 
perience and Everywoman. Washington is desig- 
nated as a "ballad play," and since, as the author 
affirms in the appendix, "critical interpreters are 
habitually more slow than creative workers to de- 
tect and illuminate things very important poten- 
tially," we deem it no more than discreet to quote 
Mr. MacKaye's own evaluation of the new form, 
"whereby an on-flowing continuity and variety of 
action (with no heavy sets of the old regime to 
impede it) enables the dramatist (like the sculp- 
tor) to project a manifold frieze of figures struc- 
turally related, and leads to a large new freedom 
in his art, akin to that of the Elizabethan tech- 
nique, but (thanks to our modern art of lighting) 
wihout the starkness of that." Further on, he 
likens the "ballad play" to a "motivated vaude- 
ville form," which strikes us as a more accurate 
and less diffuse analogy. 

; As for the results, it cannot be affirmed' that the 
breath of life has been breathed into the central 
figure, save in a vaguely romanic way. We have 
the curtain withdrawn on Washington in episodic 
snatches, some highly dramatic, others almost pas- 
toral. Mr. MacKaye encourages the general to 
do stagey things, while at Valley Forge, for ex- 



ample, the dialogue is an easy give-and-take, smell- 
ing of the lamp and not of reality. Instead of 
humanizing Washington, the author's alchemy has 
but changed a bronze figure into a sert of golden 
treasury. 

The Will of Song, a dramatic service for a two 
days' song festival, is an answer to the thundering 
query: How may the surging tides of Man be 
sluiced in conceits of Art, without losing their 
primal glory and momentum? This little job of 
engineering is to be accomplished, we discover, 
through the medium of the Group Person, wherein 
the untrained singing of the people becomes a 
structural factor in the festival. It is apparent 
that this use of the Group Person is analogous to 
the familiar congregational "responses" in reli- 
gious service, and although it may play minor 
roles, we question the wisdom of "starring" it, as 
Mr. MacKaye says we should at least not until 
the community millennium, still apparently some 
distance off despite the best efforts of the masque 
maker. 



1 HERE IS A HUMOR SO DELICATE THAT FEW AUTHORS 

% dare to indulge it, and critics hardly ever. It is 
all compact of suave irony and artless wit. It is 
a humor so fine that one is least sure of it when 
it is most present. Something of this quality is 
to be had in Mrs. Wilkinson's remarkable book: 
The New Voices (Macmillan). There is none of 
the heavy seriousness of Sir Thomas Browne in her 
monody on death: 

Of the radical poets in general it may be said that most 
of their work will die, and die very soon. But that may 
be said just as truly of conservative poets. Nearly all the 
work of nearly all poets dies, and dies soon. 

One reads on, in a kind of "drowsy reverie, re- 
lieved by nervous thrills," which is Santayana's 
definition of what music means to most people. 
So Mrs. Wilkinson's book is music? Not exactly. 
But one has a sense of its calm fluency, the fluency 
of the teacher who brings up poets in the way 
they should go; the calmness that will spoil the 
poetry rather than speed the rod. 

The author is at her best when she considers 
the radicals. "They are," she admits, with a kind 
of terrified admiration, "undeniably alarmingly 
clever." Her remarks on El'ot would distinguish 
any volume of crit'cism: "Notice these lines from 
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock' by T. S. 
Eliot: 

'Let us go then, you and I, 

When the evening is spread out against the sky 
Like a patient etherized upon a table.' " 

There are innumerable possible comments upon 
these lines. On what aspect of them does Mrs. 
Wilkinson dwell? With unimpugnable honesty 
she goes to the clear truth of the matter: "This 
comparison," she says, and who will deny her? 
"would never come 'nto the mind of a stupid man, 
of an unsophisticated man." It is their sophistica-

tion that she seems most to shy at. Of Mr.' Pound 
she says, "He is so clever that one mentions him 
with trepidation, knowing how much amused he 
would be at the wrong thing said." One would 
fain offer the lady one's hand in the darkness of 
that knowledge. But she gains courage with her 
period, and shortly passes judgment: "The truth 
of the matter is that Mr. Pound is too clever to 
be a poet." What will you reply to that, Pound? 
All your cleverness cannot get you out of that. 
It will only damn you deeper. Now at last, how- 
ever, we know what the unfortunate man meant 
in his Lake Isle, when he cried: 

God, O Venus, Mercury, patron of thieves, 

Lend me a little tobacco-shop, or install me in any prot 

fession 
Save this damned profession of writing, where one needs 

one's brains all the time. 

It was the cry of self-knowledge. But Miss 
Wilkinson does not leave the matter there. It is in 
her elucidation that one gets that fine humor where- 
of we spoke earlier. "A poem subtly charged with 
superiority," she states gravely, "will hardly give 
pleasure to many readers, because they themselves 
never have cause to know what conscious superior- 
ity is like, and therefore cannot share the mood." 

1 HE SEASON OF 1918-1919 WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE 

dullest for art that New York has known in re- 
cent tinies. The war had succeeded in diverting 
the minds of both practitioners and public from 
almost all interest in art, and it was not until 
the very end of the season when the Metropolitan 
Museum organized its great exhibition of Courbet, 
that anything on a considerable scale was at- 
tempted. The galleries along Fifth Avenue, kept 
a mournful silence, knowing they would arouse 
only a very slight interest, though they should 
assume the expense of important exhibitions. This 
year things will be different: the artists are 
thinking of their own problems again, and the 
public once more wants to know something of 
beauty. No visitor to the Museum can have failed 
to get an impression of the eager interest of the 
throngs which are now visiting it nor can he have 
failed to note the change from the listlessness in 
the attendance there a year ago. 

A particularly fortunate sign of the times is the 
establishment of the De Zayas Gallery at 549 Fifth 
Avenue. It is the successor of the Modern Gal- 
lery, which did valuable work from 1915 onward; 
it will continue that work in larger quarters and 
with greater scope. The opening exhibition of the 
gallery was one of Chinese art, a very remarkable 
group of early paintings, formed by Charles Vig- 
nier. It was followed by a shewing of African Ne- 
gro art, of which we had already seen much in Mr. 
De Zayas' exhibitions. Later there will be Gothic 
sculpture, and European and American painting. 
An exhibition open till December 13 shows nine- 
teenth century art at its apogee, with works by Cour- 



bet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cezanne, and Matisse. 
Will certain critics promptly announce that the 
showing of older works at this gallery is a proof 
that modern art has "collapsed"? They have been 
( diligently endeavoring to inculcate that idea for 
some years now, undismayed, in public^ at least, 
when their predictions of the disappearance of 
the moderns fail of realization. What has hap- 
pened is that modern art, having outlived the 
period where it seemed sensational, has settled 
down to the place in public inerest at which it 
was evidently to arrive. Comparatively few lay- 
men have time or inclination to make the effort 
needed for the appreciation of new ideas, but the 
number of those who have reached a liking for 
modern work goes on slowly and steadily increas- 
ing. As to the artists, there is evidence on every 
side that the ideas of even ten years ago no longer 
satisfy them, and they are making diverse and 
among the better men very earnest efforts to 
advance. From Paris the news is that the men 
looked upon as leaders before the war are quietly 
continuing with the work or with evolved forms 
of the work we have seen from them before. The 
first Salon d'Automne since 1913 will doubtless 
bring forth new talent, as will the Independants 
in the spring and as fresh ideas appear we shall 
doubtless feel that the moderns of yesterday are 
quite on good terms with the innovators of preced- 
ing decades. The importance of the De Zayas Gal- 
lery will be that it will give us a chance to see what 
is developing in European and American art, and 
to see the relation of our contemporary masters 
with those of the past. 

A READING OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE 

Committee on an Enlarged Program for the Amer- 
ican Library Service calls to mind the fact that 
the year since Armistice Day has exhibited in cer- 
tain unofficial war activities a greater tenacity of 
life than .the army itself possessed. For the private 
soldier, the Great War was a sordid business to be 
gotten over and out of, as soon as possible. Cer- 
tainly the army offered nothing in the way of per- 
sonal advancement or day-to-day satisfaction that 
could prompt him to follow romantic precedent 
and refuse to be demobilized. A very different feel- 
ing attached to the work of the various welfare 
organizations, now clamorous for a place in the sun 
of peace. As for the rank and file of the welfare 
workers, there is no question but that they got 
from their daily tasks a genuine satisfaction not 
shared by the soldier; they liked it, and they do 
not want to be demobilized. With less of the satis- 
faction of work, the staff officers of these organiza- 
tions had more of the satisfaction of power ; they 
liked it, and they do not want to be demobilized. 
Rank and file together, each of these organizations 
in fact constitutes an army at peace; and, true to 
type, each is trying to find or make a war that will 
justify its continued existence. It will be well

enough, then, for the citizen who was be-buttoned 
in a dozen campaigns during the war to ask him- 
self, as one new peace-drive after another ad- 
vances upon him, whether the organization con- 
cerned was made for the job it proposes to under- 
take, or the job for the organization. With this 
consideration in mind, it must be said that the 
preliminary report of the A. L. A. committee is 
not a wholly satisfactory and convincing document 
hardly an adequate basis, one would say, for the 
proposed appeal to public generosity. Certain 
features of the program such as library extension, 
the examination and certification of librarians, and 
propaganda to increase the use of libraries are 
most commendable. On the other hand the pro- 
posal to spend $50,000 in the preparation of an 
International Bibliography of Humanistic Litera- 
ture is a flight in the face of Providence; the com- 
plete duplication of the bibliography of the In- 
ternational Institute of Bibliography at Brussels 
could probably be arranged for at a cost of $5,000. 
In the very fact that $2,000,000 is the goal fixed for 
the drive there lies the suggestion that large-scale 
operations too suddenly developed may involve 
large-scale waste. If the Association desires to 
overcome this impression there is yet time for a 
more specific statement of its aims, or a reduction 
of its budget to more modest terms. 



NE WHO ENGAGES THE SERVICES OF A PRESS 

clipping bureau does so with the pleasant assur- 
ance that no shears will be spared in his behalf, 
and generally in the belief that no matter what 
topic he may be interested in, a handful of clippings 
will be forthcoming with the next turn of the print- 
ing presses. Yet we tremble to imagine how slender 
would be the yield if one commissioned a clipping 
bureau to send all the genuine literature appearing 
in the daily newspapers. Closing the fragrant 
pages of Lafcadio Hern's Fantastics (Houghton 
Mifflin), which is a collection of sketches written 
for New Orleans newspapers in the eighties, one 
cannot help comparing these sensitive, fragile out- 
pourings, which seem to have lost none of their 
freshness, with the paucity of anything resembling 
literature in our dailies of the present dispensation. 
Hearn touched upon all manner of themes some 
of which he was content to clothe as the merest 
fragments but all have charm, a touch of brood- 
ing melancholy, or a bit or rich imagery. Writ- 
ings of parallel or even of approximate quality 
seldom grace the transient pages of the "latest ex- 
tra." One never hesitates to toss aside the break- 
fast table companion after digesting the headlines, 
for fear of missing some rare gem of creative fan- 
cy, hidden beneath pure advertising. Literature 
has been displaced in this age of the eight-column 
"streamer" and the comic "strip." The clipping 
bureau, eager as it might be to oblige, would be 
doomed to disappointment if it sought to supply 



clippings of that product. Its function is but to 
serve the busy person who is impelled by voca- 
tion or vanity to read up on his "specialty." It 
is the hireling alike of the public benefactor and 
the public nuisance, with the latter generally gar- 
nering the larger stack of clippings. It will under- 
take to provide you with everything from clipped 
calumny in column lengths to puffs a paragraph 
long, but should you ask for the things of the 
imagination "dreams of a tropical city," as Hearn 
calls his Fantastics your order cannot be filled.

BY THE MERGING OF THE TWO FORTNIGHTLY

DIAL will become a monthly. It will also diverge 
in more important aspects from THE DIAL of the 
last year and a half, particularly in its greater em- 
phasis on art and literature. Or more precisely, in 
addition to essays we expect to publish some fiction 
and drawings. We can assure all concerned that 
our choice of material will be independent of the 
conventional considerations, independent, that is, 
"jusques au feu exclusive." But for fear this 
become the occasion of a manifesto, we leave our 
readers to form their opinion of us from what 
we shall do rather than from what we say at pres- 
ent. 

J_ HE PRESENT NUMBER CONCLUDES VOLUME LXVII 

of THE DIAL. The Index to this volume and the 
Index to Volumes LXVI, which has been held up

Notes on New Books 

ECSTASY. By Louis Couperus. 240 pages. 
Dodd, Mead. 

All our lives many of us have believed in the 
phlegm of the Dutchman. Washington Irving 
limned him with such broad strokes that we took 
him amusedly for granted as a comfortable per- 
son, thanking the gods that they had not made him 
poetical. But in this novel, written twenty-seven 
years ago and only now translated into English, 
there are no venturesome patroons and robust 
mevrouws. These are patricians, delicately i>red, 
temperamental, the men either diplomats, military 
officers, or sportsmen, the women vaguely restless 
exotics, charming and fragile. Theirs is an old- 
world social system whose palisade seems insur- 
mountable alike for the exoticism within and the 
sturdiness without. 

Ecstasy has an even more highly charged, 
atmosphere than Small Souls, though both deal 
chiefly with the' emotions of one woman against 
the background of her family. It is a story of 
love, not a love story. Taco Quaerts wishes to 
adore a madonna in his soulful reactions after 
wild and sordid escapades, leaving his brute nature 
quite untrammeled to riot elsewhere. Cecile Van 
Even loves him passionately. She does not wish 
to be a goddess, placed on a pedestal and wor- 
shipped. Yet she feels that if she would love the 
man unselfishly, she must be what he wishes. She 
must remain the pure, condescending madonna of 
his contrite hours. So she mounts the pedestal 
and neither of them is satisfied. The ecstasies of 
worship and renunciation are not for a lifetime. 
Taco Quaerts is an unworthy hero, but Cecile 
needs only a normal setting to make her a fas- 
cinating, human heroine. 

As in Small Souls there is a sensitive, unhappy 
adolescent who, one fancies, must have something 
of Couperus himself in him, he is so understand- 
ingly handled. Most of Couperus' characters are 
tragic, les sthrough circumstance than because of 
their own too finely fibred, shakily poised egos. 
They are so futile that not even such an artist as 
Couperus man make a genuine story out of 
them. 

WAR IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. By Kermit 
Roosevelt. 253 pages. Scribner. 

The picturesque title of this book is indicative 
of its quality. We follow Captain Roosevelt with 
the British troops from Italy to Mesopotamia, 
along the Tigris front and into the Arabian Nights 
as well as the Garden of Eden. The warfare de- 
scribed is rather sketchy compared with the heavy 
trench and forest fighting on the western front. 



Captain Roosevelt was assigned to the Motor Ma- 
chine Gun Corps, and had his full share of dan- 
ger and the difficulties of transportation by desert 
and flood. The last quarter of the book leaves 
Eden for France and finally for "Hunland," where 
the American First Division takes its place in the 
Army of Occupation. 

The book is not remarkable for war data, though 
it does add to our knowledge of that psycho- 
logically important campaign in the near-east. It 
gives the charm of ancient cities, once seaports but 
now inland, and vivid pictures of Turk and Arab 
who "played no favorite but attacked whichever 
side came handier." It is really a valuable bit 
of biography. Captain Roosevelt is keenly alive, 
understands human nature, and writes well. When 
he comes into an oriental town he proceeds to 
make friends, enjoys the people in their own 
homes, finds their bazaars fascinating and even 
becomes useful as an interpreter. His sense of 
humor is always equal to the strain of war, and 
he takes much of his happiness with him in the 
form of books remembered volumes and new 
ones to be bagged from fellow officers or out-of- 
the-way libraries. He fortunately has the "Lu- 
siads" with him when the Arab speeches at a ban- 
quet- become hopelessly long drawn out. He 
quotes Isaiah on the fall of Babylon, and in abund- 
ant, colorful vocabulary, even in turn of phrase 
he often brings Kim and the Plain Tales to mind. 
Strictly speaking, the book has neither beginning 
nor end, climax nor conclusion. It is the rec- 
ord of a few worth-while years in an eventful 
life. 

MRS. MARDEN. By Robert Hichens. 325 
pages. Doran. 

Mrs. Marden is written with such facile celerity 
that it suggests something produced after long re- 
hearsal in the author's brain. The characters 
have the versimilitude of well-trained actors. They 
never hesitate in doing what shall most express the 
quality for which they have been thrust into exist- 
ence. Mrs. Marden herself is as if quite willing 
to reverse Nature's progression and be metamor- 
phosed from a care-free butterfly to a very Freud- 
ian caterpillar in order to convince us that 
Haeckel's doctrine of "emotional necessity" is but 
an inverted proof that a justification for such 
necessity exists. There is in the study of this 
woman whose only son is killed in the war a real 
opportunity for the psychologist who would depict 
a narrowly integrated but self-respecting doubter 
gradually succumbing to the demands of her 
starved emotions. Mr. Hichens, with his church- 
man's view of the universe, scarcely lives up to 
the requirements of the occasion he has -created. 
He sheds no light of intellectual vividness on his 
situation. Indeed, he is as undetached from the 



488 



THE DIAL 



November 29 



circumstances he depicts as his characters them- 
selves. How else the reverence unwarmed by 
humor with which he sets down Emily King's de- 
murely platitudinous confession of faith, or the 
conscious nobility with which he overcomes the 
fastidiousness of an ingrained snobbery and gives 
the discredited medium, Peter Irwin, a due of 
tempered credence. It is only here and there that 
an intuitively selected phrase illuminates Mrs. 
Marden's emotions with its unique appropriate- 
ness. The war has revolutionized Mr. Hichens in 
the literal sense. It has brought him back to a be- 
ginning. His is a mind incapable of rebellion, 
but one feels that within the limitations of this 
incapacity he has reacted authentically to the har- 
rowing events of the last few years. A modified 
Deity, already divested of omnipotence in the 
liberal atmosphere of pre-war days, is here in 
turn dethroned in favor of a veiled incarnation 
of the inscrutably jealous Dictator of Mosaic law. 
However, the breaking down of Mrs. Marden's 
always somewhat blurred individuality is accom- 
plished with little struggle. One recalls in con- 
trast the sharp skepticism of Tolstoy's Ivan Ilytch 
which kept the man alive until his death. 

Mrs. Marden, who is an Anglo-Saxon lady, hav- 
ing renounced her will, is able to pass almost 
imperceptibly from an invited to an enforced 
defeat. 

A SAILOR'S HOME. By Richard Dehan. 370 
pages. Doran. 

The humorist, whether his method be the bold 
one of slapstick comedy, or that of the most in- 
sidious satire, seduces his audience by an unuttered 
but constantly inferred compliment. To exalt one 
person or group of persons convincingly at the 
expense of another this ridicule must be gruonded 
in a profound recognition of the human nature to 
be victimized. If one deals with only a hypo- 
thetical human nature (and this is the case of Mr. 
Dehan) it is impossible to create in the mind of 
the sophisticated reader that attitude of compla- 
cent receptivity which the humorist ideally de- 
mands of his audience. In those incidents of, Eng- 
lish life among seafaring folk and other types of 
diverse humanity, mostly of humble origin, here 
collected, we are nowhere flattered to the kindly 
point of contempt which the slight pleasantries 
of Mr. Dehan's style, in the first few pages of 
the book, led us to anticipate. He writes meander- 
ing sentences that titillate here and there by ter- 
minating in unexpected phraseology, and there is 
an atmosphere of easeful permanence in his back- 
grounds. Ensconced in his armchair England it 
would be delightful to watch inconsequential char- 
acters betray an appropriate and amusing inferi- 
ority, would our vanity permit, but Mr. Dehan has 
too light an opinion of us. He gives us puppet 



groups which undergo labored temporary disar- 
rangements only that he may finally jerk them 
into place with the neat suggestion of a homily. 
Here virtue triumphs, when virtue is sentimentally 
fortified with a bank account, and the divine right 
of kings vested in the person of George V is a 
satisfying belief unimpeached by modernity. The 
humor is crude without the vim and spontaniety 
which are sometimes the ornaments of crudeness, 
and the whole is glossed with fatuous condescen- 
sion toward those individuals whom the author 
sympathetically indicates as belonging to a lower 
order. A snob's edition of W. W. Jacobs. 

MIND AND CONDUCT. By Henry Rutgers Mar- 
shall. 236 pages. Scribner. 

To those who are interested in metaphysics, Dr. 
Rutgers offers an unusual combination of acquaint- 
ance with scientific modes of thought and a pre- 
dilection for abstract speculations. The general 
treatment is from a frankly dualistic point of view, 
with an assumption of "correspondence" between 
psychic processes and physical processes. While 
he acknowledges the tendency of the human mind 
to some form of monism, he does not find such a 
unification necessary, although he inclines to the 
idealistic interpretation, going so far as to attribute 
consciousness to the ultimate elements of the uni- 
verse. There is apparent in various places a con- 
flict in the author's mind between his appreciation 
of scientific formulations as practical working hy- 
potheses, and his own search for ultimate truths. 
Thus, the mechanistic conception "may be quite 
properly employed in practical investigations as a 
valuable tool even by those who hesitate to accept 
it as final;" but the scientist never urges you to ac- 
cept it as final. Emphasis is laid upon the intellect 
as creative, and on the responsibility of using the 
reason for discovering modes of conduct that are 
more adequate than the traditional modes on the 
one hand, and the "intuitional" or instinctive modes 
on the other. 

BRITISH WAR ADMINISTRATION. By John Fair- 
lie. Carnegie Endowment for International 
Peace. Preliminary Economic Studies of the 
War. No. 8. 302 pages. Oxford University 
Press. 

GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION IN WAR TIME AND 
AFTER. By William Franklin Willoughby. 
370 pages. Appleton. 

The unprecedented opportunities afforded by the 
war for experiments in administration lead one to 
turn with interest to any such authoritative dis- 
cussions of governmental organization as these two 
volumes offer. Their pages disclose a bewildering 
number of new agencies which have be.en created 
by the governments of both countries for war pur- 



1919 



THE DIAL

poses a rapid succession of more or less ephemer- 
al commissions, ministries, boards, departments, 
and committees the product of a half blind search 
for agencies that would carry out these purposes. 
And among these seemingly numberless experi- 
ments one searches for new light on administrative 
problems. 

The two books cover much the same field for the 
two countries, but a different emphasis results from 
different methods of approach. Dr. Fairlie, in the 
volume on British War Administration, confines 
himself almost wholly to organization. And the 
introductory chapters on "War Measures in Former 
Times" and "Agencies of Action," together with 
the historical treatment adopted throughout, give 
coordination and a feeling of log'cal development 
which is never quite lost, even through the long 
lists of boards and committees (often quite unac- 
counted for) which follow. 

Dr. Willoughby's Government Organization in 
War Time and After gives no such feeling of unity, 
partly because the work of the regular departments 
of government has not been included, partly for the 
reason that the subject has been presented by prob- 
lems, with a discussion which extends beyond mere 
organization. Each problem is complete in itself: 
a brief statement of the situation, a somewhat de- 
tailed description of the various instruments de- 
vised to cope with it (accompanied by excerpts 
from public documents describing functions and 
powers), some account of the activities undertaken, 
and finally an estimate of the success with which 
the situation was met. Such unfavorable criticisms 
as are given, for example, the estimate of the de- 
fects of the Council of National Defense, are the 
more effective because indulged in sparingly. The 
collection of the important facts of our war-time 
administration, the abundant quotations from laws 
and publ'c documents not always easy to obtain, 
and careful indexing, combine to make Dr. Wil- 
loughby's volume invaluable for reference purposes. 

As to whether we have profited by our war ex- 
periences in administration both authors leave us 
in doubt. The recognized importance of concentra- 
tion of responsibility, at least in time of emergen- 
cy, has perhaps been emphasized. The functioning 
of the War Cabinet of England has been watched 
with interest. Further, the method of controlling 
industry in the United States through federal li- 
censes, and the use of corporations as governmental 
agencies suggest, as Dr. Willoughby points out, 
possible new lines of development in administra- 
tion. There have been other departures from usual 
forms of organization. But the heterogeneity of 
the forms which did, or did not, succeed, leaves a 
growing conviction, as these volumes are read, that 
aside from a reasonable concentration of power 
form is immaterial. The degree of success achieved 
would seem to have been largely determined by the 
degree of personal ability displayed by those 
carrying on the work, and by the spirit in which 
tfieir activities have been received. 



LENIN, the Man and His Work. By Albert 
Rhys Williams, Colonel Raymond Robins and 
Arthur Ransome. 202 pages. Scott & Seltzer. 

The three authors of this book form as queer a 
fraternity as ever came under the eye of the police 
an ex-preacher turned Bolshevist, a colonel of 
the American Red Cross, and a calm-souled jour- 
nalist from England, all brought together by the 
ingenuity of the person first named to discuss the 
work and worth of a terrorist, and all willing to 
concede to him many of the attributes of wisdom 
and respectability. 

Mr. Williams' contribution is the least impres- 
sive of the three, chiefly because it gives too fre- 
quent evidence of unsound and wishful thinking 
as for instance when the author says of the Lenin 
family 

Sensitive to the things of the mind, they became like- 
wise increasingly sensitive to the sufferings of the great 
masses. The beauty and interest of their home life was 
such a contrast to the dullness and misery of the life of 
the millions around them groaning under the tyranny of 
Czardom. 

The chapters are too largely made up of anecdotal 
material and unsupported generalizations, while 
facts relative to the personal life and public career 
of the hero are conspicuous for their absence. The 
author does not miss the opportunity to contrast 
the incisive logic of Lenin with the large flowing 
phrases of Woodrow Wilson and in the very act 
of so doing he steps at least part way toward the 
President's unsure position. 

Colonel Robins, with William Hard for amanu- 
ensis and perhaps for phrasemaker, does much bet- 
ter, and in fact shares honors with the chapters 
reprinted here from Arthur Ransome's Russia in 
1919. Messrs. Robins and Ransome assume none 
of the obligations of biographer or historian. 
Nevertheless by means of quotations from Lenin's 
own utterances they succeed in individualizing the 
man completely, and exhibit in him characteristics 
most encouraging to those familiar wtih the com- 
mon disabilities of the radical mind. It appears 
indeed that Lenin is as impatient with radical cant 
as with the older varieties of jargon. Words in 
their conventional combinations are the least of 
his concerns. He faces the fact that in Russia 
destruction has imposed the obligation of construc- 
tion, and he has made it his special business to 
lead the revolution towards work Labor Discip- 
line. In all the history of revolutions there is 
no more remarkable phenomenon than this: that 
among a high-strung people, in a time of emotional 
exaltation, there has come into leadership a man 
whose dryly practical mind attempts no leaps 
along the road to Utopia: 

He had out-analyzed and out-seen everybody. His books 
and his documents and his reports and his theses and all 
his scholastic methods and manners had not hindered him 
perhaps they had helped him in becoming his party's 
absolute realist and almost absolute ruler.

THE LIFE OF MATTER: An Inquiry and Ad- 
venture. Edited by Arthur Turnbull. 324 
pages. Lippincott; Philadelphia. 

Every form of matter is active and eternal. 
Like causes never product like effects. Action 
and Reaction are unequal. The Law of Causation 
is incredible. No aspect of matter is ever identical 
at any two successive moments of time. Matter 
changes from within, motion emerges. 

We are accustomed to the mysticism of the mys- 
tics who are so certain of the futility of science 
that they will none of it; but Mr. Turnbull has 
studied his science all the sciences and shows 
a very comprehensive acquaintance with the mate- 
rials as well as with the methods of modern sci- 
ence. Like other philosophical minds he seeks 
unity. The increasing knowledge about living 
things, instead of making him emphasize the dif- 
ference between the living and the non-living, 
drives him as it drives men like Jacques Loeb 
to see the common factors in all forms of matter 
and action. But unlike Loeb, he concludes that the 
living and the non-living are alike because every 
atom is living. Modern physics offers data to 
support the theory that "all matter is active," if 
any comfort is to be derived from it; but it is 
hard to see what kinds of satisfactions will accrue 
to those who repudiate all thought of causality. 
The history of medicine alone, or of agriculture 
alone, to say nothing of more abstract fields of 
human interest, ought to serve as an effective anti- 
dote to this particular type of mysticism. 

THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF JAMES MONROE 
TAYLOR; The Biography of an Educator. By 
Elizabeth Hazelton Haight. 391 pages. But- 
ton. 

Thirty years of devotion to a single cause and 
to a single institution constitutes unusually sus- 
tained human endeavor. James Monroe Taylor, 
who died at the close of 1916, left behind him 
sixty-eight years of life, the best three decades of 
which were given to the upbuilding of Vassar Col- 
lege. Today, when equality of opportunity for 
the sexes is axiomatic in American society, and 
when Vassar is only one of many institutions de- 
voting itself to the higher education of women, 
we are likely to underestimate the importance of 
Vassar during the first twenty years of Dr. Tay- 
lor's presidency. True it had already behind it 
twenty difficult years of achievement as the pioneer 
endowed college for women. But the half dozen 
years preceding Dr. Taylor's presidency were years 
of special difficulty and discouragement. The num- 
bef of students was decreasing and the endowment 
was inadequate. From this depression President 
Taylor rescued it. Getting funds was no easy mat- 
ter, but more important still was his victory in re- 



lation to the strongly entrenched reactionary 
concept of the status of woman. A disposition to 
deplore "excessive mentality" was still widely 
manifest. Dr. Taylor's position may be given in 
his own words from an address of the year 1905: 

No one who watches college women for years and really 
knows their interests and work will accept conclusions 
which tend to show that their education reduces or de- 
stroys the normal affections, wants and aspirations. But 
even this leaves unanswered her claim to decide for her- 
self as to the using of her mental faculties. Matthew 
Vassar's words are still of weight: "Woman, having re- 
ceived from her Creator the same intellectual constitution 
as man, has the same right as man to intellectual culture 
and development." It may indeed be said for woman as 
for all other students, that the assumption that she has 
a special mission and that the teacher knows what it 5s, 
is the pedagogue's fallacy underlying very much unsound 
training in our day. Early education needs to be for 
life and not for specific work, the training of the whole 
individual, cosmopolitan rather than provincial, for wealth 
of life more than depth of learning. 

Thus Vassar was a pioneer in lighting up dark 
places. Its successful crusade encouraged the 
founding of Smith, Mount Holyoke, and the many 
institutions which followed. It cleared the ground 
for the woman's movement in America. 

COMEDIANS ALL. By George Jean Nathan. 
267 pages. Knopf. 

THE CHANGING DRAMA. By Archibald Hen- 
derson. 311 pages. Stewart & Kidd. 

It is the custom, when Mr. Nathan's name is 
mentioned, to raise one eyebrow in derision and 
lower the other in condemnation. The grimace 
is not entirely justified; but if Mr. Nathan objects 
to it he should mend his ways. It is largely his 
own facial contortion when turning a critical front 
toward the contemporary stage. Indeed, this latest 
book of his might not be inappropriately sub- 
titled How to be Flippant Though Serious, for it 
is a potpourri of sober judgments and irrelevant 
nonsense so compounded that the sauce, as often 
as not, conceals the stew. George Bernard Shaw 
once admonished critics to be certain of their facts 
and then say whatever they had to say as lightly 
and irreverently as possible. Mr. Nathan is usu- 
ally certain of his facts at least his theatrical 
facts; but unfortunately he has swallowed the 
Irishman's sermon whole, and in Comedians All 
he merely turns over to the public his case of in- 
digestion. That he has the health of the American 
Theatre at heart no one, except the victims of the 
diseases he diagnoses, will deny. And if he is 
more concerned with lancing sores than with ap- 
plying poultices he has at least, if he tips his 
lance with vinegar, refused to tip it with venom. 
In brief, Mr. Nathan has the courage of his male- 
dictions, but he appears to have very slight con- 
fidence in the opinions underlying them. A man 
in a hurry, he weakens his fame by feeding it 
forcibly on notoriety. A man of generally sound 
dramatic notions, a man whom Gordon Craig is

By ARTHUR WOODS 
Lieutenant-Colonel, U. S. A., and formerly Police Commissioner of New York City 

FROM THE PREFACE 

"The questions of police labor unions and strikes are much in the public mind. I 
cannot but feel that these questions would never have arisen if a better and truer 
understanding had existed between police and public if the public paid its guard- 
ians proper salaries, provided them with single-minded public servants for leaders, 
kept itself informed as to police methods and results, and adopted means to reward 
men who were rendering commendable service; and if the police had been made to 
realize that they are entrusted with the proud duty of maintaining law and order, 
that they serve the whole people regardless of sect, politics, station in life or in- 
dustry." 

This new book deals with the above questions in a clear, keen manner, illustrated by 
many incidents from the author'? wide personal experience.

THE MORAL BASIS of DEMOCRACY 

By ARTHUR TWINING HADLEY 
President of Yale University 

Out of the clash of conflicting systems of gov- 
ernment and industry, Democracy is develop- 
ing as a moral issue. President Hadley, from 
his position at the head of a great American 
university, has watched and noted the forces 
now at work in the world. His present book, 
written in the same brilliant style as his for- 
mer works, gives us the result of his analysis 
and its application to the duties and prob- 
lems of the individual man.

reported to have called "the best of all critics," 
he nevertheless so concerns himself with catching 
the popular ear that, having caught it, he has 
scarcely any time left for the delivery of his 
message. 

It is this constant desire to startle and stun, to 
blackjack his readers into acquiescence by means 
of his hold-up style rather than persuade them to 
part with their stupidity by means of his phil- 
osophy, that not only vitiates such authority as 
he might otherwise wield, but frequently betrays 
him into the hands of sheer silliness. To damn 
an author with excerpts from his work is seldom 
fair. Comedians All is not all so comic as extracts 
from the work might make it seem. Two random 
specimens of Mr. Nathan's mania to be frolicsome 
at all costs to accuracy, however, are not unfairly 
revealed in his statements that an actress weigh- 
ing one hundred and forty founds is incapable of 
portraying anything but a burlesque of love, and 
that the Germans are an unsentimental people. 
Mr. Nathan is neither fat nor German. It might 
be well for his humor, his social philosophy, and 
the stage, if he were. 

Dr. Henderson's book is broadly historical; 
Mr. Nathan's humorously local; they cannot there- 
fore be compared, much as one might be tempted 
to do so. The Changing Drama was first pub- 
lished in 1914 and Dr. Henderson makes no effort 
to deck out his former opinions with the cap and 
bells of peace; nor, in spite of numerous proph- 
ecies to the effect that the war would alter the 
artist's world as completely as the artisan's, does 
this summary of dramatic tendencies from Moliere 
to Maeterlinck lose its ante-bellum pertinence. Dr. 
Henderson pretends that he is not a Platonist. 
He calls beautifully false the poetic dictum that 

The Bust outlasts the throne 

The Coin, Tiberius. 
All passes. Art alone 

Enduring stays to us; 

and in so doing radically undermines a defence of 
such a book as his by assuming that his readers' 
interest in the older forms of drama is merely a 
speculative curiosity in tRe archaic. Fortunately 
he does not press his thesis into action, and thereby 
not only spares himself the difficulty of proving 
that Michelangelo's David, for example, is admired 
today merely as a relic of sixteenth century Italian 
art, but also delivers Jiis readers from the dilemma 
of having to choose between Shakespeare and 
Strindberg. In fact, on page 304, speaking of 
modern dramatic tendencies, he says: "To the new 
artist, pure realism is caricature. His design is 
imaginative not realistic, decorative not graphic." 
In other words, Dr. Henderson contradicts him- 
self; for the fundamental urge of all beauty, as 
he himself unconsciously demonstrates, is to lift 
itself always above the level of human existence, 
to be beautifully false to all facts. But let the 
contradiction stand. It may weaken his fame as 



a dialectician: it cannot injure his reputation as 
a .sober historian of the stage. The Changing 
Drama presents a bird's-eye panorama of three 
centuries of undulating dramatic geography. If it 
does anything else, it indirectly offers fresh proof 
that, except in matters of local topography, the 
hills of dramatic speech are changeless. 

THE Boss AND THE MACHINE. By Samuel P. 
Orth. Chronicles of America Series. 203 
pages. Yale University Press. 

This is Volume 43 of the Chronicles of Amer- 
ica series. The author describes it in his sub-title 
as A Chronicle of the Politicians and Party Organi- 
zation. It suffers from the disadvantages inevit- 
able in an attempt to detach one phase of national 
life out of a century and a half of excessively com- 
plex growth, and sinks at times almost to an anec- 
dotal level. Its neat covers enclose in convenient 
form a considerable amount of information about 
the rise of parties, the administration of President 
Grant, Tammany Hall and the lesser municipal ma- 
chines, the reform movements and the civil service. 
But the space limits appear to have resulted in a 
rather haphazard choice of material and there is a 
painful thinness in what remains. It is hard to 
imagine a reader whose purposes this essay will 
exactly meet; if one knows his American history 
fairly well he will find the little that is new to him 
scattered among connective matter that is old, and 
if he does not know his American history he will 
be confused rather than enlightened. This how- 
ever is obviously the fault of the directing editor 
of the series rather than of the author of this par- 
ticular volume. It is to be doubted if the topical 
method of writing popular history can ever be 
very successful or present true pictures. The poli- 
tical life of America has never been a thing apart. 
It has been bound up in the economic and social 
history of the country, and at any given stage is 
unintelligible without a knowledge of economic and 
social conditions. The general reader will gain 
an infinitely clearer idea of the progress of the 
United States from a series of, let us say, fifteen 
volumes, each dealing with a decade of the coun- 
try's history, than from an equal number of vol- 
umes, each of which is an attempt to skate through 
the whole period with an eye on one single phase. 
That is, it is probably better to write history for 
average people as nearly as possible in the way in 
which history presented itself to average people. 
And for average people the history of ten years is 
a history of all the events which they can remem- 
ber as having happened in ten years wars, crop 
failures, booms and depressions, elections, and so 
on. The investigator must select phases for special 
treatment, but he is rarely the man best fitted to 
write popular history.

THE FRANCE I KNOW 

By WINIFRED STEPHENS 

The author of this remarkably penetrating series of studies of French life and letters of today 
knows her France, its history, its politics, its literature, its people. 

"It is refreshing," says the New York Evening Post, "to meet with such a book . . .For the 
discussions of George Sand, Jeanne d'Arc and French education alone, the purchase of the 
book is worth while. It would be money spent in acquiring the information that builds up. 
It shows as clearly as any small book can why France is immortal." $4.00 

The Labor Situation in Great Britain and France 

Report of the Commission on Foreign Inquiry of THE NATIONAL CIVIC FEDERATION 

In the spring of 1919 the National Civic Federation sent a commission of seven members representing 
capital, labor and the general public, to investigate at first hand and report upon the labor situation 
abroad. This is their report, with their conclusions. "This volume," says the Philadelphia North Amer- 
ican, "is a notable and important contribution to the economic history of a unique period of industrial 
unrest and paralysis. . . . This body of investigators had no- prejudices nor favorites. They 
sought out every phase of opinion, turning everywhere to the most authoritative source available. . . . 
The result is a comprehensive picture, presented without bias, of the great crisis in labor affairs that 
Great Britain underwent last spring." i $2.50 

The Anatomy of Society By GILBERT CANNAN 

A brilliant and impartial criticism of the social structure of today, by the well-known English novelist. 
"He thinks that it is time for young men and women to talce stock of tradition, to keep what is good 
but to have no sentimental misgiving about getting rid of what is bad. . . . Mr. Cannan does not 
rant, and he knows just what he would like to alter. He is not satisfied with vague words, but gets 
down to fundamentals. ... He discusses nearly all the problems of deep importance that plague 
mankind, in a telling and able manner." BostonPost. $2.00 

Modern Germany By J. ELLIS BARKER 

"We are glad that a new and greatly enlarged edition should have made once more available a work 
that had extraordinary value in its earlier form and that has now been brought up to date with the 
same lucid and comprehensive accuracy. . . .Many admirable books have been written on the many 
phases of the war political, social and economic. Here we have a combination of all, one that is 
admirably balanced and that is alike retrospective and anticipatory." San Francisco Argonaut. $6.00 

Germany in Defeat: Fourth Phase By Count CHARLES DE SOUZA 

This notable study of the economic and political strategy of modern warfare as exemplified in the con- 
duct of the Great War is continued in this volume through the events immediately following the en- 
trance of Roumania. The whole series is to consist of six volumes, of which four have now been pub-

THE HISPANIC NATIONS OF THE NEW WORLD. 
By Willianr R. Shepherd. Chronicles of 
America Series. 251 pages. Yale University 
Press. 

The extent to which this volume fulfills the obli- 
gation shared with the forty-nine other volumes 
of the Chronicles of America Series of entertain- 
ing and enlightening the reader, depends upon a 
double consideration: is the reader capable of 
being amused and informed by a well-written de- 
scription of the obvious outcroppings of history? 

Back of the superficialities of history the author 
hardly attempts to go. Events are his material ; 
and in Latin America even more than elsewhere, 
the obvious is likely to be the military. From a 
narrative so largely concerned with wars and revo- 
lutions, one gets the impression that the armies 
that roamed the misty regions to the south of us 
led a kind of autonomous existence, directed by 
personal ambition or imported idealism, marching 
not "on their stomachs" but on their heads. The 
very pressure of events has forced the author to 
allot most space and emphasis to the two phe- 
nomena most common in this field of Latin Ameri- 
can history revolution and intervention. Per- 
haps even more than international wars, these char- 
acteristic developments arise out of economic and 
social conditions, which in turn are profoundly 
affected by, the physiographic and ethnographic 
background. An entertaining history of Latin 
America might well discuss the effect of the great 
mountain axis, dipping nearly into the sea at 
Panama, upon the life of the people east and west 
of this barrier; an enlightening history could 
hardly fail to assume this obligation, along with 
the lighter ones imposed by the relation of peonage 
to revolution and of foreign exploitation to inter- 
vention. 

The author does not attempt a serums handling 
of any of these problems. On the other hand he 
saves the book from being actually harmful by 
maintaining an attitude of aloofness toward big- 
stick imperialism. At best a reading of the vol- 
ume may turn attention to problems that Dr. 
Shepherd leaves not only unsolved but unstated. 
At worst the sugar-coated pill -may be swallowed 
without any effect of good or evil sort. 

THE CLEVELAND ERA. A Chronicle of the New 
Order in Politics. Chronicles of America 
Series. By Henry Jones Ford. 232 pages. 
Yale University Press. 

The present study of the Cleveland period comes 
to us from almost as veteran a hand and ripe a 
reflection as Colonel Watterson's, who recently, in 
reminiscence, adverted in more discursive mood 
to topics and persons of the same time. The por- 



trait drawn of Cleveland himself is a true one, 
but executed with a very cold hand. Whatever 
his limitations, and they were conspicuous, he 
awakens a sympathy and respect which are scarcely 
hinted at. For one thing, he never lifted his finger 
for the presidency. For another, he never posed 
as the possessor of abilities more than he had. Yet 
Professor Ford harps throughout on Cleveland's 
"low" conceptions of his office. Not pardoning him 
for being in no supreme sense a statesman, the 
author fails to perceive that he could and did make 
of himself the doughtiest checkmater of selfish 
and partisan legislation that ever vetoed a 
bad bill in the White House. His two terms 
were two long -battles with Capitol Hill, in which, 
with his lack of perspective and his deficient per- 
spicacity, he was frequently right even when he 
was not victorious. And he would defy what he 
conceived to be an evil move from his own party as 
promptly as he delivered the same treatment to the 
Republicans. No wonder that he rent his party 
and persuaded few of its opponents. His friend 
Gilder, the Century editor, observed that a "moral 
fury" worked in him. In that sense one may look 
upon him as a forerunner of Roosevelt, and as the 
first to break the succession of moral nonentities. 

THE YEARS OF THE SHADOW. By Katharine 
Tynan. 343 pages. Houghton Mifflin. 

A literary woman's memoirs of "her dear five 
hundred friends" with frequent lapses into usual- 
ness and volubility is unlikely to create a want for 
more of its kind among discerning readers. Seven 
years ago, however, just such a book won over the 
most cavilling critics and blinded them to its faulty 
loquacity by the agreeable style with which it told 
of a literary woman's youth in the Dublin of the 
so-called Celtic Renaissance. The book, the first 
of a series of three volumes, was called Twenty- 
five Years: Reminiscences, and dealt with the early 
enthusiasms of no less familiar a literary figure of 
our day than Miss Katharine Tynan, or, as some 
know her, Mrs. Hinkson. In 1916 it was followed 
by a second volume in the same informal and in- 
forming vein and introduced its readers into the 
select literary and social set of the London of 
Lionel Johnson, Francis Thompson, and the Wildes. 
This second volume, The Middle Years it was called, 
contained like the first a mine of interesting facts 
which achieved a unique unity in their relation to 
this loyal, high-souled Irish woman of letters, her 
genius for friendship with the great, and the life 
she lived in the Dublin and London of the last cen- 
tury. Comes now the third of this series of me- 
moirs, The Years of the Shadow, displaying the 
same faults and virtues of its two predecessors. It 
unfolds the tale of the Hinkson family's wanderings 
about Ireland from their return in 1912 almost 
to the end of the recent war. Her period of pleasant

exile in England enable Miss Tynan to appreciate 
the English as well as the Irish during these latter 
years when the shadow of war was darkening the 
world. With two sons fighting for England and 
her best interests on French battle fronts, as her 
recent poetry shows, Katharine Tynan kept un- 
dulled her hopes for Ireland, its divided interests, 
its ancient wrongs. And although for the literary 
the important incidents of the book are Miss Ty- 
nan's amiabilities with Ireland's poets and poli- 
ticians, the low grumbling of the common people in 
ever increasing menace cannot go unnoticed even 
by the most casual reader of this book. "A. E.,"

George Bernard Shaw, George Moore, and H. G. 
Wells flash upon our vision during minutes of

in spite of the occasional jumble of impressions 
this book of memoirs is nearer authenticity than

ORGANIZED EFFORTS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT 
OF METHODS OF ADMINISTRATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES. G. A. Weber. 391 pages. 
Appleton. 

Those who find in improved administration real 
progress in dem*cracy as well as immediate gains 
in economy and effiecicncy will turn with interest 
to this new volume on administration. Here for 
the first time is presented a comprehensive survey 
of "organized efforts for the improvement of 
methods of administration in the United States." 
The movement is new. Three-fourts of the organi- 
zations described have been created since 1910. 
And they are at once the cause and the result of 
the growing interest in administrative develop- 
ment. 

The book is designed as a work of reference, and 
to the student of specific administrative problems 
the brief description of the organization and activi- 
ties of each of these agencies there are more than 
one hundred of them and the lists of their publi- 
cations will prove invaluable. But the introduc- 
tory chapter, at least, may be read with profit by 
those with more general interests.^ The author 
here discusses the relative merits and disadvantages 
of public and private agencies, and ways of financ- 
ing the latter. He also considers methods of ap- 
proach to the task in hand. The issues are clearly 
defined. One may or may not agree with his con- 
clusion that it is better, in order to retain the 
confidence and cooperation of public officials, to 
forego public discussion of particular abuses and 
let reform come from within. But the value of 
having such questions of policy brought forward 
at this time, when these agencies are multiplying 



so rapidly and contributing so much to administra- 
tive progress, cannot be overestimated, 

A BRIEF HISTORY OF EUROPE FROM 1789 TO 
1815. By Lucius Hudson Holt and Alexander 
Wheeler Chilton. 358 pages. Macmillan. 

MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN HIS- 
TORY. By J. Salwyn Schapiro. 766 pages. 
Houghton Mifflin. 

These two books present an interesting contrast 
between old and new styles of writing history. 
Messrs. Holt and Chilton lay particular stress upon 
the brilliant military campaigns which took place 
during the period of the French Revolution and 
the Napoleonic Wars, they give a fairly adequate 
summary of the political changes between 1789 and 
1815, but they practically ignore the cultural and 
economic transformations which must be reckoned 
both among the causes and among the effects of 
the overthrow of the old regime in France. Pro-' 
fessor Schapiro employs a fundamentally different 
method. He devotes much of the space ordinarily 
assigned to battles and diplomatic intrigues to a 
survey of the industrial revolution and its direct 
heir, the modern socialist movement. His descrip- 
tion of English history during the nineteenth cen- 
tury is not a mere chronicle of the rise and fall 
of successive cabinets; it includes such subjects as 
Chartism, the Tractarian movement and the intel- 

lectual tendencies expressed in the work of various 
poets and novelists. Professor Schapiro gives a 
full and lucid exposition of the conditions in Rus- 
sia under the Romanoff dynasty which finally 
brought on the unsuccessful popular outbreak of 
1905, but he is notably less successful in his inter- 
pretation of the 1917 Revolution. His chapters on 
France give a clear, vigorous account of the strug- 
gle between the clerical and republican elements 
which went on with undiminished vehemence until 
it was supplanted by the graver cleavage along so- 
cial lines precipitated by the War. Professor 
Schapiro's work is not perfect; the author may be 
criticized, from the standpoint of proportion, for 
giving too much attention to France, England, and 
Russia and slighting'the development of Central 
Europe and Italy. Moreover, the last chapter, 
which deals with the World War, keeps disappoint- 
ingly within the conventional lines of interpreta- 
tion. But these are minor defects which cannot ob- 

' scure the essential worth and value of the history. 
Steering a middle course between the compactness 
desired by the reader and superficiality dreaded by 
the historian, Professor Shapiro's book sets a model 
for the popular history which aims to reach a large 
circle of readers. -The laymen with historical in- 
terests will rejoice at the publication of such a 
work; the historical scholar, if he is wise, will re- 
joice also.

STANDARD 

BOOKS 




Do you know that the fashion in which books are issued in this country is quite dif- 
ferent from that adopted abroad? In England and Ireland to a large extent, in 
France, Italy, Spain, Russia and in Latin- America, the best books are issued in popu- 
lar editions. Millions of books are sold in this form the best new books and the 
best works of all kinds of standard literature. Why? Because the book-buyer 
abroad has learned to prefer good paper and print AT A LOW PRICE to cheap 
make-up in a fancy binding. Think of it! You can buy the ordinary new book 
abroad for 25 to 50 cents, while in this country it costs from $1.00 to $2.00. In 
other words, you pay a tremendously disproportionate price for costly bindings. 

Books by Famous Authors Kipling, 
Gorki, Tagore, Wilde, Blasco, Ibanez, etc. 




The International Pocket Library 

is bound in the best Continental style, with 
a heavy waterproof art cover, and gives you 
the benefit of an extremely low price. For 
$2.50 you can buy 
all TEN titles of the 
first series of these 
really remarkable 
books! In any other 
form they would cost 
you $10.00 to $15.00. 
Glance at the list of titles, note the important 
introductions in many of the volumes, and 
remember that these are not cheap pamph- 
lets or novelties, but a carefully edited library 
of good literature. 

They are complete books 

They are a handy pocket size (actual size 4%x6), 
they are printed in a large, clear type on a good 
quality of book paper, and in every way are like 
expensive books, except that they are bound in 
the Continental style (little known in this coun- 
try) with a special flexible and water-proof art 
cover. They are sewed, not wired, open easily, and 
the convenient size makes reading a pleasure. 
Decorated title pages and illustrations in many of 
the volumes add to their interest and value. You 
will be delighted with them.

turn the set within ten days and get your

Books of the Fortnight 

Modern Political Tendencies, by Theodore E. Burton 
(119 pages; Princeton University Press), possibly 
sets the Stafford Little Lectures at a higher level of 
open-mindedness than was reached by such earlier 
contributors as Grover Cleveland and Elihu Root; in 
fact it is marked by that tone of restrained liberalism 
which is coming to be a mark of our more important 
bank presidents, to the great amazement and confu- 
sion, no doubt, of their editorial satellites. 

The Liberal Republican Movement, by Earle Dudley 
Ross, (267 pages; Holt), examines the attempts at 
insurgency in the Republican Party in the mid-Presi- 
dent Grant period of the Gilded Age. A book with 
the segmentary interest and the minute documentation 
of the conventional doctor's thesis. 

Industrial Mexico, 1919 Facts and Figures, by P. Har- 
vy Middleton (270 pages; Dodd, Mead), is the work 
of a member of the Foreign Department of the Guar- 
antee Trust Company of New York. The author finds 
that big business in Mexico is threatened on the one 
hand by lawless banditry, and on the other by legaliz- 
ed confiscation. He assumes that either in or out of 
Mexico a means of remedying this condition will be 
found, but he does not attempt a detailed discussion 
of the means that may be employed. His book par- 
takes rather of the nature of a Chamber of Commerce 
report on resources rich enough to tempt any risk. 

Not All the King's Horses, by George Agnew Cham- 
berlin (310 pages; Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis), re- 
Teals the cause of the Mexican upheaval the develop- 
ment, by foreign industrial enterprises, of an artisan 
class that could not be held in check as the peons 
had been; concludes that "all the king's horses" can 
not again set up a king in Mexico; and, finally, sug- 
gests that the United States in her righteous power 
might accomplish something just as satisfactory tt> 
the American settlers in the country. A woof of 
fiction, a warp of propaganda, and a former United 
States Consul General for weaver. 

Ideals of America, prepared for the City Club of Chi- 
cago 1916-1919 (324 pages; McClurg & Co., Chicago), 
is a worthy reflection of the group which stimulated 
these "analyses of the guiding motives of contemporary 
American life by leaders in various fields of thought 
and action." Among the contributors are Elsie Clews 
Parsons, Harry Allen Overstreet, and Robert Morss 
Lovett. 

County Administration, by Chester C. Maxey (203 
pages; Macmillan), uses county organization in Dela- 
ware as the basis of a detailed and constructive 
criticism of American county government. The author, 
while suggesting minor changes for immediate im- 
provement, does not hesitate to urge drastic measures 
of reorganization for the future. 

Labour in the Commonwealth: A Book for the Young- 
er Generation, by G .D. H. Cole (223 pages; Huebsch), 
discusses the place of industry in society, distinguishes 
between the Commonwealth and the State, describes 
the organization of the labor movement, examines the 



status of the middle and the ruling classes, castigates 
the cowardice of reformism, elaborates the organization 
of freedom, and returns to the idea of a Commonwealth 
which shall express and enrich the associative life 
of the men and women who compose it . 

The Builders, by Ellen Glasgow (379 pages; Doubleday, 
Page), has for its chief character a woman who always 
appears right and is always wrong, who "keeps her 
figure by climbing over every charity in town." For 
background Miss Glasgow has dragged in the war, the 
old South and the New, Reform, and other forces, of 
which it seems she understands only the externals. 
She skates brilliantly on thin ice over deep waters; 
she is a very good novelist of the third order. 

The Tower of London from Within, by Major General 
Sir George Younghusband (323 pages; Doran), is 
the product of the leisure hours of an Anglo-Indian 
officer, now Keeper of the Regalia at the Tower. Quali- 
fied neither as an archaeologist or historian, nor bril- 
liant as a gossip, the author tells the well-worn story 
of Duke William's fortress and of its many famous 
prisoners and supplies in addition a considerable 
amount of not easily accessible information about the 
rituals which surround the Crown Jewels, the Yeomen 
of the Guard, and the Knights of the Bath. 

The Loeb Classical Library is published in this coun- 
try by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Through an oversight 
the publisher's name was omitted from the notice of 
new titles in the series which appeared in this depart- 
ment in the issue of November 15. 



Contributors 

Mr. de Los Rios is one of the six Socialist 
Deputies in the Spanish Cortes, elected from 
Granada, where he is professor of sociology in 
the University. Mr. de Los Rios is editor of a 
page in El Sol, the largest newspaper in Maotid. 
His election to the Co'rtes last May was due to 
his exposure of the La Chicas, father and son, 
who were the caciques, or bosses, of Granada. The 
professor's speeches were followed by student 
riots, which the garrison tried to put down with 
bloodshed. The result was a popular uprising. 
The La Chicas took refuge in the City Hall, where 
they were beseiged for some days, finally escap- 
ing in disguise. Though they were whitewashed 
in the ministerial investigation, the people of 
Granada responded by electing Mr. c?e Los Rios 
to Parliament on the Socialist ticket. 

Silas Bent, at present an Assistant Sunday Editor 
on the New York Times, is a specialist on the 
Eastern question. He has recently contributed a 
series of articles to Asia 6n Opening China's In- 
land Empire. 

The other contributors to this issue have previ- 
ously written for THE DIAL.

Importance to Dial Readers 
THE PLOT AGAINST MEXICO 

By L. J. DEBEKKER 

AN expose of an eminent capitalist junker plot to involve us in a 
war with Mexico in the interests of American oil investments. This 
is a thorough and detailed consideration of, the whole question by a 
former confidential agent of the U. S. War Trade Board. In addition to 
a study of the political crisis and plans for its peaceful settlement, 
there are chapters on Mexican art, journalism and industry. The im- 
portance of this book at this moment need hardly be urged it tells 
the truth about various ugly facts which have been guarded and which 
the liberals of America should know at once.
