Prince Kropotkin's 
RUSSIAN LITERATURE 

TN this unusual book Prince Kropotlcin has given to the world a record of literary events 
-^ which not only tells of what has been written in Russia, but what has become of the 
writers. He discloses with forceful fidelity the rank injustices to which Russian men of 
letters have been subjected for centuries past, and the history of Russian literature is told in 
terms of exile and imprisonment and persecution and death. Writers of great prominence 
have been sent to Siberia, exiled to remote regions, burned at the stake, hanged, imprisoned, 
excommunicated — in fact, Russian writers have other questions than those of attic and 
poverty, royalties and copyright, to trouble them. 

" There are larger and more electric works on Russian literature, but none, perhaps, which so clearly 
and unmistakably denote the peculiar quality of Russian literary genius and temperament as does this brilliant 
study." — Philadelphia North American.

LIFE IN EPITOME. 

The relation of literature to life has been 
a subject of curious and inconclusive discus- 
sion in many times and lands. The Latin 
proverb said that vita sine Uteris mors est, 
thus emphasizing the grace bestowed by letters 
upon the bareness of normal existence. Turn 
the saving about and it has a more literal 
cogency; for literature without life is in very 



truth the type of all death, physical, intellect- 
ual, and moral. But the exact nature of the 
connection between life and literature has 
always set the pundits at odds, from Aristotle 
to Arnold. The katharsis doctrine of the 
Greek sage seems widely at variance with the 
criticism-of-life theory expounded by the Eng- 
lish apostle of sweetness and light, although 
the philosophical mind may, perhaps, discern in 
some such common term as * interpretation ' or 
' reproduction ' a possible synthesis of the 
opinions which, respectively, hold literature to 
be an influence acting upon life through the 
sympathetic emotions and a collection of embod- 
ied judgments upon human conduct. With 
these weighty and fundamental matters, how- 
ever, it is not our present purpose to deal, but 
merely to speak of the single aspect of the sub- 
ject which may be called the epitomizing 
quality of literature — its power to present, with 
pith and penetration, some human situation, or 
attitude, or problem, and to present it so typi- 
cally that it may serve as a finger-post for tiie 
future no less than as a commentary upon the 
past. 

Our meaning may be illustrated by a refer- 
ence to one of the critical periods of American 
history. When, at the close of 1860, just after 
the election of Abraham Lincoln, President 
Buchanan sent his last message to Congress, 
he had to confront the great question of the 
impending secession. The substance of the 
message was to the effect that the Southern 
States ought not to withdraw from the Union, 
but if they should be so ill-advised, there was 
nothing for it but to let them go, and wash 
our hands of the whole proceeding. We do not 
know that anyone at the time pointed out the 
Shakespearean parallel to the case, but we have 
only to open our *Much Ado About N'othing' 
to discover how perfect it was. 

Dogberry. This is your charge; you shall appre- 
hend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stan^ 
in the prince's name. 

Watchman. How, if he will not stand? 

Dogberry. Why then, take no note of him, but 
let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch 
together, and thank God you are rid of a knave. 



THE DIAI. 



[July 1, 



Verges. If he will not stand when he is bidden, 
he is none of the prince's subjects. 

Dogberry. True, and they are to meddle with 
none but the prince's subjects. 

When was ever a historical sifuation more 
typically prefigured by a poet? 

Eeeent French history, as illustrated by the 
affaire Dreyfus, may afford us another striking 
example. We all remember about the famous 
bordereau, and about the kind of evidence by 
which its authorship was sought to be proved. 
Now this situation was anticipated in truly 
marvellous fashion when ' Lewis Carroll ' 
described the trial of the Knave of Hearts. 

"There's more evidence to come yet, please your 
Majesty," said the White Eabbit, jumping up in 
a great hurry: "this paper has just been picked 
up." 

"What's in it?" said the Queen. 

"I haven't opened it yet," said the White Rab- 
bit, "but it seems to be a letter, written by the 
prisoner to — to somebody." 

"It must have been that," said the King, "un- 
less it was written to nobody, which isn't usual 
you know." 

"Who is it directed to?" said one of the jury- 
men. 

"It isn't directed at all," said the White Eab- 
bit, "in fact, there's nothing written on the out- 
side." He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and 
added: "It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of 
verses. ' ' 

"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked 
another of the jurymen. 

"No, they're not," said the White Eabbit, "and 
that's the queerest thing about it." (The jury all 
looked puzzled.) 

"He must have imitated somebody else's hand," 
said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) 

"Please, your Majesty," said the Knave, "I 
didn't write it, and they can't prove that I did: 
there's no name signed at the end." 

"If you didn't sign it," said the King, "that 
only makes the matter worse. You must have meant 
some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name 
like an honest man." 

There was a general clapping of hands at this; 
it was the first really clever thing the King had 
said that day. 

"That proves his guilt, of course," said the 
Queen. 

Beading the account of this episode, again 
we ask: When was an actual human problem 
ever more exactly foreseen, and when was ever 
the bias with which men approach a matter 
which engages their passions rather than 
their reasoning powers more delightfully satir- 
ized? Far apart as * Much Ado About ISToth- 
ing' and * Alice in Wonderland' stand in the 
scale of literary values, they at least have in 



common the epitomizing quality to which we 
are now calling attention. 

There are many people* young people in par- 
ticular, who with the best will in the world 
cannot understand why it is that men make 
such a fuss about literature, and who are hon- 
estly puzzled by the praises bestowed upon the 
great literary artists. They would like to join 
in sympathetic appreciation of the masters, and 
they have an abundant store of gratitude and 
reverence to lavish upon objects that approve 
themselves as worthy ; but just what there is in 
Shakespeare and Wordsworth and Tennyson to 
call for sudi seeming extravagance of eulogy 
remains a dark mystery. Such people are apt, 
in their moments of revolt, to set it all down to 
a sort of critical conspiracy, and to consider 
those who voice the conventional literary esti- 
mates as chargeable with an irritating kind of 
hypocrisy. They cannot see for the life of 
them why the books of the hour, with their 
timeliness, their cleverness, their sentimental 
or sensational interest, should be held of no 
serious account by the real lovers of literature, 
while the dull babblers of a bygone age are 
exalted to the skies by these same devotees of 
the art of letters. 

Time alone can work the cure of this dis- 
order, for time brings experience, and the more 
experience men get, the nearer they approach 
in their sympathies to the great writers, whose 
greatness is based in large measure upon the 
richness of the experience that has come to them 
with their ripened years. Some young people 
never recover from the condition of open revolt 
into which they are thrown by the injudicious 
methods of our education. Literature is forced 
upon them before they are susceptible to its 
appeal, and remains ever afterward associated 
in their minds with the disagreeable tasks of 
the school room. Others gradually work them- 
selves into a sort of pretended acceptance of the 
orthodox view, and do lip-service to the ideals 
of literary art which are stamped as worthy by 
the voice of authority. Still others assume an 
attitude of proper humility in the presence of 
the great writers, admit that there must be more 
in them than is presently apparent, and honestly 
endeavor to grow into sympathy with them. 
These, and these alone of the three classes, 
have their reward in an ever-broadening under- 
standing and appreciation of the meaning of 
the masterpiece, of the significance of its essen- 
tial message to the soul of man. 

Yet even these, unless they are exceptionally

endowed with sensitiveness to the artistic 
impression, may never penetrate into the arena 
of the aesthetic mystery. They may never 
come to know, as an intimate ecstasy rather 
than as a lesson learned by rote, why it is, for 
example, that 'Kubla Khan' is a shade more 
wonderful than anj-thing else in Coleridge, why 
it is that Hamlet's ' Absent thee from felicity 
awhile,' has a beauty so supreme that it is the 
crowning verse of the entire tragedy. But they 
may come to know, very sympathetically and 
completely, the significance of those phrases in 
' Hamlet ' or elsewhere, which contain the ulti- 
mate distillation of a rich experience, and to 
enter into this kind of communion with a 
great poet is no mean privilege. It is, we are 
inclined to think, the largest reward that liter- 
ature offers to the faithful many, although a 
further and finer reward awaits the few whose 
senses are rightly attuned for its reception. 

This power of exhibiting life in epitome, of 
providin^r the typical form of expression for 
its every relation, of recasting common experi- 
ence to heightened and purified effect — this is 
the power which makes literature mean so much 
to mankind, and gives it for each individual a 
meaning in proportion to the variety and depth 
of the experiences that have made up his own 
life. Frederic Myers speaks, in a beautiful 
passage, of *the mass of emotion which has 
slowly gathered round certain lines of Virgil's 
as it has round certain texts of the Bible, till 
they come to us charged with more than an indi- 
vidual passion and with a meaning wider than 
their own — with the cry of the despair of all 
generations, with the yearning of all loves 
unappeased, with the anguish of all partings, 
" beneath the pressure of separate eternities." ' 
And this, in some degree, is what must be said 
of aU the great poets, and it is the secret of 
their enduring influence. When a work of liter- 
ature has had time to acquire associations of 
this description, and has proved itself worthy 
of the accretion, its immortality is assured. The 
fashion of the world changes, the material 
works of man crumble away, and social 
arrangements feel the touch of mortality; but 
the human soul amid all these transformations 
of environing conditions, remains responsive to 
the same appeal as of old. 

' Pallas is not, Phoebus breathes no more In breathing 

brass or gold : 
Clytaemnestra towers, Cassandra wails, for ever : Time is 

bold. 
But nor heart nor hand hath he to unwrite the scriptures 

writ of old. 



Dead the great chryselephantine God, as dew last evening 

shed : 
Dust of earth or foam of ocean is the symbol of his head : 
Earth and ocean shall be shadows when Prometheus shall 

be dead.' 



THE PROBLEM OF CRITICISM. 



There is a story of a carpenter's apprentice 
who ran through the streets with his arms 
extended, crying out, ' Don't get in my way ! 
Don't get in my way ! I am carrying the meas- 
ure of a door.' The critic who is honest in his 
trade will hardly claim that his methods are 
much more exact than this. There is no metric 
system that can take the precise height and 
breadth and depth of works of genius. And 
literature and music, at least, dwell in regions 
of the fourth dimension and are floated still 
farther out of reach of measurement and com- 
parison. 

What is literature? Why do we read bools? 
The answers to the first question are as various 
as the minds that have essayed the riddle. To 
Aristotle, literature was an imitation of life. 
To Plato, it was an imitation of an imitation, 
a copy of that which itself is only a blurred 
reflection of the Divine Ideas. To Schiller, 
literature was the play impulse of mankind, 
man's spirit freeing itself in the ideal. To Eus- 
kin, literature was man's hymn of praise to Grod. 
To Matthew Arnold, it was a criticism of life. 
The trouble with all such explanations is that 
they do not explain. They are partial and 
inadequate. They do not cover the whole 
ground. We have to frame a definition of litera- 
ture which will bridge the gulf between the Iliad 
and ' The Banquet of Trimalchio,' between 
'King Lear' and 'Willie brew'd a peck o' maut' ; 
between the philosophy of Kant and the latest 
detective story. And we have to take into ac- 
count that the mortal puts on immortality when 
transformed by art. Literature may be a 
shadow, an imitation, a criticism of life. It 
may be a reflection in a mirror, but its images 
detach themselves from the glass ; they walk out 
into the world with an existence no less assured 
and certainly more lasting than the creatures of 
nfe, and they dominate the world for good or 
evil. 

Perhaps in the answer to onr second question 
we may find some solution of the first. Here, 
too. there are many guesses, but critical opinion 
may be said to arrange itself into two opposing 
camps. One clan of critics claim that iiie pur- 
pose of literature is pleasure. It awakens, they 
say, agreeable images and impulses in our 
minds, and its essence therefore is beauty. To 
the other army the end of literature is moral

[July 1, 



good. It tends, they say, to instruct, discipline, 
and exalt mankind. 

Tiie first of these explanations is plainly 
inadmissible in regard to many of the mightiest 
works of literature. These tire or shock or 
appall the average mind. The average mind 
makes indeed no effort to grapple with them, 
and if they are written to please they miss their 
object as far as the generality of readers is 
concerned. Only the most athletic students can 
cope with them. Undoubtedly when they are 
finally mastered by these, they give a glow of 
conquest and achievement, a sense of revelation. 
But this recompense deserves a higher name 
than pleasure. When the athlete, after months 
of laborious training, runs his race and falls 
fainting at the goal, his sense of triumph U 
something different from pleasure. When the 
Catholic penitent flagellates his bare back with 
a knotted whip, his sense of sin rebuked, of flesh 
mortified, is something other than pleasure. 
When the Indian sings his death song at the 
stake while the fire is licking at his limbs, his 
stern sense of joy is hardly pleasure in any ordi- 
nary meaning of the term. While we have such 
ideas as duty, honor, devotion, religious emo- 
tion, to explain the incitements of men to diffi- 
cult or heroic deeds, there is certainly no need 
to subsume all these under the inferior con- 
ception of pleasure. And all these feelings and 
many others help us on in our dealings with 
literature. The case is similar in regard to 
beauty, which many writers on SBsthetic deem 
the central or sole object of literature. We have 
the ideas of the grand, the sublime, the pathetic, 
the terrible, the grotesque, the imperfect, all of 
which enter into the productions of art. Why 
should we arrange all these conceptions, some of 
which transcend and some of whicth contradict 
the idea of beauty, under that term? Beauty, 
indeed, is only one of the elements out of whidi 
the world of art is fashioned. 

The parties of the other part, who contend for 
literature as an instrument of use and moral 
improvement, have a far better case, but even 
they do not have the whole law in their hands. 
Much admirable literature is repugnant to the 
moral sense. If we deal with books in any large 
way we must read those which contaminate the 
mind, which hurt the soul. We cannot ignore 
them and pass them by, undesr penalty of dwell- 
ing in a Fool's Paradise. We must go down 
and fight with beasts at Ephesus. Zola has his 
rights as well as St. Thomas a Kempis. Litera- 
ture is really the tree of the knowledge of good 
and evil, and the taste of it is apt to be destruc- 
tive to any paradise of innocence. It is true 
that our loss leaves us with a greater strength, 
but it is a strength of sadness rather than of 

joy- 



If we look at literature in a plain, direct way, 
we will find, I think, that it has four functions, 
four ways of serving mankind. It has the power 
to amuse, it has the power to instruct, it has 
the power to charm, and it has the power to 
exalt. Of course there is no hard and fast line 
of division between these several gifts. They 
exist side by side in the same books, and the 
greatest combine them all. 

A large half of the writings of men exists 
only to amuse. The amusement furnished is of 
all qualities. The shilling shocker, the lounge 
book for the hammock or railway journey, the 
mass of novels and short stories, give amuse- 
ment of many grades — but amuse they must. 
Story-telling, indeed, antedated writing, and it 
exists where books do not penetrate. The an- 
cient Greek or Irish bard travelled on his tales 
of wonder and adventure, and the modern after- 
dinner speaker pays for his meal by hTs witty or 
spicy anecdotes. Wherever men are gathered 
together in relaxation, over camp-fires or in 
smoking-cars, they swap stories like so many 
embryo novelists. We are eternally interested 
in our own doings, and we endure the tales of 
others for the chance of telling our own. And 
we project ourselves into the stories we read, and 
dream them over in our own person. Voyages, 
adventures, fightings, love-makings, eatings, 
treasure troves, losses, crosses, pains and gains, 
— no story can be dull for us which is crowded 
with such happenings. The characters may be 
sawdust dolls, the philosophy non-existent, the 
style that of the stone age. But if the road 
lengthens before us, the inn door invites, clowns 
crack their jokes, a dinner smokes on the table, 
swords flash, a lady's dress rustles in the back- 
ground, a bearded pirate sits on a chest, then 
ennui can claim us no more that day, — we are 
bound to be happy. The bom story-teller is a 
lucky fellow. All ears are his, and if these 
appendages become prodigiously lengthened un- 
der his treatment, it is not his fault. In the 
hands of the great novelists and dramatists the 
mere spectacle of life merges into deeper things. 
It becomes romance which intoxicates, comedy 
whose mockery makes us meditate, or tragedy 
whose sorrow shakes our souls. 

The fact that imaginative literature can in- 
struct is anathema to the average writer on aes- 
thetic. He quotes De Quincey's distinction be- 
tween the literature of knowledge and the lit- 
erature of power, and relegates all writing that 
is of use to the former category. The distinc- 
tion is a valuable one, but may be pushed too 
far. The great books of the literature of knowl- 
edge, the works of the philosophers, are full to 
the brim with ideas of power. They may be 
couched in the most abstract form, but their 
total effect is to raise in our minds images of 



1905.] 



THE DIAL 



pomp and grandeur and gloom. They picture 
forth the 'dark foundations of man's estate' and 
the arches and fabrics of glory which spnng 
therefrom. And equally the literature of power 
is instinct with knowledge. In fact, a great part 
of all we know comes from ihe works of the 
imagination we have read. The shop-girl learns 
propriety and good manners and the art of dress 
from the novels she devours. How many people 
are there who have got all their history from 
Shakespeare and Scott and Dumas! It is 
very inexact history, but more vivid, more real, 
more essentially true, than that of the chron- 
iclers. Our manners, our customs, our fads, we 
take largely from the poets and fiction writers. 
Dramas and novels have moulded the characters 
of millions. Smelling-bottles come or go in 
vogue as our favorite heroines are given to faint- 
ing fits or field sports. Virtue itself depends a 
good deal on the nod of a Lovelace or a Eoches- 
ter. Werther imparts to a whole generation a 
turn for revolution and suicide. Mankind in- 
deed is very chameleon, and changes its hues 
with great rapidity as the fiction writer dictates. 
Literature's power to charm is its most per- 
suasive, almost its most wonderful gift. Very 
often those who feel this charm the most desire 
nothing more from books. The form, the 
sound, the color of verse, the grace and glitter 
of style in prose, enchants them. They go 
about haunt^ by beautiful phrases; the spell 
of melodious words is on their Hps. They have 
drunk the wine of Circe, they live in the garden 
of Acrasia — ' seated in hearing of a hundred 
streams.' Xoble landscapes fold them round, 
the blue opens above filled with white or col- 
ored clouds, and beneath beautiftil figures rise 
from the wave with inviting arms. But per- 
sisted in too long, such delights enervate the 
mind. The man loses his wings to soar and his 
trained muscles to climb. Soon the witch of the 
place comes and dashes a few drops of water in 
his face, and he loses, too, his human form. He 
grovels at the enchantress' foot, and if a Ulys- 
ses or a Sir Guyon comes to rescue him he will 
not leave the place. The decadence of every 
literature dates from the day when it gave way 
to charm, — when it abandoned the painful ways 
of lofty thought, the stress of stormy conflict, 
and sank back to cultivate beauty and prettineas 
and peace. But within limits subject to the rule 
of the mastering spirit, charm is the most potent 
weapon in the armory of art. It attracts, al- 
lures, rewards. In the form of style it eternizes 
conceptions which wotdd be forgotten without it. 
It is nearly the whole equipment of the second 
order of creative minds. Sophocles, Menander, 
Horace, Virgil, and their compeers, are its ma- 
gicians. And its spell is even more profound in 
the pages of the greater men. 



Amusement is good, instructioia is good, 
charm is best of all; but if tnese gifts were all 
^ that literattire had to proffer, it could hardly 
justify its claim to be the gtiide and guardian 
of humanity. Taking literature in its widest 
sweep, which embraces religion and philoeophy, 
it inspires and exalts. Religion is more than lit- 
erature, but it is at least that. Philosophy is 
other than literature, but it is that also. And 
the greater works of the imaginative reason are 
so inwoven with religion and philosophy that we 
cannot separate the strands. 

Literature may do its deed of direction in 
many ways, its voice of inspiration and exalta- 
tion may ring out in many tones. It may work 
by direct ethical discourse, as in the great 
preachers and teachers and moralists. It may 
present pure and perfect ideals in dramatic or 
allegorical form, as in the poets of abstractions, 
Spenser and Schiller and Shelley. It may tear 
away the veU of sense from nature and show us 
an apparent void beyond, as do the last of 
the philoeophers, Kant and Schopenhauer. It 
may raise its voice in flat rebellion. It may 
call on us to desert the mosque for the tavern 
with Omar, or draw us to revel and defy with 
Don Juan, or urge us to curse with Cain, or 
inspire us to fight with indomitable courage 
witii Lucifer. Or, lastly, it may present us, a& 
it does by the hands of the greatest poets, with 
pictures of humaniiy and the universe, in their 
essence as they are, concentrated and made in- 
telligible. It may show us the contrast be- 
tween the greatness of man's soul and the 
brevity of Ms life, the apparent littleness of his 
fate. It may show us good and evil in their 
most tremendous realities, and leave us to make 
our choice. 

Wherever there is seriousness of purpose, 
ene^g^' of thought, vividness of form, there a 
greatness lives in literature which can inspirit 
and exalt More than anything else, humanitv 
needs the shock of great minds. It matters 
comparatively little whether it receives this 
shock from minds which communicate the 
ecstacy of joy, the rapture of holiness, the tri- 
umph of strife, or the terror of despair. All of 
these emotions are good for us. They lift and 
move and drive us out of the monotony and 
dulness and stagnation of ordinary existence. 
Cardinal Newman called Milton and Gibbon 
proud and rebellious sons of God. He meant 
that from his point of view they were doing 
God's work in an unauthorized way. Most of 
the religions and philosophies and literatures 
of the world are profoundly melancholy and 
pessimistic. But this melancholy is a miUion 
times better than smug satisfaction and acqui- 
escence with low levels of life.

A Schoolmate of Edward 

riTZGERAJLD.* 



The interest, one might almost say the 
charm, attaching to the name and personality 
of Edward FitzGerald will attract many read- 
ers, otherwise indifferent, to the collection of 
letters which Mrs. Catharine Bodham (Donne) 
Johnson has carefully edited and annotated, 
and has entitled "^ William Bodham Donne and 
his Friends;' for among these letters are forty- 
five, hitherto unpublished, from FitzGerald to 
his life-long friend Donne (or, in half a dozen 
instances, to some member of Donne's family). 
Mr. W. Aldis Wright's editions of the Fitz- 
Gerald letters contain but twenty-two ad- 
dressed to Donne, none of which are here 
republished. These new letters seem quite as 
characteristic of their writer as the twenty-two 
selected by Mr. Wright. Letters to and from 
Bernard Barton, Fanny Kemble, John M. 
Kemble, and E. C. Trench, are conspicuously 
present in the volume; but the name most 
often on the pen of all these writers is that of 
FitzGerald, to whom the index gives eigthy- 
two references, more than are entered under 
any other name, even including that of Donne 
himself. That the Woodbridge recluse shotuld 
have served thus in some sort as a conmion 
bond of sympathy to unite this amiable and 
interesting group of correspondents, increases 
our fondness for him and sets us to pondering 
anew on that mysterious something in his 
character that has taken captive the affections 
of so many and is likely to win him still other 
friends among the yet unborn. 

Of William Bodham Doaine's life-history, 
this book has little to say of a formal nature, 
that little being said chiefly in the editor's 
introduction. The main outlines of his biogra- 
phy, as elsewhere chTOnicled, can be soon 
given. The intermingling of Donne, Bodham, 
Cowper and Johnson blood in the family pedi- 
gree need not here greatly concern us. Mrs. 
Johnson speaks of the poet Cowper as Donne's 
cousin; but it was a distant oousinship, the 
poet's mother (whose maiden name was 
Donne) being great-aunt to both Donne's par- 
ents, and Donne's great-aunt, Mrs. Anne Bod- 
ham, being also cousin to the poet, while the 
whole Donne-Cowper-Johnson company trace 
their descent from William Donne, a Norfolk 
gentleman of the seventeenth century, and 
through him claim the poet Donne as their

by Catharine B. Johnson. With Sixteen Illustrations.

ancestor, but have not yet clearly proved this 
claim. Mrs. Johnson, our editor, is the daugh- 
ter of W. B. Donne's eldest son, and is related 
by a double affinity to her husband, the Eev. 
Henry Barham Johnson, both man and wife 
having Donne and Johnson blood commingled 
in their veins. But in spite of so much breed- 
ing in and in, the Donnes seem to have made 
their modest mark in very creditable fashion. 

Out own particular hero, bom in 1807, and 
thus two years older than FitzGerald, was edu- 
cated at the grammar school of Bury St. 
Edmunds, where he formed lasting friendships 
with Edward FitzGerald, James Spedding, and 
John Mitchell Kemble, and at Caius College, 
Cambridge, where he Joined with eleven others 
of future fame in founding the so-called 
Apostles' Club — properly the Cambridge Con- 
versazione Club. Conscientious scruples against 
signing the Thitry-nine Articles prevented his 
graduating. The Kemble connection doubtless 
influenced him in turning his attention to the 
drama, and opened the way to his succeeding 
J. M. Kemble as Examiner of Plays in 1857, 
a post which failing health forced him to 
resign in 1874. He had previously held the 
librariansihip of the newly established London 
Library, and had refused the editorship of the 
Edinburgh Eeview on the ground that his 
retired habits kept him uninformed as to cur- 
rent events, political and literary. A rather 
rash step, as it appears to the reader, was his 
marriage at twenty-three, with little but the 
profession of * poor gentleman ' to look to for 
support, to his kinswoman Catharine Hewitt, 
who was certainly old enough to have known 
better, being nine years her husband's senior. 
The mothers of William and Catharine were 
first cousins, and thus the family tradition of 
cousinly alliances was piously followed. By 
the generous self-denial of Donne's mother the 
young couple were established on the maternal 
estate at Mattishall, in Norfolk, and there, in 
nearly as brief space as nature allows in such 
matters, they increased their country's popu- 
lation by five, — three sons and two daughters, 
who all grew to maturity, and one of whom 
married a daughter of their father's old friend 
Kemble. Much magazine and review writing 
of the best sort stands to Donne's credit, also 
the 'Euripides' and 'Tacitus' in Lucas Col- 
lins's 'Ancient Classics for Eiiglish Eeaders,' 
the editing of several works for Weale's classi- 
cal series, many contributions to Dr. Smith's 
classical dictionaries, and other literary work 
of merit. He was a fine scholar, with a grace- 
ful gift for verse and a delicate humor. He 
died in 1883, the year preceding FitzGerald's 
death.

In oommon with so many of his friends, 
Bonne was an admirer of Fanny Kemble. 
Writing to Trench in 1829, he says of her 
*Jidiet' at Covent Grarden, that it 'creates 
snch a sensation in London that Drury Lane, 
I understand, is saved from emptiness, and 
blank cheques, by the overflow from Covent 
Garden/ He attributes her success to 'her 
ideality of impersonation/ From the many let- 
ters written to her by Donne in later life, one 
paragraph may be selected as illustrating his 
eclecticism in matters of religion. 

'Frederic Maurice has at length got some 
preferment, not much worth the having, but 
nevertheless he has passed the barrier, and prob- 
ably will rise higher ere long. He is come to a 
parish in our part of the town — and to a church 
which you may remember at the bottom of Wim- 
pole St. and at the comer of Wigmore St. We 
shall resort to him: and I shall have within a 
circle of a quarter of a mile three such pulpit 
oratoirs as content me, viz., J. J. Tayler, Mar- 
tineau, and Maurice, nor will their doctrines be 
discordant in any material respect, as without 
concert and in ostensible opposition, all three have 
weeded their doctrine of many of the incum- 
brances of the Church of England.' 

His intimacy with E. C. Trench permitted 
him to indulge in a Kttle innocent mischief 
with his serious-minded friend. When the 
future archbishop was writing his * Lessons in 
Proverbs ' he asked Donne for such specimens 
of aphoristic wisdom as he could furnish. 
' Have you this one,' asked Donne, — * No fool 
so big but there's a bigger at his funeral ? " 
'Xo,' replied the collector of old saws, and 
was proceeding to write it down when some- 
thing made him look up in time to catch a 
twinkle in his friend's eye; whereupon he 
taxed him with inventing the proverb, which 
the culprit could not deny. Soon after remor- 
ing to Bury St. Edmunds, to enter his boys 
in his old alma mater there, he wrote humor- 
ously to Trench of his somewhat chaotic con- 
dition. He says : 

'The number of Trades I have exercised in 
my own person of late astonishes me, my genius 
does not lie in history or criticism, but in uphol- 
stery and kindred manual acts. I have earned 
my bread for a month honestly, and I regard my 
month's hard-labour with some pride. I have 
one sitting-room carpeted, and a bed to lie on, 
and have had "losses go to — and wise fellow 
enough" and if I have not two gowns I have two 
gardens. Next week I must into Norfolk to pre- 
pare for my auction. It will be some time in 
September. Put money in thy purse and go to 
it. A power of books to be sold, for T have heroi- 
cally curtailed my library to my dimensions here 
and sell all that is superfluous. Just as I am in 
the midst of chaos, comes a request from my mas- 
ter, Dr. Smith, that I would write him some sixty 
Boman lives for his Dictionary, and in fact be his 
sub-editor, because forsooth he is going on his 



pleasures to Scotland. This is worshipful intelli- 
gence, but I am going to try and oblige him see- 
ing that in the end I may repay my charges in 
moving. ' 

In a letter to Bernard Barton occurs a 
reference to * E. F. G.' which will be enjoyed. 

'Can you not put a little ratsbane in E. F. Gr.'s 
toasted cheese — not enough to make it fatal, but 
merely purgative. He has used me vilely. Firsi 
he takes me to task for using long words, such as 
he says he does not understand; and then when I 
protest against being accused of affectation he 
defends himself by saying I am not so much 
affected as stupid. "Shall this fellow live?" AD 
authors are in danger from him, and should 
unite against him. And you have such an oppor- 
tunity as does not fall to every one's lot of quiet- 
ing him.' 

And now for a truly characteristic bit from 
E. F. G. himself. In the late summer of 1863, 
while enjoying his dolce far niente in his boat, 
somewhere about Lowestoft we infer, he writes 
a letter to Donne, of which the following much 
be-capitaled passage has the familiar sound 
and the familiar look. 

*I think you would like this Bawdsey (though 
the Name should hardly be mentioned to Esirs 
polite): only about a dozen Fishermen's Houses, 
■btiilt where our Eiver runs into the Sea over a 
foaming Bar: on one side of which is a good 
sand to Felixstowe and on the other an orange- 
coloured Crag Cliff towards Oxford Haven: not a 
single respectable House, or Inhabitant, or Lodger: 
no white Cravats; an Inn with scarce Table or 
Chair: and only Bread and Cheese to eat. I often 
lie there in my Boat: I wish you would come and 
do so. But now I have got my Boat back, I think 
we are in for wet weather: which we shall all be 
glad of. Capital harvests everywhere: and even 
the Green Crops much better off than I have seen 
them in much less dry Seasons. There have been 
great dews that have kept their Tails up. One 
night when I was becalmed going to Holland 
the sails reeked as after a three hours' Bain; and 
strange Fish with blue Uns came up and fol- 
lowed in such wake as the Boat made. They 
looked ghastly and haunted me in a Dream! ' 

A few sentences from a letter written by 
Fanny Kemble to Donne in 1857 show us poor 
FitzGerald playing the pathetically uncon- 
genial part of Benedick. He and Lucy Barton 
had recently entered on their short and lam- 
entable experience of married life. 

'Ed FitzGerald has taken rooms at 24 Portland 
Terrace for 3 months, much to my delight, for he 
is within reach, much to his own discomfiture, for 
the rooms it seems are dark and dismal, looking 
forward on the wild beasts [in the Zoological 
Gardens], looking backward on a cemetery. The 
paper of his sitting-room is a dark, indeed, an 
invisible green, the windows are narrow, and he 
says that "his contemporary" — which, being 
interpreted, means his wife! looks in this chamber 
of horrors like Lucrezia Borgia. Most extraordi- 
nary of Benedicks is our friend. He talks like 
Bluebeard. Speaks "O 'leaping o'er the line";

mind. I have however so much confidence in him 
that I believe all this irony with a rooted regard 
for Lucy, and so much confidence in Lucy as to 
believe she'll tame Petruchio, swagger as he list. 
Yet for the present I agree with your sister. 
^'Your account," quoth she, "of Edward FitzGer- 
ald is very droll, but not comfortable I think. At 
least if I was his wife, I should not like him 
even to play at being bored by me. I think my 
woman's feeling would revolt at that, and my 
woman's folly, at being called the 'Contempo- 
rary! ' " ' 

An anecdote illustrating Donne's extreme of 
scrupulousness in the censorship of plays is 
worth repeating. He is said never to have 
suffered the word * God ' to be uttered on the 
stage. One day a caller found him engaged 
with his children in looking over manuscripts. 
On entering the caller heard a voice say, 
* Here's another God, father ;' to which the 
answer came, * Very well, my dear, cross him 
out and put " heaven " as usual.' The follow- 
ing from a letter to Fanny Kemble, refers to 
the abdicated censorship and to another matter 
of some interest. The date is Aug. 35, 1874. 

*My abdication is not without its pleasures. 
The Queen, by the pen of her Privy-Purse-Keeper, 
Sir T. M. Biddulph, has sent me a very kind 
message of regret at my resignation and of sat- 
isfaction with my jurisdiction during my reign 
of 17 years. The Managers of Theatres are send- 
ing very kind tokens of regret and goodwill, an^l 
I am awarded for life a larger retiring pension 
than I looked for, viz., 3501. per annum. So, 
although there will be a shortening of my income, 
I need not send the hat round to my friends 
and acquaintance. 

'Early in the month I passed four more pleas- 
ant days at Warsash. I like the little (for she 
is short of stature) "American Princess" [Mrs. 
Algernon Sartoris, daughter of Gen. Grant] very 
much, and it is most pleasant to behold her 
demeanor to your sister. She (Mrs. Sartoris) has 
exercised her usual magical genius in converting 
what was an ordinary farmhouse into a most com- 
fortable and beautifully decorated abode — and a 
few fields into a most pleasant garden and 
grounds. She started with no other advantage — 
no mean one indeed — than a good supply of trees. 
The rest is the work of her own skilful hands.' 

Among the many interesting portraits con- 
tained in the volume FitzGerald's dome of 
thought rises in more than wonted majesty. 
One is glad to see Bernard Barton's honest 
face, young Richard Trench's thoughtful coun- 
tenance, and a drawing, hasty though it is, of 
John Kemble. The workmanship of both edi- 
tor and printer is good. One error, however, 
has crept into Mrs. Johnson's genealogical 
chart: she makes Donne to have been bom in 
1809 instead of 1807. Was this owing to a 
half -conscious regret that her grandfather had, 
by so narrow a margin, missed the annus mira- 

bills of birthdays ?

Problems of Ouk National, 
Administration.* 



In the preface to his work on ' The National 
Administration of the United States,' Dr. 
Fairlie calls attention to the faict that very 
little has been written on the administrative 
side of our government, though other features 
have been treated exhaustively by careful com- 
mentators. No further apology was necessary 
to justify the publication of this book. The 
intelligent layman of to-day may have a pretty 
accurate idea of the powers of Congress, and 
even of how its routine business is carried on; 
he may also know enough of the Judiciary to 
feel confident of his ability to discuss it with 
some degree of intelligence; of course he is 
familiar with the Executive, and talks readily 
of the Cabinet; but if asked to explain in 
detail the duties and methods of these oflSces, 
he probably would beat a hasty retreat. To 
supply the deficiency of such knowledge is the 
task Dr. Fairlie has undertaken. Two chap- 
ters of the book are devoted to the President, 
one to the Senate and Congress, one to the 
Cabinet and its members, one to Administra- 
tive Organization, one to each of the depart- 
ments of the Cabinet, and one to the Detached 
Bureaus. The duties of the officials in these 
departments, and their methods of performing 
them, are explained in detail. 

Naturally, the President, the chief executive 
ofi&cer, is considered first, and attention is 
given to his power of appointment and 
removal. A century 'ago there were about four 
hundred Presidential offices; to-day there are 
over six thousand, with over twelve millions 
of dollars in salaries, none of which is pro- 
tected by the Civil Service regulations, or can 
be, according to Dr. Fairlie. While the right to 
select these officers nominally belongs to the 
President, in practice the selections are virtually 
m'ade by Senators, sometimes by Representa- 
tives, — for the two- fold reason that one man 
could not be expected to look into the details 
of the qualifications of so many applicants,, 
and that the Senators wish a share in the 
National ptatronage. As a remedy for this 
evil, and as an offset to centralization in 
administration, the author suggests decentral- 
ization of administration, giving the appoint- 
ment of local officers to state governors. 
Another source of abuse, not mentioned by the 
author, is found in the power of appointing 
during a recess of the Senate, with commis- 
sions running to the close of the next session.

Through this power the Executive may keep 
in office a man not acceptable to the Senate. 
A notorious case was that of Dr. Crum, col- 
lector at Charleston, who was repeatedly ap- 
pointed after his rejection by the Senate. 

In nothing, perhaps, does the history of our 
government contrast more sharply with that 
of the European governments than in the 
powers and functions of the Executive. While 
the monarchs of Europe have been slowly los- 
ing their prerogatives through usurpations by 
the legislatures, our Executive has been 
steadily gaining ground. Though made chiefly 
responsible for the administration, in the early 
days his powers of direction were held to be 
small. Indeed, so late as 1835 a United 
States judge held that inferior officers, even 
members of the Cabinet, were bound to execute 
the duties of their offices according to their own 
judgment, not Eiccording to the direction of 
the President. But this decision had just 
been anticipated by a strong Executive, 
Andrew Jackson, who held that his own views 
of the Constitution were worth as much as 
those of the Supreme Court. In this case he 
secured obedience through the power of dis- 
missal, when his Secretary of the Treasury 
would not cease depositing the funds of the 
government with the United States Bank, 
though the matter was left to his discretion by 
law. 

The growth of the prerogative has been 
remarkable in the ordinance power. This is 
one of the residuary powers of the Crown in 
England, but here it is largely a development. 
In many cases the power is expressly conferred 
by statute; in others, says Dr. Fairlie, is is 'an 
exercise of constitutional executive powers.' 
But this power is closely related to, if not a 
part of, the legislative power, a thing which 
Congress cannot delegate. The establishment 
of a 'penal s}'stem with a code of penalties 
and a s^-stem of proceedure,' as in the regula- 
tions governing the revenue-cutter service, has 
a rather shaky basis in the oath of the Execu- 
tive to see that the laws are faithfully 
executed. It is the business of the legislature 
to provide the ways and means; if it fails to 
do this, the blame rests with it. The Presi- 
dent is authorized to send and receive ambas- 
sadors; but when two of our most highly 
esteemed Executives, ^jMadison and Monroe, 
ventured to create the office of ambassador and 
fill it during a recess of Congress, they were 
rebuked therefor, though the business was 
urgent. 

As he is to execute the laws, their first inter- 
pretation rests with the President. Jefferson, 
Jackson, and Lincoln claimed powers coor- 
dinate with the judiciary in this respect, and 



refused to follow its decision in at least one 
case each. Much has been said from time to 
time about legislation by judicial interpreta- 
tion. A remarkable case of Executive legisla- 
tion may be found in the famous pension order 
of last year, which decreed that the attain- 
men of a certain age was sufficient evidence of 
disability, regardless of actual physical condi- 
tion, to entitle soldiers to pensions. 

The second chapter, on ' The Executive,' is 
devoted mainly to Foreign Relations and Mili- 
tary Powers. Perhaps it is in the latter that 
the prerogative has seen its freest development. 
Just here Dr. Fairlie's treatment is not alto- 
gether satisfacton'. He correctly says that it 
is difficult to draw a line of demarcation 
between the authority of Congress and that of 
the President, but indicates that Congress 
regulates matters of permanent importance, 
while the President determines those cif a tem- 
porary nature. It may be questioned, how- 
ever, if the President is thus limited in prac- 
tice. President Lincoln once increased the 
standing army, though this is a precedent not 
likely to be followed, even under like neces- 
sity. But he prescribed ' Instructions for the 
Government of the Armies in the Field ' which 
are still used, though they appear to fall 
within the power of Congress to ' make rules 
for the government of the land and naval 
forces.' 

The power of the President as a military 
governor, exercised through the War Depart- 
ment, over conquered territory, are well set 
forth in a few sentences. The Insular Cases 
are cited to show that, after the cessation of 
hostilities, neither he nor his subordinates can 
impose duties on goods passing between the 
United States and ceded territory. The public 
has accepted this as law, and now would like 
to know by what authority the Secretarj- of 
the Navy imposes duties on goods imported 
into Tutuila, Samoa, from the United States, 
and admits goods there from foreign coimtries 
under laws not prescribed by Congress, while 
the Secretary of the Treasury admits goods 
which have paid these duties in Samoa to the 
United States free of duty. Perhaps the 
power to suspend and amend state laws and to 
disperse a state legislature, not mentioned in 
this book, is not recognized as legitimate, but 
it was exercised by President Lincoln in Mary- 
land and Delaware. 

Dr. Fairlie finds only two remedies against 
the action of the President — impeachment, 
and the refusal of the courts to execute uncon- 
stitutional orders. The statement that ' when 
the writ of habeas corpus was opposed by the 
orders of the President, the court declined to 
take further action,' is misleading. What

Chief Justice Taney actually did was to file 
his opinion and confess himself helpless before 
the superior military power. 

The ' varied industries ' of the Treasury 
Department are set forth in detail. While the 
collection and disbursement of the revenue is 
its main business, it performs many other 
duties, some of which — such as the life-sav- 
ing and public-health service, and the super- 
vision of the Bureau of Printing and Engrav- 
ing — would seem to belong more appropri- 
ately elsewhere. The pages devoted to the 
Currency and Banking are not altogether satis- 
factory, for after reading them one still carries 
with him a somewhat hazy notion of the sub- 
ject. However, an exposition which would 
really clarify it hardly falls within the prov- 
ince of the author, so far as he is concerned 
merely with administration. 

The book is written in a readable style, 
which is all that may be fairly expected of one 
which simply attempts to set forth the details 
of administrative work as they actually exist, 
with a minimum of criticism and suggestion. 
For the most part it is easily understood; but 
after repeated readings, one paragraph, that 
on the Collection of Internal Revenue (p. 
110), still remains more or less incomprehen-

A Seventeenth-Century IjUcian.* 

Mr. Thwaitee has undertaken a prolonged 
service for which all students of the pioneer 
days in America must thank him devoutly. 
Following in the trail opened a few years 
ago by Professor Coues, in the publication of 
the Journals of Pike and of Henry, he has 
now given us the fourth installment of his 
reprints of early travellers, in addition to the 
magnificent series of ' Jesuit Relations ' which 
will keep his memory green in all the large 
libraries of the land. To the unimpeachable 
records of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, 
made by the leaders and by Gass, and the 
narrative of the mendacious Hennepin, he 
now adds, in the same beautiful typography, 
the more entertaining narrative made by the 
philosophical Gascon, Lahontan. The original 
work was published in French and English 
editions in the same year, 1703, as Mr. 
Thwaites says, ' avowedly as a last resource on 
the part of the bankrupt fugitive.' More than 
a dozen editions, mostly French, followed to

Lahontan. Reprinted from the English edition of 1703,

cago : A. C. McClurg & Co. 



1741, since which time no complete reprint 
has appeared until now. Yet the work, for its 
manner as fully as for its contents, is well 
worthy of a modern revival. 

Louis-Armond, le Baron de Lahontan et 
Hesteohe, was a native of Beam, and was born 
on the French slopes of the Pyrenees. Inherit- 
ing a dilapidated estate, he sought his for- 
tunes in the ' marine corps ' — that portion of 
the army entrusted with the care of the colo- 
nies; and in 1883, at seventeen years of age, 
he began his wandering career in Xew France. 
For ten years he lived the adventurous life of 
a soldier, a courier, and an explorer, and saw 
the new world of France from Quebec to the 
sources of the Mississippi, and back again to 
1^ ewfoundland. In an evil hour, in 1793, he 
was driven by the persecutions of his superior 
officer to fly from his post; and from that 
hour to his death, in 1715, he was a man with- 
out a country, although probably not in 
penury, owing to the popularity of his remark- 
able book. Those were the days to which Mr. 
Austin Dobson assigns a court-life where 

' All went naked save the truth,' 

and to such a jaded and satiated public a 
book like Lahontan's was a godsend. As Mr. 
Thwaites observes: 

'Lahontan recounted not only Ma own adven- 
tures and the important events that occurred 
beneath his eyes in the mueh-talked-of region of 
New France, but drew a picture of the simple 
delights of life in the wilderness more graphic 
than had yet been presented to the European 
world. In the pages of Lahontan the child of 
nature was depicted as a creature of rare beauty 
of form, a rational being thinking deep thoughts 
on great subjects, but freed from the trammels 
and frets of civilization, bound by none of its 
restrictions, obedient only to the will and caprice 
of his own nature. In this American Arcady 
were no courts, laws, police, ministers of state, or 
other hampering paraphernalia of government; 
each man was a law unto himself, and did what 
seemed good in his own eyes. Here were no 
monks and priests, with their strictures and ascet- 
icisms, but a natural, sweetly reasonable religion. 
Here no vulgar love of money pursued the peace- 
ful native in his leafy home; without distinction 
of property, the rich man was he who might give 
most generously. Aboriginal marriage was no fet- 
tering life-covenant, but an arrangement pleasing 
the convenience of the contracting parties. Man, 
innocent and unadorned, passed his life in the 
pleasures of the chase, warring only in the cause 
of the nation, scorning the supposititious benefits 
of civilization, and free from its diseases, misery, 
sycophancy, and oppression. In short, the Ameri- 
can wilderness was the seat of serenity and noble 
philosophy. ' 

One is tempted to quote at length from Mr. 
Thwaites's most admirable essay, in which he 
sums up the philosophy of this caustic and 
embittered son of the south; for it were idle 
to attempt to re-state what he has stated, once

for all, in beautifully fit and appreciative lan- 
guage. Again he says: 

'During his protracted sea- voyages, unending days 
in wilderness garrisons, and long months of cam- 
paigning in gloomy forests, Lahontan brooded 
upon the blemishes of civilization, contrasting it 
caustically with the simplicity of barbarism, and 
erecting an ideal system of savage perfection, 
which he used as a whip to lash the vices of his 
time. With the European passion for money, he 
compares the communal life of the North Ajneri- 
can aborigine, who seeks to satisfy only his 
immediate needs, and shares his possessions with 
whoever needs them: over against the servile 
caste spirit of the courtier, he places the proud 
independence of each Indian warrior: with the 
rigid bonds of the married state, he contrasts the 
easy libertinism of the barbarian: with the elab- 
orate ritual and dogmas of the church, the primi- 
tive native myths of the sons of the forest. The 
comforts and luxuries of civilization are ridi- 
culed, while the hardships and paucity of wilder- 
ness life are minimized. In short — to quote the 
words of his marvellous Huronian, Adario, "The 
Great Spirit has vouchsafed us an honest mould, 
while wickedness nestles in yours: and that he 
sends you into our country in order to have an 
opportunity of correcting your Faults, and fol- 
lowing our Example." ' 

As one reads, he recognizes on the one hand 
the scoffing satire of that famous Latin-writer 
who was Lahontan's favorite, Lucian; and on 
the other he sees by anticipation the dreams 
for society of the Encyclopaedists and of the 
'Contrat Social.' He realizes, amid all the 
bitterness and scurrillity the soul of a man 
who, in the heart of the great solitudes or in 
the companionship of the individualized sav- 
age, gets nearer to nature's God, and to the 
true worth of life and service. There is a tonic 
inspiration about it which is akin to that which 
to-day stirs us in the aspiration and achieve- 
ment of that newest race in the far East which 
is holding every gaze. John J. Halsey. 



The City Made BEAurrFUE.* 

During the past decade there has been a 
constantly increasing interest in ]Municipal 
Art, which has culminated in definite accom- 
plishment of no mean proportions. Still, there 
has been no great popular demand or move- 
ment, and the recognition of the great impor- 
tance of Civic Art to a communitv is as yet 
confined to a comparatively small number of 
earnest individuals who believe that utility can 
be greatly aided by good taste. The founda- 
tion of our government is too solid, and its 
future in the world too permanent, for us 
longer to build merely for the moment, with

utter disregard of appearances and immediate 
surroundings. A discriminating observer can 
hardly fail to be deeply impressed with the 
inoongruity of all that man has added to the 
surface of the earth. He has outraged natural 
beauties with such atrocious habitations and 
monuments that he has actually created a taste 
among the masses for the ugly and inhar- 
monious. Many attractive regions have been 
artistically and picturesquely ruined by his 
insistent and overbearing personality expressed 
in suppositious architectural forms. He has 
imposed upon us by the glitter of gold, and 
blinded our eyes by quantity rather than 
qijaUty. Frankly, he has given us that which 
we could appreciate most for the time being; 
but we are at last awakening to the fact that 
this gold is not without alloy. The blinding 
glitter is not now enough to hide its ugly 
shape, and we hope and pray that he will soon 
begin to express himself in forms of sjTnmetry 
and stateliness. He has scarred the face of the 
country, and done his deadly work in raising 
false standards; but it is not yet too late for 
him to turn and express himself, where the 
community is concerned, in artistic terms with 
a harmonious environment. It is essential that 
he should not be indifferent, but should lead 
in the right education of the people. And this 
is the crux of the Municipal Art situation: the 
awakening of an unenlightened public, first 
to the knowledge of what civic beauty means, 
and second to the possibility of attaining it. 

That the great masses are steeped in igno- 
rance of its meaning, and that a large majority 
of the wealthy are coldly indifferent to its 
attainment, are two facts that are constantly 
impressed upon those who have had anything 
to do with Civic Art. The best ways of edu- 
cating the one and overcoming the oftimes 
hostile indifference of the other have been 
among the serious questions considered by 
Municipal Art Societies. Plans that required 
the backing of the city, the state, and some- 
times the nation, have had to be abandoned, 
and effort has been resolved into one idea, 
which has finally become paramount, that of 
education. It is really an education of the 
eye, by examples of what has already been done 
in a simple way in this country, and also by 
showing how much the rest of the world has 
accomplished. 

Among the practical aids which this move- 
ment has received, two books by Mr. Charles 
Mulford Eobinson must be given a prominent 
place. Of one of these books, * Modem Civic 
Art, or the City Made Beautiful/ a new edi- 
tion has appeared, delightfully illustrated with 
views of places noted for their interest and 
beauty. In the preface to this edition. Mr.

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



Eobinson says that nothing has been more 
remarkable than the growth of the civic im- 
provement movement during the last few years. 
Upwards of twelve hundred societies are now 
recorded, and the interchange of experiences 
and methods is of the greatest value. These clubs 
come in contact with each other through 
national organizations. He also thinks, so 
valuable are the suggestions that can be 
exchanged, that it is possible to have a litera- 
ture of the subject that would be international. 

It has been felt that a general awakening to 
the benefits of Municipal Art vfould at no dis- 
tant date result in a demand for its considera- 
tion upon all suitable occasions. Its advocates 
have therefore been interested in methods of 
reaching the greatest number of people, and have 
eoncludied that the direct appeal to the eye is far 
superior to all others. No more important 
educational example was ever placed before 
Americans than the World's Fair of 1903 ; and 
we firmly believe that no influence has been 
more potent in awakening a taste for Civic 
Art. Not that we would wish an infinite num- 
ber of ' White Cities ' to spring up all over the 
country, but that the idea of harmony should 
enter more largely into the building of our 
towns; that the situation should conform to 
the topography of the land, and that every 
natural beauty should be preserved and en- 
hanced. Mr. Eobinson has realized this, and 
in his various chapters has taken up the possi- 
bilities of Civic Art and shown why certain 
cities are successful examples and how others 
can be made so. Civic Art is good, sound, 
practical reasoning, deduced from the experi- 
ence of the ages, and meant for the masses of 
the people. ' Loving beauty, it loves humanity 
yet better. It wants the surroundings of men 
to be clean, wholesome, and uplifting, as well 
as pleasant to see. Personified, modern Civic 
Art appears as a sort of a social reformer; for 
if the eye be that of the artist, there is surely 
yet in it the tear of the philanthropist.' 

Many people seem to think that art is some- 
thing so impracticable, so superficial, so easily 
acquired when wealth comes, that it can have 
nothing to do with the foundation of things. 
They do not require or ask the same standard 
of perfection in what their eyes rest upon as 
they do in the working of a machine. They 
are content with that which is imperfect and 
oftimes inferior on its artistic side, and only 
appreciate perfection in commercial things. 
And yet Civic Art is the best investment a 
city can make. It is the life of many cities of 
the Old World, and means millions of dollars 
to foreign nations. It creates pride in its citi- 
zens more than any other thing can, and holds 
their allegiance and love. 



Municipal art is for all the people. ' If 
men seek it they seek it not for art's sake, but 
for the city's. They are not asking the town 
to help art, but art to help the town: the 
artists, not to glorify their art, but their art to 
glorify the city.' Ealph Clarkson. 



Briefs on J^eav Books. 



Color-prints As appreciation of the color-prints 
by masters of designed by the Masters of the 
Japanese art. Popular School of Japanese Art 
broadens, the literature of the subject increases. 
From San Francisco (Paul Elder & Co.) comes 
Miss Dora Amsden's 'Impressions of Ukiyo-ye,' 
daintily printed on Japanese paper, and bound 
in Japanese style, though more substantially, as 
is suited to our rougher way of handling books. 
The author frankly disavows the work as an 'in- 
dividual expression.' Her endeavor, she ex- 
plains, is * to give in condensed form the opinions 
of those qualified by study and research to speak 
with authority upon the form of Japanese art, 
which in its most concrete development, the 
Ukiyo-ye print, is now claiming the attention of 
the art world.' Were the views reflected only 
those of writers thus qualified, the book would 
have greater value. But from Fenollosa to Hart- 
mann is a far cry. And in imagination alone 
can warrant be foimd for such extravagant state- 
ments as that ' To Ukiyo-ye the Japanese owed 
the gradual expansion of international conscious- 
ness which culminated in the revolution of 1868, 
—a revolution, the most astonishing in history, 
accomplished as if by miracle; but the esoteric 
germ of this seemingly spontaneous growth of 
Meiji lay in the atelier of the artists of Ukiyo-ye.' 
Interesting, indeed, were it true! Equally beside 
the mark are the assertions that 'Japanese Art 
was ever dominated by the priestly hierarchy,' 
and that, before the advent of Ukiyo-ye, 'the 
aristocratic schools had confined themselves en- 
tirely to representations of princely pageantry, to 
portraiture, and to ideal pictures of mythical per- 
sonages, saints, and sages. ' Has the author never 
heard of the landscapes of Sesshu, Shubun, So- 
ami, and Motonobu, or of the birds of Chokuan 
and Utanosuke, or of the flowers of Korin and 
Kenzan,— to name a few only out of the host of 
artists who painted these subjects'? And where 
did she get the notion that the 'national stage 
passion' of the Japanese 'overshadows the love 
of any other amusement,' or that 'it was to the 
persons of the actors, and the printers who 
spread their pictures broadcast, that the people 
owed the aesthetic wonders of their costume ? ' The 
frequent occurrence of such misstatements as 
these mar what would otherwise be a very accept-

er and proof-reader; but not so such expressions 
as Tanyu of Kano and Shunsho of Katsukawa. 
Though intended in the sense in which we speak 
of Raphael of Urbino. they are in fact the equiva- 
lent of, let us for example say, Albrecht of Diirer, 
or Theodore of Roosevelt. Kano and Katsukawa 
are not merely the designations of schools; they 
are the surnames of the artists comprising these 
schools. Kano no Tanyu would be no less absurd 
than strange to the ear of a Japanese. The chap- 
ters on Hokusai and Utamaro are easily the best 
part of the book. The chapter on * The School of 
Torii' is also excellent, though its caption is a 
misnomer, for it contains almost nothing about 
its nominal subject. 

Second volume Mr. Paxil Elmer More's second se- 
of ' sheiburne ries of 'Shelbume Essays' (Put- 
Bnays.' nam) maintains the high character 

of the first. Eleven papers are here brought to- 
gether,— on English sonnets (Elizabethan and 
Shakespearean), Lafcadio Heam, Hazlitt, Lamb, 
Crabbe, Meredith, Hawthorne, Kipling and Fitz- 
Gerald (in the same chapter), Delphi and Greek 
literature, and Nemesis. Most striking and orig- 
inal of all is the essay on Heam. What Mr. 
More has to say about the imion of eastern and 
western thought, both as illustrated in Hearn and 
as likely to lead to further developments, is pro- 
foundly, and, in a way not to be briefly explained, 
gruesomely su^estive. There is a decidedly ori- 
ental touch in the essayist's representation of 
love, more distinctively first love, to whose thral- 
dom the ' indwelling of the past ' gives a wonder- 
ful significance. 'We look into the eyes of love 
and it is as though, through some intense and 
sudden stimulation of vital being, we had ob- 
tained—for one supercelestial moment— the 
glimpse of a reality never before imagined, and 
never again to be revealed. There is, indeed, an 
illusion. We seem to view the divine; but this 
divine itself, whereby we are dazzled and duped, 
is a ghost. Our mortal sight pierces beyond the 
surface of the present into profundities of myri- 
ads of years,— pierces beyond the mask of life 
into the enormous night of death. For a moment 
we are made aware of a beauty and a mystery 
and a depth imutterable: then the veil falls 
again forever.' Characteristic of the writer's 
complexion of thought is his finding in Shakes- 
p)eare— the sonnets and plays taken together — 
'one of the saddest human documents ever 
penned.' Characteristic too is his regret that 
Lamb is not more often altogether serious. As 
well find fault with the violet because its odor 
is not that of the rose, or complain of Mr. More's 
style because its seriousness is unrelieved by the 
faintest touch of humor. This, as Dr. Johnson 
long ago said, is like finding fault with a man six 
feet tall because he is not two inches taller. Kip- 
ling and FitzGerald are linked together as being 
much talked about and read at the time the es- 
say was written, six years ago. Although the 
essayist speaks of 'comparing' their work, the 
two are really, and necessarily, contrasted. In 
Crabbe the writer looks in vain for that 'sense 



of infinitude' which Goethe makes the mark of 
high poetry. Crabbe certainly has his limitations. 
In his chapter on Hawthorne, Mr. More dwells 
on New England's 'brilliant flowering and quick 
decay.' Yet it might not be impossible to say a 
word in defense of present-day New England. 
The last two essays, dealing with matters of 
Greek philosophy and poetry, are admirable in 
the insight they display and in their wide and 
firm grasp of Hellenic literature. Both in his 
fine classical scholarship and in his carefully 
wrought sentences, Mr. More calls to mind the 
lamented Walter Pater, although the Oxford 
scholar's reading and literary sympathies, wide 
as they were, strike one as less comprehensive 
than Mr. More's. A cordial welcome awaits such 
further volvunes of 'Sheiburne Essays' as the 
author may see fit to publish. 



A pleasant look The ' Talks in a Library with Lau- 
of literary rence Hutton,' which Mrs. Isabel 

chit-chat. Moore has edited and the Putnams 

have put into book form, are already known in 
part to readers of periodicals. These free-and- 
easy chats form a tolerablj" full autobiography 
of the late Mr. Hutton, and are most entertaining 
reading, being also fully illustrated in a very 
attractive manner. An early paragraph excites 
one's admiration of young Hutton 's manliness 
and independence. Not to be dependent on his 
father, who, however, appears to have been a 
man of means, Laurence secured a position as er- 
rand boy, at four dollars a week, in a wholesale 
produce commission house, but still continued to 
move in polite society when off duty. He says, 
*I never felt that my overalls were very becom- 
ing, but I was never ashamed of them; and 
when a young lady, with whwn I had danced the 
varsovienne one night in Waverley Place, cut me 
dead the next day in Broad Street, because she 
saw me— in overalls— rolling a barrel of beans 
across a pair of "skidds" on to a grocer's wagon, 
I was ashamed of her!' Of the innumerable 
good things that are every day being said by 
bright people, Hutton gathered up not a few. 
For example, H. C. Bunner, viewing the monu- 
ments of the great in Westminster Abbey, re- 
marked to Hutton, 'There are three classes of 
'Englishmen whom I can endure,— the Irish, 
the Scotch, and the dead.' Of Miss Ellen Terry 
we are interested to learn that, in reply to a com- 
ment on her commanding height as seen on the 
stage, she explained that she was five feet seven, 
but always stood on the balls of her feet, and 
sometimes on tiptoe. With a natural fellow- 
feeling, Hutton gives a long list of distinguished 
American men of letters who were without a 
college education ; and he elsewhere says, knowing 
from experience whereof he speaks, that 'he is a 
lucky workingman of letters who can earn, read- 
ily and surely, the daily wages of a plumber's 
assistant or the gas man's apprentice.' Of the 
importance of a taking book title, we are told 
that 'a good title is so essential that men have 
been known to copyright titles and then, some 
day perhaps, to write books to fit them.' This 



18 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



must be taken as a pleasant bit of exaggeration— 
of which other examples could be quoted— inas- 
much as no title or title-page alone can be copy- 
righted, in this country and England at least. 
Three chapters are given to Mr. Button's famous 
collection of death masks, his 'scullery,' as it 
has been irreverently styled. On the whole, for 
its wealth of literary, dramatic, and miscellan- 
eous reminiscences the book is one of the best of 
its kind. The editor deserves a warm word of 
praise for her part in the work. 



A partisan The public career of Edwin M. 
biography of a Stanton was contemporary with the 
great partisan, jj^q^^ turbulent period of American 
history, and he was always in the midst of the 
strife. Called to President Buchanan's cabinet 
during the closing months of his administration, 
and again to Lincoln 's cabinet in 1862, chief pro- 
motor of 'arbitrary arrests,' prime manager of 
military drafts, and a voluntary sacrifice to Presi- 
dent Johnson in the Reconstruction contest, Stan- 
ton's activities cover nearly every aspect of the 
struggle for the presei^ation of the Union. 
' Storm-swept ' he is called in a new work entitled 
'Edwin McMasters Stanton, the Autocrat 
of Rebellion, Emancipation, and Reconstruction,' 
by Frank Abiel Flower, (Saalfield Pub. Co., 
Akron, Ohio.) This volume of nearly 500 pages 
is not so exhaustive of the public life of Stanton 
as the two volumes by Gorham ; but it gives more 
of the personal element, and, by its numerous 
interviews with Stanton's contemporaries, pre- 
sents a full portraiture which the other lacks. It 
covers also the legal life of Stanton, following him 
through the various stations in life to which he 
was called. In addition to the many original 
sources drawn upon, the author has availed him- 
self of numerous orisrinal photographs of men and 
places, which add to the educational value of the 
work. The treatment is frankly eulogistic. *He 
was always great when others were little,' says 
the author. 'The Republic is his monument; the 
Rebellion is his biography.' A prefatory schedule 
is made of twenty-nine achievements of Stanton. 
It includes most of the important events of the 
War and of Reconstruction, leaving little to 
accredit to other participants. He is given credit 
for the prodigious industrial era which made 
America what it is, for putting backbone into Lin- 
coln, for showing Butler how to capture New 
Orleans, for planning the capture of Norfolk and 
the blockade of the James river, and for creating 
the rams and mortar boats on the upper Missis- 
sippi. He conceived the Confiscation act, crowded 
Lincoln into signing the Emancipation act, armed 
the slaves of rebellious masters, rescued the starv- 
ing army of the Cumberland, saved the city of 
Washington, protected Grant from public wrath, 
prevented Lincoln and Grant from giving away 
the fruits of victory, prevented the rehabilitation 
of secession, and kept President Johnson from 
seizing' the army and bringing on another revolu- 
tion. These claims will show that the viewpoint 
of the author is that of the Radicals in Congress, 
and consequently of extreme hostility to Johnson. 



Although a less partisan view would be desired by 
the general public in these days of restored good 
feeling, undoubtedly the stand of the author is 
precisely that which Stanton would have wished 
to be taken. He was always a partisan and never 
a moderate. 

A timely and -^ committee of the Cobden Club 
forceful plea of London puts forth 'The Burden 
for Peace. of Armaments, a Plea for Re- 

trenchment,' with the imprint of Mr. Fisher 
Unwin, but otherwise anonymous, at a moment 
when the world seems to have gone mad in its 
desire to prepare for the greatest wars. The dis- 
proportion between this evil rivalry in the hearts 
of the rulers of all so-called civilized nations, 
and the little book put out in all wisdom and 
sanity as an antidote to it, is reminiscent of Wil- 
liam Lloyd Garrison's earlier attacks upon slav- 
ery, and might be considered ridiculous if one 
did not recall that noble encouragement to right- 
eous men when the mob clamors without, 'One 
with God makes a majority.' But the book under 
consideration is much more than a mere recall 
to right feeling: it is no less an appeal to com- 
mon sense. Arguing from the history of naval 
expenditures in the immediate past, it shows the 
unwisdom of doing what the American nation 
is now doing,— building numbers of battleships 
and armored cruisers, with the certainty that a 
few years will find them antiquated and ineffi- 
cient. It shows the folly of international panics, 
which are artfully used by the lovers of war for 
increasing their preparations. More particularly 
it illustrates the vicious circle in which interna- 
tional emulation is going, as in the following 
paragraph: 'In the past nine years. Great Brit- 
ain has constructed a larger tonnage of vessels 
of war than the aggregate of France, Russia, 
and Germany, in the proportion of 933,000 to 
847,000 tons, a difference of 86,000 tons or 10 
per cent; in 1904 we were constructing at the 
rate of 153,000 tons as compared with 130,000 of 
the three other Powers, an excess of 18 per cent. 
It cannot, therefore, be contended that this coun- 
try has followed the lead of other naval Powers. 
The truer statement would be that only constant 
increases of naval expenditures have been induce- 
ments to other Powers to follow our lead.' The 
book is for thinking men— and for all who make 
more than a pretense of believing in Jesus Christ 
as the Prince of Peace, The timely little volume 
is imported for the American market by A. Wes- 
sels & Co., New York. 

Main currents in The fourth volume of 'Main Cur- 
19th century rents in Nineteenth Century Litera- 
literature. ture, ' the great critical work of Dr. 

George Brandes, has for its special subject 
' Naturalism in England, ' and has now been added 
to the translation in course of publication by 
the Macmillan Co. Since the fifth volume has 
already preceded this one in publication, but one 
more remains to complete the translation of the 
entire work. The author's introduction to this 
section/ of his series runs as follows : ' It is my 
intention to trace in the poetry of England of the 



1905.] 



THE DIAL. 



19 



first decades of this century, the course of the 
strong, deep, pregnant current in the intellectual 
life of the country, which, sweeping away the 
classic forms and conventions, produces a natural- 
ism dominating the whole of literature, which from 
naturalization leads to radicalism, from revolt 
against traditional convention in literature to 
vigorous rebellion against religious and political 
reaction, and which bears in its bosom the germs 
of all the liberal ideas and emancipatory achieve- 
ments of the later periods of European civiliza- 
tion.' There needs only this statement of the 
theme, as the author conceives it, to make clear 
the fact that the task is one after his own heart, 
and that the present volimie, even more than the 
others, reflects his own positive and aggressive 
critical personality. And the volume, although 
written in 1875, is still surprisingly fresh in its 
treatment. It takes us out of the ruts into which 
our native criticism has fallen, and gives us the 
European point of view, enforced by many appo- 
site allusions from other literatures and from 
contemporary historj\ It is one of its author's 
most bnlliant performances, and we have renewed, 
in scanning this translation, much of the enthusi- 
astic interest with which we first read the volume 
nearly thirty years ago. 

Uanudi of Air. A, L. Clarke's 'Essays on In- 

rracticai dexing,' which have been running 

indexing. ^ through several numbers of 'The 
Library World ' for the past couple of years, now 
appear in separate form under the titfe 'Manual 
of Practical Indexing' (Library Supply Company, 
London), but re-cast and condensed, and with 
much additional material. Both literary and 
commercial indexing are treated, with many use- 
ful examples. About a quarter of the volume is 
devoted to the indexing of periodical literature; 
in addition to the general chapter on the indexing 
of works, special treatment is accorded to bibli- 
ography and history ; as examples of commercial 
indexing are offered price catalogues, business 
directories, and correspondence. The last part is 
devoted to 'The Mechanical Production of In- 
dexes,' and is largely a plea for the card sys- 
tem against the old-fashioned leaf system.— a 
rather unnecessary waste of thunder. An inter- 
esting appendix offers a sketch of the early his- 
tory of the card system. The book supplies a 
much-needed guide to a kind of work that still is 
characterized by much carelessness and lack of 
method. 'If only,' the author says, 'systema- 
tized methods could be brought to bear upon the 
production of such indexes, the results would be 
more uniform and less unequal in value.' 

First Free State Slightly belated in comparison with 
of Louisiana the many volumes recently appear- 
Purchase. j^g ^^ ^.jjg ix)uisiana Purchase, yet 

warranted by additional matter on a kindred sub- 
ject, is a most attractive little volume by Dr. Wil- 
liam Salter, entitled, 'Iowa, the First Free State 
in the Louisiana Purchase.' (McClurg & Co.) 
It is really a brief sketch of early Iowa history, 
treated through the various ownerships which the 
trans-Mississippi region underwent between dis- 



covery and final settlement, and closing with the 
admission of the state to the Union in 1846. The 
author has hit upon a novel field, since no one has 
hitherto written exclusively of that part of the 
Louisiana Purchase which became the State of 
Iowa. Nor has he made a mere compilation of 
statistics in the usual fashion of state histories. 
There is enough of the personality of Indian, ex- 
plorer, settler, and territorial official, to make a 
living story. A vast amount of information is 
given in this condensed and readable shape. The 
author has been identified with Iowa for nearly 
sixty years, and is qualified to speak with 
authority. But so broad is his view, that the book 
will undoubtedly prove as interesting and valuable 
to the people of all the states as to those con- 
nected with Iowa. Topics like the admission 
of Missouri as a slave state, the Black Hawk war 
and others, are of national interest. Extracts 
from relations of early voyagers and pioneers 
are interspersed with the text, giving additional 
vividness to the narrative. 



A text-book of 'Elements of Psy- 
^SSg^! chologj, ' recently added to the con- 

siderable group that reflects the 
present-day interest in the subject, brings as its 
distinctive contribution the emphasis upon the 
practical reaction which the student is induced to 
make to the principles set before him. The 
author is Professor Thomdike, of the Teachers' 
College of Columbia University, who brings to his 
task vigor and insight, as well as the practical 
temper of one engaged in training teachers. By 
the constant facing of questions and exercises, the 
student is compelled to assume an active attitude 
to the pages of his text, and to reinterpret in the 
light of experience and reflections the conclusions 
which are embodied in accepted psychological doc- 
trine. Particularly for introductory study does 
this method possess advantages, although it inevi- 
tably deprives the text of a desirable literary 
value and consistent exposition. Admitting the 
pertinence of the method (and there are doubtless 
many classes in need of this form of stimulation), 
one obtains from a survey of the pages an impres- 
sion of decided appreciation of the students' 
needs and shortcomings, and likewise of the prob- 
able success with which the work will meet the 
needs of the situation. The excellence and com- 
pleteness of the chapters on the nervous system 
deserve special commendation. The book is pub- 
lished by A. G. Seller, Xew York. 



The mine 
of Russian 
literature. 



Prince Kropotkin's work on * Rus- 
sian literature' (McClure) is based 
upon a course of lectures given by 
the author four years ago at the Lowell Institute. 
The lectures were eight in number, and the work 
is in eight corresponding chapters, eked out by 
such additional matter as was necessary to make 
the historical treatment reasonably complete. It 
is essentially a history of the modem literature, 
for only one of the chapters is devoted to a survey 
of works and writers anterior to Pushkin. Follow- 
ing the discussion of the eight writers ui>on whom 
attention is chiefly focussed, we have a chapter 



20 



THE DIAL 



[July 1 



on the drama, ajiother on the folk-novelists, and 
a final chapter on political literature and criti- 
cism. Of the great national literature which is 
thus surveyed, the author speaks as follows: 
'Russian literature is a rich mine of original 
poetic thought. It has a freshness and youthful- 
ness which is not found to the same extent in 
older literatures. It has, moreover, a sincerity 
and simplicity of expression which render it all 
the more attractive to the mind that has grown 
sick of literary artificiality. And it has this 
distinctive feature, that it brings within the 
domain of art — the poem, the novel, the drama — 
nearly all those questions, social and jwlitieal, 
which in Western Europe and America, at least 
in our present generation, are discussed chiefly 
in the political writings of the day, but seldom 
in literature.' Prince Kropotkin has given us a 
work of absorbing interest, colored, no doubt, 
by his own political philosophy, but discriminat- 
ing and profound in its judgment of aesthetic 
values. Of the English language, as his readers 
well know, he is an absolute master. 

Accustomed as we are to centre all 
''ZenpJnters. ^<>^^^ of Greek artistic activity in 

architecture and sculpture, it is 
with some surprise that we find Miss Irene Weir 
has ventured to write a book on 'The Greek 
Painters' Art' (Ginn). But, fortunately, the 
author justifies her attempt by awakening her 
readers' interest in various related subjects, such 
as Greek painting, vase painting, color as applied 
to architecture and sculpture, portrait, mosaic, 
and mural painting. Miss Weir possesses a de- 
lightful enthusiasm for the Greek painters' art, 
supported by knowledge of ancient and modern 
archaeological writings as well as a familiarity 
with art works. Of the two sources of infor- 
mation, literature and extant works, the latter 
source is far more attractive, and as the author 
says, the actual remains, such as Greek vases, 
mosaic and wall paintings, furnish us with the 
most interesting proof of the Greek painters' art. 
It is these works that Miss Weir describes mostly 
in detail. 



Notes. 



* Evidence in Athenian Courts, ' by Dr. Eobert J. 
Bonner, is a recent pamphlet from the University of 
Chieago Press. 

'Nature Study Liessons for Primary Grades,' by 
Mrs. Lida B. McMurry, is a recent school publication 
of the Macmillan Co. 

'The Art of Writing and Speaking the English 
Language,' being a 'Dictionary of Errors,' by Mr. 
Sherwin Cody, is a booklet published by the Old 
Greek Press, Chicago. 

The 'Hamlet' volume has just been issued in the 
'First Folio' edition of Shakespeare, published by 
the Messrs, Crowell. Misses Charlotte Porter and 
Helen A. Clarke are the editors of this, as of the 
preceding volumes. 

'A Middle English Eeader, ' edited by Dr. Oliver 
Farrar Emerson, has just been published by the Mac- 
millan Co. The apparatus includes a grammatical 



introduction and a glossary (both very extensive), 
besides the usual notes. The selections given are 
numerous, and are classified according to the dialects 
which they represent. 

A new edition, with additions, of Professor Kich- 
ard T. Ely's 'The Labor Movement in America,' 
comes to us from the Macmillan Co. The original 
of this work is now nearly twenty years old. 

Taine's 'Voyage aux Pyrenees,' edited by Mr. 
William Eobertson, is published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde in the 'Oxford Modem French Series' of 
texts. 

'Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know,' pub- 
lished by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co., is a selec- 
tion of the best fairy tales of all times and of all 
authors, made by Dr. Hamilton Wright Mabie, who 
also contributes an introduction. There is nothing 
to indicate the sources of the text, or even the 
authorship in such a case as that of 'The Ugly 
Duckling. ' 

'Specimens of the Elizabethan Drama,' edited by 
Professor W. H. Williams, is published by Mr. 
Henry Frowde at the Oxford Clarendon Press, It is 
a thick volume, covering the period from Lyly to 
Shirley, and supplied with many notes. Being sup- 
plementary to Lamb's 'Specimens,' it avoids the 
passages contained in that work, and also omits 
Shakespeare for obvious reasons, 

'La Critica Letteraria nel Einascimento ' (Bari: 
Laterza) is a translation of Dr. Joel E. Spingarn's 
work published some four years ago. The author 
has supplied certain corrections and additions, and 
contributes an avvertenza of several pages. The 
translation is by Dr. Antonio Fusco, and Sig. Bene- 
detto Croce, the distinguished Italian critic, prefaces 
the volume with a few pages of commentary.

The magazine is to take the form of personal 
impressions — mostly those of the editor, and 
is to be entirely written and dated from the

The editor is not attempting to do with Mount 
Tom what Thoreau did with Walden or Words- 
worth with Rydal Mount, but he confesses every 
time he looks at Mount Tom he would like to, 
and he would like to see mountains get started 
among magazines in this country — the freer, 
more open mood in writing, the general outdoor 
spirit and point of view.

A Notable Book by a Contributor to The Dial 

Hale's DRAMATISTS OF TO-DAY 

ROSTAND, SUDERMANN, HAUPTMANN, PHILLIPS, PINERO, SHAW, MAETERLINCK. An informal 
discussion of their significant work by EDWARD EVERETT HALE, JR. Gilt top, 12mo. $1.50 net. By maU, $1.62. 
Besides the papers on the dramatists mentioned, the volume contains one on " Standards of Criticism," and another 
on " Our Idea of Tragedy." A 16-page circular, with sample pages, will be sent on application. 

Dial — " Noteworthy examples of literary criticism in one of the most interesting of literary fields . . . provide a menu of the most 
interesting character. . . . Has a naivetS of style that is engaging, and he establishes confidential relations with the reader from the 
start. . . . Very definite opinions, clearly reasoned and amply fortified by example. . . . Well worth reading a second time." 

New York Evening Post — "It is not often nowadays that a theatrical book can be met with so free from gush and mere eulogy, or so 
weighted by common sense. ... An excellent chronological appendix and full index . . . uncommonly useful for reference." 

Outlook — "Always suggestive, in the last degree informal . . . modest in style and also in spirit, fresh and entertaining." 
Brooklyn Eagle — "A dramatic critic who is not just 'busting' himself with Titanic intellectualities, but who is a readable dramatic 
critic. . . . Modest and sensible, as well as acute and sound. . . . Most people will be surprised and delighted with Mr. Hale's simplicity, 
perspicuity, and ingenuousness." 

Stephenson's SHAKESPEARE'S LONDON 

By HENRY THEW STEPHENSON. Hlustrated. 12mo, $2.00 net. By maU, $2.15. 

At once a vivid portrayal and a careful and scholarly study, largely from contemporaneous sources, of the topography, 

customs, and picturesque side of Elizabethan life. There are some forty illustrations, mostly from old prints. 

The Outlook — "Deserving of high praise from two points of view — in that the study of London in Elizabeth's day has been carefully 

and accurately worked out, and in that the description is eminently readable and entertaining. . . . Notably well printed and carefully 

illustrated." 

Wallace's RUSSIA Entirely New Edition 672 pages. $5.00. Retail 

This standard work has been rewritten throughout and greatly enlarged. While preserving the historical point of 
view, it presents Russian conditions and relations in their latest phases. Since the book originally appeared, the 
author has had abundant opportunities of observing the Russian Empire, both from without and within. Not long 
ago he spent many months in Russia with the express purpose of preparing matter for this revision. Previously he 
had been for six years an official in Turkey, and for nearly five years private secretary to the Viceroy of India. He 
was also political officer attending the Czarowitch (now the Emperor Nicholas II.) during his tour in India and Ceylon. 

Jordan's GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF FISHES $12.00 net (coma^eex<ra). 

Probably the most comprehensive, authoritative, and sumptuous book on its subject. Valuable for students and interesting to anglers 
and nature lovers. There are frontispieces in colors and over 930 illustrations. 2 vols., 8vo, 1223 pages. (Thirty-two page prospectus 
sent on application.) 

Colton's BELTED SEAS $i5o. 

A fantastic tale, remarkable for humor and pathos. The Evening Pott says : " What Jacobs has done for the English seaman, Colton 
has done for the Tankee sailor." Life says the characters to whom the Captain tells his yam are "worthy of Diokeus," and the 
Cincinnati Enquirer compares the story favorably with those of Stockton and Mark Twain. 

Mrs. FraSer'S MAID OF JAPAN Decorated by bertha STUART. $1.25. 

By the author of "Letters from Japan," etc. The love story of Hime, the shell-gatherer, who was a daughter of the East and West. 
Mrs. Eraser's work has been praised by Mr. John La Farge, and is much admired by the Japanese themselves. (Just issued. ) 

Fisguill's VENUS OF CADIZ an extravaganza. $1.50. 

An original, whimsical, scintillating book, not without heart interest. The quaint characters include the unsophisticated Venus of 
Cadis (Ky.), a lovelorn six-footer, proprietor of some mushroom caves, Pap, Pup, and Pete. (Just issued.) 

Williamson's THE PRINCESS PASSES Fifth printing. $1.50. 

Sinclair's THE DIVINE FIRE Seventh printing. $1.50. 

Wilson's PEDAGOGUES AND PARENTS Second printing. $1.25 net. By mail, $1.37.

AMERICA AT OXFORD. 



The interesting erperiment, made possible 
by the testament of the late Cecil Khodes, of 
bringing a selected body of American students 
into relations with the university life of 
Oxford, has now been in operation for a year, 
and forty-three young men from this country, 
representing the same nun:iber of states and 
territories, have been enrolled during that 
period as members of the several colleges. 
From time to time we get a report from one 



or another of these young men, describing the 
conditions of his student life, and inevitably 
making comparisons of some sort with the con- 
ditions of life in the American university. 
One of the most frank and instructive of these 
reports is from Mr. Paul Nixon, the first 
Ehodes scholar from Connecticut, and it has 
recently been published in the 'Keview of 
Reviews.' Some of Mr. Nixon's observations 
are certainly of a nature to inspire reflection, 
and even to awaken in our minds grave doubts 
concerning the efl&cacy of our own educational 
methods. 

Mr, Nixon's first impression of his new 
university world was that the Oxonian spent 
most of his time in cultivating athletics and 
the social amenities, regarding his studies as 
a matter of secondary importance. Yet in 
spite of this surface indication to the con- 
tiury, the young Englishman achieved a 
scholastic standard which his American rival 
found it diflScult to equal. This paradox was 
eventually explained away by the discovery 
that the English student works harder at his 
reading during the long vacation than during 
term, and, taking the year round, has rather 
more to show for his efforts than the Ameri- 
can student, who would scoff at the idea of 
wasting his play-time in study. 

Of the general equipment which the two 
classes of students bring to their work, the 
following is said: 

* The conviction is being pungently forced upon 
us Rhodians that in many respects the amount of 
information we've assimilated is not to be com- 
pared with that of the brighter of our cousins. 
It is a fact that in general reading the more stu- 
dious Oxonian has us at his mercy; in every form 
of classical scholarship, except that of painstaking 
investigation of minute obscurities, a favorite pas- 
time in Germany and America, we are "down and 
out." ' 

In matters of art and literature, particularly, 
the difference is enormous. 

'The ordinary American collegian, maybe, has 
heard such names as Murillo and Titian. He's an 
exception if even the names come to his mind spon- 
taneously Even our college glee-club 

members are occasionally unable to tell how Mozairt 
differs from Wagner, while, so far as the majority of 
our collegians can say, Michael Angelo and Dante 
might have been compatriots, contemporaries, and 
compeers. * 

But of these subjects the young Englishman 
can speak with some degree of intelligence as 
a, matter of course, ^n knowledge of artists,

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



ancient and modern, and in appreciation of 
their productions, we American collegians, 
as a class, are immeasurably inferior to the 
Oxonians/ 

Once put this situation squarely before the 
American pedagogue, to whom machinery is 
the essential thing about education, and he 
will offer the only remedy of which his mind 
can conceive — more elementary courses in 
more subjects than ever before, and a still 
greater wasting of the educational energies. 
We have already tried the experiment with 
literature, and are raising up a generation to 
which the name of literature will evermore 
be hateful. Try it with painting and sculp- 
ture and music, and we shall achieve a similar 
result. If the English example teaches us 
anything, it is that the area covered by the 
work of the schools is not the all-important 
consideration, but rather the thoroughness 
with which the particular work is done, com- 
bined with the relegation to other times and 
places of those studies which the healthy- 
minded young person needs no artificial stimu- 
lus to pursue. 

The writer thus puts his finger upon a very 
serious fault of our educational system when 
he says: 

'Swamped by a great number of subjects, in his 
pre-collegiate days especially, such as a juvenile 
form of astronomy and geology, the American boy 
is apt to become temporarily interested in one and 
then another of these studies, and to devote his 
odd hours to out-of-school reading on his momen- 
tary hobby rather than to reading Scott, Dickens, 
or Thackeray. This is all very well if he has any 
decided taste for one or two of these subjects 
which may develope with advancing years. Such 
is often the case, to be sure, but far oftener he 
loses his puerile interest in successive ephemeral 
favorites; forgets all but the last; and, finally, 
discovers his life-work without having the knowl- 
edge of literature that attends so naturally a more 
confined field of study in which the literature of 
the ancients is the most prominent feature.' 

In the last words of this passage we find the 
secret of the Englishman's success in pro- 
ducing men of real culture under his univer- 
sity system. 

'The Englishman does not get glimmerings of 
countless subjects throughout his pre-collegiate 
days or in college. What he gets first he keeps 
getting repeated doses of, and at the completion 
of his university course in Literae Humaniores he 
is saturated with literature, philosophy, history, 
and economics, ancient and modern.' 

In no way, we believe, will the influence of 
the Ehodes foundation turn out to be farther- 
reaching than in thus providing, for an ever- 
increasing number of picked young Americans, 
this comparative object-lesson in the respective 
aims and results of the university systems of 
the two countries. 

Mr. Nixon is candid enough to admit that 



the American Ehodes scholar finds himself at 
a disadvantage all along the line. The stu- 
dent of science is in the best case, for he at 
least, in his chosen field, is able to outshine 
his English rival, although even ' among his 
scientific Oxonian acquaintances he is apt to 
be a silent partner in conversation' when 
topics related to general culture are up for 
discussion. The student of law finds himself 
in much the same position as the classical 
student, for he rarely has, what his English 
fellow-student almost invariably has, an ade- 
quate equipment in the ' combined study of 
ancient and modern history, economics, phi- 
losophy, and classical literature, which the 
additional reading of modern literature so 
readily follows.' And even as a preparation 
for intelligent citizenship the English system, 
which we so lightly stigmatize as narrow, 
approves itself by its results. A comparison 
between the university graduates who are mem- 
bers, respectively, of the House of Commons 
and the House of Eepresentatives, would not 
be at all agreeable to our national sense of 
self-esteem. The English student turns, ' quite 
as a matter of course, from Demosthenes to 
Chamberlain's latest speech, — or, rather, from 
the latter to Demosthenes, — for knowledge of 
current affairs is evidently considered to be of 
paramount importance.' The American stu- 
dent does nothing of the sort, as we know full 
well; it is even doubtful if he reads anything 
more than the headlines of the speech, by 
which we mean, of course, the analogue of the 
speech in the demagogic oratory of our own 
country. 

The comparisons made inevitable by the 
Ehodes experiment are far from flattering to 
us, but they should be salutary for correction. 
And it must be remembered that our short- 
comings are emphasized by the fact that the 
American Ehodes scholar has had from two 
to four years more training of some sort than 
the English youth with whom he is brought 
into competition. We have in the past made 
what protest we could against this perversion 
of the Ehodes trust, and that question does 
not now concern us. But the condition result- 
ing from it gives added point to any such 
exhibition as is made by Mr. Nixon's report, 
and by the other reports of similar tenor that 
have come to us since the American invasion 
of Oxford. If the English schoolboy just 
entering college is more seriously educated 
than the American student who is at least half 
way through his college work, the fact cannot 
be too widely advertised, and we cannot any 
too soon set about discovering the causes of 
the difference and seeking for the desired 
remedy.

Greek Thevkers axd Their 
Philosophy.* 



Professor Gomperz's ' Greek Thinkers ' is a 
more readable, but, except in the omission of 
philological detail, not a more superficial 
history of Greek Philosophy than the exhaust- 
ive treatise of Zeller. In a review of the first 
volume (The Dial, Aug. 16, 1901), I pointed 
out some of the author's eminent qualifications 
for his task, — his brilliant if not always pure 
style, his instinct for the vivid and character- 
istic trait, the breadth and discursive range 
of his thought and reading, his quick, some- 
times super-subtle, apprehension of modern 
analogies, and last but not least his frank 
adoption of the point of view of positive 
science. These qualities are still manifest in 
the second volume — which now appears as 
Volumes II. and III. of the English trans- 
lation, — though there is perhaps less opportu- 
nity for their display in an analytic resume 
of the Platonic dialogues than there was in the 
rapid panorama of the picturesque personalities 
of the Pre-Socratic philosophers and sophists. 

Two introductory chapters interpret the 
spirit and temper of the age as revealed in the 
Athenian drtimatists, and in the constitution 
and ideals of the democratic empire of Athens. 
In the third chapter we pass to the Life and 
Work of Socrates. Professor Gomperz's for- 
mula for ' this prodigious historical phenome- 
non ' is that he was ' a heart of mighty power 
working with all its force to keep the head 
above it cool, as a steam engine may give 
motion to a refrigerating machine.' So Emer- 
son says of Plato, * Nothing can be colder than 
his head, when the lightnings of his imagi- 
nation are playing in the sky.' These images 
point to the eternal fascination of the unex- 
ampled union in Plato and the Platonic So- 
crates of intellectual clarity with emotional 
depth and mystic fervor. There is not a 
trace of this quality in the Xenophontic So- 
crates, nor in the brief matter-of-fact allusions 
of Aristotle. We infer what Socrates must 
have been from his supreme disciple, and we 
cannot bring ourselves to think or speak of 
him except in the phrases of. those four books 
of the Platonic gospel, the Gorgias, the Apol- 
ogy, the Crito, and the Phsedo. Professor 
Gomperz is aware of all this. He knows, to 
quote Emerson once more, that ' Socrates and 
Plato are the double star which the most pow- 
erful instruments will not entirely separate.' 

•Greek Thinkers. A History of Ancient Philosophy. 
By Theodor Gomperz. Volumes II. and III. Translated 
by Laurie Magnus. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



He knows that Xenophon, writing years after 
the death of the master, puts into his mouth 
his own favorite moral commonplaces and ob- 
servations of oriental travel; and that the un- 
impeachable testimony of Aristotle is confined 
to a few points, such as the method of in- 
duction and definition, and the principle that 
to know the right is to will it. In the divin- 
atory edification of a special Socratic philo- 
sophy, he is far more sober than Zeller, not to 
speak of the fantastic h\^theses of Joel's 
* real and Xenophontic Socrates.' It would 
therefore be hypercritical to insist that the 
necessity of saying something interesting has 
led even Professor Gomperz to affirm more 
than we know. Let us rather, whatever our 
sceptical reservations, accept with thanks his 
illuminating discussion of such topics as the 
Socratic method; the true psychological sig- 
nificance of the faith that no man errs volun- 
tarily; the doctrine, perhaps more Platonic 
than Socratic, that virtue is inseparable from 
happiness; the application of the utilitarian 
test to ethical and political laws; the extent 
of Socrates' religious faith or scepticism; and 
the nature of the famous daemonion or inward 
monitor. 

The brilliant chapter on Socrates' end is a 
notable illustration of Professor Gomperz's 
purposed if not forced picturesqueness. An 
aged Athenian, who has unexpectedly met a 
foreign friend in the market-place, is made 
the dramatic mouthpiece of the sentiments of 
the dicasts who cast into the urn the coimters 
'with a thick axle through them,' The aged 
Athenian discourses most racily in tags of 
Aristophanes and Plato. .His pregnant gar- 
rulity recalls the style of the eloquent barber 
Nello, in 'Romola,' whose speeches George 
Eliot enriched with the contents of her Floren- 
tine notebooks. And it is perhaps captious to 
observe that he quotes a sentence from the 
' Republic ' of Plato written some thirty years 
later. When a German specialist sets out to 
be popular he makes not only culture but 
rhetoric * hum.' On that fine Spring morning 
(of the trial) in the year 399 B. C., we are 
told : ' The dewdrops glittered brightly as on 
other days in the cups of the Anemones; the 
violets shed their wonted fragrance.' The 
trial scene itself reminds us of Macaulajr's 
Warren Hastings : ' There might be seen the 
massive brow of Plato, — ^the elegant and fash- 
ionable Aristippus can hardly have been ab- 
sent or Antisthenes his resolute face framed in 
shaggy hair!' Excellent in its way, this is 
the Corinthian rather than the Attic maimer; 
Plato can be eloquent on occasion; but this is 
how he conveys plain matter-of-fact : * Of 
native Athenians there were, besides Apollo- 



32

dorus, Critobulus and his father Crito, Her- 
mogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, Antisthenes; 
likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, 
Menexenus, and some others; Plato, if I am 
not mistaken was ill.' 

But despite the naivete of the rhetoric, the 
chapter on the whole is the most vivid and 
entertaining presentment of the subject with 
which I am acquainted. The analysis of the 
Platonic ' Apology ' is subtle and discriminat- 
ing, and the balance of a sympathetic and im- 
partial historic criticism is applied to the 
tragic antithesis of Socrates' fidelity to his 
ideal mission and the conservative instincts 
of the Athenian dicasts. 

The larger part of these volumes is natur- 
ally devoted to Plato. Professor Gomperz 
wisely recognizes in his preface that ' the ex- 
traction of a Platonic system from the philos- 
opher's writings was an impossible task.' Ac- 
cordingly, after the usual introductory chap- 
ters on Plato's life, works, and dialectical 
method, he gives us, in place of Zeller's system- 
atic exposition, a free analysis and interpre- 
tation of the chief dialogues in the order of 
their probable composition, and, as he believes, 
of the development of Plato's thought. The 
analyses are of necessity less detailed and 
searching than those already accessible to 
English readers in the works of Grote and 
Jowett. But unlike these they are unified by 
a definite conception of the progressive evolu- 
tion and the phases of the Platonic philosophy. 
Professor Gomperz assumes that such an evo- 
lution is a priori probable, and that it has 
been in fact demonstrated by the special re- 
searches of the past twenty years. I have re- 
cently sustained the contrary thesis. Stated 
in these general terms, the question is a logom- 
achy. But to be more specific, it is quite con- 
ceivable that Plato's extant works were written 
after he had reached the age of thirty or 
thirty-five, and his thought had assumed as 
definitive a form as had that of Schopenhauer 
or Herbert Spencer at a like age. And if 
this is the case, it is also conceivable that the 
' contradictions ' which modem critics dis- 
cover in the dialogues are due quite as often 
to their own wistfulness as to Plato's ' incon- 
.stancy.' At any rate, it is a pretty question 
for debate. There is a general agreement that 
the minor dramatic pictures of Socratic con- 
versations with Athenian youths are as a 
whole early, and that the abstruse and severe 
Sophist, Statesman, and Philebus are proved 
by their style to form a later group with the 
Timaeus and the Laws. The debate has turned 
mainly (1) on the relative dates of the Ee- 
public and the other great dialogues of Plato's 
maturity; and (2) on the extent to which the 



' earlier ' dialogues display real and not merely 
dramatic immaturity of thought, or the ' lat- 
est' group of dialogues modify the doctrine 
of the Eepublic the Symposium or the Pha3do. 

The minor dialogues together with the Pro- 
tagoras are discussed under the heading ' Plato 
as an investigator of ethical concepts.' In these 
works of Plato's ' Socratic period,' Professor 
Gomperz finds no trace of the doctrine of 
metaphysical ideas or of Orphic and Pythag- 
orean influence. He judiciously admits that 
many of the apparent fallacies and failures to 
conclude are merely dramatic. But he no- 
where fairly meets the main argument for 
Plato's comparative maturity of thought even 
in these dramatic studies, namely the fact that 
the grasp of the subject exhibited in Plato's 
subtle and systematic canvassing of antithetic 
points of view is inexplicable on the hypothesis 
that he is merely fumbling and feeling his 
way. 

The arguments and the dramatic movement 
of the Protagoras and Gorgias are excellently 
set forth. The myth attributed to ProtagxDras 
is aptly characterized as a ' species of caricature 
common to Plato and Aristophanes which 
rivals or outbids the burlesqued author in his 
own peculiar excellences.' The Gorgias is 
assumed to be a reply to the attack of the 
sophist Polycrates upon the memor}' of So- 
crates, and Plato's embittered mood is explained 
by the vogue of that diatribe and the triumph 
of the party of Anytus under the leadership 
of the demagogue Agyrrhius. In his treat- 
ment of the main problem — the apparent con- 
tradiction between the utilitarian hedonism of 
the Protagoras and the eloquent denunciation 
of the ' apolaustic ' life in the Gorgias, — Pro- 
fessor Gomperz is misled by his determination 
to find ' development ' in Plato, and by his 
assumption that Plato failed to perceive flaws 
in logic that are obvious to the modem school- 
boy. Many facts are known to us which Plato 
could not know. But the first lesson for the 
interpreter to learn is that he only makes a 
spectacle of himself to Gods and men by 
apologizing for the ' immature logic ' of the 
subtlest and most consistent dialectician in 
literature. However divergent in mood and 
dramatic suggestion, the Gorgias does not, 
strictly speaking, contradict the Protagoras 
and Philebus. The sophistical refutation of 
the sophistical thesis that pleasure is unquali- 
fiedly the good is merely the starting point of 
an eloquent denunciation of the JEsthetic politi- 
cal and social ideals of the relaxed and pleas- 
ure loving democracy that had put Socrates to 
death and was now drifting towards the ship- 
wreck of Chseronea. There is no direct re- 
futation of the utilitarian doctrine that *the

good' might conceivably be calculated as the 
preponderance of pleasure over pain achieved 
by the eschewing of unwholesome or ' bad ' 
pleasures. But the hedonistic calculus drily 
described in the Protagoras is repugnant to 
Plato's feelings as it is to those of all moral- 
ists who care as much for edification as for 
analysis. He thought that there were better 
ways of expressing whatever truth may be con- 
tained in Epicurus's affirmation that the belly 
is the seat of happiness. He would probably 
have found a way to qualify or paraphrase the 
more imposing modern generalization that 
all ethical impulses are in the last resort re- 
ducible to hunger and the reproductive in- 
stinct; and he would certainly have found no 
relish in the Benthamite formula that the glee 
of the murderer is in strict logic to be set off 
pro ianto against the sufferings of his victim 
and his own dread of the gallows. The Re- 
public and the Laws accept the utilitarian 
calculus in a sense, but reverse the order, and 
proceed from virtue to happiness rather than 
from pleasure to good. To make even this 
thought prominent would mar the aesthetic 
and- moral \mity of tone of the Gorgias. But 
that some pleasures are goods is as distinctly 
recognized in Gorgias 529, as it is in the Re- 
public or Laws. Professor Gomperz's account 
of the ' sophisms,' by which it is proved that 
* pleasure is not among the number of goods,' 
will therefore produce a wrong impression 
upon the modem reader. What is disproved 
is rather that the pleasure of the moment, ir- 
respective of its quality or consequences, is the 
good, — a thesis which Callicles thereupon 
abandons with the remark that he maintained 
it only in jest. We may, if we please, cen- 
sure the dramatic episode as exaggerated and 
unfair caricature. It has no bearing on the 
qualit}^ of Plato's logic. 

The ' Idea of Good,' Professor Gomperz, like 
other modem interpreters, fails to understand, 
and dismisses with vague unmeaning phrases. 
The Idea of Good may be for theology (Jod, 
for cosmogony the principle of teleology, and 
for mysticism the beatific vision. For ethics 
and politics it is a regulative, not a substan- 
tive, concept. It is the postulate that ethical 
theory and practice ought to be consistently 
deduced from and referred to some supreme 
religious, philosophic or scientific * sanction ;' 
that all political and social reform ought to 
converge to a distinctly contemplated end; 
that statesman must possess ideals and know 
how to apply them, and that no ruler of men 
can apprehend or make rational use of ideals 
unless in addition to the discipline of affairs 
he has received the highest education in the 
culture, philosophy and science of his age. 



This, as I have elsewhere shown, is the only 
interpretation that makes sense of the Repub- 
lic. It has the further recommendation that 
it is not only true to Plato's meaning, but 
expresses an eternal truth. It will have to be 
accepted sometime. 

With Professor Gomperz's treatment of the 
more difficult metaphysical dialogue, — Par- 
menides, Theaetetus, Sophist and Statesman, — 
I feel much sympathy even when I can not 
wholly concur. His point of view is essen- 
tially that of Mill and Grote qualified by the 
German specialists' acquaintance with recent 
investigations of Platonic chronology. His 
discussion of being and not being, the one and 
the many, the whole and the part, and other 
abstract entities that weave their metaphysical 
dance through these dialogues, is conducted in 
the terminology of the associationist psychol- 
ogy, and not in that neo-Hegelian jargon 
which the associationist repudiates not because 
he cannot understand it and if need be talk 
it as weU, as the inventors, but because it is 
inherently and often intentionally equivocaL 
This is a great gain for lucidity and ration- 
ality. But every method has the defects of its 
qualities. There are certain final puzzles of 
metaphysics (or, if you please, problems of 
the relation of words to ideas) which associa- 
tionists of the school of Mill dispose of too 
easily, when they do not overlook them alto- 
gether. And when they meet them in earlier 
writers, they assume that they arise in mere 
misconceptions of elementary logical and 
psychological principles. This is often the 
case. But it is emphatically not true of Plato. 
Intelligible philosophizing on ultimates has 
never gone beyond his analysis. An absolute 
solution — the finis coniroversice is not reached, 
because no such result is possible. The puz- 
zles are, as Plato says, rfn eternal malady of 
the faculty of discourse of reason in man; and 
Plato's recognition of this is precisely the 
mark of his superiority to the copious and 
ingenious Professors of Philosophy who, in 
the fuU light of the twentieth century, are 
still endeavoring to produce substantive and 
definitive systems of metaphysics. 

To achieve such a system was not Plato's 
object. His aims, literary, polemical, satirical, 
were many. The three most prominent were 
(1) to uphold against dogmatic materialism a 
vague but never concretely superstitious, spir- 
itualistic, teleological and religious view of 
the world; (2) to show that the doctrine of 
ideas or hypostatized general notions is conve- 
nient in logic, and is no more paradoxical in 
ontology than any other metaphysics that ad- 
mits an absolute: (3) to explode all absolute 
metaphysical formulas of the fifth and fourth

centuries B.C. that stood in the way of the 
rational use of language and the development 
of a practical working logic. The dialogues in 
which these results are reached are perhaps the 
greatest triumphs of the sheer reasoning 
faculty outside of the higher mathematics and 
astronomy. They cannot be rightly inter- 
preted so long as we misconceive their aims, 
or, misconceiving them, undertake to read 
Plato lessons in elementary logic. Professor 
Gomperz's treatment of them is lucid, read- 
able, and often illuminating in respect to par- 
ticular ideas. But he has no adequate grasp of 
their drift as a whole. He finds the ultimate 
puzzles of epistemology too simple himself, 
and cannot credit Plato with the insight which 
he really possessed. Like Grote, though in a 
lesser degree, he is so afraid of the misuse of 
the Theaetetus by modern intuitionist oppo- 
nents of rationalism that he cannot do justice 
to its abiding significance as a final criticism 
of all possible absolute dogmatic materialistic 
psychologies. He is so determined to find a 
transformation of the theory of ideas in the 
later dialogues that he is blind to the plain 
fact that Plato's defense of the theory, and the 
only possible defense of it, is that it is pref- 
erable to the only alternative then proposable 
— a crude nominalism destructive of rational 
speech and logic. And though he is partly 
aware of Plato's third aim, the elimination 
of the fallacies of the ^age before logic,' he 
is unable to apply the principle consistently to 
the interpretation of the Sophist and Parme- 
nides. Had he done so, he would have per- 
ceived that the teaching of the two dialogues 
is the same^ and that it is idle to speak of a 
progress of thought from one to the other. 
The ' fallacies ' of the Parmenides are deduced 
with a symmetrical exhaustiveness impossible 
to any writer who had not completely thought 
out the function of the copula and the nature 
of negative predication as expounded in the 
Sophist. For, as Plato himself elsewhere says, 
conscious and consistent error is the sign of 
a more gracious intellectual condition than 
casual and unintentional blundering. To see 
*the want of logical training common to the 
whole age ' in the confusion of the copula * is ' 
with existence, and in ' certain illegitimate 
conversions. . . . errors of thought which 
Plato shares with Gorgias,' is to shut the door 
on rational interpretation from the start. Ille- 
gitimate conversion is clearly explained in 
the Euthyphro and the Eepublic, and the law 
of non contradiction is illustrated with the 
utmost subtlety in the Eepublic. But apart 
from this it is bidding defiance to all psycho- 
logical probability to assume that obvious dis- 
tinctions were overlooked or elementary fal- 



lacies admitted by a writer who had the men- 
tal grasp to conceive, to carry in his imaginar 
tion, to distribute dramatically to convincing 
speakers, and to combine to one far seen and 
foregone conclusion, trains of reasoning which 
the most disciplined modern minds find it dif- 
ficult to follow and, to judge by their com- 
ment, impossible to remember. Let such 
critics try to write a Socratic dialogue them- 
selves. But it is perhaps unjust to censure 
Professor Gomperz especially for misapprehen- 
sions which, if I am right, are common to the 
majority of professional and philological 
students of Plato, and have hitherto been 
repudiated if at all only by the finer in- 
tuition and in the ohiter dicta of such writers 
as Eenan, Pater and Emerson. It will be 
more fair to conclude by again emphasizing 
the superiority of Professor Gomperz's book 
as what the editor of ^The Atlantic' calls a 
'readable proposition.' It offers not merely a 
cold technical enumeration of the tenets of the 
Greek philosophers, but a broad and rational 
discussion of the permanent significance of 
each great thought as it presents itself in his- 
toric sequence. It is thus a timely protest 
against that divorce of philosophy from the 
history of philosophy which the specialism of 
our age affects, but which is fatal to the in- 
telligent study and teaching of either.

An Investigation of liYNCHiNG in the 
United States.* 



Lynch-law, as discussed in Dr. Cutler's His- 
tory of Lynching in the United States, may 
be defined as the popular administration of 
justice without the forms of law. In tracing 
the history of this peculiar practice, the writer 
goes to mediaeval Europe for a beginning, but 
soon transfers his account to colonial America. 
A lengthy chapter is given on the origin of 
the terms ' lynch ' and ' lynch-law,' from which 
we learn incidentally a good deal about the 
early history of the institution, but do not 
learn that the terms had any definite begin- 
nings. One chapter is devoted to the colonial 
and frontier period of lynching, which lasted 
to about 1830, and another to the succeeding 
thirty years when the practice underwent a 
partial change and became fixed as an Ameri- 
can habit. The author thinks that lynching is 
peculiarly an American custom, because the 
people had no long-established civil institu- 
tions, respect for which is inherited in old

countries; but here the people made their law 
and their officials, and it was quite natural for 
them to rise in their sovereign capacity and 
administer justice. The historical sketch con- 
cludes with a study of lynching during the 
Eeconstruction period following our Civil War. 
The final chapters discuss in detail the statis- 
tics of lynchings in the last twenty years, the 
various reasons given in justification of the 
practice, and the remedies proposed. In con- 
nection with the statistical studies, there are 
numerous full-page charts illustrating graphi- 
cally the percentages and proportions of lynch- 
ings according to color, crime, sex, section, 
season of the year, etc. 

It will be of interest to examine some of 
Dr. Cutler's facts and conclusions. The illit- 
eracy of a community, he says, is not an index 
to the number of lynchings in that community ; 
in proportion to black population there are 
fewer summary executions in the Black Belt 
than in other sections of the South; lynching 
for crimes against women has decreased dur- 
ing the last twenty years, while during the 
same period the illegal execution of white men 
has decreased and that of negroes has in- 
creased; lynching is becoming more and more 
cruel in its methods, and is participated in by 
a lower class of whites than formerly. Dr. 
Cutler is probably the first Xorthem writer 
who has sho^sTi an understanding of the real 
significance of the Ku Klux Movement in the 
South during the Reconstruction period. He 
recognizes the immense difficulties under which 
the South labors as a result of the changes 
consequent upon emancipation and carpet-b^g 
rule, and maintains that the South has not 
been aided in solving its problems by ignorant 
and unfriendly criticism and interference from 
the Xorth. It is worthy of remark also that 
Dr. Cutler does not describe race prejudice as 
due to slaver}-, but to verj^ human instincts 
which are not confined to the South. The 
value of slavery in rooting out and checking 
bad habits is recognized. 

In justification of * popular justice,' several 
reasons have been advanced, of which the most 
important are these : first, in a frontier coun- 
try, before civil institutions are organized, 
lynch-law is the only possible law; second, in 
the South, owing to the disordered conditions 
during the past forty years, summary punish- 
ment has been necessary for the protection of 
women and children, and to make life and 
property safe. In the opinion of Dr. Cutler, 
the frontier period is now past, and in the 
South there is no necessity for not allowing 
the law to take its course. 

Owing to the authors lack of acquaintance 
with conditions in the South, the section in 



which most of the illegal executions now occur, 
he omits to mention or fails to recognize cer- 
tain rather important aspects of the problem. 
For instance, he does not understand that, so 
far as the whites are concerned, the Black Belt 
is a thinly-settled frontier region, containing 
few whites among thousands of blacks. Here 
there is not, and for years cannot be, any real 
government. Since 1865, the negroes can be 
legally subjected to no special controL Conse- 
quently, 'popular justice,' from the white 
man's point of view, will prevail. No consid- 
eration is given to the fact that uniformly the 
sympathy of the blacks is with the negro 
criminal, making detection of crime difficult. 
The peculiar notions of equality imbibed dur- 
ing the Reconstruction period, from Northern 
politicians, teachers, and missionaries, are not 
yet eradicated, although the author thinks they 
are. It is very doubtful if, as Dr. Cutler 
argues, lynching causes an increase of negro 
crime. There is no doubt of the evil effect on 
the white lynchers, but there is reason to 
believe that lynching does not induce a desire 
in other negroes to be l}-nched. The statistics 
used are from Northern, and therefore un- 
friendly, sources, and while there is no prob- 
able doubt about the accuracy of the figures, 
so far as they go, the correctness of the classi- 
fication itself is very doubtful. If a negro is 
killed in the South, by plain murder or other- 
wise, the North calls it IjTiching. The word 

* lynch' has come to be a synonym for 

* murder,' or mistreatment of a negro. South 
as well as North, although the notion of 

* popular justice ' is frequently absent. An out- 
right murder in New York would be called a 
lynching in the South. And in connection 
with the discussion of ante-bellimi lawlessness 
in the South it may be said that * The Libera- 
tor' and other anti-slavery organs are ques- 
tionable sources of information. Lawlessness 
in other parts of the country was unnoticed, 
and the search-light of criticism was directed 
upon one section; and the habit has continued 
to this day. 

In the discussion of the various remedies 
tried or proposed for the purpose of checking 
the lynching habit, it is shown that the laws 
are not enforced which assess damages against 
counties where illegal executions occur, or 
which provide for the impeachment of officials 
who allow prisoners to be taken from them; 
Northern agitation, as a remedy has certainly 
failed, if not worse than failed; Federal legis- 
lation, the author believes, would only make 
matters worse; the 'ultimate remedy' is, he 
says, to create a strong public sentiment 
against the practice, and he believes that the 
South must solve for itself this serious prob-

lem. In view of the fact that lynchings sel- 
dom occur in illiterate communities, it is diffi- 
cult to see exactly how the education he sug- 
gests will exercise any direct influence on the 
situation; and the reference to the results to 
be expected from the work of the widely adver- 
tised ' Southern Education Board ' and ' Gen- 
eral Education Board ' shows a complete ignor- 
ance of actual conditions in Southern educa- 
tion. The real remedies, so far as the South 
is concerned, are : to strengthen the administra- 
tion of law in the thinly populated rural dis- 
tricts, and make honor and life safe there; to 
reform the negro criminal class, and to make 
negro public opinion cease to protect criminals. 
But the shortcomings of the work, which 
are really very few, are not the result of bias, 
but rather of a lack of a familiar knowledge 
of social and legal conditions where lynchings 
are most frequent. A few months ago, an- 
other writer on the same subject tried, with 
very satisfactory results, the experiment of 
visiting several communities where lynchings 
had occurred. The book is sane, temperate in 
tone, moderate in statement, and judicial in 
conclusions. It is the only really valuable 
treatise on the subject, and is not likely to be 
superseded. Walter L. Fleming. 



Two Recent Books on the Fak East.* 



Events in the far East have been of such an 
engrossing character within recent years as to 
lead to an immense outpouring of books and 
monographs concerning nearly every phase of 
the Oriental situation. We have had travellers' 
tales, descriptive accounts of popular life and 
customs, geographical and ethnological studies, 
and more or less ex parte accounts of political 
conditions. In the IJnited States, the manu- 
facture of books on the subject has been acceler- 
ated by our occupation of the Philippines, 
which has given rise to a special and already 
very large literature on that phase of the East- 
ern question. 

Mr. Ireland's book on 'The Far Eastern 
Tropics ' is a collection of studies in the admin- 
istration of tropical dependencies, and includes 
a review of conditions in Hong Kong, British 
North Borneo, Sarawak, the Philippines, and 
other colonies in the Orient. Most of the essays 
have been published either in the 'London 
Times' or in 'The Outlook' of New York,

American Tract Society. 



while Mr, Ireland was still travelling in the 
East. The volume belongs to the best type of lit- 
terature on colonial questions. It is the product 
of one who has not only devoted much time to 
travel and has given personal attention to 
Oriental and Colonial conditions, but who has 
as a background the prior training and intel- 
ligence necessary to enable him to judge accu- 
rately of the matters with which he has to deal. 
There is every evidence of careful and painstak- 
ing study; and the book has the unusual merit 
of being, on the whole, definite and precise in 
its statements. 

Opinions differ so widely as to the future of 
the Orient, and policies must be shaped in such 
various ways^ according as one or the other 
theory of colonial development may be ac- 
cepted, that the fundamental question to be 
asked concerning the work of any author re- 
lates to his general point of view. Mr. Ireland 
makes no effort to obscure the broad theories 
by which his work has been guided. He is 
frankly an 'imperialist,' accepting the idea 
that the future progress of the world must de- 
pend entirely upon the inhabitants of the tem- 
perate zones, and that these peoples must, for 
their own sake, control the countries and peo- 
ples of the tropics. ' The central idea from 
which we must start,' says the author, ' is this : 
that all human conditions, all human history, 
the whole expression of man in word and deed, 
are the result of the interaction of nature and 
man. , . . Apart from the work done by 
Europeans and Americans in the tropics, the 
civilization of the heat belt has remained sta- 
tionary for a thousand years. ... It may 
be taken for granted that, in tropical colonies 
controlled by Europeans or Americans, West- 
ern methods of government will be insisted on. 
. , . Western government can be main- 
tained in tropical countries only as long as 
white men are on the spot to keep things in 
line.' 

These extracts give the key-note to the whole 
of Mr. Ireland's discussion. Assuming that 
Western control is to be continued, he discusses 
conditions in the principal oriental colonies 
from the standpoint of one who regards eco- 
nomic development as the sole if not the only 
good. This economic development, too, is to be 
pursued primarily for the benefit of the West- 
ern race which happens to be in control of a 
given section of the East. Stable government, 
of course, even-handed justice between man and 
man, the improvement of the country through 
the construction of roads and of other public 
works, — all these are to be demanded of a suit- 
able colonial administration. Where possible, 
it is well, too, that native ideas should be re- 
spected and native institutions maintained, —

but only in case they do not interfere with the 
main end in view. 

Mr. Ireland's whole book is a tribute to the 
success of British administrators in establishing 
successful colonial governments based on the 
principles already set forth. Of such colonies 
as Java, French Indo-China, etc., he has rela- 
tively little to say; and in what he says he is 
inclined, with a sort of conventional British 
courtesy, to make the best of existing condi- 
tions and to give the greatest possible amount 
of credit to the foreign administrators who are 
at work there. The only exception to this rule, 
both as regards fulness of treatment and the 
exercise of the critical faculty, is found in 
what he has to say of the Philippines. 

On the whole, the author finds conditions 
both political and economic quite satisfactory 
in most of the Enghsh colonies. Of course, 
there are conspicuous exceptions and cases of 
bad administration. Mr. Ireland does not hesi- 
tate to indicate these; but it is very evident 
that in his opinion they are exceptions simply. 
In the Philippines (to which, by the way, the 
author devotes more space than to any other 
Eastern colony) the conditions seem to be re- 
versed. Cases of success or of good administra- 
tion seem to be the exception, and errors, both 
political and economic, appear to be the rule. 

The discussion of the Philippines is divided 
into several different chapters, one of which re- 
hearses the familiar history of our acquisition 
of the islands. In a second chapter the author 
analyzes the structure of government; in the 
third he reviews the economic condition of the 
Philippines; and in a fourth he criticises 
American policies as exemplified there. Mr. 
Ireland finds that serious errors have been com- 
mitted, both in framing the government and in 
pursuing the economic policy which has ex- 
cluded Philippine goods so largely from the 
United States. The great over-organization of 
government in the Philippines, Mr. Ireland be- 
lieves, has resulted in saddling an enormous 
burden upon the natives, this burden really ex- 
ceeding in the per capita cost of administration 
the outlay in any other oriental colony. In the 
same connection, it appears that an almost total 
lack of public works, and a wholly unprece- 
dented defectiveness in the means of transpor- 
tation and communication, must be added to 
the sins of the American administration. The 
* share in government,' said to have been given 
by us to the native population, is counted by 
Mr. Ireland as of relatively little value. In the 
first place, he does not believe, — as already 
seen, — that the Oriental is capable of profiting 
by such a share; in the second place, he shows 
very plainly that our methods of administra- 
tion have been such as to give to the Filipino 



only a very limited degree of participation in 
government. Neither practically nor theo- 
retically, therefore, has our administration jus- 
tified itself on the political side. Mr. Ireland, 
however, fully approves the course of the 
United States in occupying and holding the 
Philippines, for this he considers the only prac- 
tical solution of the problems which shaped 
themselves during the latter part of our war 
with Spain. As measures for the future, he 
earnestly recommends the free entry of Philip- 
pine products into the United States, the grant- 
ing of every encouragement to prospective in- 
vestors of American capital, the development of 
internal communication, the abolition of the 
Pliilippine Commission and the substitution of 
an all-powerful governor-general, and finally 
the creation of a non-political * colonial office ' 
in Washington. 

Mr. Ireland's book, both as regards its theo- 
retical attitude and its specific recommenda- 
tions of future Philippine policy, is not calcu- 
lated to please any group of people in the 
United States. He is too severe in his criti- 
cisms of actual work done to please our poli- 
ticians ; and he is far too ' imperialistic ' to 
satisfy those who believe in the self-governing 
capacity of tropical races, or at all events in the 
desirability of a national policy which will 
leave them to do the best they can. While the 
book will probably appeal to the prejudices of 
no party in this country, it cannot be consid- 
ered an impartial book, in the sense that it ad- 
vocates nothing. The author has ideas of his 
own, and does not scruple to bring forward in 
a pointed way the facts which support his ideas. 
His work is a wholesome one for Americans to 
read. It is fair to add that, while the statis- 
tical data given seem to be generally accurate, 
a few mistakes occur here and there. 

A work of entirely different character is Dr. 
John Bancroft Devins's 'An Observer in the 
Philippines.' This is a profusely illustrated, 
badly-bound volume, printed on poor paper. It 
consists very largely of familiar stories and in- 
cident of the kind that circulate freely in 
Manila society, mingled with discussions of 
Protestant missionary work in the Philippines. 
The book is dedicated to President Koosevelt, 
and has an introduction by Secretary Taft. It 
is a volume which in all cases takes the strict 
official view of matters political and economic. 
The author seems to have been the guest, at 
least during a part of his brief two-months' 
visit in the Islands, of Mr. Taft, then Gover- 
nor-General; and he has a strong approval and 
admiration for everything done by that gentle- 
man. Here and there, however, odd little inci- 
dents seem to have temporarily troubled him.

Devins remarks: 'A witness . . . was

The question and answer were translated by the 
Judge, and written on the typewriter by the 
Clerk of the Court. As the witness left the 
chair, he was required to sign his testimony in 
a language which he could not at all under- 
stand ; but,' adds the author, with touching con- 
fidence, '' it is safe to infer that the translation 
given by the Judge was correct.' 

Dr. Devins's book is non-discriminating and 
simple-minded in a high degree. It represents 
the results of a casual trip through some parts 
of the Philippines, made by one who either did 
not want, or did not understand how, to analyze 
the results of the policies that have been pur- 
sued in the archipelago. It is entertaining, and 
may well be worth reading, particularly if ex- 
amined in connection with Mr. Ireland's 
studies already described. Mr. Ireland, in fact, 
gives rather too little of the cursory and super- 
ficial which is supplied in such abundant 
measure by Dr. Devins. So far as can be 
judged. Dr. Devins is strongest on the religious 
side, — in dealing, that is to say, with the con- 
ditions and work of the missions and mission- 
ary institutions of the Philippines, in which he 
had a direct personal interest and on which his 
previous knowledge and training entitle him to 
speak with some authority.

A Ne^v History of England.* 



A new historical series, edited by Mr. C. W. 
C. Oman, has for its purpose the presenta- 
tion of the history of England from the 
beginning to 1815, in volumes by different 
authors, each of whom is supposed to be espe- 
cially qualified to write of the epoch assigned 
him. Mr. Oman's preface indicates his beHef 
that cooperative history-writing of this nature 
is of value only when each writer takes a 
sufficiently extended period to obviate the 
danger of extreme specialization; by which he 
means that the extreme specialist is apt to 
lose sight of the larger point of view and of 
the general trend of a nation's development. 
The series will therefore, he hopes, occupy a 
middle ground between the one-man type, 
where no specialization is possible, and the 
encyclopsedic type, where correlation and con- 
tinuity are sacrificed to individual monographs. 
This idea is in itself a good one, but depends

The volume now at hand, ' England Under 
the Stuarts,' by Mr. G. M. Trevelyan, cer- 
tainly fulfils Mr. Oman's requirements. It 
covers the period from 1603 to 1714, in fifteen 
chapters comprising some five hundred closely 
printed pages, has an excellent index, is sup- 
plied with a few good maps, and in addition 
to foot-note references to authorities cited in 
the body of the text it has a well arranged 
and carefully selected bibliography of works 
and sources particularly valuable to the student 
of the Stuart period. But all this, though a 
delightful innovation in the ordinary run of 
books produced by EngHsh writers, would 
count for little if the author had not shown 
his thorough understanding of the task set 
him, and accomplished his work with ability 
and in some portions with genius. It may 
briefly be said at once that Mr. Trevelyan has 
presented a thoroughly adequate summary of 
the history of the period, — as adequate, that 
is, as was possible within the limits of his 
pages. He is readable, thorough, unbiased, and 
scientific in his treatment. 

It is impossible in a brief review to do more 
than indicate a few of the important charac- 
teristics of the book. It is divided, rather too 
arbitrarily, into two distinct lines of treat- 
ment: that dealing with social, industrial, 
religious, and intellectual England; and that 
concerned with political events, although 
naturally in the narrative of the latter the 
author is forced to note occasionally and state 
the influence of topics more thoroughly analyzed 
under the flrst group. In chapter II., on 
' The Middle and Lower Classes,' Mr. Trevelyan 
notes that the economic changes of the seven- 
teenth century, changes that marked a prog- 
ress from wilderness to cultivation, resulted 
in an increased aesthetic sense among English- 
men, since the manifestations of that change 
were in themselves aesthetic, — cottages and 
mansion houses springing up in differing styles 
of architecture and furnishing a pleasing vari- 
ety. This was due to the lack of frequent 
communications between districts, a condition 
that made local need determine wholly local 
building. Englishmen built then, as they do 
now, with what was cheapest and most endur- 
ing; but then these qualities were found in 
the hedge-row whose place is now taken by 
the barbed wire fence, or in the massive oak 
timbered stables now perhaps built of corru- 
gated iron. 

City life in England receives rather more 
attention at the hands of Mr, Trevelyan than 
does the life of the agricultural community; 
but his excuse for this is that the city or town

or borough was in fact the very heart of the 
nation. The inhabitants were select, a result 
of the strict apprentice laws, by which the 
best of the country population was, with many 
restrictions, admitted to some trade and so to 
civic privileges. Surplus population found its 
last refuge in the country, and not in the 
city. The real life of England was indeed 
civic rather than national, though national 
consciousness and patriotism were awakening, 
and it was this very interest and participation 
in civic duties that produced the men capable 
of conducting the affairs of the state when 
king and hereditary officials were pushed aside. 
In all classes, says the author, the Bible was 
the one great educational factor, and its con- 
stant study, accompanied by individual inter- 
pretation, made men fit and ready to judge 
and decide for themselves in merely temporal 
affairs. Attention is called to the fact that 
the harsh Puritan Sabbath, restrictive as it 
was of all pleasure and games, and completely 
overturning previous usage, did nevertheless 
confer an inestimable boon on the laboring 
classes of modern England, in that it forbade 
work on that day as well as play. Even in 
the seventeenth century it gave a needed 
relief to an overworked population. Such are 
a few of the characteristics noted in a chapter 
full of facts and analysis, offering such con- 
cise summary, but written on the whole in a 
style not especially entertaining, and with a 
language that palls somewhat by its very sim- 
plicity and straightforwardness. 

But when Mr. Trevelyan enters the field of 
historical narrative, he indulges in a more 
ambitious style, and with marked success. 
Chapter IX., for illustration, on ' Parliament, 
Army, and King,' opens with the statement 
that 

'The government of civilized nations, especially 
of England, is the government of custom, opposed 
alike to brute force and to reform. A civilized 
nation boasts that it rides safe above the two 
enemies of custom, Constraint or Necessity on the 
one hand, and Free Will upon the other; it detests 
both the Tyrant and the Liberator. The most suc- 
cessful politicians are men of talent who hold by 
the common ways of thought.' 

This is followed by an analysis showing that 
the Commonwealth was the era of ' Free Will ' 
rule, which, unlike the French Ee volution, 
failed to establish a permanent system because 
it was representative of but a small minority 
of the nation. Cromwell himself foresaw and 
stated the futility and lack of permanence of 
his own rule as Protector. In the struggle 
between Army and Parliament, after the cap- 
ture of the King, when trying to secure a 
compromise that should represent the nation, 
he said, 'Whatever we get by treaty will be 



firm and desirable, it will be conveyed to pos- 
terity; that which you have taken by force, I 
look upon as nothing.' But when events forced 
him, as he thought, to become the despotic 
ruler of England, 'he could only keep repeat- 
ing to himself and to others that his God 
would not allow so great a work to perish.' 

The execution of the King is depicted as a 
sin of democracy against itself. The Army 
was essentially the source of this democracy. 
It demanded specifically, first, equality of 
opportunity and that 'individual merit should 
be the sole road to greatness ' ; second, a real 
universal suffrage, the demand for which was 
based both upon a fanciful and forced inter- 
pretation of earlier English history, and upon 
a theoretical analysis of the 'rights of man.' 

' "The poorest he that is in England," Colonel 
Eainborough told his fellow-officers in council, 
' ' hath a life to live as the greatest he. And there- 
fore, truly. Sir, I think it is clear that every man 
that is to' live under Government ought first by his 
own consent to put himself under that Govern- 
ment." ' 

But the Army failed to see that such innova- 
tions could come only by the consent of the 
whole nation, and after in vain attempting to 
pledge Charles to concession, it struck at him 
in exasperation, and by condemning him to 
death, purelv the act of the Army and not of 
the nation, it sounded the death-kneU of its 
own hopes in politics. 

'If there was any chance that the establishment 
of a more democratic form of government could 
gradually win the support of the people at large, 
that chance was thrown away by the execution of 
the King. . . . This at least is what appears. 
But appearances deceive many, and historians not 
the least. For history is a tangle of mysterious 
threads, of which the most important may be the 
least perceived. It may be that, deep beyond all 
consciousness, in the minds of the men who groaned 
with horror as the King's head was held up to their 
pitying gaze; deep in future years that lay beyond 
the Eestoration; deep in remote lands beyond the 
English seas, bound for a time under heavier tyran- 
nies, the knowledge that subjects had sat in rude 
judgment on their King, man against man, speeded 
the slow emancipation of the mind from the shackles 
of custom and ancient reverence. What brave men 
have done, what patient men have endured — this is 
known. But what either side has effected by its 
sufferings or its acts — this not the endless seons 
shall reveal. ' 

These quotations are from one chapter only, 
and that a short one. They are sufficient to 
show that the author is no ordinary narrative 
historian, but one who, by blending fact and 
analysis, creates a picture impressive in its 
outline and suggestive in its language and 
ideas. If the other five volumes of this series 
are in any way equal to that of Mr. Trevelyan, 
a work of decided value and novelty will have 
been offered to the public. ^ j) Adams.

Recent Fiction.* 



Translations of good foreign fiction have 
not been frequent of late years. There was a 
time, not so very long ago, when translators 
and publishers seemed unusually alert to dis- 
cover the best contemporary work of the Con- 
tinent, and to offer it to English readers. We 
were busily engaged in making the acquaint- 
ance of the most important P^uropean novelists, 
and our own practice of the art of fiction, in 
danger of growing stale, seemed to benefit 
greatly by the revivifying influence of these 
fresh currents of thought and this widening 
of the outlook. A few of the names that will 
occur to anyone seeking to illustrate this thesis 
are those of Bourget, d'Annunzio, Valera, 
Galdos, Valdes, Couperus, Jokai, Dostoievski 
and Sudermann. These children of the mod- 
ern world, and many others with them, spoke 
to us with their various accents, and a notable 
stimulus was given to the growth of cosmo- 
politan sympathies. But the crest of this 
wave of foreign influence passed over us a 
decade or more ago, and we have found our- 
selves in shoal waters of late. This literary 
condition makes all the more noticeable a 
translation, just published, of the most remark- 
able work that German fiction has produced 
for a long time. It is now three years since 
•^Jorn Uhl' took its native public by storm, 
and since then it has sold to the extent of 
something like a quarter of a million copies, 
breaking all German records. Such a book 
obviously called for translation, and it is not 
altogether to our credit that it has been so 
long kept from English readers. To the weary 
reviewer of current fiction, it comes like 
manna in the desert, and when we compare it 
with our own popular novels of like sales — 
our ' Graustarks ' and ' Eben Holdens ' — it 
inspires to melancholy reflection upon the dif- 
ferent levels of public taste in Germany and 
America. The author of ^Jorn Uhl' is a 
Lutheran pastor of a village in Holstein, by 
the jSTorth Sea. His name is Gustav Frenssen,

and he is just over forty years of age. Two 
earlier novels, ' Die Landgrafin ' and ' Die 
Drei Getreuen,' attracted little attention, but 
the success of the third has so repaid him for 
this earlier neglect that he has resigned his 
pastorate, and will henceforth devote himself 
to literature. Holsatia non cantat, says an 
old proverb, but the saying has been falsified 
by the work of Hebbel, Groth, Theodor Storm, 
and Detlev von Liliencron, to say nothing of 
the writer of genius now under consideration, 
who has made articulate to deeply-moving 
effect, the life which has its being on the 
moors and meadows and marshes that lie 
between the Eider and the Elbe. ' Jom Uhl ' 
is like an oak that is deeply rooted in its 
native soil, whence it di^aws the rugged strength 
by which it towers above the landscape, and 
attracts the attention of distant observers. It 
is a rich, homely book, seemingly artless in its 
simple sincerity, intensely human in its ap- 
peal, touched with the poetic feeling that can 
glorify the humblest material, and genuine in 
the best sense of the word. Little need be 
said of the story. In the sense of the average 
reader of novels, there is no story, but only a 
series; of nature-pictures, studies of racial 
character in a small and closely-related group, 
with folk-lore and philosophy interspersed. 
Jom Uhl, sprung from a peasant stock of 
ancient repute, grows up to realize that the 
family fortunes are decaying, that the farm is 
going to waste, and that his father and older 
brothers, drunken and shiftless, are incapable 
of saving themselves from ruin. He takes up 
the burden thus laid upon his shoulders, and 
struggles manfully for many years against a 
fate that is inexorable. In this aspect, as well 
as in the sombreness of its atmosphere, the 
book is strikingly like Herr Sudermann's 
' Frau Sorge ' — the differences being such as 
naturally exist between Holstein and East 
Prussia. But ' Jom Uhl ' is a richer work 
than that idyl of sorrow, and has more of 
poetic relief. This quality has for its defect a 
looseness of structure that deprives the work 
of unity and plan except in a very broad sense. 
Episodical matter is frequent and often only 
vaguely relevant. Even the episode of the 
War of 1870-71, with its realistic description 
of Gravelotte, is not worked into any very 
intimate relation with the plot. Jorn simply 
went when he was called to arms, did his duty 
uncomplainingly, and returned to his farm 
when the campaign was over. But on their 
own account we could ill spare these scenes of 
camp and conflict, for they constitute a mas- 
terpiece of their kind. The translator of this 
work is Mr. F. S. Delmer, whose work is well 
done, although we regard as questionable the

expedient of employing Scotch dialect for the 
purpose of reproducing the ' Doric note ' of 
the original. 

Another translation from the German gives 
us Herr Adolf Wilbrandfs ' Oster-Insel/ a 
novel dating from 1894, The English version 
is entitled *' A New Humanity/ and is the 
work of Dr. A. S. Eappoport. This book, as 
students of German literature are aware, is 
essentially a study of the philosopher Nietz- 
sche, the tragedy of whose life is reproduced 
in the guise of fiction. Its hero. Dr. Helmut 
Adler, is inspired with a belief in the possi- 
bility of a new type of humanity, to be 
evolved under conditions of special nurture 
and selection upon an island in the South 
Pacific. This idea becomes first an obsession, 
and then a mania, and finally reduces to ir- 
remediable madness the powerful intellect that 
has conceived it. The story is told with a 
certain morbid power, but drags heavily in the 
telling, and is only moderately successful in 
the delineation of the several types of charac- 
ter which people its pages. 

Mr. Quiller-Couch is at his happiest and 
best in ' Shining Ferry, ' a novel of the Corn- 
wall which he knows so well, and which he 
presents to us with so much sympathy and 
humor. The figures of the local magnate, the 
contemptible son who succeeds him, the new 
schoolmistress, and her bashful sailor-lover, 
are admirable studies of character, and several 
of the lesser figures — Mr. Benny, the confi- 
dential clerk, Nicky Vro, the ancient ferry- 
man, and Mrs. Purchase, the skipper's better 
half in the literal sense, are worthy of being 
classed with the creations of Dickens. This is 
a book of which no notion whatever may be 
given by an outline of the plot; its charm 
resides in the touches of gentle sentiment, of 
quaint humor, and of tender feeling with 
which it is enriched in every chapter. It is a 
wholesome and human book, to be read with 
keen delight from beginning to end. 

* Belcharaber,' by Mr. Howard Overing 
Sturgis (a name unknown to us), is a strong 
novel made decidedly unpleasant by its theme 
of adulter}', or rather by the author's failure 
to maintain a decent reticence in the handling 
of that theme. If it were not for this fault, 
the book would deserve high praise, for there 
is nothing amateurish about either style or 
construction, and it moves easily among the 
scenes and situations which it presents to us. 
It is a novel of upper-class English society, 
and has a most lovable and sympathetic hero, 
whose life from childhood up is skilfully por- 
trayed. It is such a book as we sometimes get 
from Mr. Anthony Hope, with an added 
touch of seriousness quite beyond the reach of 
that brilliant writer. 



About thirteen years ago there was pub- 
lished a remarkable work of fiction entitled 
' Calmire.' The book was anonymous, and 
was fiction only in a very qualified sense, be- 
ing primarily a discussion of the fundamental 
problems of religious and ethical philosophy. 
It was clearly the work of an acute thinker 
who was also a genial man of the world, and 
its brilliant yet unstilted exposition of the ab- 
struse matters with which it was concerned 
made it a highly noteworthy production. Writ- 
ing of it at the time, we called it 'a. helpful 
book,' and described it as offering * a faith as 
far transcending that of our childhood as the 
wide world itself transcends the nursery.' Ee- 
markable as ' Calmire ' was, it seems to have 
made little impression upon the public, 
and, aside from the reviews which it received 
as a perfunctory matter of course, it got 
nothing like the attention it deserved. Dur- 
ing the years that have elapsed since its ap- 
pearance, we do not recall having met with 
any person who has read it, or having seen it 
mentioned anywhere in print. We now have 
from the same hand a second work, entitled 
' Sturmsee,' which introduces many of the 
earlier characters, but this time engages them 
in the discussion of social and political themes. 
The two works are now seen to be mutually 
complementarj', and to embody a singularly 
ijipe and balanced conception of 'the whole 
duty of man,' as seen in the light of the evolu- 
tionary' philosophy. The author, in fact, con- 
fesses to this purpose in his preface to the 
new volume, to which he gives the sub-title 
* Man and Man,' as contrasted with the * Man 
and Nature,' which he now suggests for the 
earlier work. We have, we trust, said enough 
to warn off from this book the seeker after 
mere entertainment, and to attract to it those 
readers of serious intent for whom alone it is 
designed. It is not entirely without interest 
as a story, but it is essentially a book of dis- 
cussions to which a conversational and pic- 
turesque form of exposition gives point and 
animation. The subjects range over the field 
suggested by such phrases as the labor prob- 
lem, cooperation, socialism, anarchism, social 
settlements, monopolies, and the significance of 
democracy. This random list gives only the 
capital headings, without conveying any 
notion of the ramifications and special appli- 
cations which the exigencies of the story de- 
mand. For, we repeat, there is a story, albeit 
a thin one and of disjointed structure. There 
are also characters, fairly well-defined and 
interesting, instead of the mere pegs for opin- 
ions which our description might lead the 
reader to expect. There are even incidents as 
exciting as a labor riot and an anarchistic at- 
tempt at assassination, besides some really

charming love-making, and no end of delicious 
banter and conversational by-play. We must 
describe the author (whoever he may be) as a 
good American, by which we mean a man who 
believes from the bottom of his heart in the 
great democratic experiment which we are 
working out upon this continent, yet who 
makes no concessions to the clamor of the vul- 
gar or bombastic spokesmen of democracy, who 
is even readier to voice a caustic condemnation 
of our national faults than to pen the praises 
of our virtues, and who does not hesitate to 
find many examples worthy of our emulation 
in the ' eifete ' societies of the European world. 
Two brief extracts may close this review. 
Calmire, speaking of philanthropic effort in 
general, says : ' The devotion of the able man's 
surplus must be voluntary, to be effective. To 
compel it by taxation, or in any other way, 
has all the faults of robbery, including dis- 
couraging the production of any surplus.' It 
would be difficult to pack more wisdom than 
this within the same compass of words. It is 
also Calmire who thus sums up the moral of 
the whole argument : ' If there's a purpose in 
this universe (I don't say that there is or 
isn't, partly, perhaps, because I hate to apply 
the phraseology made for our tuppenny minds 
to the immeasurable processes going on behind 
all they can take note of) — if there's a pur- 
pose, or a plan, nothing seems to me plainer 
than that it's part of that plan, to evolve hap- 
piness through intelligence and morality, and 
primitive intelligence and morality through 
struggle, but to evolve the higher morality 
through the opposite of struggle — through the 
care of the weak by the strong, and the recip- 
rocation of the weak to the strong — sympathy 
and generosity on one side, fidelity and grati- 
tude on the other, until all are strong.' There 
is no sentimentalism about this book, which 
exposes with keen and merciless logic the 
weakness of the various socialistic panaceas of 
which in these days we hear so much; but 
there is social sympathy of the broadest kind, 
which is a much better quality. We confess 
to no little curiosity concerning the authorship 
of this wise and helpful work. 

Turning from ' Sturmsee,' with its abstract 
discussion of the labor problem, we find in 
Mr. Scott's 'The W^alking Delegate' a dis- 
tinctly concrete treatment of the same subject. 
Here we have a work which is fairly brutal in 
its realism, a vivid and vigorous transcript of 
life in the labor world of a great city, a book 
written without any pretence of style, yet 
crudely impressive by virtue of its picturesque 
speech and its close acquaintance with the con- 
ditions depicted. It is a study of the * labor 
leader' and his methods — as illustrated by a 



Parks or a Shea — and unsparingly exposes the 
corrupt and criminal practices whereby a 
strong and unscrupulous bully becomes the 
master of his union and maintains the terror- 
ism of his rule. His exposure and disgrace 
are finally brought about by the persistent 
efforts of the honest workingman who opposes 
him, and virtue is triumphant in the end. 
The book is quite as scathing in its treatment 
of the corrupt methods of the employer as in 
its implied denunciation of trade union meth- 
ods, and thus holds a fairly even scale be- 
tween the two parties to the struggle. It is a 
veritable sink of iniquity that is here uncov- 
ered for our gaze, but the whole story is made 
only too sadly credible by the actual occur- 
rences with which our newspapers make us 
familiar from day to day. 

Two American novels of the Reconstruction 
period, now before us, while very different in 
their methods, are alike in their close study of 
the perplexing conditions of the years imme- 
diately following the Civil War. One of 
them, ' The Lion's Skin,' is the work of Mr. 
John S. Wise, who has played an important 
part in the recent political history of Virginia, 
and who is the son of the war governor of 
that State. In this book there is far more 
history than fiction; in fact, the author seems 
to have adopted the form of the novel chiefly 
as the means of attracting a wider circle of 
readers than might otherwise have been 
secured for what is essentially a volume of 
personal reminiscences and a running com- 
mentary upon the political history of his 
native Commonwealth. There is much con- 
tentious matter in this book, and the author 
adopts many positions that will be questioned, 
particularly in his defence of Mahone and the 
policy of the ' readjusters.' He laments the 
decline of political morality that has charac- 
terized Virginia of recent years, and is no less 
unsparing in his denunciation of corrupt 
modern tendencies than in his scathing ac- 
count of the carpet-baggers' regime. Of the 
popular historical novelists who have dealt 
with this region and period he seems to have 
but a poor opinion, but if they might profit- 
ably learn from him as to matters of fact, he, 
in turn, might well take lessons from them in 
the art of fiction. 

Our other novel of Eeconstruction days is 
the work of Dr. Mitchell, and the scene is 
Missouri. Here the admixture of history is 
slight, merely enough to provide the story 
with atmosphere and the tragedy with an ade- 
quate motive. Dr. Mitchell's concern is pri- 
marily artistic, as we hardly need to state, 
and his artistic success, in the present in- 
stance, is marked and complete. ' Constance

Trescot' is a novel which is given more than 
ordinary distinction by the conscientiousness 
of its endeavor, the sincerity of its workman- 
ship, and its high human interest. Xot only 
is the general plan of the work praiseworthy, 
but the details are worked out with lo\'ing 
skill, and the lesser characters and situations 
are never scamped for the sake of those of 
greater significance. The story is briefly as 
follows: George Trescot is a young lawyer of 
Boston who marries the daughter of a whim- 
sic-al and opinionated capitalist. His father- 
in-law has large propert}- interests in a South- 
ern town on the Mississippi and thither Tres- 
cot is sent to act as agent, and disentangle a 
network of legal complications. His position 
is a difficult one, for not only is sectional feel- 
ing rife in the community to which he goes, 
but he labors under the additional disadvan- 
tage of coming as a stranger to attack squatter 
claims. Both he and his wife meet this situa- 
tion with peculiar tact, and their conciliatory 
measures do much to soften the asperities of 
the legal struggle. But the opposing counsel, 
finding himself practically defeated, and em- 
bittered by the blow thus dealt to his personal 
interests, revenges himself by shooting Trescot 
upon a purely imaginary pretext of self-de- 
fence. From this point on, the interest is con- 
centrated upon the assassin and the widow 
of his victim. The former, acquitted by the 
courts, is made the object of a relentless cam- 
paign conducted by the injured woman, a 
campaign of vindictiveness untempered by any 
touch of mercy or compassion. She employs 
every agency within her reach, and inflicts 
upon him such moral tortures that he is 
driven in desperation to end his own life. It 
is not a pleasant story, but it is a strong one, 
and it deepens in tragic intensity until the 
reader is held breathless in its grasp. It is 
a great triumph, thus out of commonplace 
materials, and by the use of strictly legitimate 
methods, to produce a work of such singular 
power, and Dr. Mitchell deserves the warmest 
congratulations upon his success.

on Puritanic {HoughtoD, Mifflin & Co.). Mr. An- 
characters. ^^^^ MacPhail has produced an 
uncommonly readable and instructive book. He 
has a vein of quaint humor which helps him 
to treat such confessedly dry subjects as Cal- 
vinism and the writings of Jonathan Edwards in 
a manner which makes them not unattractive to 
the readers of to-day. He is able in the same 
sentence to give us a flash of truth and to make 
us smile at his novel and clever way of putting 



it. If he sometimes arouses our suspicion that 
he is overdoing the business of being novel and 
clever, let us not be too hard on him, but remem- 
ber what he is trying to do: to interest his au- 
dience (originally a company of artists) in a 
subject not only dry but to them actually dis- 
agreeable; to show them something of the work 
which Puritanism has accomplished in the world, 
and of the relationship of Puritanism to the 
spirit of beauty. The author is not blind to the 
shortcomings of the Puritan, — his narrow and 
painfully limited views of life; his dogmatic ar- 
rogance regarding knowledge of the hereafter, 
especially of hell; his comic misplacing of energy 
(as when Jonathan Edwards became a missionary 
to the Indians). Yet as we read these pages we 
cannot help feeling the essential sublimity of 
the Puritan struggle after perfection, and the 
real greatness— even though it lacked proportion 
— of the Puritan character. Jonathan Edwards 
awakened the people of New England and spread 
views that bore fruit in the great humanitarian 
movement. The rule of John Winthrop, even 
though he failed to hold church and state to- 
gether, is full of significance to those who long 
for civic and civil righteousness. The real 
Margaret Fuller was not an absurd creature, but 
a heroic Puritan woman, who made mistakes but 
nevertheless exhibited admirable traits, and was 
the victim as much of friends as of enemies. 
Walt Whitman shows us that the Puritan is 
sometimes the radical rising in primitive sim- 
plicity and breaking down the barriers of false 
and absurd conventionality. Through the great 
revival begun by John Wesley, the spirit of re- 
ligion, which was the essence of Puritanism, was 
quickened and deepened. All these, then, are 
»gnificant characters, whose lives help us to 
understand the various phases and stages of the 
Puritan movement. The reader of Mr. Mac- 
Phail 's volume will be rewarded with new light, 
and of some matters he will perhaps get a new 

point of view. 

Misa Coreiii Some recent periodical contribu- 
apeakaher tions by Miss Marie CoreUi have 
***'^ been issued in book form under 

the title, 'Free Opinions Freely Expressed' 
(Dodd). The disputatious, not to say censorious, 
tone of these essays moves the reviewer to re- 
mind the writer that people are seldom to be 
argued or scolded into wisdom. Direct assaults 
on foUy too often produce an effect contrary to 
the one intended. Miss Corelli's dispraise of 
yellow journalism, and the incidental display of 
her own familiarity with the odious thing, will 
hardly diminish by one copy the sale of any yel- 
low journal. Why not turn one's back on the 
wretched stuff and let one's silent influence ef- 
fect what it may? More than once the author 
indulges in censure of 'the free-library craze,' 
ajid of its chief promoter, Mr. Andrew Carnegie. 
'To borrow one's mental fare from Free Li- 
braries,' she declares, 'is a dirty habit, to begin 
with'; and other reasons follow why we should 
shun the public library. The best she can say 
of free libraries is that they are 'undoubtedly 
verj- useful resorts for betting men. They can

run in, glance at the newspapers for the latest 
''Sporting Items," and run out again. But why 
ratepayers should support such houses of call for 
these gentry remains a mystery' to Miss Corelli. 
Her animus is explained later, when she laments 
the injury done to popular authors by free li- 
braries, whose circulation of a dozen copies of 
the latest novel pj-events its purchase by hun- 
dreds of readers. In this connection may be 
noted her chapter on 'A Question of Faith,' 
wherein she declares herself a Christian; asserts 
that a consistent Christian must believe in the 
virtue of poverty, the dignity of labor, and the 
excellence of simplicity; and urges her readers 
to be consistent. Why, then, this grudge against 
Mr. Cai-negie and his libraries, if they are help- 
ing her to a more vivid realization of the virtue 
of poverty and the dignity of labor? Seriously, 
she should know that whatever harm free li- 
braries may do to popular authors (a harm, by 
the way, that it might be difficult to prove) is 
more than balanced by the good they do to stu- 
dents, whose researches would often be impos- 
sible without the collections of books now avail- 
able in all our larger cities. Of Americans, Miss 
Corelli says some harsh things that may make 
one wish her better acquainted with us. Her 
chapter on 'A Vital Point of Education' de- 
plores the general ignorance of how to read. 
She thinks that 'Americans, even more than the 
British, require to be taught' this art. An ex- 
pression used by her a little later suggests the 
equal desirability of learning how to write. Re- 
ferring to two classes of persons, she speaks of 
the one forming 'the larger majority.' What, 
one queries, would a 'smaller majority' be? Miss 
Corelli 's admirers— and their name, largely per- 
haps owing to public libraries, is legion— will en- 
joy these twenty-seven essays, which have the 
merit of brevity and at times of sprightliness. 

The seventh volume of the 'Moderii 
o/roSf"English Writers' series (Dodd, 

Mead & Co.), on Browning, is 
written by Professor Charles H. Herford of 
the University of Manchester. The commen- 
tator knows his Browning well, has availed him- 
self of the best and latest authorities, and mani- 
fests a considerable degree of sympathetic appre- 
ciation; but he is hampered in his presentation 
by a clumsiness of expression which recalls the 
story of the plain man who reported his entire 
understanding of Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress' 
and his hope that in time he might be able to 
master the explanatoi*y notes. We get on with 
him passably well, however, through Part I., on 
Browning's Life and Work; but in Part II., on 
his Mind and Art, he out-Brownings Browning in 
his use of unusual words, and in tangled, in- 
volved and obscure phrases. Whether or not we 
understand Browning's doctrine of love, surely 
we cannot be much helped by being told that 'It 
started up in corrupt or sordid hearts and swept 
all their blind velleities into its purifying flame 
of passion,' and what are we to understand by 
such phrases as 'eager, articulating concrete sen- 
sibility,' 'visual speech of sharply cut angles and 



saliences,' 'nodosities of character,' etc.? Even 
in his preface the author can make known his 
purpose only in such blind and inconclusive 
fashion as this: 'This book may perhaps be de- 
scribed as an attempt to work out, in the detail 
of Browning's life and poetry, from a more 
definitely literary standpoint and without Hege- 
lian prepossessions, a view of his genius not un- 
like that set forth with so much eloquence and 
Ijenetration, in his well-known volume, by Pro- 
fessor Henry Jones.' Is Professor Herford 
aware that America has furnished almost the 
first and still some of the most enthusiastic in- 
terpreters of Browning, when he says (p. 4) that, 
except in Italy, 'Browning is all but non-existent 
for the rest of the civilized world beyond the 
Channel?' Numerous misquotations frorn the 
poems, in a case where the smallest inaccuracy 
is unpardonable, do not strengthen our confidence 
in Professor Herford or his book. However, it 
no doubt has its value, and its groupings of 
poems and generalizations regarding Browning's 
standpoint and mission are, to say the least, sug- 
gestive, 

One of the great obstacles en- 
foniai'histTr'y. countered by students of Southern 

Colonial history has been the lack 
of accessible and trustworthy sources of infor- 
mation. While the Northern States, and notably 
those of New England, have for many years been 
doing everything in their power to facilitate 
the work of historians in the field of Colonial 
history, the Southern States, on the other hand, 
have been exceedingly backward in this work, 
and students have had the greatest difficulty in 
uncovering their Colonial records. This per- 
haps accounts in a measure for the misstatements 
that have crept into current writing regard- 
ing the Colonial history and activities of the 
Southern States. Notably is this the case with 
Virginia. No State in the Union has perhaps 
more complete, full, and well-preserved Colonial 
records; but these documents have for many 
years been buried away beyond the reach of the 
most zealous investigator. With the adoption of 
the new constitution of Virginia, provision was 
made for the proper care and preservation of 
these documents, which had suffered much from 
neglect and vandalism. For two years past, a 
trained library force has been engaged in classi- 
fying and arranging these records. The recent 
publication, by the Library Board at Richmond, 
of the Journals of the House of Burgesses of 
Virginia for the years 1773-1776, will be wel- 
comed by students throughout the country. No 
period of the State's history is richer in sug- 
gestion or more valuable in its relation to the 
history of the country than the few years im- 
mediately preceding the Revolution. With an 
unpopular Governor and a somewhat verbose 
House of Burgesses, frequent quarrels took place 
within the State during this time. Some of these 
were of small importance, but everj- one drew 
from the Burgesses an indignant protest against 
what they held to be an assumption of power by 
the Governor. He, however, indignantly pro-

tested against such a charge; and his frequent 
addresses, together with the Memorials of the 
Burgesses, all of which are incorporated in the 
present publication, form an invaluable commen- 
tary on the history of the times, and will go 
far toward correcting some of the mistakes in 
the current histories of the Revolution. The 
work of editing the volume has been ably done 
by Mr. John Pendleton Kennedy, the State Li- 
brarian of Virginia, who has added a valuable 
introduction containing numerous extracts from 
contemporary newspapers and unpublished 
'Broadsides.' The letters and minutes of the 
Colonial Committee of Correspondence are ap- 
pended to the Journal of each year, and add 
much to the value of the work. It is to be hoped 
that Mr. Kennedy's anouncement that the entire 
series of Burgess Journals will be printed is to 
be carried into effect, and that he will also be 
able to comply with the request of students to 
print the valuable collections of transcripts in 
the Library from the British Museum and Brit- 
ish Records office 

Few and fit will be the readers at- 
u^lV^aV!^' tracted to the late Armine Thomas 

Kent's *Otia,' edited by Mr. Harold 
Hodge, of the 'Saturday Review,' prefaced 
with a brief memoir by Mr. Arthur A. Bau- 
mann, and published by Mr. John Lane. Mr. 
Kent's early literary success gave promise of 
noteworthy achievement still to come; but he 
died at the age of forty-seven without accom- 
plishing anj'thing in letters worthy of his fine 
scholarship, his critical acumen, and his poetic 
gift. 'A dangerously comfortable income' and a 
ready yielding to the claims of society are partly 
responsible for this. The volume under review em- 
braces the printed, and a few hitherto unprinted, 
products of his graceful and scholarly pen, being 
chiefly short book-notices contributed to the * Sat- 
urday R€%-iew.' These deal principally with 
poetry, or books about poetry, and go somewhat 
minutely into matters of style and even into 
verbal criticism. Two longer essays, on the Delia 
Cruscans and on Leigh Hunt as a poet, are re- 
printed from the 'National Review' and the 
'Fortnightly' respectively. Twenty-five short 
poems from Mr. Kent 's i>en are scattered through 
the book. Excellent in its way, and characteris- 
tic, is the discussion of 'The Pains of Rhyme,' 
deploring the staleness of most of our available 
rhjTnes. Painters may 'repeatedly and trium- 
phantly surmount the difficulties of their art,' 
but 'the man has yet to be bom who can make 
repeated and triumphant rhymes to "moon." * In 
the matter of verse-making, the author elsewhere 
pours out his scorn on the time-honored practice 
of inversion to suit the exigencies of metre and 
rhjTne, as Wbrdsworth 's, 'My name is Alice Fell, 
and I to Durham, sir, belong'; or ^Well for our 
whistles run a rae€.' What, then, has he to say 
for this line of his own,— 'He the soon coming 
of his July knows,' or this, 'My thoughts on 
vaguer issues wait'? Other instances are easily 
found. Mr. Kent had a fine ear to detect un- 
musical or limping lines, and a keen sense for 



lapses into prose. Resorting once more to the 
'tu quoque,' the reviewer would ask him to de- 
fend this couplet from his 'Springtime,' — 

' Sudden and loud through larch and fir 
Rings the laugh of the woodpecker.' 

To say nothing of the borrowing here from 
Mallock's line, 'The long loose laugh of the wild 
woodj>eeker, ' who is not reminded of the dog- 
gerel, 'Punch, brothers, punch,' with its absurd 
stress on the last syllable of 'passenger'? Mf. 
Kent's sonnet on Lord Beacoustield has this 
limping line, 'How scathlessly from out the fury 
and foam.' Just after animadverting on the split 
infinitive, we find the critic guilty of 'no less 
than four new editions, ' a' use of less for fewer 
which he soon afterward repeats. These are 
trifles light as air, but polish brings out even 
minute flaws, and in treating a writer who pays 
such attention to the small pjoints of style, and 
who incidentally sneers at 'the shallower sort of 
American scholars,' an American reviewer feels 
justified in pointing out minute defects. Mr. 
Kent's ' Schraden-f reude ' for 'Schadenfreude' is 
another small error, for which, after all, perhaps 
the long-suffering printer will consent to bear 
the blame. 

Oregon Trail, The centennial of the Lewis and 
and life in the Clark Expedition has drawn public 
ttev) country, attention to our great Northwest 
country, reviving our interest in its history and 
in its wonderful natural resources. A glimpse 
of the life of the early immigrants during the 
toilsome march across the plains and through the 
mountains and deserts, and of the social condi- 
tions in the new land, is afforded by Mrs. Abigail 
Scott Duniway's 'From the West to the West' 
(McCluj^). The tale is apparently founded up<Mi 
a journal kept by a young girl who was a member 
of an overland party in the early fifties, and por- 
trays in a realistic fashion the hardships and 
perils and dilemmas which beset the path of the 
pioneers. Into this story of adventure is woven 
a series of romances which give the author an 
opportunity to exploit her ideas on such diverse 
themes as the property rights of wives, woman 
suffrage, and thought-transference. The book 
affords an interesting though somewhat idealized 
picture of the early days, but makes no preten- 
sions to historical or geographical accuracy,— as 
witness the arrival of the hero at San Francisco 
from Astoria after ' four days of languorous idle- 
ness on a glassy sea {sicf). with * lights of the 
Farallones to the leeward, while on their left 
rose Mare Island; and they knew that they were 
neariug the Golden Gate.'— In the 'Letters from 
an Oregon Ranch,' from the same publishers, we 
are given a series of pictures of the out-of-door 
pioneer life of to-day in that romantic region. 
Surely no 'native son' could be more genuinely 
enthusiastic over the beauties and possibilities of 
his. State than is this newly adopted 'webfooter' 
who has abandoned city life in the East for the 
trials and discomforts of the frontier. Nothing 
daunts her cheery enthusiasm; deficiencies in 
equipment or supplies only make more strenuous 
call upon ingenuity, or give occasion for cheerful

tunity for charming details of fireside comfort. 
There are a number of attractive full-page illus- 
trations, which, with the author's pleasing in- 
terpretations of the green and growing world 
about her, give an excellent idea of the verdure- 
clad coast regions of Oregon. 



A study of To write expertly of children re- 

aoth century quires such a vast fund of informa- 
children. ^j^^ j^^j immediate experience that 

it is generally considered quite a hopeless task, 
readily attempted and as readily neglected. To 
write of one child, or of some children, is com- 
parative easy; but children as a class or as a 
social factor otfer obstacles to the pens of all 
except such daring spirits as Mrs. Charlotte 
Perkins Oilman, and such martyi-s to the cause 
as Mr. E. H. Cooper. Even Mr. Cooper, in his 
chai-ming book on ' The Twentieth Century Child ' 
(John Ijane), makes terms witli his subject and 
discusses English children, and, of those, mostly 
the children of the better classes. The value of 
his book lies largely in its very personal tone, 
in the assurance it gives that stories and inci- 
dents are simple reality, and therefore that Mr. 
Cooper's theories are based on sound experience. 
These theories are well worth study, contain- 
ing hints r^arding the proper management of 
the child in all its relations, at play, at lessons, 
in sickness, in company. The chapter on Prayers 
is especially suggestive, although the premise is 
hardly one to be generally conceded. 'Religious 
feeling,' Mr. Cooper says, 'may or may not be 
a matter of temperament in the case of grown- 
up folk; in the nursery there is, I imagine, no 
emotion or lesson which can be less easily forced 
into the pupil's mind.' In spite of an intense 
interest in and fondness for ' The Twentieth Cen- 
tury Child,' Mr. Cooper is rarely or never senti- 
mental about him, and writes with more than 
usual sense about the child 's personal responsibil- 
ity for the leading attributes of his character. 
'The disagreeable child' is as important a factor 
in nursery life as the disagreeable man is in the 
life of the world, and any system of training 
which leaves out of account a child's innate ten- 
dency toward the disagreeable is boimd to be mi- 
fair to the child who most requires system. Mr. 
Cooper supplements his theoretical writings with 
stories by children, and with others about chil- 
dren, that lend attractiveness to his book. 

Cranmerand The dignified and weighty series of 
the English moderate-sized biographies of the 
Reformation. ^Heroes of the Nations' (Putnam) 
is continued by Mr. Albert Frederick Pol- 
lard's 'Thomas Cranmer and the English Re- 
formation,' 1489-1556. The author writes with 
the authority of a professor of constitutional 
history in University College, London, and 
of previously successful authorship upon the 
history of this complex period. After a chapter 
on Cranmer 's early life, the story begins with 
the divorce of Catharine of Aragon, with special 
reference to Cranmer 's part in bringing it about. 
Succeeding chapters discuss the Royal Suprem- 



acy, the various steps in the reform m.ovement 
under Henry VIII. and Edward, the Catholic 
Reaction, the Books of Common Prayer, and his 
martyi'dom under Queen Mary. The character 
and ability of Cranmer are skilfully portrayed, 
and the work may be counted as a real contri- 
bution to popular knowledge on this important 
period. TAventy portraits embellish the volume 
and add to its value.

PROFESSOR EDWARD CHANNINQ'S 
" The Planting of a Nation in the New World " 

IS THE FIRST VOLUME OF HIS 

A History of the 
United States 

To be complete in eight volumes of from five hundred to six 
hundred pages each, 8vo, bound in dark blue cloth, with gilt top 
and title, etc. Altogether a handsome and a valuable library set. 

Price of each volume^ $2.50 net (postage 27 cts.) 

** The guiding idea of tlie present WOrIc is to view the subject as the record of an evolution, and to 
trace the growth of the nation from the standpoint of that which preceded, rather than from that which followed," 
quotes The Nation from Dr. Channing's Preface, and continues : 

*' The satisfactory realization of these two principles constitutes the distinguishing char- 
acteristic of the first volume. . . . The most enduring impression which Professor Chan- 
ning's work leaves upon the mind in respect of scholarship is, indeed, the sense of mastery. 

. . . The narration moves easily along, without haste and without rest, devoid of ornament, but not without its 
quiet humor at times, or now and then a biting epigram. . . . But to do justice to the book it is neessary to read 
it, and that is undoubtedly what all students of American history will do while awaiting the subsequent volumes." 

The Atlantic Monthly comments : 

*< From Professor Channing's beginning it is evident that his will be a standard history. 

He writes with perfect independence after weighing all the testimony. He is very sober-minded, with a preference 
for moderate statement, and for reducing legends to their lowest terms. He leans to the critical rather than to 
the narrative side. As there is in America no historian more careful and thorough than he, and none more loyal 
to the scientific method, so it is noteworthy that he has given great attention to the literary form of his history. 
From the promise of his first volume one may predict that he will hold for years to come a position similar to that 
held by Bancroft in an earlier generation." 

" When the well-known logic and accuracy of this writer is considered, his constructive genius, sense of pro- 
portion, and vivid feeling for the dramatic color and movement that of themselves make the great facts of history 
a thing of life, rather than a dull catalogfue of causes and effects which it becomes in the hands of some of our 
established historians, the charm and the interest of such history writing cannot be overestimated." 

— ToKONTO Mail and Empire, June 3, 1905. 

" It is rare to find a scholarly history which has so great a charm." 

— The Conobbgationalist, June 17, 1905. 

" The scholarship easily surpasses that in any other undertaking of the kind, and the clear, pleasing, and 
simple style makes the book eminently readable." — New York Independent, June 29, 1905.

NOTES 71 



FREDERICK DENIS ON MAURICE. 

Aubrey de Vere used to say that listening to 
Maurice was like eating pea-soup with a fork. 
Professor Jowett, in describing to Sir M. E. 
Grant Duff a sermon preached by Maurice be- 
fore the University of Oxford, said, *A11 that 
I could make out was that today was yesterday, 
and this world the same as the next.' In one 
of her lively letters, Mrs. Carlyle writes: *Mr. 
Maurice we rarely see, nor do I greatly regret 
his absence; for, to tell you the truth, I am 
never in his company without being attacked 
with a sort of paroxism of mental cramp! He 
keeps one always, with his wire-drawings and 
paradoxes, as if one were dancing on the points 
of one's toes (spiritually speaking). And then 
he will help with the kettle, and never fails to 
pour it all over the milk-pot and sugar basin ! ' 
A letter from Carlyle himself to his mother 
characterizes poor Maurice in much the same 
manner, but more emphatically, — *one of the 
most entirely uninteresting men of cenius that I 
can meet ;' and ' all twisted, screwed, wiredrawn, 
with such restless sensitiveness, the utmost ina- 
bility to let nature have fair play with him ;' and 
again, ^I do not remember that a word ever 
came from him betokening clear recognition or 
healthy free sympathy with anything.' Mar- 
tineau found Maurice's ' Theological Essays ' 
'on the whole shadowy and unimpressive. I 
hardly think,' he continues, ' a man has any 
business to write till he has brought his thoughts 
into distincter shapes and better defined rela- 
tions than I find in Maurice. He seems to me 
to have a mere presentiment of thinking, a ten- 
tative process in the direction that never fairly 
succeeds in getting home.' Finally, John 
Stuart Mill maintained that 'great ingenuity 
and subtlety, and a wide perception of import*^ 
ant and unobvious truths, served him, not for 
putting something better into the worthless 
heap of received opinions on the great subjects 
of thought, but for proving to his own mind 
that the Church of England had known every- 
thing from the first, and that all the truths oi» 
the ground of which the church and orthodoxy 
have been attacked (many of which he saw as 
clearly as any one), are not only consistent witb 
the Thirty-nine Articles, but are better under- 
stood and expressed in these Articles than by 
any one who rejects them.' 

These and many more adverse criticisms,.

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



amid innumerable eulogies of exactly contrary 
import, have been passed upon a man who ex- 
erted a powerful influence for good in his time, 
and the hundredth anniversary of whose birth 
now recalls him, not unwelcomely, to mind. It 
may be interesting, without attempting any 
originality of treatment or trying to fix anew 
his place "in English literature and thought, to 
glance briefly back over Maurice's life and recall 
some of the things he has said and some of the 
things others have said about him. He was 
born Aug. 29, 1805, at Normanstone, near 
Lowestoft, being the fifth child of a rather re- 
markably philoprogenitive Unitarian minister 
and teacher of youth. The diversity of religious 
preference shown by the nimierous members of 
the Maurice family, including the mother, and 
their epistolary method of communicating their 
lapses into orthodoxy to the heterodox father 
under whose roof they all dwelt in common, pre- 
sent a scene of some picturesqueness. Frederick 
himself seems early to have developed inde- 
pendent views in religion and never to have 
embraced his father's Unitarianism, life-long 
dissenter though he was from the conventional 
Church-of-Englandism. Educated at Cam- 
Ibridge, he left the university in 1827 without 
ia degree, his quarrel with the Thirty-nine Arti- 
ecles, to which he afterward became so notably 
ffeeonciled, depriving him of a diploma. Then 
tfoUowed a short experience of literary life in 
London, where he wrote his philosophical novel, 
'Eustace Conway,' and where at the age of 
twenty-three he edited the then recently com- 
bined ' Athenaeum ' and ' Literary Chronicle ' — 
unsuccessfully from a commercial point of 
view. Perhaps a passage from one of his edi- 
torials will partly explain this unsuccess. It 
certainly reveals qualities that make one regret 
the writer's early abandonment of the pen 
for the pulpit as a profession. The editorial is 
probably unexampled in journalism. 

'It is very gratifying,' he writes, *to think 
that the influence of reviewers upon society is 
every day becoming more and more limited. In 
nine cases out of ten it is a question of no ma- 
terial consequence to the public, or to any indi- 
vidual of it, whether the verdicts which they 
jgive are carelessly uttered or are the result of 
mature and conscientious deliberation. The 
anost perseveringly impartial and earnest critic 
will find that he has some power of 
:strengthening the foundations of his readers' 
•opinions, but very little of forming those 
•opinions, or changing them, while the 
most indefatigable of the scribes of darkness 
-can scarcely flatter himself that he has done any 
single act of successful mischief, and must con- 
sole himself with the reflection that, in the 
fiilent work of lowering the tone of public feel- 



ing and morality, his labours have been wholly 
in vain.' 

Surely there was a humorist lost to literature 
when Frederick Denison Maurice turned his 
face Oxfordward, took holy orders, and devoted 
his energies to Christian Socialism and the 
reformation of a wicked world. Earlier and 
still more sprightly specimens of his literary 
work, put forth in his ' unregenerate ' days, had 
already appeared in 'The Metropolitan Quar- 
terly Magazine,' which he and a student friend 
edited and kept alive for a whole year. It is 
curious, and rather mournful, to find Maurice, 
when long afterward he became professor of 
casuistry and moral philosophy at Cambridge, 
laying open his breast to his young hearers and 
publicly repenting of an extremely clever par- 
ody on Bentham's 'Book of Fallacies' which 
he had printed in that short-lived student jour- 
nal. ' I ought not to have done it,' he solemnly 
declares. ' I showed, by doing it, that I was 
wanting in reverence for grey hairs, and for the 
continuous effort of a man through a long life, 
at the risk of pain, at the cost of pleasure, to effect 
what he thought good for his fellows. If I had 
not been more a victim of his theory [utilitari- 
anism] than he was, I should have paid greater 
honour to him.' But his ' Puritan tempera- 
ment,' as Maurice himself frequently called it 
in his letters, was bound to assert itself; and 
hence the ' twisted, screwed, wiredrawn ' result, 
as viewed by Carlyle. There is said to be extant 
a letter of Maurice's, written at ten years of age, 
which prefigures, by its precocity and self-con- 
sciousness, this phase of the mature man. And 
so we must take him as we find him, even in- 
cluding his torturing of all science and phil- 
osophy into conformity with the Thirty-nine 
Articles. How he contrived to regard the war- 
fare between science and those Articles as a 
concord and not a disagreement, is hard to con- 
ceive. It must have been in a Neo-Platonic 
ecstasy 'of immediate intuition that the har- 
mony revealed itself to him. This reconcilia- 
tion of opposites by removing them to some 
region of four-dimensional mental space, baf- 
fles and bewilders the poor plodder who feels 
constrained to content himself with the possi- 
bilities of space of but three dimensions, and 
may even move him to cry out with Isaiah, 'Woe 
unto them that call evil good, and good evil; 
that put darkness for light, and light for dark- 
ness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for 
bitter ! ' As a brief illustration of Maurice's 
surprising feats in logical gymnastics, his nim- 
bleness in jumping off his own shadow, take his 
defense of religious tests at the universities. By 
some process of reasoning for which he is per- 
haps indebted to Coleridge, whom he so greatly 
reverenced, he arrived at the ' conviction that a

teacher who was not bound by any predeter- 
mined conditions always tied down his pupils 
much more rigidly than one whose conditions of 
teaching were fixed beforehand. He believed 
that all evidence went to show that, both his- 
torically and logically, an undergraduate's sig- 
nature to the Thirty-nine Articles . . . 
implied only that the pupil accepted the Articles 
as presenting the conditions under which he 
was taught. Hence ... he looked upon 
subscription as a defense of liberty.' 

Yet there were occasional incongruities in the 
things of orthodox theology that not even Mau- 
rice's robust faith could harmonize. Leslie 
Stephen quotes with manifest relish the closing 
words of one of his Old Testament lectures. 
Discussing Jacob's shabby treatment of his 
brother Esau, the lecturer, after citing the usual 
apologies, was forced to add: * After all, my 
brethren, this story illustrates the tendency of 
the spiritual man in all ages to be a liar and a 
sneak.' 

It would puzzle a mere reader of Maurice's 
now little-read writings to explain his influence 
and leadership among his fellows. Mr. Saints- 
bury thus places him as a writer and thinker: 
' A very generous and amiable person with a 
deficient sense of history, Maurice in his writ- 
ings is a sort of elder, less gifted, and more 
exclusively theological Charles Kingsley, on 
whom he exercised great and rather unfortunate 
influence. But his looseness of thought, way- 
ward electicism of system, and want of accurate 
learning, were not remedied by Kingsley's splen- 
did pictorial faculty, his creative imagination or 
his brilliant style.' Like Newman, Maurice 
argues to a foregone conclusion. His pages are 
richly suggestive, but his train of thought is 
elusive. He was great not because of, but in 
spite of, his sermons and essays. The man was 
vastly more than his visible performance. He 
was a leader largely because, while worthy of 
a following, he cared so little for the honors of 
leadership, but was always so ready to encounter 
its . dangers and fatigues. ' In more than 
twenty-five years,' writes Charles Kingsley, * I 
have known no being so utterly unselfish, 
so utterly humble, so utterly careless of power 
or influence, for the mere enjoyment — and 
a terrible enjoyment it is — of using them. 
Staunch to his own opinion only when 
it seemed to involve some moral principle, he 
was almost too ready to yield it, in all prac- 
tical matters, to any one whom he supposed to 
possess more practical knowledge than he. To 
distrust himself, to accuse himself, to confess 
his proneness to hard judgment, while, to the 
eye of those who knew him and the facts, he 
was exercising a splendid charity and magna- 
nimity; to hold himself up as a warning of 



" wasted time," while he was, but too literally, 
working himself to death, — this was the child- 
like temper which made some lower spirits now 
and then glad to escape from their consciousness 
of his superiority by patronizing him; causing 
in him — for he was, as all such great men are 
like to be, instinct with genial humour — a cer- 
tain quiet good-natured amusement.' Many of 
these lower spirits held that, as no man could 
possibly be so wise as Thurlow looked, so none 
could be so good as Maurice seemed; and these 
were of the number of his detractors. That he 
could on occasion bravely and cheerfully suffer 
for his faith, his life gave abundant and con- 
vincing evidence. By publishing his * Theo- 
logical Essays,' dealing with the atonement and 
eternal life, he lost his professorship of theology 
in King's College, London. 

Somewhat surprising must it seem that with 
his genius for dissent, his independence of 
thought, and his unfaltering obedience to the 
voice of conscience, he should have entered the 
English Church at the age of twenty-nine, when 
all his training and traditions would appear to 
have pointed him. in another direction. This 
and many other matters must be puzzled out as 
best one can with the help of the excellent biog- 
raphy of the man, compiled chiefly from his 
letters by his son, and published twenty-one 
years ago in two thick volumes, — a veritable 
mine of pleasant reading, along with wire draw- 
ings and paradoxes that are less entertaining. 
Maurice has been dead now a third of a century; 
but this biography, rather than his own books, 
together with the abundant references to him 
that occur in contemporary memoirs, as well as 
Tennyson's lines * To the Eev. F. D. Maurice,' 
will keep his memory green for years to come. 
A few of the Tennyson stanzas may fitly be 
quoted here: 

' For, being of that honest few 
Who give the Fiend himself his due. 

Should eighty thousand college-councils 
Thunder " Anathema," friend, at you ; 

' Should all our churchmen foam in spite 
At you, so careful of the right. 

Yet one lay- hearth would give you welcome 
(Take it and come) to the Isle of Wight. 



' Come, Maurice, come ; the lawn as yet 
Is hoar with rime, or spongy-wet ;

Crocus, anemone, violet, 

' Or later, pay one visit here. 

For those are few we hold as dear ; 

, Nor pay but one, but come for many,

A short and probably familiar anecdote, in 
closing, will perhaps help to convince the 
doubters, if such there be, that his memory is 
well worth preserving. Half a century ago five 
Cambridge men were discussing a receint execu- 
tion, as a preliminary to which the chaplain of

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



AMERICANS AT OXFORD. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Will you permit one of your oldest and most 
faithful readers to raise a question or two as to 
some points in your leading article of July 16,— 
an article certainly entitled to much attention, 
and in many respects admirable, but also perhaps 
suggestive of some criticism*? It is an article 
making comparisons between Englisih and Amer- 
ican universities. 

Let it be said, in advance, that I am not wholly 
ignorant of either class of institutions; having 
been bom in the very shadow of Harvard College, 
of which my father was an officer, and having 
been a member of its examining board for more 
than half a century, and a resident in Cambridge 
for the greater part of my life. Across the ocean, 
I have never been a student at an English uni- 
versity; but I have at four different times visited 
Oxford and Cambridge as a guest, and have had 
many friends and relatives among their students. 
So far as these qualifications entitle to an opinion, 
I should venture to assert that while some of 
your points are well made, you do in other direc- 
tions very great injustice to the American point 
of view. 

Take, for instance, as' one of the slightest, your 
claim that ' the English student works harder at 
his reading during the long vacation than during 
term.] Here you wholly ignore the vast differ- 
ence in summer climates between the countries, 
a difference which makes it absolutely impossible 
for an American student to do bookwork in sum- 
mer to any purpose in our largest libraries,— as 
those at Washington, New York, and Cambridge, 
—and which actually drives him, as I know from 
personal experience (for I habitually work all 
summer), to rural or seaside places, where the 
books he most needs are apt to be inaccessible. 
The English student, on the other hand, can work 
anywhere, without serious obstacles, all the year 
round. 

A more important difference, in looking over 
the points of which you and Mr. Nixon com- 
plain, lies in the fact that the mass of students 
at Oxford are drawn from a picked social class, 



and not, as in America, from the community at 
large. It is hard, in view of this circumstance, 
to regard seriously Mr. Nixon's complaint, seem- 
ingly endorsed by you, that these English youths, 
representing what are or should be cultivated 
families, are more familiar than the young Amer- 
ieansi at Oxford with the names of artists and 
musical composers. Is not this to confound social 
polish with scholastic training? Surely he and 
you must have noticed a similar difference in 
American colleges between city and country boys, 
while yet, tried by the standard of scholarship, 
the country boys are quite as apt to come out 
ahead. If all this is true at home, it is as liable 
to be true of American students who go to Oxford 
by the aid of an educational charity. 

I do not know exactly what the author whom 
you quote means by the American students being 
* silent partners in conversation ' where * gen- 
eral culture ' is concerned. The charge of undue 
silence is so new an imputation upon young Amer- 
icans^ that one hardly knows whether to grieve 
or to rejoice over it. So far as general culture 
involves the use of a variety of languages, it has 
always been a source of wonder to me, on the 
continent of Europe, to see how our English 
cousins, with the immense advantage of the nar- 
rowness of the British channel, yet seem to speak 
the languages of the continent less frequently 
than do Americans of similar social grade. This 
was first forced upon me, some thirty years ago, 
by a remark of the late Lord Houghton, who com- 
plained in my hearing that when a French visitor 
came to him in London, with a letter of introduc- 
tion, he always found it hard to get together half 
a dozen Englishmen who could talk with the guest 
in his own language. The same remark he makes, 
I think, somewhere in his ' Monologues. ' Happen- 
ing to speak of this, some time since, to a Harvard 
professor, he meditated for a moment, and then 
said, 'It would not take me five minutes to think 
of half a dozen American guests to meet, either 
in Cambridge or Boston, a newly-arrived French- 
man, German, Italian, or Spaniard, and to talk 
with him freely in each case in his own language. 
This seems to look much more like what you 
call 'an adequate equipment' than do the points- 
on which you dwell. 

But there is one matter at issue far more impor- 
tant than any of those already mentioned,, or 
indeed than all of them put together. You da 
not even allude to the enormous difference which 
must, and indeed should, exist between English 
and American training, in the fact that the larger 
part of our children's book-knowledge consists,, 
and should consist, in the history and sociology 
of their own country. Every educational institu- 
tion among us, from primary school to university,, 
must needs put these branches first and all else 
later, even as Hans Andersen's motherly hen 
found it her duty to teach her chickens the 
geography of their own barnyard, and after 
scratching it up thoroughly, to look through a 
knot-hole in the neighbor's fence and see how 
large the world was. Here is a direction in which 
the English schoolboy remains not merely in hope-

less ignorance, but with teachers who know quite 
as little; nor can thej', indeed, spare the time to 
know more. Any American who doubts this 
needs only to look about him in the reading-room 
of any London club and see how the smallest 
country newspaper is sure of attentive readers 
if only printed in England, and how few read 
French or German papers, and how surely the 
stray New York 'Nation' or 'Tribune' if there 
be one, has to be hunted up in a comer, where 
only some American guest ever opens it. Such is, 
or at least was, the state of things a few years 
ago, before President Roosevelt had startled even 
English readers into curiosity. Until within a 
few years at least, they seemed at best in the 
mood of the Cambridge (Mass.) schoolgirl who 
complained to her mother, the other day, that she 
did not wish to study American history any more, 
it was 'so cluttered up with Adamses.' 

It happened to me, a quarter of a century ago, 
to be dining with six or eight university men, at 
the table of the one Englishman who is said to 
know more of this country than any other. Talk 
fell upon the ignorance on the part of Englishmen 
of all but three or four American authors; and I, 
to hold my own, had to make a decisive point in 
the game. I called attention to the fact that the 
most eminent of our historians, and the one least 
likely to be superseded, was so absolutely unknown 
in England that probably not a person present, 
except our host, would even recognize his name. 
This being received with a general smile of incre- 
dulity, I gave the name of Francis Parkman ; upon 
which the guests all admitted, with English frank- 
ness, that they had never heard of such a per- 
son,— all. that is, except the youngest of the com- 
pany, who had been for a short time in Wash- 
ington, on the staff of the British minister, and 
who had a vague impression that he had heard 
the name before. It is now nearly twelve years 
since Parkman died, and he is perhaps less abso- 
lutely unknown in England than during the 
greater i^art of his life; but does the class of 
students among whom not only he, but the great 
theme he handled, passed unnoticed, afford an 
adequate school for the whole training of an 
American youth? Grant its vaiue as subsidiary 
training; gi-ant the imequalled charm thrown by 
Professor Butcher, for instance, about Greek and 
Latin studies; yet all this can be transplanted to 
America more easily than one trace of the Ameri- 
can intellectual atmosphere can be transferred to 
England. To lose this is to risk that sense of 
vague homelessness, which was so pathetic in 
Henry James's; lectures this last season, and 
which has recalled in the newspapers that old 
saying that even his cosmopolitanism has its lim- 
itations, since to be truly cosmopolitan one must 
be at home even in his own country.

argument embodied in Colonel Higginson's 
very interesting communication, we feel bound 
to say that our quotation of Mr. Kixon's opin-

ceptance of them as our friendly critic seems 
to imagine. We may also call attention to the 
fact that Colonel Higginson, in. the closing 
paragraphs of his letter, ingeniously shifts the 
question at issue from that of the American 
schoolboy's preparation for college to the very 
different question of the equipment of the edu-

JAPANESE IMPERIAL POETRY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I have occasionally sent you specimens of 
Japanese Imperial Poetry, of which some of the 
latest may be found in your issue of January 1, 
1905. I am now glad to be able to call attention 
to a collection of such poems, made by Prof. 
Arthur Lloyd, of the Imperial University. 
He has recently issued, through the Kinkodo 
Publishing Company, Tokyo, a volume of 159 pages 
with the title of 'Imperial Songs.' These include 
poems, not merely by the Emperor and the Empress, 
the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess, but also 
by other distinguished personages, like Baron 
Takasaki, 'Poet Laureate of Japan.' Most of the 
poems are 'tanka' of only thirty-one syllables; but 
there are also specimens of the 'naga-uta' or long 
poems. The Japanese originals are given on one 
page, and the translations on the opposite pages. 
Professor Lloyd has not attempted to give a literal 
translation of these concise poems, but has exercised 
considerable license in paraphrasing them in such a 
way as to bring out the hidden meaning. He has 
also added occasional notes to explain the purpose 
of a poem or the meaning of an allusion. The 
volume is a valuable contribution to the English 
literature of things Japanese. I append a few 
examples of the poems. 

' Take heed imto thyself ; the mighty God 
That is the Soul of Nature, sees the good 
And bad that man in his most secret heart 
Thinks by himself, and brings it to the light.' 
(Heb Majesty the Bmpsess.) 

' The foe that strikes thee. 

For thy country's sake 
Strike him with all thy might; 

But while thou strikest. 
Forget not still to love him.' 

(His Majestt the Emfebob.) 

' Our cause and aims are righteous, and our arms 

Righteously wielded : — who shall dare resist? ' 

(Babon Takasaki.) 

' On fair Arashi's slopes the rooted pine trees stand. 
So midst the storms and wind, firm-rooted, stands Our 
Land.' 

(H. I. H. THE C5BOWN Pbinck.) 

' The circling year renews itself to-day. 
New entering on the ancient course of months. 
All is renewed, the time-worn sea itself 
Wears a new face to greet the new-bom year. ' 
(H. I. H. THE Cbown Pbikcess.) 

' A sweet perfume is on our Master's sleeve. 
The perfume of the sweetest flower on earth. 
Loyalty, growing in the nation's heart.' 

(Lady Isao Seioenji.) 

This volume by Professor Lloyd is of special 
interest and value because it reflects the thoughts 
and ideals of the Court of Japan.

Ax English Statesman of the 
Old School.* 



There is a noticeable tendency nowadays, on 
the part of over-zealous relatives and friends, 
to inflict upon a long-suffering public intermin- 
able biographies of men whose lives and achieve- 
ments were essentially mediocre. The conven- 
tional two- volume ' Life ^ has thus conie into 
such disrepute that even in the case of a sub- 
ject of such undoubted eminence as the late 
Marquis of Dufferin the reader hesitates before 
plunging into the pages of his formidable-look- 
ing biography. It may be said at once, how- 
ever, that here at least is an exception, and a 
brilliant exception, to the rule which some of us 
would like to see generally enforced against 
monumental biographies. Whether the credit is 
due chiefly to Sir Alfred Lyall, who wrote it, 
or to the inherent qualities of his subject, the 
fact remains that, having once opened the book, 
its six hundred odd pages slip by in a way that 
one generally associates more with a book of 
fiction than of biography. Making every deduc- 
tion for the imperfections inseparable from even 
the best biographies, one reaches the conclusion 
that here a really great subject has been treated 
both adequately and effectively. 

It is one of the chief merits of Sir Alfred 
Lyall's work that he has absolutely possessed 
himself of the great secret of true biography: 
to submerge the biographer's own personality, 
and allow the life of his subject to speak for 
itself. It may seem at first sight an easy task 
to edit the journals and correspondence of a 
great man in such a way as to give a clear, con- 
secutive, and readable account of his life; but 
anyone who has succeeded in producing such 
a biography will give a very different version of 
the difficulties to be overcome. The present 
biographer was fortunate in having access to a 
very extensive mass of private and official corre- 
spondence from and to Lord Dufferin, covering 
most of the periods of his long and eventful 
career; and this correspondence he has worked 
into his narrative with rare skill, discrimina- 
tion, and good taste. 

Few public men have covered so wide a field 
of usefulness as Lord Dufferin. Educated at 
Eton and Oxford, he had scarcely left college 
before he threw himself energetically into the 
strong current of public affairs. Some of his 
earliest activities had to do with the difficult 
problem of the administration of Ireland, and 
from that time to the clos e of his life Lord 

* The Life of the Mahquis of Duffbbin and Ava. 
By Sir Alfred Lyall, P.O. London : John Murray. New 
York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



Dufferin never for a moment wavered in his 
affection for Ireland and her people, nor ceased 
in his efforts to better their condition. 

For some years we find him filling minor 
offices at Court and in the Government, presid- 
ing over several important Eoyal commissions, 
taking an active part in the deliberations of 
Parliament, travelling everywhere in Europe, 
and carrying on always a correspondence witli 
his hosts of friends in and out of public life, 
which throws a clear light upon a personality 
which was in so many ways remarkable and 
attractive. Perhaps nowhere else does one get a 
better conception of his true character than in 
Lord Dufferin's letters to his mother, that bril- 
liant daughter of the Sheridans. The warmth 
of his affection for his mother shines through all 
the early pages of his life, and it was as beau- 
tifully commemorated in the famous Helen's 
Tower, dedicated to her use while she lived, and 
to her memory thereafter. Everyone knows 
Tennyson's lines, so perfectly appropriate to 
the theme, as Tennyson well knew how to 
make them, — * nervous, granite-like words,' as 
Lord Dufferin himself described them. 

' Helen's Tower, here I stand, 
Dominant over sea and land. 
Son's love built me^ and I hold 
Mother's love in lettered gold. 
Would my granite girth were strong 
As either love, to last as long. 
I should wear my crown entire 
To and thro' the Doomsday Are, 
And be found of angel eyes 
In earth's recurring Paradise.' 

But one cannot do better than quote Lord 
Dufferin's own tribute to this remarkable wo- 
man, from whom he derived many of the charac- 
teristics which he describes in her. 

'Thus there went out of the world' (he says) 
'one of the sweetest, most beautiful, most accom- 
plished, wittiest, most loving, and lovable human 
beings that ever walked upon the earth. There was 
no quality wanting to her perfection; and I say 
this, not prompted by the partiality of a son, but 
as one well acquainted with the world, and with 
both men and women. There have been many 
ladies who have been beautiful, charming, witty, 
and good, but I doubt whether there have been 
any who have combined with so high a spirit, and 
with so natural a gaiety and bright an imagina- 
tion as my mother's, such strong unerring good 
sense, tact, and womanly discretion; for these last 
characteristics, coupled with the intensity of her 
affections, were the real essence and deep founda- 
tions of my mother's nature.' 

With such a mother, one need not wonder that 
the son developed into a true, honorable, and 
manly man, a warm and steadfast friend, a 
charming companion, a brilliant, broad-minded 
and patriotic statesman. 

We now reach the point in Lord Dufferin's 
career where he entered upon what might be 
called the upper plane of public life. In 1873 
he was appointed Governor General of Canada,

one of the highest and most important offices in 
the gift of the British Crown. Six years later 
he returned to England, and after a very brief 
visit to Clandeboye, his Irish home, went to 
St. Petersburg as Ambassador to the Court of 
the Czar. It is interesting to note, as a remark- 
able tribute to Lord Dufferin's standing as a 
diplomat and statesman that although then and 
always a staunch Liberal he was sent to St. 
Petersburg by Lord Beaconsfield, as the only 
man for the place, at a peculiarly trying and 
critical moment. 

Upon his return from St. Petersburg, his 
knowledge of the intricate problems of the Near 
East, gained in connection with an earlier mis- 
sion to Syria, and through extensive travels in 
Egypt, pointed him out as the man for the 
vacant ambassadorship to Constantinople, where 
a strong diplomat was badly needed to uphold 
British prestige and steer the Sultan through 
the rocks of Oriental intrigue. 

In 1884, Lord Dufferin accepted the office 
of Viceroy of India, an office which he filled 
with most conspicuous success. The intricate 
and delicate problems of Indian administration, 
the annexation of Burmah, the relations with 
Afghanistan, the menacing advance of Eussia 
toward the northwest boundary, were all han- 
dled with consummate skill. It is worth noting 
that Lord Dufferin was equally successful in two 
such radically different offices as the Viceroyalty 
of India and the Governor Generalship of Can- 
ada; the former corresponding in a measure to 
an absolute, the latter to a constitutional mon- 
archy. In India he had to rely in large measure 
upon his own judgment in the administration of 
the domestic affairs of the great dependency, 
while in both domestic and foreign affairs he 
was hampered by the cumbrous machinery of 
the India Office and the Foreign Office at Home. 
In Canada, on the other hand, he had no direct 
control of the government of the country, and 
had to rely upon his own native shrewdness, his 
close knowledge of human nature, and the com- 
pelling power of his personality, to achieve those 
ends which he deemed essential to the best inter- 
ests of both the Dominion and the British Em- 
pire. Here again one may note the admirable 
skill with which he handled the very difficult 
situation created by what was known in Cana- 
dian politics as the Pacific Scandal, involving the 
temporary downfall of the great Canadian 
statesman. Sir John Macdonald, and his gov- 
ernment. 

Of his ambassadorship at Eome, and after- 
ward at Paris, there is not space to say anything 
here. In 1896 he retired definitely from public 
life, to the great regret of the Queen, the gov- 
ernment, and the country. 

Of the generosity of Lord Dufferin's nature 



and the warmth of his Irish heart, we get a 
last glimpse in his much-quoted letter to Lord 
Salisbury, written two days before his death : 

'I do not think you ever knew how much 1 
liked you. . . . This is all that I have strength 
to say. Good-bye, and God bless you.' 

The warm personal friendship which could 
subsist between two such strong political oppo- 
nents as Lord Dufferin and Lord Salisbury is 
one of the finest characteristics of British poli- 
tics, and one which might well be emulated on 
this side of the Atlantic, both north and south 
of the international boundary.

Bulgarian and Roumaxiax 
Folk-songs.* 



That the interest in folk-songs and folk-lore 
is reviving is evidenced by the appearance of 
two new volumes in which have been gathered 
songs and stories that have come from the hearts 
of two neighboring nations, Bulgaria and Kou- 
mania. They appeal to us because in them we 
find the love, the aspirations, the anguish, the 
mysteries of the human soul. They are the 
wild-flowers of human nature. 

Among all the collectors of Bulgarian folk- 
songs, the three most important have been 
Petko Slaveikoff, Stephen Verkovich, and 
Dmitri Miladinoff. After Slaveikoff's death, an 
enormous number of unprinted folk-songs wa* 
found among his papers. Many of these have 
since been published in the collections of other 
men. It was he who wrote down the epic songs 
of Marco which were printed by the Eussian 
Academy of Science in 1855. His greatest 
work was, however, the collection and publica-

THE DIAIi 



[August 1, 



1874-82, and he alleges that like the Bohemian 
Hanka, who discovered his own poems in the 
vaults of the church-tower of Koniginhof, so 
did Yerkovich find in the Ehodope Mountains a 
colossal and most amazing seam of poetry. I 
have no means of verifying or refuting this 
accusation. 

Perhaps the best collection of Bulgarian folk- 
songs is that of Dmitri Miladinoff and his 
brother, which was published in 1861 through 
the munificence of Dr. Strossmayer, who has 
been Bishop of Djakovo in Croatia for more 
than fifty-five years. ' The Shade of the Bal- 
kans ' is now dedicated to this generous man. 
Since the days of these famous collectors, 
twenty-one volumes of Bulgarian folk-songs 
have been published, and the ' Sbornik,' a jour- 
nal of folk-lore, science, and literature, issued 
by the Bulgarian Minister of Education, con- 
tinues to be a storehouse for songs and other 
folk-lore. 

' The Shade of the Balkans ' is divided into 
three parts: ^The Folk-Song of the Bulgars,' 
by Mr. Pencho Slaveikoff; 'The Shade of the 
Balkans,^ which includes one hundred and one 
songs, one hundred and one proverbs, and 
appendix and notes, by Mr. Henry Bernard; 
and ' The Origin and Language of the Primi- 
tive Bulgars,' by Mr. E. J. Dillon. The intro- 
duction has been written by Mr. Bernard. 

It has not been possible for students to estab- 
lish a tenable theory as to the exact birthplace 
of the Bulgarian folk-songs, but two serious 
attempts have been made, and each one places 
the origin in Macedonia. Without accepting 
these theories, Mr. Slaveikoff divides Bulgaria 
into three song-provinces, and maintains that 
the north and the south are the chief sources 
of the heiduck songs, the Rhodope Mountains, 
up to the river Vardar, of the love-songs, and 
western Bulgaria and Macedonia, beyond the 
Vardar, of the hero songs ; and he finds no truth 
in the assertion that the songs of northern Bul- 
garia, when contrasted with songs from other 
parts fall short in poetical power, and that in 
general the natives of the north are less richly 
endowed with power than their southern kins- 
men. But in northern Bulgaria new folk-songs 
are being created under the immediate influence 
of artistic poetry ; this is due to the reawakening 
of Bulgarian culture, and is the herald of grave 
changes in the very character of the folk-song, 
Mr. Slaveikoff says. The author draws atten- 
tion to the fact that the motive and the subject 
of Bulgarian folk-songs often show evidence of 
venerable age. The following fragment, for 
instance, reminds one very forcibly, he thinks, 
of the goddess who undertook to procure a new 
shield for the Homeric heroes : 



' The witch knew that a sword was ia Stamboul, 

A hero-sword that Marko must possess, 

She leaped upon her brown, swift-running deer. 

Dark adders did she seize upon for reins 

And for the stirrups fiercely-shining adders, 

While for the whip she swung a yellow snake. 

And so she whirled along to buy the sword.' 

Such similarities are common, and they seem to 
indicate a close connection with the songs of 
classic Greece. 

The chief characteristic of these songs, as of 
all folk-songs, is objectiveness. In this they 
differ from artistic poetry. In some of them we 
find a rather severe mode of expression, which is 
reflected in the general tone. The form is more 
or less varied, and the division into strophes is 
usual. Their purely outward characteristics are 
the lack of rhyme and the peculiar rhythm. 
The rhythm is multifarious and highly elastic, 
Mr. Slaveikoff says ; and it does not adapt itself 
to the usual pronunciation of the words, but to 
the number of syllables, with one or more inter- 
mediate accents according to which the verses 
are divided into rhythmical parts. Each verse 
contains from four to fourteen syllables, and is 
divided into two or four rhythmical parts. In 
the hero songs the prevailing verse has ten sylla- 
bles, in nearly all others eight syllables. 

A passage in Mr. Bernard's Introduction 
describes the peculiar method of selecting the 
songs in this book : 

'This is the process which each of them under- 
went: after Slaveikoff had given a discursive and 
charmingly allusive translation into German, we 
debated — not always, I confess, without ferocity — 
as to whether we should include it. If the objec- 
tions were overcome Slaveikoff gave a more accu- 
rate rendering and in order that I should preserve 
the metre, with its accentuation, he spoke in Bul- 
garian various lines which I took down pho- 
netically. But, apart from the limits of language, 
it is a perilous affair to translate the half-lights 
and subtleties of poetry, and one of the para- 
mount joys of our work was the result of our limi- 
tations. Whenever we came to a passage that was 
at all recondite, we set about the conquest of it 
by means of metaphor and illustrative anecdote 
and fearless flights of the imagination.' 

This is in sharp contrast with Mile. Yacaresco's 
method of collecting folk-songs and legends for 
her book. 

The following selections represent the differ- 
ent varieties of songs : 

' The wind is blowing over the fields. 

But out of my heart it sweeps not the darkness. 

I would that a wind should be made of my sighs, 

That it would speed over mountain and valley, 

And it will surely find my beloved. 

It will sing him a desolate song. 

It will sing till he thinks of me.' 

' Sore, sore afflicted was Nicholas the Tartar, 
Nine endless years had he lain in bed, 
In among his hair grew the grass already. 
While a swarm of flies buzzed within his ears, 
And from his body many worms were crawling. 
He could not be cured, neither could tie die.'

' Dear Ivan, listen to me. 

Listen and do as I sar. 

First find a good, strong sack. 

Place in it thy sorrows and mine. 

Then plough the field of thy father 

And sow our sorrows therein. 

If they give birth to a rose 

We'll ask for the marriage-bell. 

But if a nettle comes forth 

We must bid each other farewell.' 

' The wood did neither weave nor spin 
For through the winter she was ill. 
But when it was Saint George's Day, 
The joyous festival of spring. 
She was arrayed in finished robes. 
In finished robes of emerald.' 

The proverbs have been taken without excep- 
tion from Mr, Petko Slaveikoflfs two volumes 
previously mentioned. Some of the most inter- 
esting follow: 

'Onlv the nightingale can understand the rose.' 
'Woman desires three husbands at once: one 
rich, one comely, one fierce, — to support her, to 
love her, to beat her.' 

'The smaller saints will be the ruin of God.' 
'The clergyman's son is the devil's grandson.' 
'Death speaks the truth.' 

In the proverbs, as a whole, there is mirrored, 
according to the opinion of Mr. Pencho Slavei- 
koff, more than anywhere else that extremity of 
individualism which so sharply differentiates the 
Bulgarian from his neighbors, and his brood- 
ing undemonstrative character crops out here 
and there. In not a few there is something to 
justify Mr. Slaveikoff^s regrettable assertion 
that ' there is little in. married life save toil and 
torment and tribulation.' 

Basing his arguments upon the work of Mr. 
Shishmanov, Mr. Dillon concludes, in the third 
section of the book, that Bulgar means * Volga 
man,' and he says it is manifest, consequently, 
that this people must have dwelt on the shores 
of the Volga before their division into two 
branches, and it is equally clear that they lived 
there for a long period before that event. 

The book contains much of great interest, but 
we deplore the evident hasty preparation, the 
newspaper style, the immoderate tone, the preju- 
dice, and above all the unwarranted and undig- 
nified attack upon the work of ' Carmen Sylva ' 
and Mile. Vacaresco, who have performed a 
really noble service in presenting to the world 
the beautiful folk-songs of Eoumania ; they have 
done for that country what Professor T. F. 
Crane has done for Italy. Mr. Slaveikoff, for 
instance, speaking of ' The Bard of the Dimbo- 
vitza," a collection of songs published by Mile. 
Vacaresco with the collaboration of the Queen 
of Eoumania, makes the amazing charge that 
they are * manufactured songs,' that ' the Rou- 
manian peasant has not the remotest idea of 
these songs,' and that they are * nothing more 
than a fabrication of the Merry Wives of 
Bucharest.' We can understand the fierceness 



of such an accusation when we read Mr. Ber- 
nard's characterization of his collaborator in the 
Introduction : 

* Slaveikoff is the caged lion of Sofia. Great, 
massive shoulders, a massive head, swarthy with 
beard of black and silver (though the poet is 
under forty), a brow that sets one thinking, and 
eyes - — eyes weary with the world 's trouble, dark- 
iLig eyes, eyes of the twilit woods, then of a wood- 
land faun, eyes that lure you and dance away 
from you, eyes that laugh at you and their owner, 
unbearable eyes. Slaveikoff is the figure of revolt.' 

But we are touched with a feeling of generosity 
toward Mr. Slaveikoff by a communication from 
Mr. Bernard in which he says: * For the sake of 
unity and convenience, I put all the denuncia- 
tion of Miss V. into Slaveikoff's mouth at the 
conclusion of his essay in our book. As a mat- 
ter of fact, I collected the various items from 
him and from others.' And this essay is pre- 
sumably by Mr. Slaveikoff, and is signed by 
him, and yet a part of it, on Mr. Bernard's own 
admission, is a compilation by himself. Such 
a procedure casts suspicion upon the whole book. 

There can, of course, be no real doubt as to 
the authenticity of the songs published by Mile. 
Vacaresco and subscribed to by ' Carmen Sylva.' 
It is indeed preposterous that a reigning Queen 
of the noble character of Elisabeth of Roumania 
should be allowed by her subjects to sign an 
assertion which might be declared false any day. 
Carmen Sylva went to Roumania in her youth, 
and for more than twenty-five years she has 
studied the soul of the Roumanian peasants and 
the folk-lore of the land. Helene Vacaresco is a 
maid of honor to this Queen, a member of the 
highest aristocracy, a daughter of a former 
minister plenipotentiary, and at least two of 
her books have been crowned by the French 
Academy, one being the very work condemned 
by the authors of * The Shade of the Balkans,' 
and it was recommended to the Academy by one 
of the greatest French authorities on the sub- 
ject, M. Gaston Paris. M. Andre Bellessort, 
who has recently published in the * Revue des 
Deux Mondes' a series of articles on his two 
years' study and travel in Roumania, is led to 
quote Mile. Vacaresco's works as the best expres- 
sion of what he saw and admired. All these 
facts vouch for their honesty and integrity, and 
certainly they are worthy of respectful treat- 
ment. It appears, though, as if the authors of 
'The Shade of the Balkans' were trying to 
draw attention to their own work by decrying 
the work of others. As a further example, Mr. 
Bernard published in the London ' Bookman ' 
for April a sarcastic review of Mile. Vacaresco's 
' Songs of the Valiant Voivode,' at the same 
time speaking of a part of his own book as 
' brilliant.' In reading ' The Shade of the Bal-

kans ' I have not felt the pious sensation expe- 
rienced by another reviewer, about whom Mr. 
Bernard reports that ' he feels he might as well 
review the Bible.' Indeed, 'the smaller saints 
will be the ruin of God ' ! I recommend to the 
authors another of their proverbs : 

* That from your life the sourness may depart 
You must have sweetness come into your heart.' 

' Songs of the Valiant Voivode/ as stated on 
the title-page, were collected among the Rou- 
manian peasants. In a personal letter, Mile. 
Vacaresco reaflfirms this assertion, and says that 
many of these songs were told to her by the 
servants in her father's house, by an old gar- 
dener, and by a nurse. The following quota- 
tions from the dedicatory epistle to her cousin 
breathe the spirit of the book : 

'These tales and 'legends of our dear country 
belong to you by right of inheritance and by birth- 
right too. For months I have wandered from 
village to village and gathered the strange sweet 
stories; they grow like flowers in the wide domains 
that bear our name. . . . You know how pecu- 
liarly proud and graceful is the stature of a Kou- 
manian peasant against the golden sky of our 
native land, and how much he still retains in his 
mind and his words the love of imaginative crea- 
tion of symbols, and of song.' 

The titles of some of the most characteristic 
songs and stories are : ' The Enchanted Palace 
Between the Enchanted Trees,' 'The White 
Serpent and the Little Beggar Girl,' ' The Wil- 
lows' Daughter,' ' The Fairy and the Waterfall,' 
'Thisca,' 'The Church-builder.' There are 
many others that are equally beautiful, and in 
nearly all the genuine flavor of the folk-song 
is easily detected. The opening lines of the 
story of Dragomira are touching in their sweet 
simplicity : 

'Dragomira was the sweetest and fairest girl 
in the village; she loved God, the sunlight, and 
the birds; she tended all the living and frail 
creatures that came across her, and her heart, was 
as clear and bright as the crystal beads of her 
necklace and the new-born flowers she wore every 
morning in her hair. Yet Dragomira died one even- 
ing when there was neither sun nor moon to mourn 
over her in the sky, when all the little birds were 
asleep. * 

The introductory lines to the song about the 
Moldavian Princess and the fairy make their 
appeal through delicate feeling: 

' I have come to the well, and though my pitcher's full 

I'll not return till I see the moon rise, 

Because the sweet moon when she rises 

Sometimes relates a tale to me, 

And I love the tales of the moon. 

For the moon sees the hearts of maidens and their tears, 

Even more than the sun. 

I love the tales of the moon, 

For the moon travels far and yet always returns 

To her place in the sky. 

For the moon looks on cradles and looks on graves 

With the same smile. 

Ah ! I love the tales of the moon. 

This tale the moon hath told, which I will tell to thee.' 



Note the imagery in the lines from the story 
about Hie and Pauna : 

'Pauna, the fair daughter of the Voivode, was 
sitting in the moonlight on the banks of the river, 
her spindle in her hand, her distaff in her belt, 
while the maidens around her filled the silvery 
hours with tales of valour and love. A wandering 
shepherd's flute was heard from the neighboring 
hill, and the water laughed and sighed by turns 
as it glided at their feet beneath the tall reeds. 
The maidens who sat around the young Princess 
were twelve maidens fair, but fairer than Pauna 
was none as she listened to their words, and sighed 
and laughed by turns like the water between the 
reeds. ' 

An explanation of the differences between 
these Roumanian songs and legends and the 
Bulgarian songs may be found in the differences 
between the two nations. A few of the Rou- 
manian pieces display love of battle and of 
blood; but on the whole, as compared with the 
Bulgarian songs, the Roumanian show more 
simplicity, more poetic sympathy with nature, 
more sensitiveness to music, and more joy in an 
ideal of justice and of beauty.

The Japanese People and tue 
Japanese Spirit.* 

Dr. Scherer's ' Story of the Japanese People ' 
is a companion book to his ' Japan To-Day ' 
issued a few months ago. Naturally attracted 
to the educational side of his subject by reason 
of his having been for five years teacher in one 
of the government schools of Japan he looks at 
this young nation's early culture, adolescence, 
and modern school-days, and ever with a criti- 
cal eye. It is not at all certain that Dr. Scherer 
prefers the Japanese to the Chinese; and his 
fairness in discriminating the faults and the 
virtues of either race gives his writing judicial 
value. Aesthetics set over against ethics, love 
of beauty as contrasted with the more solid 
virtues of character, sentimentalism as opposed 
to conservatism, are what he sees in the age-long 
drama of the Far East. No special acquain- 
tance with the originals of Japanese thought, in 
archaeology, history, literature, or the currents 
of the modem philosophy of Japan, is noted on 
these pages ; but Dr. Scherer has read and quotes 
the authors whose research and critical insight 
are manifest. The dark shadows in the picture 
of modern Japan are dwelt upon by one who 
knows the reality away from which such writers

as Heam and Arnold so sedulously direct our 
attention. ' The two cancers at the core of the 
Japanese character are deep-set dishonesty and 
abandoned impurity.' The sale of daughters 
by their parents for immoral purposes under the 
guise of ' filial piety ' and licensed prostitution 
as a source of government revenue, are still 
* institutions/' even while the five noble qualities 
of the Japanese character — bravery, loyalty, 
alertness, thoroughness and self-control, — 
charm the world. With Ito as exponent of 
Japan's purely cultural creed, and Okuma's 
plea that the Biblical type of noble life will 
never be out of date, the author concludes that 
the present is the critical period of this sturdy 
young nation's life. Shall Okuma's advice to 
welcome the Christian missionaries and their 
book and message, or Ito's, to accept the ma- 
terialism of the West and virtually ignore its 
religions, be taken? Upon the answer to this 
question, says Dr. Scherer, depends the future 
manhood of Japan. The style of the book is 
clear, straightforward, and marked by ease and 
poise. It is the book for the hour; for the 
chief problems about Japan just now concern 
her real purpose and moral force. 

It is a good thing for Japan, standing as the 
vanguard of Asia, to have native as well as alien 
interpreters. Heretofore, strangers who see but 
the surface of things have been rather voluble 
in explaining to the world the causes and mean- 
ing of the re-birth of Japan. Xow, however, we 
have sons of the soil speaking of these matters 
with authority. Already a respectable company 
of Japanese writers of English are uttering their 
plea and defense, their vindication and explana- 
tion, — Nitobe, Suyematsu, Kaneko, Adachi, 
and the Okakura brothers. One of these lat- 
ter, Kakuzo, has written on * The Awakening of 
Japan,' and the other, whose work is now under 
review, has essayed to unveil the mysteries and 
potencies of the Japanese spirit. This book is 
not so strong or original as * The Awakening of 
Japan,' but it seems to do more justice to the 
work and influence of Buddhism as the mother 
and nurse of Japanese civilization. The Intro- 
duction, by Mr. George Meredith, need not con- 
cern an American very seriously, though Mr. 
Meredith shows that the foolish talk of the Yel- 
low Peril is, inthe light of the revelations of this 
work, simply fatuous. These ' Spartans in fight. 
Stoics in grief ' will not be inflated to the point 
of insanity by the success of their arms. 

This book owes its existence to the suggestions 
of Mr. Martin White, whose keen interest in 
comparative sociology led to the opening of 
special courses for its investigation in the Uni- 
versity of London. In its literary form, it is 
the reproduction and expansion of the lecture 
delivered there by its author, it having no table 



of contents -or index, the matter forming in 
itself one uninterrupted chapter. 

After naming some of the scholars who have 
helped the Japanese both to know and tc 
express themselves, the author passes on to the 
question of the origin of his people. Like most 
tfapanese, he will not acknowledge the Ainu, a 
straight-eyed and big-nosed white race, whose 
hairiness has been somewhat exaggerated, to be 
in part progenitors of the present Japanese 
race. He does not seem to be acquainted with 
the researches of Dr. Batchelor, who finds in 
the Ainu language (not * Aino,' which means 
dog's offspring) a near relative to the Aryan 
family. American ladies will be sorry to learn, 
what nevertheless is entirely true, that straight 
eyes and eyebrows make a very bad impression 
on the Japanese, suggesting weakness, lasciv- 
iousness, and so on. Blue eyes and blond hair 
are extraordinary, in no favorable sense of the 
term. Brief and on the whole brilliant analyses 
of the original mental pabulum of the Japan- 
ese, as furnished by Confucianism, Taoism, and 
Buddhism, are given; but the author frankly 
confesses, what all students know, that the Jap- 
anese are not a people with much aptitude for 
deep metaphysical ways of thinking. No Kant 
or Schopenhauer is likely to be produced in 
Japan, where even the leaders have the easy 
contentment of men of action. The canon of 
Buddhism has never been translated into the 
vernacular, and the abstruse conceptions of 
India and China were received just as they 
were preached, being quickly generalized and 
turned into so many working principles. In a 
word, the Japanese are a very practical, matter- 
of-fact people. Even true ancestor-worship, — 
though the author does not acknowledge it, — ^is 
of Chinese, not native, origin. Imported from 
China, this cult was immediately turned into a 
political engine. The author shows many signs 
of having read Xitobe well. He acknowledges 
Japan's large indebtedness to the Zen sect of 
Buddhism, especially in treating of Bushido, 
which he exploits handsomely. It is most 
delightful and refreshing to find a Japanese 
writer who, while stalwart in maintaining 
Yamato Damashii (really Japanese wit, not 
Yalor, rather than Chinese learning), winds up 
with a sentence like this : * We feel it a most 
agreeable duty gratefully to acknowledge our 
immense obligation to the nations of the West.'

Recent American Poetry.* 



The ' Poems, Lyric and Dramatic ' of Miss 
Ethel Louise Cox are of singularly fine quality. 
We will begin to justify this assertion by quot- 
ing the lyric called * Sleep.' 

' Soft fall upon mine eyelids, gentle Sleep, 

Like rain of roses ! though I wake to weep, 

Quiet my heart ! 

' Bring on thy wings that peace that day denies, 

The dewy balm that with the morrow flies ; 

And then depart ! 

' Love hath its own sweet joy and dear delight : 

And Thought its aery blisses, fancy light ! 

Dearer thou art ! ' 

The inspiration of this song seems to come 
from Shelley, and it is of him that we are 
reminded upon many other pages, particularly 
on those that contain a * Prometheus ' fragment 
in dramatic form. Thus for example, speaks 
the Voice of the Earth in the poem just named : 

' Within my dreams I stir ! I hear afar 

Aerial voices singing ! tones divine ! 

Yet heard I, trembling to my shuddering heart, 

An awful voice of anguish ! agony 

Of him born of my fertile bosom, loved 

Of Earth, the Titan. O let me no more 

Those fearful murmurs hearken from the heights. 

The solitary mountains ! Keener grows 

The ancient pain of Earth !' 

This extract, besides being an echo of Shelley, 
also illustrates the author's predilection for 
classical themes, which are predominant among 
those of which she sings. And we find in some 
of these classical studies many signs of the 
influence of still another poet — not a greater, 
but one more difficult of imitation. Here are 
the closing verses of the poem entitled ' Lethe ' :

'Sighs 
Shook the pale lilies at her breast ; once more 
She raised the dewy cup within her palms. 
The limped water sparkled at its brim, 
" Drink ! " said she softly — then tears fell within 
The chalice, mingling with the crystal draught !' 

This has the very accent of Landor, and might 
easily pass for an extract from the * Hellenics.' 
The pure and wistful Landorian note is sus- 
tained in many of these pieces, which reproduce 
in really wonderful fashion his classic grace and 
restraint, with its sense of evanescent beauty 
and of * tears in mortal things.' ' Persephone 
in Hades ' is not too long for us to quote. 

'Drooping upon her throne, Persephone 
Eyed with dim looks the brooding darkness near ; 
And heard the river eddies rippling led 
To misty banks of amaranth and pale 
Lilies of faint Elysium ; and her heart 
Passioned for meads of Enna, flower-sweet ! 
Young buds, and dewy flowers, and the dome 
Of the blue skies, the faint star of the morn, 
Clear drops of dew, the song of soaring birds 
In the white dawn, and odor-breathing winds ; 
Dreaming, she listened for voices of nymphs 
In pleasant vales, and river lawns. Beside 
Her, leaned dark Pluto, and his trembling words 
Whispered her close and sweet, were all unheard ; 
With promise of fair flowers as she lost 
'Neath kinder skies — rose leaf and daffodil ! 
Of all the splendors of the halcyon earth — 
So she would lift her fainting head ! and 'neath 
His kiss, the last flower clinging to her locks — 
Sole coronal of lone Persephone ! 
Fell, with a shower of loose, odorous leaves.' 

We must make one more quotation, not this 
time to illustrate a thesis, but simply for the 
sake of the beauty embodied in these verses on 
' Mutability.' 

'We prize but what we lose ! Could the spring stay. 
With its pure skies, perfumes, and rose, alway. 
Nor burn to summer bright — stayed that fair star, 
A-tremble in the evening hush afar. 
Fixed in mild splendor in the purple sky ! 
Would our hearts leap with the May morn? or sigh 
With passion for that one white sphere? so fair, 
O youth, wild white swan of Life's sea ! would'st e'er 
Be, if we knew not that on some green day 
Thou would'st flee far, on faery seas away. 
To visionary lands, and meadows deep 
In fabled asphodel, and mists of sleep?' 

The inclusion by Miss Cox of the word 'dra- 
matic ' in the title of her book would be justified 
by the classical poems alone, many of which 
are dramatic in spirit if not in form. But a 
more literal justification is offered by the 
lengthy dramatic scene of *The Combat with 
the Dragon' which closes the collection. This 
work, however, is much less impressive than the 
poems which precede it in what must, taken as 
a whole, be considered a noteworthy volume of 
verse, 

* The Shoes That Danced, and Other Poems,' 
by Miss Anna Hempstead Branch, is the sec- 
ond collection of verse published by this writer. 
The somewhat singular title of the volume 
belongs to the opening piece, which is a dra- 
matic sketch in blank verse of unusual quality, 
havinff Watteau for its central figure. Miss

Branch's work exhibits a mind saturated with 
English poetry — particularly its naive older 
forms — and prettily echoes a variety of man- 
ners. It is touched with mysticism, and has 
considerable imaginative reach. Many of the 
pieces are marred by obscurity and an obvious 
straining for effect. A few verses from ' Under 
the Trees ' may be quoted: 

' The wonderful, strong, angelic trees. 

With their blowing locks and their bared great knees 

And nourishing bosoms, shout all together 

And rush and rock through the glad wild weather. 

' They are so old they teach me. 
With their strong hands they reach me. 
Into their breast my soul they take. 
And keep me there for wisdom's sake. 

* They teach me little prayers ; 
To-day I am their child ; 
The sweet breath of their innocent airs 
Blows through me strange and wild. 

' So many things they know, 

So learned with the ebb and flow 

By which the seasons come and go. 

Still the forefather stands 

With unforgetting eyes. 

Forever holding in his tranquil hands 

The fruit that makes us wise.' 

Miss Edith Colby Banfield, whose brief life 
came to an end two years ago, had published a 
few poems in the magazines, but the bulk of the 
work now collected into a volume was left in 
manuscript. These poems have been published 
just as they were found among her papers, and, 
in spite of the lack of polish which marks some 
of them, they are deserving of this perpetua- 
tion. How high was the writer's ideal may be 
seen in the sonnet called *In PoetrVs High 
Tower.' 

' Up in this belfry tower of poetry 

I flee disquiet and the vexing things 

Left far and dim below. 'Mid fluttering wings 

I overlook the city under me, 

I see the morning break upon the sea. 

And watch the westward spires where evening clings : 

Yea, this old bell, obedient that rings, 

I even waken, halt and tremblingly. 

Could I but ring it as blind Milton rung. 

I would not need to see the morning light; 

What sounds would issue from its mighty tongue. 

More strong than death, more comforting than sight ! 

Ah. let no weakling think he can regain 

One single peal of that triumphant strain ! ' 

Since a full half of Miss Banfield's work con- 
sists of sonnets, we will quote another poem in 
this form, to illustrate the simple sincerity of 
her work, and its directness of expression. 
'Land and Sea' is the title. 

* Unto His peoples God hath given the land. 

And there allows their petty ownerships. 

Their little acres and asundered strips 

Of titled earth, whereon their homes may stand ; 

But He the sea reserveth in His hand. 

And all the waters thereunto that flow; 

The ships thereon are free to come and go 

By His sole sufferance ; strand to farthest strand 

The continents like documents reveal 

Man's superscription and his countersign 

Traced on them legibly from line to line; 

But like a hidden scroll the sea doth bear 

The single stamp of Gods great signet-seal 

Xor could he break it, who should even dare ! ' 



Miss Pattie Williams Gee's ' The Palace of 
the Heart, and Other Poems of Love ' is a thin 
volume of short pieces inspired mainly by relig- 
ious fervor. A set of couplets called ' Pax 
Vobiscum ' may serve us for an example. 

' If I could know your heart's supreme desire. 

If I could pierce through Its devouring Are, 

Where this, unscorched, lies quivering, white and clear, 

Its consummation would I wish you, dear. 

But since these eyes may not behold the place 

Which shrines your anguish — nor the void space. 

The empty chamber, flame-swept, phantom- wrought. 

For which your soul has bargained, sold and bought. 

Take thou the yearning of my own heart's core : — 

God's soundless peace enfold you evermore, 

Soothing the troubled Presence with its balm. 

Filling the empty chamber with Its calm ! — 

Such peace be yours, dear, while the evening nears. 

Sweetening and deepening with the dying years ! ' 

A rather striking poem, different in theme 
from the others, is the ' Mater Mea Carolina,' 
which celebrates the heroism and devotion of 
North Carolina during the Civil War. 

We have at hand another of the charming 
little books, published in limited editions, into 
which Mr. Clinton Scollard collects his poems. 
There are more than a dozen of these volumes 
altogether, and the production of the poet 
flows on with sustained energy. The present 
book contains longer pieces than usual. They 
are oalles ' Odes and Elegies,' and are seven in 
number. One of them, a Phi Beta Kappa trib- 
ute to the memory of General Lawton, yields for 
quotation this fine passage : 

' Many there be who watch with grievM eyes. 
And brows aflush with shame. 
What they deem sacrilege in freedom's name. 
And the mad warping of our destinies ; 
Feeling no thrill exultant In them rise, 
Howe'er beneath the sultry Luzon skies 
Our armies triumph, but a sense of blame. 
If ours the trespass, even as we sowed. 
And still are sowing, shall the reaping be ! 
But who can follow this swift warrior's road. 
Resistless as the surge of the gray sea. 
And not l>e moved that we can claim the man 
As type of what we name — ^American ! 
And ah, the blinding pity of it all. 
If we be smirching with a guilty red 
The purity of Liberty's fountain-head. 
That through our error such an one should fall ! ' 

* The Dreamers ' is the opening poem in this 
collection, and one of the best, although to our 
thinking too liberally sprinkled with indiscrim- 
inately-chosen proper names. To this *The 
March of the Ideal' is a companion ode. Of 
another, President McKinley is the subject, and 
Keats of still another. The remaining two, 
' The Stars of Morning,' and ' The Oriskany ' 
are nature-poems in their main inspiration. Mr. 
Scollard's work sometimes seems labored, but 
he has imagination and lofty idealism for fairly 
steadfast companions, and they prompt him to 
an utterance which is usually worthy of his 
theme. 

The following sonnet, entitled * Sea Burial,' 
is selected from * The First Wardens,' a volume 
of poems by Mr. William J. Neidig :

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



' A winding sheet, a broadside for the brave, 

A light on the blue sea one Instant known, 

A work unfinished — Where his dust was strewn 

Is no more battle. Sea-moss shades his grave; 

Coolness of coral spans his pearl-strewn cave ; 

Nor Pharaoh's vaults more deaf to the sands blown. 

Nor silk cocoons more soft in Maytlme grown, 

Before the summer frees the textile slave ! 

O give me. Star, my rest beneath the sea ! 

There let me He, and let the deaf swells roll, 

Or craggy cliffs, like belfries wild and free. 

In palpitating peals my requiem toll ! 

But grant me first my work may finished be : 

No sap-wood, when the axe strikes through the boll ! ' 

It will be seen from this example that Mr. 
Neidig is a poet who speaks with his own voice, 
and knows how to give vigorous expression to a 
fairly imaginative conception. In this case, also, 
the thought is clear-cut, and little of the mean- 
ing is left in doubt. We cannot say as much, 
however, for most of the fellow-poems, which 
cultivate obscurity to an extent which is not 
permissible. Strained-for effects are apt to be 
effects missed, and much of Mr. Neidig's verse, 
for all its originality and unquestionably poetic 
diction, makes too hard reading to fulfil the 
proper function of poetry. Yet we would not 
seem ungrateful for an offering whose fashion is 
so far beyond the average mechanical verse of 
the day, with its endless echoes and imitations. 

Mr. Louis Vernon Ledoux's ' Songs from the 
Silent Land ' are, according to the author's 
classification, grouped as poems of life, love, 
nature, and thought. The category of love may 
be illustrated by this irregular but beautiful 
sonnet : 

' Since this is true : that thou dost love me, dear ; 

That thou wilt stoop my life to sanctify ; 

That thou wilt raise me now ere youth shall die. 
Above my twilight shadows, deep and drear. 

That I may reach the purer region high 
Where thou dost dwell, and ever still be near 
Thy side, and ever hear thy singing, clear 

And sweet as song of seraph In the sky : 

My love will teach me all that thou has known 
Of God and life, that I may catch through thee 
Prophetic glimpses of His truth and grace ; 
And watch in thee His semblance, clearly shown. 
Till in the sunlight of eternity, 

I come, at last to meet Him face to face.' 

The following nature-picture may fitly exem- 
plify another of the categories: 

' In golden and scarlet pomp of Fall, 

Sabled with cedars the valley lay ; 
With darkling storm-clouds over all. 

Save here and there where a gleaming ray 
Prom the sun, like a molten sword of fire, 

Slanting fell from the flaming sphere. 
Where the hidden light of the world's desire 

Is throned In the golden atmosphere. 
The river browned with a recent rain. 

With crested ridges of white-capped foam. 
Heedless of beauty in hill and plain. 

Eagerly swept to Its ocean home. 
The azure mountains far away 

Majestic rose neath the dark gray sky. 
Pinnacled clear on the verge of day, 

Steadfast, Immutable, calm and high ; 
Till a silent cloud of silver snow 

Passed like a veil o'er the domes of blue. 
And the sun behind in a sudden glow 

Colored its edge with a fervid hue.' 



These two examples show Mr. Ledoux to have 
refined sensibilities and something of the poetic 
vision; they are fairly representative of a body 
of work that is finished in execution and uni- 
formly pleasing. 

Mr. William Wells Newell's ' Symphonic 
Series ' of ' Words for Music ' is in part the 
republication of a collection first published ten 
years ago. It is a volume of brief lyrics of 
nature and life, and this 'Love Thought' is a 
fairly typical specimen. 

' The lake art thou, beloved, 
When the sunrise dawneth o'er ; 

My thoughts, they are water-lilies. 
That float and blow by the shore. 

' The forest art thou, beloved. 

Full leafy in warm July ; 
My thoughts, they are crimson roses. 

That twine and blossom by. 

' The heaven art thou, beloved. 

All holy at still midnight ; 
My thoughts, they are stars of summer. 

That beam with a peaceful light.' 

The most noticeable fault of the pieces is 
found in the frequent omission of articles and 
other small words necessary to the construction. 
This constitutes a rather irritating mannerism 
which the writer would do well to avoid. 

The ' Later Poems ' of the late John White 
Chadwick have been garnered into a volume by 
the writer's widow, and constitute a pleasing 
addition to our store of occasional and memorial 
verse. Mr. Chadwick was always happily inspired 
when called upon to add the grace of poetry 
to some celebration, or to pay tribute to some 
departed friend. These verses on Bryant will 
illustrate his quality: 

' He loved the vales, the woods, the streams. 
The mountains cheered his loftier mind ; 

The winds their summits nurtured found 
His soul as free and uncoHflned. 

' A deeper joy his song instilled 

For every flower that gems the sod ; 

He looked through Nature's trembling veil, 
And saw the face of Nature's God. 

' Yet more the press of busy men 

Allured him than the forest aisle. 
And more the strife with public ill 

Than ever the blue heaven's smile. 

' Wherever right her flag unfurled, 

And justice showed a better way, 
And truth and freedom spurned the night. 

And hailed the burnished spears of day, — 

' There was his place, and there he made 

His voice a clarion ringing clear 
To rouse the sleepers, wake the dead. 

And stay the faint with hope and cheer.' 

If Bryant stood ever on the side of righteous- 
ness, this his latest singer was also steadfast in 
the good old American faith, as his ' Timeo 
Danaos ' sonnet may witness. 

' Art proud, my country, that these mighty ones, 
Wearing the jeweled splendor of old days. 
Come bringing prodigality of praise 

To thee amid thy light of westering suns;

Bidding their blaring trumpets and their guns 
Salute thee, late into their crooked ways 
Now fallen ; to their sorrow and amaze. 

Blood of whose hearts the ancient honor runs? 

' Nay, fear them rather, for they cry with glee, 
"She has become as one of us, who gave 

All that she had to set a people free : 

She wears our image — she that loved the slave ! " 

Fear them, for there is blood upon their hands. 

And on their heads the curse of ruined lands.' 

We ma}- also commend to the attention of our 
modern imperialists the verses which comment, 
in caustic accents, upon President Eoosevelt's 
remark that 'there was not enough of the last 
war to go round/ 

' The Ninth Paradise ' is a title suggested by 
these verses from the Arabic : 

' In the nine heavens are eight Paradises : 
Where is the ninth one? In the human breast. 

' Rather, O man I lack those eight Paradises 
Than be without the ninth one in thy breast.' 

This thought is expanded into ' Thyself Within,' 
the first piece in a collection of poems by Mr. 
James H. West. 

' Amid the ceaseless loss and change 

Of time and friends and all below, — 

(O things we love '. how swift ye go ! 

O things that are: how new and strange!) — 

Ah, whither shall our spirits range 

A more eternal life to know ! 

' In Syria, Ind, or Egypt sought. 

One answer only have the years 

Sent down to banish doubts and fears : — 

Within thyself must Heaven be caught 

And captive held, — or all is tears ! 

For this saints died and martyrs fought. 

• Thyself within ! Thyself within ! 
O soul ! find here thy strength, thy peace. 
Pray not that loss and change may cease, — 
Pray, rather, higher heights to win : 
Thy spirit's heavenward wings release. 
And soar thee where thou art akin ! ' 

The fine spirituality of these lines is dom- 
inant throughout the volume which they thus 
fittingly preface. Mr. Wesf s poems breathe a 
gentle and exalted idealism; they question the 
shows of life that they may search out its deeper 
meanings; and they rest upon a firm basis of 
faith in the ' far-off divine event ' toward which 
mankind is slowly groping its way. They have 
the inspiration of Tennyson and of Emerson in 
their acceptance of the present as an earnest for 
the future. 

' O humankind ! from hills where darkness hides. 

From lands of old where lava-torrents hum, 

Down riverways tumultuous thou has come, — 

With yet small lodgment found where grain abide:^. 

How slow the centuries ! how blind the guides ! 

The multitude — how deaf and halt and dumb ! 

Yet steadily Love's wealth adds sum to sum. 

And age by age the flood of Wrong subsides.' 

Mr. Lloyd Mifflin, whom we know best by his 
carefully-chiselled sonnets, is also an adept in 
other lyrical measures, as may be seen in his 
latest volume. ' The Fleeing Nymph and Other 
Verse,^ although it comprises nearly fifty pieces, 
includes only three sonnets out of the entire 
number. There is much delicate art in these 



songs, and they are freighted with a rich bur- 
den of thought. We quote a pair of quatrains 
called 'Reproachful Ghosts.' 

• As glittering gall«>n8, scornful of the shore. 

Bound for the Fortunate Isles with favoring breeze, 

Sink ere they reach their goal, and ever more 
Phantom the dim mid-seas : 

' So, for the ports unknown, at lift of sun. 
We sail afar with flaunting pennon high ; 

Iiife whelms us, and the ghosts of deeds imdone 
Stalk in our evening sky.' 

Mr. Edward 0. Jackson's *Love Sonnets to 
Ermingarde ' are exactly one hundred in num- 
ber, and their recipient has reason to be proud 
of the imagery and emotion which she evokes 
in the soul of her poet. It is the Shakesperian 
model that Mr. Jackson follows, both as to form 
and to diction, as the following pretty affecta- 
tion will illustrate : 

' Creep on, proud time, adown the sightless track 

Of centuries and wallowing nations wrecked. 

Heap on deceased life oblivion's black, 

And bring all things to an annulled effect : 

Tea, Time, thou treacherous traitor of deceit. 

That seem'st to give what thou dost take away. 

Here I predict thy ignomy's defeat. 

And all thy cruel crimes In hate array: 

Thou canst not, with thy false adulterate spite. 

Take from my Love's flame one superfluous beam 

Of glory's guerdon of eternal light 

Which to posterity shall ever gleam — 

For why? — ^My lines shall flout thy foul dismay. 

And in my lines my Love shall win the day.' 

The well-known musical critic, Mr. W. J. 
Henderson, has published a volume of verse 
entitled, as becomes the author's vocation, 
' Pipes and Timbrels.' It includes sonnets, lyr- 
ics, and studies in smoothly-cadenced blank 
verse. We quote ' A December Night.' 

' The steel blue Vega slopes adown the west. 
Beyond the ghostly hills and shadowed stream, 

Downward to unfathomable rest. 

Sweeter than silence, dearer than a dream. 

' The armSd Perseus follows in her train 
Hard by Andromeda, whose cohorts glide. 

Like solemn music through a cloistered lane, 
Adown the west with the celestial bride. 

' O'erhead roll Taurus and the Pleiad band 
Along the hollows of the heavenly deep ; 

Orion follows with his flaming brand. 
That smites the curtain of the eye to sleep. 

' So moves the shining army of the night 
Across the front of space, serene, profound. 

Till Sirius floods the east with master light. 
And lo ! the king of all the stars Is crowned.' 

One section of Mr. Henderson,3 volume is de- 
voted, as might be expected, to poems upon 
musical subjects. Among them is an interest- 
ing transcript of the Seventh Symphony, 
whereof the Allegretto runs as follows : 

' Shall death avail, love. 
Death cold and pale, love? 
Shall we now quail, love 
We that are one? 
Here where we lave, love. 
In passion's wave, love ; 
Is there a grave, love. 

Out of the sun? 
Ah, do not weep, love ; 
We two shall sleep, love. 
Wrapped in that deep, love, 

When life is run.' 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



A series of fifty-five sonnets, liaving epochs, 
ideals, and personalities for their themes, con- 
stituting a sort of fragmentary CuUurgeschichte 
in verse, is the work of Mr. Gamaliel Bradford, 
Jr., and is called 'A Pageant of Life/ We 
select ' The Eenaissance ' for our illustration. 

'After the dreary night of blood and grief, 
A crimson dawn of joy and splendor flowed 
Out of the East, and touched the dark abode 

Of stupid, low-browed priest and feudal thief. 

All Europe woke and sighed with sweet relief. 

Wondered and watched, while clear and clearer glowed 
Old loveliness, which neither storms corrode 

Nor years can dim, though thick with gross belief. 

Then sudden poured the fount of beauty forth, 
Gorgeous with color, rich with phrase and rhyme. 
Packed close with human love and hate intense; 
It purpled east, and west, and south, and north. 
Splendid with varying hues in every clime, 
A carnival of passion and of sense.' 

Besides these, and other, sonnets, Mr. Brad- 
ford's volume gives us some charming lyrics, a 
deeply-sympathetic poem placed upon the lips 
of Leopardi, and two successful translations 
from that world-wearied singer. 

A daring and somewhat unregulated imag- 
ination is the chief characteristic of 'The 
Haunted Temple, and Other Poems,' by Mr, 
Edward Doyle. The titular piece is a long com- 
position in stanzas which embody a sort of alle- 
gorical vision of the place of lost souls. We may 
best exemplify Mr. Doyle's poetic quality by 
means of his sonnet on ' The Jews in Russia.' 

' From town and village to a wood, stript bare, 
As they of their possessions, see them throng. 
Above them grows a cloud : it moves along, 

As flee they from the circling wolf pack's glare. 

Is it the Brocken-Shadow of despair. 

The looming of their life of cruel wrong 

For countless ages? No; their faith is strong 

In their Jehovah ; that huge cloud is prayer. 

A flash of light, and black the despot lies. 

What thunder round the world ! 'Tis transport's strain 
Proclaiming loud : "No righteous prayer is vain. 

No God-imploring tears are lost; they rise 
Into a cloud, and in the sky remain 

Till they draw lightning from Jehovah's eyes." ' 

Mr. Doyle has the misfortune of being blind, for 
which his inward vision is perhaps all the 
clearer. 

Last on our list comes a little book, ' From 
Crypt and Choir,' by Mr. Louis Alexander Eob- 
ertson, whose earlier volumes we have read with 
much pleasure. We quote the preparatory 
poem, which gives to the volume its title. 

' From crypt and choir these rhymes are penned. 
For grief and gladness in them blend. 

There is a cell beneath Song's fane 

Where many a prisoned of pain 
Hath found the Muse his closest friend. 

Above his couch she comes to bend. 
She teaches him to make and mend 
The psalm he sues her to obtain 

From crypt and choir. 

She makes the organ's thunder rend 
His raftered roof; the tones descend 

And flood the dungeon with their strain ; 

But unto her he turns to gain 
The calmer chords she loves to lend 
From crypt and choir.' 



Mr. Robertson, besides writing excellent son- 
nets, easily manipulates the ballads and other 
intricate forms, and gives us finished verse 
which often rises to a high level of imagination.

Early years The Royal Academy of Arts in Lon- 
of the don is a peculiar institution in many 

Royal ^cadema/respects. It is, to quote the words 
of a note Avritten by one of its former presidents, 
*a private institution under the patronage and 
protection of the king, existing by his will and 
pleasure, communicating immediately with His 
Majesty, submitting all its laws and proceedings 
to his sanction, and responsible only to his Maj- 
esty for the manner in which its concerns are 
administered.' It is under the control of the 
crown, yet has to give no account of itself to 
Parliament or to any of the state departments. 
While doing a work of national importance, it 
has no subsidy from the government. If in finan- 
cial difficulties it might by precedent expect 
assistance from the sovereign (it has not received 
such aid since 1780) but could claim nothing from 
the Treasury. The president has access to the 
king to consult him on all matters affecting the 
interests of the government of the institution. 
It has been in existence less than a century and a 
half, but its career has been eminently success- 
ful. By maintaining a free school for art students 
under the direction of leading artists, it has 
played a significant part in art education, and it 
has been for many years recognized as the gov- 
erning influence in art matters in England. 
Although restricted from the beginning in its 
membership to forty Academicians and twenty 
Associates, there were upon its rolls down to 1904 
the names of a hundred and thirty-five Academi- 
cians,— painters, architects, and sculptors,— 
including the most noted names in the annals of 
British art. All these things considered, a his- 
tory of the Royal Academy should be a valuable 
contribution to the history of art in England. 
Such a history was undertaken by the late J. E. 
Hodgson, R.A., and Frederick A. Eaton, Secre- 
tary of the Academy, and received further assist- 
ance subsequent to the death of Mr. Hodgson 
from Charles Leslie, R.A. The handsome volume 
which is the result of this collaboration, 'The 
Royal Academy and its Members, 1768-1830^ 
(imported by Scribner), although rich in histor- 
ical material, illustrations', and appendices, and 
containing valuable biographical sketches, fails 
to give that view of art-development which the 
reader would naturally be led to expect. It gives 
the annals of the Academy during the adminis- 
trations of but three of its presidents, Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, Benjamin West, and Sir Thomas Law- 
rence, and closes abruptly with the death of Law- 
rence in 1830. Its biographical sketches of Aca- 
demicians and Associates during those administra- 
tions tell us more of the lives of their subjects

than of their art, and confirm the reader in the 
opinion that the later seventy years of the his- 
tory of the Royal Academy and of British Art,— 
the period of Millais, of Lord Lei^hton, of Akna- 
Tadema, and others,— is a far more glorious 
period than that of Reynolds, of Gainsborough, 
and of Turner. The chapters relating to the gen- 
esis of the Academy are not lacking in interest, 
but it is apparent that the artists of those earlier 
days did not experience the psalmist 's blessedness 
of dwelling together in unity, and their petty jeal- 
ousies and disputes were scarcely worthy of per- 
petuation in a history related to that of the de- 
velopment of a nation's art. 

FitzGeraid Somewhat out of his element, in 
<u an English a wav that is half -amusing, half- 
man of letters, pathetic, must Edward FitzGeraid 
appear to his friends when they see him clothed 
in the uniform of the 'English Men of Letters' 
series (Macmillan). Judged by English-men-of- 
letters standards, he was bound to receive some 
rather hard knocks; and Mr. A. C. Benson, his 
biographer, has not spared him. Anything like 
hearty praise is accorded only to the Omar 
quatrains and the Letters, and in that order. 
Apart from his one masterpiece of translation, 
or paraphrase, poor E. F. G. is sharply called 
to order for taking such liberties with the works 
of others,— works for the understanding of which 
Mr. Benson questions the translator's philological 
equipment. While not unappreciative of Fitz- 
Geraid 's unique quality, the author indulges in 
regrets that he had not done this or that, or 
been something other than he was. *It is to be 
wished,' he says, referring to the early love- 
affair with Caroline Crabbe, 'that this romance 
had had a normal ending.' But what likelihood 
of any Rubaiyat or Letters from a normalized 
family-man FitzGeraid? Regret is expressed, or 
implied here and there, that FitzGeraid had not 
the energy to rouse himself from his dilettante- 
ism, his gentle pessimism, his dreamy inactivity. 
The foibles were, in this case, of the very essence 
of the man. Mr. Benson is now and then self- 
contradictory. We are told that though Fitz- 
Geraid admired his friends generously, *he also 
took severe account of their faults. 
He did not think a friend a poet because he 
happened to write verses, or an artist because he 
painted pictures.' Yet we read elsewhere that he 
'started with a predisposition to admire the work 
of those he loved, not only for its intrinsic mer- 
its, but because it was a part of them'; and 'it 
is ob%-ious that FitzGeraid 's later A*iews of Car- 
lyle, and even of his writings, were much modi- 
fied by their friendship.' Again, 'the unpardon- 
able sins to FitzGeraid were uncouthness and 
slovenliness'; but later slovenliness is designated 
as one of his primary failings, and 'it was not a 
superficial sloppiness ; it penetrated the mind and 
character as well.' Of the translator's excuse 
for certain omissions in the 'CEdipus Tyrannus,' 
Mr. Benson says, 'the defence would only be 
valid if FitzGeraid had thrown the plot over- 
board and constructed a play of his own on the 
same plot,'— a puzzling combination of rejection 



and retention. A good illustration of the way 
tradition grows occurs in the description of John 
FitzGeraid, of whom we read that 'when he 
preached, or even when he listened to sermons, 
he was accustomed to remove certain articles of 
dress, such as boots and stockings ... to 
make himself quite comfortable.' This appears 
to be an amplification of Mr. Thomas Wright's 
statement that as a preliminary to his pulpit dis- 
course the eccentric preacher ' would even remove 
a boot.' This new life of FitzGeraid, of whom 
we already have two biographies, not to mention 
the autobiographic Letters, meets no crying need. 
The literary strictures, however just, seem not 
exactly called for in 'Old Fitz's' case; and all 
else is a twice-told tale. 



Chapters on Mr. Frank Preston Stearns's pleas- 
Neu) England ant collection of 'Cambridge 
celebrities. Sketches' (Lippincott) contains 
many true things that are not new and doubt- 
less do not aim at novelty, and also some new 
things that are not true however unintentional 
their falsity. For example, the author says of 
Lowell that in the law 'he succeeded as well as 
youthful attorneys commonly do,' and that dur- 
ing the ten years following his marriage to Maria 
White 'he worked hard and lived economically, 
earning what he could by the law, and what he 
could not by magazine writing.' But Scudder 
gives a very different account, which Lowell's 
published letters tend to confirm. The young 
poet seems never to have entered seriously on the 
practice of the law, and we are distinctly told 
that in those first months of his married life — 
the winter he and Maria spent in Philadelphia— 
his only earnings were from his pen, and that on 
his return to Cambridge the next summer he 
abandoned all pretense of following the law. 
Again, we read, 'The trochaic metre in which 
"Hiawatha" is written would seem to have been 
his [Longfellow's] own invention.' Surely Mr. 
Steams has not forgotten the critics' senseless 
outcry against Longfellow for appropriating 
metre as well as incidents from the 'Kalevala,' 
That the Finnish epic suggested the metre, the 
American poet made no secret. Of Longfellow 
it is further said, 'As a master of verse he has 
no English rival since Spenser' — which at least 
the Tennysonians wiU dispute. A centennial 
tribute to Bronson Alcott records among other 
things that 'to the last he would never touch 
animal food.' But Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis 
has recently told us, in her 'Bits of Gossip,' with 
what hearty relish the good man attacked a sir- 
loin of beef at Hawthorne's table, as a prelude 
to the praises of vegetarianism. The chapter on 
Dr. Holmes asserts that 'the essence of humor 
consists in a contrast which places the object or 
person compared at a disadvantage.' Is not this 
rather sarcasm, or ridicule? Humor, which 
Thackeray defines as a mixture of love and wit, 
is not primarily ill-natured. The author is not 
quite careful enough in his grammar. He writes, 
'It is doubtful if Cranch ever laid awake over 
his work.' and, speaking of one of Cranch 's land- 
scapes, 'I think it must have been painted an-

terior to his sojourn in Rome.' 'Anteriorly to' 
would have been grammatically correct; but why 
this strange contortion when * before' is all that 
is meant? 'An Italian lazzaroni' astonishes the 
reader — in the 'Leaves from a Roman Diary,' 
too. Misprints are numerous. At the bottom of 
page 329 there is a hopeless muddle involving 
several lines. While the book contains much 
agreeable reading matter and a number of good 
portraits, its chapter on George L. Stearns, the 
author's father, is its only noteworthy contribu- 
tion to biography. 



A readable 
volume on 



One of the latest additions to the 
'English Men of Letters' series 
Thomas Moore. (Macmillan) is Mr. Stephen Gwynn's 
volume on Thomas Moore. In style and lucidity 
of exposition, the book amply sustains the char- 
acter of the well-known series edited by Mr. John 
Morley. The author has succeeded well in pre- 
senting the poet's engaging personality. For this 
he has drawn freely upon Moore's own writ- 
ings and correspondence and the letters of con- 
temporaries. We are given a satisfactory view 
of the poet's domestic life, his relations with his 
publishers, in which he is always a model of 
honor, and his relations with the public men of 
his day. Among these, Lord John Russell, who 
became Prime Minister in 1847, five years before 
Moore's death, was perhaps the poet's most inti- 
mate friend and his chief biographer. Mr. 
Gwynn's book is compact with information and 
well-balanced criticism. During the poet's life- 
time his lyric verse was in great vogue. This 
was true of the 'Odes of Anacreon,' his first pub- 
lished work, as well as of the much more famous 
Irish Melodies. The poet's personal magnetism 
had much to do with the popularity of his verse. 
Moore travelled much, and was a social favorite. 
He was a charming singer of his own Irish songs. 
But the fatal fluency of his composition stamped 
the seal of transitoriness upon much that he 
wrote. Outside of the 'Irish Melodies,' he wrote 
very little lyric verse that has not already evapor- 
ated. Mr. Gwynn attributes the fading of 'Lalla 
Rookh,' Moore's most pretentious poetic effort, 
to 'work done against the grain, and relying for 
its success on the secondary qualities of elaborate 
finish, profusion of ornament, and variety of 
interest.' The development of his interest in 
themes requiring prose treatment wrought a 
depressing effect upon his muse. His prose taste 
turned in the direction of biography, and he wrote 
successful lives of Sheridan, Byron, and Lord 
Fitzgerald, the famous Irish revolutionist. He 
wrote also a four-volume history of Ireland. His 
life of Byron, says Mr. Gwynn, has 'been more 
read than any biography in the language, with 
the single exception of Boswell's.' The 'Gen- 
eral Appreciation,' forming Mr. Gwynn's last 
chapter, is a good piece of literary criticism. 
Moore's originality as a metrical artist is given as 
his chief distinction in poetry. His skill in 
rhythmical invention and stanzaic variety is 
shown in the remarkable success with which he 
reproduced Irish folk-songs in English metre. 
Interesting side-lights are thrown on Moore's 



relations with Byron, Scott, and Leigh Hunt. Mr. 
Gwynn's volume shows a well-proportioned use 
of his abundant materials, and he has given a 
sincere and readable study of a very interesting 
poetic personality. A complete bibliography of 
Moore's works is a valuable feature of the book. 



An interesting Mr. George Alexander Fischer has' 
character-study given US a new character-study of 
of Beethoven. Beethoven (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 
which is perhaps the most rational, convincing, 
shrewd, and sympathetic estimate yet made. It 
is a valuable book to the student of music, for its 
brilliancy as well as its depth of analysis, besides 
its mass of information. The author shows us 
that Beethoven is the 'philosopher of music,' that 
in his work the philosophic spirit comes to the 
fore, and that his genius as a musician is affili- 
ated with a broad mental scope, an altruistic 
spirit, which enabled him to address the intellect 
of mankind. The events and influences of his 
life, and their part in determining the character 
of his compositions, are followed throughout his 
career, so that Mr. Fischer's work becomes at 
once a biography and a musical criticism. As a 
corollary, he outlines Wagner's indebtedness to 
Beethoven: 'Beethoven, in Wagner's estimation, 
is a landmark in music, just as Shakespeare is in 
literature, as Jesus or Buddha in religion. He 
is the central figure; all others are but radii 
emanating from him. To Beethoven was it given 
to express clearly what the others could but 
dimly perceive. The relation of men like Bach 
or Handel toward Beethoven, Wagner held to be 
analogous to that of the prophets toward Jesus; 
namely, one of expectancy. The art reached its 
culmination in Beethoven. This is Wagner's 
summary of the significance of Beethoven's work, 
and he pi'oclaimed it continually from the house- 
tops. It was in some sort a religious exercise to 
him to make propaganda for the master to whom 
he felt himself so deeply indebted. The burden 
of his utterances on the subject of the musician's 
art is, "A greater than I exists. It is Beet- 
hoven." ' Wagner's achievement, according to 
Mr. Fischer, can be attributed in part to a certain 
quality of intellectual receptivity, by virtue of 
Avhich he was enabled to appropriate to himself 
the genius of the two of his predecessors for 
whom he had a special affinity, — Shakespeare and 
Beethoven, who served him as models. 

Classical A new contribution to the discus- 

revivai in sion of Classical Training comes 
Education. from the Knickerbocker Press (Put- 
nam) in the form of five collected addresses 
by Professor Sidney G. Ashmore, of Union Col- 
lege. The plea is to the general reader, with the 
aim of persuading him to devote some part of his 
time, however small, 'to upholding the interests 
of a cause that is without doubt a losing one 
just at the present time.' As this is a scientific 
age. Professor Ashmore seeks to put his argu- 
ment on a scientific basis. The results of the 
investigation of specialists in education, he main- 
tains, 'justify the inference that mental growth 
and expansion are conditioned by, and are

directly dependent on, the development of the 
brain; that each form of mental activity has its 
origin in those nerve centres of the brain which 
are expressly assigned by nature to the function 
or activity in question; that the development of 
the concept centres is greatly aided through the 
foimal study of language, and that the language 
most admirably suited to this purpose is Latin.' 
Under the freedom of the elective sj-stem so 
widely prevalent at present, we are not quite 
sure that such an argument can have much to do 
with determining the proportion of any given 
class which shall elect Latin. A demonstration 
that the Latin section of any g^ven class will 
develops a larger propoi'tion of successful quar- 
ter-backs, pitchers, etc., would be much more 
likely to show practical results in the direction 
of the author's purpose. He is certainly right in 
his opinion that the Latin is preeminently a log- 
ical language, and fitted to develope the logical 
faculty in those who study it; but we are not 
quite sure that Latin teachers generally secure 
results in this line at all commensurate with the 
possibilities. Perhaps the newly-formed Classical 
Association of the Middle West and South, with 
its avowed intention to get nearer to the work 
of the teacher than has been the ease with the 
American Philological Association, is to be the 
medium of a genuine Classical revival. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. B. H. Blackwell, Oxford, publishes 'Byways 
in the Classics,' by Mr. Hugh E. P. Piatt. This 
is a reproduction (with much additional matter) 
of Mr. Piatt's little book of a year or so ago 
entitled 'Alia.' It consists of jottings from the 
note-book of a lover of the classics, and includes a 
great many Greek and Latin parallels to modern 
proverbial and colloquial phrases, besides mottoes 
for various uses, and an interesting collection of 
classical quotations in modern political oratory. 
The book is a medley, of course, but one in which 
scholars will delight, and which they will also find 
useful as a treasure-house of apt illustrations for 
literary uses. 

'The Gray Brethren, and Other Fragments in 
Prose and Verse,' published by Messrs. E. P. 
Button & Co., is a posthumous book by the writer 
who called herself 'Michael Fairless,' and who was 
chiefly known by two books called 'The Koad- 
mender' and 'The Gathering of Brother Hilarius.' 
The present volume, like its predecessors, is marked 
by an exquisite simplicity of diction and a delicacy 
of spiritual insight that are far out of the common. 
Its contents consist of short stories, sketches, and 
bits of verse, with a group of four fairy-tales at 
the end. The story of 'The Dreadful Griffin' is one 
of the very nicest fairy tales that we have ever 
read. 

The Vassar Brothers Institute, Poughkeepsie, 
publish a reprint, in facsimile, of 'The Debates and 
Proceedings of the Convention of the State of New 
York, June 17, 1778.' This was the convention that 
met at Poughkeepsie to consider the ratification of 
the Constitution, and a complete report of the 
proceedings was taken in shorthand. Students of 
the critical period of American history will welcome 
this republication of a rare volume having great 
dpciimentary value,

been published in a neat volume by the Cambridge 
University Press (The Macmillan Co.). 

Students of literary criticism will be glad to have 
the 'Select Translations from ScaUger's Poetics' 
which Professor F. M. Padelford has just published 
is a volume of the 'Yale Studies in English.' This 
pamphlet may be had from Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co. 

Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. are the publishers of a 
new 'Cabinet' edition of Disraeli's 'Vivian Grey,' 
' Coningsby, ' ' Sybil,' and ' Tancred,' which four 
novels are now collectively entitled 'Young 
England.' They are edited, with introductions, by 
Mr. Bernard N. Langdon-Davies, and illustrated by 
Mr. Byam Shaw. 

Mr. Inazo Nitobe's 'Bushido, the Soul of Japan' 
is published in a revised edition, with an introduc- 
tion by Dr. William Elliott Griffis, by the Messrs. 
Putnam. This little book has had a remarkably good 
fortune, having run into a sixth edition in the 
Japanese reprint, besides being translated into a 
number of European and Asiatic languages. 

An important addition to the 'Trail Makers' 
series of Americana published by Messrs. A. S. 
Barnes & Co., is Mr. A. F. Bandelier's edition of 
the 'Relacion' of Cabeza de Vaca, translated by 
Miss Fanny Bandelier. The volume includes a 
certain amount of supplementary matter, besides 
a conjectural map. 

Mr. Henry Frowde has published two volumes of 
extracts from the 'Studies in History and Juris- 
prudence' of Mr. James Bryce. One of these 
volumes gives us a reprint of six chapters of that 
work under the general title of 'Constitutions' 
while the other reproduces the single chapter on 
'Marriage and Divorce.' The author has written 
special introductions for both volumes. 

'A First View of English Literature,' by 
Professors W. V. Moody and E. M. Lovett, is a 
simplified form of their 'History of English 
Literature,' with the addition of portraits, and of 
suggestions for both teacher and student. We 
commend particularly the 'Review Outline' which 
follows each chapter of the book. In point of 
style, accuracy, and soundness of judgment, this 
book is highly meritorious and deserves a hearty 
welcome.

LITERARY PERSPECTIVE. 



We have been a good deal surprised to notice 
that the reviewers of current literature, in 
newspapers and even in professedly literary 
Journals, have very generally discussed Dr. 
Brandes's ' Xaturalism in England ' as if it 
were a new book. We have seen it receive 
column after column of comment, bestowing 
praise or censure according to the whim of the I 



particular writer, but saying not a word to indi- 
cate the fact that the book is now thirty years 
old. In a few instances, this neglect is prob- 
ably due to sheer ignorance; in the others, it 
must be set down to a hazy notion that bring- 
ing an old foreign book to the attention of the 
English public somehow makes it a new one. 
Similarly, we have just had heralded as a new 
book, and will soon have reviewed as such, Mr. 
Swinburne's novelette in epistolary form, called 
*A Year's Letters,' and published serially as 
far back as 1877, as all Swinbumians know. In 
this case, there seems to have been a deliberate 
attempt to deceive the public into expecting a 
newly-written book instead of the reprint of an 
old one. 

Leaving aside the question of ethics which is 
raised by these misleading practices, there is a 
critical question involved in them of the first 
importance. The time has long gone by when 
it was thought that a piece of literature might 
be adequately discussed hy the application of 
abstract principles without making any refer- 
ence to the circumstances under which it was 
produced. Taine taught us the futility of that 
proceeding very thoroughly, even if himself 
blind to other necessary aspects of criticism. 
How ridiculous then it is to discuss the book of 
Dr. Brandes, itself only an intermediate section 
of a larger treatise, without allowing all the 
time for the fact that it was the work of an 
impetuous young man, written from the point 
of view of Continental radicalism, and at a date 
when the period of English literature with 
which it deals had not been taken up in any 
adequate kind of way by critics to the manner 
bom. Examined in the light of these facts, 
the book becomes illuminating; if they are 
ignored, it misses its proper effect. And so 
with Mr. Swinburne's satirical presentment of 
English society in the mid- Victorian period, the 
reader who does not keep constantly in mind 
the time of its writing and the age of its writer 
will find it to have little meaning. Yet we 
expect during the next few weeks to read many 
reviews of the book making no mention of these 
essential facts, and open to the implication, at 
least, of assuming that it offers a view of pres- 
ent-day society as mirrored in the mind of a 
sage of seventy or thereabouts. 

It is necessary, not only for the understand- 
ing of a book, but also for its enjoyment, to 
take into account the time, place, and mUieu 
of its production. This is the formula which 



78 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



Taine gave us, and the process may be more 
succinctly designated as viewing the book in 
perspective. It is true that some works, by 
the universality of their appeal, by their foun- 
dation upon the eternal verities of the spiritual 
life, may make a direct and powerful impres- 
sion upon the untutored mind, and seem to 
have little need of historical illumination. Un- 
schooled adults, and even children, may feel 
much of the truth and beauty of Isaiah, or of 
Homer, or of Shakespeare, for to this truth 
many autobiographies and confessions bear wit- 
ness. In such books, soul speaks to soul, 
eschewing the intermediary of the trained and 
critical intellect; the utterance, for its essential 
message, might be that of a contemporary. 
Nevertheless, it must be allowed that the seri- 
ous student, even of these universal books, gets 
a far fuller and richer comprehension of their 
contents, and a reward in proportion to the 
extent of his historical realization of their 
origin. In a word, the truer the perspective in 
which he views them, the better is he prepared 
to sound their meaning and sympathize with 
the life which they portray. 

It may be urged, per contra, that a naive joy 
in the masterpieces of world-literature is more 
genuine than one that comes from conscious 
study, and there is no doubt that the edgie of 
appreciation may be dulled by too curious an 
inquiry into particulars. This process, in gain- 
ing one perspective, runs the risk of losing an- 
other. If it be carried to the point of pedantry 
— and the danger of carrying it that far is by 
no means imaginary in these days of a Teuton- 
ized higher education — the student of litera- 
ture will lose sight of the wood for the trees, 
and the trees will prove to be a particularly 
thorny and repellant growth of linguistics, and 
archaeology, and philosophical phrase-monger- 
ing. To change our metaphor, the one who 
studies literature in this spirit will be apt to 
miss its flower, and find, when he would pluck 
it, that it has gone to seed. A better reward 
than this may be had with far less of applica- 
tion and wearisome constraint. 

But this consideration does not seriously im- 
pair our original thesis, which is that the satis- 
factions, intellectual, aesthetic, and ethical, ob- 
tainable from the great productions of literature 
are immeasurably enhanced by the cultivation 
of that historical sense which alone makes it 
possible to view these productions in their right 
relations. The thing to avoid is the micro- 
scopic habit, not the general broadening of 
vision. One cannot know too much about 
Isaiah, or Homer, or Shakespeare, but the 
knowledge must be interpreted in a large and 
liberal fashion, the fashion of Arnold, or of 
Symonds, or of Swinburne. And it must be 



knowledge of the sort that goes to the making 
of CuUurgeschichte, not of the sort that leads 
to the multiplication of monographs by German 
specialists. 

If our general position is sound as far as it 
concerns the great prophetic and poetic voices 
of humanity, whose speech, in some sense, 
transcends the bounds of time and space, how 
much more cogent must the argument be when 
applied to writers of more temporal influence 
and fame. With such writers the pressure of 
the time counts for so much that unless we 
take it somewhat fully into account their work 
is almost unintelligible, or at least so alien to 
our modern ways of thinking as to seem life- 
less. To take a few examples from English 
literature alone, how much we must read be- 
tween the lines, how much we must know of 
past political and social conditions, of intel- 
lectual outlook and literary fashion, to perceive 
the glow of vitality in such writers as Spenser 
and Donne, as Dryden and Swift, or even to 
feel the ardor with which the eager spirits of 
the later eighteenth century hailed the dawn 
of the revolutionary epoch. The springs whence 
flowed the power of these writers are sealed to 
us unless we have in some degree placed our- 
selves abreast the general stream of tendency 
to which their ideals were affluent. 

We might put the case in a very concrete 
form by asking why FitzGerald thought so 
much of Crabbe. His enthusiastic devotion to 
the Rector of Trowbridge was certainly more 
than a whim or a personal idiosyncrasy, and as 
certainly it was not due to the pride of dis- 
covery or exploitation which impels a certain 
type of critic to make, as Mr. Saintsbury puts 
it, ' a remarkably dull Italian into a god, and 
great but not rationally great Frenchman into 
a compound of Shakespeare and Plato.' The 
real answer to the question must be, of course, 
that FitzGerald, partly on account of his per- 
sonal relations with the poet's family, and partly 
on account of his intimate knowledge of 
Crabbe's life and circumstances, and of the as- 
pects of the old English life that he depicted 
with such minute truth and marvellous fidelity, 
was enabled to view his work with a sympa- 
thetic understanding utterly impossible to the 
casual reader, and thus to penetrate to the 
innermost secret of its vitality. 

This illustration of the comprehension of 
literature that comes from seeing it in its 
proper perspective may be paralleled in many 
other cases. It explains to us Charles Lamb's 
delight in Elizabethan dramatists and seven- 
teenth century worthies, William Morris's joy 
in mediaeval romance, and Austin Dobson's ap- 
preciation of the artificial writings of the eight- 
eenth century. It explains also the interest

which the most obscure and neglected of poets 
may acquire in the eyes of the modem editor 
and commentator, who makes it his business, 
not to discuss him in the dry light of abstract 
criticism, but to view him in his habit as he 
lived. It may be said that there are three main 
elements in the appreciation of literature. There 
is first the aesthetic element, which asks for 
nothing more than sheer beaut)' of expression. 
Then there is the ethical element, which re- 
quires wisdom to be concealed within the form 
of beauty, and has ever an eye to the bearing 
of literature upon conduct. Finally, there is 
the historical element, which if we bring also 
to our study, may not only enhance the other 
two, but may provide us with an additional 
pleasure of its own. And this pleasure, although 
not the deepest that literature affords, is prob- 
ably the one easiest of access and most widely 
realized, for it lies well within the reach of 
those whose senses are imperfectly attuned to 
the finer manifestations of the poetic spirit. 



COMMUXICA TIONS. 



AMERICAN AND ENGLISH COLLEGE TRAINING. 
(To the Editor of The DiAii.) 

Will you allow me a few words touching the 
I)osition of Mr. Xixon on Oxford education, as 
set forth in the leading article in your issue of 
July 16, and the comments thereon by Colonel 
Higginson in your issue of August 1. It seems 
to me that there is a fundamental difference be- 
tween the \-iew-point of our young Americans at 
Oxford, and that of Colonel Higginson; and I 
am strengthened in this belief by reading letters 
from a Rhodes beneficiary who is a fellow-towns- 
man. I think that our young men at Oxford 
are dealing less with education in the strict let- 
ter sense than with educational literary reading; 
while Colonel Higginson sees only the rigid let- 
ter. They talk of what Englishmen know of 
Dante and his times; and Colonel Higginson 
tells us how readily he can find well-equipped 
translators of French and Spanish. But these 
differing views are certainly to be expected, be- 
cause they are the views of persons of differ- 
ing periods of time. No man by taking thought 
can so add to his mental stature as to give him 
a generation-wide view in front, and an equal 
range behind; and the age qualification cuts off 
the view of the young men over the backward 
road. 

But to be more concrete. It is the belief of 
many of us that the education of the average 
American college man is scrimj)ed in general 
history; and this being the case, he lacks some- 
thing like a keel to his literary ship. I will not 
try to elaborate this, for it would take too much 
space, and probably it is unnecessary; but if I 
say that those who have little knowledge of a 



past age will, as a rule, take little interest in the 
human products of that age, I shall outline my 
meaning. 

But if this be so, whose fault is it? That of 
the American age, which wants to see the end 
straight ahead on the track, or else will not 
bother with the means. Education that does 
not lead by the shortest and best-lighted road to 
a definite object is called merely education for 
education's sake, and the young American will 
have none of it. To put in his storehouse a 
stock of mental goods that he merely may want, 
and is not sure to want, is to him a waste of 
both time and storage. And in the last analysis 
it is but too often foimd that the mental goods 
must have a market value in dollars. To this 
literally golden vision the p)oor college can op- 
pose only a protest; for everybody is stronger 
(not wiser) than anybody, and the millions be- 
heve in the vision. 

But yet this better knowledge of history is 
practical enough, if only it is carefully consid- 
ered; and the practical Englishman knows it. 
Without it, there is no straight-edge by which 
to measure great impending events. When the 
Spanish war was on, the man who knew not his- 
tory talked of tons and guns, and showed us 
that our navy was but little stronger than the 
other; but the man of historic knowledge 
quietly said that if we could so maul the Eng- 
lish in 1812, and if the English in turn had 
beaten the French, and if these again were cer- 
tain^ better sea-fighters than the Spanish, why, 
imless the advance of mechanics had been in 
Spain's favor rather than ours, we ought to 
beat. It hadn't, and we accordingly ought to 
have won ' hands down '; and we did so win. 

Let us listen, then, to the discoveries our 
Rhodes men are making with respect and rea- 
sonable credence. We are sure they are honest, 
and they are talking from things learned on the 

spot. F. H. COSTELLO.

PAUL JONES AS A HERO IN FICTION. 
(To the Editor of The Diau) 
At this period of reawakened interest in Paul 
Jones and his services for America, it may be 
fitting to recall that when Fenimore Cooper 
decided to write a romance of the sea, more than 
eighty years ago, he chose as his hero and 
mysterious 'Pilot' this adventurous 'Man without 
a Country.' The cruise of 'The Ranger' and the 
subsequent events in the life of Paul Jones, inter- 
woven with fanciful episodes, gave plot to this 
first American story of the sea. 'The Pilot,' as 
fiction, has the faults of prolixity and unevenness 
found in all of Cooper's work; but it contains two 
or three vigorous passages of shipwreck and 
storm that have not been surpassed in later tales 
of nautical adventure. In the mystery-shrouded 
Pilot of the (jrerman Ocean, guiding in safety the 
'Ariel' amid shoals and reefs, and assisting with 
shrewd daring in the clandestine mission of the 
American frigate, Cooper has made a viWd 
character, with distinguishing features of manner 



^0 



THE DIAL, 



[August 16, 



and dress which carefully conform to the histor- 
ical Paul Jones. Amid the excitement of oflBcers 
and crew, he keeps his unruffled aspect of 
authority, 'like a man who not only felt that 
everything depended upon himself, but that he 
was equal to the emergency.' The occasional 
passages of . introduction in the earlier chapters 
expand, as the story progresses, by both direct 
and subtle allusions, to a portrayal of the violent 
yet restrained passions of the man, his wild 
ambitions and fierce resentments, and his roman- 
tic and often distorted conceptions of glory. 

Cooper's Paul Jones is a strong character, with 
sufficient mystery to sustain and enhance the 
interest of the story. The intrusion of a romance 
in his life, and the love-passages, do not add to 
the vigor of the portraiture, but they do produce 
a medium through which the hero attempts to 
vindicate his tragic and seemingly treasonous 
career. As Alice Dunscombe reproaches her lover 
with disloyalty to the land of his birth, she only 
repeats the censure which his own time and later 
years have uttered against this man whose 
marvellous prowess and ambition were perverted 
from their legitimate service and rewards. In 
answer to her condemnation, Paul Jones makes 
his defense to posterity: 'My name has been 
sounded, and that in no gentle strains, when a 
whole people have quailed at it,— the craven, 
cowardly wretches flying before the man they 
had wronged. I have lived to bear the banner 
of the new Republic proudly in sight of the three 
kingdoms, when practised skill and equal arms 
have in vain struggled to pluck it down. Full 
twenty times have I met the hirelings of your 
prince in open battle, fighting ever manfully un- 
der that flag which was first raised to the breeze 
by my own hands, and which, I thank my God, I 
have never seen lowered an inch ; but with no one 
act of cowardice or private wrong in all that ser- 
vice can I reproach myself; and yet, how am I 
rewarded ? The tongue of the vile calumniator is 
keener than the sword of the warrior, and leaves 
a more indelible scar. Envy and jealousy robbed 
me of my just dues and of more than half my 
glory. They call me pirate! If I have claim to 
the name, it was furnished by the paltry outfit 
of my friends rather than by any act towards my 
enemies ! ' 

There seems almost specific forecast of this 
day of rehabilitation of his character in the hero 's 
later words: 'The truth must be finally known; 
and when that hour shall come, they will say, 
he was a faithful and gallant warrior in his day. 
. . . Think you that there are not pens as well 
as swords in America? It is a country that can 
form a world of itself; and why should they who 
inherit it look to other nations for their laws?' 
Many words of discriminating analysis have been 
spoken and writen upon this adventurer in the 
few weeks of revived interest in his grave and 
his memory. One may question, however, if a 
more just estimate of his character can be cited 
than the final tribute of Cooper, through the 
words of Griffith, when he learns of the death of 
his former pilot : ' His devotion to America pro- 



ceeded from desire of distinction, his ruling 
passion, and perhaps a little also from resentment 
of some injustice which he claimed to have 
suffered from his own countrymen; — had he lived 
in times and under circumstances when his con- 
summate knowledge of his profession, his cool, 
deliberate and even desperate courage could have 
been exercised in a regular and well-supported 
navy, and had the habits of his youth better fitted 
him to have borne meekly the honors he acquired 
in his age, he would have left behind him no 
name, in its lists, that would have descended to 
the latest posterity of his adopted countrymen 
with greater renown.'

A RADICAL, English Pakson.* 



^ ' Heaven lies about us in our infancy, and 
we lie about ourselves in our old age,' quotes 
the Eev. W. Tuckwell in opening his ' Reminis- 
cences of a Eadical Parson.' Although over- 
taken, as he declares, by ' creeping septuagin- 
tiasis,' Mt. Tuckwell shows himself to be by no 
means in his dotage — merely in his anecdotage, 
a most fertile and interesting period to his 
readers. Rector of Waltham in Lincolnshire, 
and late fellow of New College, Oxford, he 
wields the pen of a scholar, a wit, and a gentle- 
man, as well as of an energetic reformer and a 
diligent student of human nature and of social 
problems. 

Mr. Tuckwell's entrance on the field of activ- 
ity that furnishes the main theme of his book 
took place about 1883, when the contrast be- 
tween his comfortable rectory and the squalid 
pigsties that sheltered so many of his flock, be- 
came too insistent and too painful to be borne 
in silence. A course of slumming ' under the 
guidance of a much beloved Unitarian minis- 
ter,' and the reading of such books as George's 
* Progress and Poverty ' and Wallace's ' Land 
Nationalisation,' convinced him that 'the state 
of Denmark was clearly rotten,' and started the 
query, not to be silenced, whether possibly ho 
was not born to help in setting it right. Thus 
it came about that in 1884 he found himself 
addressing, by request, a neighboring Liberal 
Association in a speech that proved to be the

of stiff-necked conservatism and of vested in- 
terests, and the taunts and sneers of ignorance 
and malice, our rector became a radical parson, 
the cart-tail and the platform his week-day pul- 
pit, and the subjoined his main heads of dis- 
course, as summarized at the close of his book, 
where he points out the six tasks confronting 
English political reformers at the present time : 

* 1. AGBARiA^f Reform. Only land nationalisa- 
tion can relieve the congested towns, bring back 
the villager to the village, utilise the millions of 
unproductive acres in which aurum irrepertum 
undiscovered gold, is laid up for the spade which 
shall extract it. 2. Electoral jlSD PARLLi.iiEXTABY 
Reform. Manhood and womanhood adult suffrage; 
the single and simultaneous vote, payment of mem- 
bers, abolition of the House of Lords. 3. Labottr 
Reform. Organisation of labour bureaux; the Con- 
spiracy Act amended; employers' liability 
increased; inspectors, male and female, multiplied; 
compulsory arbitration (as a counsel of perfection 
if not an immediate enactment); a minimum wage; 
an eight-hours labour day. 4. Local GovEBXMEJfr 
Reform, The parish councils reconstituted; unpail 
magistrates swept away; London unified. 5, 
Ecclesiastical Reform. The Church of England dis- 
established and disendowed. 6. Home Rule for 
Ireland; possible now, perhaps, for the first time 
since Mr. Parnell's retirement.' 

Comment on the foregoing is not here called 
for, although some of the measures advocated, 
especially land-nationalization and a minimum 
wage, must seem to many either undesirable or 
impracticable or both. 

Experiments with his own villagers on his 
own glebe, in the face of stupid episcopal oppo 
sition, and a tour through agricultural France, 
where the land monopolist is unknown since 
the French Kevolution, demonstrated the prac- 
ticability of some sort of agrarian reform, if 
not of his own pet scheme. Here a passage 
from the book itself will set forth some of the 
things made clear by this experiment in small 
farming. The lots cultivated, it should be re- 
membered, were only two-acre, one-acre, and 
half-acre patches of what had before been prac- 
tically waste land, and were rented at one 
pound sterling per acre. 

* "When the land had been worked for two and a 
half years, it seemed time to make public the 
results. In September, 1888, we held a harvest 
home tea and prize-giving. The tenants and their 
wives sate down on the Rectory lawn, one hundred 
and twenty in number, to a substantial meal, in a 
large tent prettily decorated, and flaunting Maz- 
zini's motto, " For God and the people." Four 
prizes in money were given to the best tilled allot- 
ments in the fields at present broken up, the judge, 
manager of a neighboring farm, congratulating the 
labourers generally on the surprising excellence of 
their crops and the cleanliness of the land. 1 
pointed out to our visitors, first, that they had 
seen acres waving with splendid corn which three 
years before had been a wilderness; the profit 
going, not to the landlord or the middleman, but 
straight into the pockets of the industrious labour- 
ers who created it; and, secondly, that before their 



eyes were instances not a few, in which working 
men had in their spare time, and with their wives' 
help, cultivated as much as two acres of ground, 
saving thereon from 15 1. to 18 1. a year.' 

Elsewhere reference is made to the immensely 
increased productiveness of land thus cultivated 
as compared with its tillage by Mred labor. 

Before this, Mr. Tuckwell had been deeply 
interested in the extension of the franchise, 
and had taken an active part in ihe first gen- 
eral election (1885) under the new law. A 
curious and most unexpected bit of Jesuitic 
casuistry occurs at this point. The balloting 
was to be by the now well-known Australian 
system; but the newly-enfranchised were in 
many instances terrorized in advance and com- 
pelled to sign pledges that they would vote for 
Conservative candidates. Learning that this 
was being done in his own district, our author 
counselled the voters accordingly. ' Parlia- 
ment,' he told them in a printed leaflet, 'has 
ordained that all votes shall be secret; that no 
man shall know how any one else has voted; 
and your duty is to carry out this law and to 
keep your secret faithfully. And if you have 
signed a paper or given a promise, not under- 
standing this to be the case, I tell you that your 
signature and your promise go for nothing, and 
that your vote is, by the law of Parliament, 
still your own, to use as you think best. The 
Bible says, "Answer a fool according to his 
folly"; and so when any fool who can injure 
you if you refuse him asks you to sign a paper, 
I say, " Sign it " ; to give a promise, I say, 
" Give it." But remember, that signature and 
promise both go absolutely for nothing, as be- 
ing unfairly and illegally obtained, and that 
your vote remains your own.' The little tract 
containing this advice to voters was widely cir- 
culated, copied approvingly or disapprovingly 
by many papers, translated into Welsh, versified 
and set to the tune of ' LiUibullero,' and even 
published in American and Australian news- 
papers, thus being printed to the extent of sev- 
eral hundred thousand copies. ' Looking back 
calmly,' writes the author, 'after the lapse of 
nearly twenty years on the long-forgotten con- 
troversy as regards its moral justification, I 
profess' myself unconvinced that I was wrong, 
in the exceptional circumstances which evoked 
it. That a majority at the time condemned me 
was due to the unreasoning dislike of casuistry- 
which afSicts popular intelligence, and its con- 
fused ideas as to the nature and fundamental 
basis of morality. Non enim quidquid morale 
est honos mores facit.' But perhaps the com- 
mon instinct against telling an untruth or 
breaking a promise is not so ver}* far wrong, 
after all. The little ante-election tract that 
thus fared so far abroad is given in an appen-

dix, together with an unpublished defense of it 
that was sent to the ' Times ' in reply to an 
editorial attack. 

The popular favor accorded to Mr. Tuck- 
well's oratorical efforts appears to have been 
warm from first to last. So well did he know 
how to touch the hearts and stir the enthusiasm 
of his humbler hearers that at Manchester a 
fervid admirer rose to declare, in Hibernian 
accents, that if the parson was not an Irish- 
man he must have been bom out of his native 
country. How the good rector's parish duties 
were discharged amid all this travelling and 
speaking, and this personal investigation of so- 
cial evils, we are given no hint. Evidently he 
regarded the collective English poor as his 
parishioners ; for he says : ' The misery which 
I encountered haunted me with a sense of guilt ; 
I was ill at ease and self-reproachful unless 
when labouring to remove it. I came to under- 
stand the Pauline restlessness : " Woe is me if 
I preach not the gospel" — the gospel of dis- 
content and reform — to these poor spirits in 
prison.' The wretched condition of a poor lad 
in England, as contrasted with the cheery lot 
and hopeful outlook of a young French peasant, 
is well depicted in the following: 

* The English lad spends all his earnings; there is 
no inducement for him to save. If he puts by 
40 1., he can only invest it in the savings bank, 
and gain from it 1 1. a year. There is no excite- 
ment in 1 1. a year. It does not stimulate to the 
rigid self-denial and economy involved in saving 
40 1. out of 12 s. a week. He marries early. Why 
should he wait? He will be quite as miserable ten 
years hence as he is to-day. So at one or two and 
twenty he takes to himself a shiftless, untrained, 
penniless oloven; and at thirty, when tiie French 
peasant gains his Eachel after more vhan seven 
years of service, the Englishman's unkempt home 
is crowded with unfortunate children, to be dragged 
up, not brought up, on the unincreasing maximum 
of 12 s. a week. Naturally the youth of spirit, 
beginning life, and surveying these conditions all 
around him, leaves the country for the town. But 
grant him an acre of land, his own, as the park 
and mansion are the squire's own, so long as he 
pays the rent; he will at once begin to create upon 
it, as my allotment holders found that they could 
create 10 1. to 11 1. a year; will increase his take, 
build a cottage on it through a building society, 
marry by-and-by a sensible thrifty girl, who under- 
stands marketing, needlework, cooking, washing; 
who brings her savings to add to his, and by her 
management of bees, poultry, fruit, adds ten or 
eleven shillings a week to the income. He will 
extend his acreage till he becomes a farmer and 
abandons wage-work, or he will live in a home that 
is comfortable and his own, with money accumu- 
lating in the bank as a provision for old age and 
sickness. He will stand up alongside of the French- 
man upon equal terms, instead of blasting like a 
mildewed ear the presentment of his wholesome 
brother. ' 

A prophecy with which the book draws to a 
close tells us that ' there will be two parties in 
the future: the Tory, who in personal interest 



and defence of class, struggles to retain pre- 
rogative and supremacy; the Eadical, who in 
the interest of the community, and from Chris- 
tian motive, seeks to annihilate privilege, to end 
oppression, to confer upon suffering millions 
an equal chance of elevation and redemption. 
Between these two the Liberal has no place; 
the name can survive only as a shelter to the 
lukewarm and half-hearted; in the day of 
battle its wearers will be repudiated, alike by 
Eadicals and Tories, as ^sop's beasts and birds 
united to thrust out the bats.' He adds to this 
interesting and not unhopeful vaticination, that 
the idealist turned cynic is a mournful spec- 
tacle, and that for his part he means to die as 
he has lived, an optimist. 

The combination of scholarly polish, graceful 
wit, and hard common sense in the author of 
this veracious and on the whole convincing 
narrative, is very pleasing. This Oxford don of 
the Toynbee type (except that Toynbee was 
vehemently opposed to land-nationalization) 
appeals most winningly to the reader from the 
opening of the book to its close. Especially 
pleasing and encouraging to those of middle 
age and beyond is the success with which Mr. 
Tuckwell took up, comparatively late in life, 
what might seem to have been an uncongenial 
task. This openness to new impressions and 
hopefulness of new achievement cannot be too 
heartily commended. What is called the for- 
mation of character is too often simply the 
ignominous surrender to temperamental inertia, 
or the hopeless confinement of one's interests 
and activities to one or two narrow channels. 
Herbert Spencer's intellectual and scientific 
preoccupations early rendered him about as 
little susceptible to a large class of emotional 
and ajsthetic appeals, including the romantic 
passion, as a scalene triangle. Darwin delib- 
erately and, one almost adds, sinfully starved 
to death his love of poetry and of belles-lettres 
in general. And so we applaud our Radical 
Parson for his many-sidedness, progressiveness, 
and wide-awake open-mindedness. His volim- 
tary labors in behalf of suffering humanity 
brought him into contact with many public 
men of note, and his recollections of some of 
these form a very agreeable feature of his book. 
The only thing one might perhaps regret in the 
whole volume is that he has adorned it with a 
frontispiece portrait of himself. Not that we 
are sorry to make acquaintance with his honest, 
alert, shrewd, inquiring face; but somehow, in 
the case of a living author, we are content to 
read his likeness in the printed page. How- 
ever, the publisher may be responsible in this 
instance, and one of the author's stories cer- 
tainly demands the portrait to give it point.

The BEGixxrxGS of Our Xatioxal. 
History.* 



If a soft answer turneth away wrath, surely 
a pleasant introduction predisposes one to en- 
joy a book. To invite the reader to the first 
volume of his ' History of the United States/ 
Professor Channing could hardly have found a 
more delightful bit of our mother-English than 
these quaint sentences which he draws from 
Foulkes Robartes: 

' Who faulteth not, liveth not; who mendeth 
faults is commended: The Printer hath faulted a 
little; it may be the author oversighted more. 
Thy pain (Reader) is the least; then err not thou 
most by misconstruing or sharp censuring; lest 
thou be more uncharitable, than either of them 
hath been heedless: God amend and guide us all.' 

It is a pleasure to say that the kindly feeling 
which this foreword at once excites is in gen- 
eral not dispelled when one reads the entire 
work carefully and critically. 

A new history of the United States is in 
these days hardly a novelty ; for we have ' defini- 
tive, authoritative, and inclusive narrative ' his- 
tories, histories * from original documents by 
associated scholars,' what we may call histories 
de luxe, — and others, nearly all constructed 
and published on the soundest business prin- 
ciples. This work of Professor Channing's, 
which is to be complete in eight volumes, has 
the distinction of being almost the only en- 
deavor, since Bancroft's time, by a scholar of 
first rank, to tell, in one work and for the 
serious student, the whole story of American 
history. The first volume now appears in dig- 
nified form, without illustrations other than 
useful maps, — altogether simplex mundiiiis. 

Into the opening chapter, which contains Just 
twenty-five pages, is c-ompressed all that Pro- 
fessor Channing has to say of the Xorse dis- 
coveries, the state of Europe in the fifteenth 
century, and the voyages of Columbus ; and the 
three chapters which follow comprise the nar- 
rative of Spanish, French and English explora- 
tion and settlement down to the age of the 
English Seamen. Xo separate treatment is 
given to the American Indians or to American 
Archaeology-; and as a result of this judicious 
condensation and exclusion, the remaining four- 
fifths of the volume treat of the English colonies 
from the beginning to 1660. This emphasis 
of English origins is maintained throughout 
the work, and appears in many ways. Professor 
Channing makes the reader see how the colonies 
form part of the expansion of England. 
English institutions which throw light on those 
in America are described in a manner that al-

ning. Volume I., The Planting of a Nation in the New 
World, 1000-1660. New York: The Macmillan Co. 



ways holds our interest. In concluding this 
volume, he says: 

* Human nature was much the same in Virginia 
and Massachusetts, in Maryland and Bhode Island, 

that it was in contemporary England 

The colonists were still Englishmen in their feel- 
ings and prejudices, in their virtues and in their 
vices. . . . The year 1660 marks an epoch in 
the history of the English race, because the 
Restoration denoted the breaking down of the 
desire for reform in England and the intensifying 
of those forces which the Puritans had striven to 
overthrow. In colonial history it ended the first 
period in our annals. It saw a nation definitely 
planted in the New World (pp. 536-7). 

As such an eminently sane viewpoint would 
lead one to expect, the general tone of this 
volume evidences the author's purpose to avoid 
bias as far as possible. He himself says that 
the time and place of one's birth and breeding 
affect the judgment; and he will understand, 
perhaps, that those bom outside of New Eng- 
land cannot refrain from a genial amusement 
at the contrast between his matter-of-fact de- 
scription of the Separatist colonization of 
Plymouth, and the somewhat apologetic fervor 
which is put into a note at the end of the chap- 
ter. * It is to be hoped,' he says, * that 
Plymouth Rock may long continue to form the 
theme of annual after-dinner discourses, and 
of more formidable set orations,' — although 
'from the historian's workshop . . . the out- 
look is somewhat different. He sees that there 
never was a "landing" on Plymouth Rock or 
elsewhere, as described in oration or shown in 
painting or engraving (p. 320).' Well and 
good: but why refuse to apply the same rule 
to Virginia? and why out-Herod Alexander 
Brown, — who at least found a Captain John 
Smith to vituperate, — by omitting all refer- 
ence to Smith's work in Virginia, except a 
statement of his arrest and a note as to the 
Smith controversy? Surely there may be a 
fairer compromise between the extremists on 
both sides, in an attitude toward Smith like 
that of Osgood in his ' American Colonies.' 

It seems to us that Professor Channing, in 
his lucid and interesting account of the policy 
of Massachusetts toward those who dissented 
from the views of the governing minority, has 
explained so much that he might have added 
one point more. In the clearest terms he rec- 
ognizes the illegality, from the English stand- 
point, of many of the acts of the Massachusetts 
authorities. He tells us, again, that the Puri- 
tans had * not the remotest thought of founding 
in Xew England an asylum for the religiously 
persecuted of the earth. What they came here 
to do was to secure the freedom of their own 
consciences (p. 329).' Again, they 'were seven- 
teenth-century English men and women, pos- 
sessing the same prejudices and the same fail-

ings as their brothers and sisters whom they 
left behind in the old land ' (p. 357). Now, is 
it not clear that if animosity has been felt 
against the Puritans it is not because their 
actions were inconsistent with principles such 
as these which Professor Channing declares, 
but because they claimed to be something en- 
tirely different from their contemporaries? 
* God sifted a whole nation,' said Stoughton ; 
and New England historians have said the 
same thing ever since. Their early writings, 
as Doyle has well said, constitute not a histor}' 
but a hagiology. 

Returning to the general criticism of the 
work, let us make it clear that Professor Chan- 
ning is entirely impartial in his attitude of 
critical questioning. As he rejects the testi- 
mony of Captain John Smith, so he omits from 
his text all mention of DeGorgues' revenge upon 
Menendez and the Spaniards. Professor 
Bourne, in his ' Spain in America,' p. 188, 
gives the story and the critical difficulties which 
it involves ; but seems unwilling to reject it en- 
tirely. Without doubt, these omissions are de- 
termined partly by considerations of saving 
space : and this desire to compress may account 
for some exceptions to Professor Channing's 
usual clearness. On p. 162 it is, for example, 
stated categorically that — 

* The Virginia Charter provided a cumbrous form 
of government in which there was no one-man 
power, but everything was confided to councils. 
These were five in number. First and over all, 
there was to be in England a Council for Virginia 
composed of leading men who might or might not 
have pecuniary interest in the affairs of the com- 
pany. Then, each " colony," or " company," 
should have its council in England and each planta- 
tion should have its council in America.' 

After reading the text of the Charter, and con- 
sulting the authorities at our disposal, we are 
unable to find in the charter provision for other 
than three councils, the great council in Eng- 
land and the local ones on the plantations. The 
author's note gives no explanation of this some- 
what unique enumeration, but refers to the 
royal Instructions of the same year; and here 
the citation from Alexander Brown is loosely 
given. 

Again, we are puzzled to read on page 300, 
with reference to the Charter of Sir Ferdinando 
Gorges and his associates, obtained in 1620, 
' the governing body of this corporation was 
known as the Council for New England.' What 
is meant by ' governing body ' we do not know, 
but the charter states: 

'We . . . ordain . . . that from henceforth, 
there shall be ... in our Towne of Plymouth, in 
the County of Devon, one Body politicque and cor- 
porate, which shall have perpetuall Succession, which 
shall consist of the Number of fourtie persons, and 
no more, which shall be, and shall be called and 



knowne by the Name the Councill established at 

Plymouth in the County of Devon for the planting, 

ruling, ordering and governing of New-England in 

America.' 

That is, the corporation was the council, and 

vice versa. 

Readers of recent historical literature will 
doubtless compare this volume of Professor 
Channing's with two others which cover more 
or less the same period. Professor Osgood's 
'American Colonies in the Seventeenth Cen- 
tury' is far more detailed on the institutional 
side, and upon some points gives what seems 
to the reviewer a better interpretation of the 
documents. On the other hand. President 
Tyler's ' The English in America ' is richer in 
detail of narrative, but is by comparison much 
less accurate in parts, — in the treatment, for 
example, of the Dutch colonies. 

We might refer to other cases of unfortunate 
compression, such as the very scant discussion 
of Maine; but the space of this review is lim- 
ited, and we should be sorry for further criti- 
cism of an adverse character to overshadow our 
appreciation of the high merits of the volume. 
Professor Channing's skilful interweaving of 
English and Colonial history, his excellent sum- 
ming up of periods of time, the attention which 
he pays the questions of education, health, and 
social order, his judicial attitude in contro- 
verted questions such as that of the founding 
of Maryland, the informing bibliographical 
matter appended to each chapter, and the large 
concept of development in the Colonial period 
as a whole, — these are but a few points of 
excellence in the work. If in the volumes which 
follow the author shall be able to keep his bal- 
ance as well as in general he does in this vol- 
ume, we have no hesitation in predicting for 
the work in its entirety the very high regard of 
historical students.

The Natural. Histoky of Fishes.* 



The study of fishes marked the beginning of 
the career of Louis Agassiz, the first great 
naturalist to whom America can lay claim. 
Although no treatise on ichthyology comparable 
to his ' Poissons Fossiles,' published in Switz- 
erland, was produced by Agassiz in the land 
of his adoption, he nevertheless left a legacy 
of even greater consequence in a group of enthu- 
siastic students inspired by his teaching to con- 
tinue the study of the fishes of our rivers, 
lakes, and seas. Foremost among these fol-

lowers in the extent of his work and breadth 
of his iehthyological interests is David Starr 
Jordan, President of Leland Stanford Univer- 
sity. Dr. Jordan's published contributions to 
this science already .well-nigh reach the five 
hundred mark. The files of the serials issued 
by the United States National Museum, by the 
Bureau of Fisheries, and of numerous scientific 
and popular journals, attest his continuous 
activity for many years, and bear witness to his 
leadership in an ever-widening coterie of col- 
leagues and pupils who have shared with him 
the arduous task of iehthyological exploration 
in this continent and its adjacent seas. It was 
inevitable, as well as most fitting, that the 
* Guide to the Study of Fishes,' the most com- 
prehensive treatise on American ichthyology, 
should come from his pen. WTiat his ' Fishes 
of Xorth and Middle America,' written in 
cooperation with Dr. Evermann, is to the sys- 
tematist in ichthyology, and the * Food and 
Game Fishes ' by the same authors is to the 
sportsman and the commercial fisherman, this 
new work will be to the naturalist and general 
reader who wishes an authoritative and com- 
prehensive discussion of this great section of 
the animal world, and an impartial review of 
the salient biological facts and theories of 
iehthyological science. 

Although the work is limited in its subject- 
matter to the finny tribes, it should not be 
inferred that it is restricted in interest to 
purely iehthyological problems. Xo naturalist 
is more alert than Dr. Jordan in recognizing 
the broader import of the biological phenomena 
of his specialty. Consequently we find iehthyo- 
logical data repeatedly brought to bear upon 
the broader problems of evolution, taxonomy, 
morphology, orcology, and even Sociology. 

Dr. Jordan's book is encyclopaedic in its 
scope. ' This work treats of the fish from all 
the varied points of view of the different 
branches of the study of Ichthyology. In gen- 
eral, all traits of the fish are discussed, those 
which the fish shares with other animals most 
briefly, those which relate to the evolution of 
the group and the divergence of its various 
classes and orders most fully. The extinct 
forms are restored to their place in the series 
and discussed along with those still extant.' 
The headings of the chapters are indicative of 
the wide range of topics included. The open- 
ing one deals with the life of the fish, based on 
the familiar example of the long-eared sunfish, 
denizen of many a fishing-hole. Succeeding 
chapters treat of its exterior, dissection, skele- 
ton and the various systems of organs, its 
embryology and growth, ihstincts, habits, 
adaptations, colors, geographical distribution, 
barriers, dispersion, diseases, evolution, classi- 



fication and collection. Fishes as food for man 
is the heading of a discriminating discussion of 
the relative merits of various claimants for first 
place among food fishes, and the palm is 
awarded to the little eula^hon, or candlefish of 
our northwestern coast. In speaking of the 
methods of taking food-fishes, the author says: 
' When fish are caught for pleasure or for the 
joy of being in the woods, recreation rises to the 
dignity of angling. The man who fishes, not for 
the good company of the woods and brooks, but to 
get as many fish as possible to eat or sell, is not 
an angler but a pot-fisher. The man who kills all 
the trout he can, to boast of his skill or fortune, 
is technically known as a trout-hog. Ethically, it 
is better to Ue about your great catches of fine 
fish than to make them. For most anglers, also, it 
is more easy.* 

The facts of ichthyology are everj-where used 
to illustrate and illumine the method and the 
path of organic evolution. The closing para- 
graph of Dr. Jordan's interesting discussion of 
the distribution of fresh-water fishes is charac- 
teristic of this tendency, as well as illustrative 
of his terse, direct, and trenchant style. 

* The ultimate result of centuries on centuries 
of the restlessness of individuals is seen in the facts 
of geographical distribution. Only in the most 
general way can the history of any species be 
traced; but could we know it all, it would be as 
long and eventful a story as the history of the 
colonization and settlement of North America by 
immigrants from Europe. But by the fishes each 
river in America has been a hundred times discov- 
ered, its colonization a hundred times attempted. 
In these efforts there is no cooperation. Every 
individual is for himself, every struggle a struggle 
of life and death; for each fish is a cannibal, and 
to each species each member of every other species 
is an alien and a savage.' 

Xot content with the fishes that he has 
known. Dr. Jordan falls into the ways of some 
would-be naturalists and in a chapter on the 
mythology of fishes tells his readers of the mer- 
maid supplied by the curio trade of the Orient, 
of Rondelet's monk-fish, and even of the sea- 
serpent, of which ' many may be seen, but none 
will ever be caught. The great swimming 
reptiles of the sea vanished at the end of 
Mesozoic time, and as living creatures will 
never be known of man.' 

One of the most valuable chapters in the 
book is that which traces the growth of the 
science of ichthyology and passes critical judg- 
ment on the work of ichthyologists from Aris- 
totle and Bloch to Wright and Zittel. Portraits 
of the men whose contributions have enriched 
the science adorn the pages of this chapter. On 
page 424, Professor Bashford Dean makes the 
following estimate of Agassiz's work on fossil

tions of fundamental value. The classification of 
fishes advocated by Agassiz, based upon the nature 
of the scales, has been shown to be convenient 
rather than morphological. This, indeed, Agassiz 
appears to realize in a letter written to Humboldt; 
but on the other hand he regards his creation of the 
now discarded order of Ganoids, which was based 
upon integumental characters, as his most important 
contribution to the general study of ichthyology. 
And though there passed through his hands a series 
of forms more complete than has perhaps been seen 
by any later ichthyologist, a series which demon- 
strates the steps in the evolution of the various 
families and even orders of fishes, he is nowhere 
l6d to such important philosophical conclusions as 
was, for example, his contemporary, Johannes 
MuUer. And even to his last day, in spite of the 
light which palaeontology must have given him, he 
denied strenuously the truth of the doctrine of 
evolution, a result the more remarkable since he 
has even given in graphic form the geological 
occurrence of the various groups of fishes in a 
way which suggests closely a modern phylogenetie 
table, and since at various times he has emphasized 
the dictum that the history of the individual is 
but the epitomized history of the race.' 

We are perhaps still too near the battle- 
ground of Darwinism to hold the perspective 
necessary for an impartial estimate of the com- 
batants, especially of the antagonists of the 
successful doctrine. Natural selection still 
looms large in the landscape, overshadowing all 
interpretations of biological phenomena. But 
a cloud the size of a man's hand has arisen on 
the horizon. The rediscovery of Mendel's laws 
of hybridization, and the epoch-making Theory 
of Mutations of De Vries, bid faii^ it seems, 
to challenge the weight of authority which has 
so long directed biological progress in one direc- 
tion, and perhaps even threaten to dethrone 
Darwinism from its preeminence and to rele- 
gate it to a subordinate place. The discussion 
of the ' Theory of Mutations ' may compel a 
reexamination and revaluation of the zoological 
evidence upon which Agassiz based his rejec- 
tion of the crude evolutionary hypotheses of 
Lamarck, current at the time of his earlier 
work on fossil fishes, and his persistent refusal 
in his later years to accept as overwhelming 
the proofs offered in behalf of natural selection. 
It may be noted, in passing, that Dr. Jordan 
retains in this present work the order of 
Ganoids. 

The latter part of the first and the whole of 
the second volume is given up to a systematic 
treatment of the orders and families of fishes. 
Special attention is given to those which mark 
the probable line of descent of vertebrates 
through the phyllum of fishes. Indeed, Dr. 
Jordan goes back to the remotest ancestors to 
which the finny tribe can lay a valid claim, and 
devotes several chapters to the acorn-tongue 
worms and sea-squirts, the living and probably 
degenerate representatives of the primitive pos- 
sessors of a backbone and gill-slits. 



To this long catalogue of fishes Dr. Jordan 
brings the great and inexhaustible store of his 
information gathered in decades of research and 
an intimate knowledge both of the fishes and 
whatever has been written about them. No 
pertinent saying, no bright bit of description 
or cogent presentation of disputed ground, has 
escaped his scissors. But the best of the work 
is the author's own simple, direct, homely but 
well-balanced and comprehensive story of the 
fishes, making a book which is indeed, what the 
author hoped to make it, ' valuable to technical 
students, interesting to anglers and nature- 
lovers, and instructive to all who open its 
pages.' 

The nine hundred illustrations, many of 
them original, add greatly to the interest of the 
reader, though some that are duplicated and 
others not pertinent to the contiguous pages 
might be omitted without serious loss. Indeed, 
the necessary cost of two such bulky volumes 
will greatly limit the usefulness of this valuable 
work. It is to be hoped that an abridged 
edition in a single volume will be prepared at 
a price which will permit its wider circulation 
and insure its admission to the libraries of 
many villages and high-schools, and perhaps 
even of some college professors who will other- 
wise be deprived of its information. It is also 
to be regretted, for bibliographical reasons, that 
Dr. Jordan has chosen a title already used in 
an eminent English treatise.

A Fotjrteenth-Cextury Statesman.* 

The fourteenth century is one of the great 
centuri-es of history : it was the age of Petrarch 
and early humanism, of ' The Divine Comedy ' 
and 'The Canterbury Tales.' But while the 
revival of culture is the most prominent fact 
of this period, it is not the only important fact. 
There were activities outside the pale of art 
and letters that proved of immense importance 
to future historical writing. 

A work that deals almost exclusively with 
the political and military phases of the period 
needs, then, no apology. Mr. Armitage-Smith 
has chosen to write a biography of one of the 
more prominent men of that period, ' old John 
of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster.' But his 
work is more than the story of a life; it tells 
the history of half a century of trouble and 
warfare, of schism in church and riot in state, 
of much intellectual and social unrest. 

It may seem strange that the Duke of Lan- 
caster should be chosen as the subject of such

a study. He is not a well-known figure like 
his father Edward III. or his brother the 
Black Prince. He was not great in any respect 
except perhaps in his ambitions; but greatness 
is not always necessary to importance. And his 
activities touch more movements, more peoples, 
more vital interests, than those of any other 
statesman of that age. He was the richest and 
most powerful vassal in England. The leader 
of English armies, the chief of English diplo- 
mats, he was the son of a king, the father of a 
king, the father-in-law of two kings, and 
claimant to the crowns of Castile and Leon; he 
was personally known to all the rulers of West- 
ern Europe, and, what is also important, he 
was the friend of Chaucer and the protector of 
Wycliffe. It seems clear that he ought to be 
better known to us than he is. 

It is therefore a laudable task that the author 
has undertaken ; it is also a large task, one that 
requires much industry and learning. The 
author's sources number more than a hundred 
titles, and are gathered from all the nations of 
the western border of Europe from Scotland to 
Portugal. The results presented make a volume 
of about five hundred pages, a scholarly but 
also a highly interesting work. The author's 
English, though lacking in finish and often 
careless, is lucid and vigorous, and a dash of 
humor here and there does much to make the 
reading easy. Unfortunately, however, Mr. 
Armitage- Smith presupposes too much learning 
on the part of his readers: very frequently he 
inserts quotations from other languages, par- 
ticularly from the French, into his text. These 
should have been translated, as fourteenth- 
century French is not exactly like the Parisian 
idiom that we learn in schools to-day. We may 
be able to guess the meaning at times; still, 
the interpretation too often remains in doubt. 

After the usual introductory chapters on the 
family, childhood, inheritance, and military 
training of Prince John, the author proceeds to 
discuss Spanish' affairs. This leads up to the 
invasion of Spain by the Black Prince for the 
purpose of replacing the fugitive king, Pedro 
the Cruel, on his Castilian throne. Don Pedro 
was soon after assassinated by his rival 
Enrique, and his royal rights passed to his 
daughter Constance, who was then with the 
English at Bordeaux. Two years later, in 1371, 
she married John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lan- 
caster. The importance of this marriage and 
of the ambitious policies that grew out of it 
has received its first adequate treatment in this 
book. It has been thought that this marriage 
brought about the French-Spanish alliance of 
that time, but the author shows that it was 
already in existence three years before. How- 
ever, it did lead to an understanding between 



England and Portugal, and to an invasion of 
France in 1373 which the author believes was 
to be merely a prelude to another invasion of 
Spain. After the failure of this expedition, 
John of Gaunt favored peace with the French, — 
not, as some have supposed, because he saw the 
folly of continuing the war, but because he 
wished to isolate Castile. 

In the years immediately following, no prog- 
ress was made toward the attainment of Span- 
ish kingship. This period is largely filled with 
difficulties at home. The author holds that 
before the meeting of the 'Good Parliament* 
in 1376 there is no trace of that * Lancastrian 
influence' that the Commons are said to have 
rebelled against. John of Gaunt might have 
remained outside the quarrel that rose between 
the Parliament and the royal administration; 
he became a party to it out of loyalty to his 
father's government. In his eyes, ' criticism of 
the administration was criticism of the crown, 
and the King's son was the representative of 
the crown and the natural champion of the 
court party.' Another error that the author 
refutes is the assertion, so often made, that the 
Black Prince took the opposite course on that 
occasion and assumed the leadership of the 
Commons. 

During the same years, John of G^unt 
appears as the protector of Wycliffe; but his 
interest in the reformer grew out of wholly 
selfish considerations. The Duke was a devout 
son of the Church and a firm believer in all her 
doctrines. He was a liberal patron of abbeys 
and friaries. All the outward practices that 
religion enjoined, he performed with punctili- 
ous care. In the popular demand for reform in 
Church administration, he took no interest. 
But he hated ' political bishops,' especially such 
as placed themselves in opposition to the crown. 
Wycliffe had some ' decided views about priests 
who neglected the cure of souls for the care of 
castles,' and the Duke thought he could use 
him in his fight with the spiritual lords. Sum- 
moned by the Duke, Wychffe came to London 
to preach clerical reform. Later, when his 
enemies clamored for the heretic's life, John of 
Gaimt protected him, not because he sympa- 
thized with the Lollard movement, but because 
as a man of honor he could not desert a man 
who had served him and sought his protection. 

Mr. Armitage- Smith is also able to throw 
some light on another peculiar episode from 
the same period, the second invasion of Castile. 
For sixteen years the Duke of Lancaster had 
claimed the crowns of Christian Spain. His 
policies at home and abroad had been shaped 
by his ambition to realize this claim. In 1386 
the favorable moment seemed to have come. 
The answer to the puzzling question, how King 



88

and Parliament could be induced to assist in 
such a hopeless undertaking, the author finds 
in the confused state of European politics. 
Furthermore, the situation in England was 
fast becoming unendurable; the Duke's enemies 
would gladly do almost anything to get him 
out of the country. Though the expedition 
was a failure, the Duke found his claim to be 
of considerable value after all: it secured the 
throne of Portugal for one of his daughters, 
the throne of Castile for the other, and a hand- 
some annuity for himself. 

The author devotes about fifty pages to illus- 
trative documents, such as Lancaster's will and 
epitaph, his retinue, arms, seals, and the like. 
The book is carefully indexed and is provided 
with several useful maps. It also contains a 
few pictures, for the most part reproductions 
from fifteenth-century manuscripts. These 
have a value and interest of their own; but in 
the present work they serve mainly to empha- 
size the author's statement that ' the attempt to 
illustrate fourteenth-century history from con- 
temporary sources is almost hopeless.'

The Necessity of Empire.* 

Ten years ago, the literature of modern inter- 
national politics was so limited in amount that 
one could make himself pretty well acquainted 
with it as a mere diversion; to-day it is so for- 
midable that bibliographers are appalled by it 
and readers fairly swamped. The decade has 
been thus prolific because it has been filled with 
a succession of events and movements which 
have given every possible stimulus to people's 
interests in the affairs of the world at large. 
The Spanish-American war, the Boer war, the 
Boxer uprising, and the Russo-Japanese war, — 
not to mention a host of minor movements, — 
have all operated immensely to broaden the 
range of information and opinion of the aver- 
age European or American, or even Asiatic. 
The magazines have done their utmost to sat- 
isfy, and at the same time further to stimulate, 
our craving for knowledge of the nations across 
seas; and from travellers, newspaper corre- 
spondents, missionaries and statesmen has come 
a veritable deluge of books in which to study 
the manners, beliefs, institutions, domestic con- 
ditions and international relations of every 
people on the globe. 

In the midst of a vast amount of purely 
ephemeral literature of this sort, it is a pleas- 
ure to encounter a work which depends for its 
reception, not upon the momentary interests of 

*The Friends of England. By the Hon. George Peel. 
New York : E. P. Dutton & Co. 



the casual reader, but rather on the abiding 
zeal of the scholarly; and this, we think, may 
fairly be said of the volume before us for 
review. About three years ago the* Honorable 
George Peel published a book under the title of 
' The Enemies of England,' in which he sought 
to account for and to describe the international 
bearings of the generally admitted hostility of 
European powers toward the English. The 
grounds for this hostility he found, not in race 
or religion or manners or trade or envy, but 
rather in the persistency with which, as he 
claimed, England for the past eight hundred 
years has played the thankless role of ' cham- 
pion of the liberties of Europe.' His idea was 
that from the time of Pope Innocent III. on, a 
series of powers, — chiefly the Papacy, Spain, 
Holland, and France, — had aspired to secure 
dominion over the continent; but that, since 
the success of any one of them would involve 
the ruin of England, she had resisted and in 
the end defeated the favorite project of each 
in turn, thereby bringing down upon herself 
the hatred of them all. England was thus rep- 
resented as being in modern times the sole 
guardian of the liberties of European states and 
peoples against the cherished aspirations of 
various powers to universal dominion, even 
though her course was dictated admittedly by 
motives of self-preservation. 

Mr. Peel's new volume, ' The Friends of 
England,' is designed to supplement the earlier 
one by describing in a similar way the policy 
of the English in the world outside Europe. It 
is, in short, an attempt to explain the origin 
and development of the Empire as distinguished 
from the insular state. What we find in it is 
in no sense a history of the Empire but simply 
an elucidation of what the author conceives to 
have been the great guiding force in the 
Empire's creation. Mr, Peel's theory on this 
important matter is interesting, and inasmuch 
as the burden of his book is to substantiate this 
theory we may be allowed to sttte it in his own 
words. In one of his characteristic summaries, 
he says: 

' The Empire is the fruit of a long, deliberate, 
persistent, and conscious effort upon the part of 
our statesmen to avert the predominance of any 
European power. If this be so, then the policy of 
England, whether in the old world of Europe or in 
the continents without, stands explained as one 
coherent and consistent plan. Her maintenance of 
the balance of power in Europe and her construc- 
tion Oi an empire in the outer continents have 
been two aspects of the same design. . . . The 
first proposition [maintained in this book] is that 
European pressure from without is the cause of 
the formation of the empire; the second is that 
European pressure from without is the main cause 
of its maintenance. When that pressure increases, 
the empire tends to be consolidated; when it dimin- 
ishes, the empire tends to dissolve. Let it be added,

THE DIAL 



89 



however, that though this sense of common danger 
forms the empire's base, in our own day a true 
and mutual affection has flowered from this stern 
and stubborn root.' 

The thesis to be maintained is thus clearly 
laid down: it was the aggressions of European 
powers that forced England in the sixteenth 
century to enter upon the work of empire-build- 
ing and it is the rivalries and hostilities of 
these powers that has kept her at it ever since; 
imperial aggrandizement has been her only 
means of preserving her high rank among the 
nations. It need hardly be remarked that this 
view contrasts sharply with others which have 
been propounded by students of world politics. 
Sir John Seeley's idea, set forth in his lectures 
on the Expansion of England, has in recent 
vears been the generally ac-cepted one, namely, 
that the Empire has come to be what it is more 
or less by chance, without much deliberate plan- 
ning or definite policy. 'We have conquered 
and peopled half the world,' declared the Cam- 
bridge professor, ' in a fit of absence of mind.' 
A second empire grew up after the loss of the 
American colonies ' almost in our despite,' and 
' our acquisition of India was made blindly.' 
;Mr. Chamberlain, speaking in Liverpool in 
January of the present year, declared : ' We 
have never had a colonial policy; but, somehow 
or other, we have been allowed to blunder into 
the best parts of the world.' On the other hand, 
the general body of opinion on the continent 
of Europe is that, far from being the result of 
chance, the Empire is the fruit of the most 
deliberate and calculating policy, — of a reso- 
lute and unscrupulous determination to annex 
any part of the globe which can be laid hold of 
in order to swell British commerce and enhance 
British power and prestige. Mr. Peel under- 
takes to demonstrate that neither the ' accident ' 
theory of Seeley and Chamberlain nor the 
' insatiate avarice ' theory of the continental 
publicists affords the true explanation of the 
Empire's existence. To do this, and to sub- 
stantiate his own opinion that the Empire has 
been created deliberately as a means of defense 
against continental rivals, he consumes half a 
dozen chapters with a running sketch of the 
development of Greater Britain from its Eliza- 
bethan beginnings to our own day. He shows 
how it was only under the pressure of Spanish 
ascendancy in the late sixteenth centurj- (with 
the pressure of the French in Canada, the Por- 
tuguese in Africa, and the Dutch in the Spice 
Islands operating to the same end) that the 
English people began to realize the imperative 
necessity of empire. Having avoided terri- 
torial expansion as long as possible, they set to 
work at it only when they needs must. In 
Elizabethan times the efforts made were spas- 



modic, with the result of failure in every quar- 
ter ; but in the seventeenth century * the matter 
was taken definitely in hand, and as a conse- 
quence an empire was at length established on 
the shores and among the outlying islands of 
the continent of Xorth America, in defiance 
of the arms and authority of Spain. Simul- 
taneously our men of business gained for them- 
selves, with the consent and approval of our 
government, a foothold for trade in Hindostan. 
Here, too, Spain, or more accurately Portugal, 
then incorporated with Spain, opposed us, and 
Holland, the offshoot of the Spanish empire, 
acted similarly.' And when, finally, commer- 
cial exploitation gave place to political domina- 
tion in India, it was not accident, and not for 
greed of power, that the change of base was 
made. , 

' The genuine cause of the establishment of our 
sovereignty in India was that, during the first half 
of the eighteenth century and later, France 
appeared in overwhelming strength and the French 
colonies seriously threatened the English domin- 
ions in Hindostan. They resolutely attacked us; 
we defended ourselves for very life; as the conse- 
quence of that successful resistance India fell into 
our hands; the company could not hold it or organ- 
ize it unaided; the government undertook the obli- 
gation. Here was neither blindness nor rapacity. 
The Indian empire was a legitimate organization 
raised by us deliberately against the forward 
march of our European foe'. 

In thi^ manner the whole growth of the Em- 
pire is explained. Everywhere it has been ' not 
for loot, but for life,' that the English have 
struggled so persistently for dominion. If the 
period from about 1815 to 1870 was one of 
little expansive activity, — indeed, even a time 
of weakening faith in the usefulness of a colo- 
nial empire, — it was only because this was an 
era during which Europe was recovering from 
the Xapoleonic upheaval, and comparatively 
little was being done by any of the powers in 
the way of aggrandizement at English ex- 
pense. The last thirty-five years Mr. Peel re- 
gards as an epoch of renewed pressure. ' Con- 
scription has filled the barrack-yards of the 
continent; new navies dispute with us the 
roadway of the high seas; and, stirred by such 
transformations, anxiety has touched every 
nerve of the British race.' Hence the reorgan- 
ization and extension of the Empire in this 
period. The two most conspicuous factors in 
this renewed pressure Mr. Peel thinks to be the 
increase in the military power of Russia and 
the progress made by Germany with her fleet; 
for ' Germany and Eussia are now the claim- 
ants for the leadership of Europe, and there- 
fore most likely to come into contact with Eng- 
land, the immemorial guardian of the balance 
of power.' 

It cannot be denied that to the student of 



90 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



world-politics Mr. Peel's views, as well as his 
methods of demonstrating them, are richly sug- 
gestive; and 3^et it is impossible to repress the 
feeling that the theory underlying them is 
being pushed a good deal too far. The author 
at the outset unfortunately assumes the atti- 
tude of an advocate pleading a case, and this 
at once compromises his work on the score of 
judiciousness. ' The Empire has been the fruit, 
neither of chance nor of rapine, but of a vital 
and overwhelming necessity.' This is the 
thesis, and the whole range of British imperial 
history is laid under contribution to prove it. 
The task is achieved with a considerable de- 
gree of success, because up to a certain point 
the thesis is easily capable of defense. The 
difficulty is that Mr. Peel tries to carry his 
views too far, and is unfortunately prone to 
minimize, if not wholly to neglect, everything 
which stands in his way. There is enough 
truth and enough originality in his interpreta- 
tion of the Empire to have made his book an 
extraordinary one, if only he had not allowed 
this enthusiasm to get the better of his judg- 
ment. Axioms have little or no place in his- 
tory, and Mr. Peel has tried to reduce the 
whole of British imperial history to an axiom. 
The building of a great empire under modem 
conditions is a most complicated process, and 
it will not do to attempt to make all of its 
aspects and phases square with any one motive 
or method. Mr, Seeley erred somewhat in 
this direction; the continental publicists err 
more; and, if the truth be told, Mr. Peel goes 
furthest wrong of all. 

Yet ' The Friends of England ' is a valuable 
book. It brings out a phase of imperial poli- 
tics too much neglected by past writers. If 
one will only be on his guard against its in- 
discriminate generalizations, he can find in it 
a genuine stimulus to productive thought. In 
some ways the most striking portion of the 
work is the last two chapters, in which the in- 
terference of western peoples in the affairs of 
the Orient is reprobated in the language of the 
Chinese Ah Hok and defended from the view- 
point of Christendom.

Men and Movements op Modern 
En glan d.* 

The third volume of Mr. Herbert Paul's 
* History of Modem England ' covers the period 
from the death of Palmerston in 1865 to the 
second year of Disraeli's administration in 
1876. The principal topics treated are the fall

millan Co. 



of the Eussell-Gladstone ministry upon the 
question of an extension of the suffrage and 
Disraeli's famous ' education ' of his party upon 
this subject, the disestablishment of the Irish 
Church, the settlement of the Alabama claims, 
and the successful campaign for and establish- 
ment of an adequate system of public education. 

These are the topics customarily regarded as 
of principal importance in the period covered; 
but in addition much space is here given to 
special questions and incidents that from time 
to time agitated the Church of England, and 
occasionally excited as much noise in Parlia- 
ment itself as in purely clerical circles. In 
fact, the reader almost finds himself at times 
haled back to the period of the Eeformation, 
or to the complicated religious differences that 
stirred Stuart and Puritan England, yet with 
the distinction that in modern times in Eng- 
land Church questions do not determine the 
lines upon which political parties are formed. 
At first sight, the author's interest in these 
controversies, and the emphasis placed upon 
them throughout his work, appear to indicate a 
lack of true historical perspective; but it may 
well be that his purpose is to bring out, by 
detailing a series of Church controversies in 
themselves comparatively unimportant, the es- 
sential interest of Englishmen in the forms and 
ceremonies of their established Church. It is 
an attribute of the English character little 
understood and scarcely recognized by foreign 
writers, and Mr. Paul has at least made clear 
that the Church is in itself a living political 
question in parliamentary life. 

No historian can hope at this early date to 
characterize finally so recent an historical epoch 
as that of which Mr. Paul is writing. It is, in 
fact, impossible to judge as yet as to what 
events of the nineteenth century have been his- 
torically important in determining England's 
destiny or in moulding her character. It fol- 
lows, therefore, that all that is possible to offer 
is an accurate and readable summary of those 
events that have been regarded as important by 
contemporaries. Thus Mr. Paul's work reads 
at times as if it were an abstract or a compila- 
tion from some periodical publication like the 
^Annual Eegister.' Yet it is more than this, 
for in the midst of his narrative the author 
interjects sentences, or parts of sentences, that 
light up the mere summary of event with 
flashes of individual analysis, serving to give 
the author's opinion of incidents and of men. 
These constitute the really valuable portion of 
the work; for Mr. Paul is a shrewd observer, 
has ideas of his own, and does not hesitate to 
express them. Whether one agrees with him 
or not, it is worth while to know what those 
opinions are.

Another interesting feature of the work is 
the admiration expressed for and credit given 
to the men who did not stand at the head of 
political parties, though interested in politics, 
but who by genius and hard work had influ- 
ence upon important aspects of English life. 
Historians are somewhat prone to eliminate 
from their works the lesser men of politics, 
though these may have rendered distinguished 
services to the country. But Mr. Paul, who 
has been a Member of Parliament and also a 
journalist, imderstands better than do the pro- 
fessional historians the minor influences that 
are constantly brought to bear upon the great 
leaders of parties, and gives full credit to such 
men as Mill in educational reform. Lord Acton 
in religious controversies, or Joseph Arch in 
forwarding the interests of the agricultural 
laborers. Gladstone and Disraeli naturally 
require much attention; but here also the 
author is not content with an examination of 
their political services merely, but expresses his 
own opinion of their abilities in other fields of 
action and of thought. England is just begin- 
ning to realize the essential genius of Disraeli, 
and the recent celebration of the centenary of 
his birth has aroused a wide-spread revival of 
interest in his strange character. Probably Mr. 
Paul is to some extent unconsciously voicing 
this newly arisen belief in Disraeli's greatness, 
when, unlike most previous writers, he neglects 
to damn, and sometimes even consents to praise, 
the illustrious Jew. 

In a brief notice of the first and second 
volumes of this work (The Dial, April 16, 
1904) it was said, apropos of the author's lau- 
dation of Peel and Free-trade, and referring to 
the Chamberlain policy of quasi-protection now 
being urged in England : ' It will be interesting 
to note whether Mr. Paul will attempt in the 
remaining volumes of his work to point a moral 
applicable to the present interesting political 
situation in England, — whether, in fact, his 
history is a genuine historical undertaking or a 
bit of political propaganda.' The present vol- 
ume clearly indicates that no such propaganda 
is intended. Mr, Paul is offering, very success-

A good book Of the mob of gentlemen who 

of essays for write with 6886, Mr, Henry W. 

the hammock. Nevlnson is one of the most facile 
as well ais one of the most entertaining. In his 
'Books and Personalities' (John Lane) he assures 
the reader at the outset that he has 'included 
onlj' such subjects as are quite familiar to every- 
one who cares for literature at all,' and that 
every name dealt with 'is regarded with admira- 
tion, and sometimes even with personal affection, 
bj- nearly all readers.' It is indeed pleasant to 
read the essayist's graceful and often witty 
discourse on subjects endeared by familiarity ; but 
how many, we wonder, on both sides of the 
Atlantic, can call themselves admirers and lovers 
of old Jocelin of Brakelond, or of that priest of 
the slums, Father Dolling, who died three years 
ago, or of the Irish poets Clarence Mangan and 
'A. E.'? These and other men and things are 
discussed in Mr, Nevinson's brief chapters, of 
which he tells us that many have already appeared 
in periodicals. He writes in a brisk, self-confident, 
effective way, with no lack of plausible general- 
izations (not based on painfully exhaustive col- 
lection of particulars) and a ready supply of apt 
illustrations. The odd twist given to a popular 
quotation is sometimes very clever in its place, 
as, 'Thoughts that do often lie too deep for 
laughter. ' Himself an ardent Omarian, the essay- 
ist asserts that 'there must be hundreds of 
Englishmen who can say the whole of those [Fitz- 
Gerald's] verses by heart, without even a slip 
in their sequence.' Doubtless there are thousands 
in England and America who can repeat an 
occasional line or even stanza; but that hundreds 
could reproduce the poem verbatim, should it 
ever be lost, is doubtful, such havoc has an 
increasingly productive printing-press wrought 
with our memories. Our English friend betrays 
a curious conception of the anatomy of a certain 
much-dreaded American serpent, when, ever on 
the look-out for a striking illustration, he writes 
in reference to persons of vehement intolerance,— 
'Who has not at some time seen those rattle- 
snakes raise their heads and heard the tremulous 
threatening of their scales?' As short essays in 
criticism of the lighter sort, these chapters, despite 
a slight tendency to the dogmatic in their tone, 
are excellent reading. 

Social life in *A little history of American 

the Colonies of life' is the descriptive sub-title 
North America, ^hidj jjj.. George Carv Eggleston 
gives to his volume entitled 'Our First Century' 
(A. S. Barnes & Co.). Covering only the seven- 
teenth century of American history, it is evidently 
intended to be one of a series dealing with colonial 
life, especially in its social aspects. It is addressed 
to readers who are too mature for the brief text- 
books on colonial history and cannot afford the 
expenditure of time and money necessary to 
read the larger histories. The author proposes 
to deal with our colonial fathers,— 'what manner 
of men they were, the ideas they brought with 
them across the sea, the mistakes they made upon

entering upon a new life under strange conditions, 
the means they adopted of adjusting themselves 
to their new environment, the forces that gave 
form to their systems of government, the occupa- 
tions in which they engaged, their religious 
beliefs, their amusements, the clothes they wore 
and the food they ate. ' A careful reading leaves 
one with the impression that the novelties here 
set forth are to be found in a few concluding 
chapters, and that the larger part of the little 
volume is given to a re-telling of the familiar 
facts of colonial history, although in most charm- 
ing language. The planting of the different 
colonies is described in chronological order, the 
Indian wars are treated in detail, and the 
struggles for the colonial charters set forth. Upon 
certain points the author has decided opinions. 
'The little colony of Rhode Island was the only 
region on this great continent where any such 
thing as real and unrestrained religious liberty 
and the absolute equality of men before the law, 
as we now understand these things, were fully 
recognized. ' In another chapter we are told that 
'Virginia did indeed decree the banishment of 
dissenters from the established religion, but the 
decree was never very rigorously enforced. In 
none of the other colonies did religion so dom- 
inate the minds of men or so control their social 
relations as it did in the Puritan commonwealths. ' 
An appendix contains a rather novel comparative 
outline of important events arranged in parallel 
columns for England and the different groups of 
colonies. 

BiogrwpTiy of I^ his preface to the life of Joseph 
a musician Joachim, the latest volume in the 

and a gentleman. 'Living Masters of Music' series 
(John Lane), Mr. J. A. Fuller Maitland points 
out that it is perhaps right that panegyric should 
be the prevailing note of contemporary biogra- 
phy; it is, at all events, much easier to discount 
praise than blame, and one gets a far more vivid 
picture from the man who admires his subject, 
even if it be with only the foolish admiration of 
a Boswell, than through the atmosphere of hardly 
concealed invective in which some modem biog- 
raphers have chosen to shroud the figure they 
represent. 'If superlatives are spread too thick 
over individuals whose ultimate position in the 
history of art must at present be a little uncer- 
tain, what terms are to be employed in speaking 
of one whose place among the immortals of music 
has long been an accepted fact? If the language 
of praise has been exhausted over a Gossec or a 
Steibelt, how shall we write of a Haydn or a 
Beethoven? But if it is difficult to find words 
that shall unite a judicial impartiality with ade- 
quate appreciation, it cannot be other than a 
grateful task to attempt to write even a short 
sketch of a life so full of dignity, usefulness, 
and beauty, as that of Joseph Joachim.' Born 
at Kitsee, near Pressburg, in Germany, June 28, 
1831, Joachim was brought up in the Jewish 
faith, in which he remained until 1854, when he 
embraced the Christian religion. In 1844 he made 
his debut in England, an event which the 'Illus- 
trated London News' thus chronicled: 'But now 



we come to the dictu mirabile monstTrum in the 
shape of a little boy of thirteen, who perhaps is 
the first violin player, not only of his age, but of 
his siScle.' As a teacher, Joachim has had a long 
and honorable career; and his numerous compo- 
sitions prove an exception to the rule that it is 
impossible to maintain interpretative skill at the 
highest level and at the same time develope 
creative genius. The book is eminently worthy 
of perusal, for in our practical worship of bril- 
liancy we sometimes forget that character — integ- 
rity, dignity, courtesy, loyalty, and truth— is as 
desirable as most kinds of success. Joachim is 
here shown as a man with the best instincts of 
the scholar and the manners of a gentleman. 

A guide to Like all publications of the New 
the art of York State Library, Miss Wheeler's 

mdex-making. ^jqqJ^ q^ Indexing comes to us with 
our confidence secure in advance. Mr. Dewey's 
name upon it is the seal and sign of the court of 
highest jurisdiction in matters of library economy 
and kindred arts. As a text-book for active in- 
dexers, or for classes in indexing, this pamphlet 
meets all requirements. Miss Wheeler's broad 
experience, both as indexer and teacher, has 
brought her system to the highest point of ex- 
cellence in directness of mechanical methods and 
in thoroughness of description and illustration of 
every detail. Her literary taste, her patience 
and tact, her quiet discrimination and sense of 
proportion, contribute to produce a comprehen- 
sive and truly helpful manual. No possible ques- 
tion that could occur to instructor or student is 
carelessly discussed or neglected. From the 
moment of opening the book to be indexed 
until the time of returning the corrected proof 
to the printer, the author provides for every 
contingency, with rules, suggestions, reasons, 
illustrations, and some awful examples. A 
number of indexes of conspicuous merit are sug- 
gested for examination, and several pages of in- 
teresting and suggestive extracts from indexes of 
widely divergent subject-matter are given as ex- 
amples of form and typographical arrangement. 
Needless to say, the present work is provided with 
an index which is in itself an admirable example 
of the art. The future indexer may well test his 
fitness for his chosen calling by a perusal of this 
book. He may learn that unless he can say 
'blessed be drudgery' he has missed his voca- 
tion; that the price paid for the attainment of 
perfection in this work is the virtue of a never- 
ceasing patience and an eternal vigilance. But 
in addition he may find as reward various de- 
lightful excursions into countless worlds of 
thought and numberless vistas of enchantment. 



Greek Art Painting and sculpture, like poetry 
grammatically and prose, are the expression of 
treated. thought in a language whose gram- 

mar must be studied in order to understand their 
meaning. To understand a work of art, we must 
consider not merely what it represents in fact, 
but also the conventions of the artist as deter- 
mined by the period in which he lived, his school, 
and the range of his ideas. Hence it is that Pro- 



1905.] 



THE DIAL 



fessor Percy Gardner, Litt.D., of Oxford, calls his 
handbook of the study of Greek art, 'A Gram- 
mar of Greek Art' (Maemillau). To the acci- 
dence of the Greek lau.£ruage he compares the 
simple laws iu art, of relation to material, of 
relation to space, of balance and of proportion, 
mieonseiously observed by the Greek artists. To 
syntax he compares the relation of scene to scene, 
of picture to myth and to literature, of sculpture 
and coin to history. The analogy between Greek 
art and Greek literature he traces still further. 
The Greeks borrowed from the Phoenicians and 
others the letters of the alphabet and used them 
to convey their own ideas in their own language 
and according to the rules of their own grammar. 
So they began their artistic activity by bon-ow- 
ing from the nations around them, or perhaps 
from the primitive dwellers in their own land, 
certain simple fonns, and using them to embody 
their own notions of decoration, their own reli- 
gious beliefs, and the tales of their ancestral 
heroes. By elucidating these principles of inter- 
pretation (which by the way, are not original 
with him) in sixteen chapters on the architectm-e, 
the sculpture, the painting and the coins of the 
Greeks, the learned author contributes to the 
series of 'Handbooks of Arohaeology and Antiq- 
uities' a valuable volimie whose only fault is 
that it fails as an attempt to provide an elemen- 
tary study of the subject, and presupposes consid- 
erable classical training on the part of the reader. 

^ , In 'The Psvchology of Beaut v' 
Tse^uZ (Houghton), 'Miss Ethel D. Puff"er 
attempts to fonnulate an aesthetic 
system that shall command universal acceptance 
and bring peace at last to the warring camps of 
impressionists' and dogmatists, symbolists and 
formalists, moralists and exponents of the *Art 
for Art's Sake' propaganda. Philosophy, Miss 
Puffer tells us, has always made the mistake of 
holding its theories of beauty too far aloof from 
the actual, the concrete instance; whereas so- 
called aesthetic criticism, of which recent years 
have been so prolific, is generally written quite 
without regard to any central principle, and the 
same sad lack of system prevails among investi- 
gators of that other modern science — the physi- 
ological psychology of aesthetic emotions. 'The 
Psychology of Beauty' seeks to remedy this state 
of things. It propounds an original aesthetic 
formula based upon the currently accepted theorj- 
of emotion, and explains this formula and makes 
it intelligible and useful by tracing its applica- 
tion to three of the fine arts — music, painting, 
and literature. Miss Puffer's metho<l of treat- 
ment is precise and logical without being over- 
technical, and her development of her theme in 
con-elated essays, each fairly independent of the 
others, lessens the strain upon the attention of 
the general reader. This is not the place to dis- 
cuss the validity of Miss Puffer's conclusions, still 
less to enter upon the familiar contention of the 
possibility of an authoritative canon of taste 
such as she proposes to establish. We can only 
commend Miss Puffer's lai-ge grasp of her subject 
and consequent fitness for the Avork she has taken 



in hand, — a work which, because of its novel 
direction and its thoroughly modern methods, 
demand attention from students of aesthetics. 



Spanish jj^.^ Martin Hume, in his recent work 

on English ^^ 'Spanish Influence on English 
literature. Litei'ature' (Lippineott's), has pub- 
lished a series of popular lectures without adding 
materially to what is already known on his sub- 
ject. The two Columbia University dissertations, 
by Mr. Underbill on 'Spanish Literature in the 
England of the Tudors' and by Mr. Chandler on 
'Romances of Roguery,' have treated limited por- 
tions of the subject with far greater fulness than 
Mr. Hume has done, and fail to include very little 
that is essential in his treatment. The two great 
periods of Spanish influence were embraced by 
the reigns of the Tudors and the Stuarts. If Mr. 
Hume had worked out the Stuart period as fully 
as Mr. Underbill did the Tudor period, and had 
then given a comprehensive view of the Spanish 
influence in its entirety, he would have met a 
much-felt want. The book, moreover, seems to be 
pervaded by an exaggerated sense of the impor- 
tance of its thesis. Anything Spanish in English 
literature is unduly emphasized. Often it was 
only the names that were Spanish, as in Kyd's 
plays; yet Mr. Hume assumes this as showing 
sti-ong Spanish influence. It sometimes meant 
only that interest in Spain was in the air. Tlie 
'Spanish Tragedy' is Spanish in nothing more 
than name. Since Mr. Hume has limited himself 
to a strictly popular treatment of his subject, one 
cannot but regret that he did not devote a chapter 
to a consideration of the real significance of the 
Spanish influence, what it contributed of perma- 
nent value, as in the case of the picaresque 
novel, as well as what was of more fleeting con- 
sequence. A broad philosophic and aesthetic view 
of the field would have had interest, and would 
not have been without value as criticism. 



New essavs Bishop Spalding has long since 
by Bishop made his mark as a forceful and 
Spalding. suggestive thinker, whether his 

thoughts are formulated for oral expression or 
solely for the printed page. The essay from 
whiA his latest volume takes its name — 'Reli- 
gion and Art' (A. C. McClurg & Co.)— will 
doubtless provoke much dissent from the view- 
point of the artist, because of its insistence on 
the necessity of a distinct moral purpose in all 
great works of art; but he has yet to learn the 
very alphabet of wise reading who does not know 
that the most profitable lessons are often to be 
gained from that with which it is impjossible 
wholly to agree. After this essay comes the 
address on 'Educational Ideals' which Dr. Spald- 
ing delivered before the International Congress 
of Arts and Sciences at St. Louis during the 
Exposition. The keynote of this address lies in 
the introductory thesis, that so far as education 
is concerned, the material prc^rress of any age 
is merely incidental and subordinate to its intel- 
lectual, moral, and religious development. The 
volume contains, further, an essay on 'The Mean- 
insr of Education,' the address delivered at the

[August 16, 



memorial services in honor of Dr. N. S. Davis, 
and an essay on 'Social Questions,' in which the 
ground is maintained that the disorders arising 
between capital and labor are due to a general 
letting down in the moral tone of society, and are 
therefore to be relieved by the cultivation of 
nobler efforts and more spiritual aims. 

Paris and Mr. Alvan F. Sanborn's 'Paris and 
the Social the Social Revolution' (Small, 
Revolution. Maynard & Co.) contains a descrip- 
tive history of all the revolutionary types in 
French society, from the red anarchist and the 
revolutionary socialist to the moderate Bohemians 
of the Latin Quarter and the advocates of 
advanced theories in poetry, music, and art. It 
does not require a large stretch of imagination to 
see how Zola and Mirabeau may be associated 
with Jean Grave and Elisee Reclus as preachers 
and teachei-s of social revolution. But when 
Cazin, Rodin, Charpentier,— all the leaders in 
French literary and artistic activity,— are 
included in the number, it makes the leaders look 
less red-handed. Mr. Sanborn's development of 
the revolutionary spirit in modern art, and his 
application of it to dozens of well-known cases, 
is no more interesting than his description of the 
declared anarchist and socialist types and tenets. 
The power of the chanson, the romantic figure 
of the wandering revolutionary or trimardeur, 
the bold support of party newspapers at the risk 
of life and freedom, the varied methods of propa- 
ganda, by example, by writing, orally,— all are 
well portrayed. Moreover, the humor, the sym- 
pathy, and the proportion that characterize Mr. 
Sanborn's attitude give color to his assertion 
that he is not a revolutionist, though there are 
moments when he 'fancies he would like to be 
one, it appears such an eminently satisfying 
state.' The book gains an added vividness and 
charm from the illustrations by Vaughan Trow- 
bridge. 

Notes. 



' The Story of the Merchant of Venice,' retold 
for children by Miss Alice Spencer Hoffman, is 
published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

' Eadium Explained ' is the ambitious title of a 
little book by Dr. W. Hampson, published by 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead, & Co. in the ' Practical Science 
Series. ' 

A beautifully printed volume from the press of 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. gives us * A 
Bibliography of Nathaniel Hawthorne,' compiled bj' 
Miss Nina E. Browne. The work is particularly 
rich in references to periodical literature. 

A free but exquisite translation of ' The Elegies 
of Tibullus ' comes to us from the press of Mr. 
Richard G. Badger. It is the work of that ripe 
scholar, the Rev. Theodore C. Williams, and de- 
serves a warm welcome from classical students and 
lovers of poetry alike. 

' Who Was He?' by Mr. Edward Latham, is a 
concise dictionary of general biography, published 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., who also send us a 
companion volume of * Mottoes and Badges,' com- 
piled by Mr. W. S. W. Anson. These are volumes 
in ' Routledge's Miniature Reference Library.' 



One of the most important books of the late 
Edward Moran was the series of thirteen marine 
paintings descriptive of important events in Ameri- 
can history, now on exhibition at the Metropolitan 
Museum in New York. These paintings are now 
reproduced in a volume, with descriptive text and 
commentary by Mr. Theodore Sutro, and published 
by the Baker & Taylor Co. The book is entitled 
' Thirteen Chapters of American History,' and con- 
tains also portraits of Edward Moran and his wife, 
besides a memoir of the artist. The subjects of 
the paintings range from the landing of Leif Erik- 
son (unhappily misprinted ' Lief ') to the return of 
the battleships from the Spanish-American War. 
They constitute a collection of impressive beauty, 
aside from their function of illustrating some of 
the most striking phases of American history. 

We have to chronicle the appearance of six new 
volumes in the * Belles Lettres Series ' of Messrs. 
D. C. Heath & Co. To the Old English section of 
the series there are now added editions of ' Juliana,' 
edited by Professor William Strunk; * Judith,' 
edited by Professor Albert S. Cook, and ' The 
Battle of Maiden,' with short poems from the 
' Chronicle,' edited by Dr. Walter John Sedgefield. 
The other three volumes here to be mentioned are 
Robertson's ' Society ' and ' Caste,' edited by Mr. 
T. Edgar Pemberton, Chapman's' Bussy o ' Ambois ' 
and its sequel, edited by Professor Frederick S. 
Boas; and ' Selected Poems by Algernon Charles 
Swinburne,' edited by Dr. William Morton Payne. 
While the volumes of this series are primarily 
intended for college use, we may suggest that the 
issues of the more modern works provide con- 
venient editions for the general reader and the 
private collector. The Swinburne volume, in par- 
ticular, will be welcome to many readers as pro- 
viding, in small compass and at a nominal price, a 
classified selection of the author's greatest poems.

1905] THE DTATi 99 

THOMAS HARDY'S 

Complete Works 

IN TWENTY VOLUMES 



THE best critics of England and America are united in aflBrming that Thomas Hardy will 
occupy a permanent place in English Literature. There is a vigor and virility about his 
work, a rude strength, a portrayal of men whose blood runs quick and red, and of women 
whose primal passions make them kin to all healthy women of the world, an amazing command of 
expression, the power to tell a story with direct, straightforward, dramatic force, chargfing like a 
storm through the pages — all of which place Hardy among the greatest story-tellers. 

Is there a better story anywhere than Tess of the D' Urbervilles f The author calls it " the 
story of a pure woman," and in spite of her fall she is that. It is a novel splendidly heroic in 
execution, terrific in its stress, surcharged with passion, and of enduring and immortal interest. 
The London Academy says : " It brands itself upon the mind with the touch of incandescent 
iron." The story, subdued for the stage, drew great audiences in America and throughout Europe. 
Messrs. Habpeb &, Brotheks announce the publication of the new "Wessex Editiok of 
Thomas Hardy's works in twenty volumes — the only complete edition of the famous novelist's works. 

TITLES OF THE VOLUMES

Irrigfation is Independence 

In working unirrigated land, the farmer is dependent for success on moisture and sunshine. 
Irrigation makes him independent of rain, but he needs light and heat. In the Yellowstone 
Valley the sun shines 300 days out of the 365. See the point? The land is rich, markets and 
transportation facilities of the best. 

" The Yellowstone VaUey is noted for its large strawberries, luscious raspberries, and richly 
flavored blackberries. Apples of the finest quality are grown. Pears, grapes, plums, and cherries 
are harvested in great profusion. The people make big displays of tomatoes, sweet potatoes, 
hops, and flowers at the annual county fairs." It is traversed by the 

Northern Pacific Railway 

Irrigated lands in this valley produce per acre per year as follows : 
Alfalfa, three crops, 5 to 7 tons. Oats, one crop, 40 to 90 bushels, machine measure. 

Timothy, one crop, 2i tons. Barley, one crop, 40 to 60 bushels, machine measure. 

Potatoes, one crop, 300 to 600 bushels. 
Hundreds of thousands of acres of land along the Northern Pacific Railway in North Dakota, 
Montana, and Washington are and will be made available for cultivation by government and 
private irrigation projects. Write for maps and pamphlets to C. W. Mott, General Emigration 
Agent, St. Paul. One way Colonist tickets at greatly reduced rates on sale September 
15-October 31. Ask about round trip Homeseekers' tickets. Regarding rates and train service

CLANNISH CEITICISM. 

The poetry of Thoma.s Moore has recently 
been brought into the foreground of critical 
disciLssion, partly by the appearance of Mr. 
Stephen Gwynn's contribution to the ' English 
Men of Letters ' series, partly by the transla- 
tion of a youthful volume of Dr. Georg 
Brandes dealing with the English poetic re- 
vival of the early nineteenth century. Both 
books give to Moore a higher place than may 
fairly be claimed for him, the reasons being, re- 
spectively, that one is the work of an Irishman, 
and the other the work of a foreigner. We 
mean by this last statement that even as well- 
equipped a foreign critic as Dr. Brandes can 
never penetrate far enough into the spirit of 
English poetry to appreciate its finer cadences 
and emotional values, but must ever remain 
exposed to the danger of mistaking tinkle for 
music, and tinsel for gold. The reviewers, 
naturally, have fallen afotil of these exaggerated 
estimates, and have pointed out their uncritical 
character. No less naturally, the reviewers 
have in turn been assailed by numbers of ex- 
cited Irishmen, and a very pretty controversy 
has resulted. 

Some score of years ago, Matthew Arnold 
got himself into the same sort of trouble as 
these reviewers, with the difference that, in- 
stead of Irishmen, he had to reckon with the 
complaints of Scotchmen. He had rashly at- 
tempted a strictly dispassionate analysis of the 
poetry of Bums, and had come to the temper- 
ate conclusion that this poetry had 'truth of 
matter and truth of manner, but not the ac- 
cent or the poetic virtue of the highest mas- 
ters.' But his aggrieved Scotch critics could 
never forgive him for saying that 'Burns's 
world of Scotch drink, Scotch religion, and 
Scotch manners is often a harsh, a sordid, a 
repulsive world,' and that a Scotchman, being 
used to it, ' has a tenderness for it.' In this 
case, as in the more recent case of Moore, the 
spirit of clannishness took the place of an im- 
partial effort to get at the truth, and prejudice 
was invoked to the confusion of judgment. 

It may well be that Arnold, in that famous 
essay on ' The Study of Poetry,' was not alto- 
gether fair to Burns, and it may be that our 
recent reviewers have not done complete justice 
to those qualities of Moore that have so en- 
deared him to his compatriots, but it is ob- 
vious that the critic whose outlook is not nar- 



104

[Sept. 1, 



rowed b}'^ such racial prepossessions as prevail 
with Scotchmen when Burns is in question, or 
with Irishmen when Moore is in question, is 
likely to be the critic whose judgment will prove 
finally acceptable to intelligent readers. He at 
least is impersonal, and they as certainly are 
not. Tlie sort of eulogy that Irishmen heap 
upon Moore, and Scotchmen upon Burns, upon 
the occasion of their festive gatherings, has its 
value for promoting good fellowship and bright- 
ening the glow of mutual sympathy, but does 
not commend itself to the cooler judgment of 
mankind at large, or even of the participants in 
these love-feasts when they come to think it 
ever with themselves. 

These are but two specific illustrations of the 
clannish habit which is so prejudicial to the 
interests of rational criticism. Whenever or 
wherever any group of men is held together by 
a common bond of sympathy, the tendency to 
€xalt their own efforts will be made manifest. 
The bond may be racial, or it may be the bond 
of a religious, social, or political organization, 
or it may be no stronger bond than results 
from contiguity and the community of mate- 
rial interests, but the outcome will be the same 
in all the cases. If the group is large enough 
to find literary expression, its members will 
instinctively unite in glorifying the product, 
and in reviling the captious dissenter. ' Be- 
hold what we can do ' will be its vaunt, and any 
attempts to belittle its achievement will be set 
down to the score of envy on the part of the 
distanced rival. 

The results of this clannishness are sometimes 
pathetically amusing. ^%at could be more so, 
for example, than collections of the poets and 
poetry of this or that state or county, than 
anthologies of the gems of thought inspired by 
this or that religious persuasion. Let a Cath- 
olic, or a Methodist, or a Unitarian produce a 
book, and straightway all the voices and or- 
gans of his kind will sing its praises. Let some 
frontier town discover an author in its midst, 
and its spokesmen will promptly view them- 
selves as denizens of the coming literary cen- 
tre of the country. Tested by the even scale of 
criticism, these phenomena may be utterly in- 
significant, but the loaded scales of eectarian or 
provincial prejudice will show them to weigh 
heavily enough. The favorite preacher be- 
comes a Chrysostom, the popular orator a 
Demosthenes, the budding novelist a Dickens 
or a Scott, the boudoir poet a Tennyson or a 
Keats, and all homely barnyard fowl in general 
become swans and peacocks and birds of para- 
dise. 

All these provincialisms and exhibitions of 
the clan-spirit have little enough to do with real 
-criticism, but nevertheless they work no small 



amount of mischief. There is no praivse so 
foolish that it will not be taken at its face value 
by readers already predisposed in favor of the 
work which is praised, and no writer too poor 
to be puffed up by such ill-judged adulation. 
Thus the feeble amateur is persuaded to think 
himself a genius, and the innocent public is 
practiced upon to the confusion of its sense of 
proportion. The effect is pernicious in both 
ways; it may turn a good farmer or carpenter 
into a bad poet or novelist, and it is sure to 
waste the time of many misguided readers upon 
productions unworthy of their attention. These 
literary idols of the market-place are responsi- 
ble for much perversion of the true faith. 

After all, these critical judgments of the clan- 
nish kind merely illustrate in an intensified 
form the subjective theory of criticism. If 
there are no such things as standards, if the 
individual recognizes no test of excellence save 
his own likes and dislikes, then these narrow or 
provincial opinions are amply justified. One 
may say of a piece of literary composition, ' It 
gives me pleasure, therefore it must be deserv- 
ing of praise,' and it will be hard to convince 
him that the conclusion stands in the relation 
of non seqidtur to the premise. If such a per- 
son may say further, ' It gives me pleasure, 
and also pleases all the others of my sort,' the 
argument is clinched, and there is no gainsay- 
ing the strength of the position. Yet the de- 
cision of real criticism, which may reject the 
work in the face of however clamorous a mob, 
rests, and must inevitably rest, upon a very dif- 
ferent basis. It must rest upon the concensus 
of opinion, not of the group that affects the 
work in question, but of the trained minds 
here and there that bring no prejudice to their 
inspection, and render their verdict in a spirit 
of absolute intellectual detachment. It is only 
a judgment thus pronounced that can impose 
itself upon the world at large, and be regis- 
tered as beyond appeal. 



THE TONIC OF GEORGE MEREDITH'S 
P OETR Y. 

A frequent mood with Mr. Meredith, as he 
greets his readers, is that of challenge. This is 
sometimes covertly mingled with portraiture. 
As he introduces Diana Warwick, Lady Blan- 
dish, Sir Willoughby, or Hippias, he seems to 
ask your mental attitude toward cultured or 
sentimental women, toward sturdy egoists or 
puny dyspeptics. Again, he summons you to 
defend, if you have the temerity, national 
^ graft' as unfolded in the opening chapters of 
' Beauchamp's Career.' He may defy you to 
pass severe judgment on such a desperado patriot 



1905.] 



THE DIAL

as ' The Old Chartist." Xotably, in his poems, 
the call is to personal searching of mind and 
soul, — ^the familiar couplet of invitation to 
enter the enchanted Woods of Westermain, 
' Ye who dare,' or the s}Tnbolic tone of ' Hard 
Weather,' — 

' Interpret me the savage ■whirr. 

Behold the life at ease : it drifts ; 

The sharpened life commands its course.' 

As novelist and poet alike, Mr. Meredith 
often seems to deter rather than to encourage 
his readers first ventures within his pages. The 
very difficulties of approach by tortuous and 
brambly by-paths may increase the zeal with 
which one penetrates, if he has persistence, into 
the innermost passages of matchless revelation. 
It has been asserted that his poetry is the fitting 
medium of entrance into hi^ prose. Through 
his verse his personality, mental and spiritual, 
is unfolded; within his poems one may find 
possible interpretation for some of the most 
baffling enigmas of thought in his fiction. It 
is true that much of his poetry is more elusive, 
more freighted with artful metaphor than his 
prose. The reader is daunted by many metrical 
mazes in both thought and structure; yet, in 
spite of the dimness of direct meaning, there 
breathes a tonic, * like a whiff of heather,' 
"which nourishes brain and soul and spurs one 
on to reach and penetrate the veiled recesses. 
For the weakling in spirit, Mr. Meredith offers 
no heart-easing songs ; for the mental dyspeptic, 
he has no pre-digested literary foods. His 
favorite men and women are normal in appetite 
and sleep. For sentimental women he has a 
fund of biting sarcasm : recall his portrayal of 
^Irs. Caroline Grandison who 'had relapsed 
upon religion and little dogs.' For healthy 
emotions, Mr. Meredith has poetic tribute. Sen- 
timentality he ' would squeeze out of the world,' 
whether it is exampled in ' rose pink ' ecstasies 
or ' dirty drab ' naturalism. As poet and novel- 
ist, he urges a sane aspect toward life. ' Phil- 
osophy is foe of rose pink and dirty drab and 
their silly cancelling effects. Philosophy bids 
us see that we are not as pretty as rose pink, 
nor as repulsive as dirty drab, and instead of 
everlastingly shifting these barren aspects the 
sight of ourselves is wholesome, bearable, fruc- 
tifying, finally a delight.' 

In Mr. Meredith's poetic fancies and medita- 
tions, in his roadside philosophies like ' Grand- 
father Bridgeman ' and ' Juggling Jerry,' in his 
varied' paneg}Tics of nature from 'Seed-Time' 
to ' Spirit of Earth in Autumn,' in his tragic 
or idyllic love-poems from 'The ?^uptials of 
Attila ' and ' Archduchess Anne ' to ' Love in 
the Yalley," one reads the underlying exalta- 
tion of the elemental, exercised with sane re- 



straints. Xature, bounteous, vital, wise, is the 
model teacher in love, in work, in life. 

' But not tUl Nature's laws and man's are one. 
Can marriage of the man and woman be.' 

With fine, apt insight, Mr. Meredith adapts 
his nature analogies to his varied characters. 
Juggling Jerry finds joyful tonic in ' smells of 
the gorse, so nutty, gold like and warm.' The 
Beggar's refreshment is 

' To lie all alone on a ragged heath. 

Where your nose isn't sniffling for bones or bear. 

But a peat-fire smells like a garden beneath.' 

Suited to the romantic trend of 'Grandfather 
Bridgeman ' is the delicate lyric of spring and 
of love, scarcely equalled in modem verse. 

• "rhe day was a Tan-bird of summer : the robin still 

piped but the blue, 
A warm and dreamy palace with voices of larks ringing 

thro', 
L«ok'd down as if wistfully eyeing the blossoms that fell 

from its lap ; 
A day to sweeten the juices, 
A day to quicken the sap I 
All round the shadowy orchard sloped meadows in gold. 

and the dear 
Shy violets breathed their hearts out, the maiden breath 

of the year.' 

Earth and man must be in perfect accord. 
To read Earth aright, says Mr. Meredith, to 
profit by its teachings, man must come into 
close contact with it, he must give trustful and 
sympathetic obedience to its laws. Earth is 
the true balancer of ratios of life. To one 
thus in alignment with Nature's laws and pur- 
poses will come healthy physical activity, nor- 
mal emotions, balanced mind and hopeful spir- 
it. That strange poem, — a modern Bacchanal, 
as it has well been called, — 'Jump to Glory 
Jane,' is no mere travesty on muscular Chris- 
tianity. It impUes a moral as well as a comic 
muse. ' Jane though a jumping was a thought- 
ful woman,' and to her last days of happiness 
and trust, her creator commends each reader. 
On the other hand, in ' The Two Masks,' the 
stor}- of Melpome and Thaleia, is found the 
teaching of normal desires for all humanitv, — 
that they 

' strive never to outleap our human features. 
And do Right Reason's ordinance obey.' 

If we bend our ears to catch the meaning of the 
seasons as they pass, if we sympathize with 
the moods of the months, f retfulness will change 
to serene svmpathy; so shall we, 

' Like Mother Xature, 

Kiss the season and shun regrets,' 

When such a unity of spirit has been attained, 
the southwest wind, roaring, dashing in fury, 
brings a message of use and beauty no less as- 
suring than the charm of woodland peace. To 
such, the dr}- sedges sing a spiritual song. To 
such, the thrush in February or the lark as- 
cending in ravished joy in full spring-tide ut- 
ters a similar strain:

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



' 'Tis love of earth that he instils ! 
And ever ringing up and up, 
Our valley is his golden cup. 
And he the wind which overflows. 
To lift us with him as he goes.' 

With no distinct preachment on religion, 
Mr. Meredith brings his doctrine of sympathy 
with Nature to a logical and spiritual climax. 
Accord with Nature's laws will bring surety of 
a future which is not clearly revealed in vision 
but is assuredly promised by the processes of 
Mother Earth. 'Look you with your soul, 
you see it.' AVhile he asserts no spiritual enti- 
ties, he emphasizes through halting mystic 
metres, or more simple lyrics, his comfort in a 
' Right of things' here and hereafter. Looking 
out upon the downs and hills which surround 
his Surrey home, he said to a visitor, ' How can 
any man live near to this — near to Nature, I 
mean not only this beautiful inanimate Nature, 
but near to human nature — and not live hope- 
fully ? ' In no other of his lines does the reader 
come so intimately in touch with the man and 
the poet as in 'A Faith on Trial,' the cry of 
the riven soul after the death of his wife, when 
doubt and darkness are scattered and the soul 
recovers its harmony with the Infinite by the 
chance sight of a pure white cherry blossom, 
awakening sacred associations with the happy 
and trustful years that the two souls had passed 
together. After an experience of a similar 
sort, if of diverse expression, the soul of man 
proclaims a future: 

' Near is he to great Nature in the thought 
Each changing Season intimately saith, 
That nought save apparition knows the death ; 

To the God-lighted mind of man 'tis nought.' 

With yet more direct and emphatic word speaks 
' Seed-Time' : 

' Death is the word of a bovine day, 

Know you the breast of the springing To-Be?' 

Closely in accord with the modern mood in 
ethics and religion is Mr. Meredith's applica- 
tion of this faith. ' Not in idle trust but in 
active service will that life expend itself which 
interprets aright the reading of Earth. Bur- 
den-bearing becomes a joy ; work is the solution 
of futile questionings about the whence and 
the whither. 

' Our questions are a mortal brood. 

Our work is everlasting.' 
' For love we Earth, then serve we all ; 

Her mystic secret then is ours.' 

Mr. Meredith lays less emphasis on the pure 
physical enjoyment of nature than does Whit- 
man ; he treats his theme with more compulsive 
and less intellectual force than Browning. The 
student of his poems, by the reverential read- 
ing of Earth, is able to find the true reading 
of Life; he may subscribe to a creed which in- 
culcates vigor of body, truth of heart, harmony 
and serenity of soul.

Autobiography of ax English 
Reformer.* 



Few subjects that interested the English pol- 
itical and social reformers of the last half-cen- 
tury failed to rouse George Jacob Holyoake to 
action. Mr. Holyoake was a bom fighter. The 
cause of political freedom received most of his 
devotion, but he seems always to have had 
energy enough left to shout for or against any 
public question of importance. His life, de- 
tailed in ' Sixty Years of an Agitator's Life,* 
and continued in two volumes of ' Bygones 
Worth Remembering,' is full of matters of vital 
force and interest. From the early days, when 
he gained fame and lost everything else as a 
leader of the Chartist rebellion in 1848, Mr. 
Holyoake has shown an individuality so strong- 
ly marked and so attractive that he has been the 
chosen companion of statesmen and scientists. 
Gladstone, Herbert Spencer, George Eliot and 
George Henry Lewes, Mazzini and Harriet Mar- 
tineau, sought his society and his advice, and 
listened with pleasure and interest to his vari- 
ous schemes for reforming the governments of 
the universe and propagating ' freedom of opin- 
ion and industrial justice.' With a vanity al- 
most childish in its frankness, Mr. Holyoake 
quotes Herbert Spencer's estimate of him. 
' Not dwelling upon his intellectual capacity, 
which is high, I would emphasize my apprecia- 
tion of his courage, sincerity, truthfulness, 
philanthropy, and unwearied perseverance. 
Such a combination of these qualities, it will, I 
think, be difficult to find.' This frank egotism 
is evidenced on every page of ' Bygones Worth 
Remembering.' There is hardly a paragraph in 
which ^ I ' is not the leading pronoun. While 
this gives a raciness and a personal charm to- 
the book, it involves also a loss of perspective, 
due to Mr. Holyoake's persistent placing of 
himself in the foreground. A dozen stories at 
least in which Mr. Holyoake figures as chief 
actor are repeated almost verbatim in several 
chapters. 

Mr. Holyoake was a man of strong prejudices. 
In fact, even now that he has almost reached 
his ninetieth year, his prejudices remain as 
strong as ever, and sometimes as unreasoning. 
Of Cobden, Gladstone, Harriet Martineau, he 
writes lovingly, with a distinct and ndive 
charm. His estimate of Disraeli, on the other 
hand, need only be compared with Mr. Bryce's 
recent portrait of that picturesque English

statesman, to make it* defects apparent. Dis- 
raeli was certainly not above suspicion. He 
was unboundedly ambitious, selfish, inconsist- 
ent, too glittering to be solid, too clever to be 
wholly true. But still he was a statesman; he 
did not rise to power on phrases, and whatever 
the greatest may think of him he was and is a 
popular favorite, as is indicated by the fact that 
his birt;hday is more largely celebrated than any 
holiday of the kind in England. On that day, 
his statue in London is fairiy buried in flowers, 
and the square is thronged all day with those 
who come to do homage to his memory. Evi- 
dently, Mr, Holyoake is judging by what he 
thinks should be true rather than by what is 
true, when he writes : 

'Disraeli is a fossilized bygone to this genera- 
tion; though in the political arena he was the most 
glittering performer of his day. The moral of this 
singular career, worth remembering, is that genius 
and versatility, animated by ambition without 
scruple, may attain distinction without principle. 
It can win national admiration, but not public affec- 
tion. All it can accomplish is to leave behind a 
name of sinister renown.' 

The most interesting and the most valuable 
chapter in 'Bygones WoriJi Eemembering' is 
devoted to a recounting of what actually hap- 
pened on the famous 10th of April, 1848. Our 
histories tell us of a great Chartist rebellion 
quelled that day through the energy, foresight, 
and special constables of the Duke of Welling- 
ton. The day is remembered as one of the 
crises of modem history, one of the picturesque 
failures' to rerive ancient bloodshed and rebel- 
lion in the name of political reform. Mr. Holy- 
oake has a very different story to tell, with 
facts enough substantiating his version to raise 
an interesting question of validity. 

'Dean Stubbs, in his interesting book on Charles 
Kingsley, says: "On the 10th of April, 1848, a 
revolution was threatened in England. One hun- 
dred thousand armed men were to meet on Ken- 
sington Common and thence to march to Westmin- 
ster, and there to compel, by physical force if 
necessary, the acceptance of the People's Charter 
by the Houses of Parliament." Could any such a 
lunatical statement be written by anyone, and his 
friends not procure a magistrate's order for his 
removal to the nearest asylum! How were the 
"hundred thousand" to get the arms into London 
— if they had them? Whence were they to pro- 
cure them? Where could they store them, seeing 
that at that time there was not a single Chartist meet- 
ing-house that was not known to be in debt, unless 
its rent was paid by the charity of some well-to-do 
sympathizer? What were muskets or pikes to do 
against the stone walls of the Houses of Parliament 
or the Bank? How were cannon to be drawn from 
the centre of London to Kensington Common with 
ample service of powder and shot? Marvellous is 
the history which modern Churchmen write! 

'Politically speaking, London has seen no tamer 
day than the 10th of April, 1848. There was less 
ground for alarm than when a Lord Mayor's pro- 
cession passes through the city. The procession of 



actual Chartists, able to leave their work to join 
it, could never have amounted to four thousand. 
There was not a single weapon among them, nor 
any intention of using it had they possessed it. 
There was absolutely nothing in the field against 
the Duke of Wellington in London but a waggon 
on which a monster petition was piled; yet a mil- 
lion special constables were out, staff in hand. I 
was out with the Chartists that day, and well know 
how different were the facts from what is believed 
to be the peril of the metropolis on that day. Never 
did the craziest despotic government in Europe 
engage in such a political imposture. It was pitia- 
ble that the Duke of Wellington should have had 
no more self-respect than to compromise his great 
career by fortifying London against an imaginary 
enemy. The Government had plentiful information, 
and must have known the truth.' 

Mr. Holyoake has a strong sense of humor, 
but his manner of writing is such that it is not 
always easy to discover when he is jesting and 
when he is in earnest. Most of the chapter on 
American manners and customs may be classed 
as humorous, especially that part which deals 
with Protection, and touches the vital defects 
of the system with a sure finger. Here, as often 
elsewhere, Mr. Holyoake's judgment tells him 
clearly what is right and what is wrong. But 
in spite of his boast of impartiality, his own 
wav to right the wrong is to him the only way. 
He has fallen just a little behind the times in 
preferring political to social freedom. 

It is difficult to pronounce upon the value of 
Mr. Holyoake's autobiography. Certainly, not 
many people will read the two rambling vol- 
umes, where so much is waste material. But 
for the sake of what is of intrinsic value, it is 
to be hoped that somebody will use * Bygones 
Worth Eemembering,' together with his ' Sixty 
Years of an Agitator's Life,' as the basis of 
what might be made one of the broadest and 
most largely representative biographies of our 
times. Edith J. E. Isaacs.

Middle Age. For Florence and her glamour, the

tongue, students have, in the last ten years 
especially, been turning to the more unchanged 
splendor and unbroken tradition of Florence's 
rival and hated enemy, Siena, that wonderful 
hill-town which is still alive, Mr. Hewlett 
writes, when, ' crying ' his ' palinode,' he now 
regretfully pronounces Florence dead. 

And yet the English books on Siena are still 
few in number. As material for short sketches, 
impressions, and the like, Siena has in truth 
been used a goodly number of times. Mr. Hew- 
lett, in *The Eoad in Tuscany,' gives a fair part 
of one volume to his highly individual impres- 
sion of the town and her splendid futile people. 
A few years ago there appeared an excellent 
history of Siena by Mr. Langton Douglas, the 
first one in English at all comprehensive. But 
the most interesting and illuminating as well as 
learned works are those, a whole series now, by 
Mr. William Heywood, beginning six years ago 
with an account both critical and popular of 
that strange survival, the Palio of Siena, — 
' half battle, half horse-race,' — and ending with 
the book entitled ' Palio and Ponte,' in which 
this same subject is treated with infinitely 
greater completeness, allied as the special Sien- 
ese horse-races were with races of many other 
varieties and with other mediasval games 
throughout the Communes of Central Italy. In 
this book the field of Mr. Heywood's research 
is peculiarly his own; and, however essential 
may be a knowledge of the morals of the men 
of those days and their attitude toward the 
ghostly,— r matters more particularly dealt with 
by Mr. Heywood in his ' Ensamples ' of Fra 
Filippo, — yet in the popular games one 
finds perhaps a more wholly unartificial, a more 
utterly pure expression of the popular taste, 
brutal, brave, vivid, and wonderful in spirit, in 
a brutal, brave, and wonderful age. Though the 
general purpose is to give 'an account of the 
sports of Central Italy from the age of Dante 
to the XXth century,' races have the first place, 
in especial the famous Sienese horse-races whose 
inspiration was drawn from the old battle-games 
and whose history shows a strange latter-day 
survival; but also other kinds of races, — races 
of buifaloes, of donkeys, of boats, and of char- 
iots, foot-races of men and of women, — races 
with strange uses, as divertisements, as religious 
observances, and as deadly insults. 

In the first division of the book is traced the 
curious religious character of many of these 
races, and especially of that one, noteworthy 
amongst Sienese races, run in August in honor 
of the Virgin — the Virgin to whom the Sienese 
looked as their suzerain, and to whom in feudal 
allegiance they five times dedicated their city. 
The next division is devoted to other mediaeval 
games, 'the games of popular chivalry,' be- 



ginning with the great game of ' Ponte ' at 
Pisa that was a mimic battle on a bridge — and 
a veritable one too; a game so important and 
so long continued as to merit its share in the 
whole book's title. The second form of joyful 
battle is the ' Battle of Stones ' at Perugia, 
where the air above the central ' scrimmage ' 
was 'blackened by the showers of flying 
stones ' ; the third, the old Italian game resem- 
bling Rugby foot-ball, as it was played at Flor- 
ence. Lastly are described the various kinds of 
ferocious battle-games most popular in Siena, 
such as the ' Elmora ' and the ' Pugna.' 

In the third and last section of the book 
appears the increasing control of the city's pas- 
times by the ' Contrade ' or wards, divisions of 
uncertain origin that, with the fierce partisan- 
ships and bitter jealousies they still foster, give 
to the present ' Palio ' its turbulent mediasval 
character. They promoted various sports, both 
grotesque and decorative, such as donkey races 
that were really fist-fights waged over the body 
of the unfortunate animal, and the elaborate 
pageant of the bull-fight, the joust, and the 
theatrical hunt in the Campo to the music of 
trumpets and bugles and drums. Directly de- 
scended from these more secular amusements, 
yet retaining the religious character of the 
whole sequence of races connected vdih. great 
religious festivals, the modem ' Palio ' alone of 
aill these remains alive. And so the last chap- 
ter is given to a vivid and vigorous description 
of this race that one may see twice every sum- 
mer even now run madly in a circle in the very 
heart of the city, run by the jockeys with great- 
er regard to the cudgelling of their enemies and 
their enemies' horses than to the speed of their 
own, this 'Palio' that 'is, in its origin, a 
blending of the Pugna, the tournament and. 
the horse-race, embellished and glorified by all 
the pomp and pageantry of the Trionfo and of 
the masquerade.' 

The combination in Mr. Heywood of a thor- 
ough scholar 'and an all-around sportsman 
would seem an ideal qualification for writing 
of mediaeval athletics, and a row of cups high 
above the books in his study at Siena, his adopt- 
ed home now for a number of years, tells of 
prowess when he played foot-ball for his county 
and rowed for his college at Cambridge. Later 
he edited a newspaper in our own West, and, 
having become an American citizen, played with 
politics, scanting in nothing the varied life 
there; then turned to Italy and the scholar's 
life. But broad human interest and a sense of 
humor, — so often lacking in those who have 
cultivated scholarship, and scholarship alone, — 
are also surely no mean assets for this work. 

The style throughout is clear and simple, — 
in general not of marked quality, but occasion-

ally showing such vigor and even beaut}- that 
one is tempted to wish for more such pages 
even at the sacrifice of some of the by-paths of 
erudition. Accuracy would also, one feels, not 
suffer by a more sparing use of Latin and 
Italian phrases in the body of the text, — not to 
say over-familiar English quotations, though 
these are less indulged in than they were in 
some of his earlier books. But one prolonged 
sentence, the invocation to Pisa at the begin- 
ning of the chapter on her game of ' Ponte,' 
seems positively inspired to illustrate the pre- 
ceding criticism, combining, as it does, in a 
single sentence, though not without a certain 
rhythm and dash, two Italian quotations, one 
Latin, and a hackneyed English one! The 
pages are weight}' with foot-notes, — but rightly 
so, it would seem. The reader for general 
interest and pleasantness can placidly ignore 
them, and the serious student of things mediae- 
val can verify the accuracy of Mr. Heywood's 
scholarship, and, from the countless authorities 
referred to and quoted, gain many suggestions 
for burrowing of his own. The book is pleasant 
to handle, and those illustrations that are taken 
from old pictures and prints and engravings 
are interesting in themselves and aid greatly in 
understanding forgotten games. In fine, we 
would recommend to the reader by way of sam- 
ple the ghost story of the Blessed Ambrogio 
Sansedoni, to whom a race was dedicated, that 
he may see, perhaps at the best, Mr. Heywood's 
humor and skilful touch in the ghostliness of 
the adventures, comic at bottom, of the worthy 
and over-decorous monk. For st}le, one ex- 
ample may be quoted from the same chapter, 
which deals with a time when Siena, then 
almost steadily excommunicated, ' was literally 
full of devils.' 

'In those days the veil between the seen and 
the unseen was, at the best, exceeding thin. The 
gambler who cursed his luck might, at any moment, 
feel upon his shoulder the grip of demon claws. 
. . . the merchant, who had taken interest on his 
money and who was therefore branded by the 
Church as a usurer, must expect his last hours to 
be vexed by fiends, who, if he took over-long in 
dying, might become impatient and strangle him. 
Sometimes the neighbors of such a man would hear, 
above the howling of the wind and the beating of 
the rain, a trampling of horsemen in the narrow 
streets, and, when they peeped shudderingly through 
the cracks of their closely shuttered windows, 
would see a hellish company, "terrible beyond all 
human imagining," awaiting the end. Lastly, the 
feeble, naked, wailing ghost would be hurried 
through the black portals into the black night; the 
spectre throng would close upon it; shrieks, as of 
a creature in torture, would ring shrilly through 
the darkness, and then grow faint and fainter in 
tie distance, as the demons swept it away to hell, 
"biting and smiting and rending and tearing it".'

IX WOOI>S A2fD GAKDEX.* 



It is with a feeling of surprise as well as 
delight that one sees on the title-page of a new 
book the name of William Hamilton Gibson. 
The delight is scarcely lessened when one dis- 
covers, as in the case of the book on ' Our Native 
Orchids,' that not the letter-press, but only the 
drawings, are the work of Mr. Gibson; for the 
drawings are numerous, and the spirit of Gibson 
informs them all. The writer of the text, Mrs. 
Helena Leeming Jelliffe, is a true disciple of 
that school of real nature-study that means a 
long, patient, and intimate investigation of 
nature's processes under all varieties of circum- 
stances. The text has, in the author's words, 
' been plainly set forth in simple English from 
Mr. Gibson's notes, from the undescriptive sta- 
tistic-s of manuals of botany, and from an inti- 
mate acquaintance with the wild orchids them- 
selves.' 

Mr. Gibson had published an article called 
' A Few Native Orchids ' shortly before his 
death; but besides this, he had completed a 
series of minute drawings of orchids — the per- 
fect flowers, the separate and peculiar parts, and 
all views that might help to make plain those 
strange processes of cross-fertilization that 
Darwin first discovered to an amazed and un- 
believing world. These drawings, as stated 
above, aided by Gibson's notes and supplemented 
by her own observations, Mrs. Jelliffe has elab- 
orated into the book that Gibson had hoped to 
write himself. An intensely interesting book 
it is to all who are students of nature, or who, 
lacking opportunities for that, are still fond 
of reading the results of others' excursions into 
that fascinating field. There is an introduction 
setting forth certain general facts about orchids, 
historical and descriptive, giving a brief account 
of the successive discoveries that culminated in 
Darwin's epoch-making statement that ' no 
higher plant could fertilise itself for a perpe- 
tuity of generations without a cross with some 
other individual.' Then follows an * Illustrated 
Key to the Genera of Orchids,' seventeen in 
number ; and finally the descriptive text. Here 
the habitat of each genus is given, with any 
curious facts about its nomenclature, its dis- 
tinctive features of appearance or construction,

and its wa3's with its insect visitors. Mrs. Jel- 
Jiffe has wisely brought to her assistance any 
words by other writers that will make her 
points plainer; but she has not relied in vain 
upon her own observations, and the result of 
her patient toil, added to the tireless industry 
of that master-observer Gibson, has brought to 
American naturalists a volume, unassuming 
though it is, of substantial value and interest. 

It is a long step from wild orchids to culti- 
vated roses, but it is safe to say that there will 
be a wider, though perhaps not a choicer, circle 
of readers for ' Roses and How to Grow Them/ 
a compilation that forms the first volume of a 
new ' Garden Library,' than for the book we 
have just been describing. The little volume 
on roses is made up of various articles con- 
tributed to ' Country Life in America ' and 
'The Garden Magazine,' revised and supple- 
mented by such material as will make the book 
sufficient for the average amateur, whether his 
ambitions are for a rose-garden, a vine-covered 
house or pergola, or for roses forced under glass. 
The chapters cover such practical subjects as 
the best location for the rose-bed, the time and 
method of planting, the general routine of 
work, including a 'rosarian's calendar,' and 
priming and spraying. There are special chap- 
ters devoted to ' Roses for Cut Flowers under 
Glass,' ' Types and Races,' ' Roses for Special 
Purposes,' and ' Roses of American Origin.' 
The first of these chapters is long and com- 
paratively detailed, showing that outdoor and 
indoor culture have many important differences 
as well as similarity of principles. The next 
two chapters will generally be consulted only 
when one is purchasing plants; but it is rather 
amusing to see how far the classification has 
gone when one list is labeled * Roses for Bou- 
tonnieres.' The lists include special roses for 
different soils, for different uses, for different 
positions in the garden, and for certain typical 
localities. The last chapter, *^ Roses of Amer- 
ican Origin,' will be of interest mainly to rose 
fanciers, its object being chiefly ' to demonstrate 
what has really been achieved by the American 
Rose growers.' The book is freely and attract- 
ively illustrated, most of the inscriptions being 
amply descriptive of the purpose of the pictures. 

' The Book of Garden Design ' is an English 
publication, but so infused with common-sense 
that its principles, if not all its specific details, 
might be studied with advantage by many Amer- 
ican garden owners and designers. The author 
describes somewhat at length the different 
schools of garden design, recommending neither 
the formal nor the landscape style exclusively, 
but rather a judicious adaptability that shall 
result from a close study of all the circum- 
stances, — the situation, the size of the grounds, 



the style and size of the house, and the general 
purposes of the owner. It is important that 
the garden designer should be also a practical 
gardener, familiar with the growth and habits 
of the trees, shrubs, and plants he wishes to 
use, in order that his work may not be undone 
in the future. Mr. Thonger decries the use of 
the expression ' garden architect,' suggesting 
that the terms are contradictory, and apt to 
give a wrong spirit to the work of the designer. 
He also deprecates the application of too for- 
mal and pretentious garden designs to the ordi- 
nary ' villa,' country or suburban, which this 
very expression, ' garden architect,' is apt to 
foster. N'ow all this is sturdy common-sense, 
and just as applicable to America as to Eng- 
land. However, the book is not chiefly contro- 
versial. It advocates first a general spirit of 
simplicity, avoiding both complexity and eccen- 
tricity. It then proceeds with suggestions for 
selecting or adapting a site, and for laying out 
drives and paths, which the author thinks should 
not be too many or winding. The kitchen- 
garden and orchard come within this scheme, 
and these may be made beautiful as well as 
necessary adjuncts to the home-grounds. The 
author considers the value of water, running or 
otherwise, in the garden scheme, and gives use- 
ful advice as to planting on its margin. The 
last four chapters are devoted to perennials, 
aquatic plants, trees, shrubs^ and hardy climb- 
ers, and include some suggestive lists for prac- 
tical gardeners. Altogether, the little book is 
quite likely to be useful to those who take their 
gardening in earnest. Edith GRAJfGER. 



Economic Facts and Fancies.* 



Political economy is no longer a dismal 
science. Its devotees have ceased to picture 
the future of humanity as a thoroughly dis- 
couraging prospect of geometrically increasing 
population and consequently decreasing stand- 
ard of living, with poverty and starvation as 
the inevitable condition of mankind. Despair 
has given place to hope, and students of- eco- 
nomic science are now to be found among the 
most ardent supporters of sundry schema for 
social betterment. Moreover, the true science 
of man never can be ' dull and uninteresting.' 
On the contrary, it is always full of unexpected

turns and curious surprises. The fact that the 
frivolous fancy for ornament should have laid 
the foundation on which the genius of the 
race has reared tlie great structures of money, 
commerce, and credit, has many parallels. As 
Emerson remarked, ' the magnet was used as a 
toy long before it was used in navigation.' 

Economics seems to stand in far greater dan- 
ger of not being able to justify its title of sci- 
ence at all. In the first place, there is abso- 
lutely no agreement as to the use of such terms 
as money, rent, capital, and so forth. The 
Eicardiau theory of rent, having joined hands 
with Jevons's theory of value, has become the 
fountain-head of an endless stream of technical 
terminolog}-, so that not infrequently the study 
of the subject is really being carried on in a 
new language for which special glossaries will 
soon be necessary. Palgrave's ' Dictionary of 
Political Ec-onomy ' bristles with the new 
phraseolog}- on every second page. The whole 
system of modern economies rests on what Mr. 
Carlile. the author of ' Economic Methods and 
Economic Fallacies,' believes to be a false basis, 
— namely, a confusion between the principles 
that are applicable in physics, and those ob- 
jective sciences wherein appeal to the outward 
fact is possible and profitable, and the prin- 
ciples and methods applicable to those sciences, 
of which economics is the most conspicuous, 
in which one moiety of the questions discussed 
may be said to belong to the sphere of matter, 
while another moiety belongs to the sphere of 
mind and of subjective investigation. Between 
these two is a great gulf fixed; and it is be- 
cause the mathematical economists have under- 
estimated this distinction that another great 
gulf has become fixed between the theoretical 
economics of the University and the practical 
economics of the newspaper and the Stock Ex- 
change. The reason for the chasm, as well as 
the way to bridge it, Mr. Carlile finds in the 
false conception of money as an entirely negli- 
gible intermediary in economic relations (p. 
180). Here is *' the true view that was like 
enough to the false one to be mistaken for it. 
If we conceive of economic life as having come 
to divide itself into two departments, the one 
devoted to the obtaining of money [the italics 
are mine], and the other devoted to the ex- 
pending of it (p. 130), we can at once get rid 
of the palpably false assumption of the 
universal irksomeness of labor. We can also 
very well do without both of those doubt- 
ful postulates of invincible laziness in human 
nature, and of inevitable misery in the world 
that we inhabit.' He justly adds that if the 
homo economicus were the sort of creature that 
such writers as Jevons and Pantaleoni describe 
him as being he would certainlv be the most 



contemptible as well as the most uninteresting 
of all existing animals. In the latter part of 
his book, Mr. Carlile brin^ the general line 
of reasoning to bear on the Fiscal Problem, 
as it is called in England; and although an 
uncompromising free-trader, he finds himself 
obliged to throw overboard a number of the ar- 
guments that have done yeoman service in the 
past, but cannot be expected to tell effectively 
on the mind of the average voter — the * cheap- 
ening ' of commodities to produce mere abund- 
ance, the appeal to 'natural' rights, the ex- 
clusive stress laid on the interest of consumers 
as contrasted with those of the producers, the 
fondness for broad generalizations regarding 
prices in general, and the taking of isolated 
cases and relying on them for the substantia- 
tion of universal propositions. He is particu- 
larly severe on some of the arguments of the 
too ingenious Bastiat, and the laissez faire 
school. 

Mr. Edward Atkinson would do well to read, 
ponder, and follow the advice given by the Eng- 
lish free-trader. Certainly the cause he has at 
heart cannot gain adherents from the camp 
of the enemv bv such argument as the follow- 
ing (p. 128) : ' 

' It would be about as wise to attribute the prog- 
ress and prosperity of this country to a protective 
system, and to attribute the variations in our 
progress which have occurred to the change in 
the tariff, as it would be to count the number of 
red-haired children bom at given periods, endowed 
with a sanguine and aggressive temperament, and 
then to attribute to their influence when reaching 
adult age the variations which have occurred in our 
progressive conditions. ' 

It ma}- also be doubted whether the science of 
economics will be greatly advanced by papers 
which the author admits were sent to press 
without such complete revision and condensa- 
tion as would have been suitable. Mr. Atkin- 
son believes that ' Pacts and Figures ' are the 
basis of economic science; but the fact that 
the large majority of men in business fancy 
they are protected in some mysterious way is 
the all-important fact with which the legislator 
and the tariff reformer has to deal. To such 
men the figures presented do not appeal. The 
theory, of protection may have become intel- 
lectually dead, as Mr. Atkinson fondly reit- 
erates ; but the * misleading imagination ' re- 
mains, and to it our arguments must be ad- 
dressed. ' 

If ' taxes on crude wool, ores, luml^er, dye- 
stuffs and chemicals . . . tend to protect 
the foreign manufactures,' cannot the manu- 
facturers thus handicapped be organized into an 
effective Eeform Club ? If ' taxes on food and 
fuel, on fish, vegetables, provisions and coal 
increase the c-ost of living, and oppress those

who earn the least wages more than any other 
class, while they are of advantage to no one, — 
mere obstructions to progress,' cannot the facts 
be presented to labor leaders rather than to the 
American Social Science Association, so that 
an organized effort may be made to modify the 
tariff in the interest of wage-earners rather than 
to revise it in the interest of some particular 
group of manufacturers? It seems to be the 
prime fault of certain philosophers in every 
field, 'from chemistry to crime,' that they are 
prone to mistake cause and effect. Evidently 
what is needed in the public discussion of in- 
dustrial problems and policy is clear and concise 
statement of the simple truths and plain facts 
of social life, not vague meandering comment. 
Another and perhaps the chief cause of the 
popular contempt for political economy is the 
fact that most economists seem to forget the 
complex character of all social problems. In 
their public utterances they preach an economic 
doctrine and ignore the political, legal, or 
ethical side of the question. Private property 
in land, public ownership of certain monopolies, 
the different methods of taxing real and per- 
sonal property, trusts and trade-unions, the rela- 
tion of the state to each, questions of currency 
and banking, the tariff, eight-hour law, and 
the most fundamental question of all as to the 
organization of society on a more or less com- 
plete communism, — these are only partially 
economic questions. As such they require in- 
vestigation by methods as scrupulously scientific 
as those of mathematics. But they also require 
an equally scientific study from the legal, the 
ethical, the political, and the social point of 
view. The application of all these laws in the 
particular circumstances is the duty of the legis- 
lator and administrator. It is the art of poli- 
tics. 'The investigation of economic law is a 
strictly scientific inquiry, as much as the in- 
vestigation of the law of gravitation; and the 
determination of economic law falls within the 
competence of the University.' As Professor 
Dunbar points out in his volume of ' Economic 
Essays,' it is of far more consequence that the 
student should learn to reason truly than that 
he should perceive and accept any particular 
truth. His volume, made up largely of con- 
tributions to the "Quarterly Journal of Eco- 
nomics,' exemplifies to the full this vital dis- 
tmction and his high ideal of the duties of the 
University teacher. He separates fact from 
fancy, and presents the results of scientific in- 
quiry, largely in the field of banking and cur- 
rency, in an eminently judicious and scholarly 
manner. It leads one to regret his unwillingness 
to contribute more widely to the discussion of 
current questions of economics and politics.

Recent Fictiox.* 



' Love's Cross-Currents ' is a work of recent 
fiction only in the sense that it is now first 
published in a form likely to attract the atten- 
tion of the general reader. It was originally 
called ' A Year's Letters,' was contributed in 
1877 by Mr. Swinburne, writing under the 
pseudonym of ' Mrs. Horace Manners,' to a. 
short-lived London paper called ' The Tatler,' 
and its only appearance in book form (before- 
the present edition) was brought about in one- 
of Mr. Mosher's reprints. The author has now 
been persuaded by his friend Mr. Theodore- 
Watts-Dunton to consent to its republication, 
which fact is made the pretext for a special 
note of dedication. Since the story is told in 
epistolary form, this note is a brief defence of 
' that apparent compromise between a story and 
a play,' with citation of Richardson and Scott 
as exemplars. 'But,' the author adds, 'these- 
are perhaps too high and serious matters to be 
touched upon in a note of acknowledgment pre- 
fixed to so early an attempt in the great art 
of fiction or creation that it would never have 
revisited the light or rather the twilight of 
publicity under honest and legitimate auspices, 
if it had not found in you a sponsor and a 
friend.' This book must be read with two facts^ 
constantly in view. One is that the poet wrote

older) it had not, forty years ago, been 
worked to death by the noveliste as it now seems 
to our jaded senses to have been. Keeping these 
facts in mind, the story may be read to-day with 
profit and interest. Its note is that of satirical 
comedy, and is struck by no light touch, but 
the delineations of character are subtle and 
artistic, especially in the case of the garrulous 
and malicious old woman whose letters are the 
longest and the most entertaining. The other 
letters are by younger people, mostly in love 
with other people's wives, and bravely getting 
over it. As one of them remarks : * Our little 
bit of comedy slips off the stage without noise, 
and the curtain laps down over it. Lucky it 
never turned to the tearful style, as it once 
threatened to do.' If we may so pervert the 
metaphor of the title as to take it electrically, 
we may say that when the wires get crossed in 
our actual habitations, we are apt to have more 
of a conflagration than here results. We are 
not going to hail Mr. Swinburne as a great 
novelist on the strength of this performance, 
but may fairly call it a clever, almost brilliant, 
piece of work in a difficult form. After we 
have once mastered the intricate relationships 
of the persons concerned (no easy matter) and 
learned to recognize them by their names with- 
out climbing the genealogical tree over again, 
we may follow the development of the story 
with no slight interest. 

Mr. Maurice Hewlett gives to his new 
romance the happy title of ' The Fool Errant,' 
and he works out the conception with much 
ingenuity. The story is the autobiography of 
one Francis-Antony Strelley, an English Cath- 
olic, sent to Padua in the early eighteenth cen- 
tury for the completion of his education, and 
thus launched upon what proves to be a most 
extraordinary career of mingled chance and mis- 
chance. Two women serve chiefly for the shap- 
ing of his destinies. Aurelia is the youthfid 
wife of the learned and corpulent professor of 
the civil law to whose care the hero is consigned, 
and of whose household he becomes a member. 
Thereupon the youth falls in love with his 
hostess, albeit his love-making is of the most 
innocent sort, and much trouble ensues. In 
danger of surprise one evening when engaged 
in the delightful occupation of kissing Aurelia's 
hands, he is hastily thrust into a cupboard. 
When the enraged husband discovers the pres- 
ence of the youthful swain, he chucks both him 
and his divinity into the street. When the re- 
morseful youth recovers his senses, Aurelia has 
vanished, and he starts on a pilgrimage to seek 
her out and implore her forgiveness. She is in 
reality as little the ideal which he makes of her 
as the actual Dulcinea del Toboso was far re- 
moved from the ideal of the sorrowful knight 



of La Mancha, but it is long before he makes 
the discovery, and he has meanwhile a most sur- 
prising series of adventures. Divesting him- 
self of fine raiment and the means of support, 
he tramps from place to place in his search, 
consorting with rustics and ruflfians, strolling 
players and other picturesque vagabonds, he 
suffers all kinds of indignities, not the least of 
which is the incredulity with which everyone 
receives the confession of his pure intentions 
concerning the fair Aurelia. His conduct is 
indeed that of a fool as seen in the light of 
the easy-going morality and the gracious villainy 
of that land and period. During his wander- 
ings he falls in with Virginia, a beautiful con- 
tadina whom he saves from a life of shame, and 
who worships him ever thereafter with a dog- 
like devotion. Later on, when the unworthiness 
of Aurelia is made apparent to him, shattering 
the image which has hitherto been enshrined in 
his thoughts, he is wedded to Virginia, and the 
story ends with a long vista of future happiness 
beneath the Italian sky, for the hero never re- 
turns to his native land. The narrative is of the 
kind conventionally described as picaresque, and 
as such, we may abandon ourselves to its charm 
without an afterthought. But we cannot escape 
realizing also — being of the modem age, and 
consequently critical and sophisticated — that 
the author has given us an extraordinarily inti- 
mate and sympathetic depiction of the life of 
the post-renaissance age in Italy, with its pic- 
toresqueness. its corruption, and its astonishing 
contrasts. We feel that he is simply saturated 
with the life of the time and the color of the 
environment, and that he has reproduced these 
things with marvellous fidelity. This is the chief 
title of the book to praise, and a high title it is. 
Father Sheehan is by way of becoming a full- 
fledged novelist. As the author of ' My Xew 
Curate* and *Luke Dehnege' he has won his 
way to many hearts by virtue of his genial 
portrayal of Irish life and character, and the 
very human quality of his writing made us 
tolerant of the large admixture of theological 
discussion with which those books were bur- 
dened. In * Glenanaar,' his latest novel, his 
theological ballast is thrown overboard, and he 
gives us a plain storj' of deep interest. It is a 
story that begins some seventy-five years ago, 
with the farcical trial of a batch of Irish con- 
spirators, and the dramatic intervention of 
O'Connell just in time to save them from an 
unjust conviction. Out of this episode is spun 
the thread of the narrative, which runs down 
into our own time, and is chiefly concerned 
with the descendants of an informer — that 
most despised of mortals — whose perjured tes- 
timony had nearly done a number of his fellow- 
countrymen to death. It is a book deep-rooted 



114 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



in its racial element, interpreting Irish char- 
acter with an eye by no means blind to its 
faults, but always with penetration and tender 
sympathy. The tale is somewhat disconnected 
in sequence, but is sweet and wholesome, and, 
withal, not lacking in touches of humor. Its 
atmosphere is Catholic, as a matter of course, 
but not, as we have already stated, in any dog- 
matic or controversial sense. 

'The Apple of Eden,' by Mr. E. Temple 
Thurston, is another book with a Catholic at- 
mosphere, but it is burdened with a problem, 
and its note is of revolt rather than acceptance. 
It offers a powerful and unpleasantly-stated ar- 
gument against the institution of celibacy, and 
shows us, in the life of a priest, how nature 
will have its way in spite of vows and renuncia- 
tions. It opens with a scene in the confessional, 
and develops, through the untoward workings of 
fate, into a tale of passion, in which the priestly 
hero all but succumbs to the very temptation 
confessed by his penitent in the opening chap- 
ter. It is a story of considerable power, but 
its frankness exceeds the bounds of what is ar- 
tistically permissible. 

When our future historian, in some age con- 
trolled by a more rational conception of suc- 
cess than now obtains, shall look back to our 
present epoch of frenzied materialism, seeking 
to explore its psychology, the novelists will be 
found to have provided him with some of the 
most important of his documents. They have 
themselves not infrequently given a false color- 
ing to their facts, and been far from definite 
in their sense of ethical values, but they have 
been zealous to reflect the unlovely phases of 
our life, and, although sometimes overawed by 
the gigantic forces they have found at play in 
our commercial civilization, have at least been 
searching in their analysis, and vivid in their 
portrayal. In the qualities of truth and vitality, 
such a book as Mr. Herrick's ' Memoirs of an 
American Citizen' takes high rank. Nor can 
such a book fail even of a sort of passionate 
interest to us. who see illustrated every day, in 
lives that are near and possibly dear to us, the 
conditions which it depicts, and the motives 
which it represents as prevailing. This sort of 
interest in such a book, we trust, will eventually 
disappear, but the social-historical value will re- 
main for the instruction of our posterity. Read 
to-day, it is not particularly instructive, for we 
know too well all that it tells us, but it may 
prove helpful for admonition and example. Yet 
even in this capacity, the story does not seem 
to realize its full possibilities. We are no advo- 
cates of an obtrusive morality in fiction, but it 
seems to us that Mr. Herrick is something too 
much of the dispassionate observer, that he re- 



presses too much the note of indignation, that 
his attitude suggests too much of acceptance, 
too little of protest and repudiation. The im- 
plicit moral is evident enough, and a stern one 
it is, but selfishness and corruption are given 
too complete a triumph, honesty and altruism 
are too thoroughly worsted in the struggle, to 
satisfy the dem'ands we may rightfully make 
of a work of art. In this book, the unscrupu- 
lous central character achieves every kind of 
material success, and the characters that in any 
way stand for decency are presented to us in a 
light that makes them appear weak and ridicu- 
lous. Professions of principle are met with a 
covert sneer, and efforts to act in accordance 
with any motive higher than selfishness are made 
to appear contemptible. This they doubtless are 
in the eyes of the 'American citizen' whose 
dubious rise to wealth and political honor is 
here outlined, but the author need not view 
them — nay, is bound not to view them — from 
that angle of observation. Such must be our 
fundamental criticism of this autobiography of 
the country boy who becomes a pork-packer in 
Chicago, rises to fortune by corrupt practices, 
and purchases a seat in the Senate as the crown 
of his life of dishonor. The author persuades 
us to follow the career of this arch-criminal witii 
a certain degree of s}Tnpathy, and does little 
or nothing to encourage our sympathy with 
those of his characters who shrink from mak- 
ing terms with the mammon of unrighteousness. 
The story seems to be rooted in bitter cynicism 
and to embody the very philosophy of despair. 

'The Accomplice,' by Mr. FTederick T'revor 
Hill, is the story of a mysterious crime, but 
offers a variant upon the usual form of the 
detective yam, in that the account of the trial 
occupies the whole book. Through an imex- 
pected turn in the proceedings, the villain is 
revealed in the person of the counsel for the 
defense, and the young woman on trial is trium- 
phantly acquitted. This book is above the av- 
erage of its class, and will provide an hour of 
entertainment for the most jaded of readers. 

The novel of American politics has become 
a conspicuous feature of our current literature, 
and no season now passes without making sev- 
eral additions to this category. ' John Van 
Buren, Politician,' is an anonymous publication 
which gives us a close view of governmental 
matters in New York City and State. Who- 
ever the writer may be, he knows intimately 
the workings of Tammany and of the corrupt 
ring that controls legislative affairs at Albany. 
He draws for us a full-length portrait of Rich- 
ard Croker, and many of his secondary figures 
will doubtless be recognized by readers who are 
cognizant of the local sitiiation. The book has

no style, and but slight interest considered as 
a story. Its implied ethics, moreover, are of a 
highly dubious character. 

A much better book, one that has style (of a 
sort) , an interesting framework, and characteri- 
zations of no mean order of merit, is ^The 
Ultimate Passion,' by Mr. Philip Verrill 
Mighels. Here the specific scene is N'ew York 
City, but the arena of the conflict depicted is 
national, for the hero is a presidential candidate. 
How he places himself in the hands of the cor- 
ruptionists who dictate nominations and con- 
trol policies, making all the time the mental 
reservation that he will kick over the traces 
when once occupying the seat of power, how he 
lends himself to their nefarious schemes and 
acquiesces in their infamous methods, how he 
even pledges himself to marry the daughter of 
the arch-conspirator, — these are the matters 
with which the plot is mainly concerned. Mean- 
while, he secretly marries the woman of his 
choice, and the revelation of this fact, at almost 
the last moment, brings about the collapse of 
the whole structure of political machination 
which he and his associates have spent many 
toilsome months in rearing. This is a very 
vigorous book, inspired by genuine passion, and 
making a skilful progress to its logical conclu- 
sion. And we have no doubt that it offers an 
essentially truthful presentation of the way in 
which our national destinies are manipulated 
by the great moneyed interests. If such illum- 
inating expositions should be sufficiently multi- 
plied, we may hope that they will eventually 
have the effect of arousing the dormant indig- 
nation of an outraged people. 

' Miss Bellard's Inspiration,' the latest of the 
many books that Mr. Howells has given us, has 
a charm altogether out of proportion to its pre- 
tensions. It is no more than a novelette in 
dimensions, and its story is of the simplest, but 
displays in the telling a very delicate art. There 
are six people concerned — Miss Bellard and 
her fiance, the aunt and uncle with whom they 
spend a few days in the country, and a married 
couple who are their guests by chance. This 
couple proves to be singularly mismated, and 
the spectacle afforded by their bickerings so 
alarms the heroine that she discards her lover, 
lest some such future may be in store for them 
also. She speaks by way of explanation, about 
' that strange sort . of feeling I had that we 
would be like them, if we married, and that 
there was not room in the world for two such 
quarrelsome couples.' Lateron, when the jangling 
pair have reached the point of imminent di- 
vorce, the rejected lover makes the following plea 
for a resumption of the old relations : ' If they 
are separated for good and all, don't you see 



that it gives us our chance ? ' The argument 
is convincing, and these are the words in which 
the heroine describes her capitulation : * The 
point was a very fine one, and I kept losing it; 
but he never did ; and he held me to it, so that 
when he did go away, I promised him that I 
would think about it. I did think about it, 
and before morning I had a perfect inspiration. 
My inspiration was that when I was so helpless 
to reason it out for myself, I ought to leave it 
altogether to him, and that is why we are going 
to be married in the spring.' This is the ortho- 
dox conclusion, if brought about by whimsical 
means, but we cannot escape a certain concern 
for the young man's future. 

' The Unwritten Law,' by Mr. Arthur Henry, 
is a novel born of the generous sympathy that 
inspired ' Les Miserables,' a sympathy that may 
easily degenerate into mere sentimentalism, and 
comes dangerously near to doing so in the pres- 
ent instance. According to philosophers of this 
bent, society is really responsible for the sins 
of the individual, and when they pay the penalty 
which society imposes they are to be regarded 
rather as martyrs than as anything else. Mr. 
Henry sustains this thesis in three leading cases : 
One of them is afforded by a man who loses 
his savings as the result of a bank defalcation 
and turns to counterfeiting as a means of live- 
lihood; the other two are afforded by girls who 
easily allow themselves to be seduced. It is, 
of course, quite possible for a writer to present 
cases like these so artfully as to enlist all our 
sympathies on the side of the offenders, but 
the undertaking is ethically more than ques- 
tionable, and can be defended only by sophistry. 
And there is no kind of excuse for the excessively 
plain speaking in which this book indulges upon 
subjects that every consideration of decency de- 
mands should be veiled. The book is one of 
present-day life in New York, and impresses 
one as the work of a reporter rather than of a 
constructive novelist. 

' A Madcap Cruise ' is well named. A reck- 
less youth, nephew and ward of a millionaire, 
by guile and strategy, gets possession of his 
uncle's yacht, and, accompanied by a fellow- 
conspirator almost equally deep-dyed in vill- 
ainy, crosses the Atlantic to join the girl he 
loves, and from whom the fiat of the aforesaid 
uncle has sought to keep him apart. The moral 
of the story is that love laughs at uncles and 
all such obstructive agencies. It is badly in 
need of a moral of some kind, since the piratical 
proceeding of the youth is hardly to be con- 
doned upon any of the ordinarily-accepted the- 
ories of rectitude, while equally open to question 
is the episode in which his companion, left in 
charge of the yacht in Italian waters, uses it 



116 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



for the felonious purpose of aiding an archae- 
ologist to get away with certain ill-gotten 
treasures from the clutches of Italian law. This 
escapade prospers, no less than the primary act 
of piracy, and the latter is forgiven by the en- 
raged uncle because it accidentally saves him 
from the wreck of his fortunes at the hands of 
an accomplished swindler. 

This story might fairly be called an extrav- 
aganza, and this title is actually applied to the 
next book on our list, alluringly named ' The 
Venus of Cadiz.' Here we have the love-story 
of a Kentucky mushroom-grower and an unso- 
phisticated heiress, with incidental complica- 
tions involving several military gentlemen, a 
lady's companion, a shady countess, a decadent 
novelist, several moonshiners, the boy Pete, and 
the dog Pup. The last-named character is the 
only one who comes completely to grief, being 
despatched with many bloody wounds by the 
decadent novelist. In the case of this book, 
the plot is naught, and the manner everything. 
As one startling development follows another, 
we are left at once breathless with excitement 
and convulsed with mirth. A racy and rollick- 
ing book it is, warranted to dispel the most 
chronic case of blues. 

The novels of Miss Elizabeth Robins do not 
always make pleasant reading, but they always 
have ideas wrought into their texture, and this 
intellectual quality compels for them a respect- 
ful and attentive hearing. In ' A Dark Lan- 
tern ' we have, first of all, a close parallel to the 
situation presented by the ' Dorothea ' of ' Mar- 
ten Maartens.' The innocent heroine has a dis- 
sipated father, and so completely has his char- 
acter been concealed from her during her youth 
that she is slow to realize the full depth of its 
degradation. Tlien, also as in ' Dorothea,' a 
German prince appears as her lover, and is the 
object of a romantic affection. Here the two 
plots diverge, for the lover in this case is an 
unworthy person, who seeks first to betray the 
girl, then, reluctantly, offers her a morganatic 
marriage, which she naturally rejects with 
scorn. About midway in the book the real hero, 
who has made a brief early entrance, comes 
to the centre of the stage, there to remain until 
the final fall of the curtain. He is a physician 
of brusque and bearish manners, as ignorant 
of the amenities of life as he is skilful in his 
profession. His very harshness seems to fas- 
cinate the heroine, who becomes his patient, and 
surprises herself by falling in love with him. 
Her infatuation leads her to desert the world 
of fashion, and bury herself in the village where 
he has his country home, and to which he makes 
a brief visit at the end of the week. All this 
time there is no marriage, for the physician is 
a very canny person, whose contempt for the 



weaker sex is unbounded, and who is determined 
to take no chances. When the heroine has been 
reduced, in his view, to a sufficiently abject 
condition, he magnanimously consents to a legal 
union. All this, as may readily be seen, af- 
fords material of which much may be made by 
as brilliant a writer as Miss Robins, who almost 
(but not quite) forces upon us acceptance of 
the extraordinary relation thus outlined. Her 
characters certainly have vitality, and an ex- 
traordinary power to interest us — even the un- 
prepossessing character of the 'dark lantern,' 
or ' black-magic man,' who so unaccountably 
fascinates the heroine. 

Miss Murfree's latest novel, ' The Storm Cen- 
tre,' is a story of the Civil War, slight in sub- 
stance, and of moderate interest only. Some- 
thing of this writer's earlier magic still attracts 
to her descriptive passages, but invention and 
characterization are far below the level of her 
best previous work. The scene is in Tennessee, 
mostly in the home of a Southern gentleman, 
and the principal characters are the members 
of his household and a Federal officer who ac- 
cepts his hospitality during a prolonged period 
of illness. This officer falls under suspicion of 
having aided the enemy (at least through neg- 
ligence) in a raid which has disastrous results 
for the Federal campaign, and he is court-mar- 
tialled in consequence. He is sentenced to 
death, but a review of the case acquits him, 
and his romance — for a woman is actively con- 
cerned — ends happily. There are some adora- 
ble children in the story, and an amusing study 
of an old negro retainer of the family.

Bryant, and the The new life of Bryant, by Mr. 
hirth of poetry William Aspenwall Bradley, in 
in America. ^^6 'English Men of Letters' 
series (Macmillan), adds nothing of novelty to 
the already published facts of the poet's life; 
but readers will find the volume a convenient, 
clear, and thoroughly readable biography. Mr. 
Bradley has followed strictly the chronological 
method in his story, discussing the productions 
of a period in connection with the activities 
amid which they had their inspiration,— a 
method which is logical and illuminating to all 
concerned. In his estimate. of Bryant's place in 
literature, the author is appreciative and gener- 
ous. To him it seems that criticism, 'especially 
American criticism,' has done the poet scant 
justice. He speaks of Bryant as 'the most im- 
aginative, perhaps, of all our poets save Foe.' 
Yet he is discriminating in his praises and his 
claims. He tells the story of 'Thanatopsis' 
more intelligibly and more completely than some 
earlier biographers. 'To a Waterfowl' he con-

siders the crown of Bryant's verse. Perhaps it 
is worth while to suspend our criticism at this 
jKjint long enough to recall the fact that in 
1821 "William Cullen Brj-ant, twenty-seven years 
of age and not altogether unknown, published 
his first volume, a pamphlet of forty-four pages, 
containing just these eight poems: 'The Ages,' 
'To a Waterfowl,' 'Translation of a Fragment 
of Simonides,' 'Inscription for the Entrance to 
a Wood,' 'The Yellow Violet,' 'Song' (The 
Hunter of the West), 'Green River,' and 'Than- 
atopsis.' As Mr. Bradley states, this unpreten- 
tious volume indeed 'marks the birth of Ameri- 
can poetry just as surely as Irving's "Sketch- 
Book" marks the birth of American prose lit- 
erature.' The comparative unproductivity of the 
poet's later years, his almost complete absorp- 
tion in political and editorial activities after 
1832, with the resultant decline of poetical as- 
piration, leads Mr. Bradley into some interest- 
ing, if futile, conjecture. For instance, in speak- 
ing of Bryant's selection of Xew York as a 
residence in 1825, he suggests that Boston might 
have proved a better field of operations. The 
atmosphere of New York, literary and social, he 
thinks may have been unpropitious for the 
poet's development. 'In Boston or Cambridge 
he would have felt the stir of intellectual life 
about him, and his poetry, perfect in form, 
might have gained in depth and feeling.' With 
reference to the political stand of the poet jour- 
nalist, while not altogether commending Bry- 
ant's attitude toward abolitionism, the biog- 
rapher devotes a paragraph to an interesting 
comparison of Bryant and Whittier, with this 
remark: 'It [abolitionism] was in the main the 
most ideal impulse that has ever been felt in 
American politics. Whittier sacrificed his art 
to become the poet of a movement. Bryant 
kept outside of movements and preserved his art 
intact, yet with a certain loss in wide human 
sjTnpathy. It is significant how little his poetry 
reflects of the excitement of the time in which 
it was written.' The discussion of Bryant as a 
nature-poet is particularly suggestive. His rela- 
tion to Wordsworth and to other so-called poets 
of nature is well stated. Dwellers in the Mid- 
dle West will take especial pleasure in the ac- 
count (here given in more detail than in any 
other life of Bryant) of the poet's visits to 
Jacksonville and Princeton, Illinois, where his 
brothers and finally all the remaining members 
of his family had settled. It was in the pio- 
neer days (the first visit was in 1832) when 
Bryant gazed for the first time upon these 'un- 
shorn fields, boundless and beautiful,' pro- 
foundly impressed by the encircling vastness 
swept with the shadows of the clouds, aflame 
with tossing golden flowers, the haunt of hawk 
and wolf and deer. This was the inspiration of 

'The Prairies.'

Legg,— 'Select Docimients Illus- 
trative of the History of the French Revolu- 
tion, and the Constituent Assembly' (Oxford 
University Press)— it might be inferred that 



this work was another 'source book,' provided 
primarily, as the selections are not translated, 
for the usef of advanced college classes. The 
editor apparently does not have so restricted a 
body of readers in view. His aim is to tell the 
stoiy of the Revolution 'almost in the words 
of the Frenchmen of the time.' For this pur- 
pose he has made his selections chiefly from the 
newspapers, on the supposition that a newspa- 
per's comments are a far better indication of 
the currents of opinion than are memoirs, gen- 
erally written years after the events they de- 
scribe, or even contemporary private letters. 
This is true enough, although many letters at 
once recur to the mind, the statements of which 
are more significant than newspaper comment, 
—for example, Sir Samuel Romilly's letter, writ- 
ten late in July, 1789, describing for a Paris 
friend the first impression made in England by 
the fall of the Bastille. Another illustration is 
the series of letters written by Camille Des- 
moulins to his father, from May to July of the 
same j-ear. Mr. Legg's selections are made 
with excellent judgment, and are all interesting. 
Such journals as the political part of the Mer- 
cure de France, edited by Mallet du Pan, Mira- 
beau's Courrier de Provence, and Brissot's 
Patriate franq<iis are most frequently drawn 
upon. The characterization of Brissot's jour- 
nal as 'open to all the most fantastic absurdi- 
ties that ever entered the brain of a French- 
man unbalanced by the excitement of the ctd- 
bute gSnSrale ' seems too severe, especially for 
the numbers printed in 1789. In his biograph- 
ical note, the editor inserts the rather snobbish 
fling that Brissot was the son of a pastry cook. 
Occasionally the texts of laws vital to the com- 
prehension of the period are inserted in the 
body of the work, while others fill about one 
hundred pages of the appendix. Each group of 
selections is prefaced by an introductory note, 
explaining the circumstances which provoked the 
comments or discussion. The special value of 
this work is that it makes accessible the opin- 
ions of the leading journals? upon the most im- 
portant events of the first two j'ears of the 
Revolution. Hitherto only those within reach 
of the largest libraries could become acquainted 
with this material. It is to be hoped that Mr. 
Legg's enterprise wiU meet with such encour- 
agement that he will publish a similar work for 
the later vears of the Revolution.

Older than Rome itself by perhaps four cen- 
turies, the city of Gubbio reached its most flour- 
ishing condition during the early years of the 
fourteenth century; the population had in- 
creased to fifty thousand; a native school of 
painting was established, noble buildings were 
erected, and even the commtmes of Florence and 
Siena and Perugia did not disdain to seek an 
alliance with Gubbio. To-day the town has 
barely a tenth of this population, but it still 
weai's its mediaeval aspect and continues many

of its old customs and traditions,— especially 
the Festa of the Ceri, a ceremonial as distinc- 
tive and interesting in its Avay as the Palio of 
Siena, celebrated yearly on the 16th of May. 
Hitherto this tOAvn has lacked any popular or 
condensed authority on its history and monu- 
ments. This Avant is now supplied in a truly 
admirable manner by the book 'Gubbio, Past 
and Present' (London: David Nutt), by Miss 
Laura McCracken, illustrated by charming draw- 
ings made by Miss Katharine McCracken, Vis- 
itors at Assisi and Perugia will welcome this 
charming guide to the attractions of the less 
known but scarcely less interesting neighboring 
city of Gubbio. A charming preface, in French, 
is furnished by Monsieur Paul Sabatierj the 
dedication to the Bishop of Gubbio is in Ital- 
ian; and there is a good outline map of the 
city numbered with sixtj'-two localities of in- 
terest.— Covering a somewhat similar ground 
to the foregoing is the book called * Pictures in 
Umbria' (imported by Charles Scribner's Sons), 
by Miss Katharine S. Macquoid. It is, however, 
a much less original and valuable work. In fact, 
the text is so trite and prosaic that it gives the 
impression of being written merely for the sake 
of furnishing a setting for the fifty original il- 
lustrations from sketches made by Thomas R. 
Macquoid, R. I. Perhaps this is a sufficient jus- 
tification, however; for the pictures are certainly 
charming. One never sees the hill-towns of 
Umbria too often, nor dwells too long among 
them; and next to the pleasure of actual pres- 
ence is the satisfaction conveyed by picturesque 
presentation of these choice bits of scenery or 
works of art by a genuine artist. Perugia and 
Assisi furnish the principal subjects; but there 
are scenes also from Spello, Cortona, and Lake 
Thrasymene. 

A human document of surpassing 
interest to those who have stud- 
ied the life and career of Wag- 
ner is William Ashton Ellis's compilation of 
letters, published under the title of 'Richard 
Wagner to Mathilde Wesendonck' (imported by 
Charles Scribner's Sons). The matter contained 
in the volume includes letters to and fi*om 
Mathilde Wesendonck, designed to shoAV the 
sentiments which actuated Wagner to begin and 
carry on what some are pleased to refer to as 
a dual life, and will go far to modify the gen- 
eral opinion of this relationship as held by Eng- 
lish-speaking people. The reader is left to a 
certain extent to form his own opinion upon 
the progress of events, from the private letters 
and extracts from diaries Avhich are presented 
very fully. That the biographer has not pur- 
sued this cause from want of sympathy with his 
subject is evident from the introductory re- 
marks and subsequent comments, in which he 
leaves no doubt of his sincere and hearty ad- 
miration of Wagner's character and career. If 
the work has been performed conscientiously,— 
that is, if there has been no improper discrim- 
ination in the selections from private corre- 
spondence, nothing omitted which Avould tend 



Wagtier and 
Frau Wesendonck 



to dcA'elop the real character of the man, — the 
plan is unobjectionable, even admirable, as it 
brings the man himself verA' near to the reader. 
Of Mathilde, Mr. Ellis says: 'Her personality? 
No one admitted to the honour of Frau Wes- 
endonck 's society during the last thirty years of 
her life— and here I can speak from personal 
experience, hoAvever slight— could for a moment 
belieA'e her to ha\'e ever been the heroine of 
Avhat the baser sort imply Avhen they speak of a 
''Tristan-and-Isolde romance." This placid, 
SAveet Madonna, the perfect emblem of a pearl, 
not opal, her eyes still dreaming of Nirvana,— 
no! emphatically no! she could not haA-e once 
been swayed by carnal passion. And these let- 
ters, in bulk and in detail, most flatly contra- 
dict that implication: nay, more,— they prove 
the justice of my old contention, not mine alone, 
that the second act of Wagner's drama excludes 
all possibility of his Tristan, his Isolde, being 
victims to a coarse desire. In these letters all 
is pure and spiritual, a Dante and a Beatrice; 
so must it have been in their intercourse. From 
my own impression of their recipient— Avhom I 
first met in that sad year at Bayreuth Avhen 
the master was no more— it Avas that of the 
silver moon reflecting a sun that has set long 
since. Not a word ever fell from her lips on 
such a love as is revealed here; but every ac- 
cent of her voice, the gathering moisture in her 
eye, spelt Avorship; and from her it Avas I ear- 
liest learnt a truth which added years have sim- 
ply A-erified: that in Richard Wagner Ave have 
more than a great— a profoundly good man.' 
In summing up the result of this published cor- 
respondence, Mr. Ellis asks, Would Wagner and 
Frau Wesendonck have been happier had they 
left their respective homes together? And he 
contends that their love had sublimated into 
something too ethereal, by the time of its decla- 
ration, not to run risk of dispersion by the in- 
evitable shocks of daily intercourse. 'Besides 
a gifted brain and inbred tact, it needed an un- 
usually strong character really to be a prop and 
moderator to a genius Avhose ideas of practical 
life had become so largely tinged with that 
transcendency which stamps his artAvorks. ' 
When she died, in the month of August, 1902, 
Mathilde Wesendonck Avas making ready for the 
presentation of these lettei's to posterity.

sire for more fare of the same sort from those 
formidable 'twenty-eight folio volumes' of man- 
uscript. The letters of this gouty, port-drink- 
inff, free-living, pluralist churchman to his 
equally prosperous and likewise pluralist crony, 
have something in their tone and in the pic- 
ture they present of society life and manners, 
and of ecclesiastical squabbles, that reminds one 
of Carlyle's opinion of the century to which 
they belong. To him it was a swindler-century, 
opiUent in accumulated falsities; a century that 
erelong became unconscious of being false, so 
false had it grown; so steeped in falsity, so 
fraudulent-bankrupt, the measure of its in- 
iquity so full, that it needed a French Revolu- 
tion to square the account. It was a century in 
which, as we read in Pyle's letters, a King of 
England could tell an Archbishop of Canterbury 
to his face that 'he was a man of a little dirty 
heart'; a non-compliment that the prelate in 
question. Archbishop John Potter, appears to 
have felt that he deserved; at any rate, the roy- 
al displeasure broke his heart, whether dirty or 
clean, and he died soon afterward, calling forth 
from some read}- rhymster the epitaph,— 

' Alack, and well-a-day. 

Potter himself is turned to clay.' 

Mr, Hartshorne's labors have at least fur- 
nished a useful source-book for historians of the 
period, however lacking it may be in the con- 
tinuous, absorbing interest that lures the spell- 
bound reader, blissfully insensible of dog-day 
sultriness and ener\-ating heat, from page to 
page and from one delightful chapter to its 
more entrancing successor. 

Mirabeau and The French Revolution apparently 
the French remains a favorite field for the 

Revolution. display of a somewhat spectacular 

rhetoric. The most recent instance is Mr. C. F. 
WarAviek's 'Mirabeau and the French Revolution' 
(Lippincott). The illustrations are in keeping 
with this treatment of the subject. One of them 
represents a peasant lying prostrate in his vine- 
yard, ridden down by the gay sportsmen who are 
gallopping thoughtlessly on toward an artistic 
sunset. The author's manner becomes more direct 
as soon as the details of Mirabeau 's story absorb 
his attention. His remarks on the condition of 
France under the old regime and of the course of 
the Revolution are, however, often misleading and 
inexact. M. Aulard, the distinguished professor 
of the history of the Revolution in the University 
of Paris, has estimated that about twenty years 
are required to make oneself acquainted with the 
materials for the political history of the Revolu- 
tion. Perhaps so long an apprenticeship is not 
indispensable, but the lack of it renders hazardous 
the attempt to describe the careers of men like 
Mirabeau, Danton, or Robespierre, whose lives 
lose their significance unless the historical back- 
ground is faithfully portrayed. Many scenes of 
the Revolution arouse the imagination, which can 
be kept in restraint only by constant contact with 
the facts in the case. In this book, instead of 
what occurred on the night of July 12, 1789, there 
is a fanciful picture of revolutionary horrors. The 



Bastille is said to have been 'in a complete state 
of defence, ' although De Launay had done nothing 
toward accumulating a store of pro\"isions and 
there was no oven in the fortress except one for 
pastry. It is an error of another kind to say that 
Sieyes 'schemed with Napoleon and Ducos to 
establish the Directorate. ' 

The volume on John Bunvan in 
Tjohn*iZ:::l the 'Literary Lives' seriesJScrib- 

ner) is written by Mr. W illiam 
Hale White, better known as 'Mark Rutherford.' 
His name on the title-page is a guarantee of 
good work, and the book proves to be a sym- 
pathetic, even a devout, study of its interesting 
theme. A footnote gives some indication of the 
present commercial value of Bimyaniana. The 
warrant for Bunyan's arrest in 1676, a brief 
document given in reduced facsimile by Mr. 
White, was last year acquired by Quaritch for 
305£. This six-months imprisonment of 1676 
was made especially memorable by the writing 
of the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' Mr. White finds a 
curious likeness between Bunyan's fiend-haunted 
melancholy and Johnson's recurrent spells of 
dark despair. He writes: 'It is strange, by the 
way, that Johnson resembled Buuyan. His 
spectres haunted Johnson, and the "History of 
My Melancholy," which he once thought of 
writing, would undoubtedly have reminded us of 
another history by the author of the "Pilgrim's 
Progress" which he loved so well.' The closing 
paragraph of this scholarly biography is sig- 
nificant as showing a certain excellent balance 
of Hebraism and Hellenism (to use again Mat- 
thew Arnold's convenient terms) in the writer. 
'Puritanism has done noble service,' he says; 
'but we have seen enough of it even in Bunyaa 
to show that it is not an entirely accurate ver- 
sion of God's message to man. It is the most 
distinct, energetic and salutary movement in 
our history, and no other religion has surpassed 
it in preaching the truths by which men and 
nations must exist. Nevertheless we need 
Shakesi>eare as well as Bunyan, and oscillate be- 
tween the "Pilgrim's Progress" and "As You • 
Like It." We cannot bring ourselves into tmity. 
The time is yet to come when we shall live by 
a faith which is a harmony of all our facul- 
ties.' 

Popular beliefs Probably no book regarding pop- 
and practices tilar beliefs -and practices has 
of Great Britain, jjj^^j ^ jvidcT vogue than Brand's 
'Popular Antiquities of Great Britain.' Brand 
was himself but an editor, and his 'Popular An- 
tiquities,' printed in 1777, was really a revised 
edition and enlargement of a book by the Rev. 
Henry Bourne, published in 1725 under the 
title of ' Antiquitates Vulgares.' Brand's book 
was republished and edited by Ellis in 1813; a 
later edition of it, the one best known to the 
present generation of readers, was brought out 
by Mr. Carew Hazlitt in 1870. The book before 
us is really the old Boume-Brand-Ellis-Hazlitt 
book in new form, with the title 'Faiths and 
Folk-lore' (imported by Charles Seribner's 
Sons). Mr. Hazlitt has thrown the material 



120 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



into dictionary style, cutting and separating the 
older articles into brief passages arranged in 
alphabetical order. One may still read Brand 
with satisfaction, but the work before us is a 
constant irritation. Three legitimate courses 
were open to Mr. Hazlitt: he might have re- 
issued his Brand of 1870 without change; he 
might have given the same matter in this new 
form; he might have given the whole of Brand 
in dictionary style and added to it so much of 
the result of Folk-lore study since 1870 as 
would have made the Avork a reflection of pres- 
ent thought and knowledge. He has done no 
one of these things. The reader has a right to 
demand of a dictionary,— and Mr. Hazlitt calls 
the book before us a dictionary,— that it should 
be complete and symmetrically developed. Mr. 
Hazlitt has added some material to the old 
book, but neither in quantity nor in quality is it 
worth while. Most of it is newspaper clippings 
culled at random, and both in ari-angement and 
subject shows no sense of proportion or definite 
plan.

the beholder has sufficient grace of poetry 
in heart and eye to discover them. There- 
fore are they rare; yet quite as often ex- 
isting within sight of one's own doorstep as 
when one has travelled far afield in search of 
them. This is the theory of Vernon Lee, when 
she chooses this title for a book (John Lane) 
about the places that she loves. Whither her 
footsteps go, the Genius of Peace cannot long 
remain hidden. In these thirty chapters, there 
is no orderly sequence, no effort. The writer 
has found that the most interesting places are 
those which we stray into, or just deflect 
toward, as we wander for the sake of friends or 
work, or even in humbler quest of cheapness of 
living or benefit to health. How many times 
lias the wearied sight-seer in foreign lands dis- 
covered this by sad experience! How often has 
• it been forced upon him that the best travel 
is not that which he has done for travelling's 
•sake, and that the rainbow's pot of gold was 
really at the end of his own garden-plot, and 
not over-seas! The habitual grace of Vernon 
Lee's style is present in these pages, and her 
unfailing vivacity makes her the most delight- 
ful of couriers and engaging of companions. 

rrhe French -^ volume from India on the 

Revolution French Revolution irresistibly re- 

seen from India, ealls to mind the Citizen Tipu, 
whom the Revolutionists relied upon to drive 'the 
minions of Perfidious Albion ' from Madras, if not 
from all India. The little book by Professor P. 
A. Wadia, of Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, on 
■*The Philosophers and the French Revolution' 
(Scribner) has, however, only this somewhat 
remote geographical association with the Sultan 
of Mysore. It is an essay written to show the 
falsity of the view which ascribes the Revolution 
largely to the teachings of the eighteenth century 
philosophers. Professor Wadia regards both it 



and them as illustrations of the extreme tenden- 
cies of that individualism which had its beginnings 
in the Renaissance. The philosophers simply 
gave skilful expression to currents of feeling and 
thought which ran through all French intellectual 
life. In the same way the author finds the 
attacks on religion and the riotous tendencies to 
have been characteristic of the French people 
long before the Revolution began. Were it within 
the scope of this essay, doubtless he would have 
pointed out that all, opinions as well as conduct, 
were evidence that the defects of the old regime 
were so grievous as to provoke protest of the most 
radical type. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



' The Works of Lucian of Samosata,' with a few 
omissions (either because of questionable author- 
ship or by way of expurgation), translated from 
Jacobitz's (Teubner) text by Messrs. H. W. Fowler 
and F. G. Fowler, are published in a neat four-vol- 
ume edition at the Oxford Clarendon Press. The 
translation is for the general reader, being notably 
idiomatic, especially in the Dialogues. This edition 
of one of the most modern of the ancients is a veri- 
table boon, and we give it a hearty welcome. 

The single volume of nine hundred pages into 
which have been collected ' The Philosophical 
Works of Francis Bacon ' (Button) will prove a 
boon to scholars who have to be economical in the 
matter of library space. The reprint includes the 
greater part of the monumental edition of Ellis and 
Spedding, with their prefaces and notes, and it 
would be a verj' special student indeed who would 
read any of the matter now omitted. Professor 
John M. Eobertson is the editor of this most accept- 
able volume. 

'The Flying Lesson' is the title given by Miss 
Agnes Tobin to a small volume of translations 
from Petrarch, published by Mr. William Heine- 
mann. This is Miss Tobin 's second venture of the 
sort, and includes ten sonnets, two canzoni, a 
ballata, and a double sestina. Miss Tobin writes 
fairly good Petrarch and very good poetry, which 
is so much more than most translators give us 
that it would be ungracious to insist upon the 
essential untranslatability of her chosen poet. The 
little book is exquisitely printed, and adorned with 
a beautiful etched frontispiece 'in morte di Ma- 
donna Laura.' 

In Beryl D. de Selincourt's 'Homes of the First 
Franciscans' (Dent-Dutton), we have a successful 
attempt to show to what a degree the character and 
teachings of St. Francis of Assisi were shaped and 
illustrated by his surroundings. Fortunately, the 
intervening centuries have dealt kindly with the 
Franciscan haunts; one may still penetrate into the 
heart of the past in the solitudes elected by Francis 
and his followers. Naturally, Assisi takes the first 
and longest place in the book; but also there are 
ample chapters on the District of Lake Thrasymene, 
Monte Casall, the Valley of Eieti, La Terna, etc., 
which help to explain those legends of miracle 
which soon began to spring up around the Pover- 
ello. Monsieur Paul Sabatier, the great biographer 
of the Franciscans, furnishes a brief preface to the 
volume; the illustrations are from charming photo- 
graphs made expressly for this work; and there is an 
outline map showing those portions of Umbria, 
Tuscany, and the Northern Marches, wherein the 
Franciscan community lived their intense inner life.

' Will Warburton ' is the title of a posthumous 
novel by the late George Gissing, announced for 
early publication by Messrs. E, P. Button & Co. 

By presidential proclamation, Norway is now 
added to the list of countries whose citizens may 
obtain copyright in the United States under the Act 
of 1891. 

' The Handbook of Princeton,' a handsomely 
printed and illustrated volume, the work of Mr. 
John Rogers Williams, is published at the Grafton 
Press. President Wilson contributes an introduc- 
tion. 

We are glad to see that Mr. Edward Verrall 
Lucas's excellent ' Book of Verses for Children ' 
(Holt) has proved successful enough to warrant the 
publication of a new edition in cheaper form. The* 
text remains unchanged. 

A new uniform edition of Thomas Hardy's novels, 
complete in twenty volumes, is being prepared by 
the Messrs. Harper. The ' Wessex ' edition, as 
it is called, wUl be amply illustrated, and is pri- 
marily intended to be sold by subscription. 

A new novel by Mr. Robert Neilson Stephens, en- 
titled ' The Flight of Georgiana,' will be published 
at once by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. The same firm 
have nearly ready ' The Grapple,' a story of labor 
troubles in the Illinois coal mines, by Miss Grace 
McGowan Cooke. 

A dainty little volume that will appeal to every 
lover of Stevenson is ' The Pocket R. L. S.,' pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Scribner. As may be inferred 
from the title, it is a collection of favorite passages, 
brought together * for the use of those who love 
Stevenson and call him Master.' 

Forthcoming issues in the ' English Men of Let- 
ters' series will include volumes on Andrew Mar- 
veil, Sir Thomas Browne, Mrs. Gaskell, Charles Kings- 
ley, and Shakespeare, written respectively by Messrs. 
Augustine Birrell, Edmund Gosse, Clement Shorter, 
G. K. Chesterton, and Walter Raleigh. 

A new volume of poems by Mr. Richard Watson 
Gilder will be issued by the Century Co. this 
fall. * In the Heights ' will gather into permanent 
form nearly all of the verse Mr. Gilder has written 
since the publication, in 1901, of his ' Poems and 
Inscriptions. ' 

A collected edition of the poems of Mr. John 
Vance Cheney is in preparation by Messrs. Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. The volume will contain a gen- 
erous selection of the best of Mr. Cheney's work, 
chosen from his half-dozen published books of verse 
and his numerous magazine contributions of the 
past few years. 

Embodying as it will a quantity of new material 
and the results of years of special study, Mr. E. V. 
Lucas's forthcoming Life of Charles and Mary 
Lamb is likely to prove the most interesting con- 
tribution to Lamb biography since Talfourd's ' Final 
Memorials.' The work, which will be amply illus- 
trated, is announced for early publication by the 
Messrs. Putnam. 

Professor W. P. Trent's ' Southern Writers ' 
(Macmillan) is a volume of selections in prose and 
verse from upwards of eighty authors, from the re- 
doubtable Captain John Smith to such youthful 
poets of the present day as Mr. Peck, Mr.'Cawein, 
and Mr. Loveman. It has brief biographies and 
notes, and is altogether an admirable piece of edi- 
torial workmanship. Its special aim is to provide a 
manual for use in Southern schools and colleges in 
connection with the study of American literature. 



but we predict for it a wider range of usefulness 
than that. It is certainly calculated to open the 
eyes of many provinciaUy-minded persons, and to 
persuade them that the literary South is by no 
means a negligible part of oar national intellectual 
domain. 

A reissue of Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace's 

* Russia,' by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., is timely, 
and the work is brought up to date by extensive 
revisions. It was the first big book of general 
information about Russia that we had, and it has 
never been wholly superseded. In its new form, 
it resumes its place at the head of the extensive 
literature of the subject. 

A biography of that obscure seventeenth-century 
dramatist, Lodowiek Carliell, with a reprint of his 
tragic-comedy, 'The Deserving Favourite,' is given 
us in a volume edited by Professor Charles H. 
Gray, and published at the University of Chicago 
Press. We have with the same imprint a dis- 
sertation on 'Some Principles of Elizabethan Stag- 
ing, ' by Mr. George F. Reynolds. 

* With Shelley in Italy,' edited by Mrs. Anna 
Benneson McMahan, is announced for fall publica- 
tion by Messrs. McClurg & Co., as a companion vol- 
ume to the same editor's successful book of last 
year called ' Florence in the Poetry of the Brown- 
ings.' The new volume consists of a selection of the 
poems and letters of Shelley which have to do with 
his life in Italy from 1818 to 1822. The illustra- 
tions will comprise some sixty reproductiona from 
photographs. 

Three interesting books of travel and description 
are contained in Messrs. McClurg 's fall announce- 
ment list. Most important of these is a translation 
of the Abb6 FeUx Klein 's account of his recent visit 
to the United States, to be published under the title 

* In the Land of the Strenuous Life.' The other 
two volumes are Miss Matilda Betham-Edwards's 
description of ' Home Life in France,' and Mr. 
Ernest F. G. Hatch 's record of a recent tour in 
Japan, Corea, and China, entitled ' Far Eastern Im- 
pressions. ' 

Qne of the more important publishing enterprises 
of the fall season is announced by the Messrs. 
Putnam in a ' Federal ' edition of Abraham Lin- 
coln's writings, to comprise probably eight volumes. 
Th^ editing of this work has been entrusted to Mr. 
Arthur Brooks Lapsley, who will contribute an in- 
troduction and occasional brief footnotes. The late 
Noah Brooks's life of Lincoln, the essay on Lincoln 
by Carl Schurz, and the address by Hon. Joseph H. 
Choate will also be included in the edition. The 
volumes will be illustrated with a full series of por- 
traits of Lincoln and of the distinguished Americans 
of his time. 

' The Muse's Library,' gratefully known to all 
lovers of English poetry, has recently passed into 
the hands of the Messrs. Routledge, and is now re- 
issued by them in a slightly reduced size of volume, 
at a surprisingly low price. Messrs. E. J*. Dutton 
& Co. are the American agents for this edition, 
which comprises twenty-five volumes, as follows: 
Browne (2), Vaughan (2), Marvell (2), Donne (2), 
Waller (2), Gay (2), Drummond (2), Herrick (2), 
Carew (1), Johnson, Goldsmith, Gray, and Collins 
(1), Blake (1). Coleridge (1), Keats (2), Coventry 
Patmore (1), Poe (1), and Adelaide Anne Proc-

and each poet has an introductory essay. Among 
these essays we note the Herrick, by Mr. Swinburne, 
the Blake, by Mr. Yeats, the Keats, by Mr. Bridges, 
the Coleridge, by Dr. Garnett, the Browne, "by Mr.

BOOKS FOR EDUCATORS 



A New Series of Life-Stories for Supplementary Reading and Nature 
Study work in the Elementary^ Middle^ and Upper Grades 

The Life and Nature Series 

Selected, Edited, and Arranged by CHARLES WELSH 
'T^HIS is a series of Life Stories by some well-known men and women for use 
-*- in supplementary Reading and Nature Study in the grades, presenting 
their work without further editing or adapting than is necessary to fit them for 
the schools — a brief introduction, showing the place and use of each in the 
school-work, and a set of questions for the use of teachers in review work at the 
end of those books that need such. Notes of any kind have been eschewed ; 
they are not necessary in the books for the lower grades, and it is better to send 
the children in the higher grades to the dictionary and books of reference for 
the meaning of unfamiliar words and remote allusions than to make their work 
too easy by means of notes. 

A complete prospectus will be sent upon request.

THE GREAT ENGLISH POETS 

With a Critical Introduction and an Essay on the 
Reading of English Poetry by SHERWIN CODY 

Editor of " The World's Greatest Short Stories," *' The Best English Essays," 
" The World's Great Orations," Etc. 

'* I ^O MR. CODY must belong the credit of having discovered a new field in 
-■- "practical" literature, the foresight of having realized its possibilities, and 
the industry to develop it consistently and logically. His compilations have 
been remarkably successful both in a popular sense and with educators ; his 
books have been adopted in many leading institutions, and to these especially 
the announcement of this new volume will be most welcome. 

It does not conflict with any existing anthology, and it is marked by all the 
distinctive features which have made his other books so useful — the helpful 
general introduction, the discerning comments on the work of the great poets, 
and the instinctive good taste and editorial sense shown in the selections.

Cry d O L//\<JVJ1I 1 CKO FROM WORLD-WIDE SOURCES 

Compiled by A Mere Man and portrayed by A. Q. Learned 

" Eve's Daughters " flashes like a case of jewels. It borrows from the wit, wisdom, and brilliancy of many literatures. Unnsoal taste has 
been shown in the selection of material. A gentle tone of satire adds pungency to many of the aphorisms, but the note of contempt for women 
which has marred most of the witty writings about them in all ages is carefully avoided ; as also is the note of coarseness. Etsrt faos has an 
artistic and exquisite line illustration. The delicate marginal drawings, as well as the full-page designs, are made with rare skill by the cele- 
brated American artist, A. G. Learned, whose covers for the Ladiei Home Journal are well known. It is one of the most unique gift books 
which has appeared from any American press in a number of years.

important new words, illustrations, colored plates, and special features, embracing every department of human 
endeavor. The firet time in the history of Dictionary making that the public have been enabled to procure a compact, 
but comprehensive dictionary embodying all of the principal Encyclopedic features of the large cumbersome lexicons, and 
at a price within the reach of all. Twenty-seven copyrighted features granted by the Librarian of Congress. 



New and Technical Words 

Hundreds of new words appearing now for 
the first time in a lexicon. Electricity, Med- 
ical Science, and the Professions are all repre- 
sented by the very latest coinages. 



Method of Treatment 

The system of indicating proper nouns by 
capital initials is a feature not found in simi- 
lar lexicons. Present, past participle, and 
imperfect tense of verbs, plural of nouns, 
degrees of adjectives, synonyms, and the 
latest etymologies are all given. 



Illustrations 

Illustrations are encyclopedic in character. 
Numerous full-page plates are distinct, edu- 
cative features, while the beautiful ten col- 
ored lithographs are features not even found 
in most of the large expensive dictionaries.

\(^ A Powerful Endorsement. .Mi 

For many years I have received from leading publishing houses, 
from time to time, many new books with the request to examine and 
pronounce on their merits. Recently I have received from Laird 
& Lee, of Chicago, a copy of WEBSTER'S NEW STANDARD 
DICTIONARY, which at once interested me, as it was in a field 
to which I have given much careful attention. The examina- 
tion of this book has been a genuine pleasure and a perpetual 
surprise to find an accumulation of such excellencies. Its 
superiority to any Common or High School Dictionary is too appar- 
ent to be discussed. Altogether it seems to be beyond question 
the very best School Dictionary that has ever come to my notice. 
Very respectfully yours, P. H. EAGER, 

Professor of English, Mississippi College, Clinton, Miss. 



This series of dictionaries contains more important features than any similar set of lexicons published in the "world. 
Each volume contains a key to pronunciation foot of each page. The diacritical markings are simple, comprehensive, 
scientific, and based upon standard authorities, recognized by all educators and used in all schools. Uniform ut raakeap, 
special cover designs, marking the series separate and distinct from any other on the market. 

For sale at all bookstores, by all jobbers, news companies and school-book supply dealers, 
or sent direct, on receipt of price, by the publishers

Stokes's NEW Autumn NOVELS 
A SERVANT of the PUBLIC 

By ANTHONY HOPE 
Author of ««Quisante," "Phroso," "The Prisoner of Zenda," etc. 

" It is easy to be enthusiastic about the story. It is psychologic — but with a difference, the differ- 
ence being the bright and compelling interest of Mr. Hope's dialogue, and the smiling sanity of his spirit. 
Imagine much that is best in Meredith or James, and all that is best in Anthony Hope, and you have a 
fair idea of ' A Servant of the Public' It is not the conventional story of the stage, with glib talk of 
the greenroom, and intimate glimpses ' behind the footlights.' It is the story of an actress off, rather 
than on, the stage — an analysis of the theatrical, perhaps ' artistic,' temperament." — Hew York Globe. 

With four illustrations by Harold Percival. Cloth, 12nio, $1.50 

The SPECULATIONS of JOHN STEELE

Author of "The Victors," "Tekla," etc.

"A Yeab Book of Kbittucky Woods and Fields," etc. 

'T'HIS is the remarkable story of a young man who, at first earnestly embracing Christadelphianism, gradually 
grows out of its narrowness into fuller light. His spirituality, his bitter experience through a literal inter- 
pretation of the doctrine of non-resistance ; his views on the destiny of Russia ; his comradeship with " Brother 
Nathanael," a noble type of the true Christ-life, — all are set forth with the sureness of touch of a writer who 
has thought deeply and who writes as only an artist in words can write. 

An eminent critic says of Mr. Crockett : " He takes rank with Burroughs, Thoreau, and Bradford Torrey."

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .... 172 
(A classified list of books announced for publica- 
taoB during the coming Fall and Winter season.) 



BOOKS OF TH E COM ING SEASON. 

The long list of publications announced for 
the season just now opening — a list comprising 
upwards of fifteen hundred titles — is now be- 
fore us, and invites to pleasurable anticipations. 
Persons of intellectual and literary interests 
derive from such a list as this much the same 
sort of satisfaction that devotees of music and 
the drama derive from an advance statement 
of managerial plans accompanied by lists of 
plays and visiting celebrities. The lover of 
books, also, has an advantage over the amateur 
of the theatre and the concert-room in the fact 
that the delights to which he looks forward will 
be the more certainly accessible, for they will 
not be limited by the special restrictions of time 
and place that belong to play going; nor will 
they — thanks to the blessing of free libraries — 
be denied hun by their cost. One may exam- 
ine such a list as the present with the practical 
certainty that any book it contains may be read 
if one will, soon after publication ; provided, of 
course, that one lives in some fairly populous 
community. 

As is our custom in connection with this 
'Fall Announcement' issue of The Dial, we 
now select for particular mention such few of 
the forthcoming books as seem to promise the 
most marked satisfaction, — remembering, how- 
ever, that literature has its disappointments no 
less than its joys. Our selection is confined to 
the small number of categories that are most 
closely related to literature, leaving untouched 
the vast tracts devoted to such subjects as art 
and science, education and religion, and making 
no account whatever of the hundreds of books 
designed as holiday gifts for old and young. 

Ajnong books seriously concerned with lit- 
erature, the collection of Dr. Ibsen's * Letters ' 
would seem to be the most significant thing in 
prospect. These letters have already appeared 
in several European languages, and they are 
now to be given to the public of the two Eng- 
lish-speaking countries. The late Lady 
Dilke's 'Book of the Spiritual Life' will be 
certain to make a deep appeal to serious minds. 
Mr. Henry James, so recently with us, will be 
kept in mind (if that were necessary), by the 
publication of the two essays that he read before 
various private audiences last winter, and by 
Miss Elisabeth Luther Car/s elaborate discus- 
sion of his work. We note that after many 



156 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



years' delay the French Ambassador has pre- 
pared for publication the second volume of his 
* Literary History of the English People/ a 
work that will be all the more welcome for the 
long time we have had to wait for it. Prom- 
ising collections of literary essays are ' French 
Profiles/ by Mr. Gosse; 'The Torch/ by Pro- 
fessor Woodberry ; and ' Greatness in Litera- 
ture/ by Professor Trent. 

In the field of literary biography, several 
highly important works are announced. Per- 
haps the most important is Bielschowsky's ex- 
tensive biography of Goethe. It may not be 
alt-ogether amiss to mention here the musical 
biography of Tschaikowsky, by the brother of 
the great composer. Mrs. Pennell's ' Hans 
Breitman/ Mrs. Marie Hansen Taylor's *0n 
Two Continents/ and Colonel Higginson's 
' Parts of a Man's Life/ are three contributions 
to the history of American literature that can- 
not fail to be interesting. British biography 
will be enriched by Mr. Lucas's very thorough 
work on Charles and Mary Lamb and by Mr. 
Herbert Paul's life of Froude. Volumes on 
Marvell, Browne, Mrs. Gaskell, Charles Kings- 
ley, and Shakespeare, will be added to the 
'English Men of Letters' series. To the 
'American Men of Letters/ the long-delayed 
volume on Lowell will be added, and also one 
on Lanier. The ' French Men of Letters ' will 
be auspiciously inaugurated by Professor Dow- 
den's Montaigne and M. Brunetiere's Balzac. 
Professor Woodberry will contribute a small 
volume on Swinburne to the ' Contemporary 
Men of Letters' series. 

From books about literature to books of lit- 
erature the transition is natural; and here, of 
course, we are confronted with the great fact 
of the dominance of the novel. We give a brief 
list chosen with much hesitation from several 
hundreds of titles : ' The House of Mirth/ by 
Mrs. Edith Wharton ; ' The Eeckoning,' by Mr. 
E. W. Chambers; 'The Coming of the Tide,' 
by Miss Margaret Sherwood ; ' Coniston/ by 
Mr. Winston Churchill ; ' The Wheel of Life,' 
by Miss Ellen Glasgow ; ' A Sword of the Old 
Frontier,' by Mr. Eandall Parrish ; ' The Man 
of the Hour/ by Miss Alice French; and 
' Eaoul : the Story of the Theft of an Empire,' 
by Mr. J. W. Ludlow. Against these Amer- 
ican titles we may set the following English 
ones : ' The Story of a Simple Soul,' by Mr. 
H. G. Wells; 'The Mayor of Troy/ by Mr. 
A. T. Quiller-Couch; 'The Tents of Pan/ by 
Mrs. Craigie ; ' The Hundred Days/ by Mr. 
Max Pemberton; 'The Lake,' by Mr. George 
Moore ; ' Helianthus/ by ' Ouida ;' ' Starvecrow 
Farm,' by Mr. Stanley J. Weyman ; and ' The 
Trident and the Net,' by the author of \ The 
Martyrdom of an Empress.' Probably a bigger 
work of fiction than any of these will be the 



translation of 'Peter and Alexis ' from the Eus- 
sian of Merejkowski, completing his * Christ 
and Antichrist' trilogy. We aJso learn from 
the English reviews that a new novel by Mr. 
Watts-Dunton may be expected before long. 

The writer last-named naturally suggests Mr. 
Swinburne, which reminds us to say that his 
' Tragedies,' in five volumes, are now appearing 
in England, and we shall doubtless soon have 
them in an edition uniform with the poems. 
The only announcements of new poetry having 
any special significance are the ' Nero ' of Mr. 
Stephen Phillips; Mr. E. W. Gilder's 'In the 
Heights'; the poems of that brilliant young 
Harvard graduate, the late Trumbull Stickney; 
and a collection of ' Last Poems ' by the Eng- 
lish lady who called herself ' Laurence Hope,' 
and whose tragic death in India was chronicled 
about a year ago. 

A final paragraph of this conspectus may be 
given to a few important works not classifiable 
under the above headings. In history we note 
M. Hanotaux's ' Contemporary France/ Cap- 
tain Mahan's ' Sea Power in Its Eelation to the 
War of 1812,' Professor Breasted's ' A Historv 
of Egypt/ Professor H. T. Peck's 'Twenty 
Years of the Eepublic,' and the volume on ' Na- 
poleon and His Times ' in the * Cambridge 
Modern History.' Pleasant reading is sure to 
be afforded by the ' London Films ' of Mr. How- 
ells, and 'The Fields of France/ by Mme. 
Mary Duclaux (Mary A. F. Eobinson). The 
reader of philosophical leanings will eagerly 
await Professor Hoffding's ' Philosophical Prob- 
lems,' Professor Jastrow's treatise on ' The Sub- 
conscious,' and Mr. Mallock's chapters on ' The 
Eeconstruction of Eeligious Beliefs.' ' A His- 
tory of Political Theories' will be made more 
than readable by the brilliant pen of Professor 
Dunning; while Professor Shaler's 'Man and 
the Earth' will provide food for serious eco- 
nomic reflection. Finally, as the aftermath of 
the recent war, we note the prospect of many 
books about Eussia, among which Dr. Dillon's 
' The Birth of the Eussian Nation ' will as- 
suredly take a high place. 



ON STYLE IN LI TERATURE. 

Everybody talks about style, and no one 
knows what it is. Writers who ought to be 
better informed by experience speak of it as if 
it were something that could be bought at a 
shop and wrapped up in brown paper. They 
talk of its being acquired, — which in any real 
sense is as impossible as to add a cubit to one's 
stature. They discuss it as if it were one cer- 
tain thing — whereas it is a veritable Proteus. 
Leibnitz's principle of indiscemibility applies 



1905.] 



THE DIAL, 



157 



to it more than to any other matter. If no 
two leaves in a forest are alike, far less are 
the styles of any two writers alike. Every 
author has some sort of a style, good or bad. 
And of good style probably the most that can 
be said is that it is the quality in books which 
makes and keeps them readable. If a man has 
a rich nature, a full mind, a knowledge of the 
grammar and vocabulary of his language, the 
only advice he needs in regard to style is the 
direction which an old pilot gave for navigat- 
ing the Amazon: *Keep between the banks, 
and go ahead.' 

Style is indeed the product of the whole 
man. It must show the form of his soul, eagle- 
winged or serpent- winding. There will ring in 
it an echo of all his exultations, agonies, divina- 
tions, darings. It must betray the resources of 
his reason. What logic and lucidity he is pos- 
sessed of will come out in the clear designs, the 
ordered architectural arrangement of his work, 
both in its entirety' and in its clauses and sen- 
tences. It must exhibit his physical instincts 
in its sensuous reaching for concrete images, its 
organization of words into form and color and 
music. The reason we associate style with 
prose rather than with poetry is because verse 
is a balance of all these qualities. Without in- 
spiration, without ordinance, without the vivid 
and sounding collocation of words, it falls to 
the ground and becomes nothing. It cannot 
sail on one wing or hop on one foot. Poetry 
is all style; whereas prose usually has one or 
another of the attributes of style missing or in 
excess, and our attention is thus arrested, and 
from its lack of balance we give the thing a 
name. The two great masters of English verse 
in the eighteenth century were mighty wielders 
of words. In the face of the fact that our ordi- 
nary speech is shot through with their lines 
and phrases, it seems senseless as well as un- 
grateful to deny them the title of poets. But 
their verse was an invasion of prose. Of style, 
they only employed that part which belongs 
peculiarly to prose composition, logical order, 
lucid statement, wit and wisdom. They aban- 
doned the Orphic utterance; they did not 
achieve the sensuous realizations of poetry. 
Wordsworth remounted the tripod of inspira- 
tion, and Keats waved anew the Bacchanalian 
thyrsus; and since their time there has been 
no cause to lament the lack of fire or form in 
style. Eather, if anything, the physical ele- 
ment of style has been too predominant. 

It is in connection with words rather than 
with ideas that most people think of style, — 
as if words were not merely the symbols of 
thought. In a moderate number of instances 
there mav be some subtle aflfinitv between the 



look and sound of words and their meanings. 
Onomatopoeia of course exists. Oftener the 
aflfinity is due to associations which words may 
have acquired. They may bring with them a 
trail of glory from the past, — or, like good 
servants, a letter of recommendation from their 
previous employers. They may be forgotten 
metaphors, or coins from the treasure-houses 
of foreign tongues. Sometimes their fitness is 
due to their noble physiognomy or lordly sound. 
Mesopotamia thrilled one bosom with sacred 
awe. Great poets have always known how to 
use magnificent names with effect. Yet, after 
all, it must have occurred to many people that 
the English race at least has rather made a 
failure of that which is perhaps its chief work 
— its Dictionary. T^ere is no reason why all 
our words should not have been created fit and 
noble, — ^as the whole Spanish army was once 
created Hidalgo. As it is, the great mass of 
our words are low or indifferent, — good enough 
for bread-and-butter uses, or the purposes of 
trade, but decidedly lacking in distinction. 
Aristocratic vocables are as rare as dukes and 
princes. It would take a treatise to show this 
in detail, but I will give a few instances, prem- 
ising that my own judgment is the only rule 
of rank which I have used. 

The most commonly used names of things — 
nouns — of our language are rather bad than 
good. * Ocean * is grandly mouth-filling and 
pictorial, but * sea' is ignoble, *air' at least 
questionable, *sky' weak and thin. The 
clipped dissyllable * heaven' is decidedly poor. 
'Firmament,' however, is magnificent, and 
'Paradise' fine. 'Earth,' 'sun,' 'stars' 
are three low plebeian symbols for the total 
splendors of the visible world. Turn to the 
words describing man's own person. His im- 
perial majesty has certainly been modest. 
' Man ' is a pretty poor sound to attach to the 
prince of creation. ' Face ! ' what a word is 
that to emblem forth the great soul's apparent 
seat ! ' Eyes,' ' nose,' ' mouth,' ' arms." 
'legs,' — could there be a worse commodity of 
vile names? Then take the inward attributes 
of our human state : ' Brain ' is bad ; ' soul ' 
only so-so; 'heart ' indifferent. Truly, as far 
as words go, man has a poor chance of figuring 
in any prose writers golden stvle. Send him 
abroad, like Adam, to view and name his pos- 
sessions ! It is to be hoped that Adam had bet- 
ter taste than to call his cave a 'house.' 
' Mansion ' or ' palace ' might do. ' Garden,' 
' valley,' ' forest ' are good ; but ' farm,' ' plain,' 
'tree,' 'sheep,' 'road,' 'horse,' 'cow,' 'bird,' 
'bee,' and a myriad more, are very middling at 
least. ' Metropolis ' is fine, and gave Keats a 
glittering line, — ' Upon the gold clouds metro-

[Sept. 16, 



politan/ but *city' is affected, and 'town' — 
let us pronounce it ' taown ' at once and be done 
with it. 

Then take our pronouns, ' I,' ' he,' ' she,' 
*it,' 'who,' 'whom,' 'you,' 'they,' — why, it 
is like the neighing of horses or the hoot- 
ing of owls! On the whole, then, we have 
not made a success of the names we most use. 
' Birth ' is not a pretty word, and ' life ' and 
' death ' hiss at each other like angry geese. 
I do not want to fly in the face of my mother 
language, but as a fellow-sufferer with Mr. 
Pater and Mr. Alden I ask how I am going to 
make style out of words like those ? 

Turn to the verbs. 'To be,' 'do,' 'act,' 
' make,' ' go,' ' come,' have a certain brevity 
of use and command, but they are dull and 
creeping enough. The fact that we have so 
often to prefix the sign of the infinitive to our 
verbs is another offense of the language. It has 
the look of a consumptive policeman conveying 
a squat tramp to the station-house. ' To love ' 
has a cooing sound, and 'to desire' is noble. 
But for the most part the verbs denoting the 
usual occupations of life are vulgar in the ex- 
treme. ' To buy,' ' sell,' ' eat,' ' fight,' ' run,' 
'talk/ 'sleep,' 'lose,' 'gain,' — these and in- 
numerable others have countenances of no mark 
or likelihood. Contemplating them, one feels a 
glow of admiration for Walt Whitman when his 
picturesque genius soars to the heights of 'ab- 
squatulate ' or ' skedaddle.' It is to the adjec- 
tives that we must mainly look for what of 
physical comeliness our speech affords. Many of 
them are veritable patricians, and show like Al- 
cibiades or Cosmo de Medici amid the vulgar 
rabble of our nouns and verbs. 'August,' 
'splendid,' 'noble,' 'gorgeous,' 'magnificent,' 
' graceful,' ' beautiful/ ' indomitable,' — such 
words adorn the pages of prose or verse, — 

' Pride In each port, defiance in each eye, 
I see these lords of human speech pass by.' 

And here, because I am acting as the Devil's 
Advocate of words, I would note another fact 
which tells against my side: 'Beauteous is a 
vile word,' says Polonius. It is so ! But why ? 
I cannot tell. There must be something in its 
physiognomy which does not suit our minds. 

On the whole, then, owing partly to the enor- 
mous proportion of monosyllables, partly to the 
prevalence of sibilant and dental sounds, the 
words of the English language are overwhelm- 
ingly ugly and unmusical. A word of two or 
more syllables may be a melody, or at least a 
cadence; a word of one syllable is merely a 
noise. The 'caw-caw-caw' of the crow or the 
' tweet-tweet-tweet ' of the sparrow are not mu- 
sical — the trills and arias of the catbird or 
nightingale are. Words that sing themselves 
are surely more advantageous to the builder of 



sentences than words that halt and grunt and 
groan. The writer of English has to labor with 
his raw recruits of vocables, to make them 
stand at attention or walk in file; when he 
wants them to give voice together, he finds 
that they are dumb or hoarse or hissing. All 
the more honor to him if he succeeds! Ac- 
cording to those who find in mere words the 
secret of style, English literature should be very 
nearly styleless. But, on the contrary, beyond 
all other literatures it is drenched and irradi- 
ated and alive with style. Even its bad styles — 
those of Johnson or Carlyle, for example, — 
are not like the bad styles of other literatures 

— merely ponderous or commonplace. They are 
striking, original, full of interest. To sum up, 
then: the English language is preeminently a 
language of ugly and discordant words; the 
English literature is preeminently a literature 
of style — of glowing and appropriate expres- 
sion; therefore words in themselves have very 
little to do with the evolution of style. 

I have said that the idea of style is usually 
associated with prose; and also that there are 
as many styles as writers. But prose style in 
English falls into three great species, to one or 
the other of which most pieces of composition 
may be referred. The first of these species is 
the prose which M. Jourdain was delighted to 
find that he talked. It is the plain, straight- 
forward, unadorned language of life. But we 
must beware of thinking that this style, as it 
exists in the pages of great writers, is without 
art. There is perhaps as much art in the plain- 
ness of Swift, the naturalness of Defoe, the sim- 
plicity of Bunyan, as in the ordered and far- 
wheeling sentences of Milton or Burke. Let 
anyone try to do a piece of work like Franklin's 
autobiography, and he will discover the diffi- 
culty of the method. Always the necessary in- 
strument of men of action, and for direct nar- 
ratives of real experiences, this style has been 
revived in recent years for the use of fiction, 
and in fact for many other purposes. Much of 
Poe's and Stevenson's work was done in it. 
though at their best they put off corduroy and 
donned silks and satins and velvets. The style 
is so simple and wholesome and good that there 
is little more to be said about it, except that 
self-consciousness is fatal to it; fine writing, 
unless very skillfully concealed, its ruin. 

The second prose species in English is the 
ornate, elaborated, monumental, periodic style 

— the so-called prose poetry. De Quincey, de- 
fending this his favorite style, somewhere asks 
what a writer of the calibre of Swift would 
have done if set such a theme as Belshazzar's 
feast and told to develop all the implications 
and consequences of the story. Probably Swift 
would have made something awful of the mat-

ter. But it may be doubted whether the few 
strong words which the Bible devotes to the in- 
cident are not more impressive than any fan- 
tasia which Jeremy Taylor or Milton or De 
Quincey himself could have written around it. 
Unquestionably, the lofty prose flights of these 
writers are superb, but there is a touch of fal- 
setto in them. They try to give the sensuous 
effect of verse without verse's sensuous appar- 
atus of rhythm and rhyme, without its allowed 
elisions and inversions which tend to concentra- 
tion and concreteness. And, in the second 
place, they are an imitation of the poorest kind 
of poetry — descriptive poetry. Great poetry 
does not linger and loiter; it strides on from 
action to action, from thought to thought, and 
gives its descriptions very largely by means of 
hints and flashes and implications. In the set 
pieces of Ruskin and De Quincey and Jeremy 
Taylor, we cannot see the forest for the trees. 
They set out to describe some single matter, — 
a lark rising in the air, Joan lyArc on her 
scaffold, a lonely tower fronting the sea; but 
the subject bourgeons and eflBoresces in their 
hands; troops and battalions of ideas and im- 
ages come to illustrate or elaborate it. These 
end by hiding the central theme. By the time 
we hare got to the middle of the description we 
have forgotten the beginning; and when we are 
done we do not know whether we are standing 
on our head or our heels. I do not in the least 
deny that such work is valuable and wonderful. 
But it is not quite the real thing either of 
poetry or prose. 

But there is a perfect, crowning, golden style 
in English prose. It is a style whose colloquial 
ease is not the home-bred rusticity of our first 
species, whose sparkling polish is not the im- 
pasto brilliancy of our second. It is simple 
from richness, glowing from within. It is keen 
and flexible and glittering, like a Damascus 
blade. It is terse. It does not tire. It does 
not over-dwell. The supreme master of this 
prose is Shakespeare; his co-rival in art, 
though, alas, not in matter, is Congreve. Gold- 
smith reigns on a little lower level; and there 
is no fourth to rank with them. Their prose 
gives the essence of character in immortal 
words. We recognize it as our real inheritance 
of speech, which we all ought to share, but 
which we have somehow been cut out of. No 
girl ever said like Rosalind, ' A star danced, and 
under that I was bom ;' but the phrase gives ns 
at once a picture of the heroine and a precious 
pearl of language to put away among our verbal 
treasures. No fine lady ever uttered such a 
speech as this of Millamant's : ' What is a lover 
that it can give? One makes lovers as fast as 
one pleases, and they live as long as one 
pleases, and when one pleases they die; and 



then, if one pleases, one makes some more.' 
All the adorable coquetry of the women is in 
those words, and they are, besides, a set of 
cadences which affect the literary student with 
delight and despair. No wandering bear- 
leader ever put forth a claim to be a gentleman 
in the words of Tony Lumpkins's boon com- 
panion, * Tho'd I be obligated to dance a bear, 
my bear only dances to the genteelest of tunes, 
" Water Parted " or the Minuet in Ariadne.* 
The clown rises before us in this sentence, which 
must tickle the fancy forever. 

Sheridan has a skyrocket imitation of this 
style. Hazlitt and Charles Lamb, as a reward 
for their love of it, sometimes attain to its pure 
perfections. Thackeray struggled to achieve it 
all his life; but his success is at best quite ques- 
tionable. Once, in a dispute with Tennyson, he 
asserted his ability to equal Catullus. He re- 
canted this opinion the next morning, in a note 
of becoming modesty; and probably he has by 
this time recanted the opinion which he held 
longer and more seriously, that he could write 
better than Congreve. Strange as it may seem, 
Dickens is really the more consummate mas- 
ter of this style. In the scenes where the Wel- 
lers appear, in those between Dick Swiveller 
and the Marchioness, above all in those which 
have to do with Sairey Gamp, he too gives ns 
the essence of character in immortal words. 
Mrs. Gamp's ' Put the bottle on the chiml^'- 
piece so I may wet my lips with it if I be so 
dispoged ;' the Marchioness's pathetic refference 
to the imagination which was required to sea- 
son the lemon-peel punch ; Sam Weller's philos- 
ophy of love-letters; the elder Weller's descrip- 
tion of Mr. Stiggins, — these, and a hundred 
other passages, place Dickens not much below 
the i^erfect three. 

Cardinal Newman and Matthew Arnold are 
perhaps the best modem masters of this style 
in serious matters. And the famous scene 
where Arminius investigates ilr. Bottle's mind, 
qua mind, shows in Arnold the creating flash. 
This species of prose, informal, easy as an old 
shoe, is, as it were, made for letter-writing ; and 
as a consequence the great English letter-writ- 
ers. Gray, Cowper, Keats, FitzGerald, are 
among its best exponents. Keats's prose, in- 
deed, is almost pure Shakespeare. Among 
Americans, Poe has the glitter though hardly 
the ease of the style, Lowell its unction, and 
Emerson its inward irradiation. 

There is one kind of prose style which, I 
think, has hardly been naturalized in English. 
It is the style of Thucydides and Tacitus — the 
style, that is, of one who says everything almost 
without words. Landor essayed to write it ; but 
Junius, perhaps, alone succeeded.

G0M3IUNICA TIONS. 



'THE SHADE OF THE BALKANS.' 
(To the Editor of The Diai,.) 

Since the reviewer of 'The Shade of the Bal- 
kans,' in your issue of August 1, has made im- 
proper use of a private letter, I am sure you will 
allow me to correct him in a public letter. 
It happens that in 'The Shade of the Bal- 
kans' (which is a collection of Bulgarian 
folk-songs, etc., and related essays, for which 
Pencho Slaveikoff, Dr. E. J. Dillon and myself are 
responsible) we say we do not believe that 'The 
Bard of the Dimbovitza ' is, as it pretends to be, a 
collection of Roumanian folk-songs, but that it 
has been manufactured (and very well) by Car- 
men Sylva, Miss Helene Vacaresco, and Miss 
Alma Strettell. The f olk-lorists have always class- 
ed this book with Ossian ; and their reasons for so 
doing have been set forth in our volume for the 
benefit of the general reader. Our object was not, 
as your reviewer suggests, to satisfy our superflu- 
ous malice; there is in Slaveikoff 's essay a com- 
plete examination of Bulgarian Popular Literature, 
its origin , its heroes, its methods, its villains, and 
not the least interesting part is concerned with 
Stephen Verkovich, who forged the celebrated 
'Veda Slovena,' with Wenceslaus Hanka who 
'discovered' his own poems in the vault of the 
church-tower of Koniginhof, and so forth. The 
. value of his work would therefore have been less 
if nothing had been said about 'The Bard of the 
Dimbovitza,' since the Rouman's culture has been, 
from* the Middle Ages imtil recent times, so 
closely interwoven with the Bulgar's (I need only 
refer to Dr. Ivan Shishmanoff's: well-known 
pamphlet, 'Der Lenorenstoff in der Bulgarischen 
Volkspoesie, ' wherein the prevalence and varia- 
tions of this one song throughout the Balkans are 
discussed) that such a collection of folk-songs as 
Miss V.'s cannot exist or have existed. 

I shall not troubl.e to repeat the scientific rea- 
sons (as, for example, that in the present condi- 
tiop of the Roumanian tongue even Emenesco, the 
best of their modem poets cannot give utterance 
to such songs as Miss V. has collected from the 
lips of an old gardener, a nurse, etc., so that these 
gifted retainers presumably speak French, in 
which language the songs were first published). 
But let me say that Teodorescu, the greatest of 
Roumanian folk-lorists, has never been able to 
find any songs like these; no more have any othei 
'learned and patient folk-lore searchers,' as Miss 
V. herself admits in the dedication of a later 
volume. On the contrary, the wise men of 
Bucharest have ridiculed the book's pretensions; 
and for this Miss V. calls them unpatriotic! 

One cannot hope that every man who writes 
reviews of folk-song books should be a folk-lorist; 
but I confess that it is disheartening when the 
proofs (which we thought, it worth while putting 
for the general reader's sake, and which all f olk- 
lorists already knew) are utterly ignored, and 
your reviewer proceeds to say, 'There can, of 
eoui-se, be no doubt as to the authenticity of the 



songs. ... It is pi-eposterous that a reigning 
Queen,' etc., etc. . . . 'Helene Vacaresco is a 
maid of honor to this Queen.' Allow me to 
repeat the words of Moliere : ' On peut etre hon- 
nete homme et faire mal des vers.' 

Your reviewer does not know how these songa 
were made, and I cannot enlighten him, as I am 
far from being in Miss V.'s secrets; but, judging 
from a later volume which has her name alone 
upon the title-page, I shall say that the quality 
which gives them value— their aesthetic beauty — 
is owing to the genius, not altogether unknown, of 
Miss Alma Strettell. 

My private letter to your reviewer was written 
on account of one he sent to Slaveikoff. When I 
met S. last spring in Paris, he gave me the letter, 
which was a request for further information as to 
Miss V. [He wrote likewise to that lady asking 
her to tell him whether the songs are authentic ! 
May I comment upon this by quoting your re- 
viewer on some other lines which, says he, 'are 
touching in their sweet simplicity'?] S.'s health 
being bad, his sister had replied to the letter, and 
at his suggestion I sent a supplementary reply. It 
is the treatment of this reply which I consider 
grossly unfair. 

In the first place, I informed the inquirer that 
the ienunciation of Miss V. has for the sake of 
simplicity been added to S.'s essay, but that as a 
matter of fact I had compiled it from the words 
of S. and of others. 'Such a procedure,' says 
your reviewer, 'casts suspicion upon the whole 
book.' How ludicrous! If an engine is being 
cleaned by Samuel Smith, the driver, and his 
three competent assistants, we may say, for the 
sake of simplicity, that the engine is being cleaned 
by Samuel. Why need I add in parenthesis that 
this proof came from Dr. Dillon, or that another 
one was contributed by Mr. Misu, the Roumanian 
agent and philologist in Sofia, or that others again 
were provided by Professor Dr. Gaster, the 
famous Roumanian scholar? They all agreed 
with each other, S. agi-eed with all of them, and 
as moot of the proofs did not originate with 
them but with him it is not very reprehensible, I 
think, if all of them are grouped under his name. 
Against these experts, by the way, your reviewer 
brings up two French gentlemen who, he sajrs, 
champion Miss V., namely : M. Gaston Paris and 
M. Andre Bellessort. He says the former is one 
of the greatest French authorities on the subject. 
That, permit me to remark, is exceedingly faint 
praise. With M. Bellessort I am unacquainted, 
but I am sorry that his two years' study and 
travel in Roumania have not brought him nearer 
to Teodorescu, Emenesco, Dr. Gaster, and others 
who have studied Roumania for a lifetime. 

In the second place, I informed your reviewer 
that in the London 'Bookman' for April I had 
reviewed Miss V.'s later book, in a signed article. 
He blames me, apparently', for writing it with sar- 
casm. Heavens ! must all reviews be written with 
streaming eyes? He blames me for writing it at 
all. Surely it is better that reviews should be 
written by those who are in some degree ac- 
quainted with the subject than by those who are

obliged to write privately to the authors for infor-

word for word, from the books themselves. He 
blames me for saying that a part of our book is

The Bath Club, London, Aug. 20, 1905 

[Mr. Bernard's letter is so immoderate, so 
full of inaccuracies, exaggerations, and mis- 
statements, that space will not allow a discus- 
sion of it at length. 

In the first place the reviewer cannot plead 
guilty to Mr. Bernard's charge of having made 
improper use of a private letter. Struck by 
M!r. SlaveikofFs bitter denunciation of Miss 
Vacaresco's ' The Bard of the Dimbovitza ', in- 
volying the Queen of Roumania, and feeling 
the injustice in the manner of the attack, the 
reviewer wrote to him stating that he was re- 
viewing her later book and his own, and asking 
hie opinion of ^Songs of the Valiant Voivode ' 
(not information about the author, as Mr. Ber- 
nard erroneously says). According to Mr. 
Bernard's admission, his unsolicited letter to 
the reviewer was written at the request of Mr. 
Slaveikoff, who knew that his bitterness had 
attracted unfavorable comment. Under these 
circumstances, the reviewer felt justified in 
making two quotations from this letter; one, in 
justice to Mr. Slaveikoff, to show that he was 
not the author of all the denunciation put into 
his essay ; and a second quotation, suggested by 
regret that the reviewer could not have the 
pious sensation experienced by the man who 
felt that ' he might as well review the Bible ' 
as the book sent forth by Mr. Bernard. 

The reviewer has indeed had the privilege of 
exchanging several letters with Miss Vacaresco. 
When Mr. Bernard conjectures that the re- 
viewer wrote to this lady asking her to tell him 
whether the songs are authentic, he is evident- 
ly thinking of a letter that he himself wrote 
to her inquiring about the authenticity of those 
in a former book, during the preparation of his 
own work. The reply was probably not satis- 
factory to the gentleman, for he confesses, 'I 
am far from being in Miss Y.'s secrets.' These 
things are indeed 'touching in their sweet 
simplicity '. 

Eulosrv from M. Andre Bellessort, M. Gas- 
ton Paris, and the French Academy is, in Mr. 
Bernard's opinion, exceedingly faint praise. It 
is a pity, then, that he condescends to quote 
from the language represented by them. 

Is it not possible that the judgment of one 
of the Roumanians mentioned has been preju- 
diced by his exile? 

It appears that Mr. Bernard has not read 



the offending review carefully. Speaking of 
the reference to his notice of ' Songs of the 
VaKant Voivode ', he says, * He blames me for 
writing it at all.' Nothing of the kind was 
said in the review. In two other places he mis- 
quotes it, and in his excitement he exclaims, 
* Heavens ! must all reviews be written with 
streaming eyes?' Certainly not; read that of 
'The Shade of the Balkans.' 

In spite of Mr. Bernard's attempted defense 
and the puffing of the engine, the method of 
putting into Mr. Slaveikoff's signed essay, even 
*for the sake of simplicity,' statements com- 
piled from others, can hardly be approved. 

As said in the review, Mr. Bernard's book 
contains much of interest; but the reviewer 
was constrained to deplore the newspaper 
style, the immoderate tone, the prejudice, and 
the undignified attack upon the Queen of Rou- 
mania and Miss Vacaresco; and his plea was 
for respectful treatment of these authors. He is 
not yet prepared to question their veracity. —

'PAUL JONES AS A HERO IN FICTION.' 
(To the Editor of The Diai») 
Under the above title, The Dial of August 16 
publishes a conmiunication, as interesting as it is 
timely, from Mrs. Annie Russell Marble, in which 
attention is called to James Fenimore Cooper's 
characterization, in 'The Pilot,' of Paul Jones; 
and passages from the novel are quoted, 
apparently to justify the rehabilitation of Jones's 
character that is now being somewhat noisily ad- 
vanced in the country of his adoption. 

It seems to me to be only fair to the novelist 
that the following sentences, from page 288 of 
Professor Lounsbury's life of Cooper in the 
'American Men of Letters' series, should also be 
printed: 'He [Cooper] was in later years dis- 
satisfied with himself, because in his novel of * The 
Pilot' he had put the character of Jones too high. 
He thought that the hero had been credited in 
that work with loftier motives than those by 
which he was actually animated.'

A Frenchman's Hhapsody on America.* 

After Pastor Wagner and his strenuous 
preaching of the simple life, comes the Abbe 
Klein with his simple account of the strenuous 
life as seen by him in this country and Canada 
during the late summer and autumn of 1903. 
^ Simple ' need not here be construed to the 
good priest's disadvantage; rather let it be in- 
terpreted to mean that there is something al- 
most touchingly naive and joyous, unrestrained 
and enthusiastic, about his pleasant description 
of his vacation frolic in the land of the free 
and the home of the- brave, — or, to quote his 
somewhat fervid language, ' this great and glo- 
rious land of liberty and faith and tolerance, tho 
place of all places where, in times of moral ex- 
haustion, men may hope to refresh their souls 
as they renew their physical health in the air 
of the mountains or the sea/ Like M. Wag- 
ner, our author is a fervent admirer of Presi- 
dent Eoosevelt, whom he frequently quotes, and 
to whom he dedicates his book by permission. 

The genial Abbe saw much to admire and lit- 
tle to condemn in our country and its institu- 
tions. He glows and exuberates on the sub- 
ject of our bigness, our material prosperity, and 
our rapid growth. So very friendly and admir- 
ing a visitor to our shores must not be harshly 
dealt with for such inaccuracies (and they 
are not few) as have crept into his gorgeously 
tinted picture of our country. He means well, 
and is far more likely to err in our favor, and 
especially in favor of those of us who are 
his co-religionists, than the contrary. Let 
not the reader be disconcerted by an occasional 
wrong date, as 1633 for Boston*s settlement, 
1773 for the Boston Massacre (perhaps con- 
founded with the Tea-Party of that year), 
and 1803 for the building of Fort Dearborn. 
The author amuses us by checking himself 
in mid-career to say, * I am afraid of fall- 
ing into the American abuse of superlatives, 
but truly' — and the stream of eulogy flows 
on again unrestrained. Even those chill horrors 
in marble and granite, our cemeteries, are 
included in the general panegyric, because 
in the Frenchman's eyes tiiey are so cheer- 
ful in appearance, so well cared for, and 
are, as he expresses it, ' at once the abode of the 
dead and a place of recreation for the living.' 
* The cult of the departed,' he adds, ' is as fer- 
vent in America as in Paris ; the graves are as 
well kept, but they do not offer the same aspect 
of mourning. Among this people, optimistic by

nature, and confiding in God, death itself loses 
its desolation.' For that monstrous architec- 
tural jumble, the capitol at Albany, as for 
American architecture in general, the writer 
has notliing but praise. It must be said, how- 
ever, that he was disappointed in his hope of 
viewing the Albany wonder in person, a disap- 
pointment due to the route chosen from New 
York to Montreal, the journey being made by 
railway via Springfield and Boston instead of 
up the Hudson. *To miss the Hudson was a 
mistake, perhaps,' he admits ; * but to miss Bos- 
ton would have been a crime.' Cultured Boston 
is described, or partly described — for he has 
considerable to say about it — in words that 
unmistakably betray the writer's nationality. 

' As Boston passes for the most intellectual city 
of the United States, so too it is commonly sup- 
posed to be the one most thoroughly permeated 
with French culture. Its era of prosperity dates 
back to the time when French manners and French 
literature set the fashion for the world. Fidelity 
to its own traditions, therefore, keeps Boston 
faithful to tliose of France. It follows our books 
and periodicals with close attention, and cultivates 
the studj' of our language so assiduously that the 
French lecturer, summoned yearly to Harvard by 
the terms of a special foundation, always finds a 
large and appreciative audience ready to welcome 
him.' 

Another regret caused by the choice of the 
New England route to Montreal was that of 
missing the Catholic Summer School at I^ake 
Champlain. ' However,' concludes the Abbe, ' to 
become well acquainted with the six or seven 
hundred Catholics at the Summer School would 
require at least a fortnight, and so bng a stay 
was simply impossible.' The genial visitor's 
capacity for making acquaintance appears to be 
something extraordinary. 

Much space is, naturally enough, devoted to 
the Catholic church and to Catholic religious 
houses and schools in the United States and 
Canada, and the Protestant reader will learn 
some new things in the course of the book — 
perhaps even a few things that are not so. But 
never mind; the Abbe is not compiling a dic- 
tionary of statistics. Had he been, he probably 
would have thought twice before assigning so 
many of his co-religionists to some of our cities. 
The Chicago Catholics, for example, he puts 
at one million, out of a total population which 
he makes largely in excess of census returns. 
The exemplary moralitj'', too, that he delights to 
attribute to the restraining influence of the con- 
fessional might not be borne witness to by police 
court records. 

Although the phrase 'vacation frolic' was, 
perhaps inadvisedly, used to characterize the 
author's American tour, it must not be thought 
that he came among us mainly for idle amuse- 
ment. As already indicated, serious study of 
religious and educational systems claimed much 



1906.] 



THE DTATi 



16S 



of his time. Here are a few sensible words 
prompted by a visit to the Catholic miiversity 
at Notre Dame, Indiana : 

* It requires only a brief examination of the 
discipline of Notre Dame to bring out an essential 
distinction which exists between English and 
American education on the one hand, and French 
education on the other; it is that the former al- 
lows more freedom to collegians and less to ad- 
vanced students than we do. Certainly it is not 
the least of the inconveniences of our system that 
up to a boy's eighteenth year we deprive him of 
ail initiative, and then of a sudden fling him into 
absolute independence. There is not one boy in 
our secondary schools who would not feel like 
an escaped prisoner if he were to enter Eton, or 
an American college, or the similar school in 
France, the Ecole des Boches. On the other hand, 
there is not a young man among our advanced 
students who would not feel disgraced if he were 
asked to submit to the discipline that governs 
the graduates of Oxford, Harvard, or Notre Dame. 
Undoubtedly surveillance ought to be proportioned 
to the age of the student, but it is unwise to 
make all surveillance odious from the very begin- 
ning by irritating restraints, and then when a 
boy's dangers are greatest to leave him abso- 
lutely to his own devices.' 

Whenever our cheerful traveller meets a dis- 
contented foreign-bom American, he is tempted 
to ask, ' Why, then, don't you go back again to 
the old countr}' ? ' Thus a conversation about 
Chicago with a citizen of German birth leads to 
a similar silent query on the part of the French- 
man, whom we will leave to relate the incident 
in his own words, 

' We are on an " accommodation " train; at 
every stop new passengers enter, and soon all the 
seats are taken. I surrender mine to a woman, 
and, seeking a place on the platform, am soon 
deep in conversation with a Chicago tradesman. 
He is a German, native of Cologne. About 1880 
he came to America, and has succeeded so well 
in business here that he has no desire to leave. 
That does not hinder him, however, from speaking 
very severely of the city of his adoption. " Chi- 
cago," he said, " has magnificent parks, boule- 
vards, and residences; but the greater part of it 
is dirty to a disgusting degree. One would think 
that with the twenty millions of dollars that we 
pay in taxes every year, the city would be able 
to present a clean and respectable appearance; but 
three-fourths of the money goes right into the 
pockets of the unscrupulous politicians who are 
keeping a tight hold on the city government. But 
of course they have to satisfy their followers; 
and how else can they be reimbursed for their 
heavy election expenses? Democrats or Eepubli- 
cans, one lot is as bad as the other; it is not 
worth while to turn the rascals out — their suc- 
cessors would be worse. In this country, everyone 
bends the knee in worship of the Almighty Dol- 
lar." And in fact, this severe critic seems as 
devout a worshipper as the rest; if the country 
is so disagreeable to him, why, except for his 
pecuniary interests, doesn't he quit for good? 
Besides, it is easy enough to see that a city 
which has increased a million inhabitants in the 
last two decades can hardly have everything in 
apple-pie order; no wonder certain streets are still 
unswept, unmacadamized, unpaved. If you add 



to the tirade of my German friend all that I had 
heard of " the city of pork- packers " in Europe 
and - Canada, you will understand that I entered 
it without much prepossession in its favor. Some 
good people, indeed, had whispered into my ear 
that no one who had the faintest love of beauty 
or retained more than a shred of moral sense 
would willingly set foot on the streets of Chicago.' 

Nevertheless, praise is not wanting even for 
Chicago, whose 'enchanting parks' and fine 
boulevards especially please the visitor. * What 
traveller,' he asks, ' will brave all prejudice, 
and be the first to tell the world that there are 
very few cities uniting as much loveliness in 
their parks, their avenues, and their boulevards, 
as this prosaic city of Chicago ? I would be the 
second to such a one; and I would add that I 
have hardly seen anywhere else so many people 
prajing in the churches, or visiting the mu- 
seums and galleries, or reading in the libraries.' 
The ' handsome university to which Mr. Rocke- 
fellers millions have piped the Pierian springs ' 
receives mention, but, being under Protestant 
auspices, it fails to attract much of the good 
priesf s attention. Prom Chicago the traveller 
proceeded to Peoria, of whose distinguished 
Bishop he has many good things to say, as wit- 
ness the following: 

* Not that Bishop Spalding tries to impress one 
by any sort of outward show. American bishops 
are noted for their aimplieity; and he is the 
simplest of them all. Like all truly superior 
minds, he respects in each the natural dignity of 
man, and treats everyone as his equaL I do not 
think he speaks in any other way to his friend 
President Roosevelt than he would to the young- 
eat curate in his cathedral. It matters not where 
or before whom he may be, he is always simply 
himself, without precaution or reserve. If one 
inspires confidence in him, he says so, and there- 
after it may be relied upon. In the contrary case, 
his manner is equally candid. I do not faiow, — 
or, rather I do know, but do not care to say, — 
who it was that one day asked his cooperation 
in a certain enterprise, and upon being refused 
point-blank, demanded an explanation. " Because 
I have no confidence in you," answered Bishop 
Spalding, with the most naturail tone in the world.' 

Our strenuous President the author considers 
one of the two most interesting men he has 
ever met, Cardinal Lavigerie being the other. 
Two paragraphs from the chapter devoted 
chiefly to Mr. Boosevelt are selected for quota- 
tion. 

* The man of the Strenuous Life is indeed 
before us. My seat is quite close to his. I miss 
no movement of his countenance or of his entire 
body, no inflection of his earnest and resonant 
voice. A magnetic current radiates from his whole 
being and affects everyone about him. I under- 
stand what was meant by a writer in one of 
the American reviews, who compared him to a 
dynamo, and said, " He seems to explode his 
words." He is of medium height, but robust and 
muscular. His round and somewhat full face, his 
fine light mustache, his fresh, animated com- 
plexion, his hair in its original abundance, his 
vivacity of manner, give him, notwithstanding his

five-and-forty years, a youthful appearance which 
the cartoonists do ijot neglect. To this energetic, 
almost restless, make-up, a pair of blue eyes add 
that attribute, without which all the rest were 
nothing, which is called charm.' 

' I was not, I believe,^ playing the flatterer, in 
telling the President that France takes a great 
interest in him and his ideas. He then spoke 
of his personal sympathy with our nation. He 
mentioned the French descent of Mrs. Roosevelt, — 
formerly Miss Edith Kermit Carow; and he added, 
with evidently sincere satisfaction, that he him- 
self had French blood in his veins. That was 
why, he continued, he had given the unusual name 
of Quentin to the youngest of his four boys. As 
everybody knows, he belongs to an old Dutch 
family that settled in New York in its early 
period, and has distinguished itself continuously 
in commerce and public affairs. Something less 
generally known, though worthy of observation for 
the light it throws on his many-sided character, 
is that several of his ancestors married daughters 
of French Huguenots; that his paternal grand- 
mother was Irish; and that his mother, a Bullock 
of Georgia, was of Scotch and French descent. 
So there is a good dose of the Celt in this New 
York Dutchman. But we must remember that 
above all there are two centuries and a half of 
American education,' 

The Abbe is a man of fine culture, and a 
wide-awake if not always sufficiently skeptical 
observer. Best of all, his whole book breathes 
a freshness and a joy "of living that, quite apart 
from its subject-matter, are decidedly engaging ; 
and the amiable determination to be pleased 
with everything and everybody American cannot 
but win the author many friends among the 
readers of his American edition. The already 
established popularity of the work in France is 
indicated by the fact that it passed into a 7th 
edition a few months after its publication, 
and it has received from the French Academy 
the Montyon prize of a thousand francs. The 
good literary style of the English version, made 
by the Abbe himself, and the highly entertain- 
ing character of the narrative, will no doubt 
make it a favorite in this country also.

The Insect Age.* 



In his new book on ' American Insects ' Pro- 
fessor Kellogg remarks that 'if man were not 
the dominant animal in the world, this would 
be the Age of Insects.' But Forel, the well- 
known Swiss authority on ants, has raised the 
question whether, after all, these insects do not 
in reality possess the earth. I look out of my 
v?indow on a vacant lot, covered with rocks and 
wild plants. It is said to ' belong ^ to Mr. So- 
and-So; but I have never seen him there: 
whereas it is, I know, peopled in every quarter, 
inside and out, so to speak, by ants. If pos-

session is nine-tenths of the law, they certainly 
have the better of it. 

So, perhaps, this is the Age of Insects, and 
we are of secondary importance. Without press- 
ing the point — for man's egotism is invulner- 
able — we must at least admit that the study 
of insects is worth while. As I write. New 
Orleans is suffering fearful penalties for her 
neglect to consider the mosquito and his deadly 
ways; and it is more than probable that flies 
carried death, in the form of typhoid germs, 
to many of our brave boys in the Spanish war. 
It has ceased to be merely a question of loss 
of property; our very lives are in danger be- 
cause of certain insects. On the other hand, 
from their very numbers and variety, insects 
afford splendid material for the investigation of 
many scientific problems; while, for the same 
reasons, they enable even the beginner to make 
discoveries, — real additions to scientific knowl- 
edge. It is not surprising, therefore, that the 
study of insects is becoming increasingly pop- 
ular, and that publishers find it worth their 
while to bring out large tomes upon the subject. 

Professor Kellogg's book is certain to be 
widely useful. In its style, it reminds me 
somewhat of Figuier's ' Insect World,' an ad- 
mirable French book which was translated into 
English, and was one of the chief joys of my 
boyhood. Readable and profusely illustrated, 
it gives a great amount of information about 
the insects of this country, in such a manner 
that it is available to any intelligent person. 
Dr. D. Sharp's volumes in the ' Cambridge 
Natural History' still hold the field for gen- 
eral entomology, and are not likely to be super- 
seded, unless by a larger work which their 
learned author has in preparation. Dr. How- 
ard's ' Insect Book' has a unique value for its 
numerous illustrations, and especially the ex- 
cellent life-histories. Other works are neces- 
sary for particular purposes ; but if I were asked 
to name a single work for a beginner, who at 
the same time meant business, I should not hes- 
itate to recommend this new product of Stan- 
ford University. 

It is not necessary to give any detailed ac- 
count of the work. In addition to the chapters 
describing the different kinds of insects, there 
are special sections on structure and physiol- 
og}', development and transformations, insects 
and flowers, colors and color-patterns, insects 
and disease, and collecting and rearing insects. 
In a new edition, I should like to see a chap- 
ter on the geographical distribution of insects, 
if that would not make the book too large. The 
account of the beetles seems too short; a spe- 
cial work on North American beetles is at pres- 
ent a great desideratum. 

In a work of this sort there are always some

things to criticise adversely. No living ento- 
mologist knows all groups of insects well, and 
it would probably be better if the several chap- 
ters of any general work were either written or 
revised by specialists. With all its merits, Pro- 
fessor Kellogg's book is a little too much of a 
compilation to be ideally satisfactory; and the 
numerous figures without specific names suggest 
the lack of help which might surely have been 
obtained for the asking. The nomenclature 
given is in some cases unsatisfactory, and in 
one or two instances the same insect is called 
by different names in different parts of the 
book. Misprints are not very uncommon, but 
of other errors I have found few. On plate 
ix, figure 28 is not a 'skipper' butterfly, and 
its scientific name is not Archonias lyceas, but 
]^eophasia terlootii. Plate ii., fig. 12, named 
Meloe, appears to be Megetra vittata. Some of 
the borrowed figures are very poor, but most 
of the illustrations are good.

New Views of the Great Spaxish 
Akmada.* 



Volume III. of the ' Cambridge Modem His- 
tory ' series is entitled ' The Wars of Eeligion,' 
a title sufficiently indicating the nature of its 
contents, and covers the general field of Euro- 
pean history from 1530 to 1625. The twenty- 
two chapters are divided among sixteen authors, 
of whom four at least are widely and favorably 
known as specialists in the fields of which they 
write. These are Mr. B. Nisbet Bain on Po- 
land, Mr. E. Armstrong on Tuscany and Savoy, 
Mr. Martin Hume in two chapters on Philip 
II. and Philip III. of Spain, and Mr. S. K. 
Gardiner (whose recent death has caused a dis- 
tinct loss to the historical world) on England 
in the time of James I. The chapters by these 
authors are all excellent examples of the spec- 
ialist's art, and yet are well suited to the gen- 
eral survey that the work itself is attempting 
to give. The usual selected bibliographies ac- 
company the volume ; while in their preface the 
editors announce that upon the completion of 
the twelve volumes originally planned two sup- 
plementary volumes will appear, one containing 
maps of the various countries in the periods 
treated, and one supplying a general index to 
the entire work, together with some compre- 
hensive genealogical tables. 

It is becoming more and more evident, with 
the appearance of each volume, that this huge 
production can never serve as a popular his- 
tory, nor even as an instructive one; since the

distinctions made, and the emphasis placed on 
comparatively minor incidents, are such as the 
general reader cannot appreciate and which 
therefore merely weary him. The work is ser- 
viceable for reference purposes, but is especially 
of value to the student of history, offering him 
specialist knowledge, and at the same time giv- 
ing him suggestions for his own work. An 
adequate review of the volume should there- 
fore be directed to the needs of the historical 
student, and should deal explicitly with each 
contribution; but our present limits confine ai>- 
tention to but one of the many interesting 
chapters, that by Mr. J. K. Laughton on * The 
Elizabethan Naval War with Spain.* 

Mr. Laughton's desire for accuracy removes 
all the glamour of the epoch. Hawkins, Drake, 
and even Sir Humphrey Gilbert, are depicted 
as little better than freebooters, ahnost pirates 
in fact, and as probably animated much more 
with the love of adventure and of easily gotten 
pillage than with religious or national enthu- 
siasm. It is not a pleasant picture of an age 
that the Protestant historians have taught us 
to look upon as one of inspiring religious 
patriotism. Moreover, while the author is care- 
ful to state that England wholly underesti- 
mated her own naval strength in the contest 
with Spain, he proves in fact that the Great 
Spanish Armada was but an empty bubble that 
burst upon the first contact with the efficient 
fleet of England. The English ships .were 
quick, active, fast sailers, supplied with heavier 
guns of longer range than were the Spanish, 
and were manned with sailors who also fought 
the «iiip ; while the Armada consisted of poorly 
equipped and poorly victualed floating forts, in 
which the sailors had no share in the fighting, 
and which were crowded with troops and com- 
manded by soldiers. These vessels were expected 
to come to hand-to-hand conflicts with the 
enemy, when the valor of the Spanish troops 
was counted upon to win the victory; but, 
clumsy in movement and hadly sailed, the sol- 
diers in them never had a fair chance to prove 
their reputed valor. The English simply kept 
their distance and maintained a steady pound- 
ing of the enemy. Storms and bad weather, 
according to Mr. Laughton, had little to do 
with the English victory, for an entire week of 
good weather intervened between the opening 
of the conflict and the beginning of tempests. 
Of the Spanish ships, many of the hundred and 
thirty belonging to the Armada were mere 
transports, or supply ships, with no fighting 
qualities whatever ; so that in the final analysis 
the real 'men of war' numbered about fifty 
on each side. The entire victory was simply 
the victory of newer and better ships, heavier 
guns, and newer methods, over an antiquated

pattern of vessel and an obsolete style of naval 
warfare. It was in truth a mere slaughter, as 
is shown by the fact that the English lost but 
some sixty men all told in killed and wounded, 
though many sailors died soon after from a 
disease that broke out in the fleet; while the 
Armada lost sixty-three ships and thousands 
of men. Tliese figures prove, better than any 
words, the inequality of the contest. 

This analysis of Philip II.'s famous attempt 
to invade England is unquestionably in perfect 
harmony with the best results of modem his- 
torical research, and is therefore to be wel- 
comed on the ground of historical accuracy; 
but the danger in such studies is that the writ- 
ers forget contemporary opinion, which is after 
all the chief interest in historical study, and, 
by dwelling on the errors into which contem- 
poraries fell, underestimate or even lose sight 
of the importance and influence of the very 
misapprehension of the facts. The importance 
of the defeat of the Armada, viewing it from 
its effect on the English nation, lies largely in 
the fact that the people believed that England 
had won a victory against overwhelming odds. 
This is in some measure indicated by Mr. 
Laughton, but not with sufficient emphasis. 
His delight in proving the actual superiority of 
the English fleet blinds him in a degree to the 
devout thankfulness of the nation at a God- 
sent preservation. 

In treating of the years after the Armada of 
158S, the author is not so critical; for he re- 
gards that year as practically marking the con- 
clusion of the struggle between England and 
Spain for the supremacy at sea. In fact, how- 
ever, two authors, Mr. Julian Corbett in *The 
Successors of Drake ' and Mr. Martin Hume in 
'Treason and Plot,' have both conclusively 
demonstrated that the last ten years of Eliza- 
beth's reign were years of increased Spanish 
effort for the overthrow of England. Mr. Cor- 
bett ranks the Armada of 1599 as a more tre- 
mendous effort on the part of Spain, and as 
more dangerous to England, than that of 1588 ; 
while Mr. Hume, both in the book just named 
and even in his two chapters in the present 
volume, shows the wave of patriotism and the 
desire for revenge that swept over Spain when 
the news of the defeat of 1588 was received. 
Possibly the period assigned to Mr. Laughton 
extended beyond that in which he had a special 
knowledge, and he was thus led to conclude 
his article with the old accepted tradition, not 
being aware that the tradition had recently 
been undermined. This is not a criticism of 
the specialist, for the specialist's knowledge 
must stop somewhere; it is rather an inevitable 
fault of a general history written by a number 
of specialists. E. D. Adams. 



Stories and Traditions of tite 
Pawnee Indians.* 



Dr. George A. Dorsey is an indefatigable 
worker in the field of American folk-lore. Dur- 
ing the past few years he has paid particular 
attention to that extremely interesting group 
of Plains Indians known as the Caddoan 
stock. His studies in regard to the religion and 
mythologies of the tribe forming this stock are 
of exceptional interest. The Caddoan family 
includes the Arikara, Caddo, Kichai, Pawnee, 
and Wichita. The legends of the Arikara and 
the Wichita have been published by Dr. Dorsey 
under other auspices; the stories gathered 
among the Skidi Pawnee are presented in 
the volume before us. The Arikara and the 
Pawnee are closely related. The Pawnee 
themselves are divided into three subdivis- 
ions, — the Ghaui, Pitahauirat, Kitkehahki, 
and Skidi Pawnee. It is probable that the 
Skidi are in reality more closely related to the 
Arikara than they are to the other groups of 
so-called Pawnee. 

The Pawnee, as long as they have been 
known, have been tribes of the great Plains. 
Their ancestral home in j^ebraska was a brok- 
en, dry, sandy district, with a scant growth of 
timber along the water-courses. It was a fa- 
mous hunting-ground, abounding in buffalo, 
deer, antelope, otter, beaver, mink wolves, coy- 
otes, and foxes, and in the mountains westward 
bears and mountain lions. The nature of the 
country in which they formerly lived has in- 
fluenced, as is natural, the form of the stories 
themselves. 

In an introduction of some twenty pages, 
Dr. Dorsey gives the more important facts re- 
garding the life and customs of the Pawnee. 
Chief in interest, among these, are their social 
organization and their religion. In their social 
organization, the Skidi show no trace of the 
clan, or gens, so commonly the social unit 
among American Indians. The village is the 
element. Of these, there were nineteen, each 
with its sacred bundle. Marriage within the 
village was endogamous; each village had a 
hereditary head-chief, and the people of the vil- 
lage were considered descendants of the orig- 
inal owner of the sacred bundle preserved in it. 
Below the chief were four braves, police under 
his direction; below the braves ranked four 
priests, after whom in consequence were the 
medicine-men and the warriors. Last of all 
were the common people. In this lack of clan 
organization, in the hereditarv chiefship, in 
the importance of the sacred bundles, and in

the Tillage system, the Pawnee were quite pe- 
culiar among American tribes. 

In their religious thought and practice they 
were quite as interesting. They recognized a 
supreme being, Tirawa, whose commands were 
executed by lesser gods; next to him and his 
wife — the vault of heaven — was the evening 
star. She was the mother of the first terres- 
trial beings, their father being the morning 
star ; her four attendants — wind, cloud, light- 
ning, and thunder — transmitted Tirawa's 
mandates to the people. Her garden of grow- 
ing grain and her herds of buffalo were the pro- 
totypes from which terrestrial fields and herds 
drew life. Her husband, the morning star, 
ranked next to her. To their child, a girl, the 
Skidi formerly offered a maiden as a sacrifice. 
After these divine beings came the gods of the 
world quarters, creators of all but the first 
pair; then a crowd of other meteorological and 
stellar deities, each with his place and func- 
tion; then followed the divine animals and the 
messengers. The Skidi had a remarkably de- 
eloped star-cult, influencing the arrangement 
and location of their villages when they came 
together to celebrate the great ceremonials. 
These were then so placed as to reproduce ter- 
restrially those distributions which the gods had 
made in the celestial vault. The mysterious 
bundles used in the village ceremonials were de- 
rived from the god of the village. These bun- 
dles vary, though their general similarity is 
evident. Each contains at least one pipe, to- 
bacco, paints, certain birds, and the mother 
corn. These objects were wrapped in a piece 
of buffalo-skin, and the bimdle thus formed 
was treated with respect and was in charge of 
a regularly recognized owner. At the ceremon- 
ial of each bundle, a ritual was sung and an 
offering was made to it. To the morning-star 
bundle a human maiden was sacrificed: to the 
evening-star bundle, tobacco, and the heart and 
tongue of a buffalo. Each bundle had its ap- 
propriate dance, performed in the ceremonial, 
and its particular origin story, which was nar- 
rated between the ritual song and the dance. 
It may be mentioned, in passing, that Dr. Dor- 
sey, with a great amount of trouble, has suc- 
ceded in securing a considerable number of 
these sacred bundles for the Field Columbian 
Museum, with which he is connected. 

The stories of the collection before us num- 
ber ninety-one. Among the most interesting 
of them are the origin stories of the bundles. 
There are, however, various other types, and 
Dr. Dorsey groups the whole collection under 
six heads : 1, Cosmogonic, including the origin 
stories of the bundles; 2, boy heroes; 3, medi- 
cine; 4, animal tales; 5, people marrying ani- 
mals, or becoming animals; and 6, miscellan- 



eous. On the whole, the character of the stor- 
ies, from the point of view of thought and ex- 
pression, is high; and they compare favorably 
with those of other Indian tribes. It would he 
interesting to present some of the more strik- 
ing features and elements of the tales, but the 
limits of our review prevent so doing. Many 
of them would be encountered in the stories of 
other tribes; while others are quite character- 
istic and local. The stories as a whole give an 
excellent idea of the life and thought of a 
Plains tribe. 

Two problems seem just now to fa^e the eth- 
nologist who collects and publishes the stories 
of barbaric peoples. The first is in regard to 
the form in which to cast the legend. It is 
clear that the simplicity of the original should 
be retained; but its sense and true merit ought 
not to be sacrificed in so doing. There is a 
tendency at present to give aboriginal stories 
in a broken dialectic form which is difficult of 
comprehension, and which mars and destroys 
whatever beauty the stories themselves may 
possess. Thus, in the dialect version of the 
legends of the Torres Straits islanders given 
by Haddon, we receive an impression of im- 
becilitv in the narrators; it is unfair to the 
native story-teller to weight him down 
with the imperfections of the badly- 
learned foreign language which serves as 
the vehicle of his narration. What is wanted 
is the meaning put with all the simple direct- 
ness and naturalness which the story-teller 
would give it if he were speaking in his native 
tongue. Dr. Dorsey has avoided this fault of 
dialect rendition; for fault it is, and not 
'scientific accuracy.' These Pawnee stories are 
told in good English, and adequately present 
what the teller meant to say. The second prob- 
lem is the dealing with indecent and obscene 
passages. In these Skidi tales. Dr. Dorsey 
throws such passages into Latin. It is difficult 
to see his rule of judgment, as many passages 
which are not Latinized are quite as objection- 
able as the worst of those which are. The pres- 
ent reviewer does not find in the Skidi collec- 
tion any matter which really needs to be thus 
treated. When there is really objectionable 
matter in aboriginal tales, one of two things 
may be done: if the passage is essential to the 
story, the whole story may be omitted; if the 
passage is not essential, it may itself be drop- 
ped, the remainder of the story being presented. 
The argument that it is necessary to give ev- 
erything, in order to present aboriginal thought 
and life, is false; there is no population but 
what has its stories that are best left unre- 
peated. The purpose of collecting ethnic tales 
is that we may compare their thought and 
expression with our own, and with those of

people related to us, yet the collections of pop- 
ular stories told among English and Dutch, 
French and German, contain no objectionable 
passages; and this is not because the Aryan 
mind is pure and produces naught that is foul. 
To compare an unexpurgated collection of In- 
dian stories with Aryan collections which have 
been carefully culled is highly unjust to the 
aboriginal story-teller. 

At the close of the stories, Dr. Dorsey pre- 
sents notes and explanations of points which 
otherwise might not be understood, and makes a 
few comparisons with similar stories from other 
peoples. One must regret that this work of an- 
notation was not more fully carried out. We 
have, however, said enough to indicate the high 
importance and interest of the work. The 
American Folk-Lore Society is to be congratu- 
lated upon keeping up the high quality of its 
memoirs. Volume VIII. is a worthy compan- 
ion to those which have preceded it. The book 
is illustrated with a number of full-page plates 
representing Pawnee types and interesting 
things connected with the games and ceremonies 
of the Skidi. Frederick Starr. 



The "Wisest of Frenchmen.* 

In the last analysis, the work is the inter- 
preter of the man. It may be, as in the case of 
Shakespeare, that the work is so tremendous 
that a final interpretation is next to impossible, 
and the man is hidden in the intense objectiv- 
ity of his creations; but such cases, after all, 
are rare. The man is bound to disclose his per- 
sonality in style and substance. Usually, how- 
ever, he does not make himself the direct sub- 
ject of his work; he is content to let himself 
shine through it. Pepys chose to treat himself 
as his own confessor, and an unsuspecting editor 
gave the confession to the world. The result 
is that we know Samuel Pepys better than any 
other man in English literature; we know his 
failings, all the little pettinesses that an ordin- 
ary man hates ,to confess even to himself, as 
well as all that makes him one of the best fel- 
lows in history. But Pepys had no idea that 
he was contributing anything to either litera- 
ture or literary history ; in this respect, at least, 
he was of all men most innocent. Not such was 
Michel de Montaigne. He wrote about him- 
self as about the subject he knew best; and in 
doing so he felt that he was but the representa-

tive of the human race, and therefore a sub- 
ject of perennial interest. And of the men who 
have presumed on their own excellence as lit- 
erary material, few have done so with greater 
justice or with greater self -content. 

Diverse and undulant Montaigne says he is; 
and few will contradict him. He was bom of 
an upper middle-class family, yet was taught 
by his father to associate with the peasantry as 
well as with his equals; the Eenaissance was in 
its full glory, and he was the inheritor at once 
of the new paganism and of the old mediaeval 
Christianity, with the result that he was three- 
quarters pagan and one-quarter Christian. He 
had no one settled philosophic or religious be- 
lief; the one science worth knowing thorough- 
ly, he felt, is that of living well and dying 
well, — * loyally to enjoy our being,' as he says. 
He roamed through literature, taking what he 
liked and neglecting whatever he found diffi- 
cult or not exactly to his taste. *If I speak 
variously of myself,' he says, * it is because I 
consider myself variously; all contrarieties are 
found in me, at this turn or that, in this way 
or another; bashful, insolent; chaste, luxur- 
ious; prating, taciturn; laborious, delicate; in- 
genious, dull; fretful, debonaire; lying, truth- 
ful; knowing, ignorant; and liberal, and avar- 
icious, and prodigal.' 

Professor Dowden, in undertaking a life of 
Montaigne, not only had the inherent difficulty 
of his tantalizingly varied subject, which placed 
him in competition with the Essays themselves, 
but had also the handicap of inevitable compar- 
ison with a series of biographies of established 
reputation. His work is the initial volume of 
the * French Men of Letters ' series, which is, 
of course, modelled on Mr. Morle/s 'English 
Men of Letters' series. It is as high praise, 
perhaps, as one can give, to say that the new 
series starts out as well and promises as much 
as the old. The general plan of the older ser- 
ies is followed in the matter of treatment and 
length. In its 360 pages, this work seeks to 
interpret the author not merely by the facts of 
his life but also by what he reveals of himself 
in his writings. And, as was said above, Mon- 
taigne lays himself bare for the inspection of 
the reader. The danger for the biographer 
was lest he should lose himself in the multi- 
plicity of this self-revealing detail. He avoided 
this danger by distributing what Montaigne 
says over the full period of his life. Thus, we 
see the essayist's noint of view toward his early 
training, which differed in so many respects 
from that of his contemporaries as well as 
from that of today; toward his remarkable 
friendship with La Boetie, which stands out 
as a great romance in an otherwise calm life, 
his intellectual and religious kinship with the

orthodox Sebonde, whose work he translated, 
at his fathers request, his life in his Tower, 
where he shut himself off from all the world, 
even from the wife of his bosom; toward, too, 
his magistracy, his life at court, and the may- 
oralty of Bordeaux. It is no cut-and-dried bi- 
ography, but an illuminated record of the 
mind and soul of the man whom Sainte-Beuve 
called * the wisest Frenchman that ever lived/* 
Miss Norton's books are different; they are 
rather a collection of essays of a critical char- 
acter, somewhat after the fashion of a doctorial 
dissertation. They seek to show the relation 
of the Essays to the earlier Sebonde transla- 
tion, the editorial work in connection with the 
posthumous publication of La Boetie^s writ- 
ings, and the like; they put forth the theory 
that certain of the essays, such as that on Van- 
.ity, are combinations of earlier unpublished es- 
says. The theory is a risky one for the various 
and undulant Montaigne, and one suspects that 
too much may be proved from the mere form 
of the Essays. The chief fault with Miss Nor- 
ton's books, however, is their unfailing dryness. 
Never for a moment does she arouse a healthy 
interest in her readers. Let one compare her 
chapter on the friendship of Montaigne and 
La Boetie with Dowden's, and he will see the 
difference between what mars and what makes 
a book. James W. Tctpper.

A hiatory of Public discussion of various re^ 
the American form movements connected with 
civil service. ^hg United States Civil Service 
during the past thirty-five years has resulted in 
valuable contributions to the literature of the 
subject. A trustworthy history of the inception 
of these movements, as well as the evils which 
they are supposed to cure, was needed, and has 
been furnished by Professor Carl Russel Fish, of 
the University of "Wisconsin, in a monograph of 
the Harvard Historical Studies under the title 
'The Civil Service and the Patronage' (Long- 
mans, Green & Co.) Mr. Fish examines the policy 
of each President, from "Washington to McKin- 
ley, toward the public patronage and tenure of 
office. He finds that "Washington pursued the 
plan of making appointments solely for meritori- 
ous qualifications, and removals only for the effi- 
ciency of the service. On this ground the first 
President removed seventeen officials during the 
eight years of his administration. The merit 
system held moderately well until the coming of 
President Jackson. Exact figures of removals in 
his administration are wanting. Professor Fish

sees in the inauguration of the spoils system the 
satisfaction of a large demand for 'reform' in 
administration, one species of reform being the 
casting out of professional office-holders. Another 
wave of reform marked the Whig inauguration 
of Harrison and Tyler in 1841, terminating the 
tenure of 304 Democratic officials. President 
Pierce caused 883 changes in office. All Presi- 
dents were not so fortunate as to follow a change 
in political parties; hence the plan was instituted 
of considering all appointments as made for four 
years only. The slight attempts to cast off the 
spoils system before 1876 were nullified by the 
Reconstruction era, the very nature of which 
aroused the strongest feelings of partisanship. 
Here the author keeps conscientiously within the 
pale of his subject, resisting the temptation to 
describe the scandals of Grant's second term, due 
largely to an abuse of the patronage. The diffi- 
culties under which reform movements in the 
Civil Service have made headway are well 
brought out by Mr. Fish. He attributes the suc- 
cess of these efforts, against the hostility of 
political machines and partisan leaders, to 'the 
non-partisan character of the movement at the 
same time that it has not been unpartisan.* Con- 
sequently it has received no serious check through 
the mutations of party fortunes. Other elements 
of strength, according to the author, may be 
found in the candor and publicity with which the 
movements have been conducted, and in the 
growth of pubHe sentiment as to the necessity for 
reform. Our modem extension of industry has 
also brought a demand for the application of 
business principles to government service. The 
volume is a valuable addition to the other num- 
bers in a valuable series, representing scholarly 
contributions to knowledge within the field of 
American history and administration. 

wuh pen and Thc true lover of books written

Dickens's country, askance at books written about

quently too dusty to repay him for the search 
for the few grains of wheat they may hold, and 
the reviewer too often lapses into a habit of 
relegating such volumes to the shelf from which 
he gives gifts to the indiseriminating acquaint- 
ance to whom a book is a book. In 'The Dick- 
ens Country,' however, the case is quite other- 
wise; and it is a real regret that the patient and 
devoted author can never know how great must 
be the appreciation of all lovers of the 
writings of Charles Dickens for the service 
he has rendered, nor how sincere must be the 
enjoyment of those who follow him on his chosen 
pathway. "With an enthusiasm tempered by 
sound judgment, and guided by an exhaustive 
knowledge of every page Dickens wrote, Mr. Kit-

again,— if, indeed, it cowld be done at all even 
now, s© many are the changes Time makes 
among the haunts of men, and so resistlessly does 
the commercial spirit wage war against every- 
thing that stands in its way. In the very inter- 
esting photographic reproductions with which the 
book is filled we can read at a glance the fortunes 
of the man whose career began in a little house at 
Portsea, and ended nearly sixty years later in 
the charming house at Gad's Hill. As we follow 
the pictures, and the delightful text by which 
they are illustrated, we wonder sometimes where 
Dickens ever found time to do anything else than 
pack and unpack his belongings, or why he had 
ever any serious thought of any other profession 
than that of a bagman, so incredible is it that one 
man could have lived in so many houses or stop- 
ped at so many inns. The world had been a 
poorer place, however, had either choice or cir- 
cumstance made his life other than it was; for 
from each halting-place, however brief the stay, 
the busy brain carried an impression, and from 
the vast fund of detail thus accumulated there was 
never a lack of material for the proper setting for 
any character or any effect it might wish to pro- 
duce. It had been impossible that even one of 
Dickens's novels had been written, but for that 
restlessness,— inborn, perhaps inbred, by the 
peculiar conditions of his life ; and it had surely 
been out of the question to have given us the 
England of Dickens's novels— but for the Eng- 
land of Dickens's life. Not the least interesting 
part of the book is the short introduction, in 
which Mr. Arthur Waugh tells us something of 
the life and character of the gentle and kindly 
man, since dead, who prepared this charming 
book. (The Macmillan Co.) 

Biography of 'The Wealth of Nations,' says 
'ile^'Team^ Mr. Francis W. Hirst, 'is a book 
of Nations.' to be read as it was written. 

More than half its nutriment and all its fascina- 
tion is lost if you cut away the theory from its 
historical setting.' Such, it would seem, is the 
central thought about which Mr. Hirst has writ- 
ten his biography of Adam Smith for the 'Eng- 
lish Men of Letters' series (Macmillan). The old 
extenuation of any tendency toward narrowness 
in 'The Wealth of Nations,' i. e,, 'insular con- 
ditions,' which we had swallowed whole, so to 
speak, seems superficial indeed when with Mr. 
Hirst we follow Adam Smith's early career, his 
connection with the University of Glasgow, hia 
travels in France, his timely observation of dis- 
turbed affairs at home and his very unusual op- 
portunities to sift matters in argument with his 
keen-witted circle of friends. As Mr. Hirst car- 
ries us gradually along through these various 
phases of Adam Smith's life, he insistently shows 
how each in turn left its mark, and how ' The 
Wealth of Nations' was the logical result. It is 
Adam Smith's pre-vision alone that is relegated 
to the regions of the inexplicable. The task the 
author set for himself he has accomplished with 
thoroughness and even with interest; for there is 
about this biography no suggestion of dullness. 



Especially dextrous is his defense of Adam 
Smith's relations with the French school and of 
his attitude toward Free Trade. His friendship 
with Hume, devoted, though oftentimes assum- 
ing a controversial attitude, seems to have been 
his greatest mental stimulus, although he was 
also deeply influenced by his contact with such 
men as Burke, Franklin, and Pulteney. But it 
is by no means to be inferred that Mr. Hirst, in 
emphasizing the importance of 'The Wealth of 
Nations,' has neglected Smith's earlier writings, 
for 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments' is ably 
discussed and contrasted with the author's later 
work. And, further, Mr. Hirst has given us a 
fund of incident and anecdote of Adam Smith 
and his times which will be diverting even to 
those readers who profess no interest in 'the 
dismal science' of political economy. 

Essays by the The lectures of Dr. Felix Adler,

creediess chnrch. t^e Ethical Culture Society, of 
New Yoi'k City, are read with as much interest as 
they are listened to from Dr. Adler 's pulpit in 
Carnegie Hall. His books on 'Life and Destiny' 
and on 'Marriage and Divorce' aroused a deep 
and sincere interest at the time of their publica- 
tion. But Dr. Adler is too busy doing active 
work to be able to spend much time preparing his 
lectures for publication. Feeling that 'to put 
into the hands of earnest people the words of one 
who has been a leader to many would be to extend 
an influence which may contribute to the prog- 
ress of the higher life, ' Mr. Leslie Willis Sprague 
has undertaken the pleasant task of arranging 
and editing some Qf Dr. Adler 's most characteris- 
tic and vital lectures, and these are now published 
under the title 'The Religion of Duty' by Mc- 
Clure, Phillips & Co. Duty is the watchword of 
the Ethical Society, although it cannot be called 
a part of its creed, since Dr. Adler distinctively 
emphasizes the fact that the Society has no creed, 
—that in this 'Church of the unchurched' no 
man's religion, not even that of the founder and 
leader, is or need be subscribed to by all the mem- 
bers. The point of union is not a common re- 
ligion, or even a common philosophy, but the 
'fundamental conception that progress in right 
living is the paramount aim of life; that right 
thinking and right believing are important only 
as they lead to right living, and that the think- 
ing and believing must approve themselves to be 
right by their fruits in conduct.' Dr. Adler 's 
religious lectures gain rather than lose in interest 
through the fact that they are the expression of 
his personal opinion. Especially interesting are 
the first lectures, on 'First Steps Toward a 
Religion,' 'Changes in the Conception of Gk)d,' 
and 'Teaching of Jesus in the Modem World.'

offers for the development of a child's industrial

making of their tools, the building of their 
houses, each contains an idea "whi-'h can be made

the senses, through the hand, the eye, the ear, 
which forms the basis of modern industrial edu- 
cation, is the general theme of Miss Dopp's book. 
She holds the theory, well substantiated, that the 
child grows along the lines in which the race has 
grown; his earliest instincts are the instincts of 
early man, and it should be the object of the in- 
telligent educator to satisfy these instincts in 
work and play and to be ready for the natural 
advance to the next stage of growth. How this is 
being done in various schools of the country is 
shown in illustrations of children at work. These 
illustrations are another new feature of this edi- 
tion of Miss Dopp's book. 



The quest of

There is a great deal of what Mr. 
William James calls ' the religion 
of healthy mindedness ' in Mr. 
Clarence Lathbury's 'The Balanced Life' (The 
Nunc Licet Press). This ideal existence, accord- 
ing to Mr. Lathbury, consists in an adjustment of 
ourselves so perfect that we are 'not conscious of 
distinct faculties, but only of a happy and whole 
life.' With this end in view, he bids us culti- 
vate the health of both body and spirit; for 
through their concerted action we are to find 
life in its best sense. Undreamed of possibilities 
of happiness, he says, lie latent in each one of 
us; but an almost universal lack of the physical 
and mental balance stands as a proof that we are 
not yet arrived at perfection but only on the road 
to it. Mr. Lathbury possesses not only a great 
deal of optimism but also a sensitive responsive- 
ness to Nature, which will appeal especially to 
those who shall seek 'The Balanced Life' under 
his pleasant guidance.

of Voyages along the New England Coast, 1524- 
1624,' with notes by Mr. George Parker Winship. 

A new book by Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard, 
having to do with Stevenson, Bret Harte, Gail 
Hamilton, and others with whom the author was in- 
timately asociated, will be published this fall by 
Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co. 

The first volume of an authoritative edition of 
the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin will

Macmillan Co., who promise the first volume this 
month. The five hundred sets of ten volumes each 
will be uniform with the de luxe editions of Walter 
Pater, Edward FitzGerald, and others, published by 
the same house. 

With its September number, which commences the 
sixth volume of the magazine, 'The Printing Art' 
announces a considerable reduction in its subscrip- 
tion price, made possible by recent admission to the 
second class mailing privilege. This periodical has 
80 far been a powerful force in elevating American 
typographic standards; and its influence has been 
the stronger because, unlike other journals of the 
same general class, its appeal is made no less to 
those who have to do with the planning and placing 
of printing than to those who actually execute the 
work. 

The ever-increasing interest in Japan and the 
Far East is being fostered by the publishers with

G. Hatch's ' Far Eastern Impressions,' some in- 
teresting and jiertinent notes by a business man 
on Japan, Corea, and China; ' Arts and Crafts of 
Old Japan,' a popular introduction to the study of 
this subject; and a new revised edition of Mr. 
Ernest W. Clement's ' Handbook of Modern Japan,' 
containing a new chapter on the war, and new 
pictures. 

A series of dictionaries which commends itself at 
once for completeness and inexpensiveness is sent 
us by Messrs. Laird & Lee. There are five volumes 
in all, one an edition for library and office use, hand- 
somely bound in flexible leather and containing a 
dozen colored plates. The other volumes are espe- 
cially designed for school use, including high school 
and collegiate, students' common school, interme- 
diate school, and elementary school editions. All of 
these are illustrated, and with the exception of the 
two last-named they contain considerable supple- 
mentary matter of a useful character, such as dic- 
tionaries of mythology, biography, and geography, 
lists of musical, legal, and medical terms, etc. The 
vocabularies include many new and technical words 
not heretofore included in lexicons of this sort, the 
definitions are concise and intelligible, etymology is 
freely indicated, synonyms are fully given, capital 
initials are used in words that invariably require 
the capital, degrees of adjectives and plurals of 
irregular nouns are stated. These numerous points 
of advantage, and the low prices at which the vol- 
umes are sold, should make a wide popularity for 
the series.

EDITORIAL WILD OATS 

By MARK TWAIN 
This new volume contains several of Mark Twain's 
funniest sketches, narrating various journalistic 
experiences of his youth. In general appearance 
the volume is similar to " The Jumping Frog " and 
" A Dog's Tale," which have been decided favorites 
among holiday book-buyers during the last two sear 
sons. Among the stories are " Journalism in Ten- 
nessee," "My First Literary 
Adventure, " "Mr. Bloke's 
Item," "How I Edited an 
Agricultural Paper," and 
other bits of literary whim- 
sicality and adventure which 
have become widely popular 
among the veteran humor- 
ist's well-known writings.

THE LINE 
OF LOVE 

By JAMES BRANCH 
CABELL 



WITH FLASH-LIGHT 
AND RIFLE 

By C. G. SCHILLINGS 

With Striking Reproductions of Photo- 
graphs of Wild Animals taken at Night 
in their Native Haunts in Africa 



A group of exquisite, me- 
diaeval love-stories in a 
volimie that must win the 
admiration of all, with 
its full-page illustrations in 
color by Howard Pyle and the daintiest of marginal 
decorations in tint. A certain unusual poetic quality, 
a touch both serious and piquant, in the narrative give 
distinction to Mr. CabeU's work. He has beautifully 
preserved the passionate, romantic atmosphere of the 
Middle Ages, and each tale is rich in incident and 
glowing with color and action. The stories purport 
to be taken from the annals of a noble French family 
covering a period from 1350 to 1550. The volume is 
an exceptionally beautifvd specimen of book-making. 

Illustrated. Royal 8v0y Gilt Top, Uncut Edges, 
in Box, $2.00. 



The author, a prominent German naturalist, 
with the aid of over one hundred assistants, 
gathered in tropical Africa the materials 
for this book, now the literary sensation in 
Germany and the most remarkable study of 
the life of wild animals that has ever been 
made. It is profusely illustrated from start- 
ling and unique photographs, taken with 
special apparatus for long-range work and 
at night by flash-light, showing wild animals 
in their native haunts. The text contains 
much novel information, and is of graphic 
interest. Mr.Schillings's daring adventures 
read like fairy tales. 

Price, $2.00 net. 



POLE BAKER 

By WILL N. HARBEN 
Pole Baker will be remembered as a humorous 
character in "Abner Daniel." In response to a 
popular demand Mr. Harben has given him wider 
scope by making him the central figure in his latest 
novel. A shrewd, kindly, shirt-sleeves philosopher, 
Pole Baker has some capital yarns to tell, as well 
as an important part to play in the love affairs of 
a young couple with which 
the narrative is chiefly con- 
cerned. The characters and 
scenes are again those of 
Georgia, and the same good- 
humored, delightful narra- 
tive winds leisurely through 
this story as in its popular 
predecessors.

REBECCA 
MARY 

By ANNIE HAMILTON 
DONNELL 



Here is something out of 
the ordinary. The story 
of an amiable and singular 
child and her unusual quest 
for affection, — a book which 
is sure to prove a revelation to all men and women. 
It is altogether a new thing in fiction. Mrs. Donnell 
is unexcelled in her insight into and appreciation 
of child-nature. In depicting the sedate little 
Rebecca Mary she has created a new " heroine of 
fiction." All the charm of quaint old New England, 
with its delicate fragrance of box and lavender, 
lingers in this volume. The paintings in color by 
Elizabeth Shippen Green make the volmne unusu- 
ally attractive.

" An intelligent man, if he will apply his mind for a few hours to the study of this little book, may have a

the popular comprehension, and he would have been censurable had he hid his light under a bushel. While his book 
may have been intended for his students at the London School of Economics, and while his illustrations and appli-

THE CASE OF THE DRAMA. 



Now that the playhouses are fairly started 
upon a new season of enterprise, and we begin 
to get some notion, from managers and press 
agents, of the sort of dramatic fare the coming 
year is likely to provide for our nutriment, a 
few random comments upon the case of the 
drama may not be impertinent. That the case 
is a bad one, speaking, of course, for our own 
country, and for England incidentally, it takes 
no expert diagnosis to discover. The ailment 
is chronic, and the conditions thus far are sub- 
stantially those of last year, and of many years 
preceding. The theatrical menus vary in ap- 
pearance, but their offerings are of the same 
pastry and syllabub which spell indigestion 
and worse. "We have in prospect the same suc- 
cession of trick dramas, and tailor-made dramas, 
of dramas made to fit the mannerisms of par- 
ticular actors, of dramas — Heaven save the 
mark ! — whose most noteworthy feature is 
that they are without any possible pretension 
to be reckoned as products of dramatic art. 
Plus ^a change, pins c'est meme chose, but 
we supinely accept what our lords of the syn- 
dicate deign to give us, and utter no word 
of effective protest. 

Of the summer season that is past, and of 
summer seasons in general, we are not minded 
to make much account. The summer months 
are proverbially abandoned to silliness, and the 
stage does no more than enter into the spirit 
of the hour. It may be admitted that the sum- 
mer playhouse easily leads all its allied agencies 
of entertainment or distraction in competing 
for the palm bestowed upon inanity, and that 
some of the theatrical concoctions of recent 
years have attained a depth of imbecile vul- 
garity that one would have held impossible 
without the ocular and auditory proof. But 
leaving the silly season to its own peculiar 
pravity in things dramatic, we may at least be 
permitted to voice the concern with which all 
seriously-minded people view the abandonment 
of wellnigh our whole theatrical year to 
the shows of frivolity, the widespread prosti- 
tution of the drama to uses that, if not abso- 
lutely base, are unworthy of the traditions and 
the possibilities of that noble art. What with 
the gieed and vanity of performers, and the 
sordid commercialism of managers, considera- 
tions of art have small chance to prevail, and 



196 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



still less considerations of ethical and educa- 
tional responsibility. 

For the situation, as we so often have said 
before, is simply this: In every considerable 
country of continental Europe, the drama of 
to-day has its rightful place in literature by the 
side of the novel and the poem. It is a vital 
mode of expression, and enlists in its service 
the most penetrating intellect and the highest 
creative activity. It takes for its province all 
the manifestations of the spirit, and shrinks 
from the envisagement of no serious human 
relation. It moves with the stream of contem- 
poraneous tendency, and contributes a large 
element to the total volume of literary energy. 
It constantly produces work that is not only 
seen upon the stage, but is also published and 
widely read as a form of literature. In Eng- 
land and America, on the other hand, the 
drama has lost its vitality, and become little 
more than a low form of stagecraft. It has 
repelled the advances of those who might be 
makers of genuine dramatic literature, and 
driven them into the field of the closet drama. 
It has narrowed its outlook to the superficial- 
ities of life, rejecting the essence and keeping 
in view the trappings alone. Its products are 
rarely found worth publishing in books, for 
they will not bear the scrutiny of reflective 
minds. For the future historian of our present- 
day literature, the acting drama will be liter- 
ally non-existent, since it will not be discover- 
able in printed form, and those who have 
known it by actual contact will not have found 
it worth remembering. To put the case con- 
cretely, the coming chronicler and critic of the 
dramatic annals of the later nineteenth century 
will find abundant material for philosophical 
comment and analysis in the writings of such 
Europeans as Messrs. Ibsen, Bjornson, Haupt- 
mann, Sudermann, d'Annunzio, Echegaray, 
Augier, Dumas, and Maeterlinck; but when 
he turns to England, he will find no metal 
more attractive than the plays of Messrs. Phil- 
lips and Pinero and Jones, and America will 
(rather shamefacedly, we should imagine) 
point to Messrs. Augustus Thomas and Clyde 
Fitch, and say, ' These are my jewels.' 

We have grown so accustomed to this un- 
fortunate condition of affairs that few of us 
realize its appalling significance. The present 
regime seems to work smoothly enough; the 
managers get the money, the actors get the 
applause, and the public gets the entertain- 
ment. All these parties to the system play into 
each other's hands, while the critics, for the 
most part, accept the situation complacently, 
making the best of a bad business, now and 
then feebly protesting against some conspicu- 
ous offense, but on the whole letting well 
enough alone, and weakly abdicating their prop- 



er function. Meanwhile the public, which is 
the least culpable of the parties concerned — 
although severely enough censurable for its 
easy-going acceptance of things as they are — 
suffers at the worst a .degradation of all its 
standards of taste and morals, at the best a 
sort of slow spiritual starvation. 

We have thus sought to set forth existing 
conditions without much notion of suggesting 
a remedy. No remedy can be expected to oper- 
ate otherwise than by slow degrees, and by in- 
fluences gradually radiating from nuclei of 
earnest and self-sacrificing endeavor. Such a 
nucleus might be provided by a subsidized 
enterprise, under intelligent direction, under- 
taken either by public effort or private 
initiative. Such a nucleus already exists 
wherever a company of actors is found in any- 
thing like a permanent organization, working 
for a common interest and sharing a common 
pride. Such a nucleus would be found in any 
writer of genius, mastering the technique of 
dramatic composition, fixed in his determina- 
tion to make no concessions to a meretricious 
taste, and endowed with a fair measure of prac- 
tical good sense. The signs are not wholly 
lacking of the appearance of such nuclei, 
and of the crystallization of strengthening 
elements about them. And wherever they 
come into view, wherever something worth 
doing is seriously attempted, there is usually 
a gratifying response in the way of sub- 
stantial support. This is the encouraging 
feature of the seemingly hopeless case of our 
drama; this is the promising fact that nega- 
tives the time-worn managerial plea that the 
public is given what it demands. We believe 
that our commercialized showmen underesti- 
mate the public intelligence and capacity, and 
that this is the capital cause of a condition 
in things theatrical that we cannot too early 
or too insistently attempt to reform. 



THE PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION. 



The prevailing interest in historical study and 
research, and the great extent of the field in 
which historical students are at work, emphasize 
both the need of good translations of matter in 
foreign languages and the melancholy lack of 
them. Few historical students or editors or 
writers have the leisure or linguistic ability to 
make all their own translations, — especially 
when, as often happens, the matter they wishi 
to use is in three or four different languages, or 
when a book or document is located in some dis- 
tant library ; and thus they are forced to depend 
more or less upon the aid of others. There are 
plenty of would-be translators and alleged trans-

lation?!. but most of them seem to be Iticus a non 
lucendo; and he who depends on them is too 
often disappointed, injured, and (in this case 
righteously) exasperated. It would seem that 
he might reasonably expect a good English 
translation of a document in a language that he 
does not know, from a successful instructor or 
a ' star ' student in the language department of 
a, university, or from an official translator in a 
government bureau, or from a talented and 
educated person who has resided abroad for 
years and is considered a master of one or more 
foreign languages; but any one of these may be 
s. dismal failure when thorough and accurate 
translation is required. 

The causes of this deficiency would form a 
curious and interesting study; they are, of 
course, partly matters of experience and prac- 
tice, but among them appear certain psycho- 
logical factors, some of which are of the unex- 
pected sort. The practical difficulties of the 
historical translator are, it is true, very great; 
and no one can better appreciate these than does 
a competent translator, or the experienced stu- 
dent or writer who must have an accurate ren- 
<lering of a document. The earlier its date, the 
more will linguistic forms vary; and archaic, 
obsolete, provincial, and foreign words are apt 
to spring up like weeds along the translators 
path. He finds astonishing variations of proper 
names, especially those of places and of aborigi- 
nal tribes, which, usually recorded in more or 
less phonetic form by writers unfamiliar witli 
the language to which these belong, and often 
received at second or third hand from natives of 
other tribes, or from illiterate traders or soldiers, 
require for their identification both a natural 
perception of phonetic values and a well-trained 
ear. He encounters, too, mam' words denoting 
foreign plants, animals, weights and measures, 
moneys, weapons, industries, customs, peculiar 
institutions, official titles, and what not, that are 
new and strange to him, and often cannot be 
found in the usual standard lexicons, but on 
which he must obtain some information in order 
to make his English version intelligible. Often 
he cannot understand a geographical description 
without tracing a route or exploring an archi- 
pelago on the map. Some valuable writings were 
made by unlettered men, who had but slight 
knowledge of the mysteries of grammar and 
rhetoric, and whose spelling was French or Ger- 
man ' as she is wrote ' ; and it often requires 
much care and patience to ascertain just whaf 
they meant to say. Documents of this sort have 
a singular and fascinating attraction for one 
who can appreciate their human interest, and 
can see the picturesque and dramatic aspects of 
history; but educated and scholarly persons 
often turn with impatience and annoyance from 



the diary of a French voyageur, or the relation 
of a Spanish soldier, who, though he may be a 
keen obsener of savage character or customs, 
has often but very meagre knowledge of punc- 
tuation, spelling, and the proper sequence of 
tenses. Many questions arise which concern 
matters of fact, of historical or scientific accur- 
acy, rather than of grammar or idiom; and 
here guesses will not do, although they are 
made often enough to justify the sajdng, ' Fools 
rush in where angels fear to tread.' Xor will 
merely literarj* or linsruistic ability avail to 
make a good translation of matter which is more 
than a simple description or narrative. Matters 
political, commercial, ecclesiastical, or ethno- 
logical, complicate the task, and require for 
their elucidation an ' all-round ' training — 
worldly experience, a knowledge of affairs, and 
acquaintance with human nature. These same 
qualifications are needed for another and highly 
important part of the translator's work, the 
ability to supply what is lacking in the authors 
words, and even sometimes in his thought — a 
need which often arises in documents that were 
^v^itten at certain periods, or by persons of 
peculiar temperament, or those of deficient 
education. To pick up the dropped threads in 
such cases, and weave them into the pattern 
aright, is a delicate task, and is too often 
bungled or entirely neglected. 

The majority of translators display painfull)* 
inadequate qualifications and equipment for this 
work. Too many persons have the mistaken idea 
that a respectable grammatical and linguistic 
knowledge of a foreign tongue is sufficient for 
its translation; but this is only the beginning. 
Evoi more necessary is a thorough knowledge of 
the English language — command of its re- 
sources, a large vocabulary, familiarity with it;? 
fine shades of meaning, good taste in the selec- 
tion of words, directness and simplicity of con- 
struction, and clear and concise expression. 
Many translators seem quite unable to grasp a 
sentence or paragraph as a whole, or to perceive 
the relations between several of these. Often it 
is impossible to obtain the real meaning of 
a phrase or sentence except when it is seen in 
the light of its context; and a single idea or 
statement may dominate or color a long account 
or exposition. Idiomatic expressions form a 
most difficult feature of translation; and yet ifc; 
quality and force depend greatly on the way in 
which these are handled. Often the authors 
thought needs some expansion in order to make 
it clear in English; but the translator must be- 
ware of reading into the text his own ideas, and 
too free rendering is a stone over which many 
stumble, — as also is the opposite fault, that of 
following with wooden literalness the words and 
syntactical peculiarities of the text. The trans- 



198 



THE DIAL, 



[Oct. 1, 



lator may here have to walk ' between the devil 
and the deep sea ' ; but the path is straight, even 
if it be narrow. Few translators seem to appre- 
ciate the importance of preserving, when possi- 
ble, the rhetorical figures of the original; these 
add tone and piquancy to the English rendering. 
Translations which might otherwise have some 
merit are frequently marred by faults like the 
following: clumsy, involved, or too long sen- 
tences; unnecessary verbiage; too abrupt and 
staccato a style; colloquial expressions in the 
midst of dignified speech; solecisms and ana- 
chronisms; too literal rendering of foreign 
idioms, and even failure to see that they are 
idioms; illogical order of words or sequence of 
ideas ; too many indirect grammatical construc- 
tions, which render the thought vague and weak 
in expression; lavish use of pronouns with an- 
tecedents unexpressed; tautology, alliteration, 
and uneuphonious combinations; and even con- 
siderable omissions of matter that is in the text. 
Most of these are very obvious faults, and their 
mention may seem to some superfluous ; but the 
following instances, actually encountered in 
editorial work, show that these suggestions 
are not altogether unnecessary. 

Some mistakes may be what our foreign 
cousins call ' errors of distraction,^ — such as 
translating marfil as ' marble ' ; norribre dc 
Jesus, 'number of Jesus' (on a map of 1791) ; 
guevos, ' guavas ' ; ' he caused his own head to be 
cut off ' {cabello being mistaken for cabeza) ; 
' he sent for food a hundred salted cows. ' 
But not as much can be said for such as 
these: * fastidious (pesadas) assaults upon her 
virtue ' ; 'a salutations method ' ; ' there is 
much and many good things to be said about 
them ' ; ' anointing her with holy water ' ; 
' mainlands that nobody had as yet found 
out'; * which matters it is very important to 
remedy, in order to avoid present tendencies 
going still further' (should be, * these matters 
should be considered, and some corrective be 
found to avoid further difiiculties') ; 'it is 
necessary, in very truth, that it be endeavored 
to have this and to attain it' (should be, 
' that an earnest ejffort be made to maintain 
what we now hold'); 'thus the sentinels 
cannot be held in check, nor the good collec- 
tions, which are necessary' (should be 'on 
this account we cannot maintain sentinel 
duty or the necessary precautions'). 

Still worse are such mistakes as these : A cer- 
tain statement of receipts and expenditures 
showed that the latter far exceeded the former; 
at the end was the statement, ' the usual debt of 

the treasury is dollars annually,' which was 

translated ' the balance in the treasury every 

year should be dollars.' Los loloes hicieron 

entradas en camucones was translated, ' the 



Joloes came here with chamois-skins ' ; it should 
be rendered, ' the Joloans made raids among the 
Camucones.' Another translator placed in the 
mouth of a Roman Catholic priest the words of 
a quotation from the Bible in the rendering of 
the King James version — at once a solecism 
and an anachronism, as the priest's letter was 
written two years before that version was pub- 
lished. Lord Stanley's translation of Pigafet- 
ta's Voyage (Hakluyt Society's publications) 
furnishes some rather surprising slips of this 
sort ; couteaux et forces is rendered ' knives and 
forks ' instead of ' knives and scissors ' ; est de 
la longueur d'un naveau, ' is of the length of a 
shuttle,' instead of ' is as long as a turnip ' (in 
describing the potato) ; both of these plainly 
jumping at conclusions. In one of Piga- 
fetta's vocabularies, he says. La pouldre 
dherhe qui mangent = capac; Stanley makes 
this. La pouldre dherhe=qui; mangent=^ 
capac. 

But words fail us to characterize properly 
such naive statements as these : ' I will send you 
advices by the next Japanese steamer' (written 
in 1594) ; or ' In summer the inhabitants of 
Cape Breton Island live very well on parrots and 
monkeys ' ; or this astounding exhortation from 
a priest to his brother, ' Let your heart collapse 
with the outbursts of love that you eject toward 
the Divine Goodness.' And it is difficult to un- 
derstand the mental process by which the follow- 
ing sentence was regarded as a translation of the 
words, Quatro galeras tengo en el agua y chusma 
para ellas de huenas hoyas a sueldo aunque mala 
yessa — ' I have four galleys in the water, and 
lumber therefor of good buoyancy, at a good 
price, although there is but poor gypsum ' ; 
it should read, ' I have launched four galleys, 
and have for them a gang of voluntary paid 
rowers, although a poor one. Even that — .' 

After all these things, come the psycholog- 
ical qualifications of a good translator; ' and 
the greatest of these, ' yet the one most often 
conspicuous by its absence, is imagination — an 
apparent paradox where rigid accuracy is re- 
quired, yet that faculty is really a prime 
requisite for the best work in translation. Often 
the true meaning of the original depends upon 
the writer's profession, or his peculiar environ- 
ment, or his attitude toward the subject of 
which he writes, or his own personal tempera- 
ment; and to understand it the translator 
needs the historical imagination which enables 
him to picture to himself the scenes and per- 
sons of a bygone day or a foreign land, to put 
himself into the writer's place, and to see men 
and things through the latter's eyes. No less 
important for the translator are a sympathetic 
insight which reveals to him the author's

methods of thought and feeling, and entire 
candor and freedom from prejudice; thus he 
can make the vrriter speak to the reader as if 
with his own and living voice. To this end, the 
translator must forget himself, and let his pen 
be moved by the writer's spirit; his main effort 
should be to reproduce the text, as nearly as 
possible, in such phrase and style as the author 
himself would have used if he had written in 
our language. Quick insight, delicate percep- 
tion, and fine intuition are most valuable in a 
translator's equipment; and as necessary in this 
work as in all others are patience, enthusiasm, 
and high ideals. 

The methods of the modem historical school 
render continually more requisite, and more 
imperatively demand, students qualified to make 
scholarly investigations, whose work shall be 
thorough, accurate, and reliable; and who can 
present its results in such form as to be credit- 
able to themselves and acceptable to scholars. 
Such work ought to be done so well that it 
need not be compared, verified, and revised to 
make it fit for use; but most editors and writers 
know only too well how rarely it can be found. 
The lack of such revision, and too ready confi- 
dence in one's assistants, have, as we all know, 
brought clouds upon the scholarly reputation 
of more than one writer. Even in the minor 
matters of grammatical correctness, tj'pograph- 
ical style, and handwriting, there are glaring 
deficiencies. ' The woods are full ' of Ph.D.'s 
whose handwriting is almost undecipherable, 
whose punctuation is utterly erratic, and whose 
English is atrocious; and some cannot even 
write a hundred words without misspelling 
some of them. In view of these undisputed 
facts, and considering that most of the indis- 
cretions of translation above cited (but a few, 
alas! out of the dreary many that are com- 
mitted) were written by advanced graduate 
students in universities, it would seem that 
especial pains should be taken, somewhere in a 
student's collegiate course, to ensure his being 
able, when he takes his A.M. (and still more 
his Ph.D.) degree, to write a translation, a 
magazine article, or a thesis, in at least respect- 
able English style and handwriting, so that it 
can be printed as it stands without disgracing 
him in those regards. Most advanced students, 
too, in any college of letters and arts, expect to 
do more or less literary or historical writing;* 
this is demanded by their work, is in ever} 
way desirable for their professional success, 
and is in many cases regarded as necessary proof 
of a man's ability and intellectual strength. 
Translation alone, without original work, 
affords congenial and honorable occupation for 
qualified persons. 



The universities and larger colleges may well 
be expected to do much toward equipping their 
students for creditable work as translators, edi- 
tors, and writers. To a certain extent, this is 
undoubtedly accomplished; but the results are 
still far from satisfactory. In too many cases, 
the student emerges from his academic life" 
firmly grasping the skeleton only of a language 
(the English not excepted), and as firmly be- 
lieving, like Don Quixote, that he is embracing 
his Dulcinea, 'queen of beauty' — and some- 
times even the skeleton soon becomes but dis- 
jecta membra. What is the use of spending 
six to nine years on the syntax, phonetics, phil- 
ology, and what not, of a language, unless one 
can make it alive in. his own thought, and rec- 
ognize the truth (as profound as simple) that 
language is the expression of thought? and, of 
still more importance, that aU the languages 
are but variations of the one universal lan- 
guage, the varying methods of expressing 
thought? The above-named accidents of 
language, without this result, constitute *a 
vicious circle,* in which too many students 
hopelessly revolve. Cannot the universities 
and colleges establish special courses for seniors 
and graduates in which they can learn these 
things to somewhat better advantage than at 
present; which — not forgetting, however, that 
the best editors and translators are, like the 
poet, ' bom, not made ' — shall train them in the 
simple, clear, and accurate presentation of 
thought, whether their own or another's, and, 
in the latter case, at once with impartialitjr and 
sympathy? This would be a valuable and dis- 
tinct gain to scholarship, and as well to the 
general reading public, which more and more 
avails itself of the results of that scholarship, 
and depends thereon as a basis for forming 
its own conclusions as to events, affairs, and 
men. Emma Helen Blaib,

Memories of Bayard Taylor.* 

'^This volume hath a pleasant look; its air 
nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our 
gentle senses.' Thus, in slightly modified 
Shakespearian language, one greets Mrs. Bay- 
ard Taylor's attractive book, ' On Two Conti- 
nents.' Nor does the promise of hospitable en- 
tertainment prove fallacious, as it so signally 
did in Duncan's case on entering Maobeth's cas- 
tle at Inverness. Mrs. Taylor's antecedents, 
•environment, and personal traits, all have con- 
tributed to make her the very sort of person one 
would most like to hear chat on the subjects she 
has chosen. 

Her father, the well-known astronomer Peter 
Andreas Hansen, an interesting character and a 
man of rare intellectual powers, was director of 
the ducal observatory at Gotha, being Encke's 
successor in that position. It will sufficiently 
indicate his quality to say of him here that, 
though largely self-educated, this sturdy son of 
humble Danish parents would sometimes aston- 
ish his daughter by reciting, with much elo- 
quence, odes from Horace, as he must have 
•equally surprised the astronomer Gauss by show- 
ing that he could repeat the Gottingen profes- 
sor's tables of logarithms without the book. 
Skilled in languages and music, he delighted in 
' Frithiof 's Saga,' and executed classical mas- 
terpieces on organ and piano. The mother was 
almost as remarkable in her way as the father in 
his. A beauty in her youth, she was descended 
from a stalwart line of Nimrods, huntsmen to 
the Duke of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg (no^\- 
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha) . The father of this lady 
rose to be Forstmeister to Duke August. 

The customs of Mrs. Taylor's girlhood, and 
her own dread of earning the reputation of a 
blue-stocking, forced her to make her intellec- 
tual acquisitions in secret. Of her literary abil- 
ity, the reading public has already had proof in 
the ' Life and Letters ' of her husband, the 
joint production of herself and Mr. Scudder. 
This work is sufficiently well known to make 
here unnecessary any outline of her and her 
husband's life together, the main theme of her 
present volume. Of the first meeting of these 
two, let the wife tell the storj'' in her own words. 

'In the autumn of 1851 my mother's brother- 
in-law, the landholder August Bufleb, made a jour- 
ney to the Orient, an undertaking so unusual in 
those days that it created quite an excitement in 
our little town. At the same time my future hus- 
band, Bayard Taylor, was also on his way to Egypt. 
He and my uncle, who at first intended to travel

■day, Page & Co. 



in Palestine, but was induced by the Prussian 
Minister at Constantinople to make the trip to 
Alexandria, met on the steamer which ran from 
Smyrna to the latter port. Both travellers, the 
German and the American, although far removed 
in age, felt g,ttracted to each other at once, and 
formed a friendship which lasted as long as they 
lived. . . . On his return my uncle never tired 
of talking of his young American travelling com- 
panion, and thus we learned that he was seeking to 
recover in foreign countries from the deep wound 
which fate had dealt him in the loss of his first 
love, to whom he had been wedded on her death- 
bed. We were all anxious to make the young man's 
acquaintance, and when in September, 1852, he came 
in fulfilment of his promise, the houses of the 
family in all its branches were opened to welcome 
him in the most hospitable manner, and even in 
more remote circles the appearance of this much- 
travelled stranger created a sensation. All who 
came in contact with him were attracted toward 
him, and he, for his part, in spite of the inherited 
reserve of his nature, was warm in praise of Ger- 
man Gemuthliehkeit. This quality was even in- 
herent in his own blood, as the ancestors of both 
his grandmothers had been German colonists. He 
was at that time twenty-seven j'ears old, his tall 
figure was still slender, his oval face deeply browned 
by the sun of the Orient. He gave the impression 
of an unusual, unspoiled, good and noble man, and 
thus he remained in my memory. I knew him but 
slightly at that time, as I met him only at the 
various dinners which were given in his honor by 
the family. That he would be my future husband 
did not enter my mind; nor did I seem to make 
any deep impression upon him.' 

The circumstances attending the marriage of 
Bayard Taylor and Marie Hansen, in the 
autumn of 1857, and the difficulty over the lack- 
ing baptismal certificate, without which the 
banns could not lawfully be published, are curi- 
ously like the incidents relating to another Ger- 
man-American alliance recorded by ex-Ambas- 
sadoT White in his recent reminiscences. But 
the difference in dates forbids their identifica- 
tion. The bride's first impressions of her 
adopted country are pleasantly given — so pleas- 
antly, indeed, that even readers not yet aged 
may be pardoned a sigh for the good old times 
before immigration and plutocracy and strenu- 
osity had combined to transform the ancient 
order of things. Referring to her first winter 
in New York, Mrs. Taylor writes : 

'Poets, authors and artists were welcomed in our 
hospitable house, and Stoddard wrote in later years 
of that time: "We were a nest of singing birds." 
George H. Boker, whose drama "Francesea da 
Rimini" was just being enacted, sometimes dropped 
in from Philadelphia; T. B. Aldrich, who had made 
his debut as a poet, was a frequent guest, and Ed- 
mund Clarence Stedman soon after became a mem- 
ber of our circle and one of our nearest friends. 
. . . Charles G. Leland, the painter Thomas 
Hicks, with their wives, Fitz-Hugh Ludlow and his 
wife (afterward Mrs. Albert Bierstadt), belonged 
to our inner coterie, to which were later added 
Jervis McEntee and his charming wife, and San- 
ford R. Gifford, both landscape painters and genial 
men. Another guest of the early times was Orlando 
W. Wight (the translator of "Heloise and Abe- 



1906.]

lard"), who had a funny habit, when addressing 
anyone, of laying his white-gloved hand upon his 
heart with a sigh and a flourish.' 

Thoee were halcyon ^ays for lyceum lecturers, 
and Bayard Taylor was one of the most popular. 
Country folk drove untold miles to hear him, 
and his rapidly accumulating fees soon built 
him his fifteen-thousand-dollar country house at 
Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, A passage from 
one of the lecturer's early letters to his wife con- 
veys an idea of his fame in the land. 

'You would never guess that merchants, livery- 
stable keepers, mechanics and day laborers are 
among my admirers. The crowd was composed en- 
tirely of such. The baggageman on the train said 
to everybody, "B. T. is in the car — he is a big 
writer." "What did he write?" asked a man. 
"I don't know what it was," was the reply, "but 
he's the biggest kind of a writer!" ' 

Queer names oft^n came to Taylor's notice in 
liis Western tours. Worth recording is the 
Christian name Lettice in c-onjunction with the 
surname Pray, an actual combination designat- 
ing a real woman, a* the reader is assured. A 
man once introduced his little son to the lec- 
turer in this wise: ' We call him Xapoleon, and 
his little sister we have named St. Helena, after 
Xapoleon's wife.' Before dropping the subject 
of human oddities, room must be made for the 
old spinster of good Quaker family whom Mrs. 
Ta}lor knew at Kennett Square. This maiden 
lady, with even more than Quaker thrift, for 
years was wont to use as a bread-trough the 
coffin she had caused to be prepared for her 
burial — when she should no longer need bread, 
one is tempted frivolously to add. 

Many matters so agreeably touched on in 
Stoddard's * Recollections ' here recur with a 
change of costume — or, rather, are presented 
from a new point of view. The subjoined pas- 
sage is of interest in this connection: 

'Each Sunday evening we saw a small select 
circle of friends congregate in our rooms. The 
Stoddards, Stedmans, McEntees, Aldrich, Launt 
Thompson, the Grahams, were habitues, to whom 
were often added the two Cranches, Fitz-Hugh 
Ludlow and wife, Sanford Gifford, and sometimes 
Edwin Booth and others. These evenings were en- 
livened by the ' ' Diversions, ' ' which in later years 
Bayard Taylor published in amplified form in the 
"Echo Club," and which afforded an entertain- 
ment sparkling with wit and humor. This amuse- 
ment was the continuation of a jeu d'esprit that 
originated in the middle of the fifties, when the 
trio of poets, Stoddard, Taylor, and Fit z- James 
O'Brien, vied in the exuberance of their imagina- 
tion with each other in the production of short 
comic poems whenever they met in Stoddard's 
quarters. These poetic gymnastics, supplemented by 
parodies of noted poets, were a never-failing source 
of the most delightful entertainment. As soon as 
one of our sons of the Muses had finished his in- 
spiration of the moment, he read it aloud amid the 
laughing applause of his hearers, who were never 
at fault in guessing the poet he had parodied, so 
unmistakable was the imitation of the principal 
characteristics of his poetic expression.' 



An interesting chapter is devoted to Taylor's- 
year at St. Petersburg, fir^t as Secretary of 
Legation, then as Charge d' Affaires in Minister 
Cameron's absence. In the critical state of our 
eountn^ at that time (1862-3), the post held by 
Taylor was one of responsibility. 

'It was necessary, in the face of any reverses- 
that the Union army might suffer, to preserve the 
confidence of the Eussian Government (hitherto the 
only friendly power) in the final victory of the 
North. As Taylor himself was firmly convinced of 
the certainty of this ultimate triumph, he at length 
succeeded, after several long and very interesting 
interviews with Prince Gortchacow, in enlisting the 
sympathies of this astute diplomat entirely on the 
side of the Federal Government, and in firmly es- 
tablishing the friendship of the two powers — Eossia. 
and the United States. In these diplomatic con- 
versations the personal magnetism which my hus- 
band possessed in so great a measure may perhaps- 
have contributed not a little to this result.' 

In 1878, the year of the Berlin Congress,. 
Taylor was appointed Minister to Germany^ 
During the summer months he sent frequent 
letters from Berlin to his wife in the country^ 
Here is one of them : 

'I burst into a laugh over your misgivings with, 
regard to the dinner at Bunsen's. If you go on,, 
you will finally be as bad as Neander's sister, and. 
will telegraph me every morning to put on my 
trousers before going into the street! As if I 
could forget it! No; and I shall long remember 
it. I like Bunsen more and more; I was first there,, 
met his wife and both daughters, and then came 
Helmholtz! While I was telHng him that I counted 
on his aid for material for my Biography of Goethe,, 
the door opened, and Lepsius appeared. Hardly- 
had I greeted him, when there was a new arrival 
Minister Waddington, of the Bepublie of France,, 
and one of the most simple, genial, and agreeable 
of men. Then Herr v. Norman, adjutant (or some- 
thing else) of the Crown Princess, whom I recog- 
nized at once, having met him years ago at Holtzen- 
dorff's in Gotha; next Curtius, and finally — Momm- 
sen! We had a beautiful, delightful dinner. I 
sat between Frau and Fraulein v. Bunsen, withi 
Curtius next on mv right, and Lepsius and Helm- 
holtz opposite. l' think I knitted the ends of 
friendly intercourse around all three. Curtius prom- 
ised to'send me photographs of the Olympia statues; 
and when I said that you would also be delighted 
to see them, he asked whether you had a special 
interest for classic art. So I spoke of your resi- 
dence in Home with your uncle [Emil Braun, archae- 
ologist, and author of "The Buins and Museums- 
of Borne"], and when I mentioned his name there 
was a general outburst of enthusiasm. All three- 
had known him personally, loved him, and were 
full of pietdt for his character and knowledge^ 
... I had afterwards a long talk with Wad- 
dington, and a short one with Mommsen. The 
evening was perfectly inspiring to me. . . .- 
To-morrow evening I am invited to meet the Con- 
gress at Lord Odo's, and Wednesday evening at 
Count Carolyi's. Cards come in by the dozen, and 
I scatter mine punctually in return.' 

3ilrs. Taylor likes a good story, and her book 
abounds in quotable anecdotes. Here is one- 
from her father's repertorium. The poet Oeh- 
lenschlager, with whom he had been acquainted

in his youth at Copenhagen, was once bored by 
an uncongenial admirer, an insignificant young 
man who, after obtaining an introduction, 
begged to be allowed to call upon the author at 
his lodging, and asked the address. 'I live at 
390 — Street,' said the poet. ' Oh ! ' ex- 
claimed the young man, ' how can I ever re- 
member the number?' 'Easily,' was the re- 
ply; 'you need only think of the Graces, the 
Muses, and yourself.' 

Mrs. Taylor's book is of handsome appear- 
ance, but not impeccable in its printing — or 
should we say proof-reading, or even go still 
further back ? ' Gaus,' ' esprit,' ' Fratilein,' and 
similar small errors, are encountered. The por- 
traits and the reproductions of Taylor's paint- 
ings that adorn the volume add much to its 
interest, as do also the occasional specimens, 
both German and English, of the poet's comic 
muse, now first published. Altogether, a more 
agreeable book of its kind could not well be 
imagined. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Art of Miniatures.* 



Forty years ago, the South Kensington 
Museum, in London, inaugurated its series of 
exhibitions of national portraits by bringing 
together a collection of over three thousand 
miniatures, chiefly British, which were not only 
collected and arranged but catalogued by the 
well-known art critic and historian of art, Mr. 
Samuel Redgrave, in a volume with an appre- 
ciative introduction upon miniature art and 
an invaluable appendix of biographical data 
respecting the painters whose works were ex- 
hibited. From this exhibition can be dated the 
renascence of interest in this delightful branch 
of art, and its catalogue was the first contribu- 
tion to its history, so that each is entitled to 
the meed of praise due to pioneer work. No 
wide interest in the subject, however, seems to 
have been taken for a full score of years, when, 
upon the publication of Dr. Lumsden Propert's 
' History of Miniature Art, ' with its wealth of 
beautiful illustrations, persons of taste and of 
means sought to gather examples of these ex- 
quisite gems, until to-day they form perhaps 
the most eagerly desired and the most highly 
prized collections in all the departments of the 
fine arts. This taste led to a demand for a lit- 
erature of the subject, which has been freely 
supplied by the volumes of Foster and of 
Williamson. But these were intended to be 
popular, and were built upon the false hypoth- 
esis that to be popular it is not necessary to be

Library.) Illustrated. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



accurate. They also so plainly showed the want 
of technical knowledge on the part of their 
authors, a knowledge absolutely necessary when 
writing upon any scientific subject, that they 
were not only far from satisfying to the intelli- 
gent student but quite misleading to the mere 
dilettante; and therefore it was a matter of 
much importance to those seriously interested 
in the subject, when it was announced that Mr. 
Dudley Heath, a scion in the fourth generation 
of a notable line of artists, and himself well 
equipped to follow them, was engaged upon a 
work on Miniatures, to be issued in the ' Con- 
noisseur's Library. ' The volume, now before 
us, leaves nothing of moment to be desired. It 
is historical, it is technical where it should be, 
it is scientific, it is critical; and above all it is 
interesting from cover to cover, so that in per- 
using it or in studying it one cannot help but 
feel he is being instructively led by a writer 
who has understood and carefully considered 
and weighed the subject upon which he treats. 
Unfortunately, there are few works for which 
so much as this can advisedly be said ; and Mr. 
Heath's treatise upon Miniatures stands out in 
bold relief in comparison with the many short- 
comings of his forerunners in the same field. 

The opening chapters of the book are devoted 
to a consideration of the origin of the mini- 
ature portrait, its growth in the illuminated 
rrianuscripts of the eleventh to the fifteenth 
centuries, and the influence of the art of print- 
ing on the art of the miniaturist or illuminator. 
This period of art development was purely 
Continental; for in England the art of paint- 
ing hardly had an existence at the end of the 
Middle Ages, and it was Hans Holbein, a Ger- 
man of Augsburg, born five years after the dis- 
covery of this continent, who introduced the 
art of portrait miniature into Britain and with 
such success that she has since retained an 
almost exclusive preeminence in the art. To 
such a degree is this true that the art of por- 
trait miniature may be considered in some 
ways ' exclusively an English art. ' Its great- 
est exponents have been Englishmen, whose 
works, while 'limned in little,' bear compar- 
ison with the greatest portraits of the world. 
Yet Englishmen do not forget the German who 
introduced the beautiful art into their island, 
and some few months ago they paid tribute 
to his art and fame by giving the unprece- 
dented sum of $13,750 for a fine miniature 
from his hand. The pages given to Holbein by 
Mr. Heath are particularly to be commended, 
as they form a key to the method of the entire 
work, — finely critical and judicial without 
being captious and hard. 

Mr. Heath shows great skill in marshalling

and paralleling the different painters, from 
Milliard and the two Olivers, father and son, 
representatives of the first period of portrait 
miniature of the English school, with whom the 
traditions of the illuminators may be said to 
have passed away, to John Hoskins and his 
nephew Samuel Cooper, leaders in the develop- 
ment, under the influence of Vandyke, of the 
seventeenth century as the greatest epoch in 
the English art of miniature portrait painting, 
down through its decadence in the next century 
"to its extinction in the middle of the last cen- 
tury, when, with the birth of sun-pictures and 
the passing away of Kobertson, Newton, and 
Ross, miniature painting as a fine art may be 
said to have taken its place among the lost 
arts. Mr. Heath's studies of the different 
painters are very skilfully drawn. Of Cooper 
lie says: 

*To Samuel Cooper must be given the proud 
position, of supremacy in his art. . . . He ex- 
celled all his predecessors, and has never been 
equalled by any miniaturist since, far less sur- 
passed. In fact, it is hardly too much to say that 
Samuel Cooper's art contains the finest qualities 
possible in the miniature portrait; character, ex- 
pression, breadth, vigour, and solidity, combined 
with masterly balance of light and shade, sim- 
plicity and dignity of colour, and withal a grace 
and nobility of treatment which more than coun- 
terbalance the lack of minute finish, for which he 
las sometimes been disadvantageously compared 
with Isaac Oliver.' 

If to this analysis anj-thing can be added, it is 
to note the great distinction of Coopers por- 
traits and to emphasize more strongly his won- 
derful breadth of treatment in so small a scale, 
"which is the key-note to Walpole's oft-quoted 
•eulogy, ' If a glass could expand Coopers pic- 
tures to the size of Tandyke's, they would ap- 
pear to have been painted to that proportion. 
If his portrait of Cromwell could be so en- 
larged, I do not know but Vandyke would ap- 
pear less great by comparison. ' Of John 
Smart, Mr, Heath writes : 

'Without any ostentatious cleverness, Smart 
painted with a thoroughness and delicacy which 
liave a charm of their own, and his miniatures no 
doubt appealed to that less " flash" portion of so- 
•ciety which valued an excellent portrait more than 
an idealized semblance of a person. Though the 
miniatures by John Smart are often considered to 
"be of exceptional merit, and at the present time 
fetch fancy prices, I am inclined to think that their 
laborious and over-modelled gradations of the flesh- 
tints place them outside the category of master- 
pieces. ' 

Ozias Humphrey, he says, ' was one of the most 
tjharming miniaturists of the eighteenth cen- 
tury. . . . He is certainly one of those mini- 
aturists whose work stands out as unique for 
its beauty of execution, its mellowness of 
c-olour and tone, and graceful arrangement. ' 
Mr. Heath could have gone much further in his 



appreciation of Humphrey had he judged him 
by his oriental miniature portraits, which seem 
to be unknown to him, and without fear have 
placed him next to Cooper, for his characteriza- 
tion, breadth of handling, and atmospheric 
qualities of tone and color, which easily make 
Humphrey the first miniature painter of his 
time. To many, with the glamour of Richard 
Cosway's dainty work in mind, this will seem 
impossible. But read what Mr. Heath has to 
say of this idol of fashion, a view the present 
writer has always entertained: 

'From the middle of the eighteenth century tiU 
the middle of the nineteenth, we have an uninter- 
rupted array of excellent miniaturists, but during 
the whole of that period, and even to the present 
day, the name of Eichard Cosway has dominated all 
others. This prolonged and universal admiration of 
an artist is in itsefi a most eloquent eulogium on 
his merits, though it is not necessarily a convincing 
proof of his claim to this preeminence. That an 
admiration of Cosway's style is well justified 1 
should be the first to allow, but I would also insist 
that infatuation is not indicative of intelligent 
appreciation, — that to be sensible of the charm and 
graceful genius of a Cosway should not make us 
insensible to the great and noble qualities of a 
Cooper. If the eighteenth century genius pleases 
our most sensitive tastes and appetites, the seven- 
teenth century genius stirs our deepest sympathies 
and appreciations. It is impossible to deny the 
charm which a fine Cosway possesses; its refinement, 
its grace, its delicate dexterity appeal at once to 
our sense of the beautiful. The directness and 
easy finesse of the handling, the subtle balance of 
tone, colour, and modelling, give added power io 
the expression, forcing us, as it were, to admire 
what our better judgment would proclaim as insin- 
cere. . . . Where the art of Cosway fails is in 
the limitations of his inspiration or vision. He 
may be described as a man who had chained him- 
self to a fetish — a standard of beauty — ^which 
denied him the power of free vision- A face was 
to him but a mask, more or less capable of being 
conformed to his convention of the beautiful; but 
having been conformed, then he expressed himself 
with aU the grace, facility, subtlety, and charm that 
were peculiar to his genius.' 

This excellent criticism of Cosway's art will 
hardly commend itself to the twentieth century 
connoisseur, but if it were widely diffused 
among and digested by them, it might help to 
reduce the traffic in spurious Cosway s which to- 
day flood the market and find their way into 
cabinets composed of nothing, according to the 
view of the owner, but ' authentic and orig- 
inal works.' 

With a work such as this before us, there is 
a strong temptation to forget we are writing a 
review of a book and not a book itself; and I 
think I have gone far enough to show that Mr. 
Heath has done his work with exceptional 
thoroughness and skill. There is only one point 
in which the book is singularly and unfortun- 
ately deficient. The closing pages are given 
up to ' Foreign Portrait Miniaturists, ' and

we read of Ital}-, Germany, and France, but not 
a word of America or the United States. Can 
it be possible that a man as broad and as en- 
lightened as Mr. Heath does not know of us 
and our miniature painters? Is it possible 
that a man who has given so much study to 
the subject in hand has never heard of Ed- 
ward Greene Malbone, to say nothing of the 
Peales, and Trumbull, Wood, Trott, Field, and 
Staigg? He does not even mention John 
Singleton Copley, who lived in England from 
1774 until his death in 1815, and painted mini- 
atures both here and there. But is there not a 
revelation and a treat in store for Mt. Heath* 
when he does see the best of Malbone's exquisite 
miniatures! With his fine critical sense, will 
he not take off his hat and leading him by 
the hand place him after Cooper, shoulder 
to shoulder with Ozias Humphrey, in the 
van, ahead of Richard Cosway? It is to be 
the writer's privilege soon to tell the history 
of American Miniatures so curiously over- 
looked by Mr. Heath. 

A word must be added as to the forty-two 
plates contained in the volume, few of which, 
by the way, are bound in where the index 
places them. The processes employed, photo- 
gravure, collotype, and three-color printing, 
may be the best available for book purposes, 
but none of them is satisfying for reproduc- 
ing miniatures as miniatures. All they accom- 
plish is to make pictures of the miniatures. 
They reduce every man's work to a technical 
equality. They are of no help as aids to 
study. The photogravure has the disadvan- 
tageous mending of the intermediary engraver; 
and the collotype is broken up past recall. 
The color-plate has no value whatever as 
illustrating the color sense of the painter 
whose work it reproduces; it merely gives 
the color scheme, and that not very well. 
According to the color plates in this volume, 
the sense and feeling for color of the limner of 
Philip the Good, in the fifteenth century, of 
Mansion, in the nineteenth, of Cooper and of 
Cosway, are almost precisely the same. Will 
not some expert experiment with reproductive 
processes until he conquers these deficiencies?

A Book of IjItebary Heretics.* 

Mr. Gilbert Chesterton is quite on his own 
ground in writing about Heretics. Such sub- 
jects as Kipling, Shaw, Whistler, H. G. Wells, 
the new paganism, and the importance of or- 
thodoxy possess brilliancy enough in themselves 
to satisfy even this arch-priest of brilliancy in

style. Mr. Chesterton is nothing if not clever, 
— so clever, indeed, that he anticipates all the 
reviewer's descriptions of him. For instance, 
nothing would be pleasanter than to say of Mr. 
Chesterton that he is one of the most brilliant 
and one of the most honest men alive, but that 
we are concerned with him, not in this capacity, 
but in that of heretic, — that is to say, a man 
whose philosophy is quite solid, quite coherent, 
and quite wrong; nothing would be pleasanter 
than to say this if Mr. Chesterton had not al- 
ready said it of Mr. Bernard Shaw. Again, no 
description could more aptly be applied to the 
critic than this : ' The message upon which he 
has really concentrated is the only thing worth 
worrying about in him or in any other man. 
He has often written bad poetry, like Words- 
worth. He has often said silly things, like 
Plato. He has often given way to mere polit- 
ical hysteria, like Gladstone. But no one can 
reasonably doubt that he means steadily and 
sincerely to say something, and the only serious 
question is. What is that which he has tried to 
say?' Unfortunately, Mr. Chesterton fore- 
stalled such a criticism by applying it to Mr.. 
Eudyard Kipling. 

It is trite, as well as wrong, to say of Mr. 
Chesterton that he will never be taken seriously 
until he takes himself and the world more 
seriously. He believes in himself as firmly as 
it is possible for a man to believe whose the- 
ories of life and progress are based on that very 
faith. And he believes in the world, not in 
detail, but in the mass, as cosmos. If he laughs 
at Chesterton and at the world, it is the laugh 
of understanding, not of derision. His humor, 
his paradoxes, his recurring epigrams, are not 
the marks of weakness or insincerity in his 
philosophy but of strength in his style. He is 
able to laugh because he sees things large. If 
he is weak, it is not in being funny, but in 
being fallacious. It is hard to conceive of his 
equal in the natural instinct to feel things 
rightly, and the ability to twist them in the 
saying. His book would make an invaluable 
addition to the literature of logical fallacies. 

Recurring to his own question of what it is 
that he has tried to say, we find that he means,, 
first and finally, that the modern affectation of 
indifference to all eternal things is unprogres- 
sive and debasing. When, at the beginning of 
the great nineteenth century, scientists re- 
nounced religion and philosophy for facts, they 
made a new religion and a new philosophy for 
themselves. They were substituting one creed" 
for another, calling God the Final Cause. The 
ultimate questions were quite as much in their 
minds as in that of the most devout priest or 
the most ascetic monk. To-day nothing ulti- 
mate is supposed to matter to anybody. As Mr- 
Chesterton writes: 



1905.] 



THE jyiAJL 



* We are more and more to discuss details in art, 
politics, literature. A man's opinion on tram-cars 
matters; his opinion on Botticelli matters; his opin- 
ion on all things does not matter. He may turn 
over and explore a million objects, but he must not 
find that strange object, the universe; for if he does 
he will have a religion and be lost. Everything 
matters, except everything. This was certainly not 
the idea of those who introduced our freedom. 
When the old Liberals removed the gags from all 
the heresies, their idea was that religious and philo- 
sophical discoveries might thus be made. Their 
view was that cosmic truth was so important that 
everj'one ought to bear independent testimony. The 
modem idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant 
that it cannot matter what anyone says. The 
former freed inquiry as men loose a noble hound; 
the latter frees inquiry as men fling back into the 
sea a fish unfit for eating.' 

It is certainly preposterous that in a civiliza- 
tion boastful of its progress, nobody but the- 
orists and dreamers should have any definite 
ideal of progress: that in a civilization proud 
of its freedom, nobody thinks to define or limit 
liberty; that in an age when everybody thinks 
his own thoughts, so few people really think 
anything. Mr. Chesterton is right. The most 
necessan- thing in the world is for men to have 
definite opinions about matters that are vitaL 
As a study of certain men who have definite 
opinions, Mr. Chesterton's book is interesting 
in its material, and through his brilliant hand- 
ling it is interesting in form. But it is not 
definitive, because it is not convincing. One 
of his most definite opinions is that science, 
especially that science which has human nature 
as one of its factors, is wrong in everj'thing. 
With this as major premise, he arsrues cleverly 
against all theories of folk-lore, all scientific 
philanthropy, sociology, ethnology. ' Science 
and the Savages,' * Sandals and Simplicity,' 
* Mr. H. G. Wells and the Giants,' are attractive 
headings, and the reader who plunges into the 
discussion without expecting a trap in the first 
sentence is apt to be caught in the sparkle of 
Mr. Chesterton's theories. Moreover, the author 
states a wrong idea so boldly and so surely that 
it takes a person of definite mind to contradict 
him. — as in these statements : 

'When the modern world praises its little Csesars, 
it talks of being strong and brave; but it does not 
seem to see the eternal paradox involved in the 
conjunction of these ideas. The strong cannot be 
brave; only the weak can be brave; and yet again 
in practise, only those who can be brave can be 
trusted, in time of doubt, to be strong.' 

'Men trust an ordinary man because they trust 
themselves. But men trust a great man because 
they do not trust themselves. And hence the wor- 
ship of great men always appears in times of weak- 
ness and cowardice; we never hear of great men 
until the time when all other men are small.' 

'There is one broad fact about the relations of 
Christianity and Paganism which is so simple and 
so clear that many will smile at it, but which is so 
important that all moderns forget it. The primary 
fact about Christianity and Paganism is that one 
came after the other.' 



Nothing could be more false than this last 
statement in tlie application which is made of 
it. Christianity was not a revolt or a develop- 
ment from Paganism, but from Judaism. That 
Pagans became Christians did not mean that 
Pagan virtues and ideals, transmuted into 
Christian virtues and ideals, were all of the 
world's spiritual history-. The gap, which is 
the largest part, is unaccounted for in Mr. 
Chesterton's argument. Even in lesser things 
he is careless about the use of evidence. In 
urging the beauty and the sjTnbolism of the 
ritual of religion and of chivalry against the 
ritual of social usage, he says : ' What can be 
more solemn and absurd, considered in the ab- 
stract, than symbolizing the existence of the 
other sex by taking off a portion of your cloth- 
ing and waving it in the air ? ' This is just 
the example that Mr. Chesterton would not 
have used, if he had remembered that taking 
off one's hat to a lady is a remnant of the days 
of chivalry when soldiers and knights doffed 
their helmets to signify a truce to hostilities 
in the presence of the opposite six. 

On the very next page, however, Mr. Ches- 
terton writes something so full of insight that 
his errors are easily forgiven. 

'It is idle to inveigh against cynics and material- 
ists. There are no cynics, there are no materialists. 
Every man is idealistic; only it so often happens 
that he has the wrong ideal. Every man is incur- 
ably sentimental; but, unfortunately, it is so often 
a false sentiment. When we talk, for instance, of 
some unscrupulous commercial figure, and say that 
he would do anything for money, we use quite an 
inaccurate expression, and we slander him very 
much. He would not do anything for money. He 
would do some things for money; he would sell his 
soul for money, for instance; and, as Mirabeau 
humorously said, he would be quite wise to "take 
money for muck." He would oppress humanity 
for money; but then it happens that humanity and 
the soul are not things that he believes in; they are 
not his ideals. But he has his own dim and deli- 
cate ideals; and he would not violate these for 
money. He would not drink out of the soup-tureen, 
for money. He would not wear his coat-tails in 
front, for money. He would not spread a report 
that he had softening of the brain, for money. In 
the actual practice of life we find, in the matter of 
ideals, exactly what we have already found in the 
matter of ritual. We find that while there is a 
perfectly genuine danger of fanaticism from the 
men who have unworldy ideals, the permanent and 
urgent danger of fanaticism is from the men who 
have worldly ideals.' 

So it is all through the book; one page 
amuses by its originality of conception and 
expression, the next provokes by its insecurity 
of argument, the third charms by its suggest- 
iveness. It is a book to be relished, not as a 
whole, but in snatches. With all its half-play- 
ful cynicism, it seems to be in the main sin- 
cere; and the opinions it so brilliantly ex- 
presses regarding some of the most interesting 
men and movements of the time are well worth 
attention. Edith J. R. Isaacs.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



John Knox, Hero or Villain?* 

That two volumes on John Knox, the latest 
of a long list of biographies of the great Scot- 
tish reformer, were published almost simul- 
taneously more than three hundred years after 
his death, shows the perennial interest that the 
world takes in the stem old leader of the Pur- 
itan forces in the Eeformation, If, as has been 
maintained, a test of greatness is the waning 
or the endurance of a man's reputation aft^r 
his death, certainly John Knox must be ranked 
as one of the greatest men of modern history. 
The wide divergence of judgment as to his 
character and his methods of controversy 
shown by these two sincere writers indicates 
that the differences in men's ways of looking 
at things that led to the bitter strifes of the re- 
ligious wars are fundamental to our human 
nature, and, though softened and christianized, 
still exist among us. 

Dr. Henry Cowan's Life of Knox is a 
straightforward biography, written from full 
knowledge by one who is in general sympathy 
with the Eeformer's methods and aims. The 
author's purpose, as expressed in his own words, 
is, in the limited space at his disposal, 'to de- 
scribe those portions of the career of Knox 
which are most likely to be of general interest; 
to place his life-work in its historical setting; 
to facilitate for students the consultation of 
original authorities ; and to present a picture of 
the Eeformer which, without concealing his in- 
firmities, would help to vindicate his enrollment 
alike among the foremost heroes of the Eefor- 
mation, and among the greatest and noblest of 
Scotsmen.' The book is thus not a judicial 
statement of the facts of Knox's career and of 
the many bitter controversies that filled it full ; 
the author is an advocate, but he is fair, digni- 
fied, and moderate in his advocacy of Knox's 
side of these questions and of the general course 
of his conduct as a Puritan leader. He does 
not gloss over the infirmities of his hero, — the 
coarse vituperation of his opponents, men or

revolting cruelty of the measures that he advo- 
cated in the heat of conflict. But he does give 
full weight to all that is favorable, and tries to 
account for all that is unfavorable, in the facts 
of Knox's life: this, indeed, is to be expected 
in one who undertakes to write a biography of 
a 'hero.' Dr. Cowan finds in Knox in abun- 
dant measure the hero-qualities of fearlessness,

in his defiance of those in authority who stood 
for what he would destroy, and in facing per- 
secution and danger for the sake of his con- 
victions ; of faith in God, in his own call to be 
God's servant, and in the ultimate triumph of 
what he firmly believed to be the divine cause; 
and of the courage and confidence, even in dis- 
aster, that would follow such faith. He finds 
also in him an intolerance which was greater 
than that of his intolerant age, uncharitable 
judgments of those whom he disliked, even 
condonation of assassinations that removed 
enemies of his cause; thousrh he would palliate 
somewhat these unlovely traits of his hero's 
character. 

Of chief importance Dr. Cnwnn ranks the 
great and enduring influence of Knox upon 
Scotland. He attributes largely to that influ- 
ence the opposition to royal despotism which 
culminated in a rebellion ' which history has 
vindicated and posterity has ratified;' the 
growth of an intelligent and earnest-minded 
middle-class, which Knox inspired with strong 
religious convictions and irnbnprl with a sense 
of national responsibility; the parochial-school 
organization, ' which during subsequent gen- 
erations, when most other countries lagged be- 
hind in this regard, provided for the poorest in 
the land a sound religious and secular educa- 
tion. We have only now, moreover, begun to 
realize some of the Eeformer's educational 
ideals, — the Calvinism that has done so much 
to shape Scottish character and thought, and 
that principle of Presbyterian church govern- 
ment that combined the recognition of the laity 
in the administration of the church with or- 
derly subordination of the whole church to one 
supreme authority, ' avoiding the dangers of 
both hierarchy and anarchy.' Dr. Cowan notes 
the wide spread of Knox's influence wherever 
Scotsmen have gone to live; also that he is the 
founder of the English and Irish Presbyterian 
Churches, and hence of the American, and is in 
some measure the preserver of English Protes- 
tantism. He quotes the English historian 
Froude as declaring that ' but for Knox, Mary 
Stuart would have bent Scotland to her pur- 
pose, and Scotland would have been the lever 
with which France and Spain would have 
worked upon England until Elizabeth had 
either been hurled from her throne or been con- 
strained to go back into the Egypt of Eoman- 
ism' ; and he attributes to the iniiuence of Knox 
that Covenanter spirit that played so large a 
part in the history of English liberty in the 
next century. The value of the book is en- 
hanced by a large number of valuable illustra- 
tions.

differs as widel}* from Dr. Cowan's as one biog- 
raphy can differ from another. In fact, Mr. 
Lang's book is not a biography at all; it is a 
controversial pamphlet of large size, the thesis 
of which is a quotation from *The Diurnal' 
under the date of Knox's death : ' John Knox, 
minister, deceased, who had, as was alleged, the 
most part of the blame of all the sorrows of 
Scotland since the slaughter of the late Car- 
dinal.' From the beginning to the end of his 
book, Mr. Lang employs all the resources of his 
literary art, irony, denunciation, special plead- 
ing, to discredit the great Eeformer. He at- 
tributes to him the principles of a Macchiavelli, 
and a prudence that led him to shun dangers to 
himself however ready he might be to denounce 
others who showed like prudence. He accuses 
Knox of numberless misstatements in his His- 
tory, extending even to the perversion of the 
facts of history to justify his acts and those 
of his party. On nearly every page is a fling at 
KJnox, the following being an example : ' Knox, 
as to the doctrine of " killing no murder," was 
a man of his time. But Knox, in telling the 
story of a murder which he approves, unhappily 
displays a glee imbecoming a reformer of the 
Church of Him who blamed St. Peter for his 
recourse to the sword. The very essence of 
Christianit}' is cast to the winds when KJnox 
utters his laughter over the murders or misfor- 
tunes of his opponents, yielding " to the strong 
propensity which he felt to indulge his vein of 
humour." Other good men rejoiced in the mur- 
der of an enemy, but KJnox chuckled.' This is 
not fair play, though it be sharp writing. It is 
to be admitted that Mr. Lang carries us with 
him in many of his attacks upon the consistency 
and spirit of the Reformer, but he himself 
* chuckles ' overmuch, and allows far too little 
for the spirit of the time that shapes the char- 
acter and thought of even its leaders and heroes.

not been earned by hard work, and pride in 
his own achievement makes him arrogant and 
overbearing. He has, nevertheless, an uneasy 
consciousness of social inferiority, and is at 
heart envious of the qualities of character that 
seem to go with gentle birth and breeding. 
Presently his son, upon whom he counts as his 
successor, returns from the University, and 
joins him in the management of the sawmill. 
But at this juncture a young woman appears, 
the product of the very traditions for which 
the father affects contempt, and the son 
promptly falls in love with her. Violent oppo- 
sition ensues; but the young man has inherited 
his father's strength of purpose, and refuses to 
submit. Eventually, the father loses his wealth 
through the ill-advised speculations of an asso- 
ciate, and he makes the discovery that the 
young woman really loves his son for himself, 
and not for his fortune. This reconciles the 
father to the marriage, and all ends happily for 
the young people concerned. This outline 
would seem to suggest a rather commonplace 
story treated in the conventional fashion; but 
it receives freshness of interest from its setting. 
For the scene is in the Carpathians, the father 
is a German exploiting the Polish forests, and 
the heroine is the daughter of an impoverished 
Polish nobleman. There is, moreover, much 
skill displayed in the delineation of character 
and situations alike, and the writer is thor- 
oughly familiar with her material. An English- 
woman long familiar with European society, 
and a novelist of experience, she has written 
a singularly interesting story. 

The anonymous author of ' The Martyrdom 
of an Empress ' has produced a series of over- 
grown and shapeless books, which deal with 
the society and politics of several European 
countries during the past quarter-century or 
more, and which retail a great deal of gossip 
in which fiction and fact are inextricably 
mingled. We have no knowledge of the iden- 
tity of this writer, but it is clear that the books 
are feminine productions, and that their author 
has had unusual opportunities for becoming in- 
timately acquainted with the aristocratic and 
diplomatic world of several countries. She also 
knows something of America, a knowledge 
which she chiefly displays by sprinkling her 
pages with cisatlantic colloquialisms, grotes- 
quely employed as a general rule. Of construc- 
tive art she seems to have no conception, and

her narratives are frankly amorphous. She has, 
nevertheless, a considerable wealth of interest- 
ing material to offer, and this in some measure 
compensates us for the literary defects of her 
work. Hitherto, her books have dealt largely 
with actualities, both as to persons and happen- 
ings; her latest production, ' The Trident ancT 
the Net, ' is distinguished from its predecessors 
by being wholly a work of fiction. The mean- 
ing of the title we have failed to fathom, for 
its symbolism is neither mythological nor ec- 
clesiastical, as might at first be imagined. The 
book is simply the life-story of a Breton noble- 
man, of violent passions and astounding in- 
ability to avoid the paths of obvious folly. It 
begins by depicting his unregulated childhood 
in Brittany, describes his later career as a de- 
serter from the French navy, a wanderer over 
many seas and lands, and a victim of a vulgar 
liaison, and ends in a squalid lodging-house of 
New York, where he lies desperately ill with 
pneumonia, and we do not know (or greatly 
care) whether he is going to live through it. 
The early Breton chapters are much the best 
part of the book, for in them the story has a 
genuine atmosphere; of the unreal melodrama 
that follows there is little to be said in the 
way of praise. We close it with a sense of 
exasperation at the recklessness of its composi- 
tion and its wasteful use of what might have 
been the material of an admirable work. 

The well-worn theme of Napoleon's last des- 
perate effort to retrieve his shattered fortunes 
is chosen by Mr. Max Pemberton for his latest 
romance. ' The Hundred Days ' begins just be- 
fore the Emperor's escape from Elba, and ends 
just after the defeat of Waterloo. We have the 
usual brave hero and captivating heroine, the 
one an Englishman in disfavor at home and 
living a secluded life in Fl-ance, the other an 
adventuress in the secret service of Napoleon. 
The story offers the conventional blend of fact 
with romantic fiction, is narrated in somewhat 
indistinct fashion, and proves but moderately 
exciting. 

' The Bandolero, ' like Mr. Paul Gwynne's 
earlier novels, is a romance of Spanish life. In 
writing of Spain, Mr. Gwynne is no casual out- 
sider, but an observer whose knowledge of his 
subject is extensive and intimate. He knows 
the life of town and country, the customs, the 
superstitions, and the folklore of the Spanish 
people. He is also by way of being a psycholo- 
gist in his interpretation of motives and modes 
of thought. This thoroughness of equipment, 
combined with a very pretty knack of compo- 
sition, and the ability to construct an interest- 
ing plot, makes these Spanish novels of his 
about the best of their kind. ' The Bandolero ' 



is a story of revenge, tempered in the end by 
something like Christian forgiveness. The 
brigand hero was once a valiant officer, but, 
under the pressure of a grievous wrong, he 
has become the enemy of society, and achieve(f 
a new kind of fame as the leader of a band of 
desperados. His story is, in short, that of Her- 
nani. Upon his wronger he takes the terrible 
revenge of kidnapping his only child, and con- 
cealing him so effectually from discovery that 
the child grows up to manhood as a peasant,' 
with no notion of his real station. But the 
brigand chieftain has also a girl-child of his- 
own, left in the same rustic care; and the two 
children, when they are old enough, become 
lovers, to the horror of the girl's father. His 
efforts to separate them prove futile, and in the 
end he becomes reconciled to their union, ceases 
to be an outlaw and enters the government ser- 
vice, almost forgives his ancient enemy, an<l 
dies in a fierce struggle with one of his old- 
time associates. The romance is thoroughly in- 
teresting, and has a considerable degree of lit- 
erary charm. 

Mr. George Gary Eggleston, who served as a 
Confederate soldier in the Civil War, has again 
turned to account his recollections of that con- 
flict in ' A Daughter of the South. ' The war 
does not exactly enter into the substance of 
this romance, but rather supplies a background; 
for the interest is almost wholly of a private 
character. The hero is a man engaged in the 
dangerous business of purchasing cotton in the 
blockaded South, and bringing it to the North- 
ern market. The heroine is a damsel in distress 
— a French girl from New Orleans — whom he 
finds hiding in a swamp upon the occasion of 
one of his expeditions, and rescues from star- 
vation and other perils. The story also deals 
with various forms of rascality on the part of 
the conscienceless money-makers who found in 
the war their opportunity to plunder and de- 
fraud. It embodies much curious information 
concerning this oygone period; but the author's 
language makes singular lapses into modernity, 
and his art must be described as crude. Never- 
theless, he tells a story of some interest, and 
keeps fairly in touch with reality. 

Mr. Harris Dickson, in ' The Eavanels, ' has 
given us an excellent piece of workmanship. 
The novel has both strength and character,^ 
besides a romantic plot of much dramatic in- 
terest. Mr. Dickson is a Mississippian, and a 
lawyer by profession; his story is of a feud orig- 
inating in the early days of reconstruction, and 
culminating a generation later in a mysterious 
murder. The trial of the hero fills something 
like two-thirds of the whole book; and here, as 
a Mississippi lawyer, the author is upon his own

ground. An ingenious explanation of the mys- 
tery is followed by the acquittal of the hero; 
and all ends happily. 

' The House of Cards ' is a novel written in 
an exasperating style, of which the following 
specimen may serve us for both example and 
introduction: ' True, Mr. Cards himself says 
something between his teeth as a big red devil 
of an automobile — hybrid word for a hybrid 
thing begotten and beloved of a hybrid brum- 
magem breed of sports — with a measly little 
parvid parvenu of an owner, and his fireman 
{chauffeur indeed ! I say '* fireman," and be 
burned to him!), snorts up and sets our horses 
to a dance. ' A book written in this jargon does 
not make easy reading, but the present produc- 
tion has so much pith that we are inclined to 
advise a struggle with its strained figures ancT 
thorny constructions. As our extract shows. 
Cards is a man's name, and not the mere inno- 
cent substantive that one might fancy, albeit 
there is a clear intention of allegory in the title. 
Briefly, the House of Cards is a colossal finan- 
cial edifice, its foundations laid during the Civil 
"War, when it was concerned with the negotia- 
tion of government loans, and its superstructure 
raised and rivetted during the forty years fol- 
lowing. Since the scene is Philadelphia, there 
is offered a suggestion — ^but only a suggestion 
— of the operations of the late Jay Cooke. The 
history of the House, as here presented, is 
curiously interwoven with the history of the 
Civil War, although that gigantic upheaval is 
used by the novelist as a motive for a somewhat 
cynical vein of moralizing, rather than as a 
source of picturesque material. In fact, there 
is very little story about the book, but instead 
a great deal of shrewd comment and incisive 
characterization. What it all leads up to is a 
rather impressive presentation of the Ameri- 
can society of to-day, based upon corrupt- 
politics and the domination of the great cor- 
porations. These conditions seem to be fairly 
fixed upon us, and the writer makes it clear 
that they are not easily to be swept away. He 
accepts them as an inevitable phase of our 
national development, and almost seems to con- 
done them. Yet there is an undercurrent of 
suggestion that selfish materialism is not to 
be the last word of our civilization, and that 
a sufficiently resolute onslaught will some day 
make the House of Cards topple over. This is 
what the hero stands for, — a figure barely 
sketched, but destined, in some dimly veiled 
future, to play the part of the stripling David 
to the Goliath of plutocracy. 

' The Boss of Little Arcady ' is so much 
better than anything that Mr. Wilson has here- 
tofore written that we are compelled to revise | 



our former very moderate estimate of his abili- 
ties. His Mormon story and his novel of theo- 
logical discussion were lumbering in their gait 
and deadly in their seriousness; but his new 
book has leisurely ease of movement and a 
humor that is simply captivating. It is a story 
of life in a countr}- town of central Illinois as 
far as it is a stor}-- at all — ^but its charm is al- 
most wholly one of incident, and of the genial 
delineation of village types. He who has once 
made their acquaintance will not readily forget 
J. Rodney Potts and Little Arcady's heroic ef- 
forts to dispense with his society; or the local 
editor, Solon Denny, and his suffering under the 
chastening hand of the severe lady from 
Boston; or Billy Durgin, the boy detective; or 
Clem, the faithful slave who refuses to be 
emancipated; or Miss Caroline from Virginia, 
'who causes such a fluttering of the village dove- 
cotes; or the philosophical biographer and his- 
torian, who contrives to attract our interest to 
himself no less than to these creatures of hi^ 
describing. And with all this prodigal and 
appealing humor there is a blend of humaniz- 
ing sentiment that is also very charming, and 
the combination is so deftly made that each of 
these two elements serves to heighten the other. 
We congratulate Mr. Wilson upon the new gait 
that he has now struck, and venture to predict 
that, if steadfastly pursued, it will lea!d him

The winning *A History of the Pacific North- 
of Oregon. west' (MacmiUan) is the title of 

a recent volume dealing with the 
establishment of American power beyond the 
Rocky Mountains. The literature of 'expansion' 
has been growing rapidly of late, and will doubt- 
less continue to grow for some time to come; 
unfortunately, however, this literature is often 
wanting in some of the qualities that we expect 
to find in true historv. Still, much excellent 
work has been done in this field, and it is a pleas- 
ure to note that the work before us belongs to 
this class. The author, Professor Joseph Schafer, 
of the University of Oregon, has for some years 
been engaged in studying the historical materials 
of the Pacific States, and in this work he tells 
the early history of the Oregon country. With 
the later history of this region— the development 
of its vast resources during the last half-centurj' 
and the political careers of the various States 
carved out of it— the author is not much con- 
cerned; his purpose is to give a clear and read- 
able account of how the valley of the Columbia 
River was won for the American Republic and 
for American civilization. Professor Schafer goes 
back to the memorable day when Balboa first saw

the South Sea, discusses the great interest that 
this discovery aroused in the European mind, and 
traces the progress of Spanish exploration as for 
a hundred and fifty years it slowly crept up the 
Pacific shore. This is followed by an account of 
the fur-trade and of the efforts of England and 
our own country to come into possession of this 
far Northwest. The Oregon question on its diplo- 
matic side is treated in a brief but lucid fashion, 
the disputed noints being discussed as fully as 
could be expected in a popular narrative. After 
reviewing the efforts of the American pioneers 
and missionaries to establish, themselves on the 
Columbia River in the two decades following 
1820, the author gives us a vivid account of the 
'great immigration' that began about 1842. To 
our knowledge of this movement Professor 
Schafer has made some important contributions, 
his research having brought to light a number of 
hitherto unknown sources. When the authpr 
records the final settlement with Great Britain 
in 1846, and the organization of a territorial gov- 
ernment at Oregon City three years later, his 
purpose is accomplished ; but he has added several 
interesting chapters dealing with the political 
and material progress of the region since that 
date. The work makes a volume of about three 
hundred pages, and is provided with a number of 
excellent maps and suggestive illustrations. A 
reading of it leaves the impression that it is the 
work of one who knows his field and whose con- 
clusions may be relied upon. The author evidently 
believes that economy in style and accuracy in 
statement are virtues to be practised even when 
writing primarily for young readers. 



Having aired his prejudices 
the Emerald Isle, against the dwellers beyond the 

Tweed, Mr. T. W. H. Crosland, 
author of 'The Unspeakable Scot,' now takes in 
hand his neighbors across St. Greorge's Channel, 
in a companion volume which he entitles 'The 
Wild Irishman' (Appleton). Between his out- 
spoken dislike of the Scotch and his patronizing 
and even contemptuous friendliness for the Irish, 
there is little to choose. Probably most Irishmen 
would prefer his honest enmity. Such chapters 
as those on 'Pigs,' 'Potatoes,' 'Dirt,' 'Whisky,' 
and ' Blarney, ' are not exactly calculated to make 
the natives of Erin enthusiastic in the writer's 
praise. As the utterance of a comparatively 
young man, the book lacks that degree of modest 
hesitancy and restraint so befitting an author 
gifted with considerably less than omniscience, 
but so seldom found except in union with really 
large attainments which might afford — were that 
ever permissible to fallible mortals— to be dog- 
matic. Of sweetness and light, of literary charm, 
even of careful writing and evidence of laborious 
endeavor to do one's best and to polish one's 
stanza, the book has little. A single short sen- 
tence, on Home Rule, will help to show in what 
key the work is pitched. We are told that 'any 
man who believes for one moment that it will be 
of the smallest benefit to Ireland is just a fool.' 
Perhaps the least praiseworthy feature of the 
volume is its frequent and uncalled-for slaps at 



the Scotch— as if to illustrate anew that forgive- 
ness to the injured does belong, but they ne'er 
pardon who have done the wrong. For example, 
we read that 'he who drinks Scotch whisky be- 
comes as the Scotch people, who, as all men know,, 
are a hectoring, swaggering, dull-witted, bandy- 
legged, plantigrade folk' and—. But vituperation 
is already too much indulged in, without receiv- 
ing the encouragement of quotation. Two chap- 
ters of some literary interest the book does con- 
tain, on Tom Moore and Mr. W. B. Yeats. 
The tracing of Mr. Yeats 's so-called Celtic qual- 
ity to the influence of Blake, who was not a Celt 
at all, furnishes good reading. An occasional 
Carlylism in Mr. Crosland 's pages is not unpleas- 
ing, except that the use of the adjunct instead of 
the possessive pronoun is hardly a graceful triek 
if often repeated. Colloquialisms abound; nor is 
careless spelling absent, as ' empyricism, ' and 
'practise' as a noun (three times) ; nor are words 
always used in their accepted sense, as 'blarney 
of the vituperative order. ' Among terms of little 
dignity or somewhat unusual may be noted 
'jarvey,' 'poteen,' 'weeniest,' and the verb 'ta 
keen.' Contemporary humorists are labelled 
groupwise as 'a sorry and indifferent company, *" 
and a 'squad of awkward witlings.'! What of 
contemporary satirists ?

Legendary, Picturesque' (Putnam) comes as one 
of a group of books on the great rivers of North 
America that already includes the Hudson and 
the Colorado, and is to include the Connecticut 
and probably the Mississippi. In the first two 
hundred of its three hundred and fifty pages, the 
author gives a sketch of the history of the St. 
Lawrence,— which means in effect that of the 
French in British North America, since the great 
river was their highroad, and along its banks are 
the spots that mark the critical points of that his- 
tory. Mr. Browne does not lay claim to actual 
original investigation, but he has read a goodly 
number of authorities, including original docu- 
ments, and has written a very acceptable brief 
history, although one could dispense with his 
somewhat patronizing attitude toward La Salle on 
page 148. To those who are not familiar with 
the thrilling story of the French in North Amer- 
ica, this portion will be necessary for a thorough 
understanding of what follows; those who are so- 
familiar will doubtless find it profitable to renew 
their knowledge. With Chapter XV. Mr. Browne 
begins a trip up the river, starting with Tadousac 
at the mouth of the 'mysterious' Saguenay, and 
giving a chapter to its picturesque charms and his- 
toric memories; then upward, passing Riviere du 
Loup, Mun-ay Bay, Cartier's Isle of Bacchus, Ste. 
Anne de Baupre of blessed memory and modern 
pilgrimages, and the beautiful falls of Montmor- 
ency, and finally reaching Quebec, to which two 
chapters are given, describing notable landmarks

and relating connected facts and legends. The 
next chapter describes the Indian settlements and 
the peasant population, with its tj'pes and festi- 
vals, then on past a 'region of rivers' to Montreal, 
which the author calls Canada's 'White City.* 
Here considerable space is devoted to the famous 
Chateau de Ramezay, that old-time relic which 
has been turned into a museum and portrait gal- 
lery, and in which alone one could make a consid- 
erable study of Canadian histoiy. The two re- 
maining chapters are devoted to climbing the rapids 
and the trip through the Thousand Islands, with 
accompanying stories, true or legendary. To some 
readers, more physical description of the noble St. 
Lawrence would be acceptable ; but within its lim- 
its the book is satisfactory', and a good map adds 
to its value. The volume is rather too large to 
accompany one's travels; but it might be read 
with advantage as a preliminary to a voyage, or 
afterwards for the pleasures of retrospect and the 
purpose of fixing one's associations. Still, we 
would suggest a pocket edition that could find a 
place in the traveller's suit-case.

teller, the Hon. Frederick Leveson 
Gower's 'Bygone Years' (Button) admirably does 
this. With no manifest effort, no straining for 
effect, no attempt to raise a laugh, he suffers his 
pen to record such items of general human inter- 
est as have been picked up by him during a long 
life of contemplative observation rather than of 
strenuous action. Good humor, good sense, good 
birth and breeding, an entire absence of airs and 
pretensions, these are among the qualities that 
commend him to the reader. An apologetic pre- 
face intimates that it is more to the urgency of 
friends than to initiative on the writer's part that 
we are indebted for these octogenarian gleanings. 
In a happily quoted couplet from Moore, the firet 
line, 'I give thee all, I can no more,' is mis- 
punctuated, the comma following 'can,' to the ruin 
of the sense. Xow, in his eighty-sixth year, the 
author tells us he finds it hard to recall the main 
outlines of his life, although imimpoftant inci- 
dents remain in mind. Hence we are treated, not 
to history or biography, and luckily not to poli- 
tics, but to a variety of entertaining and never 
malevolent personalia and society anecdotes, to- 
gether with notes on Spain, India, and Russia, 
from journals of early travel. Though a barrister 
by profession, the author modestly doubts whether 
he ever could have earned his bread in his calling. 
His first instructor in the law neglected the in- 
tricacies of Coke upon Littleton to listen to his 
pupil's stories of society life; which indicates that 
even as a youth he was no mean raconteur. But 
that society life is, after all, weariness and vanity, 
is illustrated by a reminiscence of the Princess 
Lieven, who, always in the whirl of fashion, suf- 
fered from an intense boredom that almost 
amounted to a disease. If no one called of an 
afternoon, she would roll on the floor from 
tedium. Dreading to travel alone from CalaLs to 
Paris, she once offered a seat in her carriage to a 
chance clerg>Tnan, who, however, talked so inces- 
santly as fairly to drive her wild. Of Ladv Hol- 



land and her set, some good stories are told. De- 
spite her despotic humor, young G'ower discemea 
her better qualities, and as seen through his eyes 
she is more amiable than one had imagined. To 
supplement the slender autobiographic informa- 
tion contained in the book, it may be worth while 
to note here some of the author's family connec- 
tions. The first Earl of Granville was his father, 
the second Earl his brother. Lady Georgiana Ful- 
lerton was his sister, and the sixth Duke of Devon- 
shire his maternal uncle. Of Leveson and Gower 
afiftnities and consanguinities, hyphenated and 
otherwise, the tale would be a long one. The au- 
thor was in Parliament almost continuously from 
1847 to 1885. 

Local history The number of books of local his- 
of an ancient tory in England is increasing as 
English town. interest in antiquarian lore is 
deepening and facilities for research are extend- 
ing. It is not usually the importance of the 
locality that influences its selection for historical 
treatment. Of many subjects of local histories 
the question might be asked, Why should anyone 
trouble to write a book about a place of which 
few have even heard? But it is often in the 
most out-of-the-way place that the rarest his- 
torical treasures are preserved, and that succes- 
sive periods of growth are so well demonstrated 
as to illustrate the historical development of 
other like unimportant localities, which in the 
aergregate go a long way toward the making of 
England. This might be said of the ancient towiv 
of Pickering in Yorkshire, which is little known 
even to English peoole. Stow states, on the author- 
ity of 'divers writers,' that the town was built 
in the year 270 B. C, but evidence is not wanting 
that settlement was made on the site or in the 
neighborhood at an infinitely earlier period. Yet 
it preserves in its outward features and in its 
written records enough characteristics of the 
various phases of English geological, political, 
religious, and economic history, to illustrate 'The 
Evolution of an English Town,' which is the title 
Mr. Grordon Home gives to his story of Pickering 
from pre-historic times up to the present year 
(Dutton). In going back to Palaeolithic and 
Pre-Glacial times, in tracing the changes that 
have taken place in the physical features of the 
locality in the Lesser Ice Age, in collating evi- 
dence of the occupation of the district by neoliths 
and men of the Bronze Age, and in the chapters 
on the various periods of historic times, the book 
furnishes a pleasing type of local history to which 
other essays in that field will do well to conform. 
But while Pickering is thus made to serve as a 
typical English town, it has some very interest- 
ing individual characteristics,— as, for example, 
its old church with curious paintings of about 
the middle of the fifteenth century upon the 
clere-story walls. Some of the folk-lore and folk- 
customs narrated are peculiar to the neighbor- 
hood, and these give to the book an interest far 
wider than that of the local antiquary. The illus- 
trations, interesting from an archaeolosrical stand- 
point, scarcely seem to justify the claim of the 
text that the vicinity of Pickering is picturesque 
beyond the average of English sceneiy.

THE DIAl. 



[Oct. 1, 



, ^, ^ To those of us who, with Steven- 
a schoolmaster, son, pray for the quiet mind, 'The 
Upton Letters' (Putnam) by 'T.B.' 
are a help in that direction. Simple and nat- 
ural, sane and human, these reflective utterances 
on literary, moral, and educational themes, and 
on the commonplaces of daily life, have the charm 
that belongs to the genuine expression of a good 
mind and heart. They are the letters of a mas- 
ter in an English public school to a friend ('Her- 
bert') sojourning in Madeira for his health; and 
they run through the year 1904, being brought to 
a close by the friend 's death. They are now pub- 
lished at the request of Herbert's widow. Reality 
breathes in every line, and spontaneity animates 
every syllable. Personal reminiscence and anec- 
dote abound, A few lines indicating the writer's 
admiration of Newman 's prose style are quotable, 
'I have been going through Newman's "Apolo- 
gia" for the twentieth time,' he writes, 'and as 
usual have fallen completely under the magical 
spell of that incomparable style ; its perfect lucid- 
ity, showing the very shape of the thought within, 
its simplicity (not, in Newman's case, I think, 
the result of labour, but of pure instinctive 
grace), its appositeness, its dignity, its music. I 
oscillate between supreme contentment as a reader 
and envious despair as a writer; it fills one's 
mind up slowly and richly, as honey fills a vase 
from some gently tilted bowl. , , . I have no 
sympathy with the intellectual attitude it reveals, 
but as Roderick Hudson says, I don 't always heed 
the sense.' To be able thus to admire Newman's 
art speaks something for the lettei'- writer 's own 
powers as an artist in words. The little volume 
will create no sensation (heaven forbid!), but it 
will greatly content a choice few among the read- 
ers of books. 

New text-book of The enthusiasm of the translator 
the elements of for M. Levasseur's 'Elements of 
political economy. Political Economy ' will hardly be 
shared by the student who attempts to use the 
book as a text, or by the advanced economist who 
tries to extract M. Levasseur's theories of the 
science. Many leading economic questions are 
discussed with the clearness and comprehension 
which have given M. Levasseur his acknowledged 
place among French teachers of political econ- 
omy. But the form of the book, and the sequence 
of subjects, are unfortunate. For example, much 
space is devoted to an interesting and enlighten- 
ing account of association in industry, the trade 
guilds of Europe, the modern trades unions, and 
the relation of both to the principle of freedom 
of contract; but the usefulness of this review is 
nullified by its appearance in the chapter on ' The 
Production of Wealth,' almost before mention is 
made of 'Distribution and Consumption.' In the 
same way, Rent, Interest, Socialism, Cooperation, 
and related subjects, are discussed in the chapter 
on Distribution, before the theories of Exchange 
and Consumption are explained. This lack of 
logical treatment renders M. Levasseur's book 
almost incomprehensible to the beginner, for 
whom it is evidently intended. ('Elements of 
Political Economy': Macmillan.) 



Goidtcin Smith's The reprint of Mr, Goldwiu 
memories of Smith's magazine article, 'Mv 

Gladstone. Memory of Gladstone' (imported 

by A. Wessels Company), makes a very attractive 
little voliuue of some eighty-five pages of large 
type. The characterization here presented does 
not pui-port to be complete, but is rather a run- 
ning account of the more important episodes in 
Gladstone's career, Avith the author's judgment 
upon such activities. The essay was in the first 
instance drawn out by way of commentary— hard- 
ly criticism— on Morley's Life of Gladstone. Thus 
the principal interest for the reader, aside from 
his pleasure in the clear-cut style of the essay 
itself, will be in regard to those points in which 
Mr, Goldwin Smith differs from the biographer. 
Of these, the most important relates to Glad- 
stone's Home Rule policy for Ireland; and upon 
it the author bases much of his criticism 
of Gladstone's title to unerring statecraft. And 
while the words of neither the essayist nor Mv. 
Morley will be accepted as final on this subject, 
for both are in a sense partisans, such an analysis 
as that offered by Mr, Goldwin Smith is well 
worth study, and is also pleasant reading. 



XOTES. 



Once more we have from the Macmillan Co. their 
pretty holiday 'Book of Old English Love-Songs,' 
as edited by Dr. H. W. Mabie, and illustrated by 
Mr. George "Wharton Edwards. 

A full account of the principles and progress of 
'Italian Architecture,' by Mr. J. Wood Brown, is 
published by the Messrs, Scribner in their 'Lang- 
ham Series' of art monographs. 

Captain A. T, Mahan's two-volume work entitled 
'Sea Power in its Eelations to the War of 1812,' 
one of the most important historical books of the 
season, will be issued this month by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. 

Two Fall publications of the Messrs. Putnam not 
heretofore announced are Mr, Henry Wellington 
Wack's account of rambles and voyages along the 
river Thames, entitled 'In Thamesland,' and Dr. 
Herman Knapp's biography of Hermann von Helm- 
holtz, 

Messrs. E. P, Button & Co, publish in their 'Eng- 
lish Library' a new edition of Trench's 'English 
Past and Present,' edited by Dr, A, Smythe Pal- 
mer, and a small treatise on ' Punctuation: Its Prin- 
ciples and Practice,' by Messrs, T, F. and M. F. A. 
Husband, 

A concise account of South Polar explorations and 
discoveries, from earliest times to the present day, 
has been prepared by Br, H, E, Mill, and will be 
published shortly by the Frederick A, Stokes Co. 
in an illustrated volume entitled 'The Siege of the 
South Pole,' 

' A Bibliography of Works in English on Playing 
Cards and Gaming,' compiled by Mr, Frederic 
Jessel, is published by Messrs, Longmans, Green, 
& Co, There are upwards of seventeen hundred en- 
tries, making a handsomely-printed volume of over 
three hundred pages. 

The anthropological series of publications of the 
Field Columbian Museum has just been enlarged 
by the following issues: 'The Cheyenne,' an ex- 
tensive monograph by Mr. George A. Borsey; 'The 



1905.] 



THE DIAL

Traditions of the Hopi,' by Mr. H. E. Voth; 'Hopi 
Proper Names,' by Mr. Voth; and 'Oraibi Natal 
Customs and Ceremonies,' also by Mr. Voth. The 
last three of these monographs are numbered among 
the results of the Stanley McCormick Hopi expedi- 
tion. 

'Intentions' is the title given to a volume of 
Essays by Oscar Wilde, just published by the Messrs. 
Brentano. It comprises the following titles: ' The 
Decay of Lying,' 'Pen, Pencil, and Poison,' 'The 
Critic as Artist, ' and ' The Truth of Masks. ' There 
is a frontispiece portrait of the author. 

To the ' Athenaeum Press Series' of Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. we now have added a volume of ' Selected 
Essays of Henry Fielding,' edited by Mr. Gordon 
HaU Gerould, and a volume of 'Selections from 
the Writings of Joseph Addison,' edited by Pro- 
fessor Barrett Wendell and Mr. Chester Noyes 
Greenough. 

'The Art and Craft of the Author' is the title 
of a new handbook on literary work, by Mr. C. E. 
Heisch, which is to be published during this au- 
tumn by Mr. Elliot Stock of London. Its purpose 
will be to explain the principles which should guide 
the author, the objects he should keep in view, and 
the methods of carrying these out, rather than to 
supply a guide to the technicalities of literary work. 

The latest addition to Mr. Henry Frowde's series 
of 'Oxford Poets' is a reprint of Mr. Thomas Hut- 
chinson's recent edition of Shelley, now printed on 
smaller-sized paper and issued at a much lower 
price. Including as it does material never before 
printed in any edition of the poems, this is per- 
haps the most desirable edition of Shelley to be 
had, — certainly it is the best moderate-priced edi- 
tion. 

Mr. Charles Mosley, editor of * Nature Study', 
has arranged an edition of White's ' Selborne ' for 
students, in which the whole of the Letters are 
classified under subjects, thus giving the reader un- 
der one head all that the naturalist wrote on each 
topic. As the subjects will be arranged alphabet- 
ically the work will be one of reference as well as 
for reading consecutively. Mr. Elliot Stock of Lon- 
don is to publish the book during the coming season. 

In addition to their new ' Wessex ' edition of Mr. 
Hardy's novels, the Messrs. Harper are preparing 
a thirty-volume Dickens, fully illustrated with all of 
the old drawings. They also announce a new 
Shakespeare in eight volumes, illustrated in photo- 
gravure, and containing many special features, such 
as a full selection of the best annotations, an essay 
by Cradock on the learning of Shakespeare, and Dr. 
Johnson's famous Introduction. 

The 'Fifty Piano Compositions' by Schumann 
that have been selected and edited by Mr. Xaver 
Scharwenka make an important addition to the 
'Musician's Library' of Messrs. Oliver Ditson & 
Co. The volume has the usual portrait, critical 
essay, and brief bibliography. Our only quarrel 
with the selection is that the 'Fantasia, op. 17' is 
represented by the first section only, and that but a 
single number is given from the ' Faschingschwank 
aus Wien.' 

The Oxford University Press announces for pub- 
lication during the present season a collotype re- 
production, with introductions by Mr. Sidney Lee, 
of the earliest editions of that portion of Shake- 
speare's work which found no place in the First 
Folio, namely: 'Pericles' and the four volumes of 
Poems. The edition will be limited to one thou- 
sand copies. Among other works of marked lit- 
erary interest, the same firm have in press a col- 
lection of 'Critical Essavs of the Seventeenth Cen- 



tury,' in three volumes, edited by Mr. J. E. Spin- 
gam; a three-volume edition of Johnson's 'Lives of 
the Poets,' edited by the late G. Birkbeck Hill; 
'The Lyrical Poems of Blake,' edited by Mr. John 
Sampson, M.A.; 'The Plays and Poems of Eobert 
Greene,' edited by Mr. J. Churton Collins, in two 
volumes; and the four concluding volumes in Mrs. 
Paget Toynbee's elaborate edition of Horace Wal- 
pole's Letters. 

Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles, one of the most 
promising of the younger American poets, died at his 
home near Boston on the 19th of last month. Mr. 
Knowles was bom in Lawrence, Mass., in 1869. 
After graduating from Harvard, in 1896, he became 
associated with the literary departments of several 
prominent publishing firms of Boston, being at the 
time of his death literary adviser to Messrs. Dana 
Estes & Co. Mr. Knowles had written two volumes 
of verse, 'On Life's Stairway,' published in 1900, 
and 'Love Triumphant,' published a year ago.

include the best known sociologists in Europe and America, who 
keep its readers fully abreast of the times upon all debatable social 
relations — political, economical, educational, and religious — as 
well as upon those problems of social amelioration which are popu- 
larly and erroneously supposed to constitute the sole scope of 
sociology.

many combinations of this journal with books and other periodicals. 
The book list includes such works as Howard's Matrimonial 
Institutions, Ross' Social Control and Foundations of

THE LOVE POEMS 

JOHN DONNE 

EDITED BY 

CHARLES ELIOT NORTON 


The fine and careful editing which Mr. 
Norton has given to this volume reveals 
the excellences of Donne's love poetry in a 
new and clear light. Nothing of enduring 
value has been left out, and the volume 
serves to show how Donne's poetry was 
always best when most purely impassioned.

PUTNAM^S NEW BOOKS 

The Life of Charles Lamb 

By E. V. LUCAS, Editor of " The Works and Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb." 

Two Volumes, Svo, with 50 Illustrations, net $6.00. 

This work, by the greatest authority on the Lambs, represents the first attempt since Talfourd's day to write the life 
of Charles and Mary Lamb in full. The new material that has come to light would alone justify a new biography, 
apart from the removal of many of the restrictions which prevented Lamb's first biographer from quoting freely from 
the letters and from entering fully into all the particulars of his friend's life and associations. 



Portraits of the Eighteenth 
Century 

Historic and Literary 

By C. A. SAINTE-BEUVE 

Translated by K. P. Wormeley and G. B. Ives 

Two Parts, Svo, 30 Illustrations, net $5.00. 

The quality, the discernment, and balance, intuitive 
grasp of essentials, the grace, force, and justice of Sainte- 
Beuve's critical work have placed him in the front rank 
— perhaps, it would be better to say, have given him a 
place alone and unapproachable in the history of critical 
literature. 



Louis XIV. and 
La Grande Mademoiselle 

By ARVEDE BARINE 

Authorized Version. Svo, Illustrated, net $3.00. 

All French history is fascinating, but few episodes 
are more fascinating than the kaleidoscopic career of 
La Grande Mademoiselle, a relation of Louis XIII. 
through both parents, and the richest heiress in France, 
who aspired to be an empress, a political power, and a 
nun. Her memoirs give unique and valuable pictures 
of life at the court of Anne of Austria, and of the Wars 
of the Fronde, in which this strange woman played so 
remarkable a part. 



The Life of Goethe 



By ALBERT BIEI^CHOWSKY. Translated by W. A. Cooper. 

Three Volumes, Fully Illustrated, Large Svo, net. 

Dr. Bielschowsky was acknowledged as the foremost authority on Goethe, and it is generally conceded that this is 
the most important life of Goethe, from the standpoint of scholarship, sympathetic interpretation, and literary art 
— in fact the most important biography of any man written in Germany for many years. 



The Development of the 
European Nations 

1870-1900 

By J. HOLLAND-ROSE 
Two Volumes, Svo, with Maps. 
" A discussion by a scholar of authority of those events 
which had a distinct formative influence upon the devel- 
opment of European states during the latter part of the 
nineteenth century, a period remarkable because of the 
great progress made by the peoples of Europe in their 
effort to secure a larger measure of political freedom 
for the individual and the legitimate development of 
the nation."

Four Volumes. Each Complete in Itself and sold sepa- 
rately, with Portraits; each, net $3.75. 
Vol. 1. France in 1870-1873 
Vol. II. France in 1874-1878 

The history of contemporary Europe is for the first 
time definitely focused in this important work. It con- 
tains new documents and new explanations of diplomatic 
problems, and is, indeed, a record of the inner diplomacy 
of the great powers of Europe during the last thirty 
years.

A bright, readable description of life in a fascinating

entertaining, captivating, — just the kind for a book 
which is not at all statistical, political, or controversial. 



5. Philippine Life in Town and Country

Mr. Le Roy is eminently fitted to write on the Philippines. 
He was several years connected with the Department of

A COMPLETE SET OF 
SHAKESPEARE for $8.00 



Pocket form, 40 vols., cloth; each with a new Critical and 
Historical Introduction by GEORGE Brandes, who is per- 
haps the greatest of modern Shakespeare scholars. Printed 
from neiv plates^ with photogravure frontispiete in each volume. 

The Brandes Shakespeare 

No other handy volume set of Shakespeare's works equals this 
new edition either in quality or price. George Brandes, the dis- 
tinguished Danish critic, furnishes an analytic and historical intro- 
duction to each play; and a photogravure of a famous actor or 
actress in costume forms a frontispiece for each volume. There 
are forty volumes in the set, each ^Ji'^^ inches. Large type 
is used on good paper — and the bindings, in either green 
cloth or deep red leather, are both artistic and serviceable. 

The Set in a box, cloth ^ $8.00 net; Leather, $16.00 net. Sent prepaid on receipt of price. 
A CONSENSUS OF CRITICAL OPINIONS 



William Archer: The edition is indeed a tri- 
umph, extraordinarily attractive and readable. It 
certainly desen'es the widest popularity. It is a 
service at once to the poet and to the public to bring 
out such an edition at such a price. 

Dr. Brander Matthews: Especially note- 
worthy is the extraordinary cheapness of the edition; 
the volumes are shapely and seemly, convenient for 
the pocket and yet not trying to the eyes. 

Bishop Vincent : I wish that every minister of 
the Gospel, and aspiring layman as well, might 
see the wisdom of putting on his shelves this most 
convenient and charming little Shakespearean Library'. 
. . . It is a temptation to the busiest person to read 
a few pages of Shakespeare ever)' day. 

The Review of Reviews: You will not be 
able to resist the temptation of buying this cheap 
and damty edition of the plays of Shakespeare. 



Dr. Max Nordau : You have surpassed your- 
self. It is a marvellous edition. The get-up is won- 
derful, and the text the best available. 

Austin Dobson : These are eminently desirable 
little books, light to handle, pleasant to look at, 
irreproachably prefaced. 

•■ Good paper, binding — plain to read — 
What nMds my Shakespeare now, indeed ? " 

I hope they may have every success. 

Edmund QoSSe : Although Shakespeare has 
been reprinted in a thousand forms, it seems to me 
that these little volumes present the plays in the 
most graceful and delicate way that has hitherto 
been achieved. 

A. C. Swinburne : Mr. Watts-Dunton desires 
me to say how thoroughly he agrees with my esti- 
mation of your little books' unrivaled beauty.

THE GREEK LOVE OF DETAIL, 

The crocodile of the Nile, Herodotus tells ns 
in that admirable Second Book of his, has pig's 
eyes, tusk-like teeth, and a dorsal armor of very 
strong scales; he also adds that it is the only 
animal having no tongue and moving its upper 
instead of its under jaw, and that leeches infest 
its mouth, which it gladly opens for a certain 
bird resembling the plover to walk in and feast 
on the troublesome parasites — a service so grate- 
ful to the hideous reptile that it holds ajar those 
huge jaws, which could easily make match- 
wood of a fishing boat, until the bird has walked 
out again unharmed. This vividly recalls tiie 
picture, in the old natural-history books, of a 
crocodile with its upper jaw, and in fact the 
whole cerebral region, tilted at an angle of 
nearly forty-five degrees with the lower jaw, 
which rests on the ground, while a small bird 
promenades the oral cavity (a veritable bonne 
hovche for the feathered feaster) with much 
apparent contentment. 

All these details are characteristic of the 
Greek historian's inquiring and observing 
genius, but two of them also illustrate his occa- 
sional too ready acceptance of that which is 
curious and striking, and which, for the inter- 
est of his narrative, ought to be true if it is not. 
As for the leeches, and the bird which alone of 
animate beings is the ugly monster's friend, and 
which Herodotus calls the ' trochilos,' later re- 
searches have proved the Halicamassian trav- 
eller to be in the right. The parasite — * bdella ' 
is its Greek name — has been identified with the 
'timnatis nilotica,' and the bird, which the 
Arabs of to-day call ' siksak,' is inferred to be 
the 'pluvianus aegyptius.' But concerning the 
anomalous absence of a tongue and the excep- 
tional hinging of the jaws, the historian's eyes 
deceived him. His account of the matter is 
very interesting, but unhappily not true. Mod- 
em naturalists have discovered a tongue to the 
animal, a thick fleshy growth, attached, as they 
tell us, very far back in the throat, and not so 
much in evidence as the unruly member of some 
higher forms of vertebrates. And the lower 
jaw, being prolonged backward beyond the skull, 
gives to the reptile's yawn a generous ampli- 
tude, and in some way conveys the impression 
that the upper and less considerable blade of 
these enormous shears is the moving part. 

But exceptions only prove the rule, and the 
Ionic traveller's fondness for graphic detail has 



228 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



long been recognized as something far different 
from the ordinary sight-seer's craving for nov- 
elty. No one will severely blame Herodotus for 
not pushing his study of saurian anatomy to a 
point that might have robbed us of his book be- 
fore the first page was written. He redeems 
his slight error of detail by going on to tell how 
the reptile is hunted, — a curious method, sub- 
stantially the same as that still in vogue on the 
banks of the Nile. Another small descriptive 
item in this Egyptian narrative chanced to ap- 
peal to the present writer with a certain vivid- 
ness and reality. In his account of the festival 
called the 'lighting of the lamps,' periodically 
celebrated at Sais, and in fact throughout 
Egypt, Herodotus says the lamps were filled 
with oil and salt, the wick floating on the sur- 
face and the lamps burning all night. The 
domestic column of a recent newspaper contains 
a paragraph advising housewives to put a little 
salt in their lamps to make them burn more 
brightly; which goes to demonstrate again that 
there is nothing new under the sun. 

De Quincey once styled Herodotus ' the Frois- 
sart of Antiquity,' but later admitted that he 
had done the earlier writer an injustice; for 
Froissart he declares to be ' little else than an 
historian, whereas Herodotus is the counterpart 
of some ideal Pandora, by the universality of 
his accomplishments.' And the English essay- 
ist proceeds to name some of the Greek histo- 
rian's many excellences. His approximate accu- 
racy in giving dimensions and distances in 
Egypt, notwithstanding the crudeness of his in- 
struments of measurement, De Quincey consid- 
ers *all but marvellous' ; and he warmly admires 
his description of that ancient land and its in- 
habitants. Judged as ' an exploratory traveller,' 
he continues, in an essay that has not yet ceased 
to be good reading, 'and as a naturalist, who 
had to break ground for the earliest entrench- 
ments in these new functions of knowledge, we 
do not scruple to say that, mutatis mutandis 
and concessis concedendis, Herodotus has the 
separate qualifications of the two men whom we 
would select by preference as the most distin- 
guished among Christian traveller-naturalists; 
he has the universality of the Prussian Hum- 
boldt, and he has the picturesque fidelity to na- 
ture of the English Dampier — of whom the 
last was a simple self-educated seaman, but 
strong-minded by nature, austerely accurate 
through his moral reverence for truth, and zeal- 
ous in pursuit of knowledge, to an excess which 
raises him to a level with the noble Greek. Dam- 
pier, when in the last stage of exhaustion from 
a malignant dysentery, unable to stand upright, 
and surrounded by perils in a land of infidels, 
crawled on his hands and feet to verify some 
fact of natural history, under the blazing fore- 



noon of the tropics ; and Herodotus, having no 
motive but his own inexhaustible thirst of 
knowledge, embarked on a separate voyage, 
fraught with hardships, toward a chance of 
clearing up what seemed a difficulty of some im- 
portance in deducing the religious mythology 
of his country.' 

To pass now to a Greek historian of the suc- 
ceeding generation and of another dialect, even 
the monotonous details of stages and parasangs 
that used to make Xenophon's retreating Ten 
Thousand so tiresome a company of tired sol- 
diers to our schoolboy minds, may come back in 
later life as not unpleasing bits of realism, ac- 
ceptable for their very dulness, their rigid ad- 
herence to the hard facts of that stern struggle 
for a sight of the sea, with its cheering promise 
of home and friends. So, too, the Catalogue of 
Ships in the ' Iliad,' a passage of 266 lines that 
used to be skipped in the classroom as not gram- 
matically instructive, contributes by its very 
monotony to complete one's mental image of 
those primitive galleys hastening in squadrons 
across the ^gaean and laden with warriors that 
are to do battle ' far on the ringing plains of 
windy Troy.' The description of the shield of 
Achilles is another bit of detail, tiresome prob- 
ably to the learner, but afterward recognized 
as a necessary part of the poem. As Professor 
Butcher has well said, poetry was not for the 
Greeks, as it so often is for us, an escape from 
reality, a refuge from world-weariness; and he 
quotes Strabo's remark that 'to construct an 
empty teratology or tale of marvels on no basis 
of truth is not Homeric,' and that in both 
' Iliad ' and ' Odyssey ' we have a transference 
of actual events to the domain of poetry. 

A recent study of the ' Odyssey ' by a French 
scholar, M. Victor Berard, is said by the re- 
viewers to contain some curious and convincing 
illustrations of Homer's accuracy as a geog- 
rapher and of his practical acquaintance with 
the navigation of the Mediterranean, with its 
islands and shores, its winds and currents, and 
with all the habits and customs of the seafaring 
folk that bordered its eastern waters. Even the 
farthest reaches of the hero's wanderings cease 
not to be linked with reality. Mr. Butcher 
quotes from the Frenchman's work some strik- 
ing instances of the close agreement in the 
' Odyssey ' between poetic fancy and prosaic 
reality of detail. In Book ii. 11. 212 ff., Tele- 
machus asks the suitors for a ship and twenty 
men, that he may go to Sparta and sandy Pylus 
to inquire about his father. The request is re- 
fused ; but Athene, in Mentor's guise, equips the 
expedition, and Telemachus sets sail with Men- 
tor, the hour being approximately indicated by 
line 388, ' The sun set, and shadowy grew all the 
ways,' a formula occurring seven times in the 



1906.] 



THE DIAL,

poem in connection with travel, and evidently 
demoting a late hour at night. Athene sent 'a 
favoring gale, a fresh wind from the northwest, 
singing over the wine-dark sea/ and early next 
morning Pyliis is reached. If we consult the 
oflScial ' Sailing Directions ' of to-day, says Mr. 
Butcher, we shall find that land and sea breezes 
alternate in those Greek waters, the wind from 
the sea beginning to blow each morning about 
ten o'clock and keeping all vessels in harbor the 
rest of the day, but subsiding at sunset, and 
followed, after some hours of calm, by the land 
breeze. Hence Telemaehus, leaving Ithaca 
about eleven at night, would have a favoring 
wind to waft him toward Pylus. The poet who 
described this voyage of Telemaehus had a ma- 
riners knowledge of that whereof he spake. 

Another example from the same source. Book 
V. 295-6 pictures a tempest encountered by 
Odysseus after he had left Calypso's island and 
was approaching the Phaeacian coast : * Eurus 
and Notus clashed together, and stormy Zephy- 
rus, and Boreas, bom in the bright air, rolling 
onward a great wave.' Of these four winds — 
southeast, southwest, northwest, and northeast, 
respectively — the last-named, Boreas, finally 
prevailed, blowing continuously for two days 
and two nights, then falling and giving place to 
a ' windless calm ' on the third morning. Again 
consulting the ' Sailing Directions,' we read, as 
quoted by Mr. Butcher : ' It f requentlv happens 
that winds from the N.E., X.W., and S.E. blow 
at the same time in different parts of the Adri- 
atic. The wind called Bora is most to be feared 
and demands active and incessant watch. . . 
. . In summer it never lasts more than three 
days.* Thus, we are assured by M. Berard, 
the storm that overtook Odysseus was no mere 
storm of literature, but a genuine Adriatic tem- 
pest. While Virgil's storms always rage three 
days, that is simply a part of his stock of poetic 
furniture. The author of the * Odyssey ' is 
minutely accurate in every detail; and the dis- 
turbance of the elements as described by him 
off the Phaeacian coast furnishes an interesting 
bit of confirmation of the old tradition that 
Phasacia and the modern Corfu are one and the 
same. 

That Greek literature should be distinguished 
by clearness, precision, minute attention to de- 
tail, is of course no more than one would expect 
from what is known of tlie Greek character and 
of the environment that helped to produce it. 
Under those bright blue skies, vagueness and 
mysticism were not at home. An insatiate love 
of knowledge, of facts as they actually are, 
marked the Greeks. This love of knowledge, 
says Plato in the Fourth Book of the * Eepublic,' 
they had in as marked a degree as the Phoeni- 
cians and Egv'ptians had the love of money. To 



know was to the Greek mind an excellent thing, 
apart from all use, sordid or noble, of the knowl- 
edge acquired. One important department of 
learning, however, was strangely neglected. 
Eager as the people of Greece were to leam 
about distant lands and their inhabitants, they 
appear to have held it not worth while, or not in 
keeping with their national importance, to leam 
foreign languages. Herodotus in his travels 
evidently blundered along as best he could with 
only his mother-tongue in which to make known 
his wants and his queries. Like the unthinking 
and untaught person of our own time and 
countr}', the cultivated Greek seemed almost to 
assume without question that the words of his 
own language were the original and natural 
names of things. Epicurus, observes our 
authority already so freely quoted, felt no doubt, 
skeptical philosopher though he was, that the 
gods, if they spoke at all, spoke Greek ; and even 
so acute a mind as Plato's fell a victim to fal- 
lacies that he would have easily avoided had he 
known the grammar of even one foreign tongue. 
But in one respect, and that a matter of lan- 
guage again, the love of detail and the striving 
for precision went so far as occasionally to try 
the patience of a modem reader of ancient 
Greek. The wealth and variety of modifying 
particles, designed to render impossible all de- 
fect in consecutiveness, to smooth over all ab- 
ruptness of transition, contribute at times to 
perplexity, or at least to irritation and weari- 
ness, rather than to perfect clearness. Pray, 
exclaims the much-enduring reader, cannot a 
reasonable being draw an inference now and 
then without the ofl&cious assistance of an illa- 
tive conjunction, or of two or three of them 
marvellously welded together, with crasis and 
elision and various euphonic changes of con- 
sonants and vowels? Yet over-scrupulous par- 
ticularity is better than slovenly ambiguity, and 
an infiinite capacity for taking pains than 
careless disregard of small things. 

The temptation is strong, even at the risk of 
perpetrating a few platitudes, to indulge in 
some closing reflections. A most excellent thing 
must one consider this Greek fondness for facts 
in all their details. There are times when the 
mind craves concrete realities large and small, 
as the raw material out of which mental tissue 
is formed, just as there are also moments when 
the longing is irresistible for the vague and 
mystical and dreamily suggestive. Preraphael- 
ism no less than impressionism, Greek clarity 
no less than Hindu mysticism, has its appointed 
hour. It is well at times to feel strongly con- 
vinced that knowledge is good for its own sake. 
Between knowing and not knowing, who could 
hesitate in his choice? A plus is always in- 
finitely preferable to a zero or a mi nun. More-

tion in daily conduct, what then is it? En-

SHAKES FSAEIAN DRAMA 
CHICAGO. 



IN 



It is almost ten years since the writer of this 
article published in The Dial a record of i\\c 
Shakespearian performances at the Chicago 
theatres during a season wliich had appeared 
noteworthy for its classical productions.* In 
view of the charges of decadence so often urged 
against the contemporary stage, and the public 
taste for dramatic amusement, together with 
the alternating assertions — on the one hand 
that Shakespeare is no longer enjoyed and 
therefore seldom iierformed, on the other that 
such and such a season has been signalized by 
a revival of the classic drama beyond precedent, 
— ^in view of much discussion of these and 
kindred themes, it may be that a complete 
record of the Shakespearian plays produced in 
Chicago during the past ten years will have not 
only a passing interest, but prove of value i? 
presenting facts bearing on the case. 

By way of furthei- comment, it may be said 
that while the Chicago stage is distinctly pro- 
vincial as compared with that in New York, it 
is undoubtedly less affected by artificial condi- 
tions than is that of the metropolis. Chicago is 
near the centre of national life, and is perhaps 
as truly indicative of the rise and fall of dra- 
matic values as any city in the country. 

AVliile it is not po^ible in this article to deal 
in detail with the clMracteristics of the ten 
seasons under review, attention is called to the 
first and last of the series, which appear to be 
the most notable of all. During the dramatic 
season of 1895-96, thirteen Shakespearian plavv-^

were presented : ' As You Like It, ' '^ Twelfth 
Night, ' ' Two Gentlemen of Verona, ' * Mid- 
summer Night's Dream, ' '' Merchant of Venice, ' 
*' Taming of the Shrew,' ' King Henry IV./ 
' Richard III., ' * Julius Caesar, ' "' Romeo and 
Juliet,' 'Macbeth,' 'Othello,' 'Hamlet.' 
'^rhere were two Richards, two Macbeths, two 
Violas, and two Rosalinds; three companies 
appeared in ' Taming of the Shrew, ' two in 
' Romeo and Juliet. ' There were four Othellos, 
five Shylocks, and seven Hamlets. In Septem- 
l)er and Octo]>er, Shakespeare was played for 
three weeks, Miss Rehan and Miss Marlowe 
appearing simultaneously during two weeks of 
the three. Again, in January and February, 
there were engagements covering three weeks: 
Mr. Whiteside, Mr, Skinner and Mr. Creston 
Clarke appearing in Shakespearian roles. 
During this period, ' Hamlet ' was presented 
fourteen times, and twice the theatre-goer had 
liis choice of two interpretations. In March 
there were thirteen performances, and in April 
sixteen. In every month of the season except 
November, Sliakespcare was played in Chicago. 
The companies of eleven different artiste 
appeared in these productions, and there were 
eighty-eight performances of these thirteen 
Tvlays. Besides the players already named, Mr. 
Warde, Mr. James, Mr. Mantell," and Thomas 
Keene appeared; the younger Salvini essayed 
the characters of Othello and Hamlet; Sir 
Henry Ir\nng was seen as Shylock and as Mac- 
beth. ■' 

From the table given at the end of this 
article, it is evident that, taking into account 
both the number of performances and the num- 
l>cr of plays presented, no subsequent season 
compare? in interest with the one reviewed, 
until we reach that of 1904:-5. This last season 
is so remarkable for its offerings in the Shakes- 
pearian drama that it is worth while to note 
the productions in detail. For tlie sake of clear- 
ness the various engagements are tabulated 
thus :

THE DIAL,

It will be seen that the record opens with the 
advent of ^Ir. Sdthem and Miss Marlowe in an 
engagement of three weeks, during which they 
presented the three plays, ' Eomeo and Juliet, ' 
' Much Ado, ' and * Hamlet, ' giving seven per- 
formances of each play. It was not until the 
last of January that an opportunity was again 
given to see a Shakespearian drama on the Chi- 
cago stage ; but the week of January- 23 brought 
two stars into the field of vision, Mr. Mansfield 
appearing for two weeks alternating in the 
roles of ' Eichard ' and ' Shylock, ' and Miss 
Rehan appearing for a single week in ' Taming 
of the Shrew. ' Twelve performances of 
' Romeo and Juliet ' by the Bush Temple Stock 
Company are recorded in February, and wc 
had during that same month the production of 
the ^Winter's Tale' by Mr. Warde and Miss 
Kidder. Yerv' ajjpropriately, April, the birth- 
month of the great dramatist, appears as the 
stellar month of the season. On April 3, Mr. 
Ben Greet began his notable engagement, of 
which the first two weeks were devoted to six- 
teen presentations of seven Shakespearian 
plays ; these were ' Twelfth Xight, ' ' Merchant 
of Venice, ' ' Two Gentlemen of Verona, ' 
' Comedy of Errors, ' ' As You Like It, ' ' Much 
Ado,' and ' Hamlet. " On the seventeenth of the 
month came Miss Viola Allen's appearance for 
sixteen performances in the ' Winters Tale. " 
Meanwhile Mr. Mantell, during the last week 
in April, was presenting his interpretation of 
• Richard III. ' Inasmuch as Mr. Mantell's pro- 
ductions were given nine times in the week, we 
have for the month of April. 1905. the note- 
worthy record of forty-one performances of nine 
Shakespearian pla^s; except on April 1 and 
on the first three Sundays of the month, there 
were presentations every day. Mr. Maritell's 
engagement included a week's appearances in 
' Othello ' and another week's in ' Hamlet.' In 
May, also, the Bush Temple Company gave 
eleven performances of * As You Like It. ' It 
should be added that in March ^liss Blanche 
Bates twice included ' Katharine and Petruchio ' 
as one of the plays in a double bill. Xo account 
is here made of an open-air performance of ' As 
You Like It' by Mr. Greet's company in Sep- 
tember at tile Onwentsia Club. The' 133 per- 
formances of these twelve pla3's certainly make 
the dramatic season of 1904-5 a very effective 
climax to this record of a decade. If now we 
were to include the engagement of Mr. Greet and 
his company during the summer season — eight 
performances of seven plays at the University 
of Chicago (July 12-23) and nineteen per- 
formances of six plays at Ravinia Park (July 
24- Aug. 5) — -we should have a truly remark- 
able record of 160 performances of fourteen 
plays. — ' Midsummer Xight's Dream ' and 



* The Tempest ' being included in this supple- 
mentary list. 

The writer does not care to pronounce any 
dicta upon the summary already given or upon 
that which follows. In the table appended, six 
down-town theatres are represented; they 
average, perhaps, eight performances a week, 
and the length of the regular season is about 
forty weeks. Upon this basis, any reader who i» 
fond of figures may, if he wishes, produce some 
more or less edifying calculations. But here 
are the simple records of the Shakespearian 
productions in Chicago for the past ten years.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



A QUESTION OF 'EXEMPLARY MORALITY. 
(To the Editor of Thb DiAt.) 

In the issue of your journal for Sept. 16 1 have 
read with some satisfaetiou the sympathetic no- 
tice of 'The Land of the Strenuous Life,' by the 
Abbe Klein. In the main, the criticism is gra- 
cious. The note of critical condescension, as 
might be exjjected, is not wanting. 

Into the notice there has crept a biting allu- 
sion that must cut eveiy Catholic reader to the 
quick. In no caiping spirit do I challenge the 
following innuendo: 'The exemplar>- morality, 
too, that he [the Abbe Klein] delights to attrib- 
ute to the restraining influence of the confes- 
sional might not be borne witness to by police 
court records.' No words coidd conceal the virus 
here hidden. No such dart could be hurled hap- 
hazard. Let me ask the reviewer, Do the police- 
court clerks keep a register of such criminals as 
are regularly at confession ? Do they find on in- 
quir>- the fact that the confessional has failed

of restraining them? To what statistics did the 
reviewer have access in venturing the amazing 
opinion above quoted? Is it another fulfilment 
of 'I don't knoAv the man, but I'd damn him at a 
venture?' Thomas Vincent Shannon. 

St. Malachy's Rectory, Chicago, Oct. 5, 1905. 

[Father Shannon's courteous letter of remon- 
strance and inquiry is of unusual interest to the 
reviewer; for it is just such communications, 
coming so unexpectedly as they do, that are 
blessed to our use in enabling us in some small 
measure * to see oursel 's as ithers see us. ' The 
'virus' which our correspondent so clearly de- 
tects must be present, in however diluted a form, 
else he could not have discovei'ed it; and the 
only thing for the infected patient to do is thank- 
fully to appl}' the anti-toxine furnished by the 
timely letter. And now the reviewer begs leave 
to ask in return whether, on re-reading the of- 
fending passage, the remonstrant would still con- 
sider his questions, concerning police-court regis- 
ters, quite as fair as they are diflScult to answer. 
For the sake of cleaniess, let us add a comma and 
change the form of the relative pronoun in the 
objectionable sentence, thus,— 'The exemplary 
morality, too, [of the Catholics,] which he de- 
lights to attribute to the restraining influence of 
the confessional, might not be borne witness to 
by the police-court records.' It was the alleged 
superiority of Catholic over Protestant morals, 
and not at all the efficacy of confession, that the 
reviewer ventured to call in question; and on 
this matter the police records might conceivably 
throw some light. Is it virulence in a critic to 
query whether those of a certain designated faith 
are morally superior to those of another? In 
conclusion, it may interest Father Shannon and 
other readers of The Dial to learn exactly what 
were the Abbe's words that aroused this discus- 
sion. He says, speaking of the Catholic Church: 
'By her sacraments, especially by confession, she 
combats intemperance, lust, and other vices, 
with a strength that the most beautiful discourses 
of Protestant ministei's can never equal.'— The 
Reviewer.] 

UNWORTETT READING FOR THE YOUNG. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
May the little flurry over the question of proper 
and impi'oper reading for the young be made the 
occasion for a word concerning one subtle but 
powerful influence in the undermining of public 
morality? I refer to the influence of a class of 
'literature' not to be described as inflammatory, 
perhaps, but certainly as sensational; not de- 
basing, but misleading; powerful, because it de- 
votes genuine talent in narrative composition to 
the exposition of false ideals with an air of 
plausibility well calculated to deceive the reader 
of fair but untrained intelligence; and danger- 
ous because it appeals primarily to readers too 



young and inexperienced to perceive and avoid 
the dangers of its quasi-teaching. 

The 'literature' that I have especially in mind 
is in periodical form; not the cheapest 'yellow' 
kind, but that which appears in the garb of ap- 
parent i-espectabilitj'. To be more particular, I 
have in mind as I wi-ite a magazine, several con- 
secutive numbers of which have recently by 
chance fallen into my hands,— numbers contain- 
ing a 'college' serial story. Now, there is no 
more attractive setting for a story for boys than 
that afforded by school or college life; and 
there is none harder to handle with justice to 
subject, author, and reader. Report the life real- 
istically, and the story becomes a diy account of 
daily study and recitation, with an occasional 
plum of adventure. Make it all football and fun, 
and the picture is false ; every incident may have 
actually occurred to some person, but never could 
all of them fall within the range of one person's 
experience. This story— told graphically and in 
very decent English— makes a course in college 
look like a four years' cruise with a crew of 
pirate cut-throats. 

A group of college students are unconsciously 
involved in a miserable web of intrigue, includ- 
ing two mui-ders, one of them the mysterious 
stabbing! of a student on the campus. The presi- 
dent of the college acts as little like a college 
president as the police chief and the coroner do. 
The students mob the police, and at the coroner's 
inquest two of them exchange knockdowns. The 
thing is untrue to college life— untrue, happily, 
to any life. Yet it is done cleverly enough,— with 
a cheap tinselled cleverness that makes it all the 
more dangerous. This magazine, and others like 
it, have a large circulation. Selling for a fairly 
high price, they of course go into homes where 
the thousands of boys who read them are of suffi- 
cient natural intelligence to make the most— or 
the worst— of their sensational suggestions.

The latest issue to reach us of the 'The Pub- 
lishers' Circular,' which covers very eflaciently 
the affairs of the English book trade, is an 'Au- 
tumn Announcement Number,' containing full par- 
ticulars of the forthcoming output of the English 
publishers. An absence of any scheme of classi- 
fication makes the information unavailable for 
quick reference; but a casual glance through the 
list has revealed several items of considerable 
literary interest which do not appear in the an- 
nouncements of any of the American publishers. 
Among these may be mentioned a new collected edi- 
tion, in eight finely-printed volumes, of the com- 
plete works of William Ernest Henley; a two-vol- 
ume 'Life of Charles Dickens, as revealed in his 
Writings,' by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald; a volume on 
' Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature, ' by 
Prince Kropotkin; the sixth and concluding vol- 
ume, entitled ' Young Germany, ' of George Brandes 's 
'Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature'; 
a collection of 'Essays on Mediaeval Literature,' 
by Professor W. P. Ker; ' The Puzzle of Dickens's 
Last Plot,' by Mr. Andrew I^ng; and a new edi- 
tion of W. Cory's 'lonica,' with a biographical in- 
troduction by Mr. Arthur C. Benson.

The Most Readable of the Anciexts.* 



A distinguished German philologist recently 
said that to find the l)est books of the past two 
decades one must consult not the Leipzig book- 
sellers' catalogues but the reports of the excava- 
tions of the Eg}ptian Exploration societies. In 
a similar vein a pleased reviewer may hazard 
the paradox that the best English book of the 
year may well prove to be Mr. and Mrs. Fow- 
ler's most readable translation of the mo6t 
readable of the ancients, Lucian. 

The little Syrian barbarian, knocking about 
Asia minor in Median doublet, made of him- 
self by the assimilation of good literature not 
merely a Greekling but a Greek; and verified 
again, five hundred years after it was uttered, 
Isocrates' boast that Atticism is not a racial in- 
heritance, but a spiritual initiation. 

The average college graduate knows Lucian 
chiefly, if not solely, as the author of those lively 
and much imitated skits, the ' Dialogues of the 
Dead ' and the *' Dialogues of the Gods.' But 
even the general reader may learn how much 
more he was, from no more recondite sources 
than Fronde's "' Short Studies,' Pater's ' Marius 
the Epicurean,' Mr. Lang's " Letters to Dead 
Authors,' Kenan's * Marcus Aurelius,' and, last 
but not least. Professor Gildersleeve's witty 
character-sketch and the brilliant introduction 
to Miss Emily James Smith's ' Selections.' 

Beginning as a perhaps briefless barrister and 
itinerant extension lecturer in the flamboyant 
conceited manner of the so-called new Sophistic 
or revived Atticism of the second century, his 
maturing taste gradually outgrew his tolerance 
of the pettiness of chicane and the trivialities 
of the schools. It amuses him to represent this 
process of growth as a conversion — a putting 
away of his old mistress Rhetoric, who had 
raised him to affluence, and a taking up with a 
new saucy companion, Dialogus the son of Phi- 
losophy ; and commentators have taken his allu- 
sions to it as seriously as the coming New Zea- 
lander will take Matthew Arnold's account of 
the affecting circimistances attending his own 
conversion from Philistinism. 

Taking his motifs now from the wildest 
flights of Aristophanic imagination, now from 
the character studies and niceh* discriminated 
types of the new comedy, now from the racy 
prose and poetry jumble of the cynical Menip- 
pean satire, Lucian's lively genius compounded 
from these elements, and the prose of Plato, 
Herodotus, and Demosthenes, perhaps the only

York : Oxford University Press. 



literary style thus artificially acquired that 
seems the native and natural expression of the 
writer's thought, and not a mere pastiche. The 
classicism of his manner heightens by piquant 
contrast the effect of the realism of his matter. 
For, once master of his instrument of expres- 
sion, he employed it chiefly on the one theme 
in which originality was still possible for a 
Greek writer — the portrayal and satire of the 
motley medley presented by the Greco-Koman 
empire at the culmination of its picturesqueness 
in the century that preceded its decline and faU. 
The opportunity for which Flaubert yearned 
and which Pater tried to recapture was his, and 
admirable was the use he made of it. 

It is from Lucian that we really get to know 
the world of Plutarch and Dio and Marcus 
Aurelius, of Herodes Atticus, Aulus Gellius, and 
Fronto, of Justin, Minucius Felix, Athenagoras 
and Celcus, of Apollonius of Tyana and Alex- 
ander of Abonoteichos. The fume, the din, the 
opulence of the world's capital, the splendors 
and miseries of the life of the Greek literary 
hanger-on in a great Roman house, the academ- 
ic peace and still air of delightful studies of 
Athens, the literary coteries, authors readings, 
and second-century clubs of every provincial 
centre of culture from Ephesus to Pella and 
Marseilles, the establishment of a new Zion and 
institute of divine healing in Paphlagonia, the 
misguided Christians who do not fear death be- 
cause they believe their souls immortal and are 
so easily duped because they esteem all men 
brothers, the philosophic side-shows and con- 
gresses of religion that fill the midway from 
Elis to the Olympic Games; gorgeous dinners 
of the smart set at Rome, wedding suppers and 
banquets of philosophers terminating in the ex- 
tinction of the lights and the intervention of 
the watch ; a slanging match between an agnos- 
tic and a Stoic philosopher in the Painted 
Porch; Thessalian witches practising weird in- 
cantations on the unwary traveller in remote 
wayside inns ; fanatic fakirs purging this mortal 
dross by burning themselves alive in the pres- 
ence of gaping admirers ; great Roman dames 
setting out for their summer villas with ladies' 
maids, curled dancing-masters, pet puppies and 
bearded Greek philosophers in their train; the 
cynic in begging friars' garb howling his con- 
tempt for the vanity of the world; the stately 
Platonist Ion who sees further into the theory 
of ideas than any living man, and whose pres- 
ence in purple robe at a social function is as 
the Epiphany of a god, — such are some of the 
scenes and tjpes portrayed in vivid panorama, 
a few of the facets of the ever-shifting kaleido- 
scope. 

Lucian, however, is more than an incompar- 
able show-master. He knows the inner Intel-

lectual and moral life of his time, can make 
every type of Greek and Roman, of philosopher, 
charlatan, visionary, professor and student, not 
only appear and speak, but think in character. 
And so it comes that he has a meaning if not a 
mes,sage for us. Tlie century which he depicts 
so vividly bears a startling resemblance to the 
age of Comtism, Monnonism, Darwinism, 
Christian Science, and the religion of humanity, 
— the age of the Parliament of Religions and 
the Society for Psychical Researcb. The con- 
quest of the globe by modern science and indus- 
trialism was la<?king. But the superposition of 
the Pax Romana and tlie white highways of the 
Roman legions on the crazy-quilt of nations, 
from the Euphrates to the Tyne, was a virtual 
equivalent in its effect on the imagination of 
the man in the street. Ilien, as now, a thin 
veneer of cosmopolitan culture imperfectly pro- 
tected an educated class ' dizzy with indiges- 
tion' of unassimilated philosophic?, from the 
infatuations of a populace distracted by the 
pretensions of nascent and moribund religions 
and bewildered by the conflicting traditions of 
juxtaposed but unmingling peoples. LAician's 
types, of which he fully perceives the typical 
significance, are so astonishingly pertinent and 
Up to date that the interpreter lies under the 
suspicion of interpolating modem touches for 
effect. The rise of the religion of Alexander the 
false prophet — of Abonoteichos, the conversation 
on Phantasms of the Living in the sick cham- 
ber of old Eucrates in which dignified profes- 
sors of philosophy vie with one another in the 
encouragement of the recrudescence of wonder, 
the epistle to an illiterate book-fancier, the ac- 
count of the career of the fakir Peregrine, could 
easily be adapted with slight changes of local 
color to the latitude of Chicago, New York, 
Cambridge, or Oxford. 

As offsets to all liucian's wit and cleverness, 
it is customarv' to urge the monotony of his 
'everlasting no,' the levity of his scepticism, 
the shallowness of the unsympathetic psychology 
that makes no allowance for the possible sincer- 
ity of Sludge the medium. Much could l)e said 
in defense or attenuation, did space permit. It 
is perfectly idle for men who ' do things,' and 
not infrequently do them wrong, to attempt to 
suppress negative and satirical criticism, 
whether in Lucian, Matthew Arnold, or the 
New York * Evening Post.' Construction and 
affirmation may be two-thirds or three-fourths 
of life, and may be the pleasanter task. But a 
good fraction remains for the indispensable 
business of obstruction, destruction, and nega- 
tion. Without it, hot-headed bunglers and cold- 
blooded speculators on the folly and weakness 
of humanity would have the world all their 
own way. A man i?; not disposed of by the cavil 



that his work was essentially negative and de- 
structive. The question is, was the work well 
done? Lucian 's genius and the conditions of 
his time called him to the task of negative 
satire. Sophocles was more fortunate, and was 
bom to a happier spiritual inheritance. But 
Lucian acted magnificently his part, and there 
all the honor lies. 

As for his levity, if we 'clear our minds of 
cant' (whether with small c or large K) we 
shall have to acknowledge that Lucian's attitude 
more nearly resembles the habitual temper of 
the intellectual leaders of our own time than 
does the cosmic emotion and the pathological 
introspection of Marcus Aurelius, which in their 
exalted moods they celebrate as the absolute re- 
ligion. The fact that the Hermotimus is emi- 
nently readable does not prevent it from being 
one of the most conclusive statements ever made 
of man's incapacity for al)solute metaphysics. 
Lucian's levity towards the Stoicism and Pla- 
tonism of his time is precisely on a par with the 
' shallowness ' of modern critics who refuse to 
take seriously the neo-Hegelian and neo-Kan- 
tian survivals and revivals of to-day. His super- 
ficiality is that of Anatole France, of LeMaitrc, 
of Scherer, and of Ronan, who justly pronounces 
him not only the most charming but the most 
solid intelligence of his age. ' . 

Lucian is now definitively added to English 
literature, and the l^higlish reader may seek the 
decision of these controversies for himself, — or, 
what is perhaps better, merely read him ' for 
human pleasure.' 'fhc translation is admirably 
executed in the freer manner of Jowett's Platte 
as opposed to the slightly archaic vocabulary 
and decalcomaniac fidelity of Munro's Lucre- 
tius, Myers's Pindar, and Lang, Tjeaf, and My- 
ers's Iliad. The Greek periods are broken up into 
short crisp sentences. The fair general mean- 
ing rather than the precise verbal turn of the 
original is reproduced. And the whole reads 
as an English original rather than as a transla- 
tion. Whatever the hazards of this method in 
the case of Plato, where great issues may hinge 
on the precise connotation of a word, and a 
caprice of Jowett's ])en create the legend of 
' Plato's golden rule,' it is certainly the best way 
to render the delightful but slightly tauto- 
logous fluency of Lucian. In the application 
of it, the present translators are apparently 
guided by a nicer sense of the true values of the 
Greek than Jowett possessed — or exercised. 
In spite of the liberties they allow thomselva«, 
it is rarely that a point is missed or a false note 
struck, idiom is rendered by idiom, proverb 
by proverb, and literary allusions, quotations, 
and technicalities of law, ]>hilosophy, or art are 
neatly turned by apt analogues. They sound 
even- note in Lucian's compass, from the mock-

1X)R1> Byrox Sel.f-Reveal.ei>.* 

Whatever one's individual judgment may be 
concerning Lord Byron, there is no blinking 
the fact that no poet was ever in his own life- 
time so swiftly, so tremendously popular. And 
not only in his own countr}', but throughout 
the world : for the first time an English poet 
attracted a contemporarv European audience, 
for the first time France and Germany and 
Italy recognized the literature of England. 
But also there is no blinking the other fact 
that when the centenary of this idol of his 
times came around (1888) his reputation had 
faded to such a degree that scarcely any note 
was taken of it, and his poetry seemed to have 
sunk into that ' half -life ' which, in sincerity 
or not, he had himself prophesied for it. 

The Day of Judgment set by Matthew 
Arnold has now come, yet who recognizes the 
fulfillment of the critic's prophesy : * When 
the year 1900 is turned, and our nation comes 
to recall her poetic glories in the centurj- which 
has then just ended, the first names with her 
will be these — Wordsworth and Byron.' From 
time to time, indeed, a Byron revival has 
seemed imminent, and even has been loudly 
proclaimed. It was looked for last year, with 
the completion of John Murray's definitive 
edition in tliirteen volumes, which had been 
several years in the making; while at the same 
time the late W. E. Henley was preparing a 
rival edition for Mr. Heinemann. There has 
just been published a complete edition of 
Byron's poems and dramas in the scholarly 
' Cambridge ' series edited by Mr. Bliss Perry ; 
and now we have a book called ' Confessions of 

• Tee Cokfkssioxs of Lord Btrox. Arranged by W. 
A. Lewis Bettany. London : John Murray. Imported by 
Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. 



Lord Byron,' containing no new matter, but 
consisting of classified excerpt* from his letters 
and journals, taken from the volimiinous Mur- 
ray edition. 

Although it cannot be said that any or all 
of these books have created the expected 
* Byron revival,' yet they do furnish the ma- 
terial for a better understanding of a ver}' 
contradictoi-y character as a man, and incident- 
ally some explanation of the vicissitudes of his 
reputation as a poet. The editor of these ' Con- 
fessions ' is Mr. W. A. Lewis Bettany. The 
fact that he has previously edited in similar 
fashion the 'Table-Talk' of Dr. Johnson 
plainly serves to account for the somewhat 
surprising subject of his introduction, ' On 
Byron's Obligation to Johnson' — an obliga- 
tion which, after all, is too casual to receive 
the prominence here given to it. The selections 
are classified imder six heads, and deal with 
Byron's reflections on himself, on contempor- 
ary English poet«, on his friends: also with 
his religious views, his opinions concerning the 
drama, and the literary life in general. Ar- 
ranged chronologically, and covering a period 
of over twenty years, they serve also to show 
the changes of mental attitude which the prog- 
ress of the years developed in Byron, as they 
do in all men of thought and experience. Alas 
that these revelations of his most intimate 
opinions estrange rather than endear us to 
the man ! Gladly would we feel toward Byron 
as we do toward Shelley, Scott, and Leigh 
Hunt, and love the man even as we admire the 
poet. On the contrary, we are impressed by 
his essential unlovableness. Before he had 
reached the age of twenty, he wrote : 

'Nature stampt me in the Die of Indifference. 
I consider myself as destined never to be happy, 
although in some instances fortunate. I am an iso- 
lated Being on the Earth, without a Tic to attach 
me to life, except a few School-feUows, and a 
score of females. Let me but *'hear my fame on 
the winds," and the song of the Bards in my Nor- 
man house, I ask no more, and don't expect so 
much. Of Religion I know nothing, at least in its 
favour. We have fools in all sects and Imposters 
in most. . . I am surrounded here by parsons and 
methodists, but, as you will see, not infected with 
the mania. I have lived a Deist; what I shall die 
I know not; however, come what may, ridens 
moriar.* 

That Byron had a most injudicious mother, 
is beyond question; that her ungovernable tem- 
per, cruel taunts, and unsympathetic attitude 
toward the physical deformity of her brilliant 
olffspring, embittered his whole life is also 
doubtless true. Yet withal she had a fierce 
and spasmodic affection for him which. ought 
to have shielded her from his habitual refer- 
ence to her as ' Clytemnestra,' or from such a 
letter as this, written after months of separa- 
tion and from a far-distant land :

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



'I trust you like Newstead and agree with your 
neighbors; but you know you are a vixen — is not 
that a dutiful appellation? Pray, take care of my 
books and several boxes of papers in the hands of 
Joseph; and pray leave me a few bottles of cham- 
pagne to drink, for I am very thirsty; — but I do 
not insist on the last article without you like it. 
I suppose you have your house full of silly women, 
prating scandalous things.' 

The only relative that Byrou ever really 
loved was his half-sister Augusta. In his 
letters to her, or in the journal which he kept 
for her during his foreign travels, he is to be 
seen at his gentlest and best, although seldom 
even there free from his gloomy and continual 
self-consciousness. After a tour of thirteen 
days among the Swiss Alps, he writes: 

'I am a lover of Nature and an admirer of 
Beauty. I can bear fatigue and welcome priva- 
tion, and have seen some of the noblest views in 
the world. But in all this — the recollections of 
bitterness, and more especially of recent and more 
home desolation which must accompany me through 
life, have preyed upon me here; and neither the 
music of the Shepherd, the crashing of the Ava- 
lanche, nor the torrent, the mountain, the Glacier, 
the Forest, nor the Cloud have for one moment 
lightened the weight upon my heart, nor enabled 
me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty, 
and the power and the Glory, around above and be- 
neath me, I am past reproaches; and there is a 

time for all things To you, dearest 

Augusta I send and for you I have kept this record 
of what I have seen and felt. Love me, as you 
are beloved by me.' 

Another fact which must always weigh 
against Byron is his falseness. He was abso- 
lutely without loyalty, either in love or friend- 
ship. Professing great attachment to Shelley, 
he yet listened to damaging stories which he 
knew to be untrue and then failed to fulfill 
his promise to exhibit the evidence which would 
have fully exculpated the accused. Byron, and 
Byron only, had it in his power to reverse one 
of the most cruel of all charges against Shel- 
ley; yet the letter which would have accomp- 
lished this, which he had promised to deliver 
and was under every obligation of honor 
to deliver, was found still among his papers 
after his death. He was false also to Leigh 
Hunt in the matter of ' The Liberal,' although 
later he made some show of generosity. The 
^ Confessions ' show other, though less flag- 
rant instances; in one letter there is an 
acknowledgement of liis own limitations in 
loyalty. 

'As to friendship, it is a propensity in which my 
genius is very limited. I do not know the male 
human being, except Lord Clare, the friend of my 
infancy, for whom I feel anything that deserves the 
name. All of my others are men-of-the-world friend- 
ships. I did not feel it even for Shelley, however 
much I admired and esteemed him; so that you see 
not even vanity could bribe me into it, for, of all 
men, Shelley thought highest of my talents, — and 
perhaps of my disposition.' 

Byron's delight in posing, in giving a theat- 



rical air to everything he said or did, cap- 
tivated his contemporaries. It threw a certain 
glamour over his personality, which shows up 
a bit dingy under our modern electric light. 
He loves to tell that his ' Lara ' was written 
' while undressing after coming home from 
balls and masquerades in the year of revelry 
1814'; he protested that he liked Iwing ro- 
mances better than writing them, and that he 
preferred the society of gentlemen to that of 
literary men; he indulged in alternate absti- 
nence and voracity in the use of food and 
drink; he professed an indifference verging on 
hostility to some things which, commonly de- 
light mankind, such as music and pictures. Of 
his love affairs he is never tired of making 
scenes and sensations. Writing in maturity of 
his first love affair (at the age of eight) he 
says : 

'My misery, my love for that girl, were so vio- 
lent that I sometimes doubt if I have ever been 
really attached since. Be that as it may, hearing 
of her marriage several years after was like a 
thunder-stroke — it nearly choked me — to the 
horror of my mother and the astonishment and al- 
most incredulity of everybody.' 

His first dash into poetry was with his sec- 
ond love-affair — at the age of twelve. 

On the principal question, why Byron's 
poetry fails to please to-day as it pleased our 
grandfathers and grandmothers, we da not 
get much light, nor could it be expected, from 
this book of ' Confessions.' The answer is to 
be sought rather in a consideration of a some- 
what new demand now made upon poetry, as a 
revelation of truth and a spiritual and moral 
insight. But on the secondary question, why 
even when admired as poet he is still not be- 
loved as man, there is much illumination. The 
answer is, — because he was personally self- 
absorbed and untender, because he was false as 
a friend, and because the theatrical air which 
was so taking in his time now fails to charm 
a more practical and more cynical age.

seem incomplete. Professor Greene's ' Provin- 
cial America/ for example, tells us of the first 
two wars between France and England; while 
King George's War and the French and Indian 
War form the theme of ' France in America/ 
by Dr. R. G. Thwaites. The division has been 
skilfully accomplished; and repetition, which 
might have marred the endeavor, has been re- 
duced to the lowest terms. 

As we have suggested, that which most of 
all connects the two books is the theme of 
militar)' and political history. We have long 
since ceased to look upon these wars between 
the French and the English as separate un- 
related events, or as merely a part of American 
history. Instead, we recognize in them but 
phases of a world-struggle between the two 
great civilizations of Western Europe, between 
Boman Catholic France and Protestant Eng- 
land. Sir John Seeley has shown us that the 
preparation for them begins not with Louis 
XIV. and William III., but with Queen Eliza- 
beth and Oliver Cromwell — monarchs who 
made the self-reliant, unattached, Protestant, 
maritime, commercial England. Henceforth, 
then, we demand that whoever shall write of 
these events shall do so in a large spirit, with 
something of the dash and vigor of the events 
themselves. This may be said of Professor 
Greene's account; but more especially is it 
true of Professor Thwaites's, as he recounts to 
us the thrillincr story of the Siege of Louis- 
burg, of Washington's expedition to the Ohio 
countrj', of Braddoclr's failure, and, finally, 
of the duel between Montcalm and Wolfe. 

When we turn from the tie of military liis- 
tory which binds these books together, to the 
characteristics which give to each its individu- 
ality, our task becomes harder. By far the 
larger part of ' Provincial America ' deals not 
with war, but with the constitutional and 
social history of the Colonies in the first half 
of the eighteenth century. Thus we have a 
continuation of Professor Andrews's * Colonial 
Self-government.' But there is this difference 
between the problems which faced Professor 
Andrews and these which Professor Greene has 
met: the earlier period is one which has been 
worked over and over. Doyle, for example, 
carried his work through the seventeenth cen- 
tur}-; and so, in a different way, did John 
Fiske. The Revolutionary period, likewise, has 
been well handled; but the interval which 
>eparates this from the seventeenth century has 
by many writers been slurred over. Mono- 
graphs have been written in great numbers — 
though even more are needed, we think — ^but 
there has been a distinct lack of some con- 
structive work to organize this scattered infor- 
mation. This labor Professor Greene has at- 
tempted; and, anticipating criticism by his re- 



mark that * It is hardly possible even now 
to write a history which can be called in any 
sense definitive; certainly no such claim is 
made for the present work/ he has given us 
a helpful and suggestive book. 

The opening chapter presents a very satis- 
factory resume of the conditions at the time of 
the Revolution of 1689; with due attention to 
the racial elements, religious differences, and 
economic occupations which made up American 
life. In contrast with the older policy, which 
was to leave to private hands responsibility for 
both CMJonomic and governmental administra- 
tion, and to permit a larger number of small 
governments with little or no parliamentary 
control, the new policy in the latter days of 
the Stuarts was to substitute royal provinces 
for parliamentary, and where possible for the 
elective or corporate system; to consolidate 
wherever occasion offered, and to deny repre- 
sentation to the inhabitants. The Great Revo- 
lution in England and the subsequent disturb- 
ances in America, together with the outbreak 
of war with France, led to a compromise by 
which representation was everywhere allowed, 
and consolidation was reduced to the union of 
several colonies under the same governor. The 
change from the other forms to the royal prov- 
ince was, however, put into effect by the new 
government, so that by 1691 no less than five 
of the twelve colonies had 'heen modelled after 
this type. 

The dissatisfaction of all concerned with 
the ensuing state of things led to further regu- 
lation by the government, and now, more 
especially by Parliament. The Navigation Act 
of 1696 and other legislation resulted. This 
l^islation was not limited merely to commerce, 
but included the Piracy Act of 1700, the Cur- 
rency Act of 1707, and the Post Office Act of 
1710. Moreover, besides this lawmaking, ihe 
organs of administration were improved by the 
establishment of the New Board of Trade, by 
increasing the supervision of colonial legisla- 
tion, by strengthening judicial control, by in- 
sisting on the right of appeal to the Privy 
Council in England, and finally by direct at- 
tack on the colonial charters. On the other 
hand, colonial dissatisfaction expressed itself 
in vigorous resistance, and resulted in the sub- 
stitution of a uniformity in the opposition of 
colonial assemblies to the governors which was 
entirely lacking in the earlier period. In- 
fluenced by the course of politics abroad, pay- 
ing close regard to such acts as the Habeas 
Corpus and the Toleration Act, always willing 
to learn a lesson from the now nearly autono- 
mous corporations to the East, all the English 
colonies, no matter what their form, tended 
toward constitutional government and democ- 
racy.

THE DIAI. 



[Oct. 16, 



Following this is an interesting and fair- 
minded chapter upon the ecclesiastical relations 
between Puritans and Anglicans, 1689-1714, 
Next come the chapters on the French wars, 
to which reference was made above. As these 
possess less distinction than the otlier parts of 
the work, we proceed at once to the latter half 
of the book, in which are discussed imperial 
policy and administration to 1743 and provin- 
cial politics throughout the same period, pro- 
vincial leaders, immigration and expansion, the 
founding of Georgia, and provincial industry, 
commerce, and culture. 

In this part of the work the results seem to 
us less satisfactory. Undoubtedly this is due 
in large measure to the necessity for compres- 
sion and to the confused nature of the events 
and circumstances which are chronicled. But 
we feel also that Professor Greene does not 
show that intimate acquaintance with the 
sources which is evident in his treatment of the 
earlier period. Did space permit, this criticism 
might be elaborated at length; but we are 
forced to mention only a ver}'^ few points. 
First, there is no satisfactory reference to the 
constitutional experiences of any other English 
colonies than those on the coast : whereas much 
may be learned, by comparison, from the his- 
tory of Jainaica, for example. The handling 
of internal affairs in New England seems some- 
what disjointed ; and the picture of New Eng- 
land life and thought is not as clear as one 
would like. No one could gather from Profes- 
sor Greene's account an accurate idea of the 
circumstances which preceded the Great Awak- 
ening (p. 321). 

Again, though this relates to the earlier 
chapters, the account of politics in Pennsyl- 
vania leaves practically untouched the inter- 
esting constitutional experiments of that col- 
ony, and does not mention the formation in 
1702, by the lower countries on the Delaware, 
of a separate assembly. In the southern colo- 
nies where the colonial archives remain largely 
unprinted, Professor Greene's treatment is still 
less satisfactory. In Maryland, notwithstand- 
ing Dr. Steiner's exhaustive monograph, we 
have' no adequate account of the restoration of 
the Proprietary Government. Nothing is said 
about the influence of German immigration 
into this colony, although it was very largely 
this which drew Maryland away from the 
southern colonies and made her a farming as 
well as a planting state. Reference is made to 
the improvement of tobacco in Maryland by the 
inspection law of 1747, but nothing is said of 
the similar conditions in Virginia or of the 
inspection laws beginning in 1730 which served 
as a model to the Marylanders. Finally, the 
interesting connection between this legislation 



and the mercantile system of Great Britain 
is left entirely unclear. 

These seem to us to constitute some weak- 
nesses in the latter part of ' Provincial Amer- 
ica.' On the other hand. Professor Greene has 
given us an excellent sketch of Georgia, has 
described satisfactorily Walpole's regime and 
the Molasses Act, has recognized the indi- 
viduality of some colonial leadere whose names 
usually have been allowed to pass unnoticed, 
and, above all, has blazed the way into a 
difficiilt field, making it rhuch easier for future 
writers to follow liim. Surely, we owe hi in 
thanks. 

While Professor Greene has dealt with a 
limited period of time and a widely scattered 
number of topics. Dr. Thwaites's work covers 
nearly three centuries and has a unity deter- 
mined by the events themselves. Facile prin- 
ceps among the American writers of this gen- 
eration who have made the French colonization 
of America their field of study. Dr. Thwaites 
in this volimie sums up the results of many 
years devoted to the special investigation of 
his subject. Again in contrast with the deartli 
of constructive work iipon English America, 
the twelve volumes of Parkman have told the 
story of New France, and the magni nom- 
inis umbra still abides. But many years 
have passed since Parkman wrote, and it is, 
indeed, well to have Professor Thwaites re- 
capitulate the results of recent criticism and 
fresher scholarship. 

As we have suggested at the beginning of 
this review, the struggles known as King 
George's War and the French and Indian War 
form the central theme of this volume. These 
ten chapters make up more than half the book, 
and constitute an account of this famous duel 
which will not soon be superseded. There is 
appended a short chapter upon Spanish rule in 
Louisiana, from 1762 to 1803. Thus barely 
one hundred pages are left for the whole period 
before 1740. The author begins at the very 
Ijeginning, and describes to us the processes 
which built up New France, the Acadian 
frontier, and Louisiana. This story of foun- 
dations is unfortunately compressed, and much 
detail — we might say almost all detail — is 
omitted. The narrative of Coligny's attempts 
at colonization in the South is dismissed in 
a few lines, aiid one has to turn back to Pro- 
fessor Bourne'3 'Spain in America' for the 
full account. The structure of the trading- 
companies is scantily treated. The name of 
Colbert does not appear in the Index, nor an 
account of his nursing of Canada, between 
1664 and 1683, in the text. Again, hardly 
enough is said of the settlement and develop-

ment of the French West Indies. On the other 
hand, a spirited narrative describes the exploits 
of La Salle and Tont}', of Iberville and Bien- 
ville. We are made to see how Fleuri and 
Walpole both wished peace but were driven to 
war by the Spanish interest, how Yemon failed 
at Cartagena, and how Anson won a brilliant 
name by his exploits in the Pacific. We 
then come again to the war period, and by the 
comparison are led once more to wish that 
Dr. Thwaites had been able to give as full 
treatment to the earlier part of his work. 

In closing, we wish to lay special emphasis 
upon two excellent characteristics of this work. 
The first is the wealth of geographical knowl- 
edge which is exhibited both in the text and in 
the excellent maps. The second is the spirit 
of wise, imprejudiced sympathy which pervades 
the work, and which is nowhere better dis- 
played than in the chapter on ' The People of 
Xew France.' Here, sharply criticising the mis- 
taken autocratic rule of France, through gov- 
ernor, intendant, and bishop, the lack of any 
self government, and the reign of graft which 
corrupted the whole oflBcial system. Dr. 
Thwaites stops to pay a merited tribute to the 
clergy, the Jesuits, Recollects, Sulpicians, and 
Capuchiens. 'It is not necessary to be a 
Catholic, nor is it essential that from the 
standpoint of the twentieth eentur}- we should 
endorse the wisdom of its every act in the 
eighteenth, most profoundly to admire the 
wM-k of the Church of Bome both among 
whites and savages in New France. American 
history would lose much of its welcome color 
were there blotted from its pages the pic- 
turesque and often thrilling story of the Cures 
and friars of Canada in the French regime.'

Ivory Carvixgs, Olu axd New.* 

Although the ivory carvings which have come 
down to our day from ancient times have en- 
gaged the attention of numerous critics and 
archaeologists for more than two centuries, the 
voluminous literature which has grown up 
about them Ls for the most part made up of 
monographs on special objects, or classes of 
objects, and critical papers concerning them. 
The fijst compendious account in any lan- 
guage of the progress of ivory carving 
throughout the world's history' is furnished 
by Mr. Alfred Maskell in his treatise on 
* fvories,' published in the ' Connoisseur's 
Library,' a series of art books now appearing 

• Ivories. By Alfred Maskell, F.S.A. Illustrated.

Sons. 



under the general editorship of Mr. Cyril 
Davenport of the British Museum, A high 
standard of excellenc-e is set in this book : it can- 
not fail to take rank at once as the authoritative 
work upon the subject of which it treats. 

The field covered by Mr, Maskell is a wide 
one, — too wide, in fact, to be treated with 
equal thoroughness throughout by any one per- 
son. Nevertheless, the shortcomings of his book 
are surprisingly few, and are trivial when 
weighed against the very obvious merits. Aside 
fnHn a few points that are open to difference of 
opinion, the chief thing that might perhaps be 
criticised is the scope of the work itself. Such 
criticism, however, is disarmed by the pain< 
which the author has taken to obviate, as far as 
he might, the tendency to incompleteness of 
view arising from the limitation of his theme. 
Considering the closeness of the relation of art- 
work in ivory to other branches of gljrptic art, 
— if, indeed, mere difference in material (as, 
for example, that between ivory and wood) can 
be said to constitute a separate branch, — a 
treatise devoted exclusively to ivories would of 
necessity seem to involve a partial and insuffi- 
cient presentation of the subject. Nor does the 
difficulty end here. True connwsseurship calls 
for comprehensive knowledge, including in its 
purview all things whatsoever which in any way 
throw light upon the objects under considCTa- 
tion. This appears to be well understood by 
Mr. Maskell, as his frequent references to cog- 
nate works in various fields attest. The man- 
agement of this side of his topic was not the 
least difficult part of his task. Manifestly, ho 
could touch but cursorily upon anything lying 
outside his immediate subject; else not one 
volume, but many volumes, wo^ild have been 
required. What was necessary was to indicate 
sufficiently that his survey is inclusive, and that 
the opinions expressed rest upon a far wider 
foundation than the study, however intimate, of 
ivories alone, or even chiefly, c-ould give. For 
ivory carving is only a phase; it is not a thing 
of itself apart. It does not even call for much 
teclinical knowledge not possessed by the car- 
vers of other materials. Yet, partly as the rer 
suit of chance, it occupies a place of importance 
in the history of art, of which, in a way, it 
furnishes a sort of epitome: alm(»t the only 
existing remains of European art work during 
some of the early centuries of the Christian era 
being ivory sculptures. 

It is but natural that the authors predilec- 
tion for ivories should lead him to hold a somcr 
what exaggerated notion of their intrinsic 
beauty. ' Ivors* would seem to be a medium." 
he says, ' in which the refined taste of the great 
sculptors of Greece must have delighted.' Dct 
spite the use of ivory in chryselephantine

statues by Phidias and Praxiteles, of which 
history speaks, this statement can be accepted in 
a limited sense only. That ivory is a beautiful 
substance, caiinot be gainsaid; yet artists and 
art-lovers capable of appreciating the finer 
qualities in works of art find it as a material too 
pretty. It lends itself to delicacy and refine- 
ment of a certain sort, but not readily to the 
dignity and strength that noble works must 
have. That the Greek sculptors should have 
failed to perceive this, is beyond the bounds of 
probability. By the Japanese, the essential 
weakness of works carved from ivoiy is well 
understood. Neither vigor of conception nor 
tour de force in execution can quite do away 
with the prettiness. Effects far more bold and 
nigged can be got from wood. The ease with 
which minute detail can be carved in ivory is 
also a pitfall. And so, in spite of their unde- 
niable beauty, the works of the post-renaissance 
ivory sculptors, with rare exceptions, fail to 
yield quite the same degree of aesthetic pleasure 
as do the comparatively crude and naive per- 
formances of their fellow-craftsmen of the dark 
ages. No doubt, much of the cachet of the 
earlier works is due to a finer and truer sense of 
composition; but apart from this, their direct- 
ness and simplicity give them a distinction 
rarely achieved by the more elaborate works of 
modern times. 

The book opens with an interesting and in- 
structive introductory chapter. This is fol- 
lowed by one on prehistoric ivories. Here the 
author, in his desire to be comprehensive, strays, 
it would seem, somewhat beyond bounds, and 
into a field that he has not thoroughly explored. 
The pieces of bone with drawings upon them, 
said to have been found in ancient cave-dwell- 
ings, may perhaps be classed as ivories, but not 
as ivory sculptures. As to the piece of a rein- 
deer's antler carved to represent the head and 
shoulders of an ibex, which is figured on plate 
I, it is so far beyond any well attested accomp- 
lishment of barbaric man that it is impossible 
not to wonder at the author's credulity in ac- 
cepting it as genuine; more especially as he 
refers, further on, to the fact that * there has 
been a not inconsiderable output of spurious 
things of the kind which profess to have been 
discovered .... in the caves of the Dor- 
dogne,' to which locality this piece is attributed. 
The author is on surer ground in the next chap- 
ter, which deals with ivories from the ruins of 
Nineveh and from ancient Egypt. Many of 
these have been so changed in their outward 
appearance as to be unrecognizable as ivory by 
the untrained observer. Some pieces, we are 
told, ^are hardly to be distinguished from 
ebony; others resemble basalt, slate, fossilized 
wood, sandstone, wax, or even possess almost 



the iridescence of opal.' Still others resemble 
turquoise so closely as to require a chemical test 
to determine their true character. 

Each of the nineteen chapters of this book 
might well claim the attention of the reviewer 
were space available for such extended com- 
ment. One of the most important is that de- 
voted to the so-called consular diptychs. When 
formed of two leaves, the wax-covered writing- 
tablets in common use in Europe until modern 
times were termed diptychs. The back of each 
leaf was ' slightly hollowed out, leaving a raised 
margin to hold a very thin layer of wax, the 
surface of which was colored, usually black or 
green, so that the letters scratched upon it with 
the metallic style might appear white and be 
easily legible.' For several centuries such tab- 
lets specially made to order from the finest ivory 
obtainable, and often elaborately carved and 
sometimes otherwise embellished, were fre- 
quently used by the Roman Consuls, upon their 
accession to that exalted rank, for presentation 
to other liigh dignitaries. The few leaves of 
these consular diptychs that have survived 
until our day are all in public collections, where 
they are highly treasured. In what he has to 
say about these and the closely-related earl>' 
Christian and Byzantine ivories, as also about 
reliquaries, crucifixes, pastoral staves, bishops 
chairs, and other ecclesiastical accessories, Mr. 
Maskell writes with the authority of a scholar 
conversant with all the ramifications of his sub- 
ject. He is equally at home in discussing the 
ivory-worker's art as practiced in Europe in 
modem times, and its application to chessmen, 
draughtsmen, furniture, musical instrum.enfc«. 
weapons, and various other things. A large num- 
ber of the more important pieces in European 
collections are described in some detail. 

When he turns to the Orient, the author'o 
information is not so wide, nor is so much of it 
at first-hand. The chaptier on China and Japan ^ 
though it contains no serious errors, is the weak 
est in the book. It is cliiefly taken up with net- 
sukes, concerning which he admits that in the 
opinion of many connoisseurs (and of all Japa- 
nese, though he does not say so) the wooden 
ones are best ; but ' there are considerations,' 
he thinks, which, 'other things being equal,' 
ought to make us prefer the ivory ones ! Of the 
okimono of recent years, though some of them 
are of rare merit, he has nothing to say, except 
that the finest ones are ' quite modem. ' His 
orthography of Japanese names is not im- 
peccable. The occurrence of ' Shintu ' and 
' Shintuism ' on the same page with Shinto, the 
correct form, is a blunder that is espedally 
noticeable because the book is unusually free 
from such mistakes. 

The ransre and varietv of the information

THE DIAL 



241 



scattered throughout the book is very great. 
One item which should perhaps be noted here 
is the extent of the importation of ivory into 
Europe. In 1900 it represented no less than 
30,000 slain elephants. For billiard-balls alone, 
the London dealers require tusks from 5,000 
elephants annually. The wonder is that the 
supply has not long ago given out entirely. Col- 
lectors and students will appreciate the chapter 
on forgeries, coloring and staining, artificial 
ivory, and other matters of interest. The book 
is made serviceable by an ample index, a bib- 
liography, lists of ivories, with a table giving 
their origin, date, dimensions, and present 
ownership, and also b\^ the very full and excel- 
lent illustrations for which the collotj-pe process 
has been used with most satisfying results. A 
minor defect is the omission in the text of ref- 
erences to the plates. This is unfortunate, since 
it makes it troublesome for the reader to collate 
the descriptions of objects with the representa- 
tions of them that are given. And it is made 
more aggravating by wrong attributions to the 
plates in the list of ivories intended to supplv 
ttie deficiency. For instance, wherever an object 
is said to be illustrated on plate VII., it will be 
found on plate Y., and vice versa. But, as has 
been said before, the faults of the book are ex- 
ceedingly slight. It is handsomely printed, 
light in the hand for so large a volume, and the 
appeal it makes to the eye is not belied on closer 
acquaintance. Fbedebick W. Gookix. 



The Yol'th of Xapoleox.* 



No part of Xapoleon's life is so difficult to 
portray as his youth and his military career 
up to his employment at the siege of Toulon. 
School-days or positions of subordinate com- 
mand do not offer scenes adequate to the stag- 
ing of extraordinary actions. There is some- 
thing petty and cramping even about the tur- 
moil of Corsica, so that the most serious risk 
run by the young hero is not the assassin's knife 
or the party guillotine, but coming off with a 
belittling reputation. Under the circumstances, 
the biographer, especially if his knowledge of 
the evidence is so complete that he must reject 
the usual legendary material, useful in heighten- 
ing effects, must tell the story plainly, with 
occasionally a generalization hardly borne out 
by the narrative but testifying to the convic- 
tion that his hero's youth was somehow in keep- 
ing with his later career. If there is anjrthing 
disappointing about such a good piece of work 
as Mr. Browning's, this is the reason. 

* Kapoleox : The Fibst Phase. Some Chapters on the 
Boyhood and Youth of Bonaparte, 1769-1793. By Oscar 
Browning, M.A. With portraits. New York : John Lane Co. 



In his Introduction the author explains that 
his work is based primarily upon the material 
which M. Masson has published in ' Napoleon 
Inconnu ' and M. Chuquet in ' La Jeunesse de 
Napoleon.' The labors of M. Chuquet espe- 
cially have added much to what has been known 
of the military schools of the old regime and of 
the organization of the army just before the 
Bevolution. M. Chuquet has also thrown a 
good deal of light into the confusions of Cor- 
sican polities, but Mr. Browning confesses that 
it is still difficult to form a satisfactory judg- 
ment about several incidents in which Napo- 
leon had a share, * because we do not know 
enough about Corsiean manners and customs.' 

The account of the military schools at Brienne 
and at Paris gives a remarkably clear view of 
Napoleon's opportunities for intellectual prepa- 
ration. Incidentally, it appears that the morak 
of the boys at Brienne were in a deplorable 
state, and this, in Mr. Browning's opinion, ex- 
plains the fact that for some time Napoleon 
held aloof from his fellow students. In the 
Ecole Militaire at Paris, the moral tone was 
better. In spite of his original aversion, for his 
fellow-students at Brienne, he seems to have 
lavished promotion upon several of them years 
later when power came into his hands. His 
teachers also were richly rewarded. Unhappily, 
one of these was Pich^ru, whose reward 
chanced to be a tragic death as a conspirator 
against his old pupil. 

Were one to read the conclusion of this bode 
first, the suspicion might be provoked that Mr. 
Browning is so warm an admirer of Napoleon 
that the evidence has received the most favor- 
able interpretation. The words are: 

*Sarelv, in his ease also, the youth is father of

most difficult circumstances which could try the 
qualities of a character, crowned by high success 
legitimately gained, are not likely to have been fol- 
lowed by twenty-three other years stained by uni- 
versal ambition, reckless duplicity, and an aimless 
lust of bloodshed. The contemplation of this la- 
borious and brilliant youth may, perhaps, dispose 
Englishmen to look more favourably upon those 
epochs of his career when devotion to the interests 
of France made him, for a time, the most formid- 
able enemy of our own country.' 

It is not a little strange that Mr. Browning 
has found no serious lack of honor, to say noth- 
ing of ordinary honesty, in Napoleon's explana- 
tions of prolonged absence without leave from 
his regiment while he was in Corsica fishing in 
troubled waters and accomplishing nothing of 
advantage except for his own faction. In the 
course of the struggle a law of the Legislative 
Assembly recalled to their regiments all volun- 
teer officers below the rank of lieutenant-colonel. 
To save himself from a forced return to France, 
Napoleon became a candidate for the position

of second lieutenant-colonel in a Gorsican bat- 
talioii of volunteers. One of the three commis- 
sioners who were to preside at the election was 
to lodge at the house of a rival. Napoleon 
sent a friend to bring- this commissioner by force 
to his own house. He said to him, * I desired 
that you should be free; you are not free with 
the Peraldi; here you are at home.' Possibly 
this was a reminiscence of the way the Parisians 
rendered Louis XVI. ' free ' by forcibly remov- 
ing him to Paris. Mr. Browning gravely dis- 
cusses the question whether Napoleon's act of 
violence accounted for his election as second 
lieutenant-colonel. Mr. J. H. Rose, another 
Englishman who has recently written on Napo- 
leon with the saane material before him, calls 
it his ' first coup/ A comparison with Mr. 
Rose's conclusions in several other cases shows 
liow favorable are Mr, Browning's interpreta- 
tions of evidence. Upon the disputed question 
of Napoleon's share in the plan of campaign 
against Toulon, Mr. Browning also adopte the 
view that it was Napoleon who first pointed out 
the strategic value of the peninsula of L'Eguil- 
lette. Except in one or two instances like this, 
the author furnishes enough of the evidence to 
guard the reader against a too ready acceptance 
of all the inferences. 

In Appendix I. are three of Napoleon's minor 
papers, of which the one on Corsica is the most 
interesting in its revelation of the tendencies 
and methods of his thought. His pamphlet, 
' Le Souper de Beaucaire,' is analyzed at length, 
with selected passages, in the body of the book. 
A second appendix gives several papers, from 
the British Museum, on the operations at Tou- 
lon. Altogether this is an important contribu- 
tion to the study of Napoleon's early career, 
clearing away the accretions of legend and pre- 
!<enting the known facts with satisfactory ful-

Baker Dunn's 'Cicero in Maine, and [eight] 
Other Essays' (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.) lose 
none of their brightness, their gentle satire, their 
quiet humor, by being thus reprinted. The curi- 
osity-provoking title of the initial chapter refers 
to the writer's study of Cicero's 'Catiline' in a 
class of wide-awake and original youths and 
maidens at a high school next door to Augusta, 
Maine,— at Hallowell, one infers from internal 
evidence. I^ter experience as a copious reader 
and happy day-dreamer in a college library ap- 
pears to point to Wiaterville College, now Colby 
University, as the scene of action, or inaction, as 
one chooses to call it. 'The Meditations of an 



ex-Sehool-Committee Woman' contain sensible 
suggestions on common-school education and edu- 
cators, including a protest against the modern 
method of dispensing with text-books and mak- 
' ing the teacher and the blackboard and the note- 
book take their place. A little more training of 
the child in the use of printed books, a little less 
educing of the subject-matter out of the vacant 
mind of the pupil, and thus a good deal less 
labor and discouragement on the teacher's part, 
are advocated. The present-day constipated 
course of study, embi*acing various matters un- 
dreamt-of by those Hallowell youths and maid- 
ens, is also deprecated. In 'The Browning Tonic' 
an inspiriting word is spoken for the bracing in- 
fluence of Browning's verse. Mrs. Dunn is dis- 
posed to 'welcome each rebuff that turns earth's 
smoothness rough,' and she avails herself of this 
text to have a little fling at peace congresses and 
at 'the attitude of the American people— too 
large a proportion of them at least — toward the 
Cuban war.' To her this unmartial attitude 
'illustrates the deterioration of fibre which is 
the result of an unstrenuous standard. ' From her 
point of view, and to one bearing in mind the 
perilously narrow dividing line between concilia- 
tion and cowardice, between forbearance and 
fear, she is hard to answer. But may there not 
be a lai'gei", a saner, a still more courageous phil- 
osophy of the vexed question, that shall in the 
interests of our common humanity, and of our 
spiritual rather than our physical evolution, dare 
to brave the taunt of cowai-dice— a harder thing 
than to face the enemy's cannon? Mrs. Dunn's 
style is delightful. 'All my world of nature,' she 
Avrites, 'is underlaid and permeated by my world 
of books; all ray world of books is sweet with 
vernal breezes and interfused with that something 
"whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, and 
the round ocean and the living air and the blue 

sky.'" 

Gropings in Under the dubious title, 'Science 
the realm of and a Future Ufe' (H. B. Turner 
t/ic unhnmrni. jj^ Co.), a one-time pi'ofessor of 
Ethics and Logic in an important university pre- 
sents a risumi of sittings with trance-mediums 
and similar data gathei-ed by himself and other 
members of the Society for Psychical Research, 
and points the moral of the tale thus adorned to 
the hypothesis of communication by disembodied 
spirits. Dr. Hyslop is earnest and able, and de- 
sires to be judicious and restrained. He has a 
logical conscience, and is commendably free from 
dogmatism and propagandism. He presents him- 
self as dinven by his experience and the 'facts' 
to some sort of a spiritistic hypothesis, even 
though the revelations from the beyond prove 
trivial and drivelling. Yet the good temper of 
his volume cannot shield it from the serious eon- 
sequences of its offense; and to those who cher- 
ish as something precious the reputation of 
science and the worth and ideals of the votaries 
thereof, equally with those who draw from re- 
ligious faith a sensitiveness and a healthy-mind- 
erdness that make for intellectual refinement and 
stability, the volume is nothing less than offiensive.

More especially is the name of psychology— so 
unfortunately yet inevitably associated with 
psychic research— taken in vain, and, by those 
who know not the true character of that science, 
made to appear contemptible. There is a logical 
as well as a religious faith ; and whatever of in- 
terest or enlightenment may cling to the conglom- 
erate of 'cases' here massed, after we shall be 
informed as to their modus operandi the assump- 
tion that they require supernormal hypotheses is 
intolerable. In that direction lies, not science, 
but learned superstition. Naturally, one express- 
ing this opinion is called dogmatic, and is invited 
to consider how often • residual' unexplained phe- 
nomena have led to important discoveries. This, 
as well as other analogies that are abused in the 
volume, may be disqualified by a simile, and this 
must suflBce as a commentary upon the logical 
obliquity that pervades those who 'research' in 
Dr. Hyslop's temper. His attitude is comparable 
to that of a student of human locomotion who re- 
gards the actual problems of how men really 
walk with material muscles on actual terra jirvnja, 
as commonplace, but who is keen for any evi- 
dence of flying (we all fly in dreams), or walking 
on air or water, or other supernormal accom- 
plishments; and who regards his position as mod- 
est because he does not propose an ambitious 
soaring in the clouds, but only an occasional 
s{X)radic case of walking just a few inches above 
the ground. A miracle is not measured by its 
degi*ee, and at the bar of science there are no 
mitigating circumstances. 

xnEngiuK *My Garden in the City of Grar- 

offUxr'a vnfe dens' (John Lane Co.) is not at all 
m India, ^ conventional garden-book. Ra^th- 

er is it a diary of incidents, reflections, and mem- 
ories, with occasional references to the garden 
which the author over-looks as she writes. The 
scene is Ijakhnao, India, and the anon3mous 
writer is an English captain's wife, whose diary 
covers a period from October to Jime, the most 
extreme limit of a stay in the plains for ordinary 
white folks. So minute are .some of the descrip- 
tions, that one gets a fairly vivid impression of 
the life in that far coimtry, where so many 
Englishmen are condemned to spend their lives, 
where their devoted wives accompany them, and 
where white children, because of the terrible cli- 
mate, are almost unknown. The many devices 
for mitigating the heat are described, together 
with its effects on man, beast, and vegetation. 
There are accounts of the social life of the white 
residents, and of the ways of the dirtj- natives, 
of whose habits one must not think too closely, 
when so much of life is dependent upon them, 
—for the intense heat is so enervating that it in- 
duces i-eliance upon the labor of others. In the 
Mem-Sahib's garden, the mistress does nothing 
herself; she merely stands by and directs her 
servants. What energy she has is devoted to the 
necessary visiting, — for there is much ceremony 
connected with the military service; to riding 
in the cool of the day, generally very early in 
the morning; and to superintending her house- 
hold. She describes two or three hunting expedi- 



tions, one for wild boar; a flower-show iu 
'Caesar's Garden'; a high-caste native festivity, 
'memorial service and garden-party combined,' 
the Mohurrum in the Hosein-a-bad ; and the wed- 
ding of a certain lovely Belinda, whose flirtations 
have caused her neighbor much trepidation. Nu- 
merous incidents of the Mutiny are related, in 
connection with excursions into the town and 
adjoining country. Quite lengthy directions are 
given for skinning and motmting birds and ani- 
mals, which the hunters generally do for them- 
selves. There are occasional lapses into reflec- 
tions that smack of the school-girl essay, and quo- 
tations and allusions abound on every page. One 
suspects that these latter are given from memory, 
without verification, especially when lines from 
Browning's 'Home Thoughts from Abroad* are 
attributed to Mrs. Browning. The writer also 
has the bad habit of adapting her quotations to 
her needs, while still retaining the marks of quo- 
tation. However, in spite of these faults and 
such others as an awkwaitl style of writing and 
the lack of a glossary of Indian words, the book 
contains a good deal that is of interest in regard 
to life and nature in India. 



FhUoaopHy: Mr. Edmond Holmes's inquiry as 
Its meaning to 'What is Philosophy?* (John 
and hiatoTi,. i^ng Co.) is not only a distinctly 
readable little essay, but it is illuminating as well. 
It would be hard to find a more persuasive state- 
ment of a certain way of looking at the task of 
philosophy— a way to which not all philosophers 
by any means would give approval, but which 
will at least, it is likely, open up a new outlook 
to many a perplexed reader to whom the word 
has represented something wholly vague and 
misty in its demarkations, if not a scientific im- 
possibility. That the higher realities are not phe- 
nomenal ' fact, ' but the things which concern the 
'buried life,' the sub-conscious self of direct 
emotional appreciation of meanings ; that these 
objects of faith, incapable of taking the form of 
an exact logical system of knowledg^e, yet need 
deepening and purifying bj' the giving of an out- 
let to the imprisoned waters; and that thought— 
philosophy— is one of the ways of attaining this, 
conduct and poetry being the other two; that 
the method of philosophy is the imagination 
working imder the supervision of reason to cre- 
ate an ideal hypothesis that shall provide for the 
satisfaction of the heart's desires; that the test 
of philosophic trutli lies finally in its capacity 
to be re-absorbed into those depths of uncon- 
scious spirituality in which truth loses itself in 
reality, its value in the quickening it gives to 
this inner life,— these are some of the significant 
points of the teaching of the essay, put with real 
insight and much felicity of expression. Or, to 
sum it up in brief, 'The function of Philoso- 
phy is to interpret and justify to man's reason 
the imconquerable optimism of his heart.'— Mr. 
Raymond St. James Perrin's work entitled 'The 
Evolution of Knowledge' (Baker & Taylor Co.) 
is a review of the history of philosophy— cul- 
minating in G. H. Lewes— which is intended to 
justify the author's own philosophic faith. This

is summed up in the generalization that ultimate 
reality is motion, to which mind and matter alike 
are to be reduced, and of which space and time 
are tlie objective and subjective aspects. As his- 
tory, the treatment is too scrappy to be of first- 
rate value, and the author's inability to interpret 
other men's thoughts except in the light of his 
own scientific dogmatism makes his exposition 
one-sided and at times inaccurate. His construc- 
tive philosophy would perhaps be more convincing 
if he had not stopped with assertions, but had at- 
tempted something in the way of proof, or at 
least had given evidence of recognizing the need 
of an adequate analysis of his conceptions. 

More words of Those who have enjoyed Pastor 
counsel from Charles Wagner's earlier books 
Pastor Wagner, ^j^ need no reviewer's commenda- 
tion to induce them to read his latest publication, 
Mustice' (MeClure, Phillips & Co.), in Miss 
Mary Louise Hendee 's fluent and apparently care- 
ful translation. Yet it must be admitted that 
these new chapters contain little that is essen- 
tially new to those familiar with the volumes 
that have preceded. The title cannot be called 
strikingly apposite, although the spirit of toler- 
ance is in a general way the main theme of the 
book. *A disposition to unfairness, bad faith, 
and evil-speaking, is abroad in every field,' says 
the author in his preface, 'and a matter over 
which men do not contend at daggers drawn, is 
hard to find.' To counteract this evil the little 
book teaches the lesson of sweet reasonableness 
and Christian charity. Of patriotism, as distinct 
from chauvinism, or jingoism, we read,— 'Just 
as I honour the memory of my father in the grey 
hair of a stranger, and understand every father's 
heart through the tenderness I bear my children, 
so do I honour my country in honouring the 
country of others. Wherever this respect is 
wanting, the quality of patriotism should be mis- 
trusted.' Many equally sensible utterances could 
be quoted. But as these excellent booklets of M. 
Wagner issue in quick succession from the press, 
the query will intrude itself. Are such reitera- 
tions of good counsel the things most needed by 
us and most praiseworthy in the writer? Is there 
not some danger lest 'nursed by mealy-mouthed 
philanthropies,' we 'divorce the Feeling from 
her mate the Deed'? Are we not perhaps in- 
dulging just a little too freely in those flaccid 
sublimities so alluring to the imaginative and 
emotional seeker for spiritual quickening? With 
more time allowed us to ponder and to live up to 
the author's earlier teachings, may it not be bet- 
ter for us and work no detriment to the popular 
French preacher's fame in the end? 

A delightful Since Marjorie Fleming wrote the 
girl's diary of ill-spelled pages of her delightful 
olden time. journal, no child's diary has been 

published more fascinating, because none have 
been more unconscious or sincere, than ' The Diary 
of a Girl in France in 1821' (Dxitton), in which 
Mary Browne wrote an account of the 121 days 
of her life during which she went from her home 
in Cumberland to Paris, and returned to Tallan- 



tire. She was then but fourteen years old (her 
life closed in early womanhood), but she was 
already a very unusual person, with great gifts 
of observation and expression, a passionate love 
of all things English, and a total and very en- 
gaging lack of humor. One can imagine her as 
shy and silent— even among her closest friends, 
and more at home with her pen and pencil than 
with them. Every day she wrote her painstaking 
chronicle of what she had seen and heard, mak- 
ing the most of the smallest things, and so en- 
abling us, eighty-four years after the entries were 
made, to see a hundred things we had not known 
before. We had thought ourselves at home at 
Meurice's Hotel, so often have the writers of 
the older days taken us hither; but did we know 
that the floors were boarded, and the furniture 
covered with blue cotton-velvet? Who else has 
told us that nearly thirty yeai^s after the TeiTor, 
the eyes of the Duchesse d'Angonleme 'were red, 
as if she had been crying'? It is some slight 
consolation to know that even so long ago, dress- 
makers were a disappointing race, although we 
are not likely to find one so frank as was the 
Madame who assured Mrs. Browne that 'it was 
not her nature to lie, but only her profession.' 
Surely no lodging-house could hope for tenants 
now-a-days if 'there were a great many toad- 
stools in the closet, and an ant's-nest below the 
floor.' Innumerable prim, childish wash-draw- 
ings illustrate the text, and form a valuable 
chronicle of vanishing peasant-types. 



Some modem In 1879, the Hon. William Bross 
interpretations of Chicago placed in the hands of 
of the Bible. ^Yie trustees of Lake Forest Uni- 
versity the sum of $40,000, the income of which 
should be used for the purpose of stimulating 
the production of the best books or treatises 'on 
the connection, relation, and mutual bearing of 
any practical science, or the history of our race, 
or the facts in any department of knowledge, 
with and upon the Christian Religion.' The sec- 
ond series of lectures on this Bross Foundation 
was delivered in 1904 by Professor Marcus Dods, 
of New College, Edinburgh; and they are now 
published as Volume II. of 'The Bross Library,' 
under the title 'The Bible: Its Origin and Na- 
ture' (Scribner). In seven succinct chapters, 
Dr. Dods surveys the troublesome questions that 
fall within his horizon. These problems have as- 
sumed an entirely different aspect within the last 
quarter-century, due to the marvellous advance 
in modem thought and in literary criticism. The 
author's liberality of mind and his openness 
toward all new advances in theological and bibli- 
cal learning are apparent on every page. He 
exhibits such good sense and candor in turning 
over and over the large problems of biblical criti- 
cism, thought evolution, and the practical value 
of Bible truth, that the reader soon follows him 
as he would a guide who thoroughly understands 
the road. Dr. Dods treats 'inspiration' and 'mir- 
acles,' and the historical character of the gospels, 
as one who is in full sympathy both with^ Gospel 
truth and with the man who is searching for

light on these problems. His spirit is not simply 
one of tolerance for the other side of the ques- 
tion, but full of winning power, of persuasive- 
ness, and of a reasonableness that is cognizant 
of the best progressive thought of the times. 

Music in the ^ ^00^ by Mr. E. W. Naylor, with 
spacious times of the queer title * An Elizabethan 
great Elizabeth. Virginal Book' (Button), proves 
on examination to be a critical essay on the con- 
tents of a manuscript in the Fitzwilliam Museum 
at Cambridge. The book is interesting to the 
student of musical history, as it contains exam- 
ples of every kind of music that was current dur- 
ing the Tudor Period in England. Over thirty 
composers of the day are represented, and the 
collection is more correctly regarded as a library 
than as a mere book; it contains more direct 
knowledge of the musical practice of Tudor times 
than most of us have of the music of our own 
century. The author states that his work is in- 
tended for two distinct classes of readers— first, 
students of the history of music who have access 
to the published Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, but 
have been prevented from giving it the attention 
it deserves, by reason of its great size and vari- 
ous contents; second, students of the Elizabethan 
and Jacobean Drama, who daily increase in 
numbers, and are often at a loss for musical 
illustrations such as are necessary for the repre- 
sentation of these works on even a humble scale. 
Mr. Naylor has shown himself to be more than a 
mere antiquarian; while the method of his book 
is simple, he appears as an industrious and pains- 
taking writer. It is a valuable work of reference, 
for it embodies all that can be required by one 
who is desirous of gaining a clear idea of the 
music of this interesting period. 

Timely studies Of the many books upon China 
of Chinese life axid the Chinese which have been 
and character. brought out from time to time as 
that particular phase of the ever-recurrent 'East- 
ern Question' has come into special prominence, 
none is so replete with valuable information with- 
in small compass as the third volume of Put- 
nam's 'Our Asiatic Neighbors' series, on 'Chinese 
Life in Town and Country,' adapted from the 
French of Emile Bard by H. Twitchell. The view- 
point of the author is distinctly French, and it 
is that of a man of affairs, four years resident in 
the country, with abundant opportunities for 
travel, reading, and observation, all of which 
have been intelligently improved. Evidently his 
reading has been chiefly in the work of the French 
missionary. Abbe Hue, which appeared in 1862, 
and from which, and the Peking 'Gazette,' the 
oldest newspaper in the world, his most extensive 
quotations are made. The book has no air of 
hasty generalization; the chapters, though brief, 
are full of information, set forth in the clearest 
possible manner, and the whole book, despite the 
strangeness and even repellant character of some 
of the Chinese customs, exemplifies the truth of 
the Italian proverb to the effect that all the world 
is like one's own family. 



Origin and The violin, according to Miss Olga 
development Racster in her book of 'Chats on 
of the violin. Violins' (lippincott), has reached 
its present perfection through imitation, or per- 
haps heredity; nothing tends to point to the in- 
strument as the invention of any one man. From 
Mereurie's invention of the lyre played with 
a plectrum came the first idea of three or 
more strings on one instrument. From the mon- 
ochord invented in the third century by Claudes 
Ptolemeus came the first idea of a peg by which 
to regulate the tension of the strings; from the 
Rebec, six centuries later, came the first idea of 
a finger-board, and the foundation of the pitch 
of the first three strings of the fiddle; from the 
Crouth came the first idea of the ribs. Finally, 
from the early viols, which first appeared in the 
fifteenth century in Germany, came the crude out- 
line of the violin. Bulky and heavy-looking as 
were these early viols, yet one can distinctly trace 
in them a noble striving toward the graceful 
curves of the perfect Stradivarius form. His- 
torical and biographical sketches of Italian and 
German makers are followed by an interesting 
chapter on the manner of preserving and playing 
the violin ; and an appendix is devoted to the life 
and anecdotes of Paganni. Miss Racster 's treat- 
ise is clear and concise, and not of such a technical 
nature as to burden the ordinary reader.

executor. It is requested that persons having let- 
ters of Hearn 's will kindly communicate with the 
editor at Na. 4 Park Street, Boston. 

A new and enlarged edition of Hay and Nicolay 's 
collection of the writings of Abraham Lincoln is 
announced for early publication by a new firm of 
New York publishers, the Francis D. Tandy Com- 
pany. The very considerable amount of impor- 
tant new material that has come to light since 
the original issue of this work will be included, 
and besides a general introduction by Mr. Richard 
Watson Gilder, each of the eleven volumes will 



contain some noteworthy tribute to Lincoln's 
genius, chosen from the utterances of famous wri- 
ters and statesmen of the past quarter-century. 
Numerous illustrations, editorial notes, a bibliog- 
raphy, and an index will be included. 

Mr. D. B. Updike announces the establishment 
of a bindery at The Merrymount Press under the 
charge of Mr. Peter Verburg, whose work is al- 
ready favorably known in Chicago and New York. 
Mr. Verburg, who studied some time ago under Mr. 
Douglass Cockerell, was at one time an associate 
of Miss Starr in her bindery at Hull House, Chi- 
cago, and later on was employed by Mr. Ralph 
Randolph. Adams at his bindery in New York. 

To their successful 'New Century Library' 
Messrs. Thomas Nelson & Sons have just added the 
complete works of Shakespeare, in six volumes. 
The edition is of pocket size, clearly printed and 
attractively bound, with a frontispiece illustration 
in each volume. The paper used in the 'New Cen- 
tury Library' is especially to be commended; while 
extremely thin and light, it does not offer the same 
difficulty in regard to turning the leaves that is 
so serious an objection to many of the thin-paper 
editions. 

Lovers of fine bookmaking, no less than lovers 
of good poetry, should be interested in the an- 
nouncement of Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. concerning 
the forthcoming collected edition of Mr. Bliss Car- 
man's Poems. The edition will be limited to 350 
copies, printed in red and black throughout at the 
Chiswick Press, London, on hand-made paper pre- 
pared by Messrs. Arnold & Foster especially for this 
work. The collection has been compiled from Mr. 
Carman's various published works, supplemented by 
a large number of poems which have already ap- 
peared in periodicals, but which are now included 
in a book for the first time. 

Dr. J. Chotzner, late Hebrew tutor at Harrow, is 
the author of a collection of essays on subjects 
pertaining to Hebrew literature, which have been 
combined into a volume and published under the 
title 'Hebrew Humor, and Other Essays' (London: 
Luzac & Co.). The hvimor and satire in the writings 
of Jewish scholars, ancient and modern, forms the 
leading theme of many of the articles. The most 
interesting and complete papers are those dealing 
with Mediaeval Writers, Immanuel di Roma, and 
Leopold Zunz. The form is generally biographical, 
citation taking the place of criticism to a large ex- 
tent. This detracts from the literary value of the 
essays, while adding to their usefulness as a refer- 
ence collection. The volume will be of service to 
Jewish rabbis and writers, and to others who de- 
sire a survey of this interesting subject.

APPLETONS' NEW BOOKS 



THE RECKONING 

By ROBERT W. CHAMBERS 

Illustrated. i2mo. Ornamental Cloth, ;^i.50 
Mr. Chambers has surpassed himself in telling the tale of the love of Carus Renault and 
Lady Elsin Grey in this historical novel of the last days of the Revolutionary War. Never 
was there daintier heroine or more daring hero. Never did the honor of a great-hearted 
gentleman triumph to such an extent over the man. Never vv^ere there daintier love passages 
in the midst of war. It is a book to make the pulses throb and the heart beat high. 



A Romance of the Oil Trust 

THE GIANTS 

By MRS. FREMONT OLDER 

i2nno. Ornamental Cloth, $1.50 
This is a glorious book. It is strong, strong. 
It keeps the reader tingling with excitement. It is 
big. Mrs. Older is the first writer who has shown 
the power to portray as big a thing as the Oil Trust 
in fiction. The interest of the fight between the 
hero and the Oil Trust is so intense that the heart 
beats fast and the breath comes short as one reads.

Bernard St. Armand was a brave man. Yvonne 
de Feyrolles was a brave maid. A stratagem ! An 
intrigue ! The Emperor's return ! The march to 
Paris ! The flight of Louis XVIII. ! The "Little 
Corporal!" The Plot! The arsenal! The ab- 
duction ! The rescue ! Waterloo ! Love ! 



THE SECOND FRENCH EMPIRE 

By Dr. THOMAS W. EVANS 
Edited by Dr. E. A. Crane. Illustrated. 8vo. Ornamental Cloth, $3.00 net, postage additional. (In a box.) 

Dr. Evans was the American dentist who aided the Empress Eugenie in her escape from Paris after Sedan. 
He was a personal friend of the Emperor, and paints an intensely vivid, human, and touching picture of the 
fallen great people and their times. 

Dr. Evans was intimate not only with the Emperor and Empress, but with all the celebrities who came 
to the French court. He was always a guest of honor at the grand functions, and describes everything with 
a minute faithfulness. The book is of great historical interest and value, and throws new light on the char- 
acters of both the Emperor and Empress.

De Luxe Edition, izmo. Decorative Cover, Silk 
Lining, End Pieces, and 8 full page Colored Illus-

additional. (In a box.) 

These well-known poems, with the swing and 
go and the bigness of them, the salt sea air and the 
hungry waves, the humanity and the grim humor of 
them, are presented in a new and attractive form. 
The book has a beautiful cover design, silk lining, 
end pieces, and eight full-page colored illustrations. 
Every page is surrounded by borders, and the whole 
color effect is in shades of green.

The novel appears in a dress worthy of the 
stately courtesy of the book and of old Montreal

that time cannot destroy. It will be a beautiful 
present for all lovers of books.

NOTEWORTHY FALL BOOKS 



THE LAND OF THE STRENUOUS LIFE 

By ABBE FELIX KLEIN 
With Portraits and Views. Price, $2.00 net. 

" The Abb^ is a man of fine culture, and a wide awake observer. Best of all, his whole book 
breathes a freshness and a joy of living that quite apart from its subject matter are decidedly 
engaging. The already established popularity of the work in France is indicated by the fact that 
it passed into a seventh edition a few months after its publication, and it has received from the 
French Academy the Montyon prize. The good literaiy style of the English version, made by the 
Abb^ himself, and the highly entertaining character of the narrative, will no doubt make it a 
favorite in this country also." — The Dial. 

HISTORIC ILLINOIS 

The Romance of the Earlier Days By RANDALL PARRISH 

With 50 Illustrations from Photographs. Price, $2.50 net. 

No State of the Union surpasses Illinois in the romantic incident and the continual chain of 
stirring events of its early days. Realizing that the history of this State affords splendid 
material for romantic treatment, Mr. Parrish, in presenting the historical occm-rences, the legends 
and traditions of the past, offers a most fascinating and vivid narrative. The author does not 
attempt to claim that his book is an exhaustive history of Llinois; it has been his aim rather to 
present points of historical interest in a manner which he believes should prove almost as interesting 
as any romantic fiction. The book is written in Mr. Parrish's most cliaracteristic manner, and it 
wUl be easily imagined that with a subject of this kind to deal with, we find the author of "When 
Wilderness Was King" in his element.

tion of the innumerable beauties and virtues of French family and school life. Nothing more 
interesting or valuable in this particular field has been published in some time." — Denver Republican. 

" Miss Betham-Edwards's ' Home Life in France ' is a book that was needed. One might read a 
dozen histories of France and not get so real and intimate an acquaintance with the French people 
as from a book like this." — Chicago Daily Tribune.

NOTEWORTHY FALL BOOKS 



WITH SHELLEY IN ITALY 

Being a Selection of the Poems and Letters of Percy Bysslie Shelley which have to do 
with his Life in Italy from 1818 to 1822. 

Selected and arranged by ANNA BENNESON McMAHAN 
With over sixty full-page Illustrations. Price, $1.40 net. 
It is impossible to think of Shelley without associating him with Italy. It was during the Italian 
period of his life that his genius matured, and it was the atmosphere and surroundings of that 
coimtry which inspired him to produce such masterpieces as " Prometheus Unbound," " Ode to the 
West "Wind," and •' The Cenci." But it is not only in his verse that Shelley has celebrated Italy, 
but also in his descriptions which have been handed down to us in the shape of letters. It has been 
the author's aim in this volume to present the poems in their original environment, and to conduct 
the reader into that very atmosphere where they were created. This she has attempted by means of 
illustrations, and also by letters and passages from note-books, which are arranged with the poems, 
so that the latter may be seen in the making. This is the object of the volume, and the idea, 
which has been most successfully carried out, makes a book of exquisite charm and unique interest. 
Special attention is called to the Large Paper editions, which are of extreme beauty, and meet 
all the requirements of a handsome gift hook. The text is printed on Italian hand-made paper, 
and the iZlustrations in broum ink on Japan paper. The book is bound in gray cloth with an 
eiTibossed fleur-de-lis design and vellum, ha/ik. Price, $3.75 net. The same in full vellum, $5.00. 
The same bound in Florence, parchment, antique style, Florentine ha,nd-illum,ination, $10.00 net. 

LIFE OF OMAR AL-KHAYYAMI 

By J. K. M. SHIRAZI 
Price, $1.50 net. 

The author of this life of the poet-astronomer is a Persian who has had access to many i*are manu- 
scripts existing in the libraries of private persons in Persia, which are practically inaccessible to 
Em'opeans. From these he has gathered many interesting facts which will be of great value to 
students of Omarian literature. The author has a particularly graceful style, and the handsome 
way in which the book is produced — the cover, title page, and chapter headings representing hand 
Ulumination in the Pei-sian stjde — make it one of extreme beauty. 

ARTS AND CRAFTS OF OLD JAPAN 

By STEWART DICK

THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN 

By BOOTH TARKINQTON 

This is unquestionably the best story Mr. Tarkington has yet produced. The scheme is laid in a 
little Indiana town, where, despite the unpretentious setting, a stirring drama is enacted. In Ariel 
Tabor, Mr. Tarkington has drawn a charming and unconventional heroine ; in Joe Louden we have 
a splendid character whose triumjih over adversity is a stubborn, hard-fought, and intensely inter- 
esting battle. Altogether, it is a perfect example of the thoroughly American novel in which Mr. 
Tarkington has notably surpassed all his former work. 

Illustrated. Price, $1.50. 

THE DEBTOR 

By MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN 

This popular author, whose New England tales have touched the hearts of thousands of readers in 
a way that few books have done, has in this novel drawn a hero of no common sort, and his cheq- 
uered career is appealingly portrayed. It is a searching study of character and also a well-told 
tale — told in the true Mary E. Wilkins style. There is here a love story of the most alluring 
type, whUe the unusual fortunes of " the debtor " are sure to be followed with eager interest. 

Illustrated. Price, $1.50. 

CAROLINE OF COURTLANDT STREET 

By WEYMER JAY MILLS 

A captivating tale of old New York, breathing the very spirit of comedy. The novel strategy of 
" Caroline " and its romantic outcome is brilliantly conceived and charmingly written. With the 
daintiest of bindings, delicate marginal decorations, and full-page illustrations in color. 

Illustrated in color by Anna Whelan Betts. Crown octavo, gilt top, iincut edges, marginal decorations in

LONDON FILMS 

By W. D. HOWELLS 

Mr. Howells carried a keen and appreciative mental kodak with him during his recent sojourn in 
London, and the record of the impressions made upon him by the great city shows this admirable 
writer in his happiest vein. His delightful talk about London is most ejigag^ng. He draws illumi- 
nating and humorous contrasts between New York and the English metropolis, chatting delightfully 
of London weather, the street sights and noises, his rambles about town, the parks and churches, 
and his adventures with English lodgings and hansoms. The commentary is written in masterly 
style and enlivened with mvich humor and agreeable bits of gossip.

A HISTORY OF OUR OWN TIMES 

(Volumes IV. and V.) 

By JUSTIN McCarthy 

In these new volmnes (IV. and V.) the author carries his admirable history from the Diamond 
Jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria to the accession of Edward VII. This is one of the very 
few histories that deserve a place also as literature. The author is master of a vigorous, yet smooth 
and lucid, style, and he is especially happy in his portraiture of the various statesmen, reformers, 
authors, and scientists whose lives figure prominently in the times of which he writes.

The ripest achievement of two recognized authorities, one a 
foremost scholar, the other one of the most distinguished 
critics of the day. 



In its scrupulous exactness the work does not lose sight of the 
fascinating human side of its subject. It tells not only who 
the writer was and what he wrote, but what he looked like, 
where he lived, who were his teachers, who his pupils, what 
his hand-writing was, and how he appeared in caricature to 
his contemporaries. 

The illustrations are a supremely important feature of the 
work. One critic remarks : " To turn these pages is like visit- 
ing a museum of old manuscripts and paintings, and it is need- 
less to say what a powerful instrument this is in making the 
subject vivid and raising the interest." It is almost impossible 
to find a page without some document of great interest or value. 

The appeal of this work must not be misunderstood. It is not 
confined to any class or section. It is impossible for anyone 
to open it and not find something to hold him interested as 
few story books can.

THE MAN OF ONE BOOK. 



After reading for upwards of a score of 
years, with stimulus and profit, the editorial 
columns of the Xew York * Evening Post' 
and ' Nation,' we have been impressed, per- 
haps more than by any other single feature, 
with the editor's frequent and apposite quo- 
tations from Burke. Both for the pointing of 
political morals and the adornment of instruc- 
tive tales, the great Irish statesman and orator 
has been drawn upon for the final word of 
wisdom, and his armory seems never to have 
failed to supply the needed argumentative 



weapon. Upon countless occasions we have 
admired the effectiveness of the instrument and 
the deftness of its use, and marvelled at the 
sagacity of the writer whose words have been 
found thus to anticipate the exigencies of 
political conditions widely different from any 
that came within the range of Burke's own 
experience. We have been well aware that 
this felicitous modem use of an eighteenth- 
century treasury of counsel and apophthegm 
was the result of the late E. L. Godkin's inti- 
mate familiarity with the thought of the man 
whom, more than any other, he had chosen 
as his mentor, and it is a noteworthy tribute 
to Mr, Godkin's personality that the tradi- 
tion thus fixed by him should continue to be 
illustrated (as is the case) by his editorial 
associates and successors. An influence and a 
tradition of similar nature may be found in 
recent British journalism of the more dignified 
type, and in tiiis instance it is clearly trace- 
able to the editorial activities of Mr, John 
Morley, who had likewise sat long at the feet 
of the same Irish Gamaliel, and entertained 
for him the same whole-hearted admiration. 

The English writer who deals with ques- 
tions of political philosophy is fortunate in- 
deed in thus being able to find texts for every 
manner of political discourse in the pages of 
a single approved classic. Burke is the most 
pronounced example of the political sage to be 
found in English literature, probably in any 
modern literature. Even the Frenchman, 
proud of the glory of Montesquieu and Vol- 
taire, must yield the palm to the Englishman 
in this; and the German is nowhere. This 
tribute to a great thinker by no means im- 
plies that Burke was always right, or that his 
vision was not sometimes darkened by preju- 
dice, but it does mean that his wise utter- 
ances vastly outnumbered his unfortunate ones, 
and that he had, beyond almost all other po- 
litical philosophers, the gift of impressive and 
pregnant expression. 

We do not intend, however, to write an essay 
upon Burke at the present moment, and we 
have invoked his name for the sole purpose of 
illustrating what benefits may accrue to the 
*man of one book' — if the book be big 
enough — who knows his author through and 
through. To be a 'man of one book' in the 
right sense is not to be a narrow-minded per- 
son or one subservient to another's thought, 
for such a man may have the widest range of

acquaintance with literature and the broadest 
of intellectual sympathies. But it means that 
some one great writer has become his fa- 
miliar, almost in the old superstitious sense, 
and is ever at his ear with whispered prompt- 
ings and words of counsel, and phrases which 
may fitly clothe the idea struggling for ex- 
pression. We all have occasion to acknowledge 
this kind of debt to literature in general, but 
that is not quite the same thing as finding 
the obligation concentrated in a single gen- 
erous creditor. The random inspirations that 
come to the mind of eclectic tendencies do not 
contribute to the upbuilding of as solid and 
consistent a framework of thought as do those 
that originate in a single source. It is a 
question, not so much of the particular idea, 
which may possibly be a wrong one, as of 
the general intellectual temper that comes 
from reliance upon the teachings of some one 
master. 

This habit of 'tying', as it were, to one 
of the great writers provides the reason with 
a regulative principle that will avail to steady 
it. in many a critical moment. The Bible, of 
course, has served more largely than any other 
writing in this controlling relation, and, par- 
ticularly with Englishmen, has been found 
an unfailing thesaurus of wisdom fitly ex- 
pressed for application to the conduct of life. 
Indeed, as Green so eloquently pointed out, 
the whole English nation was made a nation 
of one book by its devotion to the sacred 
Scriptures during the period from the Eefor- 
mation to the Restoration. Countless English- 
men in later times have 'tied' to Shakes- 
peare in much the same fashion, finding him 
adequate to the full measure of their spir- 
itual needs. Plato and Aristotle, Cicero and 
Horace, among the ancients, have numbered 
their disciples in all subsequent ages; while 
among the moderns, Bacon and Montaigne 
have had each his grateful personal following. 
Those of us who require the thought that par- 
ticularly moves us to have something of the 
color of life as it exists in our own age may 
prefer to sit at the feet of some master whose 
eyes have looked upon a world not unlike 
that in which we now live; for such, the 
teachings of Carlyle and Emerson, of Schopen- 
hauer and Kenan, have served as satisfying 
gospels. The chief desideratum for the in- 
dividual is that he attach himself to some 
thinker of sufficient distinction to provide him 
with intellectual ballast at need, yet that he 
at the same time preserve his own individ- 
uality, reacting upon the other's thought, not 
content with its reproduction in feeble echo. 

Our opening illustration was concerned with 
the application of this principle to the worker 



in political philosophy. Our closing words 
shall take the form of an inquiry concerning 
its possible application to literary criticism. 
In other words, can the professional critic find 
anywhere among his predecessors so 'very 
worthy and approved' a master as to justify 
him in the sort of loyalty that the political 
philosopher is warranted in bestowing upon 
Burke? Put in this blunt form, the question 
must be answered with a negative. The an- 
cients are out of the question, for they did 
little more than establish the broader gener- 
alizations of criticism. Turning to the mod- 
erns, we think of Dryden and Boileau, and 
veject them as too narrowly associated with 
the seventeenth century. Voltaire and John- 
son also, oracles and prophets in their day, 
are too exclusively of the eighteenth century 
to interpret or illuminate the modes of thought 
in which the twentieth century frames its con- 
ception of literature. The Germans are per- 
haps more promising for our purpose, but 
their effectiveness suffers greatly from crabbed 
expression and an overplus of abstraction. 
Lessing was one of the wisest of critics, but 
hardly more serviceable than Aristotle for 
the countless special problems of modern crit- 
icism. Herder was far-rea<ihing in his ideas, 
but they have passed into the possession of 
men who have been able to give them a more 
striking utterance. 

There remains for consideration the great- 
est of all the Germans, the greatest of all 
the moderns since Shakespeare, the author of 
' Faust ' and ' Wilhelm Meister.' Goethe had 
a comprehensive philosophy of life and art. 
He lived midway between the two centuries 
which were two distinct worlds in their out- 
look, but for him they were not describable as 

' One dead. 
The other powerless to be born,' 

for he preserved what was vital in the classical 
spirit of the earlier age, uniting it in the 
synthesis of his genius with the spirits of 
romance and of science which were to breathe 
life into the age to come. He not only pro- 
duced the greatest literary work of the mod- 
ern world, but he wrote from the fulness of 
his knowledge more wisely, on the whole, about 
literature than any of his contemporaries or 
successors has written. We may admit that 
his criticism of literature was only incidental 
to his imaginative work, but we must also 
allow that in volume and weight it was suf- 
ficient to make him a guide who rarely fails 
to supply the needful word of illumination 
upon any fundamental literary matter, and 
whose sayings nearly always have the preg- 
nancy of content and the lucidity of form that 
are essential for the uses that we have been

holding in view. He seems, on the whole, 
to meet more closeW than any other modem 
writer of distinction the definition of a sage of 
letters, as that definition has been implied in 
the foregoing reflections. One who wishes to 
think and write clearly about literature could 
hardly do better, and might easily do worse, 
than pin his faith to the precepts of Goethe, 
and use his ipsissima verba for the adornment 
and conclusion of whatever literary argument 
may occupy the attention. 



THE SUPERNATURAL IN LITERATURE, 

Our benighted eighteenth-century ancestors 
called it machinery. They were rationalists 
and skeptics. Their literature was a litera- 
ture of social life. Their idea of Nature 
was the formal terraces and straight avenues 
of Versailles, the clipped hedges and mazes 
of Kew or Hampton Court. Mountains to 
them were horrid haunts of gloom; the ocean, 
merely the home of sea-sickness. But they 
were sound on the supernatural. They were 
mj-th-makers at heart. Voltaire, who believed 
m nothing, believed in ghosts for tragedy. 
Pope invented a graceful apparatus of sylphs 
for one poem, and a Goddess of Dulness and 
her court for another. The lyrical poets could 
not write a stanza without personifying a 
half-dozen abstract qualities. For poetry de- 
ploying all its forces, for the great epic, they 
thought that an array of contending gods and 
goddesses was a necessity which no sane per- 
son would question. Machinery it was for 
the most part that they succeeded in creat- 
ing, — a creaking, soulless work of puppets 
and pulleys; but their faith in it was a trib- 
ute to the highest instincts of mankind. They 
were right. Without the supernatural in some 
shape, great literature can hardly exist. 

Whatever is not touched by the imagina- 
tion, dies. And the imagination is almost a 
vassal of the supernatural. Mystery is its 
home, its haunt, its birthplace. From the 
beginning of time, the unexplainable facts 
of life, — generation, growth, decay, death, the 
process of the seasons, the omnipotence of the 
sun, the motions of the stars, the strangeness 
of beast-life, — have exercised the wits of man. 
His literature is largely a storehouse of 
guesses, dreams, delusions, in regard to those 
matters. 

The myth-making instinct persists down to 
our own day. Compelled by the prejudices 
of readers to cast aside old mythologies, our 
writers invent new ones out of their own 
heads. In Victor Hugo's ' Toilers of the 



Sea ' the ocean is the sentient, terrible, treach- 
erous antagonist of the man. In ' Notre 
Dame' he personifies a cathedral; and 'Les 
Miserables' is filled with sombre and sinister 
shapes, — the demonology of a great city. 
Thomas Hardy's 'Return of the Native* pro- 
jects a great waste of melancholy moorland 
as the overruling Providence of the piece. 
Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick' is the story 
of a supernatural whale, a veritable demon 
of the deep, which eludes, fights, and finally 
destroys its maddened hunter and his ship. 
Poe's whole work is an even more successful 
attempt than any of these to create, ab ovo, 
the elements of awe and mystery. 

But all such individual efforts after the 
supernatural are as a sandwich to a seventeen- 
course banquet compared with the great racial 
works of mythology and demonologv. Look- 
ing at the vast population of divinities, spir- 
its, ghosts, and the like, which first and last 
have been in being, one is thankful that they 
did not take up space or they would have in- 
fallibly crowded humanity off the earth. 

The literature of the spirit-world possibly 
begins with the Eamayana and the Mahah- 
harata. The vicinity of the greatest and 
most mysterious mountains of the world prob- 
abl}' accounts for the enormous though vague 
powers of the Hindoo divinities and demons. 
What accounts for the utter spirit of unreason 
which animates them and pervades also the 
actions of the human agents who come in 
contact with them, I cannot say. The super- 
natural elsewhere in the world is in some 
sense natural. There is a logic in its life, a 
measure in its miracles. But in the Indian 
poems it is wild, disordered, fluctuating, un- 
foreseen, — a chaotic dream. There are human 
figures and actions in these poems which are 
affecting, beautiful, magnificent; but they too 
are superior to any law. Hermits live a thou- 
sand years without food, or standing on one 
leg, and win thereby virtue which enables 
them to contend with the supreme deities. 
The blackest villains are invulnerable to gods. 
There is a monkey race whose powers trans- 
cend those of man. The Pandu brothers, in 
the Mahabharata, are at one moment beg- 
gars and suppliants, and the next they are 
panoplied in might and able to contend sin- 
gle-handed with armies. Possibly the Hindoo 
unreasonableness is the truest supernatural. 

Persian literature, at least in the Shah 
Xameh, does not greatly extend itself on the 
side of the supernatural. Sultans and heroes, 
it is true, live a thousand or fifteen hundred 
years. There is one king who has a snake 
growing out of his shoulders which had to be 
fed with the flesh of virgins. Bustem's seven

labors were largely expeditions against demons 
and powers of darkness. But the Persian 
imagination did not body forth a mythology 
with any great vigor. Possibly its great dii- 
alistic religion, the most philosophic religion 
of the world, crushed out minor .exhibitions of 
the divine or the demoniac. The same is true 
of the Arabs, who, genii, afreets, and ma- 
gicians, seem rather monotonous personages, 
Beckford's ' Vathek ' is really more Eastern 
than the Eastern tales and poems, in its tre- 
mendous energy of invention. 

It is a commonplace qf criticism, that the 
Greeks only projected their own pretty and 
harmonious persons into their Pantheon. 
Their mythology is a matter of ideals rather 
than of idols. Yet there was unquestionably 
a dark shadow to their sunny supernaturalism. 
One does not usually , associate ghosts and the 
Black Art with their imaginings, yet Apu- 
leius is full of rather grewsome witchcraft. 
There is a play of Plautus, imitated probably 
from Menander, which has to do with a haunt- 
ed house. Goethe's ^ Bride of Corinth' is 
the version of a Greek legend. 

The best part of the Pioman mythology, 
and the most fruitful for literature, was its 
humble rustic divinities — Faunus, Sylvanus, 
Priapus, the Lars and Lemures. The Latin 
Pantheon was filled with didactic deities who 
weighed upon poetry like lead. And later, 
during the Empire, when the great Eastern 
gods — the Magna Mater, the mysterious 
Mithra, Isis, Scrapis, and the dog-faced Ana- 
bis, entered Rome, in turn, in triumph, like 
an Imperator, they had little inspiration for 
literature. Possibly the rising power of Chris- 
tianity strangled their influence. 

For nearly two thousand years, Christianity, 
with its enormous mythology of spiritual and 
demoniac powers, its angelology, its hierar- 
chies of saints and martyrs, its miracles and 
its remissions of sins, has filled the civilized 
world and satisfied man's sense of awe and 
worship. It has touched all acts with a 
wand of life, and caused them to blos- 
som in prodigious efflorescence. The poems 
of Dante, Ariosto, Tasso, Spenser, and Milton, 
the Arthurian legends which it remodelled 
after its own image, the plays of Calderon and 
Shakespeare and Goethe and a myriad minor 
works, testif}^ to its power. No other spirit- 
ual influence has had a tithe of its ap- 
praisable effect. The Scandinavian mythology 
is a good rival of the Greek and Hindoo ones. 
The clear and beautiful Greek divinities would 
perhaps have scorned the one-eyed Wotan or 
the blacksmith-like Thor, but in a contest for 
sublimity those last would have it all their 
own way. 



Celtic imagination is supposed to have in- 
fluenced or moulded the Icelandic sagas, but 
the Celtic gods are very indifferent and un- 
impressive personages compared with those of 
the farther North, The Celtic supernatural 
comes out best as a kind of a glamor cast 
over Nature. It suffuses the visible world 
with magic, but hardly concentrates into fig- 
ures of commanding power. We know prac- 
tically nothing about the Druidic cult, but it 
looms large as a thing of awe and mystery, 
Scotland, down to modern times, is a land 
of bogles, witches, warlocks, and worrie-cows. 
Scott and Burns came into a great inherit- 
ance of the supernatural, which they bettered 
and enlarged. It is hardly realized how much 
Scott was dominated by the mystery and magic 
of the spirit world. No English author save 
Shakespeare has so felt its power. He was 
accused of having a Meg Merrilies in every 
one of his books, after that impressive figure 
was first created. But his early j)oems show 
the trend of his imagination quite as dis- 
tinctly. 

In the wake of the conquering hosts 
of Christian mythology, many superstitions 
sprang up throughout Europe, — survivors of 
the first or original denizens of wood and 
field. Venus, driven from Olympus, retired 
into the Venusberg — the Siren became the 
Lorelei. Of phantom tilings that seem to have 
originated in the middle ages, the Loup-garou 
and the Were-wolf were perhaps the most 
horrible. The French beast epics and fabliaux 
hardly come into the province of the super- 
natural, but they show man's instincts stirred 
by the strangeness of animal life — its like- 
ness to, yet removedness from, his own. 

Calderon has a figure in one of his plays 
called El Embozado, which has been the an- 
cestor of a long and distinguished line in lit- 
erature. In the original legend which Cal- 
deron used, a man is pursued wherever he 
goes by pieces of paper falling from the skies, 
on each of which he finds inscribed his own 
name. The hero of the play is haunted by a 
masked and cloaked figure which appears to 
him at all times and places. At last he turns 
upon it with his sword, — they fight, and the 
intruder falls to the ground. He removes 
the mask from its face, and beholds — him- 
self. There is a similar idea in a ballad of 
Gongora. A man is on his way to an assigna- 
tion with a nun. He meets a funeral cortege, 
and is inexplicably drawn to follow it. The 
train enters a lighted church; the coffin is 
placed before the altar, and mass is performed. 
Then the company silently files out, and the 
man advances and looks upon the face in the 
coffin. It is his own. Of course this idea

is the germ of such modern stories as Poe's 

* William Wilson ' and Stevenson's ' Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde.' 

The personages of Shakespeare's fairy com- 
•edy, Oberon, Titania, and Puck, had a long 
pedigree in the legends of the people. Robin 
Goodfellow, indeed, is the most characteristic 
English sprite. Queen Mab is supposed to be 
a reincarnation of Queene Meve of the great 
Irish epic c^'cle, though she must have 
changed marvellously in the course of cen- 
turies. The Witches of Lancashire were famous 
before Ainsworth wrote of them. 

The powers which mortals acquired by con- 
tact or contract with divinities or demons were 
very various. Faust received back his youth. 
The Scotch nobleman in the ' Legend of Mont- 
rose,' and the Bard in Campbell's 'Lochiel,' 
were experts at second-sight. The heroine of 
Rossetti's ' Rose Mary ' saw her lover's fate 
reflected in the Beryl Stone; the heroine of 
another of his ballads had the pleasant gift 
of making a man waste away as his wax image 
melted before a fire. Any friend of Asmodeus 
could have the roofs of houses lifted for him. 
Levitation, however, was the great gift of 
demonolog}'. The most prominent fact about 
witches was that they rode on broomsticks. 
One can shut one's eyes and see the air of 
Europe blackened with these beings, all making 
their wav to the Hartz mountain. As Goethe 

' The further northward one doth go. 
The plentier soot and witches grow.' 

I have sketched but an incomplete outline 
of this great subject. Volumes would be re- 
"juired to do justice to ghosts alone; and the 
<ioings and disguises of the Fiend himself 
would fill a library. What I have wished to 
show is the importance of the supernatural for 
literature. Perhaps we are better without it 
in life. I for one have no wish to revive com- 
l»acts with the Devil, or the burning of witches. 
But we can hardly have books that thrill and 
' iithrall, without some use of the things of the 
-pirit world. 

There has always been something in the air 
"f America as fatal to superstition as the soil 

• f Iceland is to snakes. After Ponce de Leon's 
'|UGst, and the witch-fires of Xew England, 
there is hardly a gleam of the supernatural in 
■ur historv. DeSoto's march to the Missis- 
-ippi in search of gold is emblematic of our 
]>rogress. Xothing, indeed, is more remarkable 
than the spectacle of a great people crush- 
ing its way over a continent, coming in con- 
tact with new scenes and strange experiences, 
yet evincing no excitement over the unknown, 
holding steadily to the practical and to the 
main chance. That is the reason why our 
national heroes are so impossible for poetry, — 



why our national literature is so thin. Daniel 
Boone would be as good a legendary hero 
as Siegfried, if his Ohio woods had harbored 
wormlike dragons, if gnomes had been his 
companions and water-sprites his guardians, — 
if, in short, he had been brought into some re- 
lation to the supernatural, Washington would 
he as good a central figure for a drama as 
Wallenstein, if like Wallenstein he had trav- 
elled with a train of astrologers and magicians. 
The Indians whom we have dispossessed were 
a more imaginative race than ourselves, and a 
large part of such elevation and grandeur as 
does inhere in our literature is due to them. 
Our classic writers, indeed, were keenly alive 
to the value of the supernatural, and seized 
every possibility in our life that would give 
them a background of darkness, an air of mys- 
tery. Their successoi^ have been in the main 
parochial and provincial. Their attitude tow- 
ard the great ideas of the world reminds me of 
a stor}- of a Aoung woman of my neighborhood. 
Being asked to accompany some friends to 
Eitrope, she- answered, hesitatingly, that she 
would like to go to Europe, she had heard a 
great deal of Europe, but she did hate to 
miss the Mt. Holly fair. 

But let us not give up hope. Americans 
are not really different from other people. 
They must thrill with hopes and fears for the 
future, they must consult the oracles of life 
and death. Under the shadow of our noble 
but rather prosaic Protestant religion, an 
undergrowth of superstitions is springing up. 
Prett}' urban or rural customs, which have their 
root in Pagan obsenances, are being revived. 
The Priestess of the Black Hills reads the 
stars for more folk than we imagine. Chiro- 
mancy, hypnotism, and mind-reading flourish. 
We have no witches who can alter the boun- 
daries of our properties in a night, but our 
Wizards of Finance seem to have inherited 
their gifts. Charlatans of both sexes claim 
miracidous powers of healing and receive amaz- 
ing credence. A young woman died in Phila- 
delphia not long ago who gave out that she 
was the bride of Christ. Her followers be- 
lieved in her to the extent of giving her a 
brick house. I have no desire to suggest that 
these things are good in themselves. But man 
must have some outlet into the unknown. We 
cannot live by bread alone, nor subsist on a 
mental diet of stock reports, eulogies of the 
world's work, and speeches of strenuous poli- 
ticians. Any change which will deepen our 
emotions and widen our intellects, must be for 
the better. And if such a change sets in, the 
literature which deals nobly with the super- 
natural must come into its own.

Backward Glances of a IjItebary 
Veteran.* 



'The uttered part of a man's life, let lis 
always repeat/ says Carlyle in his essay on 
Scott, ' bears to the unuttered, unconscious 
part a small unknown proportion. He himself 
never knows it, much less do others/ From 
this pregnant utterance, quoted on his title- 
page, Colonel Higginson takes the name which 
he gives to the collected form of those very 
enjoyable chapters of reminiscence, observa- 
tion, and reflection, that have of late been 
enlivening the pages of 'The Atlantic/ Two 
chapters have been added ('Una Hawthorne' 
and 'The Child and his Dreams'), as also 
many portraits and facsimile copies of letters. 
The best introduction the reviewer can give 
the book, to those still unfamiliar with its 
contents, is a generous selection of extracts 
from its pages. These ripe and scholarly 
chapters — ' ripe with the varied experience of 
eighty years and more, and scholarly with the 
scholarship of a lover not only of books, but 
of men — have an interest and value far ex- 
ceeding an3rthing that another pen might con- 
trive to say about them. 

The opening chapter, on 'The Sunny Side 
of the Transcendental Period,' contains an 
amusing definition of transcendentalism that 
must be new to many readers. Father Taylor's 
brilliant daughter, Mrs. Russell, characterized 
those ' Disciples of the Newness ' as ' a race 
who dove into the infinite, soared into the 
illimitable, and never paid cash.' The article 
closes with a tJiought-provoking query. 

'But one question still remains, and perhaps will 
always remain, unanswerable. Considering the part 
originally done by the English Lake Poets in bring- 
ing about this period of sunshine in America, why 
is it that the leaders of English literature on its 
native soil for the last half century have had a 
mournful and clouded tone? From Carlyle and Rus- 
kin through Froude and Arnold to Meredith, Hardy, 
Stevenson, and Henley, all have had a prevailing 
air of sadness, and sometimes even of frightful 
gloom. Even Tennyson, during at least a portion 
of his reactionary later life, and Browning to- 
ward the end of his, showed the same tendency. 
In America, on the other hand, during the same 
general period, the leading literary figures, with 
the solitary exception of Poe, — who was wont to 
be an exception to all rules, — were sunshiny and 
hopeful, not gloomy. This is certainly true of 
Emerson, Alcott, Thoreau, Longfellow, Lowell, 
Holmes, Whittier, Whitman. Even if Hawthorne 
may have seemed to the world an exception be- 
cause of his reticence and sombre bearing, we must 
remember how he laid aside those traits within his 
own household. "Never was there such a play-

mate," said to me once his noble and stately daugh- 
ter Una, describing her happy childhood. These 
and all the rest, save Poe, found joy, predominant 
joy, in life. Why this difference? It is not yet 
time, perhaps, to fathom the mystery and give a 
clear answer to the question.' 

Discoursing on English and American men- 
tal processes, with reference to their compara- 
tive quickness — an oft-discussed question, in 
which we have always believed in our own 
superiority — the author offers, among other 
observations, the following, in a chapter en- 
titled ' English and American Cousins ' : 

'People who go slowly on new ground may turn 
out to be quick enough when wholly at home with 
any particular line of thought. How odious and 
complicated, for instance, seems to an American 
observer the computation of pounds, shillings, and 
pence! It seems strange that any nation should 
consent for a day to employ anything but a decimal 
currency; yet with what lightning rapidity does a 
London bookkeeper make his computations! . . . 
Even in the House of Commons, the unlikeness to 
an American deliberative body is found to vary 
according to the point from which you look at the 
discussion. The Englishman begins with a curious 
air of hesitation, whereas the American glides into 
his speech at once; but the difference is that the 
Englishman suddenly surprises you by coming to 
his point with clearness and decision, after which 
he amazes you yet more by sitting down; whereas 
the American, after his first good hit, is apt to seem 
intoxicated by hie own success, and feels bound 
to keep on indefinitely, waiting for another. You 
are left under the impression that an ideal speech 
in any debating body would be achieved by hav- 
ing an American to begin it and an Englishman to 
end it.' 

' The Aristocracy of the Dollar ' contains a 
frank recognition of the evils of plutocracy, 
but also an encouraging view of its excellences, 
actual and possible; of which the author shall 
be allowed to speak in his own person. 

'The aristocracy based on the dollar has its own 
weaknesses and follies, but it has certain merits. Its 
first merit is that it belongs to the present, not to 
the past; it represents something that is being done, 
or has lately been done, whether for good or evil; 
not something which has long gone by. When Theo- 
dore Parker first visited Cincinnati, at that time 
the recognized leader among western cities, he said 
that he had made a great discovery, namely, that 
while the aristocracy of Cincinnati was unquestion- 
ably founded on pork, it made a great difference 
whether a man killed pigs for himself, or whether 
his father had killed them. The one was held 
plebeian, the other patrician. It was the difference 
Parker said, between the stick 'ems and the stuck 
'ems; and his own sympathies, he confessed, were 
with the present tense. It was, in other words, 
aristocracy in the making. It stood for a race 
which had found forests to be cleared, streams 
to be bridged, and roads to be built; the dollar 
was not only behind these forms of service, but it 
was the corner-stone of the schoolhouse and the 
church. It predicted a civilization which should 
belong to to-day, not to yesterday; and belonging 
to to-day, should also predict to-morrow.' 

The same spirit of reasoned optimism that 
animates this chapter also breathes in the

thoughtful pages that close the book and that 
treat of ' The Cowardice of Culture/ Colonel 
Higginson has lived long enough to discover 
that the ever-recurring plaint of the laudator 
temporis acti is not necessarily prophetic of 
the speedy end of all things. Even in the (to 
us) golden age. croakers were fond of chant- 
ing this same refrain, a fact that tends to 
surprise us as much as will our own jeremiads 
astonish the readers of them in the twenty-

which many persons of wealth and culture re- 
gard the granting of suffrage to the multitude, 
and meeting especially the scholar's complaint 
that his superior learning fails to get due 
rec-ognition at the polls, the author maintains 
that brains do count even in electoral contests. 

'If all the scholar's education in a republic gives 
him no infallible advantage over the man who 
cannot read or write, let the scholar have the man- 
liness not to whine over the results of his own 
inefficiency. How absurd would be any artificial 
system of equalization, such as we sometimes see 
gravely urged, which should give to the day laborer 
one vote, to the school-teacher two, to the lawyer 
or editor three, and to the author of a treatise on 
the United States Constitution ten! Natural laws 
provide much better for the end desired; the edu- 
cation of the editor, the lawyer, the teacher, should 
enable him to carry dozens of less educated votes 
at his belt, as an Indian carries scalps. It is he 
who writes the editorials, he who makes the 
speeches; all the machinery of conviction, for good 
or for evil, is intrusted to his hands. The political 
committee-man is the quartermaster of the regi- 
ment; he attends to the supplies and the encamp- 
ment, and if he neglects his duty, the work is ill 
done. Eating is essential to fighting, in the long 
run; but eating can never take the place of fight- 
ing, and the tone of the political campaign must 
be given by those who actually contend. "The 
glory of universal suffrage." said Louis Blanc to 
me once, "is in the power it gives to intellectual 
leaders; a man of trained intellect really throws 
not one vote, but a thousand.'" 

' History in Easy Lessons ' is an instructive 
essay for the teacher. The importance of vivid 
detail in engaging the young learner's atten- 
tion is pointed out. 

'Detail, the animation of detail, is what the 
young student needs. How inconceivably stiff and 
dreary seems to many a child the early Puritan 
life in New England, until he comes across some 
casual anecdote from which it suddently flashes 
upon him that those formal clergymen had a hu- 
man side. "Holy Mr. Cotton," for instance, how 
remcte and unapproachable he seems, until the fact 
suddenly comes into view, that this good man was 
pacing homeward in Boston, wrapped in his Geneva 
cloak, pondering on his next Sunday's sermon, when 
some ' ' street boys ' ' passing by — so the legend 
says, but can it be that there were "street boys" 
in those days? — were heard to whisper among 
themselves, "Let's put a trick upon old Cotton." 
Upon which, one boy, more daring than the rest, 
ran up behind him and shouted in his ear, "Cotton, 
thou art an old fool I" "I know it, I know it," 
shouted the old gentleman suddenly, "the Lord 
make both thee and me wiser," and then reverted 



to his meditations. Whole pages of fact com- 
mitted to memory had left the life of that time 
stiU dull and mechanical, but this single incident 
revealed to the schoolboy a human side.' 

The eleventh chapter, dealing with *The 
Close of the Victorian Epoch,' contains many 
reminiscences of notabilities with whom the 
author has comfe in contact. These recollec- 
tions, and others of the same sort in other 
parts of the book, drop from the writer's pen 
with no flourish of self-advertisement or accent 
of self-complacency. For this reason, if for no 
other, an excerpt will be welcome. Dr. Jowett 
shall be its subject. 

'The death of Doctor Jowett, Master of Balliol 
College, Oxford (1817-93), — whom it was the proper 
etiquette to address as "Master," — recalls associa- 
tions dear to American students because of his 
marvelous translation of Plato, with others, only 
less admirable, of Aristotle's "Politics," and of 
Thucydides. To me, personally, it also brings back 
the happy Commemoration Day at Oxford in 1878, 
when I sat at his dinner-table with the present 
Duke of Devonshire, Sir James Stephen, and oth- 
ers, and heard that singular mixture of sermoniz- 
ing and sharp retort which is so well preserved in 
Mallock's "New Bepublic." He appears there, it 
may be remembered, as "Dr. Jenkinson, '' and 
preaches an imaginary sermon which, it is said, 
annoyed the subject of the parody very much. 
Many are the stories yet told at Oxford of his 
abrupt and formidable wit. On one occasion, at 
one of his own dinner-parties, when the ladies had 
retired and a guest began at once upon that vein 
of indecent talk, which is, perhaps, less infrequent 
among educated men in England than in America, 
or is at least more easily tolerated there, Doctor 
Jowett is said to have looked sharply toward the 
offender, and to have said with a decisive polite- 
ness, "Shall we continue this conversation in the 
drawing-room?" He then rose from his chair, the 
guests all, of course, following, by which measure 
the offender was, so to speak, annihilated without 
discourtesy. * 

A good comparison of Darwin and Spencer 
is given, in which some of the Synthetic Phil- 
osopher's weaknesses are laid bare, especially 
that ' weakness of omniscience ' which betrayed 
its possessor into giving, promptly and unflinch- 
ingly, his opinion on all conceivable subjects, 
from astronomy to banking. * Those present 
at his farewell dinner in Xew York,' continues 
the author, 'still recall vividly the amusing 
effect produced by his cautioning his hearers 
against baldness as an outcome of the eager 
American life, whereas those who sat with him 
at the banquet seemed like an assemblage of 
highly bewigged men compared with the noto- 
riously bald-headed congregation of English 
barristers to be seen every Sunday at the Tem- 
ple Church in London.' 

Naturally, anti-slavery recollections are not 
wanting in Colonel Higginson's book, and in 
all matters pertaining to the negro question 
this whilom commander of a black regiment 
speaks with authority — especially in the chap-

odd and amusing epistolary efforts that the 
author's fame as a public character has brought 
to him in the course of a long lifetime, ' Books 
Unread' and 'Butterflies in Poetry' are dis- 
quisitions on literary themes. That he writes 
so engagingly and so refreshingly on such 
topics may be due to the fact that, while he 
is evidently something of a bookworm, he is 
altogether free from that disagreeable book- 
worminess which an exclusive devotion to books 
often engenders. Papers on ' Wordsworth-

rest of the book, to which a sufficient index 
has been added by some careful hand. The 
portraits and facsimiles are of interest, but are 
inserted without much apparent system, and 
sometimes with slight cause. For example, a 
chance reference to Victor Hugo's observation 
that the insect world is, with hardly an excep- 
tion, a world of silence, serves as an excuse for 
his portrait, which faces the passage in ques- 
tion. But no buyer of the book will quarrel 
with its publishers because they have given 
him more for his money than he had expected.

The Case of Russia.* 

All things Eussian are interesting to the 
world, now that the inner conditions of the 
huge empire have been revealed by the light- 
ning stroke of the Japanese war. While a 
few shrewd observers with exceptional ad- 
vantages for observation have been able to see 
below the surface and have told of inefficiency 
and rottenness, the most of us, even the states- 
men and students of affairs, have been de- 
ceived by the superficial show of strength that 
Russia has presented to the world, and she 
has been courted and deferred to as one of 
the mighty powers whose vast plans of con- 
quest and growth must not be interfered with. 
But two short years ago, Eussia seemed to be 
the destined mistress of the Far East and 
the possessor of a large part of China and 
of whatever else she would have. Xow her 
power has crumbled under the blows of a 
small despised Oriental power, which in shat- 
tering the prestige of Eussia has also awak- 
ened China to new life. 

The world is looking for the causes of these 
astonishing phenomena, and is not satisfied with 

* Russia and its Cbisis. By Paul Milyoukov. (Crane 
Lectures for 1903.) University of Chicago Press. 

Russia from Within. By Alexander Ular. New 
York : Henry Holt & Co. 



the superficial explanations offered by writers 
untrained in historical and economic investi- 
gation, or by enthusiasts with one idea. The 
phenomena are too large to be accounted for 
by such facts, however true, as the weakness 
of the Tsar and the corruption of the court. 

In the first of the books under consideration 
we have the results of long years of serious 
study of Eussian conditions at first hand by 
a man of ability and training. Professor Mil- 
youkov states his purpose in these Avords: 

'This book is not a political pamphlet written for 
the occasion, but a result of long years of study- 
devoted to the explanation of the Russian present 
by the Russian past. The present crisis in Russia 
necessarily commands attention, and everything dis- 
cussed in this work converges to the one aim of 
explaining this crisis. But the conditions that have 
brought on the crisis are so deeply rooted in the 
past, and are so closely interwoven with every 
aspect of Russian life, whether of religion or ot 
politics, of doctrines or of institutions, of social 
forms or of the composition of society, that an ex- 
planation of the present situation, to be at all 
adequate, must necessarily be a general picture of 
Russia and a general description of the conditions 
under which its civilization has developed. The 
crisis will pass, but the conditions of civilization 
remain; and my ambition has been to explain, not 
the momentary and the transient, but the perma- 
nent and the lasting, elements in the political, so- 
cial, and religious life of Russia.' 

The author carries out very satisfactorily the 
purpose that he had before him, and the book 
is one that must be studied by anyone who 
sets out to get a real knowledge of Russia. 
The lectures out of which the book has grown 
were delivered at the University of Chicago in 
1903, before the war began; and the author 
has since been called to deliver a course of 
lectures at the Lowell Institute in Boston. 
These facts guarantee his scholarly standing. 
The conclusions that he reached before the 
war he has seen no reason to modify since. 

The book is a substantial and satisfactory 
piece of work, giving the point of view of 
that branch of the Eussian liberal party known 
as the 'Intellectuals,' the real liberals of the 
country. Professor Milyoukov's activity in the 
cause of freedom has already led to exile, but 
there is nothing in this book of the intemper- 
ance of the professional agitator or the po- 
litical enthusiast. He possesses an intimate 
knowledge of his subject, and is fearless in 
expressing his opinions; and we feel through 
the whole discussion that he is sincere and 
is trying to Ijo fair. With ample knowledge,, 
training, and evident fairness, he is the best 
available guide to a knowledge of present con- 
ditions in Eussia from the historical point 
of view. 

One of the most interesting chapters for 
American readers is that in which the author 
elaborates his comparison between Russia and

the United States. There are also chapters 
on the Xationalistic Idea, the Eeligious Tra- 
dition, the Liberal Idea, the Socialistic Idea, 
the Crisis and the Urgency of Eeform, and a 
brief Conclusion. As these chapters run over 
a hundred pages each, and are solid with sig- 
nificant facts and reasoning on the facts, it- 
is manifestly impossible in a brief review to 
give even the baldest summary of them. There 
is a full analj-tical index, filling twent}--five 
pages, that will be very helpful to the student 
of Russian conditions and institutions, and six 
maps in color set forth graphically many facts 
important to the study of Hussian develop- 
ment. 

In striking contrast to the weighty and 
thorough discussion of Russian conditions con- 
tained in Professor Milyoukov's book is the 
superficial and unrestrained declamation of 
Mr. Ular in his attempt to account for Rus- 
sia's conditions and misfortunes. For him 
there is no historical background, no evolution 
of the present from the past. He says in 
his preface : * This book is an account of the 
general conditions prevailing at the outbreak 
of the Russian Revolution. In these the per- 
sonal action of the Executive — Tsar, Princes, 
Ministers, and Generals — is the capital factor. 
Analysis of this Executive was therefore in- 
cumbent on me, by juxtaposition of the most 
typical facts relating to its action.' Here we 
have the author's theory and method; and it 
is easy to see where it will lead us. His 
typical facts are mainly pathological ; he sets 
before us the whole royal connection for a 
hundred and fiity years back — ■ ' the Reigning 
Dynasty of Degenerates and Fools ' — as af- 
flicted with epileptic tendencies which mani- 
fest themselves in amnesia, mysticism, and 
cruelty, with megalomania, sexomania, tuber- 
culosis, morbid religiosit}-, mental incoherence, 
and degeneracy. This we have through eighty 
pages, one czar after another and one grand 
duke after another passing in procession before 
us. 

The grand villain of the book is Plehve, 
whose assassination is said to have been the 
opening scene in the Revolution. He was 
the incarnation of cruel repression, the head 
of a system whose ramifications reached every 
hamlet and almost every house in the vast 
empire; but Witte, with his financial and 
economic reforms, and Pobiedonostseff. the re- 
ligious autocrat and reactionist, receive their 
share of denunciation. The final chapter, on 
the National Awakening, runs through the list 
of petty subject nationalities, showing how in 
each a new spirit is rising wliich will con- 
tribute to make irresistible the Revolution that 
is now upon the empire. The book is not 



^vithout value for him who can sift the facts 
from the fiction and the denunciation; but it 
is altogether untrustworthy, and cannot but 
mislead the untrained reader.

War-time Memories of a Coxfed- 
ERATE's Daughter.* 



The title of Mrs. D. Giraud Wrighfs 'A 
Southern Girl in '61 ' is somewhat misleading, 
in that it implies a book of reminiscences of 
Southern social life on the eve of the Civil 
"War ; whereas we find in the volume little about 
the * Southern Girl ' and not much about ' '61,' 
and only casual glimpses of Confederate home- 
life. However, the omission may well be over- 
looked, sinc-e the social side of Confederate 
history has been prettj- well exploited recently 
by Mrs. Clay and Mrs. Pryor, and in Mrs. 
Chesnufs Diary; while the volume under re- 
view has an interest and value that the social 
histories have not. The author, as Miss Louise 
Wigfall, was the daughter of Louis T. Wigfall 
of South Carolina and later of Texas, who rep- 
resented the latter state in the United States 
Senate until secession came, when he was trans- 
ferred to the Confederate Senate. He served 
the Confederacy not only in the legislative 
halls but also in the field at the head of a 
brigade of Texans. 

The contents of the volume are surprisingly 
varied, when one considers that the writer was 
a seventeen year old school-girl when the war 
began. The account opens with a description 
of the family life in Texas and later in Wash- 
ington, and of her own school-days in New 
England. Then follow character-sketches and 
descriptions of the prominent Confederate 
leaders, among them Davis, Breckenridge, 
Benjamin, Hunter, and Wigfall. Most of the 
book is made up of the public and private 
correspondence of Senator Wigfall and his 
familv. The last chapters describe the life of 
the author while a member of General Joe 
Johnston's household after he was relieved from 
command at Atlanta, and the book closes with 
a description of the escape of the Wigfall family 
from beleaguered Richmond, and the slow and 
painful return to Texas. 

The personal experiences of the youthful 
daughter of Senator Wigfall are subordinated 
to accounts of matters of public policy, etc. 
But she does give a charming description of 
Texas, and of life there in the fifties. Her 
Texas and the Texas of Olmsted are very dif-

ferent places; the two writers saw from dif- 
ferent view-points. Through contemporary 
letters and vivid narration we are given an 
insight into the feeling at the North in 1861, 
as it appeared to two school-girls from the South 
lingering unwillingly in a hostile country. A 
thrilling experience was theirs when running 
the blockade to get into the beleaguered Con- 
federacy under the folds of the Stars and Bars. 
A touching incident is related to show the affec- 
tion of Jefferson Davis for his children and 
their regard for him. Mrs. Wright's treatment 
of Davis is altogether fair, in spite of her 
father's violent dislike of the Confederate pres- 
ident's policies and plans. Another side of 
Johnston's character is revealed in the descrip- 
tions of life in his family. Very little is said 
about that most fruitful topic — ^the privations 
of the last years of the war; but under date of 
May 3, 1864, there is an amusing note to the 
effect that ' I am completely unshod, as my 
boot gave way entirely yesterday in my walk 
with F.,' and another note six days later ex- 
plains that Hhe prices for mending shoes are 
so exorbitant that I expect I had better wait 
and have them mended in the country.' How 
she managed meanwhile we are not informed. 

Some of the letters printed are valuable as 
historical documents. Wigfall was the confi- 
dential correspondent and adviser of Beaure- 
gard, and of Johnston, whose most cherished 
plans were unfolded for his approval and as- 
sistance. In this correspondence Wigfall is 
seen in a more favorable light than usual. Here 
he shows his common-sense, and that practical 
side of his nature which caused people of the 
time to respect his judgment, and none of that 
fierce and unreasoning criticism, that 'perni- 
cious nonsense,' as some one called it, which 
was characteristic of his conversation when ex- 
cited. The 'inside' history of his breach with 
Davis is here related, and the documents are 
given; and most people will agree that Wigfall 
and Johnston were right. Johnston's letters in 
regard to the conduct of Confederate affairs in 
the West are convincing as to the mistake made 
by Davis and liis advisers. Incidentally, John- 
ston's and Wigfall's disquisitions on the mili- 
tary aspects of the geographical situation of 
Mississippi and Tennessee are very effective. 
The friends of the excessively criticised General 
Braxton Bragg will be pleased at the frank 
praise of Bragg's management expressed in 
Johnston's private letters here published. There 
is a communication from Alexander H. Ste- 
phens, dated February 13, 1865, declaring that 
the Southern people are still willing and 
capable of resistance, but that leadership is 
lacking. Stephens favored an appeal to ' all 
friends of constitutional liberty ' at the North 



for a settlement in the ' forum of reason.' As 
long as he lived, Stephens believed that the war 
was fought over political and not over less 
superficial differences. The curious and inex- 
plicable hopefulness of the Southern people is 
shown in the correspondence of late 1864 and 
early 1865, in regard to the Atlanta and Ten- 
nessee campaigns. There is no indication that 
they knew how badly Hood was losing before 
Sherman and Thomas. There is a whole com- 
mentary in Wigfall's remark about Senator 
Hunter of Virginia : 'I don't know what we 
Southern men would do without Hunter ; he is 
the only one among us who knows anything 
about finance.' 

The volume is a fine specimen of the printer's 
art in type, paper, and illustrations. The lat- 
ter, about fifty in all, are from contemporary 
portraits of Confederate statesmen and gener- 
als, and Southern women of the war time. The 
last illustration, of the carpetbag and negro 
legislature of South Carolina, seems entirely 
out of place, unless it is meant to emphasize 
the contrast between ' before the war and after.'

American Colonial, Enterprise.* 

Eight years ago the American world, self- 
centered, self-complacent; and self-suificient, 
turned away indifferently from all that was 
occurring beyond our two enclosing seas. All 
our energies were absorbed in developing our 
own resources, and in working out our own 
industrial, financial, and political problems. 
Then came the sudden outburst of national 
wrath following the 'Maine' explosion, and 
at one bound we sprang from our historic iso- 
lation into the arena of world-politics. The 
crusading war to set free the oppressed Cuban 
led to the campaign in the following year 
which dashed the hopes of the oppressed Fili- 
pino. With one hand America offered to 
Cuba her place among the nations imder the 
international guarantee of this powerful gov- 
ernment, and with the other placed over the 
aspiring Philippines an alien proconsul and 
an alien law. In the midst of those Islanded 
seas, where for several centuries old-world 
powers have been working out the problems of 
the government of dependencies by a force 
imposed from without and from above, we 
have ourselves set up an experiment in the 
same dubious line. 

Two questions are propounded with grow-

ing insistency to the American people : ' How 
do you justify your continuance in the Phil- 
ippines ? ' and ' What is the character of your 
conduct there?' The second question can be 
answered only by presentation of facts; the 
first, however answered, must always lie within 
the field of opinion. Toward the discussion 
of this first question three bodies of opinion 
have been formed or promulgated in the 
United States within a few years. One group 
of thinkers, who have been in a general way 
designated as ' anti-imperialists,' believe that 
*in the nature of things, no political control 
can be legitimately exercised by any one set 
of men over another, and that such control, 
if permanently assumed, can never avoid the 
taint of selfishness.' A second group, at the 
other extreme of political ideas, will adopt the 
utterance of Professor Burgess, as an interpre- 
tation of their views : * We must conclude, 
from the manifest mission of the Teutonic 
nations, that interference in the affairs of 
populations not wholly barbaric, which have 
made some progress in state organization, but 
which manifest incapacity to solve the prob- 
lem of political civilization with any degree of 
completeness, is a justifiable policy. The 
Teutonic nations are the political nations of 
the modem era. . . . The duty has fallen 
to them of organizing the world politically.' 

Undoubtedly, the larger number of the many 
people in the United States for whom Pro- 
fessor Burgess may be allowed to speak, would 
accept, as a proper corollary from their views, 
that with the duty of organizing other peoples 
politically there goes the duty of so organizing 
them as to bring benefit and blessing to the 
dependent as well as to the ruling race. In 
their eyes, the organizing process well becomes 
a trust, exercised by the organized for the bene- 
fit of societ}' at large. Under the influence, 
however, of the events as they have marched 
in the islands since 1898, a new edition of 
imperialistic justification has taken form, and 
has differentiated a third group of thinkers, 
well represented by the author of 'The Ethics 
of Imperialism.' Mr. Carman has small re- 
spect for those who try to justify our stay in 
the Philippines on any altruistic basis of ' first 
help to the injured.' He will hear naught of 
Spanish aggression as a cause of our venture 
over sea, or of good done for anyone else by 
our continuance therein. He says boldly: 
'The truth is that the American nation felt 
the need, commercial!}', of the Philippines, 
precisely as Britain has long felt the need, 
commercially, of India ; and when the fortunes 
of war made it possible for her to seize the 
islands without the risk of embroiling any of 
the other stronger powers, she seized them. 



The Spanish war did not play the. part of a 
provocation, but it brought about an inter- 
national situation which made the seizure of 
the islands a safe proceeding.' This, in his 
ethical conception, was also a praiseworthy 
proceeding; and he adds a warning, that 'ii 
a people indulge so freely in pharisaical chat- 
ter about their " duty " toward weaker and 
more backward peoples that they come to be- 
Ueve that they are conquering them for the 
benefit of the conquered, they may be led into 
undertaking " duties " of this kind which will 
prove to be burdens.' Apparently in this lat- 
ter contingency only could matter for reproach 
be found. 

Mr. Carman arrives at an ethical satisfaction 
in these conclusions through a system of ethics 
which is his own. He sets up the 'ethics of 
egoism' over against so-called Christian ethics, 
which he identifies with a foolish and suicidal 
Altruism. He finds no progress, for the indi- 
vidual or for the community, except in an 
egoism which at best can only be called a rea- 
sonable selfishness. All that a man may do 
for wife or child or neighbor or country is 
done because it conduces to his own advance- 
ment, or at most, to his own pleasure. All the 
sources of action which have ever ennobled the 
world are, by this frank apostle of Self, pol- 
luted and poisoned. 'Whatever is is right' 
is more humanly if less humanely read anew, 
' whatever succeeds is right.' ' It seems hardly 
necessar}-,' he says, ' to point out that the more 
unselfish virtues — such as justice, honesty, 
truth, fair play, self-restraint from passions 
which might injure others as well as one's self 
— are as certainly egoistic. A man stands a 
better chance of getting and keeping wealth 
in a community which is honest than in one 
which is not; everybody benefits by justice, 
truth, fair play, and mutual self-restraint.' 
The conduct of a man who practises justice, 
truth, and fair play, in a community where the 
majority do otherwise, does not seem to be 
accounted for by this peculiar ethical system, 
although it might justify all the evils of suc- 
cessful imperialism. 

Mr. Willis, the author of 'Our Philippine 
Problem,' entitles himself 'sometime Armour- 
Crane travelling feUow in the University of 
Chicago,' although he does not indicate that 
he was such at the time of the investigations 
which are the basis for his book. This essay 
is a scathing impeachment of the conduct of 
the government of the United States and its 
employees in the Philippines. Mr. Willis some- 
what prejudices his case as an impartial critic 
by the expression of his own adverse opinion 
in the preliminary chapter, before he has pre- 
sented his evidence to his readers. He would 



272

have made the impression he desires to make 
more readily had he not thus violated a rule 
as good in book-making as in oratory. He has 
gone no further than page sixteen, when he 
makes the assertion — which he never takes up 
again : ' Experienced colonial administrators 
like Sir Andrew Clarke pointed the way to a 
pacific settlement of the difficulty through the 
establishment of a protectorate with native 
rulers advised by able and upright Americans; 
but such counsels were brushed aside. War 
was wanted: war enough, in the later words 
of President Roosevelt at Sea Girt, N. J., to 
go around.' 

Mr. Willis gives, apparently, careful studies 
of the civil service, local government, the ju- 
dicial system, the constabulary, the church, ed- 
ucation, business, agricultural and social con- 
ditions, and economic legislation. In no one 
of the fields does he speak encouragingly; in 
most of them he depicts a black picture. The 
chapter on control of public opinion, in its 
representation of a muzzled press and judic- 
iary, is only less hideous than the terrible 
survey of the system of supervised prostitution. 
As one turns these pages, he wonders whether 
he is reading about occurences in the daily 
life of a people in the twentieth century, or 
whether, unawares, he has picked up some 
treatise on the Venetian or Florentine life in 
the age of Machiavelli and the despots. No 
modem government has ever been more se- 
verely impeached of high crimes and misde- 
meanors against the spirit of the institutions 
of its people, than has the government at 
Washington in these chapters. The book can- 
not be ignored by those who love our institu- 
tions, nor indeed by those who administer them 
for us today. John J. Halsey.

two years, the sum, perhaps, of expectation 
for one who could write these exquisitely pa- 
thetic lines: 

' They are not long, the weeping and the laughter, 

Love and desire and hate, 
I think they have no portion in us after 

We pass the gate. 

' They are not long, the days of wine and roses : 

Out of a misty dream 
Our path emerges for a while, then closes

' He sang one tune over and over again,' says 
his critic-friend; and this is its most beautiful 
setting : 

' Last night, ah, yester night, betwixt her lips and mine 
There fell thy shadow, Cynara ! thy breath was shed 
Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine; 
And I was desolate and sick of an old passion ; 

Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head : 
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara ! in my fashion. 

' All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat. 
Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay ; 
Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet ; 
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion, 

When I awoke and found the dawn was gray : 
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara ! in my fashion.

Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind; 
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion, 

Yea, all the time, because the dance was long : 
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara ! in my fashion. 

' I cried for madder music and for stronger wine, 
But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire, 
Then falls thy shadow, Cynara ! the night is thine ; 
And I am desolate and sick of an old passion. 

Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire : 
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara ! in my fashion.' 

The tradition of polished academic verse, 
sensitive to the pressure of the time, but in- 
formed by ideals that are more than temporal, 
the traditions best illustrated during our own 
age by Matthew Arnold, is well maintained 
by Mr. Arthur C. Benson, a singer who is 
never clamorous, but whose restrained mea- 
sures are far more impressive to the reflective 
mind than those of the more robust voices 
that catch the general ear. One does not 
often (outside of the accepted classics) come 
upon as beautiful a poem as the 'Peace' 
which opens Mr. Benson's latest volume. We 
quote three of the most typical stanzas: 

' I am not weary of the kindly earth. 

Nay, I am fain of honour and delight ; 
I bless the patient hour that gave me birth, 

I shudder at the neaier-creeping night; 
But I have dreams of something deeper yet, 

A steadfast joy that daily should increase. 
Warm glowing 'neath the ashes of regret ; 

Not dull content that comes when ardours cease, 
But peace divinely bright, unconquerable peace.

' Not here nor there is peace to be achieved. 

The mind must change, and not the earthly scene ; 
And how shall he who once hath truly grieved 

Gain hope and strength to be secure, serene? 
Not by forgetting shall such rest be earned. 

Nor with closed eyes that dare not see the light. 
But facing loss and death, and having learned 

What hope remains, what heritage of might — 
Then on the fearful heart dawns the unhoped-for light. 

' And not in youth .can this be inly seen. 

Not till the years have dimmed the dinted shield ; 
Not till the stern thought of what might have been. 

Hath pierced the spirit, and the wound is healed. 
Youth dreams of love and conquest, generous dreams. 

Nought is too high but he shall dare to climb ; 
Then, when in mid ascent the summit seems 

More steep than Heaven itself, more old than Time, 
Then dawns the light, and makes the broken life sublime.' 

Mr. Benson's ' Ode to Japan/ written in cele- 
bration of tiie English alliance, may be illus- 
trated by the following stanzas: 

' From us you shall acquire 

Stern labour, sterner truth. 
The generous hopes that fire 
The Spirit of our youth. 
And that strong faith we reckon ours. 
Yet have not learned its strength, nor proved Its dearest 
powers. 
' And we from you will learn 

To gild our days with grace. 
Calm as the lamps that burn 
In some still holy place ; 
The lesson of delight to spell. 
To live content with little, to serve beauty well.' 

Tender, sincere, and refined, Mr. Benson's 
verse appeals to our highest spiritual nature, 
and delivers its message with persuasive grace. 
We wish that we might reproduce ' The Fool/ 
in still further exhibition of the author's 
quality, and find space to illustrate both his 
sonnets and his official odes to music, and 
upon the death of Victoria and the coronation 
of Edward. 

Mr, Francis Coutts dedicates his new vol- 
ume to * ^lusa Verticordia,' whereby he would 
signify a consecration to sterner thoughts and 
loftier ideals than concern the common cry 
of rhymers. ' Enlarge your measures, min- 
strels ' is his war-cry, and his purpose, 

' To make each reasonable spirit free 
To work out its salvation, undeterred 
By old accumulated custom's dross 
Or by authority's self-loving law.' 

It is a severe task, and the temptation to seek 
more flowery patlis is strong. 

' Ah, sometimes still unwittingly I sigh 

To sing the facile lie. 
The old familiar fancies, — women, wine. 

Pale moonlight and moonshine. 
Faint ecstacies of pure religious faith, 

The legend and the wraith. 
With birds and butterflies, and dreams of gold. 

The new dream and the old.' 

In the pursuance of his high purpose, Mr. 
Coutts acliieves strength, although often at 
the sacrifice of the gracious charm which we 
are wont to demand of a poet. We may il- 
lustrate tliis statement by his sonnet-commen- 
tary upon a text found in the ' Osservatore 
Eomano ' at the time of the Dreyfus trial. 



' Oblivious of infinity, — interred 

As in a chrysalis of scanty scope. 

In this small world, where he must grovel and grope, — 
Is Man more tragical or more absurd? 
Consider that abominable word 

Just uttered by the Journal of the Pope : 

" A Jew accused of treason must not hope 
For sympathy from us." Have they not heard 

That story of the Jew of Galilee, 

Who suffered crucifixion for the blame 
Of treason and the sin of heresy? 

And lit they not the faggot's frequent flame. 
To prove their perfect Catholicity 

By burning those outside it, in his name?' 

This attitude of intellectual challenge is char- 
acteristic of the entire volume, and it is such 
touches of sceva indignatio that give the 
author's work its most distinctive quality. 

Mrs. Hubert Bland (E. Xesbit) is no ama- 
teur of verse, and her work always pleases. 
It reaches about the level of Jean Ingelow's 
thought and sentiment, but never quite 
achieves the distinction of Christina Eossetti. 
Her latest volume, ' The Rainbow and the 
Rose,' yields us these pretty stanzas, entitled 
' En Tout Cas ' : 

* When I am glad I need your eyes 

To be the stars of Paradise ; 

Your lips to be the seal of all 

The joy life grants, and dreams recall ; 

Your hand, to lie my hands between 

What time we walk the garden green. 

'But most in grief I need your face 

To lean to mine in the desert place ; 

Your lips to mock the evil years. 

To sweeten me my cup of tears. 

Your eyes to shine, in cloud's despite, 

Your hands to bold mine through the night.' 

Father Sheehan stands sponsor for Miss 
Lizzie Twigg's little book of ' Songs and 
ing in the old Celtic way of aU the tender- 
ness and sweetness, the magic and glamours 
of Xature, as she shows herself here in our 
own beautiful land.' We must surely welcome 
a singer who brings us such Ivrical verse as 
'Hush!' 

' Flame in the skies of sunset brighter than dazzle of dawn. 
Silver veil of the daisies spread on an emerald lawn, 
Deep'ning grey of the twilight falling on byre and bawn. 
And mists like a ghostly garment round the quiet moun- 
tains drawn. 

' Here through the dusky branches gleametb the rosy flush. 
Onward the river runneth, lapping through reed and rush. 
Out in the stillness ringeth the song of a hidden thrush. 
With finger on lip stands silence, and hush '. says th« 
whole world, hush ! ' 

Another lyric, equally simple and equally 
charming, is called ' Sunset.' 

' Opal and pink and pearl and gold 

There in the West away. 
Silver and crimson fold on fold 

There in the West away. 
And the radiant sea like a mirror rolled 

There in the West away. 

■ Who does not sigh for the lands that lie 

Hid in the West away? 
Hid by the curtain of sunset sky 

Far in the West away? 
Who does not sigh for wings to fly 

Away to the West, away?'

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



It takes a well-nigh perfect ear for music to 
write such verse as this. And how these Irish 
poets love to ring the changes on light and 
shadow, color and sound, birds and flowers 
and trees! Father Sheehan aptly says of this 
book that it offers ' the antithesis of every 
art that may be called Tennysonian/ and we 
may well be glad that it is so spontaneous 
and unaffected, so free from bookishness and 
imitative endeavor. 

Mr. John Vance Cheney has been known 
to the public for many years as one of our 
most delicate lyrists. Nearly every magazine 
of consequence has had him for a contrib- 
utor, and he has put forth several small col- 
lections of his verse. He has now brought 
together in a single volume of ' Poems ' all of 
his work that he wishes to preserve, and 
thereby made it possible to form a just es- 
timate of his total achievement. It is a lim- 
ited achievement, no doubt, for few of the 
pieces extend beyond a single page, and many 
of them are but the briefest bits of song. 
The only exception to this general rule is 
offered by the dramatic idyl at the close of 
the book, MVhen Love Was Lord,' which 
serves chiefly to emphasize the fact that the 
poet is most truly himself when he is con- 
tent to be a maker of cameos. Nor is there 
a very deep note of passion sounded in his 
song. His lyrics are of acceptance, coupled 
only with the gentlest and most apologetic 
sort of questioning. When nature is his 
theme, there is rarely any questioning at 
all, but merely the penetrative gaze and the 
loving communion. The very soul of 'Twi- 
light,' for example, the very heart of its mys- 
tery, is in these lines: 

' Hid ways have winds that lightly shake 
The silver willows, half-awake, 
Mysterious paths the moonbeams take 
Across the shadowed mountain-lake ; 
The soul in deeper secret goes 
Behind the lilac and the rose 
In skies of evening, far away. 
Beyond the flight of night and day.' 

Mr. Cheney is often felicitous in the simple 
quatrain of gnomic content: 

' Wouldst hear the singing of the spheres. 
Hark with closed ears ; 
Wouldst follow Beauty to her skies. 
Look with closed eyes.' 

His philosophy of life — ^not the deepest, 
perhaps, but true as far as it goes, — is ex- 
pressed in ' The Happiest Heart.' 

' Who drives the horses of the sun 

Shall lord it but a day ; 
Better the lowly deed were done, 

And kept the humble way. 

' The rust will find the sword of fame, 
s. The dust will hide the crown ; 
Ay, none shall nail so high his name 
Time will not tear it down. 



' The happiest heart that ever beat 

Was in some quiet breast 
That found the common daylight sweet, 

And left to Heaven the rest.' 

Sometimes a pleasant conceit is expressed with 
engaging naivete, as in the verses 'At Candle- 
Lighting.' 

' I think it better to believe. 

And become as the children, they 

The children of the early day. 
Who let the kindly dream deceive. 
And joyed in all the mind may weave 

Of dear conceit — better, I say. 

To let wild fancy have her way, 
To trust her than to know and grieve. 
A poet of old Colophon 

A notion held I think was right, 

No matter how or where he gat it ; 
The stars are snuffed out every daicn, 

And newly lighted every night. 
I hope to catch the angels at it. 

The traits that we have found space to illus- 
trate, and others that must go unmentioned, 
should endear the author to us, at least m our 
less strenuous moods. They are traits that 
constantly suggest the artless method and the 
appealing voice of Emerson, to whose memory 
it was peculiarlv fitting that the author should 
have inscribed "this beautiful and sympathetic 
sonnet : 

' Plato come back to turn a Yankee phrase, 
Franklin recalled to lord the world of soul — 
So came he, so he journeyed, sane and whole, 

The Concord pilgrim on the upper ways. 

Born to her lap, his heart was ever May's, 
In vernal terms he read to us the scroll 
Of time ; he chanted from the magic roll ; 

We knew the joy and beauty of the days. 

He read to us until his sight grew dim — 

Blinded with brightness from beyond the sun — 
Then followed he the glory from afar. 

But not until a race had learned of him 

The murmurs of eternity that run ^ 

Through human hearts, the blossom and the star. 

According to the title-page of his 'Poems,' 
Mr. Alexander Francis Chamberlain is a doc- 
tor of philosophy, a professor of anthropology, 
and a member of various learned societies. 
But these ominous facts should not be counted 
heavily against him. since his verse is of pleas- 
ing qualitv, and inspired by fine ideals. We 
qu'ote what seems to us the best of his son- 
nets. 

' Two men, at least, earth holds, not less than heaven. 

Immortal, — Jesus, Shakespeare. Saxon, Jew, 
Alike these conquer race and clime, are given 

Enduring mastery over old and new. 
One chose in all men's hearts to be eu.shrined. 

So death might pass, and hate be lost in love. 
The other, templed in the human mind. 

Drew life and death, all acts and thoughts that move. 
They stand alone, but not from us disjoined, 

Or from each other. They are kith and kin 
Of all mankind. The wit, the love they coined 

Came from the common ore where all begin. 
That English brain, that heart in Palestine, 
Grew not less human, as they grew divine.' 

A sonnet seems to be the best selection we 
can make from the sonnets, lyrics, and quat- 
rains that make up Mr. Frederic Fairchild 
Sherman's ' Dav Dream and Even Song.'

THE DTATi

• Sweeter than any earthly dawn is this. 

The morning of our love, when her fond eyes 
Open like little flowers of Paradise 

And fill the garden place of dreams with bliss. 

No glory of the daybreak do I miss — 

Blushes that rival daybreak's rosy skies, — 
Smiles that are sunshine laughing in disguise, — 

And all the sweets of summer in her kiss. 

Her hair is like a golden mist above 
The snowy bosom, that unfathomed sea. 

The undercurrent and the tide whereof 

Are but the yearning of her heart for m«; 

And in the lyric whisper of her love 
There is a murmur of eternity.' 

This is extremely pretty in the conventional 
way, and there are a dozen others as good, 
to say nothing of the lyrics or of the really 
fine ode at the close of the volume. 

The poetic-al work of Miss Amanda T. 
Jones has been for many years familiar to 
those who have explored the byways of Amer- 
ican literary production, and they have al- 
ways felt that it deserved a wider recognition 
than has thus far been accorded to it. Now, 
after a long silence. Miss Jones has put forth 
a new volume of poems, which may perhaps 
secure for her work something of the appre- 
ciation which has long been its due. The 
new book is entitled 'Rubaiyat of Solomon, 
and Other Poems.' The first third of its con- 
Poems,' and speaks of the author as ' dream- 
tents is given up to a versification, in the 
familiar rubaiyat form, of certain of the say- 
ings of Solomon and Koheleth. The follow- 
ing is a typical example: 

' Better is grief than feasting : Go thy way 
Unto the house of mourning, — there survey 

The end of all mankind : for it is well 
The living to his heart this truth should lay. 

' Sorrow cxcelleth laughter : None may tell 
What hour he also with the dead must dwell. 

By sadness of the countenance, the heart 
Is turned to God that did from Him rebel. 

' The wise man chooseth still the better part. 
But if, within the house of mirth, thou art 

Among the fools better than song shall be 
The wise rebuke that woundeth as a dart. 

' As crackling thorns, under the pot, set free 
Their sparks that straightway into darkness flee. 

Even so the laughter of the fool doth start; 
And all his works with vanity agree." 

There are some fifty pages of this sort of 
paraphrase, but we cannot help regarding the 
effort as a mistaken one. The consecrated 
words do not gain in either dignity or beauty; 
in fact, they lose very distinctly, and all such 
attempts must be essentially of the lineage of 
Sternhold and Hopkips, or of the Bay Psalm 
Book. It is elsewhere in Miss Jones's volume 
that we must look for her most meritorious 
verse. We find it, for example, in the group 
of ' Kansas Bird Songs,' in the lyrics of 
childhood, the tender personal tributes, and 
the pieces that touch on contemporary his- 
tory. We cannot do better than quote from 



the poem called ' Panama ' (home of the 
dove-plant, or Holy Ghost flower). 

' What time the Lord drew back the sea 

And gave thee room, slight Panama, 
" I will not have thee great," said He, 
But thou Shalt bear the slender key 
Of both the gates I builded Me 
And all the great shall come to thee 

5'or leave to pass, O, Panama ! 

iFlower of the Holy Ghost, white dove. 
Breathe sweetness where He wrought in love 11 

' His oceans call across the land ! 

" How long, how long, fair Panama, 
Wilt thou the shock of tides withstand. 
Nor heed us, sobbing by the strand? 
Set wide thy gates on either hand. 
That we may search through saltless sand. 

May clasp and kiss, O, Panama? 

[Flower of the deep-embosomed dove, 
So should His mighty nations love li 

Commenting about six years ago upon Miss 
Helen Hay's first volume of verse, we spoke 
of its evidence of * poetic sensibility and the 
artistic conscience.' The author (now Mrs. 
Whitney) has produced a second volume which 
justifies a repetition, and even an emphasis, 
of this characterization. Here are thirty son- 
nets and rather more than that number of 
songs, every one of which is a finished bit 
of art. The work is of so even an excellence 
that it offers little room for choice. The 
first of the sonnets — ' Ave atque Vale ' — is 
as good as any of those that come after, and 
how good it is we will make clear by quota- 
tion. 

' As a blown leaf across the face of Time 
Your name falls emptily upon my heart. 
In this new symmetry you have no part. 

No lot in my fair life. The stars still chime 

Autumn and Spring in ceaseless pantomine. 
I play with Beauty, which is kin to Art, 
Forgetting Nature. Nor do pulses start 

To hear your soul remembered in a rhyme. 

You may not vex me any more. The stark 
Terror of life has passed, and all the stress. 
Winds had their will of me, and now caress. 
Blown from bland groves I know. Time dreams, 

and I, 
As on a mirror, see the days go by 
In nonchalant procession to the dark.' 

The note of grave melancholy thus struck at 
the outset is maintained in all the pages that 
follow, for the 'deep, unuttered sadness in 
the world' is the constant burden of Mrs. 
Whitney's song. Even the lyrics are rarely 
lyrics of joy, and when they seem to be such, 
it is a subdued joy, chastened by some reflec- 
tion upon the transitoriness of human happi- 
ness. Yet the sadness of the poet does not 
bring forth blind despair; it rather spurs the 
spirit on to nobler endeavor, 

' Fight, though the bulwarks of your faith may fall. 
Life become gray and full of weariness, 
Love prove a lie and wisdom bitterness — 

Fight, for the strife alone avails for all. 

' Fight and fight on, exalting in the light. 
Standing alert and upright gleefully^ 
Seizing life's joys and woes courageously, 

Man to the end, and Master — laugh and fight.'

This is the fine challenge to the spirit that

from the lips of Arnold and Henley and Sill. 
We must make one more selection, this time 
for the purpose of illustrating the imagina- 
tive quality of the writer. ' Etoiles d'Enfer '

' The four wide •winds of evening have their stars, 

Fashioned In Are, in purity of snow. 
Tossed to their height by endless avatars — 

These all the righteous know. 

' What of the stars of Hades? On the gloom 
The outcast see them shine like angels' eyes. 

And in the living night that Is their tomb

Fair blossoms spring from villainy of weeds. 
Rest — and redeem the past.'

Posthumous The gleaning of the grapes of 

eketches by Laf cadio Hearn suffers but little 

Littfcadio Hearn. gygn when compared with his own 
Vintage at its best. A small pasthumous volume 
feUtitled 'The Romance of the Milky Way, and 
Other Studies and Stories' (Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co.) presents half a dozen (or seven, to be exact) 
graceful trifles, all but two Japanese in theme, 
preceded by a short biographical and appreciative 
iwotice by 'F. G.,'— that is, beyond the perad- 
"^'ei^ture of a doubt, Mr. Ferris Greenslet. 'With 
the 'exception of a body of familiar letters now 
itt process of collection,' says this editor, 'the 
present volume contains all of Heai'u's writing 
that he left uncollected in the magazines or in 
manuscript of a sufficient ripeness for publica- 
tion.' The exquisite art of Hearn 's pen stamps 
<tiie little book as a notable one; and, curiously 
"enough, the chapter on 'Ultimate Questions,' sug- 
gested by Spencer's essay thus entitled, and left 
by the author in what he regarded as an unfin- 
ished condition, is the best and most character- 
istic portion of the collection. In this paper, 
as Mr. Greenslet Avrites, 'which sti*ikes, so to say, 
the dominant chord of this volume, we have an 
almost lyrical expression of the meaning for him 
of the Spencerian philosophy and psychology. In 
it is his characteristic mingling of Buddhist and 
Shinto thought with English and French psy- 
t'hology, strains which in his work "do not sim- 
ply mix well," as he says in one of his letters, 
but "absolutely unite, like chemical elements,— 
rush together with a shock;"— and in it he 
strikes his deepest note. In his steady envisage- 
ment of the horror that envelopes the stupendous 
universe of science, in his power to evoke and 
revive old myths and supei'stitions, and by their 
glamour to cast a ghostly light of vanished suns 
over the darkness of the abyss, he Avas the most 
Lucretian of modern writers. ' The first two chap- 
ters deal with matters of Japanese folk-lore and 
poetry, many of the peculiar five-line poems being 



given, Avith prose translations and numerous ex- 
planatory footnotes. The closing selection is a 
highly interesting 'Letter from Japan,' dated 
August I, 1904, and treating of the Avar then 
in progress, and of the calm, confident, even joy- 
ful bearing of the people at home. A short ac- 
count of a gruesome AVest Indian incident, and 
two Japanese stories of the Aveird and ghostly 
order, make up the rest of the book. In the 
light of recent events, Avhich tend to prove that 
Japan can more calmly face OA^erAvhelming disas- 
ters than minor annoyances, the following is of 
interest: 'Were Kuropatkin able to fulfil his 
rash threat of invading Japan,' says Hearn, 'the 
nation Avould probably rise as one man. But 
otherwise the knowledge of any great disaster 
Avonld be bravely borne. From time unknoAvn, 
Japan has been a land of cataclysms,— earth- 
quakes that ruin cities in the space of a moment; 
tidal Avaves, tAvo hundred miles long, sweeping 
Avhole coast populations out of existence; floods 
submerging hundreds of leagues of Avell-tilled 
fields; eruptions burying provinces. Calamities 
like this haA'e disciplined the race in resignation 
and in patience; and it has been Avell trained also 
to bear Avith courage all the misfortunes of war. 
Even by the foreign peoples that have been most 
closely in contact with her, the eai^acities of 
Japan remain unguessed. Perhaps her poAver to 
resist aggression is far surpassed by her power to 
endure.' 

The Far East Mr. Archibald Little's 'The Far 
geographically East' (Oxford Clarendon Press) 
considered. ig the kind of book of which 

there has been genuine need for some time. It 
furnishes, instead of the familiar speculations 
about oriental competition or the possibilities of 
Avestern struggle for the partition of China, a 
geographical study of the various political divi- 
sions of the extreme Orient. There is small treat- 
ment of actual commerce, or of immediate com- 
mercial prospects in the narroAv sense, anywhere 
in the volume. In a A'ery important Avay, how- 
eA-er, the book will furnish aid to the student of 
commerce, since it estimates the fundamental re- 
sources, and, quite as important, the distribution 
of the water-AA'ays and possible trade-ioutes of 
the Chinese Empire and its dependencies and 
neighbors. Here and there, brief historical sum- 
maries supply a background for the discussion of 
the px'obable political and commercial relations of 
the future. There is much that must be of A'alue 
to students of possible militarv campaigns, and 
more that Avill serA'e to inform the intelligent 
business man Avho is studying the possibilities of 
scientific trade expansion. While Mr. Little's 
Avork is thus primarily geographical and geolog- 
ical, its political features being purely incidental, 
it is not written in a style that ought to repel 
any serious reader, even though he may not be 
a student of science in the narroAv sense of that 
tei-m. The A'olume is certainly not popular, yet 
it has a quality of interest that AA'ill commend 
it for very general reading. The preface de- 
scribes it as having been 'Avritten literally in the 
intervals of business'; but this business being 
that of a commercial traveller in the Far East,

the absorption of the author seems to have helped 
rather than hindered the attainment of success- 
ful results. A feature of the book worthy of 
special praise is the numerous maps, which show 
both geographical and physiographical relations. 
They have e\idently been selected with great 
care, particularly those which indicate the dis- 
tribution of mineral products. A few photo- 
graphs, none of which seems familiar and all of 
which are enlightening, appear in the book. Mr. 
Little's work is one that should be especially ac- 
ceptable in view of the general interest, and 
equally general lack of accurate information, with 
reference to the Far East which just now pre- 
vails in the United States. 



A aciioiariy The better acquaintance that the 

essayist's reader gains with Mr. Paul Elmer 

latest Kork. More, as the successive volumes 

of 'Shelburne Essays' (Putnam) make their ap- 
pearance, is not the least part of the pleasure 
they bestow. In the Third Series, just issued, 
an emphasis that speaks of personal experience 
and conviction is more than once placed on the 
unreality of things commonly held to be real, 
and on the permanence and substantiality of the 
ideal. * Only, perhaps ' the author declares, ' when 
the hope of love . . . and the visions of 
ambition, the belief in pleasure and the luxury 
of grief, have lost their sting, do we turn to 
books with the contented understajiding that the 
shadow is the reality, and the seeming reality 
of things is the shadow.' There is a ring, too, 
of personal reminiscence in what is said of the 
significance to literary art of disappointed love 
in the literary artist. Denied the happiness of 
living his love-stoiy, the poet is forced to i-ealize 
it in his verse. These later essays, especially 
that on Sterne, betray a fine appreciation of 
humor which the earlier pieces had hardly led 
one to expect. But from indulgence in humor 
on his own part, the essayist, with a not impraise- 
worthy restraint, still refrains, except rarely and 
in a very quiet way. Chapters on Whittier, 
Browning, and Swinburne show Mr. More to be 
a warm lover of the Quaker poet, a less ardent 
admirer of Browning, whom he regards as a ' false 
prophet,' and not at all enthusiastic over Swin- 
burne. Whittier 's 'Pennsylvania Pilgrim' strikes 
him as possessing peculiar beauty, and as 'quite 
the most characteristic of his works.' Yet he 
fails to find in the poet's critics and biographers 
any confirmation of this judgment, and is only 
reassured by some words of praise from Whit- 
tier's own pen— hardly the most authoritative 
source. The reason of this 'conspiracy of silence,' 
as the essa^-ist calls it, is not so unapparent as 
he seems to think. The three-line stanza, each 
line ending in the same rhyme, is awkward, and 
is largely responsible for many forced and faulty 
rhj-mes. The rhythm, too, is in places anything 
but musical. Finally, the poem, one of Whittier 's 
longest, is too long; that is, it suffers in com- 
parison with the poet's gems of song, which, ex- 
cept 'Snowbound,' are all much shorter. Mr. 
More shows himself to be still unreconciled to 
Xew England transcendentalism. To him, the 



iron string so magnificently twanged by Emerson 
gives forth a false note. This 'spirit of self- 
dependence,' he asserts, 'was dangerous at the 
best.' Besides the above-indicated subjects, the 
book treats of Cowper, Sainte-Beuve, Scott's 
novels, Christina Rossetti, 'Don Juan,' Short- 
house, and 'The Quest of a Century.' The quest 
is for peace, and the author's closing paragraph, 
too long for quotation here, is especially com- 
mended to the reader's attention. 



A new life The mediaeval biography is one of 

of Ireland's the most Untrustworthy forms of 

patron saint. historic literature. Particularly is 
this true when the subject is one of the earlier 
saints. Frequently the personal histories of these 
men are so completely overlaid with legend that 
it is almost impossible to obtain even a glimpse 
of the individual as he really was. Perhaps this 
is truer of Saint Patrick than of any of the other 
great Christian heroes of the middle ages. Pro- 
fessor Bury, of Cambridge, England, has recently 
undertaken to separate the mythical from the 
actual, and reveal to us the real Patrick. His 
'life of St. Patrick' (Macmillan) is a book of 
about four hundred pages, nearly half of which 
are devoted to a critical examination of the 
sources. According to this learned historian, Pat- 
rick was bom about the year 389, somewhere in 
southwestern Britain, perhaps in Wales. At the 
age of sixteen, he was carried as a captive into 
northern Connaught (not into Ulster, as some 
have maintained) ; but a few years later he es- 
caped to Graul, whence he was taken to Italy. 
After a time he found his way back to Britain; 
but soon the conviction came to him that he was 
chosen to preach the Gospel in the land of his 
captivity, and he returned to Gaul to prepare 
himself for the Christian ministry. In 432 he 
was consecrated bishop, and proceeded to his 
chosen field. He was then probably forty-three 
years old. For nearly twenty years he worked 
among the Irish, his death occurring on the sev- 
enteenth of March, 461. Most of his work was 
done in the northern part of the island, but he 
was active also in other parts. Patrick was not 
the first to plant the standards of the Church in 
Ireland, nor was he the first bishop of the Irish 
Church, Palladius having served a year before 
him; but the real growth of Christianity in those 
regions dates from his arrival, and the organiza- 
tion of the Church in Ireland was largely Ms 
work. The popular conception of Patrick's char- 
acter, the present biographer finds to be utterly 
false; with the hero-saint of Celtic legend 'who 
curses men and even inanimate things which incur 
his displeasure,' he has nothing in comjnon but a 
name. His writings reveal a strong personality, 
an intensely spiritual nature, a resolute char- 
acter, an imbending will, and an energetic man- 
hood. In learning he was very deficient, but 
he possessed in great measure those 'practical 
qualities most essential for carrying through the 
task which he undertook in the belief that he 
had been divinely inspired to fulfil it.' Perhaps 
some readers will regret that Professor Bury has 
found it necessary to reject so much picturesque

material, but students of the middle ages are 
likely to agree that in writing this biography the 
author has done a real service to the cause of 
Irish history. 

A group 'The Fern Allies' is the title of a 
of humble handsome book recently published 
floral friends. by the Stokes Company, New 
York, for Mr. Willard N. Clute, the author. Mr. 
Clute is Instructor in Botany in the Joliet town- 
ship high-school, and has been long known as an 
enthusiastic student of Ferns, The fern allies 
include a variety of small and generally unno- 
ticed plants whose principal interest lies in the 
fact that they are kin to the ferns, and in the 
further fact that they are in a general way the 
meagre remnants of an earlier wide-spread majes- 
tic flora, namely, that of the age of coal. The 
little club-mosses that run among the trees and 
carpet the ground in some of our undisturbed 
northern woods, pretty green plants sending aloft 
yellowish spikes dusty with golden spores in their 
season, are probably the most familiar of the 
series, siuae in these later sentimental days they 
are gathered from the woods and heaths in thou- 
sands, packed in barrels and sent to every hamlet 
and town, in an effort to make Christmas green. 
Hardly less familiar, however, are the old scour- 
ing-rushes of meadow and farm, — the 'joint- 
grasses' of childhood memory: strange, clean 
stems that could be plucked apart and reunited 
as one walked to school, much as were the youth- 
ful loves and friendships of those days. These 
queer old plants, less than a hundred species of 
them in all (and that means in all North Amer- 
ica), Mr. Clute has gathered for us, drawn every 
one, and presented by a very complete descrip- 
tion in each case, so that, as he says, even the 
novice should now be able to name and know 
the little specimens as they are collected or 
encountered. Eight colored plates, some of them 
more than usually life-like, contribute to the 
book's attractiveness. The style of the author 
is generally adapted to the purpose in view, 
but is sometimes diffuse and sometimes not clear, 
'Insolation,' on page 145, will not be understood. 
The book is a valuable addition to our literature 
of less-known American plants, and will no 
doubt contribute to the wider information of 
our people in a direction in which as intelligent 
men and women we have yet much to learn, much 
to enjoy. 

Saint Catherine of Siena has long 
saintly woman. ^een recognized as the most re- 
markable woman of the four- 
teenth century. The new translation of her 
Letters (Dent-Dutton), made and edited with 
able introductions by Miss Vida D, Seudder, re- 
veals her also as one of the most significant 
authors of her time. This is not because of her 
literary style (a matter that probably never en- 
tered into the mind of this woman who only 
learned to write with her own hand three years 
before her death), but because, being a woman of 
■personal charm and wide sympathies, she gath- 
ered around her friends and disciples from 
every social group in Italy, as well as people 



from many other lands; so that, turning these 
pages, the whole society of the fourteenth century 
passes in review. This dyer's daughter of 
Siena had that rarest of all gifts, the power to 
enter thoroughly into the consciousness of other 
people. Her 'love for souls' was no cold illum- 
ination, but a warm understanding of and ten- 
derness for actual men and women. Accordingly, 
in these letters we find her writing to prisoners 
and outcasts; to great nobles and plain business 
men; to physicians, laAvyers, soldiers of fortune; 
to kings and queens and cardinals and popes; to 
recluses pursuing the Beatific Vision, and to men 
and women of the world plunged in the lusts of 
the flesh and governed by the pride of life. 
This great adaptability, joined to the most out- 
spoken fearlessness, gives to her letters a vitality 
that still tingles through them after the lapse of 
centuries. In one sense, her life might be counted a 
failure, since all her tears and efforts failed to 
accomplish that reform and purification of the 
Church for which she prayed and labored unceas- 
ingly. Those whom she loved best disappointed 
her ideal. She witnessed iniquity in high religious 
places, violence and corruption enlisted in the 
defense of truth. Outwardly, all around her was 
confusion; but her own life was rounded into a 
harmonious whole. To read the expression of 
that life in her letters is to follow one of those 
tragedies that are yet the salvation of the world. 



An early It was to be presumed that the 

American bulk of the historical material 

Indian u-ar. collected in Madison, Wisconsin, 

by Mr, L. C, Draper during the thirty odd years 
of his administration as Secretary of the Wis- 
consin Historical Society, had heretofore appeared 
in print. Scarcely a book or article has been 
written on trans-Alleghenian history during sev- 
eral decades past which has not drawn largely 
from this storehouse. Yet the present Secretary 
of the Society, in the preface to a 'Documentary 
History of Lord Dunmore's War,' says that this 
is the first considerable publication from that 
collection of manuscripts, and that it exhibits the 
character and scope of the remarkable store of 
material yet unpublished. The volume of nearly 
500 pages is issued by the Wisconsin Historical 
Society, from funds supplied by the Sons of the 
American Revolution of that State, It includes 
public records, private letters, muster-rolls, jour- 
nals, and official reports, covering the year 1774, 
and forming a source history of the campaign 
waged by Lord Dunmore of Virginia on the 
Shawnese and other Indians of the upper Ohio, 
of which the battle of Point Pleasant was the 
culminating feature. The documents are printed 
in their original forms, and the annotating is full 
and luminous. The work is a significant addition 
to the best products of American scholarship. 

A handbook of Warm praise must be accorded to 
arts and crafts Mr. Stewart Dick's 'Arts and 
of Old Japan. Qyafts of Old Japan' (McClurg). 
It is by far the best short introduction to 
the subject of which it treats that has yet 
appeared. Within the compass of a hundred and

fifty-three pages, the author tells just the things 
the beginner needs to know and cannot readily 
get at elsewhere without considerable research. 
These are set forth clearly and intelligently. 
Furthermore, the reader is spwred the sentimental 
nonsense too often indulged in bj' writers on this 
topic. Though the book is not the product of 
much original investigation, it is free from seri- 
ous eri-or, and it is apparent that the author's 
appreciation of the works of art produced in 
Japan is well-informed and discriminating. The 
principal collections owned in England, he seems 
to have studied with care. Those in France, 
Germany, and America, though of greater im- 
pox'tance. are not mentioned; presumably he is 
not familiar with them. To this, and to having 
followed too closely the writings of Strange and 
others, some regi-ettable omissions and defects in 
proportion may be attributed. For instance, in 
the chapter on color printing, To3'okuni is given 
more than a page, whereas Kiyonaga, a much 
greater ai'tist. though comparatively unknown in 
England, is accorded but eight lines of faint 
praise. Exception may be taken also to various 
statements here and there, such as that most of 
Harunobu's prints contain but a single figure. 
But shortcomings of this kind are few. The half- 
tone illustrations, which are from objects in 
English collections, serve their purpose suffici- 
ently, though it can hardly be said that thej' con- 
vey an adequate idea of the charm of the works 
reproduced. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



'Civics: Studies in American Citizenship', by 
Mr. Waldo H. Shemian, is a new text book, highly 
practical in its bearings, published by the Macmii- 
ian Co. Its principal feature is a scheme for prac- 
tical training in polities and civic duties by means 
of a student organization called CoUegeville. 

Professor William T Brewster has performed a 
useful service for teachers of literature by collect- 
ing into a single volume, with notes, a number of 
•Representative Essays on the Theory of Style.' 
The work gives us essays by Newman, De Quincey, 
Spencer, Lewes. Stevenson, Pater, and Mr. Frederic 
Harrison. It is published by the Macmillan Co. 

' Sri Brahma Dhara, ' which means ' shower from 
the highest, ' is a little book published by Messrs. 
Luzac k Co., London. It is the work of Mahatma 
Sri Agamya Guru Paramahamsa, known in India as 
the 'Tiger Mahatma,' and called by Max Miiller 

* the only Indian saint he had ever known. ' This 
gifted exponent of the A^edanta philosophy visited 
England and America some two years ago, and at- 
tracted much attention. 

In connection with an English house, Messrs. 
McClurg & Co. have begun the publication of a 

* Library of Standard Biography, ' which starts off 
auspiciously with four volumes containing Lock- 
hart's Burns and Scott, Carlyle's Cromwell, and 
Miss Strickland 's Queen Elizabeth. Xew notes 
and an index have been added in each case, and 
in three of the four volumes the original text has 
been abridged to meet the requirements of the 
present-day hurried reader. The books are neatly 
printed, attractively bound, and surprisingly low 
in price. 



XOTES. 



'King Lear' wiU be added immediately by Messrs. 
Crowell to their valuable little 'First FoUo' edition 
of Shakespeare's works. 

Mr. Arthur Symons, poet and essayist, will pub- 
lish shortly a new volume entitled 'Spiritual Ad- 
ventures,' being a series of studies in temperament. 

The series of dictionaries published by Messrs. 
Laird & Lee has had conferred upon it the distinc- 
tion of a gold medal award from the Lewis and 
Clark Centennial Exposition. 

A single-volume reprint of the 'Letters and Ad- 
dresses of Thomas Jefferson' will form an early 
addition to the 'Unit Books.' This excellent series 
is now issued by the Unit Book Publishing Co., suc- 
cessors to Mr. Howard Wilford BeU. 

The forthcoming biography of Kate Greenaway 
by Messrs. M. H. Spielmann and 6. S. Layard, 
which Messrs. Putnam are to publish at once, will 
contain some fifty hitherto unpublished letters 
written by Buskin to Miss Greenaway. 

Two important volumes of essays announced by 
Messrs. Bell of London are Mr. Walter Crane's 
'Ideals in Art' and Mr. J. Churton Collins 's 
'Studies in Poetry and Criticism.' It it to be hoped 
that both books may find their way to this country. 

A volume of lectures by Mr. J. G. Frazer, the 
author of that remarkable book 'The Golden 
Bough,' is announced by Messrs. Macmillan. They 
deal with the early history of kingship as an insti- 
tution, and they sketch a general theory of its 
evolution. 

The authorized English translation of Mr. Louis 
iSb^'s 'La Vie Future' has been secured for publi- 
cation in this country by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & 
Co. This work, first issued in Paris a few months 
ago, has aroused a great deal of discussion in sci- 
entific and religious circles throughout France. 

' The Bitter Cry of the Children ' is the title of a 
book bj' Mr. John Spargo, which the Macmillan 
Co. will publish in a few weeks, with an introduc- 
tion by Mr. Robert Hunter. The volume is a 
searching examination of the effects of poverty 
upon children. 

Two important reference works for collectors to 
be published immediately by Mr. Elliot Stock of 
London are the nineteenth annual volume of 'Book 
Prices Current' and the second year's issue of Mr. 
George East's 'Collector's Annual.' The last- 
named work is a record of the year's auction sales 
of art objects other than books. 

The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the 
birth of Crabbe was celebrated recently in the 
poet's home town of Aldeburgh. The features of 
the occasion were an exhibition of manuscripts and 
personal relics of the poet, addresses by Mr. 
Thomas Hardy, Mr. Clement K. Shorter, and others, 
and a series of tahleatii vivants illustrative of cer- 
tain incidents in Crabbe 's life. 

Three interesting Wordsworth books are an- 
nounced by Mr. Henry Frowde. The first is 'Poems 
and Extracts, chosen by William Wordsworth' for 
an album presented to Lady Mary Lowther, Christ- 
mas, 1819. It is printed literally from the original, 
with facsimiles, and has an introduction by Pro- 
fessor H. Littledale, and a preface by Mr. J. Rogers 
Rees. Another is 'Wordsworth's Literary Criti- 
cism in Prose,' with an introduction by Mr. Nowell 
C. Smith; and the third, 'Wordsworth's Guide to 
the Lakes,' with an introduction by Mr. E. de 
Selincourt.

THE DIAL, 



[Nov. 1, 



A complete and carefully collated edition of Coo- 
per's Poems, edited by Mr. H. S. Milford, will soon 
be added by Mr. Henry Frowde to his Oxford edi- 
tions of the poets. Mr. Frowde has lately taken 
over the 'World's Classics,' formerly issued by Mr. 
Grant Richards, and is making arrangements to add 
a number of new volumes to the series. 

Tte publication of Mr. Herbert Paul's Life of 
Froudc has been postponed for a few weeks, as the 
author received at the last moment permission to 
include a collection of letters which will add con- 
siderably to the interest of the work. Mr. Froude "s 
family have given Mr. Paul access to valuable bio- 
graphical material in their possession, and the life 
may therefore be considered authoritative. 

The volume of 'New Collected Rhymes' by Mr. 
Andrew Lang, which Messrs. Longmans, Green, & 
Co. will publish this Fall, contains three ballads, of 
which two at least — * The Young Ruthven ' and ' The 
Queen of Spain ' — were written in competition with 
the street minstrels of the close of the sixteenth 
century; 'Cricket Rhymes,' 'Jubilee Poems,' 'Loyal 
Lyrics, ' and a number of verses which are described 
as 'Critical of Life, Art, and Literature.' 

The publishers of 'Scribner's Magazine' have 
issued an attractive pamphlet embodying a sum- 
mary of the most important contents of that peri- 
odical since its commencement in 1887, with numer- 
ous reproductions of noteworthy illustrations that 
have appeared in its pages. This pamphlet is well 
worth possessing for its own sake, but is particu- 
larly interesting as emphasizing the high literary 
and artistic standards that have always character- 
ized this sterling magazine. 

Popular interest in all that pertains to Abraham 
Lincoln is decidedly on the increase, if the plans 
of publishers may be taken as an indication. We 
have already mentioned in these pages the elab- 
orate ten-volume edition of Lincoln's writings 
which Messrs. Putnam have in active preparation, 
and also the important revision of Hay and Nico- 
lay's work to be issued by the F. D. Tandy Co. 
The announcement now reaches us of a series of 
papers on 'Lincoln the Lawyer,' by Mr. Frederick 
Trevor Hill, which will form the leading serious 
feature of the 'Century Magazine' during the 
coming year; and of a 'Boys' Life of Lincoln,' by 
Miss Helen Nicolay, a daughter of the President's 
secretary, which will occupy a foremost place ii; 
the forthcoming issues of 'St. Nicholas.' Finally 
may be mentioned the new revised edition of Miss 
M. Louise Putnam's 'Children's Life of Lincoln,' 
just published by Messrs. McClurg & Co.

THE LITERARY MART. 



The leading feature of ' The Atlantic Month- 
ly ' for Xovember is an article upon ' The Com- 
mercialization of Literature/ by the veteran 
publisher, Mr. Henry Holt. It is, in form, an 
examination, with much discursive comment, 
of the ideas set forth in the little book called 
' A Publisher's Confession,' issued anonymously 
a few months ago. That book, it wiU be re- 
membered, was a series of heart-to-heart talks 
with authors, in which much was said of the 
recent deterioration of the ancient and honor- 
able profession of publishing into the mere 
business of book-manufacture; these statements 
being coupled with a protest against the ten- 
dency to deal with the products of author- 
ship upon exclusively commercial principles. 
It was a book which combined a certain ele- 
ment of sound thinking with perhaps an equal 
element of unconscious humor. Of the former 
element, we had something to say when we dis- 
cussed the book early last summer. Of the lat- 
ter, we may content ourselves with remarking 
that it rested chiefly upon the fact that the 
spirit of commercialism was implicit in the 
very arguments which were aimed against it. 
This fact was discovered by Mr. Bernard Shaw, 
and exposed with something more than his 
usual degree of humorous exaggeration, in a re- 
view which designated the writer of the *Con- 
fession' as a 'high-minded shark.' Mr. Holt, 
also, we should say, has examined the book with 
the same sort of insight, but he speaks of it in 
suaver accents, and suppresses the satirical note 
in his comments. It is not, however, because 
of its reflective relation to the small volume in 
question that we are now about to speak of Mr. 
Holt's article, but because anything that Mr. 
Holt has to say about the relation of publishers- 
to authors and the reading public must be in 
the highest degree authoritative; must have,, 
indeed, far more weight than anything said ini 
the book which he takes for his text. That book 
embodies the ideas of the 'enterprising' houses 
of recent origin; our magazine essayist repre- 
sents the old-time tradition of dignified Amer- 
ican publishing. When, for example, at the 
conclusion of his discussion, he writes as fol- 
lows, we are bound to realize that a very seri- 
ous issue is offered by present-day conditions: 

' The literature of our mother tongue has been 
commercialized to an extent not dreamed of in any 



296 



THE DIAi 



[Nov. 16, 



time of which I have knowledge; and — let him 
who will say post hoc propter hoc — within our 
generation our literature has fallen to a lower 
estate than it knew for generations before.' 

Something better than the cry of 'pessimist' 
must be used to meet so grave a charge as this 
from so respectable a source. Others may seek 
to meet the charge (or to refute the calumny) 
if they will; we are not moved to join in the 
attempt, because we believe that Mr. Holt is 
substantially justified in his contention. We 
think, moreover, that he has indicated with 
considerable precision the specific sort of com- 
mercialization which has brought about these 
deplorable consequences. Complete analysis of 
so complex a problem is hardly to be expected 
in a single paper of magazine dimensions, but 
our author cannot be far from right when he 
singles out for chief emphasis the malign in- 
fluence of the 'literary agent' and the resort of 
the publishing trade (for this occasion 'trade' 
seems to be the right word) to reckless extrava- 
gance in advertising. 

Taking first the question of the literary 
agent, it is urged that he has so undermined 
the old confidential relation between publisher 
and author as to create suspicion where trust 
formerly existed, and to work mischief with 
both of the parties between whom he has in- 
terposed his services. The old system of mu- 
tual obligation has given way to a system in 
which authors are persuaded to make ill-ad- 
vised demands of their publishers, threatening 
to turn elsewhere if the demands are not ai-c- 
ceded to, and publishers no longer dare to 
work for the future, — ^that is, for the steady 
upbuilding of the reputations of the men whose 
books they publish. An author owes his first 
success to the services of his publisher, and 
straightway his next book, which should nat- 
urally go to the same house, is hawked about 
the market by the wily agent — intent only 
upon commissions — and sold to the highest 
bidder. The publisher, under these circum- 
stances, or anticipating these conditions, will 
naturally cease to concern himself with his au- 
thor's future interests. As for the author, he 
will find in the long run that his gain has been 
elusive; he may have received larger lump 
sums than would otherwise have been the case, 
but his books, scattered among perhaps half a 
dozen publishers, will not support each other, 
and the income from them will tend to become 
a vanishing quantity. 

Turning now to the question of advertising, 
we find a most emphatic condemnation of the 
recent wild extravagance of publishers. 'I 
cannot but think,' says Mr. Holt, 'that lately 
many American publishers were as crazy about 



advertising as the Dutch ever were about tulips, 
or the French about the Mississippi Bubble.* 
When publishers resort to the methods of de- 
partment stores, and fill whole pages in the 
daily newspapers with the brazen laudation of 
their wares, it is time for someone to prick the 
bubble of this particular folly; and this our 
writer has most effectively done. 

* There is the advertising that appeals to the 
eye, and the advertising that appeals to the in- 
telligence. One shapes popular habit, independent- 
ly of deliberation; everybody has eyes, and every- 
body uses food and shoes; so this kind of ad- 
vertising may take root anywhere and it pays to 
scatter it. But the eighty million people using 
food and shoes in the United States did not in- 
clude a hundred thousand who would buy a single 
book advertised last year, and probably do not 
include fifty thousand who spend as much on 
books as they do on shoes. Whatever the number, 
they are the very people least affected by the sort 
of advertising that appeals to habit. Let them 
know sufficiently clearly what there is in the 
market that they may care for, and they will 
make up their minds whether they want it or not; 
and the more damnable iteration you bother them 
with, the more apt you will be to turn them 
away. ' 

Discrimination in advertising is of course the 
remedy for extravagance. The writer of 'A 
Publisher's Confession' speaks of houses that 
spend such sums as a quarter of a million an- 
nually. It ought to be fairly clear that no such 
sum as this can be spent by a single house with- 
out wasting the greater part of it. Such ex- 
penditure is merely advertising at random, 
without practically any attempt to select the 
proper medium. The same writer speaks slight- 
ingly of advertisements inserted in ' those pub- 
lications that go only to the literary class,' 
calls them 'superfluous,' and says that their 
main use is 'to keep pleasant the relations be- 
tween the publishers and these journals.' This 
truly amazing opinion receives scant courtesy 
from Mr. Holt, who from the vantage-ground 
of forty years' experience has learned that the 
sort of advertising thus contemptuously dis- 
missed is the only kind that really counts. To 
him, the ' very few thousand persons ' who 
learn about the appearance of new books from 
the literary journals ' are the only persons to 
whom books can be profitably advertised; and 
a book's fate is sealed by what is said about it 
by them.' The gist of the whole matter ap- 
pears to be found in our essayist's dictum that 
although 'publishers' advertisements seem to 
be in great part wasted as far as the large ma- 
jority of the public is concerned, they can ap- 
peal to their special public through special or- 
gans.' This strikes us as an eminently sane 
opinion. 

As far as Mr. Holt's argument raav be 



1905.] 



THE DIAI. 



297 



summed up in concise form, it is found in the 
following paragraph: 

' Mv opinion, based npon a very long experi- 
ence, is that the remarkable concurrence of the 
manv exceptional conditions I have described — 
the piracy under the old non-copyright license, the 
chaos of the transition from the old license to the 
new law, the advertising mania, the mad compe- 
tition stimulated by the literary agents, — has 
produced a strange and abnormal condition in 
publishing, and that this condition is destructive 
and cannot last. It has already wrought great 
ruin, and how much more ruin it must work 
before a healthy condition can arise, and how 
that ruin can be minimized, is matter for anxious 
consideration. One class of remedies is clear, if 
the trade has character enough to apply them, — 
more subordination of the present to the future, 
more avoidance of petty games that two can play 
at, more faith in the business value of the Goldefi 
Rule, more feeling for the higher possibilities of 
their " profession," and more plain, homely, com- 
monplace self-respect. The publishers probably 
have their human share of the needed virtues, but 
they have been strangely and sorely tried.' 

What is commercialism in literature? It is 
the effort on the part of the publisher to make 
the cheap manufacture and the extensive sell- 
ing of books his foremost aim. It is the effort 
on the part of the author to write what will 
sell the best, and to accept the highest bid 
that is made for his work, irrespective of all 
other considerations. And what is profession- 
alism in literature? It is the determination 
on the part of the publisher to eschew specula- 
tion, to adhere to the old-fashioned code of eth- 
ics, to think more of the dignity and responsi- 
bility of his occupation than of its cash returns. 
It is the decision on the part of the author to 
exert his powers for the general welfare rather 
than for the largest personal gain, to write well 
rather than to write much, and to recognize 
that in his relations with the publisher he has 
obligations no less than rights. Publishing and 
authorship alike ma}' degenerate from profes- 
sions into trades, if sordid and short-sighted 
motives are allowed to prevail. The same con- 
siderations that apply to journalism apply also 
to book-making ; the promoter of the * yellow ' 
newspaper has his counterpart in what we may 
fairly call the ' yellow ' publisher, and the jour- 
nalist who utters for hire opinions that are not 
his own has his counterpart in the author who 
deliberately panders to a vulgar popular taste. 
* There are some pursuits,' says Mr. Holt, ' in 
which it is almost as dangerous to make money 
the main end, as in the general conduct of life 
it is to make personal happiness the main end; 
and the higher the pursuit, the greater the 
danger.' It is one thing to earn a decent liv- 
ing by honorable means ; it is quite another to 
gain a fortune by the abandonment of ideals 
and the degradation of activities to a lowered ' 
level of purpose. 



SIR HENRY IRVING AND HIS ART. 

In the annals of the stage, no actor ever 
aroused such discussion or elicited such widely 
divergent opinions from critical minds as Sir 
Henry Irving. Mr. William Archer said that 
English critics, * obeying an inevitable tendency 
of dramatic criticism, made Irving a law unto 
himself.' Yet at the announcement of a new 
production by him, a desire to pay a tribute of 
respect to her greatest histrionic artist inspired 
the inhabitants of London, and demonstrated 
itself with a force which old play-goers regard 
as unprecedented save in the later days of 
Macready. Professional critics celebrated the 
event by lengthened dissertations on Irving's 
peculiarities, weaving a net of categories, of 
votive offerings, regulated by the aesthetic judg- 
ments held of the most purely intellectual and 
the most picturesque of modem English-speak- 
ing actors. While one would praise him for 
emancipating the stage from a cold, artificial, 
declamatory stjie, — as if coldness and art were 
inseparable terms, — another would strive to 
prove that the actor was no genius, because 
what he did was the result of labor, — as though 
genius were not in itself an impulse to labor, 
and true conscientious labor were not one of 
the exponents of genius. This recalls a re- 
mark made by Irving at rehearsal : * So you 
have been desecrating our orisons with curious 
eyes, eh? Eehearsals are like prayers of the 
faithful; here we confess our manifold incom- 
pleteness at the altar of Art, and supplicate for 
strength to do better — to finally achieve the 
highest. This is the confessional.' Still an- 
other critic would discuss the actor's internal 
motives and peculiarities of temperament, as- 
sure us that the true function of the stage is to 
be a pronouncing dictionary of the language, 
and that the dialect spoken was a dialect of 
his own, an Irving patois; while another would 
give his meed of applause because the actor ex- 
hibited actualities rather than poetic crea- 
tions, — as if the principle were established, 
perchance, that the individual man is to be rep- 
resented, rather than the man ideally elevated. 
On the other hand, we cannot sanction the 
critic who overlooks the duties of his voca- 
tion, — who puts up with a fault in considera- 
tion of a beauty, who passes over an imperfect 
elocution for the sake of an evident inspiration 
of genius, who apologizes for a mannerism for 
the sake of the substratum of intellect which 
it partially covers. 

The preeminent position attained by Sir 
Henry Irving, which met with hearty recogni- 
tion in America, has legitimated the verdict 
expressed by Sir Bulwer Lvtton at the farewell 



298 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



dinner given to Macready over half a century 
ago : ' Every great actor has his manner, as 
every great writer has his style. But the orig- 
inality of an actor does not consist in his man- 
ner alone, but in his depth of thought.' Some 
one has said that to achieve only a respectable 
success in a round of parts is to accomplish 
much; but to have maintained through them 
all a high altitude of merit, and more than 
once to have risen to the pinnacle of greatness, 
is to have established beyond question a rank 
with the foremost actors of the world. 

The artist who labors worthily in any de- 
partment of art is certain of respect, not to say 
reverence. The great actor is infinitely more 
necessary to reproduce the author's idea of a 
play, than a good musical director is required 
for"^the understanding of a great musical com- 
position; you can set tunes and harmonies to 
notes, but not words and sentences to declama- 
tion. The actor is the real hypothetes of the 
prophet, the interpreter of his meaning, and 
his whole being — his body, mind, and soul — 
are required for performing that task. One of 
the gravest difficulties in writing about the 
stage, according to our venerable critic, Mr. 
William Winter, is the need that the occupa- 
tion seems to impose of universality of sapience 
and finality of judgment. ' No man can so en- 
tirely comprehend the works of Shakspeare, — 
in all their height and depth of meaning, and 
all their variety and subtlety of suggestion, — 
and at the same time so thoroughly probe the 
natures of the actors who pass before him, as to 
be able to settle all questions as to compati- 
bility between the two.' 

As was said of Edwin Booth, it may be said 
that some of Irving's Shakespearian ideals 
may not have matched exactly with Shake- 
speare's conceptions. But intellectuality, ar- 
tistic propriety, and unfaltering intensity of 
purpose cast over each interpretation a charm 
which grew into a tie of esteem, binding the 
public to the artist, — a tie which gradually 
strengthened during a long series of years and 
was strongly expressed by the demeanor of an 
Irving audience. 

' Deep the oak must sink in stubborn earth Its roots 
obscure, 
That hopes to lift its branches to the sky.' 

Irving was first of all an intellectual actor. 
He worked from a conception, at a time when 
others worked according to tradition. He 
practiced that art of dissecting and diagnosis 
which ' opens new veins and strikes new arteries 
in the most intricate shield of classicism.' His 
tendency was to the natural rather than to the 
ideal, to the concrete rather than the abstract. 
Exception to this general statement may be 
found in his repertory, but it is near enough to 



the truth when only generalities are possible. 
The more definite features a part presented,, 
the more complete was his impersonation. He 
often stated that Kean blended the Realistic 
with the Ideal in acting, and founded a school 
of which William Charles Macready was the 
foremost disciple in England. He believed 
that in acting. Nature must dominate Art, but 
at the same time Art must interpret Nature, 
and to interpret the thoughts and emotions of 
her mistress should be her first object. Those 
thoughts, those emotions, must be ' interpreted 
with grace, with dignity, and with temperance; 
and these, let us remember. Art alone can 
teach.' 

Those actors who have greatly excelled in 
finished declamation have often failed to please 
the critical mind, which cares more for evi- 
dence of inspiration than for training. A 
peculiarity of utterance and of gesture, which 
cannot be conveyed otherwise than by imita- 
tion, was a most important element in Irving's 
performance. But by the cultivation of this 
elaborate style of speech and gesture he at- 
tained an expression of certain emotions that 
no other artist ever approached. Every word 
of an entire play seemed to have been studied 
with the view of thoroughly ascertaining its- 
capability; and the spectator was surprised at 
finding a striking significance elicited from an 
apparently unimportant line. The strongest 
exhibitions of passion would sometimes seem- 
ingly throw him into a rant, and the organs of 
speech would seem to crack under the violence 
of his enunciation; but the manner in which 
he would turn this peculiarity, half-mental and 
half-physical, to account in the ironical touches- 
by which he relieved the graver passages of 
tragedy, proved a striking example of how 
hatred or jealousy, blended with contempt, 
may be told by ejaculation. Of calm, deliber- 
ate, caustic irony, he was a most consummate 
master. 

Irving was thoroughly absorbed in his work. 
Be it Hamlet or Mathias, Lesurques or Dubosc, 
Charles I. or Louis XI., we find in him that 
intellectual concentration, that innate human 
sympathy, that careful adjustment of delicate 
shading, that exquisite finish, which betokens 
at once a sincerity of purpose, a reproductive 
and creative faculty, characteristic of the ar- 
tistic temperament. It was M. Coquelin who 
said in the Irving- Coquelin controversy some 
years ago, that the actor's feelings must never 
be real, that the actor's inner consciousness 
and intellectual purpose must watch over and 
direct and control the actor's exterior machin- 
ery. The remark was looked upon by Irving 
as 'a. stultifying delusion that the votary of

acting is bound to worship everything dramatic 
that comes out of France.' In personating a 
character, Irving identified himself so entirely 
with his part that his face flushed or paled 
with the varying excitement of his character; 
the mobility of his features proved to us that a 
personality of infinite susceptibility was before 
us. Whether portraying the complex emotions 
of life or the convergent subsidence of death, 
he was, in look, voice, and attitude the vibrant 
impersonation of his theme. 

His acting was done under a peculiarly high 
intensity, so much so that his performance of 
Hamlet was unaccompanied by the vulgar pat- 
ronizing forms of applause; the possibility of 
losing a significant look or gesture was so great 
that the tragedy was respectfully heard 
throughout. This intensity was even more 
noticeable in his impersonation of Mathias in 
' The Bells,' where the two predominant ideas 
portrayed are remorse and fear. Perfect as 
was his command over each separate element 
of expression, it was still the harmonious con- 
currence with which all were brought to bear at 
once in the rendering of every thought and 
feeling of the part that constituted the distin- 
guishing quality of his acting ; a remark so true 
that one need but to have heard him read a 
single scene in a drawing-room, with none of 
the scenic aids to dramatic effect about him, 
yet supplying them all by this concurrent mo- 
bility of feature, voice, and gesture, to be con- 
vinced that therein lay the chief secret of his 
power. 

Perhaps the most fascinating characteriza- 
tion in Irving's repertory was his Louis XI., — 
an analytical and many-colored portrayal of old 
age and craven ambitions. Instead of subor- 
dinating Xature to Art, he pressed all the re- 
sources of Art into the service of Xature, mod- 
elled every motive of his acting upon the reali- 
ties of life, so that in his most impetuous, most 
terrible, most pathetic portrayal of the old 
fanatic of Yalois, he never overstepped the 
truth. Again, in his embodiment of Robes- 
pierre we had an example of the actor's faculty 
for getting into his character. It was a sym- 
metrical presentation. Declamation was ' no 
part of it. The lines of the character were 
spoken so simply and naturally that there was 
never a moment during the play when the il- 
lusion disappeared. The whole was an authen- 
tic and convincing picture of one of the most 
appalling and destructive political-social con- 
vulsions in human history. 

The biographer of Edwin Booth pointed out 
that it is not the number of parts an actor plays 
that constitutes his strength or reveals his re- 
sources; it is the height, fineness, and diver- 
sity of mind and spirit, the depth of feeling. 



the control of action, the knowledge of human 
nature, the faculty of simulation, and the 
trained ability, combined in his treatment of 
any one part, which, taken together, make up 
his sum. Rather than use the word versatility 
in connection with Irving, let us say he was 
comprehensive, — for so many characterizations 
created within the range of his art are equal 
one to the other. He possessed a mind suffi- 
ciently cx)mprehensive to portray with scholar- 
ship and taste what may be considered his 
greatest characters: Shylock, Hamlet, Mephis- 
topheles, Don Quixote, King Lear, Becket, 
Wolsey, Robespierre, Richard III., Louis XI.,. 
and Mathias in ' The Bells,' — a poetic, pictures- 
que, and brilliant group. 

The philosophic way in which Sir Henry 
Irving spoke of the proper dignity of the drama 
has in it a conservative and vital tone which is 
an honor to its author. 

* In the consideration of the art of acting, it 
must never be forgotten that its ultimate aim is* 
beauty. Truth itself is only an element of beauty» 
and to merely reproduce things vile and squalid is 
a debasement of Art. Life, with all its pains 
and sorrows', is a beautiful and a precious gift; 
and the actor's art is to reproduce this beautiful 
thing, giving due emphasis to those royal virtues 
and those stormy passions which sway the destinies 
of men. Thus the lesson given by long experi- 
ence — by the certain punishment of ill-doing — 
and by the rewards that follow on bravery, fore- 
bearance, and self-sacrifice, are on the mimic stage 
conveyed to men. And thus every actor who is 
more than a mere machine, and who has an ideal 
of any kind, has a duty which lies beyond the 
scope of his personal ambition. His art must be 
something to hold in reverence if he wishes other* 
to hold it in esteem. There is nothing of chance 
about his work. All, actors and audience alike, 
must bear in mind that the whole scheme of the 
Drama is not to be regarded as a game in life 
which can be played with varying success. Its 
present intention may be to interest and amuse, 
but its deeper purpose is earnest, intense, sincere,*

The little volume of 'Love Poems of John 
Donne,' recently issued in a limited edition by the 
Riverside Press, is of unusual interest on several 
accounts. In the first place, its outward appear- 
ance is such that no lover of fine bookmaking 
could fail to rejoice in its possession. Then it 
gives us in convenient form perhaps the best work 
of a poet not easily accessible to the casual pres- 
ent-day reader. Finally, the name of Charles Eliot 
Norton on the title-page, as editor, would insure 
permanent value to a much less interesting publi- 
cation than this. Professor Norton is the for- 
tunate owner of some Donne manuscripts, and he 
has utilized these so far as they go in collating 
the present text. He contributes also a short but 
illuminating introduction, and a few necessary 
notes. It is not to be supposed that Donne will 
ever be very widely read or appreciated, but this 
little book should do much to make his work bet- 
ter known among poetry lovers. The volume is a 
slender duodecimo in form, printed from Caslon 
type on antique handmade paper, and bound in 
paper-covered boards with parchment back.

The French People in Their Homes.* 



If the average intelligent American were 
questioned, never so leniently, as to his ideas 
of home life in France, it is pretty certain that 
his answers would be the confession of an ig- 
norance at once profound and elemental. If 
he had been put through a course in the history 
of the French Eevolution, he might dimly re- 
call some of the citations from Arthur Young's 
Travels to be found in the foot-notes of his 
Mignet, Guizot, Thiers, or Carlyle; or if he 
had been so well-advised as to read Mr. Brown- 
ell's brilliant essay on ' French Traits,' he 
might claim to have been at least introduced 
to some of the controlling tendencies in the na- 
tional character. But until he had read care- 
fully such a book as this of Miss Betham-Ed- 
wards, his ideas on the social life of that great 
and minutely ordered community would prob- 
ably be either non-existent or mostly wrong. It 
is not to the point that the Frenchman in 
France has equally fantastic conceptions, if 
any, of home life in America, until he has been 
more or less correctly informed thereon by the 
Reisebilder of such agreeable writers as Mme. 
Th. Bentzon, M. Max O'Rell, or the Abbe 
Klein. Fabula de te: this book was not writ- 
ten fon Frenchmen, nor indeed for Americans, 
the point of view and all the standards of com- 
parison being strictly British; but the need of 
it is at least as great in the United States as 
in Great Britain, and the value of it is in direct 
proportion to the depth of the ignorance which 
it is calculated to remove. 

This volume is something more than the re- 
sult of an ' international episode ' or the expan- 
sion of a summer traveller's note-book. The 
author. Miss M. Betham-Edwards, has qualified 
herself, by a residence of more than twenty 
years in various parts of France, and by shrewd 
and continuous observation, to speak with inti- 
mate knowledge of the subjects she treats. 
Some of the chapters have already appeared as 
papers in the ' Comhill ' and other English 
magazines; and, together with much addi- 
tional material, have finally been gathered into 
a comprehensive description of French domestic 
and social life. She evidently loves her French ; 
and her general note is one of hearty admira- 
tion for the wonderful qualities of thrift, in- 
dustry, good taste, and ingenuity, by means of 
which the French do many things just a little 
better than any other people. Against the tra- 
ditional charge of being a frivolous and vola-

tile race, she vigorously defends them; assert- 
ing that ' the French nation is, on the con- 
trary, the most serious nation in the world.' 
With this the reader will probably compare the 
following paragraphs, which occur a little 
further on (p. 261) : *Why, in a pre-eminent- 
ly intellectual and fastidious people, do we 
find an undisguised, immoderate addiction to 
le gros rire, an insatiable appetite for the gro- 
tesquely laughable? . . . Every French- 
man has a touch of Rabelais, of Voltaire, in 
his composition. . . . Laughter — the co- 
pious exercise of the risible faculties — is a 
constitutional, a physical need of the Gallic 
temperament.' In explanation. Miss Betham- 
Edwards reminds us that 'no wave of Puri- 
tanism has at any time swept over the land of 
Eabelais ' ; and she doubtless would ask us to 
discriminate between cheerfulness and frivol- 
ity, — though she herself can only close her in- 
quiry with another question : ' How came it 
that "L' Allegro" was written by an Anglo- 
Saxon and a Puritan, and not by a Frenchman ? 
The matter must remain an eternal mystery.' 

How thoroughly the importance of the fam- 
ily as the social unit is recognized by the au- 
thor may be gathered from the fact that seven 
of the thirtv-five chapters have the following 
titles: 'The Baby,' 'The Girl,' 'The Boy,' 
'Brides and Bridegrooms,' 'Wives and Mothers,' 
'The Family Council,' 'The Code Civil and 
Family Life' ; while the allied topics of ' House- 
keeping ' and ' Domestic Service ' are given 
a luminous exposition which contains for the 
much-tried American housekeeper information, 
suggestion — and here and there a bit of con- 
solation. 

Miss Betham-Edwards is no lover of militar- 
ism, and has only condemnation for the uni- 
versal conscription, whose crushing burdens she 
so vividly depicts. But she has great hopes 
from the new laws reducing the term of service 
from three years to two, as promising financial 
economy and the rectification of grave abuses. 
As for the French officer of to-day, she defends 
him from ' insular misconception ' in the fol- 
lowing words : ' Is he not pictured as a light- 
hearted, inconsequent, dashing fellow, a some- 
thing of the D'Artagnan, a something of the 
Charles O'Malley about him, professional duties 
sitting lightly upon his shoulders, domestic 
cares quite shaken off? True to life were a 
directly opposite portrait, — that of an inde- 
fatigable worker, one to whom fireside joys 
and intellectual pleasures are especially dear, 
and to whom self-abnegation in the loftiest as 
well as the domestic sense becomes a second 
nature.' 

The author has been especially interested in 
educational questions; and she has carefully

THE DIAL

studied the system of French schools as re- 
formed under the beneficent Ferry laws of 
1881-2, whose praises she is always sounding. 
How thoroughly she has gone into this matter 
may be estimated from the fact that she has 
been made an ' officier de I'instruction publique/ 
as well as from the fulness and sympathy with 
which she describes the village schoolmaster 
and the lycees for boys and girls. 

Two pleasant chapters are those on ' My 
Friend the Cure ' and ' The Protestant Pastor,' 
in which two very amiable characters fairly 
contest with each other for the reader's favor, 
and are probably brought into closer proximity 
on the printed page than they are in real life, 
to judge from the following paragraph : * Here 
I will mention that, although the Catholic and 
Protestant population live harmoniously side 
by side, intermarriages are rare, and the rival 
churches neither gain nor lose adherents to any 
appreciable extent. Between Protestant pas- 
tor and Catholic priest in any part of France 
there is no kind of intercourse whatever. They 
stand aloof from each other as French and Ger- 
mans in the annexed provinces.' 

On these and other topics. Miss Betham-Ed- 
wards discourses with intelligent vivacity and 
good humor, lightening our darkness, gently 
removing the prejudice bom of ignorance, and 
steadily building up the respect that rests on 
knowledge. Her style is easy and colloquial, 
occasionally careless: e. g., Hhe utterance of 
Voltaire's scathing utterance' (p. 202), and 
such arbitrar}^ spellings as ' occulist,' ' Chi- 
cagan,' and ' Mrs. Jellaby.' There are also 
a few slips in the proof-reading; but the book 
is on the whole well-printed, and is beautifully 
illustrated with twenty reproductions from 
photographs and paintings by French artists.

BEGIXXrjfGS OF THE CERAMIC ART.* 



Clay in its natural state is proverbially val- 
ueless, yet it is capable of being rendered al- 
most priceless by the application to it of scien- 
tific workmanship and artistic skill, and upon 
it depends the art called Ceramic, with its 
splendid traditions of craftsmanship, of form, 
decoration, and color. So beautiful and varied 
in character are the products of this art that 
it is invested with a peculiar charm and fas- 
cination. The plasticity of clay and its adap- 
tability to the most refined and appropriate 
forms, and its aflinity for the beautiful glazes

and enamels so often associated with pottery, 
have combined to render the subject of Ceram- 
ics of more than ordinary interest to art-stu- 
dents and to art-lovers. 

The antiquity of the ceramic art invests it 
with an additional interest. Pottery is one of 
the most universal as well as one of the sim- 
plest and yet most necessary adjuncts of a 
developing civilization. The effects of intense 
heat upon clay was doubtless one of the very 
earliest discoveries of man, and fragments of 
pottery found in cave-dwellings and in kit- 
chen-middens exhibit the earliest indications of 
the artistic instincts of the human race. Be- 
cause of its imperishable nature and intrin- 
sically small value, pottery has withstood the 
ravages of time and human greed, and so fur- 
nishes monuments (using that term in the 
quasi-technical sense current among archsBolo- 
gists) by means of which pre-historic as well 
as historic times may be studied. A potsherd 
may furnish evidence as to what steps a cer- 
tain race has taken in its progress toward 
civilization, or may throw a most instructive 
light on that race's subsequent history. The 
plastic nature of clay and its susceptibility to 
the action of fire, comprise the two elements 
which form the basis of the development of 
the potter's art. The modelling of clay into 
the forms of the physical world gave birth to 
the plastic art, under which term sculpture 
is still known. It was by the invention of the 
potter's wheel, ascribed in turn to all the 
great nations of antiquity, and indicated in its 
complete development on Egyptian monuments, 
that the art of the potter advanced beyond 
mere utilitarianism, and from an industrial to 
a fine art, and began its mission among the 
things which beautify life. 

As in architecture and sculpture, so in pot- 
tery, Greece excelled all the other nations of 
antiquity. Vases were of far greater impor- 
tance to the life of the Greeks than we can 
readily appreciate in these days. To them, a 
vase might serve as a receptacle for food and 
drink, for storage, or for the adornment of 
the home. It was used in the daily life of the 
living, and was buried with the dead. Vase- 
making and vase-painting were among the 
most conspicuous industries of Athens, where 
the potters were called Prometheans (from 
Titus Prometheus, who made man out of clay) . 
The manufacture of pottery, though lucrative, 
was not held in high esteem among the Athen- 
ians. Nevertheless, the names of some of the 
potters have come down to the present day. 
When the science of archaeology arose, the 
vases of Greece, especially those that were dec- 
orated with painted scenes, were found of great 
value as furnishing monuments from which to

study the life, the art, and the mythology of 
the Greeks; and with the advance made by the 
scientific explorers in Athens and the mate- 
rials gathered up elsewhere, the study of Greek 
pottery has become ' one of the most ad- 
vanced and firmly based branches of classical 
archaeology/ 

In the seventeenth century the fashion arose 
in Western Europe and Great Britain of mak- 
ing journeys to Italy and Greece and bring- 
ing back whatever spoils of travel might at- 
tract the attention. It was then that the pot- 
tery of classical times began to receive notice 
and collections began to be made. Interest 
therein was stimulated by the publications of 
Winckelmann about a century later; about 
which time also Sir William Hamilton, some- 
time English Ambassador to Naples, formed 
there a collection of Greek and Eoman an- 
tiquities discovered in the tombs of Southern 
Italy and Etruria, brought it with him to 
England, and sold it in 1767 to the then 
newly instituted British Museum, where it 
formed the nucleus of the present magnificent 
collection in that Museum. Other collections 
were made, and with the fashion for collect- 
ing grew up a literature of the subject, con- 
sisting for the most part of catalogues, with 
more or less imperfect descriptions and illus- 
trations. 

The first adequate treatment the history of 
ancient pottery received was in the two vol- 
umes of Dr. Samuel Birch, published in 1857. 
This work grew out of a ' Catalogue of Greek 
and Etruscan Vases in the Britism Museum,' 
upon which Dr. Birch had collaborated with 
another in 1851. Birch was a versatile genius, 
— an Egyptologist, Keeper of the Department 
of Oriental Antiquities in the British Museum, 
and an expert in the field of Ceramics with a 
special genius for the detection of counter- 
feits. His 'History of Ancient Pottery' was 
regarded as a standard work, especially after 
the revision to which it was subjected in 1873, 
when it appeared in a new edition, abridged 
in some respects, enlarged in others, and em- 
bodying the fullest knowledge of the subject 
at that time. Since Birch's death, in 1885, 
so much new material has been gathered that 
a further revision of his work has been de- 
manded, and this has been successfully under- 
taken by Mr. Henry B. Walters, the Assistant 
Keeper of Greek and Eoman Antiquities in the 
same Museum, who was prepared for the task 
by the publication of his ' Catalogue of Greek 
and Etruscan Vases,' and monographs on 
* Black Figured Vases' (1893) and * Vases of 
the Latest Period' (1896). 

The results of this revision and extension 
of Dr. Birch's work are two sumptuous vol- 
umes of considerably more than five hundred 



pages each, well provided with indexes and 
bibliographies, with illustrative plates (several 
of them in color), and between two and three 
hundred text illustrations. With the excep- 
tion of the first five chapters of the first vol- 
ume (on Greek Pottery in general), which 
remain substantially as they appeared in Dr. 
Birch's edition of 1873, the work has been 
entirely rewritten, with especial attention to 
the vast gains to the knowledge of the sub- 
ject through the completion of the excavations 
of the Acropolis at Athens in 1889, and to the 
advance made since that date in the study of 
pottery, especially that of the primitive peri- 
ods. Such parts of the original work as dealt 
with Oriental Pottery have been omitted, and 
the pottery of the Celts and of Northern 
Europe is "ignored. The subject being thus 
narrowed to the Greek, Etruscan, and Eoman 
pottery, the opportunity is offered for a fuller 
treatment of the history of Greek Vase Paint- 
ing and for an epexegetic examination of the 
subjects depicted upon Greek vases, and to ac- 
cord to Etruscan and Eoman pottery almost 
the same scientific treatment as that given to 
Greek vases. 

Dr. Birch was himself so modest that he 
was content to allow much of his best work 
to appear only in the volumes of others. It 
seems to be in graceful recognition of this 
that Mr. Walters describes his books on their 
title-pages as * Based upon the work of Sam- 
uel Birch,' — ^as though he were unwilling, as 
we all should be, to have Dr. Birch's monu- 
mental work supplanted by newer volumes.

'The Jewish Spectre.'* 

x^ccepted as a semi-historical account of all 
that the Jewish race has done and left un- 
done since the beginnings of record, Mr. 
George H. Warner's 'Jewish Spectre' is a 
work of interest and value. Mr. Warner is 
essentially a collector of information. His 
work shows a truly extraordinary familiarity 
with all that has been said or written on ev- 
ery side of the question with which he deals. 
He is equally master of Bible records, Tal- 
mudic lore, higher criticism, archaeological in- 
vestigation, modern journalism, philosophy, 
sociolog}% science. He has, besides, the grace 
of humor, often denied to those who spend 
their lives among serious books. The one 
thing he lacks is a proper sense of propor- 
tion, — the sense that gives to great books a 
central idea, a beginning and an end. Mr.

Warner plays with his subject, writes all 
around it, runs all along it, keeps its great 
possibilities ever before his readers, but never 
•quite succeeds in compassing it or making 
it all his own. The interest, even to enthu- 
siasm, which increases steadily during the 
reading of the first half of the book vanishes 
^adually as the conviction grows that Mr. 
Warner will not arrive. It is all very well 
to say that the * Human Being's the Thing,' 
hut even capital letters do not make a philos- 
ophy of life or history of that postulate. It 
is very interesting, very true, and very use- 
ful, to know that Bible records are partly fic- 
tion, partly tradition, partly the history of a race 
from that race's point of view. It is easily 
admitted that the Jews have lived too much 
in a past whose glory is as largely a mat- 
ter of the chronicler's vision as of history ; that 
from earliest Old Testament times their laws 
liave been made for themselves, as the Chosen 
People, ignoring, so far as possible, the rest 
of the world; that with the Chosen People 
idea as a basis, they have been clannish, vain, 
proud, intolerant, loyal, conservative, idealistic. 
But after all this, it may be asked, what then ? 
]V[r. Warner's book is distinctly not a tirade 
against the Jews. It will be offensive to Jew- 
ish preachers and teachers, but not more so 
than to their Christian brethren against whom 
Mr. Warner inveighs with equal zest. * The 
Jewish Spectre' is based on an opposition to 
theocracy. Most of the Old Testament, he 
asserts, was written or i^vised by priests in 
the interest of priestly government. And there 
is much in the accredited results of higher 
•criticism to affirm this judgment. The relig- 
ions which to-day unite under the name of 
Christian seem to ^ir. Warner not religious 
and distinctly not Christian, but ecclesiastical. 
So far as the religion which Christ preached 
vas essentially unchurched, imdogmatic, a 
matter of the soul and not of ceremony, he is 
Tight. Mr. Warner blames the Old Testa- 
ment chroniclers, with their theocratic tenden- 
cies, for the hold which the 'Jewish Spectre' 
lias had on the mind of all peoples in all ages. 
Be blames Paul, the Jew, for propagating the 
racial tendency to submit to religion as 
authority. To him, organized religion is the 
■foundation of all opposition to progress. This 
is evidently the idea which he intends should 
he central in his book, although he never 
quite follows it to a conclusion. The only 
place where a solution is suggested is in the 
chapter on 'Tenure of Eeligions,' where Mr. 
Warner writes, in part: 

* It is not too much to hope, perhaps not too 
much to expect, that with the progress the world 
is now making, religious dominations will cease, 
that organized religion as an efifort of the human 



mind will disappear. The immense relief this 
would be to humanity can only be estimated by 
reviewing the history of the past, in which in all 
countries and in every age religions have been 
the principal burdens on the back of • humanity. 
When ccclesiasticism passes away as a political 
power and as a superstition, it will leave the Hu- 
man Being free to organize his social institutes 
according to his ever-increasing knowledge and 
intelligence, and to reorganize them whenever it 
becomes necessary — a most essential part of free- 
dom. 

'The "religion of authority," so fascinating to 
manv minds of the present day, has one weak 
link* in its chain of title. It is the impossibility 
of identifying, beyond reasonable question, the 
earthly authority with a heavenly source. The evi- 
dences of miracles, of the printed word, even of 
an irrefragable apostolic succession, are not con- 
vincing that a surrender ought to be made to such 
"authority". At the bottom of such surrender 
there is a certain loyalty to ideas, but a congenital 
disability of the imagination. For who shall tell 
us that when perishing by Protestantism, the only 
refuge is Catholicism, as though there were but 
two religious ideas. . . . Perhaps Arbitration 
points the way out, — to have nothing but free 
courts, or free courts and newspapers. Perhaps 
Socialism is the method — socialism without the 
newspaper, for then nothing would happen. So- 
cialism shocks the sense of the politician and the 
comfortable; but we must remember that the so- 
cialistic process has built a schoolhouse on every 
hill, and thrown in the text-books; it carries our 
letters almost free, makes highways, builds bridges, 
lights the streets, brings water, creates pleasure 
parks with music on Saturdays, preserves forests, 
distributes garden seeds, reguliites the weather, 
lights the shores of oceans, protects us from wild 
beasts and contagion, — and is almost the Gospel 
itself. 

'Those of us who have read the Old Testament 
remem.ber how Samuel resisted any changes in the 
administration. A pure theocracy was his highest 
ideal, and when called upon to anoint a king, he 
thought all was over, his vocation gone. Yet see 
what happened. After Saul there were more 
prophets than anything else in Israel, — and but 
for them Israel never would have been heard of. 
So it may turn out with our holy men. The the- 
ologian will find that Law, Government, and Eco- 
nomics are sciences, and not in the same realm 
with theology, and that a return to religion,- — 
which dwells in the mind of man, giving it its 
seriousness and its deepest charm, — is his best 
hold.' 

The reference to Israel's prophets and their 
relation to Israel's historic greatness (so un- 
warranted, according to Mr. Warner) illus- 
trates one of the chief weaknesses of the book. 
If it were intended as a polemic, the author 
would be justified in stating only his side of 
the case. But it is written with every inten- 
tion of fairness, to place the Jew in his 
proper historic and social relation to the rest 
of the world. Why, then, does Mr. Warner 
give credence to the prophets alone among 
Israel's teachers and scribes? Their superior 
eloquence is not a proof of their better judg- 
ment. If chroniclers of Old Testament times 
were inclined to slav a hundred thousand men

in battles in which mere material conditions 
of space precluded the presence of more than 
a tenth of that number, so Old Testament 
prophets, zealous for social, political, and 
moral reform, may be trusted to have exag- 
gerated the evil conditions of their times. In 
fact, while chroniclers have changed with the 
progress of humanity, and history is fast be- 
coming an exact science, prophets and preach- 
ers have remained the same in all ages, and 
probably will remain so to the end of time. 
Mr. Warner need only go to church or to syna- 
gogue to-day to discover how irretrievably 
wicked this world is in the eyes of these men. 
Yet somehow or other, when the sun shines it 
hardly seems so bad. 

Mr. Warner negatives too much and con- 
structs too little. He deprives the Jews of 
their heritage of religious and historic suprem- 
acy, of their superior morality, longevity, in- 
tellect, persistency, — all the attributes that 
have adorned the Spectre through the ages. 
But he gives the world nothing to build on 
in place of the accepted foundation, — nothing 
but the Human Being. And he forgets that 
the Human Being is not an unchangeable en- 
tity, but an active growing force, changing 
with the ages and only now arriving at the 
stage of development where he may be trusted 
to stand alone without the support of author- 
ity, religious, social, or governmental. Mr. 
Warner has read so much that it seems sur- 
prising that he has omitted Walter Bagehot's 
' Physics and Politics,' or that, having read 
it, the lessons of the moulds which man makes 
for himself and breaks as he outgrows should 
have escaped him. The conclusions suggested, 
if not reached, in ' The Jewish Spectre ' are 
to a large extent a matter of personal judg- 
ment. There is hardly a page in the volume 
which does not suggest a point for controversy, 
and it is likely . that no two readers will be 
impressed by the same features in just the 
same way. Edith J. Eich. 



STurnES IN Administrative IjAw.* 



Constitutional law has been thoroughly stud- 
ied in most countries, at least in most coun- 
tries that have constitutions. In the United 
States it has been a favorite theme of debate 
since the formation of the Constitution; nor 
does the interest in it show any sign of abate- 
ment. This is altogether natural, since our 
government is preeminently one of funda- 
mental laws back of and controlling our legis- 
lative and administrative activity. On the 

• The Peinciples of the Administrative Law of the 
United States. By Frank J. Goodnow, LL.D. New York : 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



other hand, the administrative side of our 
system has received comparatively little at- 
tention. The task of making a scientific analy- 
sis of it was left to a foreigner, Mr. James 
Bryce, in his ' American Commonwealth.' Dr. 
Fairlie, in his ' National Administration,' has 
given us an account of the manner in which 
the various departments of the central gov- 
ernment perform their allotted tasks; but in 
all this the real law of administration has 
received only incidental notice. In his ' Com- 
parative Administrative Law,' published twelve 
years ago. Professor Goodnow gave an analysis 
of the administrative system, national and lo- 
cal, of the United States, England, France, and 
Germany. The rapid growth of public interest 
in our own system was thought by Professor 
Goodnow a sufficient justification for a new 
book giving a fuller account of American 
conditions, with special emphasis upon the 
legal side; and this is now published with 
the title 'The Principles of the Administra- 
tive Law of the United States.' 

Administrative law is defined by Professor 
Goodnow as 'that part of the law which fixes 
the organization and determines the compe- 
tence of the authorities that execute the law, 
and indicates to the individual remedies for 
the violation of his rights.' It is partly con- 
stitutional, partly statutory, and partly ordi- 
nance and even common law. In the first 
part, or book, the author discusses the theory 
of the separation of powers, and shows that 
not only was there «o government in existence 
at the time Montesquieu wrote in which the 
theory was carried out, but that no political 
organization has ever been established in which 
there is no overlapping in the discharge of the 
three functions. The legislature frequently 
assumes or takes part in functions which really 
belong to the executive, as in 'special legisla- 
tion' (which, however, some commonwealths 
forbid) and the appointment and removal of 
officers. The reason for this is to secure polit- 
ical control. The executive, on the other 
hand, participates in the legislative power, not 
only in signing or vetoing bills, but also in 
issuing ordinances to supply deficiencies in 
legislation. This, too, is in spite of the fact 
that an effort was made to incorporate the 
theory of the separation of power into the 
American public law. For example, the first 
constitution of Massachusetts expressly forbade 
one department to exercise the functions of 
another. The Federal Constitution also prac- 
tically does the same thing in naming each 
power and providing how it shall be exercised. 
But the three powers are left undefined. If 
resort be had to judicial decisions, they will 
often be found confiicting. To find the line

of demarcation in any commonwealth, then, 
the student must examine the decisions of its 
courts. However, two general principles may 
be deduced: (1) That an act satisfies the 
requirement of separation when completely in- 
dependent of the control of the other depart- 
ments; (2) That the principle does not apply 
to local governments. 

The principle of separation cannot, in the 
nature of things, be carried to the point of 
absolute independence. The legislature regu- 
lates the administration by law, but, the ex- 
ecutive being independent of the legislature in 
tenure, it has no control over the actual ad- 
ministration except by impeachment. The 
control of the courts is somewhat greater, since 
they may declare orders, decisions, contracts, 
and ordinances null and void. Over political 
acts, however, such as making treaties, dispo- 
sition of the military forces, etc., they have no 
control. 

In discussing the Central Administration, 
Professor Goodnow brin^ out some differences 
between the powers of the President and those 
of a State Governor. The Constitutional Con- 
vention of 1787 debated for some time whether 
to provide a plural or a single executive, but 
finally agreed upon the latter and made it real. 
The growth of the ordinance power is one of 
the most noteworthy things in connection with 
the office of President. The Colonial Gover- 
nors did not have it, neither was it granted 
to the President by the Constitution. He may 
issue orders to his subordinates in the routine 
of administration which can be enforced only 
by the power of removal. The courts will not 
enforce them, neither will they abrogate them. 
On the other hand, many ordinances have 
been issued for the regulation of the army 
and nsLXj, the postal service, the internal rev- 
enue, etc., and these the courts recognize as 
having the force of law. But the most im- 
portant source of the President's power in con- 
trolling administration rests in his right of 
appointment and removal. The absolute right 
of removal was recognized by the first Con- 
gress by the casting vote of the Vice-Presi- 
dent, and has been conceded ever since with 
the exception of twenty years (1867-1887), and 
during this time the restraint was only nom- 
inal. The attempt to restrict arose out of the 
imusually strained relations between the Ex- 
ecutive and Congress in 1867. This power is 
all important, since by it the President may 
control administration in matters left by Con- 
gress to the discretion of a department officer. 
A notable use of the power was the removal 
of a Secretary of the Treasury by President 
Jackson for refusing to execute a law accord- 
ing to the President's interpretation of it. 



A State Governor, on the other hand, is 
more of a political than administrative of- 
ficer. The executive power is in reality par- 
celled out among the various State officers 
whose tenure of office is independent of the 
Governor. Not only has he no power to direct 
these officers how to carry on the work of ad- 
ministration, but they may even issue orders 
in opposition to his will. His power of ap- 
pointment and removal in the lower offices is 
generally very Kmited. Professor Goodnow 
says that a Governor, like the President, is not 
subject to the process of courts while in office. 
The writer knows of one case where a Gov- 
ernor was fined for breach of the peace, but 
cannot say whether or not the fine was ever 
collected. 

The limits of this review will not permit of 
an extended notice of the entire volume. It 
must suffice to say that the treatment of the 
subjects of the other parts is no less thorough 
than in the ones we have discussed. The vol- 
imie is a notable contribution to the literature 
of public law, and will prove of great use, not 
only to students, but also to officials in the 
actual work of administration. 

But to the writer there appears to be a few 
omissions of importance, some of which would 
probably indicate a defect in our constitutional 
law. The author points out that, while there 
are remedies against most of the positive acts 
of the administration, there is practically none 
against a refusal to act when an attempt to 
compel action by the court would bring it 
into conflict with the President. This might 
have been emphasized by the citation of cases 
in which the President ignored the decisions 
of the Supreme Court and acted upon his own 
interpretation of the law. Such was the act 
of Jefferson in withholding a commission de- 
clared by the court (Marbury vs. Madison) to 
be due the plaintiff, and by Jackson in refus- 
ing to execute the decree of the court in the 
Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia case. The case 
of ex parte Merryman, wherein the writ of 
habeas corpus was disregarded by order of the 
President, is referred to, but not for this 
specific purpose. Governors are not so far 
exempt as the President, yet no provision has 
ever been devised to compel them to obey a 
very clear mandate of the Constitution — that 
requiring the rendition of fugitives from jus- 
tice upon the demand of the Executive of the 
State from which they fled. They are left no 
discretion in the matter, yet refusals have 
been made for reasons insulting to the State 
making the demand. 

The author holds that military administra- 
tion is a thing apart, deserving of separate 
treatment. This is undoubtedly true of things

strictly military; yet a kind of civil adminis- 
tration is often administered through the mil- 
itary, and this might reasonably have been 
given at least a brief analysis. It is supposed 
to be based on some laws other than those 
of necessity, though sometimes it is difficult 
to discover any except the whim of the ad- 
ministrator. For example, it is hard to un- 
derstand how, since the decision of the Insular 
Oases, the Secretary of the Navy imposes a 
tariff in Tutuila different from (and lower 
than) our own, if it is American territory ; and 
if it is not American territory, why the Secre- 
tary of the Treasury admits goods from Tutu- 
ila into the United States free of duty. 

David Y. Thomas, 



The Pilgrim Fathers in England and 
Ho llan d.* 

So thorough and honest an historical work as 
the Dexters' ' England and Holland of the 
Pilgrims' can afford to have its merits and 
limitations known at once. Like the story of 
the Pilgrims itself, the book needs neither em- 
bellishment nor factitious advertisement. It 
may not be a ' seller,' but it will not die. This 
particular kind of work, after that of the three 
Dexters, will not require to be done again for 
a century or more. In a word, we have not 
here a flight of the imagination, but the re- 
sults of solid, long-continued, painstaking re- 
search, with correction and re-correction of the 
first work and of various mistaken impressions, 
confusions, and inferences of other writers. 

In one sense, the book is a disappointment. 
It is not a broadly sketched or framed, or even 
a brightly colored, picture of the England and 
Holland of the century of the Pilgrims. It is 
not even a sober-tinted sketch or a justifiable 
composition-piece representing in vivid text 
the two lands of home and exile trodden by 
Pilgrim feet. It is rather a selection of ele- 
ments which, by documentary proof only, are 
known to have affected the Separatists' lives 
and their church movement. It is a book made 
by bookmen. Sometimes, as we read, our 
vision is obstructed; we cannot see the forest 
on account of the trees. The grand human 
story seems lost in a mass of antiquarian de- 
tail. One longs to know more of manhood 
and womanhood, and less of theological, biblio- 
graphical, and ecclesiastical lore and discussion. 
It is all too much like undertakers' registers. 
In vain we hope to catch gleams of imaginative 
sympathy, to feel human heart-beats. In the

main, the narrative is as dry, as unadorned, as 
pragmatic, as a Chinese book of annals, — and 
as trustworthy. By this we mean the highest 
praise of the book as history. One Inay depend 
on the data, the verified references, the tabu- 
lated genealogical lists, bound to gladden and 
ease many a toiler and inquirer. Only those 
who have spent days and months ' down among 
the dead men ' who are remembered in tanta- 
lizing evanishings in Dutch script and time- 
stained print, can appreciate the toil, the pa- 
tience, the consecration to truth-seeking, the 
self-denial to all temptation to add or subtract 
from 'the written word,' which this volume 
represents. In its purity, for the feeding of 
the lamp of historical truth, it is as ' oil poured 
from vessel to vessel.' Its form is superbly 
Greek in its austere repression. There is no 
Oriental luxuriance of fancy here. 

Nearly forty years ago, Dr. Henry Martyn 
Dexter began digging, measuring and question- 
ing at Scrooby and Austerfield. Then, crossing 
the North Sea to Holland, he ransacked ar- 
chives, tax-rolls, and libraries at Ley den and 
Amsterdam. Has anyone entered into his Ali 
Baba's cave of bibliographical treasures in the 
library of Yale University at New Haven? 
Professor Franklin Dexter, the librarian there, 
took up the unfinished manuscript of the great 
Congregational bibliographer; and the son of 
the latter, himself an indefatigable pilgrim 
and investigator in the realms of Tudor and 
Stuart and of Willem and Mauritz, during 
seven visits over-seas, continued the good work. 
Few books have had such a history and such 
rich harvests reaped during three generations 
of scholarly and untiring quest. 

The old story is here told again with fresh- 
ness and with eloquence. One chapter pictures 
the economic, political, and intellectual ele- 
ments of the time when churches that were re- 
publics started in England. Others tell of the 
elements at hand for a picture, instead of paint- 
ing the picture, or even drawing the main out- 
lines of the Dutch Republic, in which the Sep- 
aratists held aloof from the numerous British 
folk in Leyden and Amsterdam. The other 
chapters deal with church polity, with the life 
of the leaders, as well as of the rank-and-file, 
of Robinson's congregation, with plans for the 
plantation in America, with notices of events 
in the years following, until all trace of the 
Pilgrims was lost from Dutch records. Lists 
of names and data of the records containing 
them, with index and maps, complete this in- 
valuable reference-book. Like flowers in the 
fleld, many books on the Pilgrims filled with 
fantasy and fiction, while claiming historical 
accuracy, have flourished in weedy luxuriance. 
Like a mowing-machine, this record of the

Derters will improve much of this wild growth 
off the face of the earth. 

Xevertheless, the ven^ excellences and limi- 
tations of Dr. Morton Dexter's volume justify 
all legitimate attempts to represent both Eng- 
land and Holland as more than lands of per- 
secution and exile, and the Pilgrim men and 
women as more than Congregatdonalists. And 
jet — beware the bigotry of the reviewer ! Let 
us not be misunderstood. Nor will Dr. Dexter 
be misrepresented, if the reader of this article 
is the reader also of the authors catholic dec- 
laration, on his final page, that the heritage of 
the Pilgrims is not for one sect, church, nation, 
or age. As broadly charitable as the burden of 
the angels' song over Bethlehem are the fine 
sentences in which, laying down his work of 
filial piety and truth-seeking. Dr. Dexter bids 
farewell to his readers.

The future historian will surely be sur- 
prised at the preponderance in our present- 
day fiction of the realistic novel concerned 
with such matters as business and political 
corruption, with social problems, and with the 
struggle between management and organized 
labor. To us, living in the midst of this tur- 
moil, the use of such matters by the novel- 
writer is natural enough; for the most dram- 
atic motives of our civilization are provided by 
these sordid class-conflicts and social diseases. 
We may wish that fiction might become a gen- 
tler art; but it would be unfaithful to its 
mission were it to ignore such obvious aspects 
of contemporaneous life as the ill-gotten for- 
tune, the political power purchased by bri- 
bery, the nerve-racking demands of our com- 
mercialized society, and the crimes committed 
in the name of humanity by labor organiza-

tions as they exist to-day. The immediate 
suggestion of these remarks is offered by two 
of the latest novels, both concerned with strikes 
and their attendant brutalities, and both writ- 
ten with a grip upon their subject which 
compels our attention. The fact that both are 
written by women is a matter of incidental 
interest only; the only surprising thing about 
it is that women should be so successful in 
mastering the essentially masculine vocabulary 
necessary for the portrayal of these rough sit- 
uations. Of these two books, 'The Grapple,' 
by Mrs. Grace MacGowan Cooke, is the sim- 
pler in construction and the more tense in dic- 
tion. The story is told about a coal mine in 
central Illinois, and has for its hero the 
owner and manager, a man of calm courage 
and abundant resource, who wins his fight in 
the face of great obstacles, but vindicates the 
right of the capitalist to retain in his own 
hands the control of his own business. All 
the leading incidents in this story might easily 
be paralleled in the actual recent history of 
the Illinois mines. The seriousness of the book 
is relieved by an element of humor, which is 
perhaps better than nothing, although it is 
humor of a rather cheap sort, for which the 
writer acknowledges indebtedness to a Mr. 
Eeed, giving him the title of ' a playing part- 
ner ' in her work. 

'The Man of the Hour' is the first full- 
grown novel that Miss Alice French has writ- 
ten. The scene is Fairport, which may be 
translated without much difficulty into Daven- 
port, the city of the author's residence. Now 
one of the characteristics of this Iowa com- 
munity is a curious blending of foreign 
strains with its native population, and it is 
just this mixture of racial elements that gives 
piquancy to the present story, at the cost, 
naturally, of its integrity of tyjpe as a novel of 
American character. An iron manufacturer 
of large interests, a self-made man and a 
rugged American, brings home with him from 
Europe a Russian wife, who is an aristocrat 
of social sympathies, indoctrinated by Tolstoy, 
aUied with the revolutionary movement, and an 
impracticable visionary. It is a sad ease of 
mismating; for there is no possibility of gen- 
uine sympathy between those two contrasted 
temperaments. From this union springs the 
boy who is the hero of the story. The mother 
is set upon winning him to her ways of think- 
ing, and the father is helpless to counteract 
her emotional and sentimental influence. When 
in due course the wife, finding her life intol- 
erable, leaves her husband and returns to the 
congenial society of the Russian exile colony 
in Switzerland, the boy has been moulded into 
a passionate little socialist, and the father

despairs. Presently the father remarries, dies 
a few years later, and leaves his fortune to 
his widow, to be held in trust for the boy until 
he shall prove himself capable of using it wise- 
ly. A certain sum, however, is given him ab- 
solutely ; and of this he proceeds to make ducks 
and drakes by going to Chicago, and casting 
in his fortunes with a labor organization. The 
time is now that of the Pullman strike of 
1894; and the money goes to the bolstering 
of that indefensible cause. The boy is now 
left * on his uppers/ and becomes a mechanic ; 
but his eyes are slowly opening, and the seamy 
side of the labor agitation is gradually dis- 
closed to him. After a while he drifts back 
to Fairport, secures employment in the very 
establishment reared by his father's efforts, 
and presently finds himself in a position of 
responsibility, and engaged in defending the 
business against the assaults of his old-time 
associates. He adopts vigorous measures for 
the defense, imports negro strike-breakers, and 
wins a sharply-contested victory in what has 
practically come to be a civil war. These 
experiences make of him a fairly clear-sighted 
man, although they do not blunt his sympa- 
thies for the toiler; and he at last comes to 
his own as a captain of industry, convinced 
that our very civilization depends upon the 
assertion of the rights of capital, and firm 
resistance to the outrageous exactions of union- 
ism. If it had not been for a vein of in- 
grained obstinacy in his character, he would 
have made this discovery long before; as it 
is, he makes it in time to save his career from 
shipwreck. The love-interest in this narrative 
is subordinate, but there is a charming hero- 
ine, and the end of the story finds her in read- 
iness to share his regenerated life. Miss 
French has given us a book of a very genial 
and human sort, and brought to it a gift of 
shrewd and sometimes humorous observation, 
such as comes only after long practice in the 
art of fiction. The ethical outcome is just, 
although there are occasions in the course of 
the action when the ethical balance seems to 
incline a trifle too much in the direction of a 
false sentimentalism. This general remark, 
we should say, applies also to Mrs. Cooke's 
novel, heretofore considered. The present tem- 
per of unionism in this country is so ugly 
and its methods so senseless or worse, that 
now is not the time for trifling or compro- 
mise, not even the time for over-indulgence 
in sympathies which might, under differing 
circumstances, be both legitimate and praise- 
worthy. When the cause of labor shows some 
inclination to purge itself of its brutal and 
criminal tendencies, then will be the time to 
deal with it in a spirit of gentleness and con- 



ciliation; until then, society cannot too sternly 
set its face against its propaganda and its 
methods. 

Melodrama for the times may serve for a 
description of 'The Giants,' by Mrs. Fremont 
Older, a California novelist whose work is 
characterized by a combination of vigor and 
crudity. The hero's first exploit, as here 
chronicled, consists in flagging, at the age of 
fifteen, a limited express train. He does it 
just for the fun of the thing, — to hear the 
conductor swear. His expectations are fully 
gratified. A little later, his father strikes oil 
on the ranch, and is fast acquiring a fortune, 
when the malign operations of the trust de- 
stroy his prospects, set fire to his property, 
and send him skyward in an ingeniously con- 
trived explosion. Then the boy registers a 
Hannibal oath to avenge his father's murder. 
Going to New York, he calls upon the oil 
magnate, and calmly informs him that his 
iniquities are soon to have their reward, and 
that his youthful visitor is to be the agent of 
the retribution. Meanwhile, there is the little 
matters of college and law-school to be dis- 
posed of; and this hurries us through the next 
few years. The youth becomes a famous foot- 
ball hero, and in due course a lawyer awaiting 
clients. These fail to appear; but our hero 
goes into politics, gets a nomination for the 
office of district attorney, and conducts a re- 
form campaign on the East Side. He wins the 
great heart of the people in this Tammany 
stronghold, partly by his speeches, but more 
effectively by his 'laying out' of the cham- 
pion slugger who is set upon him. He wins 
the election as a matter of course. Then he 
proceeds to work up a case of bribery against 
the oil magnate, secures convincing evidence, 
and lands his victim behind the bars with neat- 
ness and dispatch. The trembling magnate 
offers half of his billion dollars and a work- 
ing partnership if the young man will let 
him escape; but to no avail. The heroic youth 
of twenty-three is incorruptible, and villainy 
at last finds its match. There is a lot of * yel- 
low journalism ' in the story ; there are also 
two young women, the hero's good and evil 
genius respectively. The whole narration is 
pitched in the highest key of sensationalism, 
and the figures that take part in it have but 
slight resemblance to real human beings. 

'At the Sign of the Jack o' Lantern' is a 
story in Miss Myrtle Eeed's most whimsical 
vein. It abounds in quips and conceits, some 
of which verge upon genuine humor, while 
others are of a sort too cheap and hackneyed 
even for the funny columns of a newspaper. 
The fundam.ental invention of the story is 
highly amusing. A newly-married couple have

been left a country home by a deceased and 
unknown uncle. They take possession in the 
first chapter, and find it a rambling structure 
of grotesque plan and an unaccountable num- 
ber of bedrooms. In the next chapter their 
troubles begin, and the bedrooms are accounted 
for. It seems that innumerable parasites in 
the guise of relatives have been living upon 
the old man for many years, descending upon 
him every summer like a swarm of locusts. 
So they come this summer as usual, not know- 
ing of his demise, and when they learn of it 
they announce their intention of staying just 
the same. The new owners of the house are 
too poor-spirited to resist this imposition, and 
they presently find themselves hosts to as queer 
a collection of human oddities as were ever 
gathered under one roof. All are of one 
mind in thinking that the dear departed (who 
was a man of mystery) has left a surprise for 
them in the shape of concealed treasure, to be 
found by diligent search ; and they spend much 
of their time poking into odd comers and 
digging up the garden. In due time the sur- 
prise comes off; but it turns out to be other 
than they had fondly thought. That diabolical 
old man had planned it to come upon them 
in a most startling way, and besides the injury 
of blighted prospects, they were forced to suf- 
fer the insult of hearing certain sober truths 
spoken about them, as it were, from his grave. 
It seems that he had long endured their intru- 
sions upon his hospitality, suffering in silence, 
but planning all the while this posthumous 
revenge, and leaving his property to the un- 
known nephew who had been the only one of 
his relatives to leave him unmolested. The 
story ends with the hurried and indignant 
departure of the unwelcome guests. Miss Eeed 
has certainly provided us in this instance with 
an original form of entertainment, and the 
story should prove popular. 

*The Eeckoning' is the third in order of 
publication of the series of four or five ro- 
mances planned by Mr. Chambers to treat the 
American Revolution as it affected northern 
New York and the great landed families of 
that region. When we say that the new work 
is as good as * Cardigan,' the first of the 
series, it is hardly necessary to say more. The 
author brings to the composition of these 
books a comprehensive acquaintance with the 
general history of the period, and a minute 
knowledge of the history and customs of the 
Iroquois Confederacy, which materials he 
turns to effective romantic account. He gives 
us historical truth, wholesome excitement, and 
no small measure of literary art all at once; 
and for so much of good it would be churlish 
not to give thanks. 

'The Fortunes of the Landrays,' by Mr. 



Vaughan Kester, is a novel whose interest, 
although complicated, is remarkably well sus- 
tained. It begins and ends in an Ohio town, 
and is essentially a picture of life in that 
community; but the adventures of certain of 
its characters take us at times to the far West 
with the forty-niners, — to Salt Like City in 
the early days of Brigham Young, to the clos- 
ing scenes of the Civil War, and to the prairies 
of Kansas. The story is one of three gen- 
erations, not only of the Landrays, but of the 
other families with whose fortunes theirs are 
associated. This requires of the reader a fre- 
quent substitution of new interests for old 
ones; and the effect is rather bewildering, de- 
spite the length at which the story is told. 
But although the period of the narrative must 
extend over upwards of thirty years, the two 
principal characters remain in view all the 
time, thus giving the work a unity which oth- 
erwise it would sadly lack. We cannot say 
that Mr. Kester's characterizations are con- 
vincing, for the people whom he describes too 
frequently go off upon tangents, and do unex- 
pectedly inconsistent things. The author tries 
hard, for example, to make plausible the sud- 
den transformation of his upright and self- 
sacrificing hero into a particularly contempti- 
ble sort of rascal; but the effort is a failure. 
Nevertheless, the novel contains a great deal 
of essential truth about life in the time and 
place chosen for treatment, and its faults of 
incoherency do not prevent it from being a 
fairly readable production. 

,Wliile we have no objection to the employ- 
ment of the labor-and-capital theme in fiction, 
we think that the author bent upon using it 
should make his intentions fairly evident at 
the start. In the case of * The Ancient 
Grudge,' by Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier, we get 
well into the book before we discover that it 
is going to be a labor novel. Its opening 
chapters are so innocent of any such purpose, 
and Mr. Pier's previous novels have been con- 
cerned with matters so different, that we are 
taken fairly by surprise when we find our- 
selves in the midst of a scene chiefly occupied 
by labor agitation, walking delegates, strikers, 
riots, and all the other famiUar features of the 
present industrial unrest. It is all very vig- 
orously depicted, and the ethical treatment of 
the situation is sane enough, but the author 
does not seem to be quite in his element. In 
thus making a ' problem novel ' out of what 
had better have remained a story of private 
interest, Mr. Pier proves rather disappointing. 
The best part of his work is that which is 
least closely related to the industrial com- 
plication upon which he depends for his cli- 
max.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Couch, in ' The Mayor of Troy/ has given us 
another of his quaint and inimitable tales of 
the Cornish coast. The setting is historical, 
being that of the threatened Napoleonic inva- 
sion, whereby, indeed, hangs the substance of 
the tale. For the mayor of Troy, who is also 
major of the volunteer artillery, and a very 
important person in his bailiwick, becomes the 
victim of an extraordinary mishap midway in 
the narrative. Snatched by ruthless fate from 
the scenes of his glory, he is seized by a press- 
gang, under circumstances which preclude any 
proof of his identity, and carried off to become 
an ornament of the British navy. The ship 
which bears him is blown up off the French 
coast; he is rescued by the enemy, and lan- 
guishes ten years in a remote military prison. 
Meanwhile, after the mystery of his disap- 
pearance has defied solution for a sufficient 
length of days, ' he is given up for dead, his 
wealth is distributed according to the terms of 
his will, and Troy does him all sorts of 
posthumous honors. When he returns — but 
we will not reveal what happens, remarking 
only that it is the unexpected. The book 
presents us with one humorous situation after 
another, crowned by an invention so extraordi- 
nary that the author may fairly be said to 
have surpassed his own best previous efforts. 

Mr. Anthony Hope's latest heroine is an 
actress with a past. We do not learn what 
that past has been until we are midway in the 
book, and when the revelation is made it 
proves rather disappointing. It seems that she 
has a husband, a weak and dissipated person, 
whom she has left some years before out of 
sheer disgust. But the mere fact of his exist- 
ence becomes embarrassing when she allows 
herself to fall in love. The love-making, which 
is the substance of the story, is all very de- 
corous, and neither of the two persons chiefly 
concerned takes it with tragic seriousness. 
When the husband turns up, he is seen in his 
true light by the lover, who promptly hustles 
him off the scene before the wife has even 
spoken to him. Since she has keyed herself up 
to the point of willingness to reassume some 
sort of relations with him his abrupt departure 
serves as a curious anticlimax. Presently the 
heroine goes to America for a professional en- 
gagement, leaving her lover disconsolate, but 
not quite sufficiently so to work very deeply 
upon our sympathies. When she returns, it 
transpires that she has divorced her dissolute 
consort and married her manager. The story 
is written in a vein of grave comedy, pleasing 
but not stirring in effect. Its half-dozen chief 
characters are delicately defined, while its dic- 
tion is an acceptable compound of natural dia- 
logue, engaging description, and agreeable so- 
cial philosophy. 



* Patricia: A Mother' is the latest novel by 
'Iota' (Mrs. Caffyn). The author has made 
a notable advance in her art since the days 
of ' A Yellow Aster,' and has learned to invest 
a poignant situation with deep human inter- 
est. When Patricia's husband dies, her re- 
maining family consists of a boy and a mother- 
in-law. Of the boy she has seen little, for he 
has been kept away from her most of the 
time. Of the mother-in-law she has seen, and 
continues to see, far too much. The action of 
the story mOves about the struggle between 
mother and mother-in-law to get possession of 
the boy's affections. The deceased husband 
had been a man of contemptible character, 
wearing the mask of hypocrisy so successfully 
as to appear a true pillar of society, seen in the 
true light by his wife alone, but respected by 
the world in general, and idolized by his 
mother. His will has left the widow dependent 
upon the mother-in-law, placing the former, 
by that provision coupled with certain vile 
innuendos, in a suspicious position. The sur- 
rounding county society, which consists largely 
of cats, hounds the widow to desperation (this 
seems to be a bull, but we trust that the mean- 
ing is clear). Such is the difficult situation 
in which Patricia is placed, and from which, 
by continence of soul and persistence of pur- 
pose, she lifts herself above the reach of malice, 
gets her rightful possession of the boy's heart, 
discomfits the exasperating mother-in-law, si- 
lences the tongues of scandal, and (not least 
important in the reckoning) marries the right 
man. Her story makes a thoroughly interest- 
ing book. 

'The Gambler' has not quite the sharpness 
of interest possessed by ' The Masquerader,' 
but it again shows Mrs. Thurston to be an 
accomplished artificer of fiction, capable of 
producing a well-constructed plot and an ani- 
mated narrative. The gambler of the title is 
a woman, the daughter of a dissipated and 
impecunious Irishman, who after her father's 
death marries an amiable gentleman of some 
three times her years. This step is prompted 
by mingled sentiments of gratitude and honor, 
and the child has no idea of what it means. 
Of course there is an awakening. It comes 
when accident throws her into a pleasure-lov- 
ing set of English people in Venice, whose gay 
worldliness and easy morality fascinate the 
young wife. She is also led to discover that 
she has an innate passion for gambling, inher- 
ited from her father,^ a passion that becomes 
inordinate when once aroused. This leads to 
dangerous complications, almost to crime and 
the recklessness of despair. Before the full 
development of this tendency, however, the 
husband dies as amia,bly as he has lived, and 
the inevitable yolirig man appears upon the

scene. This is what eventually saves the hero- 
ine from herself, although only in the nick of 
time, for her indiscretions are such that she is 
on the point of drowning herself when he in- 
tervenes. The interest of this book is rather 
theatrical than real, and we could imagine it 
turned into a highly effective play.

Bbtefs ox Netv^ Books. 

To a reviewer who was privileged 
f;"i^"VameT to hear Mr. James lecture when 

he was in this country last Spring, 
there comes a special interest and delight in 
reading his two lectures in book-form, in which 
they are given the title 'The Question of our 
Speech, and The Lesson of Balzac' (Houghton). 
Listening to the even flow of sentences so com- 
plex and elusive, so solidly fraught with unique 
and weighty thoughts and mannerisms, one's 
pleasure was mixed with the constant impression 
of losing almost as much as one could cull and 
remember. To read these same thoughts, chal- 
lenging and uplifting in turn, to be able to re- 
read many of them, as often seems necessary, is 
to grasp the full purport of the messages, and to 
realize the logically balanced structure and the 
fine shadings of thought and diction which char- 
acterize Mr. James's work in criticism and in- 
terpretation. In the first essay, delivered as a 
Commencement Address at Bryn Mawr, he has 
well emphasized the overlooked needs in America 
of *a virtual consensus of educated people to im- 
part to our speech a coherent culture,' to estab- 
lish * a tone standard ' like the criterion of other 
peoples, to cultivate due regard for the vowel 
and consonant soimds that are most neglected, 
and to train our 'tonic possibilities' so that 
sweetness and ease, not cheapness, slovenliness, 
and .discord, may characterize our speech. The 
few examples cited are well chosen to illustrate 
the common looseness of tone even among edu- 
cated classes; one smiles with sympathy at his 
symbolic arraignment of newspaper headlines, in 
the journals with largest circulation, as 'affect- 
ing us like the roar of some myriad-faced mon- 
ster — as the grimaces, the shouts, shrieks and 
yells, ranging over the whole gamut of ugliness, 
irrelevance, dissonance, of a mighty maniac who 
has broken loose and who is running amuck 
through the spheres alike of sense and of sound.' 
It would seem as if the place of honor, both in 
space and title, should be given to the second 
essay in the volume, ' The Lesson of Balzac,' for 
it is a notable piece of literary criticism in its 
concentrated %'igor, its elucidation of the novel- 
ist's art, and its nicety of phrase. Recognizing 
in Balzac the master-artist of modern fiction, 
pausing only for a word now and then of effective 
comparison with George Sand, Zola, Meredith, or 
Jane Austen, the critic passes rapidly to his evi- 
dence in favor of his subject and the 'lesson' 
which he has accepted, the 'opportunity for a 
certain intensity of educative practise,' the 'con- 



crete active energy,' the fusion under Balzac's 
hand of all elements of fictional picture,— charac- 
ters, motives, and action,— and, finally, the prod- 
igality of his genius and its products. With ex- 
cellent imagery he cites the difference to his own 
mind,— that of an 'emulous fellow-worker,' — be- 
tween other novelists and Balzac: 'These are 
but glimmering lanterns, however, you will say, 
to hang in the great dusky and deserted avenue 
that leads up to the seated statue of Balzac; and 
you are so far right, I am bound to admit, as that 
I place them there, no doubt, in a great measure, 
just to render the darkness visible.' Another 
passage of allegory that will long remain in 
memory, is the delicate and keen portrayal of 
the 'atmosphere,' the time of day or season of 
the year, suggested to Mr. James's mind by the 
writings of the more familiar novelists of Eng- 
land and America (pp. 81-83). These essays 
will raise a divergence of opinion, as does all of 
Mr. James's literary work; but however widely 
readers may differ from his point of view, all 
will recognize the stimulating intellectual quality. 



A good guide The satisfaction afforded by f aith- 
to the study ful study and clear treatment of 

of Pictures. facts is the chief pleasure which 

awaits the reader of Mr. Charles H. Cafl&n 's ' How 
to Study Pictures' (Century Co.). The author 
possesses unusual qualifications for the work, and 
holds sound views as to the real nature and fvmc- 
tion of art. He traces the evolution of modern 
painting, from the Byzantine traditions which pre- 
vailed before Cimabue down to the latest possi- 
bilities introduced by the pointilliste method of 
Monet. By means of a series of comparisons of 
paintings and painters, with historical and bio- 
graphical summaries and appreciations of the 
pMiinters' motives and methods, he stimulates in- 
terest and the faculty of observation ; and he has 
endeavored to include as many as possible of the 
motives and methods which from time to time have 
prevailed, so that the student may gain a basis 
*of appreciation from which to extend his obser- 
vations with adequate understanding. He has 
followed the course of painting in different coun- 
tries, according as it flourished in them simulta- 
neously, or as it declined in one and appeared 
with vigor in another. He has shown how the 
manifestations c^f art have varied in response to 
the racial and temporary conditions of each 
country; how one impulse or movement followed 
another, all of them involving truth, but none 
monopolizing the whole truth; how 'the manifes- 
tations and possibilities of painting are wide and 
various as human nature.' While possessing a 
simplicity of method which conveys to the ave- 
rage reader a general insight into pictorial meth- 
ods and motives, the author's work is character- 
ized by elegance of style, grace of feeling, and 
elevation of thought; it will do as much good 
in the direct service of art as any treatise pub- 
lished in recent years. In fact, it might be 
studied to advantage by those to whom is en- 
trusted the noble charge of founding and man- 
aging ouv new art museums; for, as has fre- 
quently been pointed out, it is not enough that

those who manage art museums should simply 
Lave enthusiasm for art, or patriotism, or knowl- 
edge and skill in the science of general education, 
or business tact, or money,— they must also have 
a clear conception of the real nature of art, its 
legitimate aims, its capacities and incapacities, 
its relations to our daily life. 

Relations of That Mr. Bliss Carman is a poet 
Nature, Art, of high ideals for his art, yet well 
and Life. {^ touch with the main currents 
of daily life, was shown in his earlier volumes 
of essays, 'The Kinship of Nature' and 'The 
Friendship of Art.' To these he has just added a 
third, 'The Poetry of Life' (Page). That Mr. 
Carman is master of a stimulating style in verse 
and prose alike is evidenced by this sane, hope- 
ful, yet discriminating study of varied phases of 
art and life. The keynote of optimism is struck 
near the first paragraph: 'The beauty of the 
world so outreaches and overcomes all its ugli- 
ness, is so much more prevalent and vital and 
persistent.' A second pervasive thought is in 
juxtaposition,— the necessity of sincerity in life 
and in art, and the accusation that the insincere 
artist is 'morally a felon.' Much attention is 
given to the growth of industrial arts, to handi- 
craft, wMch the Japanese, he asserts, have made 
almost equal to the fine arts; and to the decad- 
ence of the artistic possibilities in the workman 
under the stress of current mercantile condi- 
tions. Some of the chapters are general in 
suggestion and elucidation,— ' The Purpose of 
Poetry,' 'How to Judge Poetry,' 'The Defense 
of Poetry,' 'The Permanence of Poetry,' etc. 
Other pages are devoted to specific reviews of the 
poetry of Browning, Swinburne, Longfellow, and 
James Whitcomb Riley. In Mr. Carman's judg- 
ment, Mr. Riley, with his 'wholesomeness, com- 
mon sense, and conservative cheerfulness, full of 
sweetest vitality and soundest merriment,' is the 
typical American poet of our day. Remonstrance 
and encouragement are well blended in the main 
by Mr. Carman. If his views on the decadencs 
of moral standards and tastes seem somewhat 
extreme, we must remember that they are shared 
by many a man of practical affairs. With the 
exception of a few extreme statements, the essays 
are inviting and rewarding to the reader. The 
trend of the volume is definite,— the endeavor to 
make art, especially poetry, contribute to the art 
of living. Everyone, argues Mr. Carman, may be- 
come an artist ' in the conduct of life, if he will 
turn his mind to it, cultivating his taste, and, 
above all, using patient care,' abjuring haste, 
fretfulness, and slovenliness of thought and 
work. 

Mohammed A volume on Mohammed, by Mr. 

as the hero D. S. Margoliouth, is the latest 

of a nation. addition to the 'Heroes of the Na- 

tions' series (Putnam). It must be admitted 
that the founder of Islam is a 'hero' mostly in 
the technical sense, to this his most recent bio- 
grapher. Composed in the strictest modem 
scientific spirit, and buttressed by a formidable 
list of authorities whose names form short verti- 
cal columns at the foot of the page, the narrative 



moves on with a calm and remorseless precision 
that strips Mohammed of whatever robes of 
romance our fancy had woven round him, and 
leaves him scarce rags enough to furnish a suit 
for Telephus. His early life in Meccah is rapidly 
sketched up to his thirty-ninth year, when he 
received his first 'revelation,' and with equal 
boldness and caution set about establishing a 
new faith of whose vast expansion he could of 
course have no conception. The familiar outlines 
of his career as Prophet are then traced. The 
famous and epoch-making Flight (which it seems 
we must spell Hijra instead of Hegira) in Sep- 
tember, 622, to Yathrib (Medinah) ; the years of 
vicissitude while God's kingdom on earth was 
being established by the very human methods of 
intimidation, plunder, and pitched battle; the 
final capture of his native Meccah; the extension 
of his power over the inhabited parts of the great 
peninsula,— all these periods are examined with 
care and candor. Full recognition is accorded to 
the genius of the organizer and leader; while his 
many foibles are exposed with a grave sarcasm 
not unworthy of Gibbon. After following with 
deepening interest Mr. Margoliouth 's philosophic 
inquiry, most readers will understand and accept 
his estimate of Mohammed as the possessor of a 
genius ' equal to the emergencies but not too great 
for them'; and as endowed, 'beneath the mask 
of the enthusiast, with the sanest and soundest 

common-sense. ' 

For all those Having appeared in many previous 
who love the volumes as a guide to practical 
outdoor world. people in the affairs of garden and 
field. Professor Bailey now appears, in a little 
volume of essays which he calls 'The Outlook to 
Nature' (Macmillan), as philosopher and friend 
to all who love the out-door world. Wholly un- 
professional and undidactic, these four essays, 
on 'The Realm of the Commonplace,' 'Country 
and City,' 'The School of the Future,' and 'Evo- 
lution,' have still both the authority and piquancy 
of expert Imowledge. They are the delightful, 
self-revealing conversation of a good teacher off 
duty. In his love of the commonplace, Mr. Bailey 
is a follower of Whitman,— a man who 'believes 
in the weather' and 'preaches the soil, the sky, 
and the people who labor.' Moreover, while his 
heart is easily toward the country, his mind is 
open toward the city. He is wise enough to see 
that 'the repose of the nature-lover and the assi- 
duous exertion of the man of affairs are comple- 
mentary, not antithetical, states of mind.' He is, 
besides, an ardent idealist even in matters of 
education; for although he exposes with pitifvd 
clearness the poverty and inefficiency of the dis- 
trict schools in which nearly half the younger 
children of the land are being under-educated, 
he believes that the schools both of city and 
country will soon come into closer contact with 
real life. 'In an agricultural community, for 
example, ' he says, ' all the farms of the neighbor- 
hood will afford training in the elements of 
failure and success. There is no reason why the 
pupils should not know why and how a man suc- 
ceeds with his orchard or dairy or factory, as 
well as to have cyclopedia information about

the names of eapes and mountains, dates, and 
the like; and whj- should not every good farmer 
explain his operations to the pupils?' The clos- 
ing chapter, on Evolution, touches the very heart 
of the author's faith in nature, and reveals the 
spirit in which he works and teaches. If there 
is nothing altogether new in the book, there is 
nothing that is not sensible, and very little that 
is not also inspiring.

Jiuton and lish life and letters would assent 
Jim times. ^q Green's characterization of 
Milton as * the ideal Puritan.' The lapse of years 
has left us in the p>oet's works the noblest inter- 
pretation of the ideals of that movement in Eng- 
land which stood for larger individualism and 
seriousness of life. Upon this conception of Mil- 
ton, Mr. Tudor Jenks has added to his volumes 
on Chaucer and Shakespeare another under the 
title, * In the Days of Milton ' (A. S. Barnes & 
do.). This book gives a vivid sense of reality to 
the stirring period from the accession of James 
I. to the death of Milton in 1674. Out of a wide 
range of reading the author has brought together 
the most significant details for graphic statement, 
and has skilfulh' interwoven the career of Mil- 
ton as a man, as a controversialist, and as a poet. 
The sturdy and reflective Puritan character is 
presented in wide contrast to that of the gay and 
pleasure-loving Cavalier. The protracted politi- 
cal and religious controversy culminating in the 
ci^-il war, the storj' of the Commonwealth, and 
the restoration of royalty, are pictured with an 
intelligent sense of their composite effect on the 
mind and work of the poet. The treatment of 
Milton throughout the narrative is sympathetic. 
The author is luminous rather than critical, gives 
a touch of imagination to the accuracy of facts, 
and inspires with fresh human interest a national 
movement commonly thought of as only bitter 
and austere.

Recent startling events in Russia 
Darke'sVB^'sia. l^^d unexpected timeliness to the 

work of Konni Zilliacus on 'The 
Russian Revolutionary Movement' (Button). The 
book was written with the special object of en- 
lightening public opinion in Finland upon the 
history of the revolutionary movement in Russia; 
and it has been translated for Anglo-Saxon read- 
ers by the authority and at the request of the 
author. The Finnish Grand Duchy has been loyal 
to the Tsar because the Tsars have been loyal 
to their pledge to maintain the political rights 
of the Finns: and that people have been largely 
ignorant of the repressive and cruel policy car- 
ried out in the rest of the Russian Empire. But 
after ninety years of peaceful relations, the fool- 
ish advisors of the present Tsar persuaded him, 
in the interest of the autocratic principle, to ex- 
tend that system over Finland; and he weakly 
consented to violate his solemn promise and the 
promises of his predecessors, and took away from 
the Finns their cherished political rights and at- 
tempted to annihilate their nationality. The gal- 
lant struggle that the Finns have made, to which 
recent events give promise of success, is known 
to all the world. Since no outside eountrv could 



be looked to for help in this struggle, the lead- 
ers turned to the men and parties within the em- 
pire that were carrying on a s imil ar struggle for 
political rights. The book gives an account of 
the patriotic efforts that have led to thousands 
of martyrdoms and to the cruelties that have at- 
tended the government policy of repression. The 
story of the long protracted struggle is told with 
self-control, with fairness, and with effect. After 
a brief statement of the origins of the revolu- 
tionarj' movement in the attempts of Peter the 
Great and Catherine IE. to Europeanize Russia, 
and from the mingling of the Russian armies 
with those of Western Europe in the campaigns 
against Najwleon, the author proceeds to give a 
detailed account of the growth of the movement 
under each ruler since that time. Though the ac- 
count is that of an avowed opponent of the gov- 
ernment, the author carries the reader with him 
by his evident desire to keep to the facts of his- 
tory, and by his freedom from denunciation and 
bitterness. The account is of absorbing interest, 
and may well be read by all who desire to obtain 
an inside view of the underlying causes of present 
conditions in Russia. The developments from 
day to day, astounding as they are, accord well 
with the prophecies of this author.

(Harper & Brothers) is first of a series of small 
volumes on the 'Heroes of American History'; 
but whether the lives of other heroes are to be 
prepared by Mr. Ober, or by other writers, does 
not appear. There are, furthermore, some 'in- 
ternal evidences,' as a 'higher critic' might say, 
that Mr. Ober's book is written for the entertain- 
ment of youthful readers. Readable it certainly 
is, to one who is not fastidious regarding the his- 
torical accuracy of the book he is reading. And 
the author makes it clear that he finds little jus- 
tification for the most important acts of his hero. 
But as an account of the economic conditions 
which existed in Mexico at the time of the raid 
of Cortes, of the Aztecs, and of their 'civiliza- 
tion, ' it is an exaggerated following of the ultra- 
Romantic School of American historians. And 
it suggests the question, whether or not an ac- 
curate account of the conditions prevailing in 
Tenochtitlan in the early part of the sixteenth 
century, and of the subversion of the Aztecs by 
the Spanish freebooters at that time, could not 
be made as entertaining to minds, either youthful 
or mature, as the fanciful accounts usuaUy given

of 'The Conquest of Mexico.'

field work, and the development of plates, the 
author devotes separate chapters to the problems 
of ornithology, zoology, entomology, and botany. 
The photographs with which the book is illus- 
trated are as cosmopolitan as the camera itself, 
for such exquisite touches of nature make the 
whole world kin. It is scarcely gracious to choose 
among such beauties ; but perhaps the most admir- 
able is that of a bedewed spider's web, in which 
not only each strand, but nearly every dew-drop, 
is distinctly perfect. Possibly some readers will 
suffer 'zero at the bone' because of the pictures 
of snakes; if so, they can turn the pages until 
orchids and moths and anemones restore them. 
The author passes over with a few modest words 
the thought that such advanced photography will 
soon revolutionize text-books and affect all scien- 
tific study. But the reader gladly pauses to won- 
der whither such possibilities will lead. If an 
album of beautiful pictures can be made for the 
study of each tree, and if the life-history of each 
insect, even to the instant when the chrysalis 
opens to free the butterfly, can be presented to 
the eye in permanent form, our knowledge of the 
world about us will soon grow to delightful inti- 
macy. 

The name of G. Lowes Dickinson 
is not so familiar to American as to 
English readers, who associate it 
closely with the ' New Paganism ' of which Wal- 
ter Pater was the prophet. Mr. Dickinson is one 
of the most earnest preachers of Hellenism, and 
the charm of his style adds a pleasing force to 
his arguments. 'A Modern Symposium' (Mc- 
Clure, Phillips & Co.) is the latest work from his 
pen. It purports to be an account of a meeting 
of philosophers representing all the various po- 
litical and social systems of the world. The 
Conservative, the Radical, the Socialist, the An- 
archist, the Scientist, the Poet, and many more, 
each pleads his own cause. The closing speaker, 
noted simply as a man of letters, distinctly rep- 
resents Mr. Dickinson's theories of life, and at- 
tempts to sum up all the virtues of all the other 
systems. * A Modern Symposium ' is a little book, 
and while it scarcely answers to the original 
festive and merry significance of the Greek title, 
it will afford a pleasant hour's reading.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



To the 'Standard English Classics' of Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. there are now added Thackeray's 
'Henry Esmond', edited by Mrs. Hamilton Byron 
Moore; 'Burke's Speech on American Taxation', 
edited by Professor James Hugh Moffatt; and 
'England in 1885', being a chapter of Macaulay's 
'History', edited by Professor Arlo Bates. 

The Kinkodo Publishing Company, Toyko, has 
issued a very interesting sketch of the career of 
Admiral Togo by Professor Arthur Lloyd, M.A., 
of the Imperial University. It is not merely a 
biography of the 'Nelson of Japan,' but also a 
description of the stirring events in which he par- 
ticipated and a philosophical treatment of the his- 
tory and politics of those events. It is well worth 
a careful reading. 



Mr. Malcolm Townsend's ' U. S. Curious Facts ' 
has been born again as a ' Handbook of United 
States Political History for Readers and Students,' 
and is published by the Lothrop, L»ee & Shepard 
Co. It is one of the most useful of reference 
books for teacher and student alike, and the 
amount of out-of-the-way information which it coV 
lects and classifies is simply amazing. 

'The American Jewish Year Book' for 5666, ed- 
ited by Dr. Cyrus Adler and Miss Henrietta Szold, 
has just come to us from the Jewish Publication 
Society of America. This is the seventh annual 
issue of the work, and its regular appearance is 
henceforth assured. The special feature of the 
present issue is a sort of 'who's who' compilation 
of biographical sketches of Jewish communal work- 
ers in the United States. The review of the past 
year, by Mr. Max L. Margolis, is a record of melan- 
choly interest. 

'One Hundred Best American Poems,' selected 
by Mr. John R. Howard, and ' Selections from the 
Writings of Benjamin Franklin,' edited by Mr. U. 
Waldo Cutler, are two new volumes in the ' Handy 
Volume Classics' of the Messrs. Crowell. The- 
same publishers, in their ' What Is Worth While ' 
series of booklets, send us ' Books in Their Sea- 
sons,' by Mrs. Annie Russell Marble; ' Faith and 
Life,' by Dr. Charles E. Jefferson; ' The Beauty of. 
Kindness,' by Dr. J. R. Miller; and 'Is Life Worth. 
Living,' by Mr. Frederick Lynch. 

Mr. Walter L. Sheldon of the St. Louis Ethical 
Society, has published a little book on ' The Divine 
Comedy of Dante.' The author declares himself 
' a teacher in ethics ' rather than a ' Dante Schol- 
ar,' and describes the four lectures that make up 
his book as ' intended especially for those who 
have never read the poem but would like to know 
something about it.' These guide-posts of warning 
are set up in plain view so that the book is not 
likely to find its way to the wrong audience. The" 
class of people for whom it is written may read it 
with both interest and profit. Mr. S. Burns Wes- 
ton, Philadelphia, is the publisher. 

President Roosevelt has recently gone out of his 
way (if such a thing be possible) to recommend 
the poems of Mr. Edward Arlington Robinson, and 
a new edition of ' The Children of the Night ' 
(Scribners) is the natural consequence. Lovers of 
poetry have known the book well enough these 
many years, and it is now likely to reach the eyes 
of many of the merely curious whether they love 
poetry or not. This time the presidential lightning 
has struck in the right place, for Mr. Robinson's 
work has' never got half the attention it deserved. 
This volume includes ' The Torrent ' and ' The 
Night Before,' which poems gave a title to the 
author's first public venture. 

To those who had the privilege of listening to 
the Sunday discourses of the Rev. David Swing, 
the ' poet preacher ' of Chicago, and who learned 
to appreciate his eloquent and stimulating utter- 
ances, it would seem a pity that words of such 
power and beauty should not be preserved beyond 
their author's death. Some of them have, indeed, 
found their way into little books of essays 
or sermons' published during his life; but these 
will not preclude, rather they make the more in- 
viting, the volume of selections from his hitherto- 
unpublished writings, prepared with care and taste 
by Miss Sophie B. Kimball. Beauty, spirituality, 
the value of high ideals in life and thought, fill 
these inspiring pages. The volume is attractively 
printed, and is to be had of Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
& Co.

Notes. 



'The Life That Counts,' by Mr. Samuel Valentine 
Cole, is a volume of pleasant moralizing — half ser- 
mon and half essay — published by the Messrs. Crow- 
ell. 

Ben Jonson's 'The Devil Is an Ass,' edited by 
Dr. William Savage Johnson, adds another volume 
to the set of Jonson's plays which is rapidly taking 
shape among the 'Yale Studies in English.' Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers. 

An authoritative account of the ' civic renas- 
cence ' in America has been prepared by Professor 
Charles Zueblin, and will be issued at once by the 
University of Chicago Press in a volume entitlecf 
* A Decade of Civic Development.' 

For their well-known ' American Statesmen ' 
series Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have in 
active preparation volumes on Sherman, Grant, and 
McKinley, written by Messrs. Theodore E. Burton, 
Samuel W. McCall, and T. C. Dawson, respectively. 

A work on ' Primary Facts in Keligious 
Thought,' by Dr. Alfred W. Wishart, and a new 
edition, revised and illustrated, of Professor Charles 
J. Chamberlain's ' Methods in Plant Histology ' 
will be published at once by the University of 
Chicago Press. 

Professor Frank Heywood Hodder has edited for 
the Arthur H. Clark Co. a reprint of Captain Philip 
Pittman's ' Present State of the European Settle- 
ments on the Mississippi,' first published in London 
in 1770. This is the earliest account of the Mis- 
sissippi settlements, and is a work of much value 
to students of early Western history. The same 
publishing firm has also in preparation a reprint of 
Elias Pym Fordham's ' Personal Narrative of 
Travels in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
Indiana, Kentucky; and of a Residence in the 
Illinois Territory. 1817-1818,' to be edited by Mr. 
Frederic Austin Ogg. 

Announcement is mude of the organization of a 
national publication committee in the field of 
practical philanthropy and social advance. Its first 
work has been to merge the two periodicals,* Char- 
ities ' of New York, and ' The Commons ' of 
Chicago, and beginning with this month they will 
appear as a combined weekly publication. From 
its inception ' Charities ' has stood for progress 
in organized effort for bettering social conditions. 
' The Commons ' has been a spirited exponent of 
the settlement movement. Their editors, Mr. Ed- 
ward T. Devine and Professor Graham Taylor, will 
be associated in the editorship of the joint under- 
taking. This combining of two such strong forces 
will doubtless result in largely increased effective- 
ness in a work which should have the support of 
all right-thinking Americans. 

In connection with their forthcoming new edition 
of George Eliot's 'Romola,' edited and illustrated 
from the historical standpoint bj' the distinguished 
Italian scholar Dr. Guide Biagi, Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. have just received the following 
note from the editor: ' I have found the original 
cards of all the books studied by George Eliot 
here in the National Library for -" Romola." 
These books, with their ancient views of Florence, 
gave to her the first idea of the scenery of the 
novel. I have reproduced the cards, signed by 
Lewes, studying with her.' These new discoveries 
should prove a feature of much interest in this 
new edition of a favorite classic. The work is 
to be issued in two volumes, uniform with Mrs. 
McMahan's successful ' Florence in the Poetry of 
the Brownings' and ' With Shelley in Italy.'

THE WORKS OF LUCIAN OF SAMOSATA 

Complete with exceptions specified in the preface. Translated by H. W. Fowlee and F. G. Fowleb. 

Extra foolscap 8vo, 4 vols., S4.00. 

". . . The work of the translators might be original, so far as its ease and vivacity are coneemed ; the reader 
forgets that he is reading dialogues and essays written seventeen hundred years ago. . . . For Lucian is as modem as 
Horace ; his essay on the art of writing history might have come out in any recent review, and is entirely applicable 
to-day. The sneers at the persons who hurry into historical writing might have been written after reading a list 
of books on the Spanish war by the heroes who took part in it — vicariously and otherwise. His dialogues of the 
gods, of the dead, of the hetairse, are the models for dialogues of to-day, in style, wit, and ' smartness.' ... A work 
of high art, for which its authors are to be th^iked." — New York Times, Oct. 21, 1905. 

"... This edition of one of the most modem of the ancients is a veritable boon, and we give it a hearty wel-

LIVES OF GREAT WRITERS 
By TUDOR JENKS. With an Introduction by HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE 

IN THE DAYS OF CHAUCER 

Tudor Jenks brings the personality and the times of the great writers directly to ua. To read after him is to walk the streets and mix with the 
living people of Old England. He has made the merry-hearted England of Chaucer's time live in our imagination. 

IN THE DAYS OF SHAKESPEARE 

He creates again our Shakespeare for us — Will Shakespeare, the boy in Stratford, the young man who went to seek his fortune in London, and 
later returned to the life of a country gentleman, a sportsman, and a neighbor. 

IN THE DAYS OF MILTON 

The England of Milton is the England from which America drew its life, and Mr. Jenks has pictured Milton the affectionate friend, the blind 
seer, the lonely prophet of a great new world.

FOUR BEAUTIFUL BOOKS 



WITH SHELLEY IN ITALY, in her delightful Browning -Florence 
volume, published last year, Mrs. McMahan showed her thorough familiarity 
with Italy and her appreciation of poetic atmosphere. This new volume is quite 
the equal of the other in these charming qualities. The romantic character of 
Shelley's life, especially in Italy, and the pictorial beauty of the background which 
provided his inspiration, supply unequalled material for an illustrated book of 
this kind. Mrs. McMahan's idea has been to show the poems actually in the 
making by grouping with them letters, illustrations, and passages from note- 
books. The result is a volume of notable interest and exceptional beauty, with 
over sixty illustrations from photographs. It is hardly necessary to say that 
Mrs. McMahan's admirable "Florence in the Poetry of the Brownings" is 
quite as acceptable this season as last. It proved extremely popular as a gift- 
book, the limited edition especially being generally pronounced the most beauti- 
ful Holiday volume of the season. Each, $1.40 net. 

The Large Paper Editions of both these volumes meet all the require- 
ments of an exquisite gift-book. The text is printed on Italian hand-made 
paper, and the illustrations in photogravure ink on Japan paper. Bound in gray 
paper sides, with an embossed fleur-de-lis in gold, and vellum back. Price, 
each, $3.75 net; the same in full vellum $5.00 net; the same bound in Florence, 
full parchment, antique style, Florentine hand-illumination, $10.00 net. 

A GARDEN IN PINK. The gift-book of all others to send to the young 
people who live in the suburbs and go through the hopes and fears of the annual 
garden making. This absorbing subject forms the basis of a delightful narrative, 
half practical and half whimsical, written in a highly entertaining fashion by 
Blanche Elizabeth Wade. As to appearance, nothing more charming at moderate 
price will be found among the Holiday books. Every other page has a floral 
panel or an illustration by Lucy Fitch Perkins, printed in tints, and there are 
beautiful scenes from unusual photographs. Boxed, $1.75 net. 

LIFE OF OMAR KHAYYAM. A fascinating life of the poet astronomer 
by J. K. M. Shirazi, a Persian scholar who also comes from " the land of enchanted 
rose-gardens." He tells Omar's life in a charming manner, and while presenting 
some entirely new facts, which are of great interest to the student of Omarian 
literature, his easy style readily holds the attention. The book is produced in a 
unique manner, the title page, cover, chapter headings, and initials being richly 
printed in gold and color, representing hand-illumination in the Persian style. 
All lovers of the famous quatrains should possess this volume. $1.50 net; 
15 copies on large paper, $5.oo'net.

IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS 



HOME LIFE IN FRANCE. No more interesting and delightful picture 
of the French people has ever been published than is given in this volume by 
Miss Betham-Edwards. The "Chicago Tribune" says, "It is full of such 
information as one likes to get at first hand respecting such matters as social 
usages, housekeeping, the baby, the girl, domestic help, the country doctor and 
so on. One might read a dozen histories of France and not get so real and 
intimate an acquaintance with the people as from a book like this." With many 
illustrations. $2.50 net. 

IN THE LAND OF THE STRENUOUS LIFE. The Abbe Klein's 

altogether entertaining volume will be an acceptable addition to any library. 
" He is," says "The Dial," "a man of fine culture, and a wide-awake observer. 
Best of all, his whole book breathes a freshness and a joy of living that, quite 
apart from its subject matter, are decidedly engaging. The already established 
popularity of the work in France is indicated by the fact that it passed into a 
seventh edition a few months after its publication, and it has received from the 
French Academy the Montyon prize. The good literary style of the English 
version, made by the Abbe himself, and the highly entertaining character of the 
narrative, will no doubt make it a favorite in this country also." With 14 full- 
page illustrations. $2.00 net. 

HISTORIC ILLINOIS. Mr. Randall Parrish in this impressive volume offers 
a most fascinating and vivid narrative. He does not attempt to claim that his 
book is an exhaustive history of Illinois; it has been his aim rather to present 
historical facts which, for their own sake, are to every American patriot as fasci- 
nating as romance. No State in the Union surpasses Illinois in the romantic 
incidents of the early days. The book is written in Mr. Parrish's most char-

THEODORE THOMAS. The "Autobiography" of the great musician, 
published soon after his death last Spring, should be in the possession of every 
music lover, and every American who takes pride in national achievement. It is 
the story of a career carried to a successful close through the most discouraging 
obstacles, and as a contribution to our musical history it stands absolutely alone. 
The first volume contains the "Autobiography," further chapters by Mr. George 
P. Upton, and many other pertinent matters. The second volume is given over 
entirely to programs and constitutes a record of unequalled value. With many 
portraits and illustrations. $6.00 net.

NOVELS THAT SUCCEED 



A SWORD OF THE OLD FRONTIER. The best romance yet 
written by Randall Parrish, who is a master story-teller, and who has proved it 
in " My Lady of the North" (ninth edition) and " When Wilderness Was King'* 
(seventh edition). "If this doesn't pass its predecessors in popularity," says 
Mr. Sage, in the "Cleveland Leader" "I miss my guess." He is not likely to, as 
the first edition of 25,000 copies is already four-fifths gone. The plot concerns 
the adventures of a French officer during Pontiac's Conspiracy. The illustrations 
are from four splendid paintings by Mr. F. C. Yohn. $1.50. 

BEN BLAIR : PLAINSMAN. " Probably one of the best novels we shall 
get this year," according to the " Brooklyn Eagle." This is an Eastern paper, 
but out in the West, where they know what makes a story of ranch life true 
and real, they go further. " The strongest Western book of years," says the 
" Leader," of Great Falls, Montana, " the novel of the season." Again, in the 
conservative East, the "New York Globe" claims that "Jack London in full 
fury cannot make your heart beat faster than this new writer." Naturally it is 
especially a story for men. Fourth Edition. $1.50. 

FOR THE WHITE CHRIST. This romance of the days of Charle- 
magne has been universally pronounced the most beautiful book of fiction of 
1905. Certainly no recent novel has received so decorative a treatment as 
Mr. Bennet's splendid story, with its characteristic borders in tint on each page, 
the illustrations reproducing perfectly the rich coloring of the Kinneys' paintings 
. in oil, and perfection in every detail of manufacture that makes a beautiful book. 
$1.50. 

THE FLOWER OF DESTINY. Just as " For the White Christ " is dig- 
nified and splendid in its appearance, this book is dainty and exquisite in its 
artistic treatment, suggesting the emblematic violet which gives it its name. 
Mr. Orcutt's love story of Napoleon and Eugenie is without doubt one of the 
most attractive offerings of the season as a gift book, with few superiors even at 
a higher price. $1.25. 

MY LADY OF THE NORTH. For a year now this splendid romance 
of Mr. Parrish's has had a steady sale. Nine Large Editions have been made, 
and it has become one of the permanent successes of recent fiction. The hero is 
a Confederate officer, and the Memphis "Commercial Appeal" says, "Jt is 
perhaps the best romance of the war that has been written." Considering the 
naturally critical attitude of the South toward Civil War stories by Northern 
writers, this is praise indeed. $1.50.

This book, which is written and published with the approval and assistance of Mrs. Fitzherbert's decendants, and contains materials now 
published for the first time by special permission of H. M. the King, places the fact of her marriage with the Prince of Wales, afterwards 
George IV., beyond doubt. The large number of unpublished papers and letters of great interest give considerable importance to the

"... These volume titles of themselves suggest a work of 
philosophical conception, and if it be executed with the breadth, 
penetration and clearness of expression that mark the first install- 
ment, it will assuredly attain a high standard. The results of 
investigation are handled with a narrative skill that invests the 
driest of facts with the interest of freshness ; the tone throughout 
is scrupulously impartial and the requirements of perspective are 
unfailingly observed." — The Outlook.

STARVECROW FARM. A Novel 

By Stanley J. Weyman, Author of "A Gentleman of France," " Under the Red Robe," etc. With 8 illustrations. 

Crown 8vo. $1.50. 
The scene of " Starvecrow Farm " is laid in the rural England of the rugged, homely North. The time — a few years after the Battle of 
Waterloo. It is the story of an elopement with unusual consequences, for the girl marries not the man with whom she elopes, but the 
one from whom she flees. As in the case of former novels of Mr. Weyman's, the reader's sympathies pass from one character to the 
other during the telling of the tale. 

"... Mr. Weyman has used his narrative gift to good purpose in this book, and has also shown all his old skill in the delineation, if 
not in the creation, of character." — New York Tribune. 

"... fully worthy of Mr. Weyman's reputation as the foremost writer of romantic fiction. His creation ... of the unctuous 
Mrs. Gilson, sharp of tongue and warm of heart, shows his art at its ripest." — Boston Herald.

lover in his enjoyment of the achievements of a beautiful 
life.

With Special Reference to Christmas Purchases 




Really, if books should be wiped out of ex- 
istence, would not Christmas have to be given 
up ? For books, for countless thousands, young 
and old, are the ideal gift, satisfying equally 
pride and taste and sentiment. And never has 
choice been so wide or so delightful as now. 



the tenderly humorous "Sandy," with "Mrs. 
Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch " and " Lovey Mary. " 



Especially happy se- 
lections for the friend who 
has traveled are Edith 
Wharton's "Italian Villas 
and Their Gardens " and 
James Eugene Farmer's 
"Versailles and the Court 
Under Louis XIV." Most 
of the fifty illustrations that 
beautify "Italian Gar- 
dens" are reproduced in 
the colors of the original, 
paintings by Maxfield Par- 
rish. Exquisite in make- 
up, too, is this new record 
of Versailles, bound in rich 
blue cloth, with seventy 
illustrations in tint. And 
for the stay-at-home friend 
these are books to open up 
wonderful new worlds. A book less pretentious 
in form but rich in meat is Charles H. Caffin's 
"How to Study Pictures," just what the title 
would indicate. The friend who loves pictures 
could have no more acceptable gift. 



Yes, do send 
me a book. . . 
Not a bargain 
book, bought 
from a haber- 
dasher, but a 
V beautiful book, 
a book to caress — 
peculiar, distinc- 
tive, individual : a 
book that hath first 
caught your eye and 
then pleased your 
fancy, written by an 
author with a ten- 
der whim, all right 
out of his heart. We 
will read it together 
in the gloaming, and 
when the gathering 
dusk doth blur the 
page, we '11 sit with 
hearts too full for 
speech and think it 
over. 

Dorothy Wordsworth 
in a letter to Coleridge. 



Is THERE some one to be remembered to 
whom a book of fiction would most appeal? 
The rich and unusual humor of " The Fugitive 
Blacksmith " commends it strongly. Give it to 
any man, and find how hard a time he has to 
snatch his own reading from the importunities 
of family and friends. " Plain Mary Smith" is 
full of riotous fun ; "Jules of the Great Heart " 
is fresh and strong ; and then there is Dr. S. 
Weir Mitchell's powerful story, " Constance 
Trescot,"a book which physicians and lawyers 
find of peculiar interest. Other novels of the 
day include "The Northerner," "Under Rock- 
ing Skies," "Sabina" (by the author of "Tillie"), 
' ' The Wheat Princess " (by the author of ' ' When 
Patty Went to College"), and " Zal," Rupert 
Hughes's international romance. And there are 
the ever-welcome books by Alice Hegan Rice, 



Of a beauty and value out of all proportion 
to their cost are the delightful little Thumbnails, 
tiny gems of thought and artistic form. The 
new issues are a compilation of George Wash- 
ington's state papers under the title of "Wash- 
ington," Charles Dickens's "The Chimes," and 
Mrs. Browning's " Sonnets 
from the Portuguese " ; but 
there are twenty-seven 
others to make choice from, 
among them "Poor Rich- 
ard's Almanack," "The 
Rubaiyat," Marcus Au- 
relius, etc. 



Books are the 
food of youth, 
the delight of 
old age; the or- 
. nament of pros- 
perity, the ref- 
' uge and com- 
fort of adversity ; a 
delight at home, 
and no hindrance 
abroad ; companions 
by night, in travel- 
ing, in the country. 
— Cicero. 



For the man who has 
not Theodore Roosevelt's 
books there could be no 
more admirable Christmas remembrance. "The 
Strenuous Life" and "Hero Tales from Amer- 
ican History" come in rich, dignified dress, while 
"Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail" has ninety- 
four illustrations by Frederic Remington. 



Would you make an addition to home or 
friend's library of enduring value, what better 
than a standard biography ? Andrew D. White's 
Autobiography is perhaps 
the most notable biograph- 
ical work of the year ; and 
young and old find it in- 
spiring and delightful read- 
ing. Consider also the 
short life of Lincoln, con- 
densed by John G. Nicolay 
from the great ten-volume history of Nicolay and 
Hay. And the "Autobiography of Joseph 
Jefferson " will recall many delightful evenings 
spent under the sway of the master-comedian of 
the American stage. 



Of gifts, there 
seems none 
more becoming 
to offer a friend 
than a beauti- 
■ ful book. — A mos 
Branson A Icott's 
" Concord Days." 



Would you know more of these and scores 
of other books ? An exceedingly attractive cata- 
log, printed in color, with full details, may be 
had for the asking. It has in it a classified list 
of books for children from six to ten, from ten 
to fourteen, etc. A postal-card request to The 
Century Co., Union Square, New York City, will 
bring it by return mail.

"A perfect took about Charles Lamb, his sister and his friends. . . Might have been 
written by a contemporary of Lamb's so far as its vivid reality is concerned. ... A biog-

Louis XIV. and La Grande Mademoiselle By arvede barine 

Authorized English Version. 8vo, illustrated. Net, $3.00 {by mail, $3.25). 
" It is bewildering to think of the many crowns and coronets that might have rested on the 
brow of this dramatic heroine, a heroine who appears and disappears in clouds of dust, with 
regiments of cavalry wheeling and whirling around her to the sound of the trumpets — 
the stern devotee of reason who dismissed one of her maids because she married for 
love, the philosopher who debated in her mimic court whether an accepted lover is more 
unhappy than a rejected lover in the absence of the beloved." — London Times.

The quality, the discernment and balance, intuitive grasp of essentials, the grace, force,

it would be better to say, have given him a place alone in the history of critical literature.

Dr. Bielschowsky was acknowledged as the foremost authority on Goethe, and it is 
generally conceded that this is the most important life of Goethe, from the standpoint of 
scholarship, sympathetic interpretation, and literary art — in fact, the most important 
biography of any man written in German for many years. 

Kate Qreenaway By m. h. spielmann aud g. s. layard 

Large 8vo, with 53 full-page colored and 125 other illustrations. Net, $6.50. 
Those who think of Kate Greenway merely as the designer of pretty pictures for children 
will be surprised to learn what an interesting and important personage she was. Mr. 
Spielmann shows that among the best artists and critics of Europe, Miss Greenaway is 
regarded as one of the artist geniuses of the Nineteenth Century. This book is some- 
thing more than a personal biography. It is rather a peep behind the scenes, led by Kate 
Greenaway, into the intimate converse of the foremost artists and writers of om* times.

By OPIE READ. The Great Tragedy and Triumph of Calvary. The wonderful adventures of the 
centurion who placed the crown of thorns on the Saviour's brow. This great epoch in the world's history delicately

the early Britons, the Franks, and in Palestine, including a vivid picture of life among the Druids, a princess of this 
race, named VIoden, being the heroine. The cold, hopeless philosophy of the Romans and the revivifying faith 
of the gentle Nazarene permeate the narrative, holding the reader's attention with a peculiar fascination. As the 
exciting course of events is followed, the blood is made to stir and the heart to beat with a strange quickening, 
subsiding only to the peaceful influence of the rejected "King of the Jews," so skillfully and delicately depicted 
by the author. Herod, Pilate, Nicodemus, Barabbas, and Joseph of Arimathea hold the reader's attention with a 
peculiar interest. Large 12mo, silk cloth, 6 full-page halftones, 2 exquisite colorgraphs, 333 pages. $1.50.

General Sociology 

An Exposition of the Main Development in Sociological 
Theory, from Spencer to Ratzenhofer. 

By ALBION W. SMALL 

Professor and Head of the department of Sociology in the 
University of Chicago. 

I N this important book Professor Small brings his wide reading and 
* keen anaUytical powers to bear on the history of sociology and its 
present claims to be regarded as a science. These claims have often 
been disputed, on the ground that the material of sociology has already 
been pre-empted by the recognized social sciences — ethnology, history, 
economics, etc. Professor Small's answer is that the work of co-ordi- 
nating these various groups, of surveying the process of human associa- 
tion as a whole, is a task distinct from that of a worker in one of the 
special fields, and that the body of knowledge so gained legitimately 
ranks as a science. In other words, sociology is to social science in 
general what neurology is to medicine. It is addressed to historians- 
economists, political scientists, psychologists, and moralists, quite as 
much as to sociologists.

A Decade of Civic Development 




By CHARLES ZUEBLIN 

Professor of Sociology in the University of Chicago. 

Author of American Municipal Progress. 

Formerly President of American League for Civic Improvement. 

A VIGOROUS optimist is in himself a hopeful sign of the times. The 
■'* author of this volume is a man of this stamp. " The last decade," 
he says, "has witnessed not only a greater development of civic improve- 
ment than any former decade, but a more marked advance than all the 
previous history of the United States can show." Professor Zueblin is 
a practical man, and his book is a practical book. It gives a concise 
and spirited account of certain definite measures ( political, economic, 
social, and artistic) for the betterment of American cities. Here is a 
subject that lies at our very doors, a subject that no citizen can afford 
to overlook. 

Beginning with a discussion of the revived interest in citizenship, 
he treats in turn the training of the citizen, the making of the city, the 
educational effect of the great world's fairs, and the recent improve- 
ments in the cities where most has been done — Boston, New York, 
Harrisburg, and Washington.

in International Politics. 

A FEW REPRESENTATIVE OPINIONS 



From the London Times : "Almost every possible variety of tropi- 
cal government has presented itself to Mr. Ireland, and upon 
all he has brought to bear the keen insight of an experienced 
observer, rejecting the non-essential for the vital, and enrich- 
ing his survey with a great fund of comparative information." 



From H. H. Sir CHARLES BROOKE, G.C.M.G., Raja of Sarawak : 
" I feel no hesitation in saying that the Reports will be found very 

valuable to anyone who takes an interest in distant foreign 

governments, of which Mr. Ireland has reported clearly and 

justly." 

From Pres. J. G. SCHURMAN, Cornell University : 
" Your book will meet a real need in our literature. Your Tropical 
Colonization is a guarantee of your qualifications." 

From Pres. WOODROW WILSON, Princeton University : 

" I know how interesting and important Mr. Ireland's Report on 

Colonial Administration is likely to be, and I will take pleasure 

in recommending it to our librarian." 

As only a limited edition of THE IRELAND REPORT will be printed, it is desirable that all who wish 
to secure a set should register their subscriptions at once. 



Boston Herald.— In an editorial referring to the chapters on the 
Philippine Islands in Mr. Leland's latest book : " They give the 
moat intelligent and instructive condensed review of the course 
of our government in those islands that has yet come from any 
source, and it is certain to command the attention of the peo- 
ple in an extraordinary degree. The author has long been 
recognized as a thorough and dispassionate student of the 
general problem of Colonial government on its administrative 
and economic side."

Important Holiday Announcements 



FOR THE LIBRARY 



With Walt Whitman 
in Camden 

A Diary Record of Conversations kept by HORACE 
TR AUBEL, with many important letters, docaments, 
portraits, etc. The publication of this volame is cer-. 
tainly one of the most important events in the literary 
history of America. For several years the author, 
one of Whitman's literary executors, recorded faith- 
fully the conversations and events of his almost daUy 
meetings with the poet. The result is a picture of 
the daily life and thought of Walt Whitman such as 
we possess of no other great author, possibly except- 
ing Dr. Johnson. Of the many letters and manu- 
scripts very few have ever been published, and they 
are from many of the greatest of Whitman's contem- 
poraries who are discussed most familiarly. Sump- 
tuously illustrated Net, $3.00; by post, $8.25.

bridge. The New York Mail says of this book : "It is 
a refreshing thing to read a book written by a man 
who knows his subject through and through. We do 
not believe the social student will find a dull page in 
the book. It presents the very spirit and essence of 
poetry, music and art of the French Revolutionary 
movement ; the whole quivering world of modem 
radical Paris is here." The principles of human 
nature disclosed are universal and its interpretations 
full of suggestion to those who would understand the 
trend of radical thought in our own country. Sump-

BOOKS AND SHOES. 

There is so much of practical wisdom in Mr. 
Henry Holt's paper on ' The Commercialization 
of Literature/ upon which some comments were 
made in our last issue, that we are inclined to 
turn to it again for a text, in order to say some- 
thing more upon the vexed question of advertis- 
ing. The methods to which some publishers 
have resorted of recent years seem to be so con- 
spicuously lacking in good sense, and so injuri- 
ous to the best interests both of publishing and 
of literature, that nothing could be more timely 
than the protest to which Mr. Holt has given so 
emphatic and authoritative an expression. 

Do the principles that apply to the advertis- 
ing of shoes apply also to the advertising of 
books? This is a question that would hardly 
seem to need discussion were it not for the 
obvious fact that books have come of late to be 
advertised in just that fashion — by the full- 
page display in the daily newspaper, by the 
circus poster, by the flaring street-car sign, and 
by the perambulating sandwich-man. It is 
amazing that any person in his right mind 
should think such methods likely to promote 
sales in a measure at all proportional to the 
outlay. For one book that will benefit by this 
vulgar sort of appeal there must be a score, or a 
hundred, that will lose, and the publisher who 
resorts to it is at best taking a gambling chance 
of the most reckless sort. One of them, when 
questioned directly, is quoted as replying: 'No, 
1 shan't get the money back directly, but it will 
give authors a great idea of my enterprise, and 
I may get one or two big ones to pay for it.' 
'Now the shores of bookland are fairly strewn 
with the wrecks of publishing craft that have 
been fitted out and launched with a view to 
giving the public a great idea of their enter- 
prise, and the skippers, no doubt, such of them 
as have survived, are wishing that they had 
thought more of seaworthiness and less of show. 

* There is the advertising that appeals to the 
eye,' says Mr. Holt, ' and the advertising that 
appeals to the intelligence.' The former kind 
of advertising is effective with products that 
everyone is likely to use, such as patent medi- 
cines, food stuffs, and articles of clothing. It 
' shapes popular habit,' independently of deliber- 
ation : ' everybody has eyes, and everybody uses 
food and shoes ; so this kind of advertising may 
take root anywhere, and it pays to scatter it.' 
How different the problem becomes when books 
are in question is obvious at the first glance. 
Most of the people who buy shoes do not buy 



THE DIAL, 



[Dec. 1, 



books at all, while of those who are occasional 
purchasers of books, few spend as much upon 
them as they do upon shoes. Nor will *the 
advertising that appeals to habit' have much 
influence over these few; the habit of buying a 
particular kind of shoe may be fixed by the 
reiterated appeal of the advertiser to the eye, 
but we cannot imagine such an effect in the case 
of a particular book. Who ever acquired the 
habit of buying copies of 'Trilby/ or *Eben 
Holden/ or ' The Crisis ' year after year ? 

The essential difference between the two cases 
is, of course, that a man may continue to buy 
and wear out shoes for a lifetime, while it takes 
but a single copy of a book to supply forever 
his individual demand for it. This fact should 
be well within the grasp of a child in the kinder- 
garten stage of development, yet we frequently 
witness the effort of some publishers to advertise 
a book as if he were aiming to create for it a 
permanent class of customers. ' It takes longer 
than most books live to advertise into a paying 
reputation even a shoe or. a soap,' but the 
expenditure may justify itself in the long run; 
a book, on the other hand, cannot hold its mar- 
ket for any length of time, and its advertiser 
must get back his outlay at once, or charge it 
to his profit and loss account. For soon the book 
which he has sought to advertise into fame has 
become but a book of yesteryear, and finds no 
one to bestow a thought upon it. 

We suppose that there is, roughly speaking, 
in any community, at any given time, a 'book 
fund,' just as there is a ' shoe fund,' or, pace 
the newer economists, a ' wages fund.' Each 
new book seeks to get as large a share of that 
fund for itself as it may, and to some extent, 
no doubt, the persistent flaunting of a particular 
title in the eyes of the public will divert in that 
direction a certain number of dollars whose 
course is not absolutely predestined by the taste 
and intelligence of their possessors. But for 
each dollar that is thus captured by advertising 
of the random and vulgar sort, two are likely 
to be spent in the effort, and that game is surely 
not worth the candle. As for the book buyer 
who applies taste and intelligence to his pur- 
chases, we may be sure that he will not be lured 
by any of the devices of puffery, but will hold 
in just suspicion the sensational methods of 
broadside and poster advertising, and ask only 
to be informed, with reasonable distinctness of 
exposition, through the medium of the accred- 
ited organs of bookish intelligence, concerning 
the present and forthcoming output of litera- 
ture. It cannot be too often asserted that a 
book is an individual thing, and that a person 
who wants it, if he have any intelligent reason 
whatever for his desire, will not accept another 
book as a satisfactory substitute. This also 



seems to be a sufficiently elementary proposition, 
yet failure to recognize its truth has worked 
much mischief, in witness whereof may be 
adduced not only the economic waste of reckless 
advertising now under consideration, but also 
the standing disgrace of our national import 
duty upon English books. 

The craze for book advertising of the undis- 
criminating sort has probably passed its culmin- 
ation. It was encouraged a few years ago by the 
appearance of a number of phenomenal 'sellers ' 
of the poorer grade of fiction. Two or three 
singularly worthless books were boosted above 
the six-figure mark by patent medicine methods 
of exploitation, and the spectacle made many 
publishers lose their heads. Fortunately, there 
have been no 'sellers' for a year or two past, 
and there are indications of an awakening to 
soberness in the publishing business. Two 
effects of the reign of the ' seller ' are pointed 
out by Mr. Holt. One is that bookselling has 
fallen largely into the hands of the department 
stores, since ' any " saleslady " can identify and 
sell a " seller " as well as the most accomplished 
bibliopole ' ; the other is that ' the mad quest of 
the golden " seller "... reacts to crush 
out ' the sale of all other books. Now if there 
are any two tendencies that are likely to prove 
ruinous in the long run to the business of 
publishing, they are precisely these two that 
have been operative of late. Book stores must 
be preserved and strengthened if publishing is 
to continue to bear its old relation to popular 
culture, if it is even to exist in continued secur- 
ity and dignity. And the books that never can 
become ' sellers ' must not be slighted because 
their modest sales make so poor a showing beside 
the dazzling success of some book that popular 
caprice has brought into an ephemeral vogue. 
He is a short-sighted publisher indeed who does 
not do his best to oppose the inroads of the 
department store upon the business of book- 
selling, and who does not realize that the lasting 
strength of his own position must depend almost 
absolutely upon his control, not of an occasional 
' seller ' to be forgotten the year after publica- 
tion, but of a long list of books of the kind that 
keep on selling to a moderate extent year after 
vear. 



THE EVOLUTION OF ' MOTHER OOOSE.' 



' Mother Goose ' is the starting-point from 
which mankind begins its knowledge of books. 
The novelist whose latest volume is in its hun- 
dreds of thousands, and whose name is in the 
mouths of the multitude, gained his first notion 
of fiction on his mother's knee from the some- 
what highly colored story of the old woman who 
swept the cobwebs out of the sky ; the poet's first 



1905.]

pastoral was ' Little Bo Peep/ his first tragedy 
* Ding Dong Bell/ These nursery rhymes have 
trained the ear and stirred the imagination of 
generations of children, and are worthy of adult 
consideration not only because of their venerable 
antiquity but also because of their peculiar fas- 
cination for the child mind. 

As for Mother Groose the author, we must con- 
sign her to the realm of myths ; for she appears 
to be even less substantial than Homer. Some 
forty years ago, an ingenious gentleman of Bos- 
ton claimed to have identified her as Mistress 
Elizabeth Goose, or Vergoose, who flourished in 
that city between the years 1712 and 1720; and 
this effort to give her a local habitation was at 
once accepted with joy by a large part of that 
reading public which expects of its authors 
concrete physical existence. The Vergoose 
story stated that our nursery laureate was the 
mother-in-law of one Thomas Fleet, a printer; 
that she lived with his family over his shop in 
Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street) ; that 
she habitually repeated nursery rhymes and 
songs for the delectation of Fleet's children, and 
that said verses became so popular in Pudding 
Lane that Fleet, thinking to turn an honest 
penny, published them in 1719 under the now 
famous title, ' Mother Groose's Melodies.' The 
story was uncontradicted for years, but at last 
the higher critics got hold of it and exploded it. 

If we are to seek the genesis of ' Mother 
Goose,' we must go farther than Boston and 
earlier than 1719. Mr. Andrew Lang has dis- 
covered in Loret's ' La Muse Historique,' pub- 
lished in France in 1650, the following verses: 

Mais le Cher motif de leur Joye, 
Comme un conte de la MSre Dye, 
Se Trouvant fabuleux et faux, 
lis devlendront tous blen p^nauts. 

The second line isthe significant one: 'Lake a 
Mother Goose story,' which, in the next line, is 
shown to be ' fabuleux et faux.' Clearly, then. 
Mother Goose was known to the French more 
than two hundred years ago, as the typical teller 
of extraordinary and fanciful tales. 

The earliest date at which Mother Goose 
appears as the author of children's stories is 
1697, when Charles Perrault, a distinguished 
French litterateur, published in Paris a little 
book of tales which he had during that and the 
preceding year contributed to a magazine known 
as the * Eecueil,' printed at The Hague. This 
lx>ok is entitled ' Histoire ou Contes du Tems 
Passe, avec des Moralites,' and has a frontispiece 
in which is pictured an old woman telling stories 
to a family group by the fireside, while in the 
background are the words in large characters, 
' Contes de ma IMere I'Oye ' — 'Tales of my 
Mother Goose.' These tales were eight in num- 
ber, consisting of the following : ' Little Red 



Eiding Hood,' 'The Sisters who dropped from 
their Mouths Diamonds and Toads,' 'Blue- 
beard,' ' The Sleeping Beauty,' ' Puss in Boots,' 
' Cinderella.' ' Eiquet with the Tuft,' and * Tom 
Thumb' — or 'Little Thumb' (Petit Poucet) 
as he is here called. ' Eiquet with the Tuft ' is 
the only one of the collection which seems not 
to have maintained its popularity in. English and 
American collections. 

It is thus clear that Mother Goose was of 
French extraction and of at least respectable 
antiquity. But thus far nothing has been heard 
of her ' Melodies.' She began her existence as 
the raconteur of fairy tales, not as the nursery 
poetess. 

The idea of collecting well-known rhymes for 
children and of attributing them to this fabulous 
story-teller seems to have originated with John 
^sTewbery, the London publisher, who has been 
justly styled the father of children's literature 
in England ; and it is more than probable that 
Oliver Goldsmith edited the first collection. This 
book, which was entitled ' Mother Goose's Mel- 
ody,' appeared not much later than 1760. "We 
know that Goldsmith did hack-work for New- 
bery during five or six years at about this period, 
that he wrote the child's story of ' Goody Two 
Shoes,' which Newbery published in 1765, and 
that he was interested in children's literature. 
Certain earmarks, too, are to be found in the 
preface to the 'Melody,' which suggest his 
authorship. Probably no original copy of the 
Newbery 'Mother Goose' is now in existence, 
but the book was reprinted by Isaiah Thomas of 
Worcester, Mass., about 1785, and several copies 
of the Worcester edition are preserved, one of 
which has been photographed and reproduced in 
facsimile by Mr. W. H. Whitmore of Boston. 
Other publishers also reprinted the Newbery col- 
lection. John Marshall, of Aldermary Church- 
yard, Bow Lane, London, brought out an edition 
in which he followed Kewbery almost verbatim, 
making only a few changes in the arrangement 
of the selections. A copy of the Marshall edition, 
is still extant in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. 

In 1797 a quaint satirical booklet was printed 
in London entitled 'Infant Institutes.' This 
seems to have been an essay on nursery litera- 
ture, written in a mock-scholarly style, with 
comments on a number of jingles then evidently 
current, — intended probably as a burlesque upon 
the work of the Shakespearean commentators of 
that day. The ' Infant Institutes ' contained a 
number of nursery rh}Tnes, some of which had 
not been printed in 'Mother Goose,' but we 
hear of no other general collection until 1810. 
In this year appeared ' Gammer Gurton's Gar- 
land, or The Nursery Parnassus,' edited by 
Joseph Eitson, an eminent scholar, critic, and

antiquary, who gave much attention to the 
origin and development of English ballad 
poetry. ' Gammer Gurton ' was evidently put out 
as a rival of * Mother Goose.' The name was a 
familiar one, found originally in the old comedy, 

* Gammer Gurton's Needle,' but used as a type 
of the ancient grandmother. This alliterative 
' Garland ' contained nearly all of * Mother 
Goose's Melody,' and about as much more ma- 
terial of the same sort, collected by Eitson from 
all available sources. Gammer Gurton's reign, 
however, was short, and it is to a Boston pub- 
lisher that we look for the final establishment 
of Mother Goose as the autocrat of the nursery. 
At some time between 1824 and 1827, Munroe 
and Francis, a firm of Boston booksellers doing 
business at what is now the corner of Washing- 
ton and Water streets, published a book called 

* Mother Goose's Quarto, or Melodies Complete,' 
and in 1833 their successors, C. S. Francis & 
Co., brought out a much larger book, the title 
page of which reads ' Mother Goose's Melodies : 
The only Pure Edition.' Though this is adver- 
tised as ' pure Mother Goose,' and though it con- 
tains all but three of the original rhymes of 
Newbery's edition, there is a plentiful alloy of 
' Gammer Gurton,' and of other rhymes which 
had escaped both authorities. In fact, * Gammer 
Gurton ' is at this point absorbed and loses her 
identity in ' Mother Goose.' The Munroe and 
Francis edition has recently been reprinted in 
facsimile, with an introduction by Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale. 

The last notable addition to nursery litera- 
ture was made in 1842, when Halliwell, the well- 
known British scholar and Shakespearean critic, 
published 'The Nursery Rhymes of England,' 
which his title announced were ' collected prin- 
cipally from oral tradition,' but which contained 
nearly all of ' Mother Goose,' ' Gammer Gurton,' 
and the American Consolidated Mother Goose, 
besides much new material which the collector 
might well have allowed to remain oral tradi- 
tion. It is the most complete collection of nurs- 
ery rhymes ever published, and is interesting 
to the student of folk-lore, though not altogether 
profitable to the child. Much of it is coarse, a 
great deal of it is silly, and, unfortunately, the 
coarsest and silliest of it has been published ad 
nauseam in modern editions, to the lasting 
shame and humiliation of the mythical dame 
to whom it is now all attributed. 

The fact is worthy of note that among col- 
lectors and editors of nursery rhymes are to be 
found the brightest of scholars and litterateurs, 
— Goldsmith, Eitson, and Halliwell ; Andrew 
Lang, who edited in 1884 perhaps the best chil- 
dren's collection of jingles now obtainable; Mr. 
Charles Eliot Norton, who made the collection 
contained in Book I. of the ' Heart of Oak 



Series' ; Professor Saintsbury, editor of the Eng- 
lish volume, ' National Ehymes of the Nursery ' ; 
and Mr. Charles Welsh, one of the best authori- 
ties on children's literature in this country to- 
day. 

Thus far we have traced simply the printed 
existence of these rhymes, — the bibliographical 
history of them. But when we go back of all 
that and attempt to discuss when and where and 
how they first came into being, we open a wide 
field of exploration, — as wide as the world it- 
self, and as old as history. Take for example 
' The House that Jack Built.' This originated, 
unquestionably, in an old accumulative bit of 
verse found in the Chaldee and also in the 
Hebrew. The rhymes, ' Hush-a-bye baby upon 
the tree top ' (originally ' Sing, lullaby baby,' 
etc. ) and ' Eock-a-bye baby thy cradle is green,' 
both suggest a pastoral out-of-door life, and are 
of great antiquity. The first is quoted in a song 
called '^The London Medley,' printed in 1744. 
The same song also contains ' Old Obadiah sings 
Ave Maria,' and ' There was an old woman sold 
puddings and pies.' ' Old King Cole ' was an 
historical character, who ruled the Britons in 
the third century A. D. ; Eobert of Gloucester 
says he was the father of St. Helena, and hence 
the grandfather of Constantine. 

' Jack and Jill ' is drawn from Icelandic 
mythology. The two children were supposed to 
have been stolen and taken up into the moon, 
where they still stand with the pail of water 
between them; and the Scandinavian peasant 
will point them out to you on a clear night 
when the moon is at the full, as we point out to 
our children ' the man in the moon.' A myth 
almost identical with this is found in the San- 
skrit. The first line of ' Sing a song of sixpence ' 
is quoted in Beaumont and Fletcher's ' Bon- 
duoa ' (about 1615) . ' A duck and a drake and 
a half penny cake ' appears in Junius's ' No- 
menclator,' London, 1585. ' When a twister, a 
twisting will twist him in a twist ' is in Dr. Wal- 
lis's ' Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae, Oxon. 
1G74.' ' Three Blind Mice ' is in a book called 
the ' Deuteromelia,' published in London in 
1609 with music accompanying. ' Handy- 
dandy, Jack-a-dandy ' is a rhyme the repeating 
of which was part of an old game — centuries 
old ; it is referred to in ' Piers Ploughman ' 
(1369). 

Many of the popular nursery rhymes are his- 
torical. Several of these have already been 
referred to. 

' Over the water and over the sea 
And over the water to Charley,' 

was an old Jacobite song, sung many a time in 
Scotland at midnight meetings in the alehouses 
while waiting for ' Bonnie Prince Charley.' 
' Charley loves good ale and wine ' was another 



1906.]

drinking-song of the same period, — some say 
a part of the same song, though that is doubt- 
ful. It also refers to the Young Pretender. 
Eeferences to these historical rh}Tnes might 
be multiplied indefinitely. There is * Please to 
remember the Fifth of November,' referring to 
the gunpowder plot; there is the 'black man 
upon the black horse/ who was Charles the 
First ; there is ' Hector Protector, dressed all 
in green ' ; there is ' The Parliament Soldiers ' 
who are said to have *gone to the King.' 
Then there is the rhyme * London Bridge is 
falling do^-n.' which celebrates an event in the 
early part of the eleventh century, when King 
Olaf, the Norseman, went to England and 
broke down London Bridge after a battle with 
King Ethelred. The victorv' found a place in 
the Norse sagas, and the following lines from 
the ' Heimskringla ' evidently formed the basis 
of the nursery rh}'me: 

* London Bridge Is broken down, 

Gold is won and bright renown ; 

Shields resounding, 

"War horns sounding, 

Hildur shouting in the din. 

Arrows singing. 

Mail coats ringing, 

Odin makes our Olaf win.' 

As one looks back over the history of these 
old rh\Tnes, he is filled with wonder at their 
vitality. Century after century has passed over 
them, and they still find a place in every nur- 
sery — a c-omer in the heart of every child. 
Many verses for children have been written in 
modem times which to the adult mind seem 
more melodious and attractive, but the child 
looks upon them with more or less of coldness. 
They may amuse him for a time, but after all 
it is his ' Mother Groose ' that he takes to bed 
with him. He knows nothing of its antiquity 
or of its history. He does not know why he 
likes it, — he simply likes it. 

A story is told of the daughter of Horace 
Mann, who during the tender years of baby- 
hood was studiously kept away from the cor- 
rupting influence of all nursen,' nonsense, and 
brought up in an eminently proper intellectual 
environment. When she had become quite a 
large girl, she heard one day, for the first time, 
* High-diddle-diddle,' and was so fascinated by 
it that she begged to have it repeated to her 
until she could learn it. This story proves not 
only the futility of keeping children in a strait- 
jacket, but also the inherent attraction of 
Mother Goose, aside from all possibilities of as- 
sociation or training. 

What is the secret of this ever-fresh and ever- 
enduring popularity? Some thoughtful per- 
sons have claimed to find in the old rhymes hints 
of profound philosophy, which they think is 
the preservative principle that has kept them 
through the centuries. Mrs. Whitney, in her 



deliciously extravagant * Mother Groose for 
Grown Folks,' has found them fairly bristling 
with morals. She sees in ' Little Boy Blue ' an 
exhortation to youth to shake off indolence and 
apply himself to duty; 'Little Jack Horner' 
she conceives to be a satire on the egotism of the 
successful man ; ' Little Bo Peep ' offers com- 
fort to the disappointed ; ' Solomon Grundy ' 
is the epitome of life — a simpler and more di- 
rect form of Shakespeare's ' Seven Ages." The 
Old Woman who 'lived upon nothing but victuals 
and drink ' shows the longing of the tmsatisfied 
soul after things spiritual ; ' Jack Sprat and his 
Wife' illustrates the complementary character 
of human endowments, each being fitted to its 
place in the economy of nature. It is perhaps 
true that Mrs. Whitney's corollaries are drawn 
more in jest than in earnest, but other com- 
mentators have made a ridiculously serious 
matter of it. We must remember that the pop- 
ularity of ' Mother Goose ' springs from the 
child himself, — and what child has any vital 
concern as to the lesson in 'Little Boy Blue'? 
If he suspected a lesson in it, he would straight- 
way lose interest. 

Neither is it the wit or humor that appeals 
to the child. Professor Saintsbury tells of an 
acquaintance who used to be mightily amused at 
the line, ' Hotum, potum, paradise tantum, peri- 
meri-dictum, domine,' in which he said the 
phrase, ' Paradise tantum ' {only paradise) 
was the nicest thing he knew. It is probable 
that whoever first evolved this choice pig-Latin 
had no thought of doing a particularly nice 
thing, but perhaps wanted to burlesque some old 
Latin formula used by the priests. At aU 
events, the child sees nothing witty in it, — the 
jingle is what attracts him. 

The child takes little thought as to what any 
of these verses mean. There are perhaps four 
elements in them that appeal to him, — first, the 
jingle, and with it that peculiar cadence which 
modern writers of children's poetry strive in 
vain to imitate; second, the nonsense, with just 
enough of sense in it to connect the nonsense 
with the child's thinkable world ; third, the ac- 
tion, — for the stories are quite dramatic in 
their way ; and fourth, the quaintness. Many of 
the objects which are referred to are entirely 
uninteresting to him in themselves, — many of 
them entirely strange and beyond his horizon; 
and perhaps this quality of mystery also adds 
to them a certain charm. No child knows ex- 
actly what it was that Little Miss Muffet sat on, 
and it is an interesting experiment to get from 
a dozen average children their ideas on this sub- 
ject. The conceptions range aU the way from 
a rocking-chair to a mushroom; and I have 
observed that the artists who illustrate ' Mother 
Goose ' are as far apart in their views as the

children. What does interest the child is the 
rhyme and the swing of the metre. ' Spider ' and 
'beside her' fall on his ear quite pleasantly. 
Then he has a vague feeling of sympathy or of 
contemptuous pity for the heroine, conditioned 
upon his own relations with spiders in general. 
I remember, in my childhood, passing through 
both the sympathetic and contemptuous stages, 
— the first, a quite delightful sort of terror 
which made me half fear to hear the story ; the 
second, a complacent pleasure which grew out 
of the consciousness of weakness overcome. 

What was it that so attracted Horace Mann's 
daughter in ' High-diddle-diddle ' ? First, un- 
doubtedly, the metre, which is a waltz move- 
ment, suggesting all the abandon of the un- 
usual scene which it celebrates, — this empha- 
sized by the alliteration in the first two lines, 
like the beat of some barbaric tom-tom. There 
is, too, an excellent set of rhymes, except in the 
emasculated modern version which substitutes 
* sport ' for the good old English word ' craft,' — 
meaning skill, strength, and courage, — and 
thereby destroys the verse and the idea as well. 
Then, there is the very intoxication of move- 
ment; everyone is doing something. And 
finally, there is the absolute nonsense of it all. 
I do not wonder that the verse has lasted three 
hundred years or so, — and it is good for at 
least three hundred more, unless children grow 
too wise to love absurdities and too proper to 
feel the swing of a half-savage melody. 

Many good people have tried to improve 
' Mother Goose.' A familiar story is that of the 
Quaker who revised ' High-diddle-diddle ' for 
his little Mary, making the cow to jump under 
the moon, the little dog to larh rather than 
laugh, and the cat to run after the spoon — the 
dish being debarred from such action on ac- 
count of the manifest impossibility of running 
without legs. It is not recorded how little Mary 
received the emendations, but it may be in- 
ferred that she did not highly approve of them. 
Every attempt to alter ' Mother Goose ' for 
the better has resulted in failure. To try to 
make her sensible is to destroy a chief element 
of her charm. To modernize her is to lose that 
quaint flavor of things half understood and 
wholly unusual, which appeals to every child. 
To expurgate her and try to make of her a 
moral teacher is to relegate her to the dust-bin. 
Some things there are in the old editions which 
are coarse to modern ears, and judicious editors 
wisely omit them ; but on the whole there is lit- 
tle danger that the rising generation will have 
its morals or its taste debased by this old clas- 
sic. To trifle with ' Mother Goose ' is like 
trifling with Shakespeare. We have no men or 
women living nowadays who can improve upon 
her. Walter Taylor Field.

The Brookfield Memoirs.* 

In what Tennyson called the 'dawn-golden 
time' at Cambridge, there flourished a famous 
company of gifted youths, the cream of whom, 
we know as the ' Apostles,' who almost without 
exception wrote poetry, of more or less merit; 
and of this choice coterie William Henry Brook- 
field was not the least illustrious member. It is 
worth noting, before going further, that his 
birth-year was 1809, and that he of course knew 
Edward FitzGerald, with whom he travelled in 
France in 1839, besides being intimate with 
Thackeray, Spedding, Arthur and Harry Hal- 
lam, Lord Lyttelton (at one time his pupil and 
long afterward his biographer), Monckton 
Milnes, Trench, Maurice, Venables, Frank Lush- 
ington, Charles Buller, the Tennysons, the Car- 
lyles, the Ashburtons, and numerous other not- 
ables of the early and middle Victorian era. Of 
the ' set ' with whom he and his beautiful wife 
consorted after his settlement as a London 
curate in the early forties, we read in the fifth 
chapter of ' Mrs. Brookfield and her Circle,* 
now offered to the public in two attractive, well 
illustrated volumes: 

'The record of their doings on any given day or 
week was then practically a history of every other 
one; for the actions of the "Set," as Thackeray 
called a privileged few, became quite charmingly 
simple directly any members of it found themselves 
in the neighborhood of the others. A close, con- 
stant, pleasant intimacy would inevitably ensue and 
continue until the hour when some of them, forced 
away by sterner duties, were found to fly ' ' the 
festive scene." "Festive" describes almost ac- 
curately most of that wonderful companionship; 
they had no wearyings whatever in one another's 
society, they extemporized banquets, they strolled 
in and out of each other's dwellings, they assem- 
bled the most brilliant of people on the shortest 
of notices; they struck their wits together and al- 
ways emitted sparks; they took keen and often 
critical interest in each other's life and work, and 
when they parted set forth stimulated to other and 
finer achievements, which in many cases were in 
due time brought forth to the joy and enrichment 
of the world.' 

The Brookfield memoirs, which have been so 
tastefully compiled by a son, Mr. Charles Brook- 
field, and his wife, might somewhat better have 
been called ' The Brookfields and their Circle,' 
or even ' William Henry Brookfield and his 
Circle ' ; for Brookfield himself was the last man 
to be known simply or chiefly as the husband of 
his wife. Not only was he twelve years older 
than she, but his must appear to the reader as 
by far the more striking and pronounced per-

sonality. He is best remembered for his orator- 
ical, mimetic, and humorous powers. Kinglake, 
as quoted by our authors, said of him, ' As an 
orator of original genius, he possessed marvel- 
lous histrionic skill, which he was able to mod- 
erate in the pulpit ' ; and '' in the reading of 
Shakespeare he was never in his time surpassed 
by any one ' — although his time included such 
Shakespearean readers as Charles Kemble and 
his daughter Fanny. Of Brookfield as a hum- 
orist Dr. Thompson, Master of Trinity College, 
Cambridge, said that he had seen ' a whole audi- 
ence at one of these displays stretched upon their 
backs by inextinguishable laughter.' Concerning 
his family it will here suffice to say that he was 
the son of a Sheffield solicitor of some note, and 
that 'he was one of a large family, most of 
whom possessed wit of a superior quality, though 
brought up in an atmosphere of Puritanism that 
was perhaps strict and rigid even for those 
days.' 

Mrs. Brookfield (Jane Octavia Elton) was 
the eighth and youngest daughter of Charles 
Elton of Clevedon Court, afterward seventh bar- 
onet of that name. Her mother was one of * the 
beautiful Miss Smiths' so often mentioned in 
the memoirs of the period, and she was herself 
noted for unusual comeliness and charm, as well 
as for her quick intelligence, her graceful wit, 
and her keen sense of humor. Her father's 
sister Julia was the wife of Hallam the histor- 
ian, which of course made Arthur and Harry 
Hallam her cousins. And now, having suffi- 
ciently introduced our chief characters, let us 
permit them to speak for themselves, from the 
copious letters and journals of which the book 
is largely composed. Here is a characteristic 
passage from a love letter, written in London to 
' dearest Jane ' under the paternal roof in South- 
ampton : 

'I amuse myself with thinking how delightfully 
jealous you will be all this evening while I am 
dining with Mrs. D., my old flirt!!! Yes — I 
shall be there — most likely sit next her — say 
very, very pretty things to her. Seriously I think 
you will be rather uncomfortable! And thou shalt 
^now liotc sharper than a maggot's tooth it is to 
have a faithless love! You know she is really very 
pretty and "lights up" like a lustre — and has 
such winning ways! Ah, Jenny, sweet child — they 
must have loveliness indeed to win the eye even 
from your outward and poorest loveliness — and 
winning ways they must possess that could charm 
one's heart into forgetting your fond confiding 
affectionate nature — I never see any slightest ap- 
proach to you in head or heart; and I feel it a 
sort of wrong to you to commend your beauty 
when praises so much more honorable are your 
due. I fear when my letters come to be printed 
in a breach of promise ease I shall be thought a 
great fool.' 

Like many another engaged couple, "William 
and Jane were forced to let the consummation 
of their happiness wait on the smiles of dame 



Fortune. Their love letters written during these 
pre-matrimonial years are in some respects un- 
usual, if not unique. On one side we find the 
queerest medley of fun and affection, humorous 
scolding and ardent devotion, paternal counsel 
and brotherly comradeship, familiarity (which 
ocasionally is most strangely permitted to border 
on coarseness) and the fantastic ebullitions of 
high spirits and a rollicking humor; on the 
other, the ingenuous trust of an unspoiled child 
and the boundless love of a warm-hearted 
woman, the merry jests of a quick-witted girl 
and the tender anxiety of a young person solici- 
tous to form herself in all respects to please her 
lover. Varied and sometimes amusing are that 
lovers modes of addressing his sweetheart, as, 
' my darling child,' ' sweetest lady,' ' my dear 
girl,' ' dearest Jenny,' * sweet junk,' ' my dearest 
Glum,' ' dearest Jane,' and, after marriage, ' my 
dearest Desdemona,' ' my dearest person,' ' Jean 
Octavia Eelton,' 'young Miss,' und dergleichen 
mehr. 

Breakfasts at Eogers's, dinners at Hallam's, 
and soirees innumerable elsewhere, brought the 
Brookfields into familiar relations with all the 
best London society of their time. Of the good 
stories told at Eogers's table and at other 
hospitable boards, including their own, we find 
many quotable examples, as witness the follow- 
ing, whose immediate source is one of Brook- 
field's letters: 

'The new Bishop of Xew Zealand, in a farewell 
and pathetic interview with his mother, after his 
appointment, was thus addressed by her in such 
sequence as sobs and tears would permit: "1 sup- 
pose they will eat you, my dear — I try to think 
otherwise, but I suppose they will. Well! — we 
must leave it in the hands of Provideuce. But 
if thev do — mind, my dear, and disagree with 
them. '' ' 

Among other amusing amiabilities and whimsi- 
calities of this circle of friends was the playful 
habit they had of signing their letters with one 
another's names, or with some fantastic pseudo- 
nym chosen on the spur of the moment, while a 
similar spirit of innocent foolery made them 
spell phonetically, head their notes ' St You and 
St Mee,' address ifrs. Brookfield as the ' Coun- 
tess of St. Luke's,' or as ' the Eev. Mrs. Brook- 
field.' Harr\' Hallam would sometimes closely 
copy Thackeray's handwriting (they called him 
' Thack ') and then apologize for ' this base im- 
itation of the Great Humourist.' In a frolicsome 
letter to his mother, Brookfield excuses some 
absurd spelling by explaining, ' I've got such a 
c-old id by dose I caddot write the letters eb ad 
ed/ But enough of these pranks — or enough as 
soon as we have given the following scene, laid 
no matter where, time midnight and after. We 
copy from a letter to 'my dearest Desdemona,' 
the writer of it too apparent to need naming:

[Dec. 1, 



'By about 12 most had gone. We had had Meri- 
vale, Blakesley, Stanley (who wrote Arnold's life), 
Signer Conaro of Venice, Mansfield, Gray, Frank 
iLuBhingtoD, Harry, -Self, Veuables and others. 
Only five remained when I proposed reading part 
of a play, each one taking the part that came 
successively, reading in a ring — so that, for in- 
stance, I began — next party that spoke would be 
Harry — next Lushington, &c., straight away 
round and round so that one man in his time 
played many parts. The absurdity of this 1 cannot 
describe — we laughted into fits — but the re- 
markable thing is the gravity of these youngsters 
when there is need of it. Thus Harry would be 
reading Polonius, Laertes, or Ophelia with the 
most shameless attempts at propriety, while we were 
all splitting around — and he was equally con- 
vulsed when others than himself were reading. At 
length we were obliged to give it up. At 3 we 
retired. ' 

Turning now from such frivolity, let us take 
a peep at Brookfield dining with the Carlyles on 
Christmas day of 1852, Mrs. Brookfield being in 
attendance on her sick father. From the hus- 
band's diary we clip the following fragment: 

' Carlyle now and then put a bit of what he 
thought one ought to like — of leg, of loin, or of 
fat, on one's plate with a sort of genial, homely 
hospitality which was touching. There was won- 
derful nut-brown from the neighbouring * ' Crick- 
eters," Port and Sherry, to which Madam presently 
added a bottle of excellent Madeira. Meanwhile, 
the talk was incessant but remarkable for nothing 
but cheeriness. Then came woodcocks, and finally 
a Christmas plum pudding with brandy sauce — 
which brought on my story of the Saddleworth 
elector at York in Montague Wilson's contest 
about 25 years ago. At one of the open Taverns 
he called to the waiter: "Waiter! ha' ye nowt 
better nor woin?" "No, sir, nothing better than 
champagne, port, sherry, whisky, gin, brandy, etc." 
"Way then! bring us a quart of that stuff we 
hed we't puddin. " Carlyle laughed like a vol- 
cano at this — and twisted it many ways in the 
course of the evening. After dinner and wine C. 
and I adjourned upstairs for a pipe of York Kiver 
Tobacco — over which he talked characteris- 
tically, chiefly about Education. Then downstairs 
to cheerful tea — and so made end at ten o 'clock, 
and I went home in an omnibus with the silent 
cousin who had dined with us, bearing with me 
half a dozen old pipes of C. 's, and the one he 
had used that evening for a memorial of a day 
that I felt very grateful for and not a little elated 
by.' 

And now a long leap to the end of the book 
and the death of Brookfield at the early age of 
sixty-five — not sixty-three, as the types have put 
it. His last words were to his wife, ' Good-bye, 
dear Jane, and God bless you !' Beyond being 
made honorary chaplain, and later chaplain-in- 
ordinary, to the Queen, and inspector of schools, 
a post which he held for seventeen years, he had 
enjoyed little official recognition of his talents. 
In literature he lives to us, in a modest way, as 
the Eev. Frank Whitestock in Thackeray's 
sketch, ' The Curate's Walk,' and also in his 
friend Lyttelton's brief memoir of him, in which 
are printed eulogistic letters from illustrious 
friends and a sonnet by Tennyson. Mrs. Brook- 



field survived her husband by twenty years. 
' Had she been inclined to change her state and 
move in a higher and more exclusive sphere,' 
write her biographers, ' she had several oppor- 
tunities for re-marrying, but her love for her 
children made her consider them, and she con- 
cluded to devote the rest of her life to them. 
She did not as a widow remain in retirement,' 
but continued to enliven the company of her old 
friends, and graciously welcomed the new, 
' always surprised and pleased that she was still 
sought out and noticed.' Some of Thackeray's 
letters to, Mrs. Brookfield are already familiar 
from having appeared both in a prominent 
magazine and afterward in book form. She is 
said to have been the original of Lady Castle- 
wood in ' Henry Esmond.' Her own novels, 
' Only George,' ' Influence,' and ' Not a Heroine,' 
will be remembered by some readers; and those 
who knew her in life will recall her rare gift 
as a viva voce story-teller, as well as her refined, 
dignified and delicately sympathetic bearing 
toward all classes, even the humblest. 

The many portraits in this work deserve es- 
pecial mention, some because they are unfamil- 
iar, others because they are admirably engraved,

mitted, even for a few hours, to the bright and

counts his gifts complete without some new 
tale of outdoor life. This year there is satisfac- 
tion for all who love such stories — and in this 
count we all enroll ourselves as children; for 
each of the best-known writers in this field has 
given us a new book as good as his best, and 
several new writers have brought their offerings. 

Among these books none vrill be more justiy 
popular than Mr. Thompson Seton's ' Animsd 
Heroes.' ' A hero is an individual of unusual 
gifts and achievements. Whether it be man or 
animal this definition applies.' And Carlyle 
himself would scarcely deny a meed of hero- 
worship to the eight * individuals ' whom the 
book celebrates. The fact that most of them 
belong to the common tribes rather enhances the 
appreciation of their qualities. Even the Slum 
Cat, it seems, is worthy to enter the class of 
animals Mr. Seton has known, and though her 
heroism may not have exactly the same fibre 
as that of the Sandhill Stag, it is nevertheless 
genuine and admirable. The author's power 
has increased as his style has become more sim- 
ple and his allegiance to plain facts more indis- 
putable. He has never told a story more dra- 
matically than that of Little War-horse, the 
Jack Babbit, or more touchingly than that of 
Arnaux, the Homing Pigeon. As if to prove, 
too. that his greater command of the common- 
place has not lessened the wealth of his imagin- 
ation, he closes his volume with the 'Legend 
of the White Reindeer,' a haunting storv in 
which plain fact runs off confessedlv and most 
alluringly into pure fancy. With regard to the 
illustrations, one might suggest that here and 
there they are too sketchy and uncertain to add 
either the humor or the' illumination that the 
author intends. But this suggestion is only a 
marginal note. 

In Mr. Long's * Xorthem Trails ' the stories 
are less tense and dramatic, partly because the 
author is so sensitive to the world in which the 
dumb creatures move — ' his soul, like a wind- 
touched harp, thrilling to the melodv of woods 
and waters ' — that he never quite detaches his 
drama from the background. For this reason 
his stories have a charm and an excellence of 
their own. There is a peculiar fascination about 
these northern trails, not only because in fol- 
lowing them one finds himself 'face to face 
with new animals — white wolf, fishes, salmon, 
wild goose, polar bear, and a score of others big 
and little ' — but because the far-north country 
which they traverse, 'the land of space and 
silence,' has an unfamiliar and mysterious 
beauty. The consciousness of this beauty is in 
each of these new stories, softening and human- 
izing the effect of them. Yet the stories are 
well told for their own sake, too, and most of 
their details stand clearlv in the reader's mem- 



or}-. If choice were to be made where each is 
good, perhaps the preference would fall upon 
' The Quest of Waptonk,' the tale of a wild 
goose whose valiant defence of mate and gos- 
lings wins the intruder s whole-hearted admira- 
tion. 

In contrast to the collections of shorter stories, 
it is pleasant to come upon a well-developed 
biography such as Mr. Eoberts has written of 
' Eed Fox.' No fear that so eventful a life-his- 
tory will furnish any dull reading, even when 
told at length! This ruddy hero is possessed 
of unusual strength and cunning, though it 
must be admitted he has no more idea of honor 
among thieves than his less talented kinsmen. 
His ' calculations ' about avoiding traps, stalk- 
ing partridges, leading dogs over rotten bridges 
that will not hold them, and escaping detection 
by riding in a farmer's wagon, may seem a trifle 
incredible. But he is a fine fellow, who deserves 
to come off victor in his struggle for life, and 
every child who reads about him will be glad 
that the story turns out well. 

A comparatively new writer, Mr. Edwin C. 
Litsey, publishes several short stories, some of 
them reprinted from * Leslie's Magazine,' under 
the title ' The Eace of the Swift.' The stories 
have marked individuality, though the subjects 
of them — a fox, a hawk, a coon, etc., — have 
been treated very often before. Each tale moves 
rapidly and firmly, with perfect adherence to 
the facts of animal life, and without sentimen- 
talit}'. Mr. Litsey does not care to blur over the 
cruelty and the tragedy of the wild, but brings 
most of its heroes relentlessly to their death. 
The very critical may think that in his method 
of narration he shows too much of the college 
theme-writer's fondness for the ' sting in the end 
of the taU'; but the same critical spirit will 
appreciate to the full the keenness of his vision, 
the accuracy of his style, and the restraint 
which shows his power. 

More sumptuous in make-up and illustration 
than any of the books already mentioned is Mr. 
Beebe's 'Two Bird-Lovers in Mexico.' As 
curator of omitholog}- in the Xew York Zoolog- 
ical Park, Mr. Beebe has acquired a ' taste for 
birds ' such as few even of the professional bird- 
lovers possess, and his observations and his pic- 
tures will be of great value to the scientist, as 
well as a pleasure to the imtrained reader. 
Moreover Mr. Beebe and his wife had seeing 
eyes for the land and its people, plants, and ani- 
mals. They give excellent proof of the fact that 
those who travel to see a particular thing see 
more, not only of that thing but of other things, 
than those who wander aimlessly. It is delight- 
ful to find a book which says little of the dust 
in the cities of Mexico, but much of the Audu- 
bon warblers and Inca doves which flv about the

streets in place of English sparrows; which 
instead of scolding at the dishonesty of the 
natives records their mercy in driving off the 
American plume-hunters who would have 
destroyed the entire species of egrets; and which 
instead of expressing disgust at the myriad life 
which infests the ground and the air, chronicles 
the enjoyment the writers had in watching the 
lizards that crept about their camp, and in 
studying on moonliglit nights the shadows of 
flying-squirrels that made a 'chute' of their 
tent-roof. Mrs. Beebe's closing chapter on ' How 
We Did it' contains practical advice about 
clothing and camp outfit which ought to tempt 
other travellers to follow her example. 

Mr. Eraser's '^ Sa' Zada Tales' bring echoes 
from lands more remote than Mexico. The book 
is as unique and attractive in plan as in title. 
To forget the heat of summer evenings in the 
Greater City the animals of the Zoo meet for 
entertainment, each in turn inviting his friends 
to gather in front of his ' apartment ' and hear 
the story of his life. Sa' Zada the keeper is 
always present, and has no difficulty in main- 
taining order. Each animal tells a characteristic 
tale showing the traits of his race and revealing 
his own peculiarities. The stories themselves 
are enjoyable, though nearly all, of necessity, 
reach their denouement in the capture of the 
narrator. On the way in which they are told 
perhaps in frankness two comments should be 
made, — first that no one expects another 'Jungle 
Book' will ever appear, and second that the 
dialogue is rather badly managed. Wild ani- 
mals, even though caged, would probably be 
impolite enough to interrupt each other in' con- 
versation; yet to represent them as doing so 
continually, spoils the telling of a story. But in 
spite of this fault the volume, which is large and 
beautifully illustrated, will be a treasure-trove 
to children who love animals and who love to 
hear them talk. 

For older readers who care less for the story- 
element, and more for the minute record which 
catches 'the harmonious rhythm of the great 
machine which we call Nature,' Mr. E. Kay 
Eobinson's book of English out-door life will 
prove a special delight. 'The Country Day 
by Day' does for England, but more "^elabo- 
rately, what Mr. Bradford Torrey's ' The Clerk 
of the Woods ' has done for America. In deli- 
cate appreciation of everything that happens 
under the wide and starry sky the two writers 
are much alike. Eeaders trained on Hawthorne 
and Thoreau may think it strange that in mak- 
ing so careful a daily calendar Mr. Kobinson 
does not give under each date his observations 
for a particular day, but chooses rather 'to 
fit the average day with its proj^er seasonal 
event.' But there is no carping at the fulness 



and accuracy with which this method is car- 
ried out, each day chronicling some event 
different from every other. Whoever wishes 
to prepare his eyes to see the birds and beasts, 
iu sects and flowers of England, and the subtle 
changes which cross the face of that country 
from season to season — even to the changing 
tints of ' the pale thrift, which in earlier 
Summer spreads a pink film over the sea- 
wastes ' — will cherish Mr. Eobinson's book 
with gratitude. 

Wholly different in character from any of 
these books, and in some ways more signif- 
icant than any of them, is Mr. John Bur- 
roughs's 'Ways of Nature.' Having in mind 
the controversy between those who believe that 
animals reason and those who do not, Mr. Bur- 
roughs has set himself to give a comprehensive 
statement of his o\^'n views. This he does with 
considerable clearness, and no apparent rancor 
or prejudice; and what he says will command 
the permanent attention and respect of all na- 
ture-lovers. Briefly, Mr. Burroughs thinks that 
animals seldom, if ever, reason. He says : 

'It is 38 plain as anything can be that the ani- 
mals share our emotional nature in vastly greater 
measure than they do our intellectual or our moral 
nature; and because they do this, because they 
show fear, love, joy, anger, sympathy, jealousy, 
because they suffer and are glad, because they 
form friendships and local attachments and have 
the home and paternal instincts, in short, because 
their lives run parallel to our own in so many 
particulars, we come, if we are not careful, to 
ascribe to them the whole human psychology. But 
it is equally plain that of what we mean by mind, 
intellect, they show only a trace now and then. 
. . Instinct, natural prompting, is the main mat- 
ter, after all. It makes up at least nine-tenths of 
the lives of all our wild neighbors.' 

To this belief Mr. Burroughs holds with a 
fair degree of consistency, working it out in 
many interesting details, and explaining away 
many apparent exceptions. His advice to the 
writers of animal stories he sums up thus 
tersely : ' Humanize your facts to the extent 
of making them interesting, if you have the art 
to do it, but leave the dog a dog, and the strad- 
dle bug a straddle bug.' 

It is interesting to notice how the boolcs on 
which we have been commenting arrange them- 
selves alx)ut the line which Mr. Burroughs lays 
down. On one side are those of Mr. Long and 
Mr. Eoberts, who believe that ' among the higher 
orders the greater part of an animal's life is 
directed not by a blind instinct but by a very 
wide-awake intelligence'; somewhere nearer i\\Q 
liue, but still on the ' romancing ' side, are Mr. 
Thompson Seton's stories ; and well on the other 
side are those of the other writers, who quite 
plainly call ' a straddle bug a straddle bug.' 
Undoubtedly the controversy has been a good 
thing, calling for the confession on the part of

is a practically unknown subject, and increasing 
the desire of both parties in the argument for 
greater knowledge and greater fidelity to truth.

The Bise axd Fall of AVolset.* 



The Life of Wolsey by George Cavendish is a 
well-known book, and has interest for many 
readers. To the historian it gives a first-hand 
account of an important man. To the student 
of life and manners it gives a most curious 
picture of society. To the linguist it gives the 
English of a cultivated speaker at a time when 
such testimonials are not common. To the 
Shakespearean student it gives interesting com- 
parisons with ' Henry YIII.' and indeed other 
plays. To the student of English literature it 
offers the first regular biography in our tongue. 
It is a valuable book. 

As such it was wholly appropriate that it 
should be issued in beautiful form. There are 
other editions available to the student and those 
who must limit their book-bills, but there has 
been nothing really worthy the character of the 
book, relatively and intrinsically. We rather 
regret that the book could not have been edited 
in such a way as to bring out its literary and 
linguistic importance. Its vocabulary, for 
instance, is curious: it gives us an idea of the 
general use of words at the time that Sir 
Thomas Elyot undertook to enrich the language. 
But such matters are not appropriate to such an 
edition as this. What is here proper is clear 
type, beautiful paper, and elegant binding, all 
of which we have. Also we very properly find 
here many very characteristic illustrations, some 
chosen from Holbein's portraits of the notables 
of the period, and some from less known sources. 
The care of the publishers presents the work of 
Cavendish in a worthy dress : inside and out all 
is well done. 

Aside from it* attraction to the lover of beau- 
tiful books, however, or to the historian or the 
student of language, this book is most interest- 
ing. It is an account of a remarkable life at a 
remarkable time, but perhaps its intrinsic inter- 
est is as great as ami:hing else. George Caven- 
dish in his countrv' home, after his master's fall, 
meditated upon the greatness he had known. 
He must have composed his book not merely to 
do justice to his late master, but also to free 
his mind of the reflections on the instability of 
greatness that had thronged about his thoughts 
of Wolsey. It was a fruitful theme in the

Middle Ages and the Kenaissance, — the rise 
and downfall of great men, the turn of For- 
tune's wheel. ' The wondrous mutability of 
vain honors, brittle assurance of abundance, 
the uncertainty of dignities, the scattering of 
feigned friends, and the fickle trust of worldly 
princes ' is easily perceived in this rise to great- 
ness, this gathering of riches ' by travail, study 
and pains,' this elevation to dignity for twenty 
years, all to be cast down and destroyed in the 
shortness of a single twelvemonth. The dra- 
matic character of it all was what struck Caven- 
dish, the enormous pomp and state of the Cardi- 
nal's household and the miserable nothingness 
to which it all vanished away in the days at 
Esher, where ' my lord and his family continued 
to the space of three or four weeks, without 
beds, sheets, table-cloths, cups, and dishes to 
eat our meat, or to lie in.' He does not, cer- 
tainly, deal with the matter with great art, nor 
with a very clear perception of the true char- 
acter of Wolsey or of the real reason for his 
fall. But he does, even in his simplicity, give 
a strong impression of the thing that had so 
much impressed him. It surely was a remark- 
able career and one to cause reflection. The rise 
and fall of Wolsey, — the rise rapid, unscrupu- 
lous, and complete; the fall sudden, unavoid- 
able, even mysterious, but absolute, — the con- 
trast was to Cavendish everything. To this he 
subordinates all, not with art, as it would seem, 
but simply, as if forced to express the great idea 
that had so imposed itself on him. 

It is in this more essentially literary way, 
as a tragedy of life, that the work makes its 
strongest appeal. The old gentleman usher, 
revolving the fortunes of his former master to 
whom he was so utterly loyal, becomes almost a 
man of letters in his intense appreciation, and 
his direct simplicity has something of the qual- 
ity of fine literary art.

[Dec. 1, 



shared with us their recollections of the days 
when all the world was young. 

During the past few years many such books, 
of varying excellence, have been greeted with an 
eagerness which proves that as a people our 
hearts are sound at the core, and that even the 
most worldly among us are open to an appeal 
from the remembered past. This list is now 
enlarged by the appearance of two clever books, 
'When You Were a Boy' by Mr. Edwin L. 
Sabin, and ' Back Home ' by Mr. Eugene Wood, 
both of which will probably outrival most of 
their predecessors in popular favor, since they 
treat of life from a boy's standpoint, — and a 
single boy is, as all the world knows, of more 
value than many girls, in books or out of them. 

Perhaps there may be things worth writing 
about in the lives of city children. It is hard 
to believe it, but it may be true. It is certain, 
however, that the years' are all too short for the 
stirring events that crowd the hours of the for- 
tunate child who is born and bred in the coun- 
try, — or, better yet, in a country town, in 
which there is enough of nature for council and 
companionship, and enough of man to gratify 
the social instinct and to call into being certain 
phases of life impossible alike on the farm and 
in the city. Both Mr. Wood and Mr. Sabin 
were evidently heirs to this golden birthright. 
Not else could they have so interpreted the joys 
of snowballing, coasting, swimming, the Circus, 
the County Fair, the Firemen's tournament, 
school-days proper, the Sunday School with its 
picnics and Christmas trees, and all the innu- 
merable happenings of village life. Not else 
could they have pictured so vividly that great, 
honest, wholesome stratum of society which Mr. 
Lincoln loved as the plain people. Not else 
could they have discerned that in some boys are 
all boys, — happy-go-lucky, care-free, idle, busy, 
mischief-loving, sound-hearted, as you can see 
(and hear) them a dozen times a day, if you, 
too, live in a country town and not too far from 
the school-house. The girls do not matter 
much, and the grown people only come in now 
and then. In the text of these volumes, and in 
the excellent drawings of Mr. Frost and Mr. 
Steele, the boy's the thing. 

Here is a bit from ' Back Home ' which will 
give a taste of its quality : 

'We still had some good kind of a time, but 
nothing like the good times they had out at the 
school near grandpap's, where I sometimes visited. 
There you could whisper! Yes, sir, you could whis- 
per. So long as you didn 't talk out loud it was 
all right. And there was no rising at the tap of the 
bell, forming in line, and walking in lock-step. 
Seemingly it never entered the school boards' heads 
that anybody would ever be sent to state's prison. 
They left the scholars unprepared for any such 
career. They have remedied all that in city 
schools. Now, when a boy grows up and goes to 



Sing Sing he knows exactly what to do, and how 
to behave. It all comes back to him,' 

And thus writes Mr, Sabin of his dog : 

'Thus the dog vanished from your daily life, and 
for weeks the house and yard seemed very strange 
without him. Then, gradually the feeling that you 
were to come upon him unexpectedly, around the 
corner, wore off. You grew reconciled. But to this 
day you are constantly encountering him in dream- 
land. He hasn't changed, and in his sight appar- 
ently you haven't changed. You are once more boy 
and dog together. This leads you to hope and to 
trust — indeed to believe — that notwithstanding 
your mother's gentle admonition, you will see him 
again, in fact as well as fancy, after all.' 

It seems a pity that both books contain so 
much slang, — even so much quite modern 
slang. It is a pity, too, that Mr. Wood, writing 
of the days of the Bollo and Little Prudy books, 
should have introduced a man who wished to 
enlist in the Boer war, and a baby named 
Teddy — ' He's named after Theodore Roose- 
velt, and they have the letter home, framed, and 
hanging over the organ.' 

The moral of these pleasant books is not for 
children, as morals are usually supposed to be, 
but for parents. ' Back Home,' they cry, to the 
simpler, truer, sweeter life, the saner pleasures, 
the purer air, that filled the whole world ' When 
You Were a Boy ' ! Saea Andrew Shafer.

Mr. William Eleroy Curtis, the well-known 
newspaper correspondent, has many literary 
virtues that commend him to his readers. Sim- 
plicity, rapidity, vividness, and a certain 
positiveness, mark his writings, and have won 
for him a wide circle of daily readers. He 
has unusual faculties for observing the surface 
life of foreign lands, and the ability to mar- 
shal his data in good order. His two recent 
books entitled respectively ' Egypt, Burma, and 
Malaysia ' and ' Slodern India ' are models of 
a reporter's note-book in foreign lands. Both 
volumes contain pertinent and unbiased infor- 
mation about the politics, religions, education, 
industries, and society of the countries named. 
In the first named book, * Eg)^t, Burma, and 
Malaysia,' the author conducts us over the 
usual routes and amid often described scenes. 
Port Said, Alexandria, Cairo, ' ever new and 
novel to the oldest traveler,' the Pyramids, the 
Sphinx, and the Nile, are of course the main 
points of interest in Egypt. To add anything 
new to these old familiars would be impos- 
sible; but Mr. Curtis's view-point is at times 
refreshing. It is out of the common run of 
description to read that the famous ideal of 
mystery in stone has ' no more expression than 
there would be in any sandstone image that 
has been hit square on the nose by a three 
hundred pound shot fired from a French 
cannon and had its features scattered over a 
square mile of desert.' The Nile, always the 
most interesting of rivers, is to extend its in- 
fluence by means of the large dam at Assuan, 
which will create a reservoir a hundred and 
forty miles square, capable of storing several 
billion tons of water for use in the dry sea- 
son. Mr. Curtis pays due attention and re- 
spect to the tombs and temples, the Suez canal, 
Arabia and the Persian problem, the mission- 
ary problem, and to the redemption of the 
Sudan. Egypt's rapid advance in civilized 
ways is due, says Mr. Curtis, to two causes: 
the noble work of the missionaries, and to Lord 
Cromer, the English resident and de facto 
ruler. To the English and to the Chinese in 
Burma also, the credit is given for driving out 
much of the darkness and for advancing the 
interests of that country. 

We hesitate to pronounce Mr. Curtis's ' Mod- 
ern India ' the best book of its kind, — that 
is, a reporter's note-book, — but we can say 
unreservedly that it is a very helpful book for 
those who wish data upon which to base a 
reasonable judgment of the actual state of af- 
fairs in that country. The author lays the 
whole situation before the reader, — the eco- 
nomic features, the famine question, the gov- 
ernment, the industrial development, climate, 
population, religion, and the natural resources ; 



all are explained graphically and concisely. 
Interspersed chapters give us pictures of a 
Hindu wedding ceremony, the motions of a 
vast Mohammedan audience at prayer at Agra, 
the Taj Mahal, 'the most beautiful building 
in the world, which many have sprawled all 
over the dictionary without conveying the 
faintest idea of its glories and loveliness,' the 
gilded marble palaces of the Moguls at Delhi, 
and the holy city of Benares with its two 
thousand temples, its half a million idols, its 
beggars, priests, fakirs, ascetics, all living in 
' one of the most interesting cities in the 
world, yet the most filthy, repulsive, and for- 
bidding.' Concerning Ix)rd Curzon's admin- 
istration, Mr. Curtis has only words of praise. 
' Lord Curzon's rule has been a conspicuous 
and remarkable success. Although he has been 
severely criticised for his administrative pol- 
icy, and many of his ofiicial acts have been 
opposed and condemned, the sources from 
which the criticisms have come often corrobo- 
rate the wisdom and confirm the success of the 
acts complained of.' To catalogue all that 
Mr. Curtis has written about India in this 
volume would require a column of print. 
There is much information, with statistics, 
about trade, the Hindu caste system, the Mogul 
Empire, the mutiny, the number of per- 
sons killed annually by snakes, tigers, and 
other wild beasts, Indian railways, nautch 
girls, fakirs, thugs, Rajahs, Maharajahs, 
Nizams, the Afghanistan frontier question, the 
Lhasa mission, and a host of other things, 
major and minor. 

Mr. Curtis's volume on India takes us ovei 
the main-travelled roads, but the book en- 
titled 'Eifle and Eomance in the Indian

Captain A. I. R. Glasfurd of the Indian Army, 
spent nearly fourteen years in the 'jungly 
section,' and now gives an account of his 
varied experiences in the paradise of big-game 
hunters. In his own words, ' These jungle 
sketches do not deal with what is perhaps the 
popular idea of Indian sport — the imposing 
line of elephants, the gay party, the "file-fir- 
ing" of the battue, and piles of slain. They 
are merely the records of the quiet solitary 
shikari (hunter) who, lacking either the 
means or the inclination — or both — for the 
slaughtering of a large amount of game in a 
short space of time without the exercise of per- 
sonal effort of woodcraft, works alone, or in 
the company of a single comrade, and with 
his simple equipment penetrates to retired 
spots — the peaceful haunts of game.' The 
chapter titles comprising the volume are sug- 
gestive of their enlivening contents. 'The

wild chases, hair-breadth escapes, the telling

Captain Glasfurd prides himself, we believe, 
on his own drawings in the book; but they are 
not artistic, nor do they enhance the realism 
of the various scenes he sketches. 

Mr. Caspar Whitney, editor of the ' Outing ' 
magazine, who won his laurels as a mighty 
hunter some years ago in the Far North, now 
adds to his fame by his recent travels in the 
Ear East, in India, Sumatra, Malay, and Siam. 
His volume bearing the title 'Jungle Trails 
and Jungle People ' is the record of a trip 
prompted by the lust of adventure, and by the 
desire to see strange lands and strange peoples, 
and to hunt strange animals. Mr. Whitney 
has caught the trick of making a little human 
interest enhance the vivid story of some thril- 
ling or stirring hunting adventure. Che Poh 
Lek, the King's mahout, interests us almost as 
much as does the tale of the royal Siamese 
hunt for wild elephants; Phra Eam, who goes 
with the author for buffalo in the Siam-Bur- 
mese section, wins us as an example of Ori- 
ental subtlety and of Ear Eastern philosophy; 
Cheeta, Aboo Din, Jin Abu, Uda Prang, all 
hunters or servants, enlighten us as to the 
mental and moral habits of the natives of the 
countries described. The too-often maligned 
Siamese finds a defender in Mr. Whitney. 
Here is his picture, taken from the chapter 
entitled 'Through the Klawngs (canals) of 
Siam/ of the life of the Siamese: 

'My travels have never brought me among a 
people seemingly more contented than these 
Siamese. Their wants are few and easily supplied: 
a single piece of stuff completes the scanty, inex- 
pensive costume; rice and fruit and fish, to be had 
for almost nothing, constitute the food; betel nuts, 
which high and low chew, may be gathered. Life 
moves very easily for them, and they go to their 
death with unbounded faith that Buddha will take 
care of the next world, whatever it may be. Living, 
they hold to their simple faith as conscientiously 
as the Mohammedans, which is tantamount to say- 
ing more conscientiously than the Christian sects. 
Dying, they pass with confidence into the unknown; 
and their bodies are burned and the ashes scat- 
tered to the four winds. Their attitude toward 
life is truly philosophic; and friends left behind 
conduct themselves with equal sanity.' 

We should like to make many and long quo- 
tations from the book, telling about exciting 
affairs in the luxuriant jungle; of how wild 
elephants are rounded up and driven into the 



kraal at Ayuthia, the old Siamese capitol; of 
the trotting ' rhino ' of Kelantan ; of boar- 
hunting in Malay; and of a wonderfully nerve- 
racking experience with a tiger. But our 
space forbids. It is sufiicient to say that Mr. 
Whitney has written a volume of travel and 
adventure that will make his name conspicu- 
ous among American hunters. 

The volume entitled ' Far Eastern Impres- 
sions,' by Mr. Ernest F. G. Hatch, M.P., is a 
straightforward account of a business trip in 
Japan, Korea, and China. Mr. Hatch made his 
tour three years ago, and ' took pains to collect 
and note down many facts and opinions bearing 
on the Far Eastern problem, and particularly 
upon its commercial aspects.' His impressions, 
which are weighty enough to bear a stronger 
word, relate chiefly to politics, concessions, 
commercial prospects, and railway develop- 
ment, particularly in China. The chief note 
concerning Japan points out that that country 
is rigidly Protectionist, in view of which fact 
she will be likely to seek to create new and ex- 
clusive markets for herself in the sphere of her 
conquests, and to take all for her own by im- 
posing an exceedingly onerous tariff. Of the 
Chinese as allies of the British, the author, 
after complimenting the British diplomats on 
their British honesty and straightforwardness, 
says : ' Deep down in the heart of the China- 
man there is an abiding faith in our country 
[England]. He believes in our disinterested- 
ness and our genuine desire to help China. He 
trusts us as he trusts no other outsider.' Much 
attention is given to railway concessions in 
China. Mr. Hatch regards the concessions 
given by the Chinese government to various 
countries for building railroads as indicating 
very closely the ambition of the international 
giants. Russia, France, Germany, England, 
and America lead in these concessions; and if 
Mr. Hatch's opinion be correct, the first four 
are tending to monopolize the concessions, to 
the detriment of England's commercial and 
political power. On the other hand, British 
diplomacy is evidently working to establish a 
great line of railway from Shanghai to Chen 
Tu, a line that will ultimately be a bond of 
communication between China and the Indian 
Empire. An excellent map showing these rail- 
way concessions forms the frontispiece to the 
book. If the much discussed break-up of China 
ever occurs, Mr. Hatch thinks that Japan will 
take the lion's share of the spoils; while Eng- 
land, if she pursues her present policy, will 
be a good second in the game. Mr. Hatch's 
impressions are not mere chance gatherings 
and ill-digested glimpses; they are acute and 
weighty observations upon the things that ap-

peal to a business man interested in polities. 
The volume is well indexed, well illustrated, 
and written in a clear and forcible style. 

In striking contrast to the thorough discus- 
sion of Far Eastern questions in the work just 
noticed is the volume entitled ^John China- 
man at Home/ by the Eeverend E. J. Hardy, 
who for over three years was Chaplain to His 
Majesty's Forces at Hong Kong. To vary Moth's 
comment to Costard, Mr. Hardy has been at a 
ieast of sights and stolen the scraps. His vol- 
ume is a very medley of things Chinese, — Chi- 
nese cities with their local peculiarities; Chi- 
nese food, medicine, clothes, houses and gar- 
dens, servants and laborers; customs of mar- 
riage, burial, and mourning; Chinese boys, 
wx)men, and girls, their manners, education, 
punishments; religions, superstitions, spirits, 
monks and priests, foreign missionaries. New 
Year devotions and rites, government, — and 
much more. One is tempted to use the simile 
of a bushel of chaff, with all these items; but 
such a comparison would convey a wrong im- 
pression of the book. Mr. Hardy takes his task 
seriously, and does not hold Chinese charac- 
teristics up to ridicule. There may be, indeed, 
an overplus of small knowledge about the oddi- 
ties and curiosities in this land of topsy-tur- 
veydom. but such knowledge is often indicative 
of the basic life of a people. Certainly Mr. 
Hardy can hardly be accused of levity when he 
makes the following comparison between John 
Chinaman and John Bull: 

' Englishmen and Chinamen should be good 
friends, for they have much in common. Both 
have a great capacity for making, saving, and 
«njoying money. Both are enterprising in com- 
merce, and both will stick to their bargains. Both 
build substantial buildings , as, for instance, 
bridges, and both take a pride in good work. The 
■Chinese are not less characterized by common- 
sense than Englishmen, and they have John Bull's 
solidity, respect for law, and conservatism. Neither 
John JBull nor John Chinaman allow sentiment to 
interfere with business, and there is nothing they 
■value more than a good dinner.' 

For one who contemplates a hurried journey 
through the lands of the ' Son of Heaven,' Mr. 
Hardy's book will be a most acceptable eye- 
opener to Chinese characteristics. 

Sidney Smith once begged Lord John Kussell 
to ' write a History of Louis XI Y., and put the 
world right about that old Beast.' To apply 
such a generic term as this latter to the Empress 
Dowager of China would be neither polite nor 
politic were it not a fact that less charitable 
and more specific epithets have been applied to 
"her. As a matter of fact the world knows little 
or nothing of the personal life of the Empress, 
and will likely know but little more. Miss 
Katharine A. Carl, through the influence of 
Mrs. Conger, wife of the United States Minister, 



was called to the Chinese court to paint the 
Dowagers portrait, and for eleven months she 
dwelt in a palace next to the throne room. 
Moreover, she was, so she says, * the first for- 
eigner to be domiciled in any residence of a 
Son of Heaven since the time of Marco Polo, 
and the only foreigner who had ever been 
within the Ladies' Precincts.' Much would 
naturally be expected from such a golden oppor- 
tunity, but we must say that Miss Carl in her 
book called ' With the Empress Dowager ' has 
not fulfilled the promise of her title. There is 
much entertaining tittle-tattle in the volume 
about Chinese court life, but Her Majesty is 
lost in the distent perspective. Here is Miss 
Carl's description of the Empress, probably the 
first accurate pen picture of the woman : 

'A perfectly proportioned figure, with head well 
set upon her shoulders and a fine presence; really 
beautiful hands, daintily small and high bred in 
shape; a symmetrical, well formed head, with a 
good development above the rather large ears; jet 
black hair, smoothly parted over a fine, broad brow; 
delicate, well-arched eyebrows; brilliant, black eyes, 
set perfectly straight in the head; a high nose, of 
the type the Chinese call ''noble," broad between 
the eyes and on a line with the forehead; an upper 
lip of great firmness, a rather large but beautiful 
mouth with mobile, red lips, which, when parted 
over her firm white teeth, gave her smile a rare 
charm; a strong chin, but not of exaggerated firm- 
ness, and with no marks of obstinacy. Had I not 
known that she was nearing her sixty-ninth year, 
I should have thought her a well preserved woman 
of forty. Being a widow she used no cosmetics. 
Her face had the natural glow of health, and one 
could see that exquisite care and attention were 
bestowed upon everything concerning her toilet. 
Personal neatness and an excellent taste in the 
choice of becoming colors and ornaments enhanced 
this wonderfully youthful appearance, and a look 
of keen interest in her surroundings and remark- 
able intelligence crowned all these physical quali- 
ties and made an unusually attractive personality.' 

Such a description conveys little idea of a 
woman with the ' soul of a tiger ' or other beastly 
attributes by which the Empress has heretofore 
been described. The volume is attractive in 
physical make-up, and enlivened with pictures 
of an unusual kind. 

With an avant-propos by Youssef Zia Pacha 
El Khalidy, ex-mayor of Jerusalem, a preface 
by Prince de Polignac, Colonel of the French 
Army in Algiers, and an introduction which is 
a confession, Madame Hayacinthe Loyson, an 
American-born woman, and wife of the vener- 
able Father Hayacinthe of Paris, publishes a 
book with the oracular title 'To Jerusalem 
Through the Lands of Islam.' We call the 
title oracular, because it partly reveals and 
partly conceals the contents of the volume. As 
a book of travels, it recounts the journey of 
Madame Loyson and her husband in Xorth 
Africa and Palestine. But the ulterior pur- 
pose of the Loysons was not to see these coun-

tries with the outer eye; it was rather to view 
them with the inner eye of the spirit. It 
was a ' tour of Christian exploration ' for 
the purpose of reconciling all believers in the 
same God, — and particularly among ' Mussel- 
mans and Christians.' Everywhere in the 
book there is the intense spiritual earnestness 
of a good woman holding conferences with the 
leading representatives of Islam. As our in- 
terest in the book is largely personal, we take 
the following excerpt to reveal the character 
of the author. She has been in the desert 
preaching to the whole world, and at night re- 
quests to be left alone. Her emotions are 
described as follows: 

'As the sun's great disk dropped slowly through 
the golden atmosphere and touched the horizon, I 
was seized with an indescribable but ecstatic awe 
which made me tremble in every limb. 
The stars burst forth in such suddenness and splen- 
dor that it already seemed midnight! And now 
as I mounted a huge wave of sand, the evening 
breeze which rises from off the Nile at sunset came 
to me in such grateful suggestion that I felt the 
beating wings of those very angels who bore my 
glorious Patron, Saint Catherine of Alexandria, 
when she was broken and dead, across the desert 
and across the sea, up to Mount Sinai! So exalted 
was my soul, that my feet had long ceased to 
move, and I stood still, — or rather I was upheld, 
for my own volition had vanished; but the angels 
• — her angels — were keeping me company.' 

The most substantial and scientific book in 
our present list is the two-volume work bear- 
ing the title ' The Jordan Valley and Petra,' 
by Dr. William Libbey, Professor of Physical 
Geography in Princeton University, and Dr. 
Franklin E. Hoskins of the Syria Mission at 
Beirut. Their trip, which was made less dif- 
ficult than such trips usually are in Syria and 
the Holy Land by a letter from the "Waly of 
Damascus to the Mutaserrif of Kerak, asking 
him to take them down to Petra and bring 
them back again, was from Joppa by sea to 
Sidon and eastward to Mount Lebanon, then 
south to the Sea of Galilee, along the eastern 
side of the Jordan Valley to Petra, the valley 
of Moses, then back to the Dead Sea, and west 
of it to Jerusalem and Joppa, Such a journey 
leads one ' into regions of country and of 
history that are far from the beaten line of 
the ordinary traveller.' The book, which con- 
tains a unique series of photographs, gives a 
vivid and picturesque account of the present 
condition of the country through which the 
children of Islam passed from their bondage in 
Egypt to the Promised Land. From much 
material in the volumes that is profitable and 
interesting, we shall confine ourselves to a 
consideration of three points : the Jordan river, 
the mosaic map at Madeba in Moab, and to 
Pharoah's Treasury at Petra. Concerning the 
meandering of the Jordan, Dr. Libbey 



offers the explanation that the river, after 
reaching a point below the sea level, finds its 
bed rising, and that this rising to the south 
would account for the serpentine course of the 
stream. Commenting further on this peculiar- 
ity of the sacred river, he says: 

'Perhaps the strangest thing about this famous 
river is that none of the ancients ever guessed at 
this curious feature of the stream. They journeyed 
up and down the Jordan Valley since before the 
days of Abraham; they climbed down the roads 
from Jerusalem to Jericho and up into Moab and 
Edom; they built roads east and west of the Jor- 
dan, joining the seacoast and the desert, cutting 
the Jordan Valley at many points and angles; they 
built roads and bridges and cities at levels far 
below the surface of the Mediterranean, and yet 
never seem to have suspected that this stream dif- 
fered from most of the rivers of the globe in this 
respect, Greeks, Eomans, and Mohammedans, Jews, 
Christians, and Crusaders knew every nook and 
cranny of its winding course, but failed to realize 
that while its head and source rested high on noble 
Hermon's side, its mouth in the Dead Sea, unlike 
most other river endings, was far below the sur- 
face of the habitable world and all the surrounding 
oceans.' 

Next to the discovery of the famous Moabite 
stone. Dr. Libbey considers the discovery of 
the remains of an ancient mosaic map at 
Madeba as the most important archaeological 
' find ' beyond the Jordan. The map, which 
probably dates from the fifth century, is drawn 
from east to west, and is possibly a geographi- 
cal picture of the land which Moses looked 
down upon from Mount Pisgah. The chief 
interest in the map is that it is likely to upset 
some old and cherished beliefs in Biblical 
geography. The authors spent five days in 
the city of Petra, 'a rose-red city half as old 
as Time,' where only twenty-five Europeans 
have entered during a hundred years, and near- 
ly all of whom entered by stealth, and more 
than half were driven out after a hurried 
glance at the wonders and mysteries of the 
place. Not more than three or four were al- 
lowed to spend a night within the ruins, but 
our two authors remained five days and floated 
the American flag unmolested within the an- 
cient city. The entrance to this ' strangest 
city on our planet,' and the first view of * Phar- 
aoh's Treasury', are described as follows : 

'Seen at morning, at midday, or at midnight, the 
Sik, this matchless entrance to a hidden city is 
unquestionably one of the great glories of ancient 
Petra, We wandered on, amazed, enchanted, and 
delighted, not wishing for, not expecting anything 
that could be finer than this, when a look ahead 
warned us that we were approaching some monu- 
ment worth attention, and suddenly we stepped out 
of the naiTow gorge into the sunlight again. There 
in front of us, carved in the face of the cliff, 
half-revealed, half-concealed, in the growing shad- 
ows, was one of the largest, most perfect, and most 
beautiful monuments of antiquity, — Pharaoh's 
Treasury! '

We have taken more space than usual in

Holiday Pitblicatioxs. 

L 



One of the most sumptuous and elaborate of the 
year's holiday issues is 'The Gardens of Italy' 
(imported by Scribner), a two-volume crown folio, 
dedicated by special permission to the King of 
Italy and containing brief descriptions of some 
forty splendid villa gardens, with over two hun- 
dred full-page illustrations. The book is pub- 
lished from the offices of the English periodical, 
'Country Life,' a fact which will vouch for the 
artistic excellence of the half-tones. These are 
made from photographs specially taken by Mr. 
Charles Latham, whose very beautiful and dis- 
criminating work has appeared in former publica- 
tions from the ' Country Life ' press. The gardens 
of the villa Albani occupy the place of honor in 
the fii-st volume and exemplify at once, for the 
uninitiated, the Italian connotation of the term. 
In extent, magnificence, and variety, in the almost 
complete absence of modern floral effects and the 
relatively small part played even by formal bed- 
ding, with the corresponding importance of sta- 
tuary and of architectural features done in stone 
and marble — terrace stairways, pavilions, foun- 
tains, and facades, — in all these respects the 
Albani villa is a typical example of the great 
Italian garden. Such a garden cannot be viewed 
apart from the villa of which it is an adjunct ; the 
pictures show clearly the unity of effect for which 
the old designers worked. They show, too, that 
a garden like the 'Great Cardinal's' possessed 
all the splendor and variety of a palace, and like 
a palace was planned to be lived in day after day, 
and to satisfy the varying moods of its owner, 
as well as the variant conditions imposed by 
changing houi's and seasons. Accompanying the 
illustrations of each villa is a brief historical 
and descriptive sketch by Mrs. Evelyn March 
Phillipps. "Without being at all abstruse or ana- 
lytical, these essays serve to interpret the pictures 
by pointing out the distinctive features of each 
garden, and tell enough of the villa's history to 
furnish the setting of human associations without 
which nothing in Italy is really significant. The 
reader is not allowed to forget the stately and mag- 
nificent past of the Medicis, the Borghese princes, 
and the immortal Boccaccio,— a past now turned 
to melancholy silence fraught with memories ; nor 
the 'frivolous, bygone summers,' when gay lords 
and lovely ladies paced the shaded walks, talked 
of life and love in the sham-classic temples to 
Diana, and amused themselves with the sparkling 
fountains and tricksy water-works, which jetted 
unexpectedly and kept their victims prisoners un- 



til they could discover the secret spring. More 
than half the first volume is occupied with Roman 
villas; in the second the Florentine gardens are 
equally prominent. There is no effort at chron- 
ological arrangement and no formal study of the 
development of Italian horticulture, but the read- 
er who is so inclined may find plenty of sugges- 
tions for such a study. For example, the pictures 
of the villa Garzoni at CoUodi illustrate the be- 
ginning of the decadence of the art of gardening. 
There the ideal of the designer is boldness, sweep, 
and a grand coup d'oeil as the visitor enters, 
instead of the gradual revelation of one beautiful 
vista after another that was the peculiar charm 
of the gardens of an earlier day. There are pic- 
tured other gardens, which, departing entirely 
from Italian artificiality and primness, show 
English effects of park and wild-wood, and gar- 
dens whose modern owners have defied Italian 
conventions by growing masses of lilies, roses, 
and carnations. If one has seen the gardens of 
Italy he cannot but enjoy and profit by a second 
visit under Mr. Latham's able guidance. He who 
has never seen them will find the present treat- 
ment at once comprehensive and suggestive. The 
folios are neatly and durably bound in green 
linen. It is a pity that their sumptuous form 
necessarily puts them out of the reach of many 
purses. 

It is an interesting coincidence of the pub- 
lishing season which brings Mr. Howells's 'Lon- 
don Films' (Harper) and Mr. Henry James's 
'English Hours' (Houghton) into juxtaposition 
on the reviewer's table. The latter, to be sure, 
is only an illustrated reprint of essays belong- 
ing to Mr. James's splendid prime, while the 
former is a collection of fresh impressions of 
London, based on a recent sojourn there; but 
the contrast is none the less interesting and 
profitable. Readers of Mr. James's recent 
novels, unless they belong to the small minority 
who have fallen uncritically under the spell 
of his vagaries of style, will turn with relief 
to Mr. James at his best, exhibiting at once 
his keenest and most lucid analytical genius. 
The zest of living and of knowing life runs 
strongly on every page, despite Mr, James's re- 
cent revision of the essays. The motive of 
finding the interesting beneath the common- 
place,— surely the artistic motive,— is evei*- 
present. But whereas it has seemed to more 
than Peter Bell that Mr. James has recently 
been devoting himself to the dissection of some 
very faded and unpromising primroses, with the 
result that might easily be foreseen,— these in- 
terpretations of English life carry the reader 
with them by their quality of tonic freshness, 
which takes the place of the bewildering curios- 
ity about everything and nothing characteristic 
of the late novels. All the essays have been 
printed before in one volume or another, most 
of them in 'Portraits and Places.' The excuse 
for the present reprint is therefore Mr. Joseph 
Pennell's delightful drawings, which, in gen- 
erous number, punctuate the text. Besides be- 
ing good in itself, Mr. Pennell's style suits 
Mr. James's. An attractive cover and fine

workmanship make a volume which is mechan- 
ically worthy of its contents.— Mr. Ho wells him- 
self accommodatingly furnishes the apt simile 
for a comparison between 'English Hours' and 
'London Films.' The latter, he explains in a 
prefatory paragraph, are exactly films — photo- 
graphic negatives taken by his mental kodak 
and developed for the possible pleasure of the 
kindly reader, 'who will surely, if he is the 
right sort of reader, be able to sharpen the 
blurred details, to soften the harsh lights, and 
blend the shadows in a subordination giving 
due relief to the best meaning of the print. 
. . If any one shall say that my little pic- 
tures are superficial, I shall not be able to 
gainsay him. I can only answer that most 
pictures represent the surface of things; but 
at the same time I can fully share the disap- 
pointment of those who would prefer some such 
result as the employment of the Roentgen 
rays would have given, if applied to certain 
aspects of the London world.' This leaves 
the critic quite without a case. Indeed it is 
only because Mr. Howells is so wonderfully 
artistic and subtle a photographer, leaving so 
little necessity for a kindly reader's indulgence, 
that one always wishes he would go lower than 
the surfaces of things,— that his emotions were 
both more spontaneous and more significant. 
But it is late in the day to offer analysis of 
Mr. Howells 's genius. 'London Films' is bound 
uniformly with some other volumes of his es- 
says, and appropriately illustrated with very 
artistic photographs. Its 'films' are far more 
interesting and significant than some that Mr. 
Howells has shown; they are indeed in his 
happiest analytic vein. 

' There is certainly something curiously complete 
in a journey through Spain and along the northeiTi 
coast of Africa; it inscribes a sort of semi-circle 
on the map, like an old cuneiform character mark- 
ing the inscription of splendid centuries.' So 
reads the final sentence of the final essay in that 
sumptuous publication, 'In the Track of the 
Moors' (Dent-Dutton). It cannot be called a 
book of travel in the ordinary sense. The essays 
contain no personal reminiscence; they are inter- 
pretative rather than descriptive, and they often 
run far afield into legend, history, politics, race 
characteristics and development, the inter-play of 
one race upon another, and other problems remote 
from the point of view of the guide-book, whether 
brief and unadorned, or sugar-coated with a liter- 
ary style and atmosphere. The size and weight of 
this book practically precludes its use as a trav- 
elling companion, and its method equally unfits 
it for hasty consultation after a day over-filled 
with sight-seeing. But it is rather as a luxurious 
and leisurely commentary upon travels past or 
to come, as a collection of delightful essays and 
beautiful pictures, that 'In the Track of the 
Moors' should be judged and enjoyed. The book 
is the result of collaboration by Sybil and Augus- 
tine Fitzgerald, the former furnishing the essays 
and the latter the pictures. There are sixty-three 
full-page illustrations excellently printed in color, 
embodying impressions of characteristic street 



and country scenes, of Moorish temples and gar- 
dens, of African mosques and market-places, or of 
Spanish and African types. Besides these pictures 
there are nearly as many smaller drawings in 
black-and-white set in the text, showing interest- 
ing bits of detail which the larger scope of the 
colored plates does not render distinctly. The 
larger plates are richly colored and replete with 
atmosphere and feeling, artistic rather than pho- 
tographic, and losing none of this quality by 
reproduction. They put their emphasis upon 
characteristic features in a Avay that satisfies the 
reader; he can lay aside the book without the 
feeling he often has that the artist has chosen to 
illustrate all the things that no one cares to see. 
It is a pleasant surprise, too, to find that the es- 
says are not mere filling, added to give the book 
an appearance of weight. The essayist is equipped 
for her task by a thorough knowledge of the 
subject, a gift for analysis, and the ability to 
put the results of analysis into trenchant and 
finished form. There are frequent and apt quota- 
tions from French commentators, from the study 
of whom, perhaps, has been gained the exceedingly 
clear-cut point of view and the judicious and 
accurate phrasing. Another merit is the breadth 
of interest displayed; the analysis of the Spanish 
stare is as careful and illuminating as the explan- 
ation of the French people's various theories of 
colonization. It would be well if more of the 
splendid modern editions showed the discrimina- 
tion and real distinction of this beautiful volume. 

Special interest attaches to the tenth book of 
Mr. Charles Dana Gibson's drawings, not only 
because it is the most representative collection 
he has yet given us, but because it is possibly 
the last. It is announced upon good authority 
that Mr. Gibson has forsaken the — to him — 
highly remunerative art of black-and-white, 
because he feels that he has done the best work 
he is capable of in that medium, and that he will 
devote several years at least to foreign study, 
with the intention of working hereafter on a 
larger scale and in color. We shall miss the 
Gibson cartoons. The present collection, issued 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, is uniform 
in size, shape, and binding with the nine volumes 
that have preceded it. It is entitled 'Our Neigh- 
bors,' a phrase generously interpreted to mean 
all sorts and conditions of men and women. The 
Gibson Girl is charmingly portrayed, as well as 
the Gibson Man, the Gibson Dowager, and the 
Gibson Old Gentleman, There are also the street 
types, which, though they are less characteristic^ 
Mr. Gibson has lately made his own. Such car- 
toons as ' The Babv of the Family, ' ' At the Horse 
Show,' 'The New Hat,' and 'To See the Art 
Editor,' show the artist's humor in its broadest 
and most representative aspects, and combine the 
best elements of both his earlier and later man- 
ners. Perhaps Mr. Gibson has done his best in 
black-and-white; at least he will have to do 
something very good indeed to surpass the gen- 
eral level of 'Our Neighbors.'

book called 'The Mysterious Stranger, and Other

Cartoons' (McCIure, Phillips & Co.), Mr. John T. 
McCutcheon expresses the hope that the volume 
maj' have a permanent interest because of the un- 
usual rapidity with -which history has been mak- 
ing in the last two or three years — the period 
covered by the cartoons. As Mr. McCutcheon puts 
it : * There has been a war that was a war. There 
have been disasters almost without parallel ; and 
we have weathered as pleasant a presidential cam- 
paign as the oldest inhabitant can remember. Mr. 
Roosevelt . . and his activities in peace and 
in war and in sports have been a source of un- 
ending inspiration to the cartoonist. In addition, 
the nation has achieved merited glory because of 
the great exposition held in St. Louis, and last, 
but not least, Missouri has taken it into her head 
to go Republican.' It is Mr. McCutcheon 's fa- 
mous cartoon on this last subject that gives a 
name to the collection, which includes over one 
hundred and fifty drawings. Besides those hav- 
ing to do with political subjects, there is the 
amusing series devoted to President Roosevelt's 
vacation exDerienees, several groups of new *Boy 
in Summer' and 'Bird Centre' cartoons, and that 
keen and delightful satire on sectional peculiari- 
ties and prejudices, pictured in the cartoons rep- 
resenting delegations from the various states of 
the Union visiting the St. Louis Fair. Mr. Mc- 
Cutcheon 's work is unique in its understanding 
of our national life, and in the combined keen- 
ness and kindliness of its humor. The cartoons 
are well worth embodying in a form less tran- 
sient than the pages of a daily newspaper. 

'Drawings of Rossetti' is this year's addition 
to the 'Modem Master Draughtsmen' series, the 
volumes of which are published in this country 
by Messrs. Charles Seribner's Sons. This series, 
with the similar one called 'Drawings of the 
Great ^Masters,' now comprises nearly a dozen 
titles, each an ideal study, both in text and illus- 
tration, of one distinctive phase of a great artist's 
work. The introductory comment upon Rossetti 
is written by Mr. T. Martin Wood, and is a dis- 
criminating and illuminating piece of criticism. 
It calls attention to the intensely subjective and 
poetic nature of Rossetti 's art, a characteristic 
which makes it at once unsatisfactory and very 
instructive to consider his work purely in its ex- 
ternal aspect. The drawings alone, so Mr. "Wood 
thinks, are proof that it was in Rossetti 's power 
to be the greatest imaginative illustrator of his 
century. 'That he was not so. seems to prove 
that in this way, as in some others, he failed to 
attain to much that at first had seemed included 
in his destiny.' There is an interesting discus- 
sion of the proper critical attitude from which to 
approach Rossetti 's work, and the fifty drawings 
reproduced in the present volume are treated as 
illustrative material for various theses, thus re- 
cei%-ing considerable detailed attention. The re- 
productions are as distinguished among illustra- 
tions as is the preface among critical essays. 
Many are printed in tint and mounted upon rough 
paper of a harmonizing shade. They represent 
■all stages of work, from the rough sketch to the 



elaborate, highly-finished drawing that was so 
characteristic of one side of Rossetti 's genius. 
With the help of the suggestive introduction, any 
reader, however ignorant he may be of the aims 
and methods of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, may 
learn to understand and in some measure to ap- 
preciate Rossetti 's art. 

The experiences of Noah and his ark have 
long been a favorite theme with humorists; but 
they have never been more perfectlv set forth, 
than in 'The Story of Noah's Ark' (Hough- 
ton), as told and pictured by Mr. E. Boyd 
Smith. The pictures are the feature of the 
book, but they would not be half so amusing 
without the sly and subtle himaor of the brief 
descriptions which accompany them. The build- 
ing of the ark, the assembling of the animals^ 
and the adventures of the voyage are all 
made to yield their full measure of entertain- 
ment. The dinosaurs that had to be left be- 
hind because they were too big for the door,, 
the 'host of other strange beasts with long 
Latin names' that refused to go in and were 
therefore 'doomed to be lost and become fos- 
sils,' the other host that went in and, being 
tossed by the waves, regretted it, until the 
storm passed and they 'took a keen interest in 
the passenger list, to find their own names, as 
passengers always do,' while poor Mrs. Noah 
lamented, sajang 'the domestic arrangements 
are impossible,'— all these episodes are pictured 
with remarkable expressiveness and a clever 
but never too extravagant caricature. The 
plates are artistically reproduced in color, and 
the cover is as amusing as the rest of the 
book. 

A unique contribution to Omar literature, and 
one which will delight the hearts of all true 
Omarites, is the 'Life of Omar al-Khayy ami ^ 
written from the Persian point of view by 
Mr. J. K. M. Shirazi, and imported by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. The volume is bound 
in paper boards daintily decorated in colors 
with a Persian floral pattern, and has illram- 
nated headings, initials, and tail-pieces in a 
similar style. In a brief preface the author 
modestly explains that he does not enter the 
lists against European and American scholar- 
ship, but that he has endeavored to tell the 
life of Omar from the Persian standpoint, and 
to give an account of the tent-maker's philos- 
ophy as it is understood by his many Persian 
admirers. In addition to the usual sources of 
information, he has had access to rare and in- 
teresting manuscripts of unquestionable au>- 
thpnticity, which belong to the Royal House 
of Pei-sia and to Persian nobles and heads of 
religious houses. Many of these are regarded 
as objects of veneration, which it would be 
sacrilegious to submit to the view of an in^ 
fidel. Naturally the conclusions drawn from 
these Persian sources differ a good deal from 
those generally accepted by Western students. 
Mr. Shirazi 's English style is clear and sim- 
ple, and his presentation of his points exceed- 
ingly interesting. His monograph, in its

dainty setting, will make a singularly appro- 
priate remembrance for the Omarites on one's 
Christmas list. 

Mrs. Fanny Y. Cory, whose delightful pic- 
tures of children are pleasantly and widely 
known, and Mr. Burges Johnson, whose 'lit- 
tle boy' verses reviewed elsewhere in this issue 
have interested the readers of the various 
Harper periodicals, have collaborated in the 
production of one of the most charming of 
the humorous holiday publications. 'The 
Pleasant Tragedies of Childhood' (Harper) 
are pictorially represented in over fifty full- 
page illustrations, each of which is accom- 
panied by an explanatory stanza in Mr. John- 
son's characteristically humorous style. From 
the First Baby's first nocturnal fit of scream- 
ing, which its fond but inexperienced mamma 
fails to attribute to that simplest of causes 
— a pin that pricks, to the three-year-old's 
Christmas tragedy, which consists in seeing his 
cousin get the rocking-horse that Santa Claus 
had faithfully promised him,— every picture 
and every verse is delightful. The small boy 
gets most attention, but little girls are not 
neglected. The First Baby's patronizing 
patience with its inexperienced young parents, 
as expressed in the verses, makes a delicious 
contrast with the helpless, round-eyed, and 
generally tearful infant of the pictures. Later 
on the tragedies brought about by brotherly 
and sisterly affection are delineated in a 
knowing fashion that will appeal to any per- 
son who did not have the misfortune to be 
an only child. 

He who finds in his Christmas stocking a 
copy of Sterne's 'Sentimental Journey' in the 
new Riverside Press edition may well feel 
something more than gratitude. He may justly 
consider that a rare compliment has been paid 
him as a discriminating bibliophile; for it is 
not everyone, not even every book-lover, that 
will be able to appreciate the real excellence 
of this reprint. Here are none of those showy 
surface features upon which most 'privately- 
printed' volumes depend to win favor,— no 
* Morris' type, no garish decorations, no colored 
illustrations, no elaborate cover. But those who 
can justly estimate the beauty of graceful and 
legible type correctly set, of luminous and even 
presswork, of fine handmade paper, of fitting 
and durable binding,— for such there is in every 
detail of this book a satisfying charm and dis- 
tinction. The volume is an octavo, similar in 
nearly all details to the edition of Fielding's 
'Voyage to Lisbon' brought out by the River- 
side Press three years ago. An appropriate lit- 
tle wood-cut vignette on the title-page is the 
only note of decoration in the book. Mr. Yorick 's 
narrative has been given many and various set- 
tings in its time, but never a worthier than this. 
Three hundred copies only are offered for sale 
by the publishers, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. 

This year, as heretofore, there comes from the 
press of Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. an amusing col- 
lection of those humoi'ous and whimsical book- 



lets for which these San Francisco publishers are 
noted. This year's output surpasses previous 
ones both in quality and quantity. It contains 
almost a dozen titles. 'The Blue Monday Book,' 
compiled and arranged by Jennie Day Haines, is 
appropriately bound in blue, with a touch of gold 
to symbolize the cheering character of its con- 
tents. There is a page of quotations for each 
blue Monday in the year, and a blue Monday 
must be very deeply dyed to withstand the cheer- 
ful t-ne of these carefully chosen extracts from 
a varied assortment of authors, from Dr. John- 
son and George Herbert to President Roosevelt 
and 'Mrs. Wiggs.'— 'The Matrimonial Primer' 
by Mr. V. B. Ames, with colored pictures and 
decorations by Mr. Gordon Ross, is a little man- 
ual designed primarily for the instruction of the 
newly wed, but capable of furnishing a good deal 
of amusement to the world at large. It contains 
some clever satire, a good deal of wholesome hu- 
mor, and plenty of sound common-sense. The 
wit sometimes falls to commonplaceness but never 
to anything more objectionable. The primer is 
appropriately bound in gingham with a poster 
label,— 'An Alphabet of History' is a diverting 
collection of verses by Mr, W. D. Nesbit, with 
accompanying illustrations by Mr. Ellsworth 
Young. Twenty-six historical personages, ranging 
from Methuselah to William Kidd and from Xan- 
tippe to Omar and Samuel Pepys, are portrayed 
with accuracy, completeness, and much clever- 
ness. The 'Alphabet' is printed on manila paper 
and bound in boards with a picture of Father 
Time on the cover, — The familiar and ever- wel- 
come 'Cynic's Calendar' by Ethel Watts Mum- 
ford, Oliver Herford, and Addison Mizner re- 
appears once more in its gingham binding. This 
1906 edition is better as a whole than any of its 
predecessors. The cream of the old 'twisted' 
proverbs has been retained, and the new ones 
are equal to the best of the old. In general form 
and style of decoration the new calendar is simi- 
lar to editions of past years,— 'The Joke Book 
Note Book,' designed by Ethel Watts Mum- 
ford, is intended as a pocket companion to take 
the place of that easily mislaid scrap of paper 
on which the man desirous of shining at his 
friends' dinner-table is wont to jot down the 
point of some elusive good story. In order that 
any particular story may be forthcoming at the 
right moment, a method of classification is sup- 
plied by a few succinct and comprehensive head- 
ings, such as 'Irish,' 'Ladies,' 'Sports,' 'Jingles,' 
etc. Under each heading is printed one good joke 
by way of a beginning. The headings and mar- 
gins are decorated, and the binding is attractive, 
so that the 'Joke Book Note Book' is ornamental 
as well as useful, — 'Sovereign Woman versus 
Mere Man' is an attractive medley of quotations 
comparing or contrasting the sexes. They are 
brought together and arranged under appropriate 
headings by Jennie Day Haines. Mr. Gordon Ross 
furnishes a very attractive frontispiece, and there 
are symbolic sketches in black and white on the 
margins and in gold on the paper cover. The 
quotations, which are of very miscellaneous au-

thorship, possess more than a superficial aptness, 
and there is a refreshing absence of that attempt 
at epiorrammatic smartness which spoils most 
books of this type.— 'Good Things and Graces' is 
a collection of thirty decidedly original recipes 
by Miss Isabel Goodhue. One of the three 
recipes for 'Greens' will serve to suggest Miss 
Goodhue's idea of a delectable menu. 'Budding 
hopes; shoots of new ideas; sprigs of self-confi- 
dence; tendrils of sentiment; flowers of poetry. 
This makes an excellent combination, and is an 
especially good diet for all persons over forty-five 
years of age. If you do not find the necessary 
ingredients in your own garden, cultivate them. 
You will never regret it.' Brown Betty, Poor 
Man's Pudding, Mayonnaise for Blue Monday 
Salad, and Elixir of Youth are some of the other 
dainties which Miss Goodhue teaches her readers 
to prepare. 'Good Things and Graces' is abso- 
lutely unique, and in both form and spirit it is 
a thorough -going holiday booklet.— 'A Child's 
Book of Abridged Wisdom,' written by 'Childe 
Harold' and ' affectionatelj' dedicated to the 
senior,' is a series of irresistibly comic verses 
containing good advice for the young. Here is 
one quatrain : 

'When near a row of corn, my dears, 
Take care what subjects you pursue. 
However harmless it appears, 
Remember that the corn has ears 
And may be listening to you.' 

The absurdity of the verses is enhanced by the 
illustrations in outline, which are quite as hu- 
morous as the text. Childe Harold's wisdom 
is of a decidedly precocious order ; his touch is so 
light and his pims so good — or so bad — that his 
elders will appreciate him better than his con- 
temporaries.— 'The Menehunes' by Emily Foster 
Day, with illustrations by Mr, Spencer Wright, is 
a booklet of rather different tjrpe from the fore- 
going. The Menehunes are the 'little people' of 
the Hawaiian forests, and this is the story of their 
adventure with a fisherman whom they fought 
for the rule of the woods. Illustrations and bor- 
der designs are in keeping with the tropical at- 
mosphere and mjiihical character of the tale, and 
a unique binding of native cloth stamped with a 
barbaric pattern completes the quaint and original 
effect.— Neither whimsical nor humorous, but in- 
tended like the rest of the Elder books to cater to 
th- -^ishes ot the holiday shopper in search of lit- 
tle books, is a dainty volume of lyrics by Mr. 
Charles G. Blanden, entitled 'A Chorus of Leaves.' 
Nature and love are the themes of Mr. Blanden 's 
verse. It strikes no lofty note, but it is singularly 
graceful in rhythm and dainty in conceit, and 
makes no pretension to be more. The parchment 
binding, a frontispiece from a landscape by Mr. 
William Keith, and generous margins give the 
little book a holiday air. 

Quite the prettiest among the less expensive 
holiday publications is the volume, published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., containing 
Bret Harte's poem ' Her Letter,' with its two 
companion pieces, ' His Answer ' and ' Her 
Last Letter.' For the present reprint, these 



old favorites have been literally, as the title- 
page has it, 'pictured' by Mr. Arthur I. Kel- 
ler. There are specially designed end-papers, 
a decorated title-page in color, and head-pieces 
and tail-pieces in every available space. In 
short, every opportunity for decoration has been 
made the most of, and each smallest design is 
charming and entirely appropriate. The illus- 
trations, a few more in number than the stan- 
zas, are in color or in tint, some from wash- 
drawings and others from pen-and-ink sketches. 
They catch both the himior and the sentiment 
of the verses, and the artist has not forgotten 
that the life of Poverty Flat is now a full gen- 
eration behind us. ' Her Letter ' is certainly 
one of the artistic triumphs of the season's out- 
put. 

Two very beautiful holiday editions with Mr. 
Howard Pyle's illustrations as the principal 
decorative feature have been issued by Messrs. 
Harper and Brothers. The more attractive of 
the two, if there is a choice, as well as the 
more fully illustrated, is ' The Line of Love,' 
a series of seven stories of mediaeval romance 
by Mr. James Branch Cabell. The tales have 
been culled from old French romans and dull 
English chronicles, and the mediaeval atmos- 
phere has been preserved by the quaintly, 
though never obscurely, archaic style of narra- 
tion. Ten pictures and a cover vignette by Mr. 
Pyle, richly colored and conceived in a vividly 
imaginative style perfectly in keeping with the 
literary atmosphere, together with conventional 
floral borders in color, make a singularly at- 
tractive gift-book. — A dainty violet cover, rather 
too ornate, suggestive page decorations, and 
four full-page illustrations in color, similar in 
style to those in the other volume, ornament 
'The Island of Enchantment,' Mr. Justus Miles 
Forma n's charming story of mediaeval Venice. 
Mr. Forman knows how to mingle love, war, 
and intrigue in a way to compel his reader's 
interest, and he has never succeeded better 
than in this novelette, which is good enough 
fully to justify the pains that have been taken 
by the publishers for its embellishment. 

A novelty in garden-books seems almost im- 
possible, but it has been provided by Blanche 
Elizabeth Wade, whose 'Garden in Pink' is 
among the holiday publications of Messrs. A. 
C. McClurg & Co. Twelve little photographs, 
daintily printed on thin paper and mounted 
on separate pages, show some of the beauties 
of the garden, while headings and occasional 
borders in color designed by Lucy Fitch Per- 
kins ornament the pages. The 'Pink Garden' 
was made over from an Italian garden, whose 
clipped yews made a quaint background for 
the novel color scheme. It was all pink even 
to the gardener, whose name was changed from 
plain John Brown to Giovanni Pincolini to 
match his new surroundings. And as the flow- 
ers that were unfortunate enough not to be 
pink must have attention, the rest of the gar- 
den space was named 'Vibgyor'— that is, the 
\dolet - indigo - blue-green-yellow-orange-and-red- 
garden,— and there was also the small 'Find-

THE DIAX. 



[Dec. 1, 



Out' garden, where things which might pos- 
sibly come up pink could be tried. All these 
gardens have their place in the story, as has 
the 'Garden Room' for rainy days. The essen- 
tial human interest is furnished by the gar- 
dener, his wife, the two owners of the garden, 
and a summer guest known as 'the Prevari- 
cator' because she wrote stories, and belong- 
ing in the 'Pink Garden' book because she is 
given to seeing gardens and other matters in 
a rose-colored light. 'The Garden in Pink' will 
fill all its readers with a desire for a pink 
garden,— and next best to having one is to 
read about this one. 

A book that will be particularly welcome to 
those who are contemplating a visit to Lon- 
don's art treasures, but one that has also 
plenty to offer the general reader, is 'The 
Art of the National Gallery,' a critical study 
of the paintings included in that great collec- 
tion, by Miss Julia de Wolf Addison, author 
of several works of similar scope. A plan of 
the gallery, showing the location of the dif- 
ferent schools, follows the index. The pic- 
tures are discussed in the text as they are 
himg,— that is, according to schools in their 
historic order; but of course the limitation 
in space and particularly in number of illus- 
trations precludes this manual's being a com- 
plete history of any school. It is rather a 
guide to the treasures of the gallery, almost 
every picture being at least briefly mentioned. 
Miss Addison spent her early life in Eng- 
land, and is thoroughly familiar with her 
ground. Her method is descriptive rather 
than technically critical,— which is decidedly 
the popular method. Nearly fifty illustrations 
in duo-gravure elucidate Miss Addison's points, 
and together with a very handsome cover help 
to make an exceedingly attractive book. It is 
published in Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.'s series 
of guides to 'The Art Galleries of Europe.' 

'Two in Italy' is the name which Maud 
Howe (Mrs. John Elliott) gives to her new 
volume of Italian sketches. The other one of 
the 'two' is of course Mr. Elliott, whose draw- 
ings furnish material for half a dozen apposite 
illustrations. Mrs. Elliott 's Italian reminiscences 
are the fruit of an intimate acquaintance with 
the country and its people — an acquaintance 
rendered profitable by a keen and humorous 
appreciation of any situation, however com- 
monplace it may appear on its surface. The 
chapters of her new book stand on that de- 
lightful middle ground between the short story 
and the expository sketch. They are not ham- 
pered by plot, but the human interest — which 
is essentially the story interest — is predom- 
inant, and the form is loosely narrative. 
Readers of 'Roma Beata' will enjoy this sec- 
ond volume, which, though of slightly different 
type, is equally permeated by Mrs. Elliott's 
individual and entertaining point of view. 
(Little, Brown, & Co.) 

'Romance of the French Abbeys' (Putnam) 
is the fourth volume that Mrs. Elizabeth W. 
Champney has given us, as the result of her 



researches in the fascinating field of French le- 
gend. The French chateaux, feudal, renaissance, 
and Bourbon, have been made to yield up their 
treasures of association; and now the French 
abbeys prove to be equally abounding in tales 
of chivalrous gallantry and religious or patriotic 
fervor. Fifteen legends, sacred and secular, 
related in easy, narrative style, make up the 
new volume, which is bound uniformly with 
the others and liberally illustrated, in photo- 
gravure and half-tone, with pictures of the 
abbeys and their art-treasures. Some of the 
itineraries that Mrs. Champney found partic- 
ularly pleasant, among the abbeys of Provence^ 
Burgundy, Isle de France, and Normandy, are 
outlined in the last chapter; but Mrs. Champ- 
ney warns her readers that they must go 
quickly, for even the ruins of the abbeys are 
fast vanishing. 

We have come to expect an annual holiday vol- 
ume of Mr. Paul Laurence Dunbar's negro melo- 
dies, and this year is no exception to the rule. 
The title-verse of the new collection is 'Howdy, 
Honey, Howdy.' The illustrations are from pho- 
tographs by Leigh Richmond Miner, and the mar- 
ginal and cover decorations are by Mr. Will Jen- 
kins, who makes a pretty setting, but a rather 
soberer one than those that Miss Margaret Arm- 
strong has provided for several years past. The 
illustrations, on the other hand, are less glaringly 
realistic than usual, and the negro portraits and 
groups are pleasantly varied by a number of 
charming southern landscapes. Mr. Dunbar's 
part in the volume needs no description, save to 
say that it is in his characteristic vein and well 
up to his usual standard in quality. (Dodd, Mead 
& Co.) 

Another delightful collection of negro verse is 
'Banjo Talks' (Bobbs-Merrill Co.), by Mrs. Anne 
Virginia Culbertson. These lyrics, many of which 
have previously appeared in the magazines, are a 
real addition to our stock of negro melodies. 
Showing very little of the philosophical temper 
that makes Mr. Dunbar's work unique, and being 
considerably less perfect in dialect, they have to 
their credit a decided imaginative quality, much 
picturesqueness of diction, and a charming spon- 
taneity of conception and treatment. A stanza 
from 'De Wood-Hants' will serve as illustration: 
'Wen de moon serouch down behime de hill 

An' de dark fol' roun' you clost an' still. 
Keep outer de wood, 
Ef you know w'at's good, 

Fer dey's things in dar dat nuver show 

'Twel de dark come on an' de daylight go, 

An' dey races an' runs, an' dey flars an' flants,. 

An' de name er dem creeturs is hants, chile^ 
hantsl ' 

The illustrations are from photographs, which 
show considerable artistic skill in their avoidance 
01 stilted posing and in the blurred softness which 
t^nes down the crudity that seems to be almost 
inseparable from negro portraiture. The cover 
is simple and of good design. 

Almost ten years ago and long before the ad- 
vent of Pastor Wagner's 'Simple Life,' President 
Eliot of Harvard College published a little book 



1905.] 



THE DIAL 



387 



called 'The Happy Life,' a plea for much the 
same sort of plain IhTug and high thinking. This 
is now re-issued in a holiday edition (Crowell), 
daintily bound in green and gold, printed with 
rubricated initials and headings, and having as 
frontispiece a photogravure portrait of the au- 
thor. 'The Happy Life' is intended to show 
young people in particular how to make the most 
of the blessings that are within the reach of aU, 
— friends, books, the outdoor world, the power to 
think wisely and to serve one's fellows. The 
points are concrete and practical, and the style 
is very simple, with a ring of nobility and sin- 
cerity about it that is worth more than many 
epigrams. — From the same publishers and very 
similar in spirit is the 'Emerson Calendar' com- 
piled by Mr. Huntington Smith. Print and paper 
are attractive, and a fine portrait of the Concord 
sage serves as frontispiece. The preface claims 
for Emerson the honor of haAring been tha orig- 
inator, as well as the most inspired exponent, of 
the much discussed 'Simple Life'; and the quota- 
tions, one for each day in the year, are chosen to 
exemplify Emerson's wide philosophy of life and 
the wisdom and poise with which he viewed its 
joys and obligations. This 'Emerson Calendar' 
ought to give a happy holiday and a happy year 
to its recipient. 

An interesting and comprehensive, though 
distinctly popular, study of Biblical art has 
been made by Miss Estelle M. HurU in her 
volume called 'The Bible Beautiful,' published 
in a fully illustrated edition by Messrs. L. C. 
Page & Co. The book aims to trace the de- 
velopment of Bible illustration from the crude 
pictures of the catacombs to the splendid art 
of the mediaeval mosaics, cathedral facades, 
stained glass windows, and mural frescoes, and 
finally to the modem work, mostly English, 
of the last two centuries. Three special in- 
dices are prorided: one of Artists, for the art 
student; one of Places, for the tourist; and 
one of Bible Subjects, for Bible students. The 
general explanation afforded by the text is supn 
plemented by three appendices which contain 
selections from mediaeval literature dealing with 
art origins. About fifty half-tones of various 
types of sacred art ornament and elucidate the 
text. 

The late Mr. Paul Leicester Ford was partic- 
ularly apt at writing that type of short story 
which any young man, in search of a Christmas 
gift for the lady of his choice, instantly seizes 
upon as appropriate. This year the young gen- 
tleman will find his problem solved by a holi- 
day edition of * His Version of It,' that pretty 
romance of by-gone days which old Reveille, the 
veteran of the stable, relates to his equine 
companions. Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. publish 
the book, with colored page borders, cleverly 
composed of romantic emblems, and half a 
dozen colored illustrations by Mr. Henry Hutt. 

The publishers of the 'Thumb Nail Series' 
(Century Co.) display a really remarkable 
facility in choosing for reprint works that are 
suitable to the bibelot form and that will fit 



the varied tastes and needs of the Christmas 
shopper. Three new volumes for the current 
year are Mrs. Browning's 'Sonnets from the 
Portuguese,' with a few miscellaneous poems 
by both Mr. and Mrs. Browning, and con- 
taining as an introduction the interesting essay 
by Mr. Richard Watson Gilder recently pub- 
lished in the 'Century Magazine'; 'The 
Chimes,' Charles Dickens's delightful gobliu 
story for the New Year; and a volume con- 
taining five of "Washington's greatest ad- 
dresses and letters, with W. E. H. Lecky's 
sketch of "Washington's character as an in- 
troduction. Mrs. Blanche McManus Mansfield's 
cover designs, executed in embossed leather, 
are as original and suitable as the 'Thumb 
Xail' covers always are. The Browning and 
"Washington volumes have portrait frontispieces, 
and 'The Chimes' an illustrative one. 

A popular illustrated reprint of 'Ramona,' 
with the pictures and decorative headings by 
Mr. Henry Sandham that appeared in the 
two-volume edition of several years ago, has 
been issued by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., 
under the name of the 'Pasadena' edition. It 
will be recalled that Mr. Sandham accom- 
panied Mrs. Jackson on her trip among the 
California Missions in search of material for 
'Ramona,' and that it was her plan to have 
him illustrate the book, which she always re- 
ferred to as 'ours.' His part, however, was 
not completed until seventeen years after the 
publication of the story. The 'Pasadena' edi- 
tion is well printed and handsomely bound, 
being a popular but not in any sense a cheap 
edition. 

'Her Memory Book,* designed by Miss Helen 
Hayes and published by Messrs. Harper & Broth- 
ers, is intended for a Oiristmas offering upon the 
shrine of the popular debutante. Daintily bound 
in violet and gold, decorated with lover's knots, 
cupids, and roses, its blank pages await the rec- 
ords of my lady 's social triumphs from her debut 
to its natural sequel, her wedding. There is a 
page for her portrait, and others for samples of 
her favorite dresses and for newspaper clippings 
about her. There is space for entries about the 
sports she enjoys in each season, about her trav- 
els, and her particularly exciting shopping tours. 
Here she can preserve lists of the affairs given 
in her honor and of all the dozen varieties of di- 
version with which she fills her days and nights. 
The page headings and borders are so pretty and 
so clever that even a debutante without a taste 
for collecting memorabilia— if such an one can be 
found— will like to own and fill out this memory 
book. 

Eighteen years have elapsed since the publica- 
tion of Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton's 'Famous Ameri- 
can Authors,' and now the Messrs. CroweU offer 
the essays anew in a handsomely bound volume 
with two dozen illustrations portraying in fine 
half-tone reproductions the persons and the homes 
of six representatives of the old New England 
school. A great deal has been written about the 
lives of Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, "Whit-

tier, Lowell, and Holmes, but Mrs. Bolton's nar- 
rative has nevertheless a decidedly attractive 
ring. She manages to tell the familiar facts in a 
genial, lively way, interlarding them with anec- 
dotes or personal impressions, and making her 
main theme in every case the essential quality of 
the author discussed. This reprint seems timely 
in the midst of the flood of writing that threatens 
to engulf our small output of really good litera- 
ture, and particularly in view of a recent tend- 
ency to underrate the New England school at 
least as vigorously as its contemporaries over- 
rated it. 

Fourteen years ago Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. issued an illustrated edition of three of 
Oliver Wendell Holmes's humorous poems: 'The 
Deacon's Masterpiece,' *How the Old Horse Won 
the Bet, ' and * The Broomstick Train, ' with illus- 
trations in black-and-white by Mr. Howard Pyle. 
These publishers now offer a new edition of the 
book,— which is entitled 'The One-Hoss Shay,' — 
with the original illustrations re-drawn in color 
by the artist. Mr. Pyle's humorous vein, which 
most of his admirers consider undoubtedly his 
most characteristic and delightful vein, could 
nowhere find better material for interpretation 
than that which Dr. Holmes's genial wit fur- 
nishes. The choice between black-and-white and 
color is largely a personal one; it is enough to 
say that the new edition is delightful. Dr. 
Holmes's preface for the 1891 edition has been 
retained, and a note by the publishers speaks of 
the hearty approval he gave to Mr. Pyle's orig- 
inal drawings. 

The volume entitled 'Saddle and Song' is, as 
its name suggests, a compilation of verse about" 
horses. It is published by the Lippincott Co., the 
editor's name being withheld. Every type of 
horse,— the Arab steed, the equine hero of myth 
and romance, the clean-limbed racer, the Aus- 
tralian drover's pony, the steeple-chase favorite, 
the horse ridden for idle pleasure, and the horse 
ridden to a glorious death,— all find their pane- 
gyrists within these covers, so that every reader 
should be able to find a horse or a rider to his 
liking. There is one respect in which the collec- 
tion is incomplete, but the editor forestalls criti- 
cism by expressing his regret that he could find no 
satisfactory tribute to the western cow-pony's 
prowess, except a few copyrighted pieces. Some 
old favorites are missing, doubtless for the same 
reason; but within its limits the collection is a 
good one. There are a number of illustrations 
from paintings and photographs, and the general 
make-up of the book is attractive. 

Mr. George Alfred Williams, illustrator of the 
Baker and Taylor Company's holiday edition of 
Dickens 's ' Christmas Carol ' and ' The Cricket on 
the Hearth, ' has had the temerity to depart from 
the traditional method of picturing Dickens's 
characters. As he explains in a prefatory note, 
he has tried to bring out the more human elements 
of the characterizations, instead of the grotesque 
and exaggerated comedy that appealed to Leech 
and other contemporary illustrators. There are 



five pictures for each story, and while they can- 
not of course compare in strength and originality 
with Leech 's work, we tliink that readers who are 
not wedded to the old tradition will like them 
very much, particularly younger readers, who are 
always repelled by the frank ugliness of the early 
illustrations. The volume is of quarto size, well 
made and printed. The cover has a quaint, old- 
time look that is very attractive. 

'Caroline of Courtlandt Street' (Harper) is a 
slight but spirited novelette by Mr, Weymer Jay 
Mills. Its plot is laid in the year 1824, when 
Courtlandt street was a synonym for aristocratic 
exclusiveness in New York, and when the Park 
Theatre was still in its prime. 'Lady Caroline' 
belongs to Courtlandt Street through her father's 
family, but because her mother was 'the darling 
of the old Park,' Courtlandt Street disowns her. 
Being an ambitious as well as a charming young 
person, she resolves to conquer both of her heredi- 
tary domains; and the novel tells how she did it 
and why she stopped. Half a dozen very dainty 
colored pictures by Miss Anna Whelan Betts, a 
series of over-elaborate page borders by Mr. W. 
E. Mears, and an ornate cover make a distinc- 
tively holiday setting for this pretty story. 

Another attractive holiday novelette is Mr. 
Ralph Henry Barbour's 'An Orchard Princess' 
(Lippincott). This is a story of today, the ac- 
tion taking place in 'Maple Green,' an artists' 
colony somewhere near New York. The wooing 
of the orchard princess is exceedingly entertain- 
ing, for the princess has a mind of her own and 
the hero shows much ingenuity in making it up 
according to his wishes. The artist colony life 
furnishes a good background, and Bistre, the 
hero's bull-dog, is an interesting factor of the 
situation. The decorative setting is charming. 
Mr. James Montgomery Flagg has made four 
colored plates, and his chapter-headings and 
marginal drawings are artistic i^nd perfectly in 
keeping with the story. A vignette of the prin- 
cess, with a spray of apple-blossoms below it, set 
in a plain green background is the dainty and 
appropriate cover design. 

Readers of 'Scribner's Magazine' for the cur- 
rent vear have been enjoying Mr, F, Hopkinson 
Smith's chapters about the painter MacWhirter 
and his circle of friends. Every month or so they 
have gathered around 'The Wood Fire in No, 3,' 
— 'No. 3' being MacWhirter 's attic studio,— to 
exchange greetings and stories of the mysterious 
or humorous or romantic adventures that they 
have encountered in various odd corners of 
the earth. These stories are now gathered into 
a volume, taking its title from the fire that in- 
spired them, and illustrated in colors by Mr. 
Alonzo Kimball, MacWhirter and his friends 
are thoroughly individual, but all alike endowed 
with the kindly Bohemian spirit of good-comrade- 
ship that is supposed to be characteristic of the 
artist profession. They all know stories well 
worth the telling, and they tell them extremely 
well. While not of a distinctively Christmas 
flavor, the 'Wood Fire' stories are full of a holi-

day spirit of good fellowship and good cheer, and 
'The Wood Fire in No. 3' (Scribner) will make 
an excellent Christmas gift. 

'The Poet, Miss Kate, and I' is one of those 
little idyls of Arcadian life in country solitudes 
that are just now enjoying a large measure of 
popular favor. It is written^ like many of its 
predecessors, in diary form, the hero and hero- 
ine taking turns in confiding their respective 
emotions and points of view to the reader. Miss 
Kate is a horse, the fast friend and constant 
companion of the heroine, and just as impor- 
tant in the story as is the confidante in eight- 
eenth century comedy. The plot is slight, but 
the nature sketches, the character study, and a 
very piquant way of putting things, give the 
book a decided charm. This type of story lends 
itself well to a decorative edition, and the 
Baker & Taylor Co. issue this example in pretty 
holiday dress with green page borders, colored 
frontisioieee, and an unusually artistic cover. 

So small as to be valuable chiefly as a curi- 
osity is Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s 'Minia- 
ture Edition' of "Washington Irving 's selected 
works. The five tiny bibelots, in size 2^ by 
ll^ inches, are bound in limp ooze leather, 
clearly printed on gilt-edged India paper, and 
slipped into a leather case that matches the 
covers. We have had pocket volumes before, 
but this is literally a pocket edition. The 
volumes contain four stories from 'The Sketch 
Book,' seven of the 'Christmas Sketches,' 
four legends from 'The Alhambra,' and ten 
selections from 'Bracebridge Hall.' They can 
be read comfortably, though one's fingers tend 
to become all thumbs in handling anything 
quite so tiny. 

'Womanhood in Art' (Paul Elder & Co.) is the 
rather unpropitious and very indeterminate title 
of a thin quarto volume by Mrs. Phebe Estelle 
Spalding. It consists, in fact, of reproductions 
and brief interpretations of six great artistic con- 
ceptions of ideal womanhood : the Venus de Milo, 
Dagonet's Eve, Mona Lisa, Beatriee Cenci, the 
Madonna of the Chair, and the Sistine Madonna. 
Tl^e reproductions, which are in tint, are excel- 
lent, and print, paper, and grey board covers are 
attractive. The text is intended neither for artists 
nor students of painting, but for the ordinary ob- 
server who is interested merely in the moral sig- 
nificance of the picture, caring nothing for its 
history or technique. Such criticism leans inevi- 
tably towards the fanciful and the sentimental, 
but it doubtless appeals to a certain class of read- 
ers. 

'Rhymes of Little Boys' (Crowell) is the at- 
tractive title of a small volume of verse by Mr. 
Burges Johnson. The 'RhjTiies' are bound 
in plaid gingham, with decorated end-papers 
and title pasre. 'Goin' Barefoot,' 'Bein' Sick,' 
' Gettin' Well,' ' Buildin' Fires,' ' Cookin' 
Things,' 'Ketchin' Rides,' ' Pirates' Cave,' 
' Nurses,' and numerous other matters of vital 
interest to all small boys and their friends are 
treated with an understanding touch and much 
real humor. A few verses written from the 
grown-up point of view are included in the col- 



lection. Mr. Johnson's * little boy ' rhymes are 
already well known to magazine readers. This 
volume is sure to win for its author a wider 
appreciation of his really unique work. 

'A Corner in Women and Other Follies' 
(Moffat, Yard & Co.) is the title of an amus- 
ing collection of Mr. Tom Masson's stories, 
epigrams, anecdotes, and skits. All the 
'follies' are clever, and there is plenty of 
variety in both subject and manner of treat- 
ment. One of Mr. Gibson's drawings makes 
a most effective cover design, and another 
serves as frontispiece. The rest of the illus- 
trations and decorations are by Gilbert, Kem- 
ble, Raymond Crosby, and half a dozen more 
of 'Life's' favorite illustrators. 

Motor fiends and motor haters can forget 
their quarrels and join in a hearty laugh over 
'Auto Fun' (Crowell), a collection of skits and 
drawings from the witty pages of 'Life.' Being 
the cream of 'Life's' opinions upon the subject, 
they are all clever and to the point. Here every 
scorcher will find his mishaps turned to jest, and 
his adventures and aspirations pictured in a fash- 
ion that he cannot resent and that will none the 
less rejoice the hearts of his enemies and victims. 
'Auto Fun,' with its novel cover design and 
abundance of real humor on a vital issue of the 
year, is sure to be a favorite with holiday buyers, 
who will like to take a subtle revenge upon their 
auto-owning friends by presenting them with this 
token of appreciation. 

'Songs o' Cheer' is the title of a new col- 
lection of Mr. James Whitcomb Riley's verse, 
published by the Bobbs-Merrill Company in 
a volume copiously illustrated by Mr. Will 
Vawter. The verses include some copyrighted 
as early as 1883, and others published as late 
as 1905. There is a good deal of common- 
place work in the book, but there ace also 
bits here and there of Mr. Riley at his best. 
The cheerful tone of the volume and its dec- 
orative features will appeal to holiday shoppers. 

'The Days and Hours of Raphael' (Grafton 
Press), by Mrs. Rachel A. La Fontaine, is a little 
manual of art study, substantially bound, copi- 
ously illustrated, and intended for the tyro in 
matters aesthetic. The full-page plates in half- 
tone, including, besides the seven 'Days' and the 
twelve 'Hours,' two portraits of Raphael, are of 
excellent quality. The accompanying notes of 
explanation are very elementary, presupposing 
little knowledge of art or mythology on the part 
of the reader. It is a pity, considering her effort 
for simplicity, that the author does not couch her 
ideas in less obscure and tortuously constructed 
sentences. 

Mary Allette Ayer, who last year com- 
piled a 'Daily Cheer Year Book,' this season 
edits 'The Joys of Friendship' (Lothrop, Lee 
& Shepard Co.), a similar collection of quoted 
passages. The extracts are arranged under six 
sub-headings, treating as many different phases 
of the subject. A forget-me-not heart on a 
white ground makes a dainty and suitable 
cover for this pretty gilt-book.

ume to his successful little anthology, 'The Open 
Road.' The new book is called 'The Friendly

city life. 

'Carnations, Picotees, and the Wild and Garden 
Pinks,' is a work written by several hands, and 
edited by Mr. E. T. Cook, now published in the 
'Country Life Library,' imported by the Messrs.

The Chicago Library Club publishes a little 
handbook of 'Libraries of the City of Chicago,' ac- 
companied by an interesting historical sketch of 
the organization and work of the Club. The book 
is illustrated. 

Mr. T. Fisher Unwin, London, publishes a book 
by Mr. A. Harold Unwin, entitled 'Future Forest 
Trees,' being a discussion of 'the importance of the 
German experiments in the introduction of North 
American trees.' 

Mr. Theodore Watts Dunton's new novel 'Car- 
niola' will be published during the winter in Eng- 
land and America by Messrs. Harpers. The story 
is laid partly in England, partly in Venice, and 
partly in Hungary. 

The volume of 'Lectures on Shakespeare' by 
Dr. Stopford Brooke, to be published in this coun- 
try by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., will deal with 
ten of the principal dramas in a spirit of apprecia- 
tion rather than analysis. 

'The Latin Poets' is a new anthology edited by 
Mr, Nathan Haskell Dole, and published by the 
Messrs. Crowell. Seventeen poets are represented, 
from Plautus to Lucan, and a great variety of 
translators are drawn upon for the matter selected. 
A new volume soon to appear in the 'Temple 
Classics' series will consist of a selection and trans- 
lation from Indian Poetry made by Mr. Romesh 
Chundra Dutt, who rendered the ' Mahabharata ' 
and 'Ramayana' into English verse for the same 
series. 

'The Elements of Business Law,' with illustrative 
examples and problems, is a text -book by Mr. Ernest 
W. Huffcot, published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. in 
response to the demand created] by the introduction 
of commercial courses into our secondary school 
curricula. 

In 'The Life of Kate Greenaway,' by Messrs. M. 
H. Spielmann and G. S. Layard, which will at once 
be published by the Messrs. Putnam, the history 
of Kate Greenaway 's long friendship with Ruskin 
is told and their correspondence printed, including 



some fifty of Ruskin 's letters hitherto unpublished. 
Many of the accompanying illustrations by Kate 
Greenaway have also been reproduced for the first 
time. 

Mr. Charles Dexter Allen's authoritative work on. 
'American Book-Plates' is published by the Mac- 
millan Co. in a handsome new edition. The text 
seems to be unchanged. Numerous reproductions of 
rare and interesting book-plates illustrate the vol- 
ume. 

Mrs. Paget Toynbee's definitive edition of 
Horace Walpole's Letters will be completed this 
autumn. The last volume — the sixteenth — is 
almost filled by indexes to persons, places, and 
subjects, which will be invaluable as a key to the 
treasure-house. 

Four new volumes of the 'Caxton' series are im- 
ported by the Messrs. Scribner. They are as fol- 
lows: 'Songs and Lyrics from the Dramatists, 1533- 
1777', 'The Poems of Thomas Gray and William 
Collins ', ' The Novels of Laurence Sterne ', and ' The 
Imitation of Christ' in John Payne's translation. 

'The Industrial History of the United States, 
for High Schools and College,' by Miss- Katharine 
Coman, is published by the Macmillan Co. It 
supplements in a highly interesting way the or- 
dinary narrative text-book, and will prove a val- 
uable adjunct in the teaching of the subject. 

It is announced that beginning with the new 
year the two periodicals, 'Country Life in America' 
and 'The Country Calendar,' will be consolidated, 
appearing with the imprint of Doubleday, Page & 
Co. This same firm is soon to issue the first num- 
ber of an illustrated monthly periodical devoted to 
farming. 

Dr. Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer has undertaken to 
prepare for Messrs, George W. Jacobs & Co. an 
exhaustive 'Literary History of Philadelphia and 
its Neighborhood,' in which the prominent literary 
figures and landmarks of Philadelphia and the ad- 
joining counties will be thoroughly described and 
discussed. 

A volume containing the 'Child's Garden' and 
'Underwoods' has been added by Messrs. Herbert 
B. Turner & Co. to their pretty edition of Steven- 
sou. A photogravure reproduction of Saint-Gau- 
dens's medallion is included as frontispiece, and a 
small vignette of ' The Manse ' appears on the 
title-page. 

A volume of essays by Sir Lewis Morris will be 
published shortly by Messrs. Longmans, Greeny & 
Co., under the collective title of 'The New Ramb- 
ler,' This same firm has in preparation a new 
volume by the anonymous author of 'A Life of 
Sir Kenelm Digby,' to be entitled 'Pryings among 
Private Papers. ' 

A handsome moderate-priced reprint of William 
Morris's 'The Earthly Paradise' is sent us by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. There are four 
volumes in the set, the first containing a fine photo- 
gravure portrait of Morris and a brief preface by 
Mr. J. W. Mackail, It is a distinct boon to have 
Morris's great poem in so beautiful and convenient 
an edition. 

Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co. publish a small 
volume of 'Bible History' by Pastor Xavier Koenig, 
which presents some of the results of modem his- 
torical criticism of the Old Testament. M. Koenig

Protestant religious movement which is now being 
carried on in France. The translation of this book 
is by Miss Mary Louise Hendee.

THE DIAL,

'The Melody of God's Love,' which is a volume 
of sermonizing on the twenty-third psalm by Mr. 
Oliver Huckel, is published as a pretty little book 
by the Messrs. Crowell. From the same author and 
publisher comes 'Lohengrin,' which is a versifica- 
tion of the story of "Wagner's music-drama. 

Volume in. of Dr. George M, Gould's 'Bio- 
graphic Clinics, ' published by . Messrs. P. Blakis- 
ton's Son & Co., continues the author's discussion 
of 'the influence of visual function, pathologic and 
physiologic, upon the health of patients.' Symonda 
and Taine supply the present volume with its illus- 
trations of Dr. Gould's thesis. 

'The Complete Poetical Works of Lord Byron' 
form a new volume of the 'Cambridge' edition of 
poets, published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. Byron, in a single volume, with modern edit- 
ing, has long been a desideratum, and the ne«d is 
now happily supplied. There are a full thousand 
pages of poems, besides the biographical sketch and 
the notes. The volume is edited by Mr. Paul 
Elmer More. 

'Sea Shore Life,' by Dr. Alfred Goldsborough 
Mayer, an illustrated popular description of the 
invertebrates of the Xew York and adjacent coast, 
will be published at once by Messrs. A. S. Barnes 
& Co. This is the first volume of the 'New York 
Aquarium Nature Series,' prepared under the aus- 
pices of the New York Zoological Society, with an 
introductory note by Charles H. Townsend, Director 
of the New York Aquarium. 

'The Broadbent Treasuries,' a series of tiny 
anthologies that has met with much success in 
England, are now offered to American readers by 
the Broadbent Press of Philadelphia. • There are 
four volumes in the set, — 'A Treasury of Love,' 
'A Bussell Lowell Treasury,' 'An Emerson Treas- 
ury,' and 'A Treasury of Love.' The editing seems 
to have been done with taste, the form is neat and 
attractive, and the volumes are issued at a remark- 
ably low price. 

This being the centennial year of the birth of 
William Lloyd Garrison, we commend the timeliness 
of a little book of brief selections from his writ- 
ings, now published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. 'The Words of Garrison' is the title, and 
the book is dedicated 'to all who hate cruelty, 
oppression, and war, and believe in the equal rights 
and perfectibility of mankind.' Besides the selected 
passages, the volume contains a biography of Gar- 
rison, and a bibliography. 

The Oliver Ditson Co. have just added to their 
'Musician's Library' a volume of 'Seventy Scot- 
tish Songs,' edited by Miss Helen Hopekirk. This 
is a very interesting and valuable work, made so by 
the wide range of the selections, the careful trans- 
lations of the Gaelic text, and the artistic accom- 
paniments prepared by the editor. An essay on 
'Scotch Folk Songs' serves as introduction, and 
the frontispiece portrait is of the editor. 

A useful guide and handbook to the Italian and 
Spanish paintings in the Louvre, by Dr. Arthur 
Mahler, is published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
& Co. Since this gallery contains representations 
from nearly every painter of these two schools, the 
book may serve also as a biographical dictionary 
of artists. The criticism is of the old school, 
Vasari's pleasing tales being repeated with an ap- 
parent obli\'iousness of the incredulity into which 
they have fallen through the researches of such- 
moderns as Berenson, Fry, and others. 



The American Book Co. publishes 'Essentials in 
English History,' by Mr. Albert Perry Walker, and 
'Essentials in American History,' by Professor 
Albert Bushnell Hart. These text-books belong in 
the series of four volumes needed to cover the 
secondary-school course in history as generally 
adopted in the better schools of the country. The 
volume on ancient history in this series was pub- 
lished two or three years ago, and the volume on 
mediaeval and modern history will soon appear. 

The publication of eight new volumes in the 
'Biographical' edition of Bobert Louis Stevenson 
brings to a conclusion a set of books that all lovers 
of this much-loved writer will wish to have on their 
shelves. The text is of course complete and authori- 
tative, and the general form of the volumes makes 
them much more convenient for actual reading pur- 
poses than either of the two expensive subscription 
editions. The prefaces contributed by Mrs. Steven- 
son to several of the volumes are always interesting, 
and often throw a new ray of light on 'R. L. S.' 
and his work. Messrs. Scribners are the publishers. 

The volume by Miss G, E. Mitton on 'Jane 
Austen and her Times,' to be published shortly by 
the Messrs. Putnam, wiU endeavor to depict the 
writer among the scenes wherein she moved, to 
sketch the men and women to whom she was accus- 
tomed, the habits and manners of her class, and 
the England with which she was familiar. Some 
interesting reproductions from contemporary en- 
g^vings and paintings will illustrate the book- In 
connection with Miss Mitton 's work may be men- 
tioned the forthcoming account of 'Jane Austen's 
Sailor Brothers' by Mr. J. H. Hubback, and the 
new and cheaper edition of Miss Constance Hill's 
'Jane Austen, her Homes and her Friends,' both of 
which will be published soon by the John Lane Co. 

'Facts and Fancies for the Carious from the 
Harvest-Fields of Literature,' compiled by Dr. 
Charles C. Bombaugh, is a recent publication of the 
J. B. Lippimeott Co. It is a substitute for a similar 
work made by the same compiler about thirty years 
ago, the plates of which were destroyed in the 
Lippincott fire of 1899. It is impossible to describe 
such a work as this except in some such terms as 
the editor's 'a melange of excerpta.' It contains 
a great deal of curious information, which would 
also be useful if one only knew where to find it. 
But the total amount of curious information is so 
vastly greater than the amount compressible within 
a single volume that a book of this type is more 
useful for random reading than for reference pur- 
poses. 

The wonderful possibilities of the Oxford India 
paper are given new illustration in two books re- 
centlv published by Mr. Henry Frowde for the 
Clarendon Press. The first of these is a single- 
volume reprint of the 'Oxford' edition of Boswell's 
Johnson, originally issued a year ago in two vol- 
umes. The text is based on Malone's edition of 
1799, and there is no new editorial matter, .We 
are so accustomed to BosweU in three or four stout 
volumes that it is difficult to reconcile him with 
this single trim little duodecimo. Even more re- 
markable is the new 'Oxford' edition of Shakes- 
peare, in which the complete works are presented 
in a clearly-printed volume no larger than an ordi- 
nary novel. A preface, index to characters, and 
glossary are contributed by Mr. W. J. Craig. All 
the details of printing and binding are in perfect 
taste, and the edition seems to us the ideal single- 
volume Shakespeare.

THE BASSES: 

Fresh-Water and Marine 

By WILLIAM C. HaRRIS, DR. TARLBTON H. 
BEAN and Others 
Edited by LOUIS RHEAD, with numerous illus- 
trations in colors and black and white, and a 
specially decorated cover, by the editor. 

A new book by the editor of "The Speckled Brook 
Trout," which was pronounced by the press and such 
well-known anglers and writers as Mr. Cleveland, Dr. 
van Dyke, and Dr. Weir Mitchell, the most beautiful 
angling book heretofore issued, and which received for its 
drawings and manufacture a gold medal at St. Louis. 

With the experience gained, Mr. Rhead now follows 
this success with a still more admirable volume. From 
an artistic standpoint, from cover to back the book is 
notable, containing as it does about fifty original pictures, 
— several being in colors, — and having a remarkable 
cover representing the skin of a Striped Bass, painted 
from a living specimen and reproduced in the natural 
iridescent hues. There are also several photo-engravings 
of the fish in repose, as well as reproductions of drawings 
showing the modes of capture and the fish in action. 

The contribution on Salt-water Basses is written by 
Tarleton II. Bean, a world-famous scientific writer, the 
founder of the New York Aquarium, for many years 
a fish-culturist. United States Commissioner at many 
World's Fairs, and author of many books. Dr. Bean, in 
this volume, gives really the first adequate treatise ever 
written on the Striped Bass, its habits, habitat, and 
modes of capture. Little has previously been written on 
this coming, rightly named, game fish, and Dr. Bean 
writes fully and with authority on this and the other 
marine basses. 

The late William C. Harris was without a peer as a 
practical angler, and, after fifty years of continuous writ- 
ing, he took up for this volume, the Freshwater Basses. 

Mr. Rhead contributes three short articles ; one on 
The Choice of Flies, one on Basses in the Beaverkill, and 
another on Cooking Bass, with a few simple recipes. 

Mr. James A. Cruikshank, the well-known writer on 
angling, contributes a practical article on Artificial Lures, 
based on his expert knowledge of the subject and illus- 
trated by reproductions of Ynany of the most taking lures.

WOMEN PAINTERS OF 
THE WORLD 

from the time of Caterina Vierri (1413-1463) to 
Rosa Bonheur and the present day. Edited by 
WALTER SHAW SPARROW. With 6 photo- 
gravures, seven color plates, and more than 200 
half-tone illustrations. 

Any woman may well be proud of the record shown 
by this sumptuous book, extending as it does over a period 
of about 400 years and including hundreds of names that 
will go down to posterity with those of the most famous 
of their craft. 

The pictures have been reproduced with the greatest care, 
and while they include many famous paintings that are 
familiar, the greater part has been chosen from inaccessible 
sources or rare private collections, and are unfamiliar or 
unknown even to collectors. 

In preparing the text, which is sympathetic and 
exhaustive, the editor has been assisted by many well- 



known art critics, both in England and on the continent. 
This aims to show the growth of woman's influence on 
art and the part that she has played in it.

SERVING AND WAITING 

By ELEANOR MARCH ANT 

This book, prepared by a well-known writer on 
domestic topics, is intended particularly to meet the 
needs of the modest home where only one servant is 
kept, or possibly none at all. Tbe book covers a wide 
range of usefulness. Practically every form of table 
entertainment is considered in its pages, with much 
attention to the details of linen, china, silver, lighting, 
and floral decorations ; and chapters are devoted to in- 
formal functions and unique festivities. 

It is not a cook book, and yet it contains many invalu- 
able suggestions in cookery. It is not a book of etiquette, 
and yet the correct forms of service are fully defined. It 
is not a book of entertainment solely, but it answers very 
satisfactorily the problem : How to be a successful hostess. 
And, most importantly, it is a sure guide to making home 
and the home table attractive to one's own family. Be- 
sides these specific points of value, in ita dozen chapters, 
there is much housewifery information of a miscellaneous 
character.

THE FERN ALLIES OF 

NORTH AMERICA: North of 

Mexico 

By WILLARD NELSON GLUTS 
Author of " Our Ferns in Their Haunts," etc. 

Mr. Clute's "Our Ferns in Their Haunts" remains 
the standard work on the ferns of North America. In 
the preparation of this sequel, dealing with the allied 
forms of plant life not included in the fern families, the 
same careful attention to detail has been given that char- 
acterized the earlier book. 

It is a complete guide to all the native species found 
east of the Rocky Mountains and north of the Gulf States, 
described from natural specimens, and covering a greater 
range and including more species than any other similar 
work. Every common, or English, and scientific name is 
given. Special attention is paid to haunts and habits, 
uses, folk-lore, structure, growth, abundance, distribution 
and varieties.

dote of people and things and throws many new lights upon

THE JOY OF LIFE 

By LILLIE HAMILTON FRENCH 
As Pastor Wagner is the apostle of simplicity, so does 
Miss French plead for a little " joyfulness " In this book 
is a charming philosophy, illustrated with frequent pointed 
incidents, which will find many a responsive chord, and 
soothe many an hour at the close of a fretful day Our 
worries, our misunderstandings, the annoyances that we 
cause others and that others cause us. our deep griefs and 
our blfssings — these are put before us in a way that can- 
not fail to clear away the dust of daily life from our minds 
and hearts and leave us more courageous. 

Miss French is never didactic, never obtrusive, never 
choking us with a moral, but always gracious, enlivening, 
and natural. One can liken the reading of the book to a 
conversation with a delightful friend.

CHILDHOOD 

By MRS. THEODORE W. BIRNBY. 
With an Introduction by G. STANLEY HALL 

The author of this book, the founder of the National 
Congress of Mothers, has an authority based on wide and 
thoughtful experience. 

Her dominant impulse is to bring parents and children 
into closer and more sympathetic relations. She believes 
that discord in the home is in most cases due to a lack 
of comprehension of child nature and its needs on the 
part of those who have the care of the child. There is 
abundant parental, self-sacrificing love, but that it must 
be supplemented by real knowledge of the child's mental, 
moral, and physical nature. 

Through simple, practical illustrations of every-day 
occurrences the author makes clear to parents the impor- 
tance of being able to grasp the boy's or the girl's point 
of view, for only by so doing can they hope to gain the 
confidence of children and to guide them wisely.

THE SIEGE OF THE SOUTH 
POLE 

By H. R. MILL. 

Dr. Mill has collected in this volume, in consecutive 
form, a vast amount of material — in fact everything 
from the speculations of the ancients in regard to the 
Great Southern Ocean to the twentieth-century explora- 
tions of Nordenskjald, Bruce, and Scott. It is a narra- 
tive of courage, sacrifice, and adventure that has not 
been matched. 

The real story opens with the voyages of Capt. James 
Cook and the valuable data collected by the American 
whalers. Then follow chapters on the work of Belling- 
shausen, Weddell, the Enderbys, and others, leading up 
to Durville, for the French ; Lieut. Charles Wilkes, of 
the United States Exploring Expedition ; and James 
Clark Ross, of Erebus and Terror fame. The revival of 
interest through Sir John Murray's work in H. M. S. 
Challenger, the voyages of Qerlache, Borchgrevink and 
Drygalski. and as has been mentioned of Nordenskjold, 
Bruce and Scott, bring the narrative down to latest pos- 
sible date.

qualities of helpfulness, high integrity, and sweet woman-

MY FRIENDS AND THEIR 
GIFTS 

A record for those who give and receive. 

By MABEL L. BARBOUR. 

For several years the need has been felt for a con- 
venient book of record wherein could be found such 
information regarding one's friends as the dates of their 
birthdays and marriage anniversaries, their preferences 



as to colors, flowers, jewels, etc., the sizes of gloves and 
other apparel worn by them, and similar data of value 
when gifts are to be selected. This volume meets this 
need.

THUMB-O-GRAPHS 

The latest volume in the Record Series. 

The autograph hunter and the little maid with her 
birthday book are no longer satisfied with the mere 
names of their friends and of the world's celebrities. 
They must now have a " thumb-print " as well, and this 
latest fad, of combined science and amusement, promises 
to rival stamp-collecting in its popularity. The hobby 
has its growth in the great discovery that the lines on no 
two thumbs are ever alike, and that nobody's thumb ever 
changes the design of its whorls and lines. 

" Thumb-o-graphs " provides a neat little album, 
with pages for recording '* thumb-prints " and autographs, 
to which is attached a specially inked pad that only needs 
moistening to be ready for use.

KRAUSZ'S PRACTICAL

By SIGMUND KRA.USZ. 

Containing more than 12,000 technical terms and 

other words employed in connection 

with motor cars and motoring. 

The remarkable development of the motor car industry, 
especially in America, England, France, and Germany, the 
prevailing export and import conditions of the market, 
with the consequent migration of foreign chauffeurs and 
mechanics, as well as to the ever increasing international 
sport events, the growing habits of motorists to make 
pleasure tours in foreign lands, and — last but not least — 
the impossibility of finding proper translations of technical 
motoring terms in existing reference works, have caused 
an urgent demand for a special and practical automobile 
dictionary in the English, French and German languages. 

The work is invaluable for the engineering, corre- 
spondence, sales and other departments of motor car fac- 
tories, individual mechanics ambitious to increase their 
technical knowledge, sportsmen, motoring tourists and 
all owners in general who wish to keep abreast of the 
times.

offered at such a small price — and carry with them, so 
far as is possible in a single color, all the strength and

THE 


UNIVERSITY 


OF 


CHICAGO 


PRESS 



^HE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS announces the addition to its list 
-*- of periodical publications of two new journals, devoted to the interests of the 
Ancient Classics, namely: 

CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY 

Under the editorial direction of the Classical Department of the University of Chicago, 
with the cooperation of a number of representative scholars of other institutions; Professor 
Edward Capps, of the University of Chicago, Managing Editor. 

Classical Philology is established in the conviction that classical studies in America 
have so developed during the last quarter of a century as to demand an additional 
medium of publication, and that the establishment of such a journal will not only 
meet this need, but will also foster and encourage research, and materially help to 
raise the level of classical studies in this country. The journal will be devoted to 
investigations in the languages, literatures, history, and life of Classical Antiquities, 
and to reviews of current publications in these fields. It will be issued quarterly, 
in January, April, July, and October. The first number will appear about January i, 
1906. The first volume will contain about 380 pages. 

Subscription price, $3.00 a year; single copies, $1.00; foreign subscriptions, $3.50. 

THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 

Published under the auspices of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, 
and edited by a Board appointed by the Association; Professor ARTHUR FAIRBANKS, of 
the University of Iowa, and Professor GoRDON J. Laing, of the University of Chicago, 
Managing Editors. 

The Classical Journal is devoted especially to the interests of teachers of Greek 
and Latin, as teachers, whether in school or in college work. It will contain articles, 
editorials, discussions, and reviews. This medium of professional communication for 
all active students and teachers of the Classics will prove, it is believed, a most 
useful and effective instrument for the improvement of instruction and for the spread 
of intelligent interest in these subjects, and that through its influence a marked 
improvement in the standing of the Classics in this country may be confidently 
expected. 

The Classical Journal will be issued eight times a year, the first number to 

appear about December i, 1905. Each number will contain at least thirty-two pages. 

Subscription price, $2.00 a year; single copies, 30 cents; foreign subscriptions, $2. 25.

General Sociology 

An Exposition of the Main Development in Sociological 
Theory, from Spencer to Ratzenhofer. 

By ALBION W. SMALL 

Professor and Head of the department of Sociology in the 
University of Chicago. 

I N this important book Professor Small brings his wide reading and 
* keen analytical powers to bear on the history of sociology and its 
present claims to be regarded as a science. These claims have often 
been disputed, on the ground that the material of sociology has already 
been pre-empted by the recognized social sciences — ethnolc^y, history, 
economics, etc. Professor SmaU's answer is that the work of co-ordi- 
nating these various groups, of surveying the process of human associa- 
tion as a whole, is a task distinct from that of a worker in one of the 
special fields, and that the body of knowledge so gained legitimately 
ranks as a science. In other words, sociology is to social science in 
general what neurology is to medicine. It is addressed to historians, 
economists, political scientists, psychologists, and moralists, quite as 
much as to sociologists.

A Decade of Civic Development 




By CHARLES ZUEBLIN 

Professor of Sociology in the University of Chicago. 

Author of American Municipal Progress. 

Formerly President of American League for Civic Improvement. 

A VIGOROUS optimist is in himself a hopeful sign of the times. The 
author of this volume is a man of this stamp. " The last decade," 
he says, "has witnessed not only a greater development of civic improve- 
ment than any former decade, but a more marked advance than all the 
previous history of the United States can show." Professor Zueblin is 
a practical man. and his l)ook is a practical book. It gives a concise 
and spirited account of certain definite measures (.political, economic, 
social, and artistic) for the betterment of American cities. Here is a 
subject that lies at our very doors, a subject that no citizen can afford 
to overlook. 

Beginning with a discussion of the revived interest in citizenship, 
he treats in turn the training of the citizen, the making of the city, the 
educational effect of the great world's fairs, aAd the recent improve- 
ments in the cities where most has been done — Boston, New York, 
Harrisburg, and Washington.

NOTEWORTHY A4cdUrG PUBLICATIONS 

The New Idolatry and Other Discussions 

REV. WASHINGTON GLADDEN 
^T This notable book is a protest against the commercializing of government, of education, 
^J^ and of religion; against the growing tendency in Church and State to worship power 
and forget the interests of justice and freedom ; against the dethronement of God and the 
enthronement of Mammon. The volume includes the author's famous address on "Tainted 
Money," which is a splendid appeal for a revival of ethical idealism in our national life. 

Cloth, i2mo. Net, ^1.20; postpaid, ^1.30. 

Irish History and the Irish Question goldwin smith 

^T A brilliant treatment of the Irish question in the light of the lessons afforded by the 
^J^ history of the past relations between England and her neighbor. Notable for its liberal 
and enlightened sympathv and for the insistence which it places upon natural rather than 
political causes for Ireland's suffering. The author has done more to throw light upon the 
actual status of the Irish question than any writer of our time. It should do much towards 
creating a better understanding of the situation. 

Cloth, i2mo. Net, ^1.50; postpaid, ^1.60. 

The Wives of Henry VIII martin hume 

^T Martin Hume has ransacked Spanish and English records and archives, and unearthed 
^H^ masses of old letters and documents for the material of this new volume of popular 
history on the Wives of Henry VIII. Hence, he has been able to present the dramatic and 
pathetic stories of these six ill-fated consorts of the English Bluebeard with a wealth of vivid 
and human detail, and to show better than ever before what effect their lives have had upon 
the religion and political history of the period. 

Eight photogravures. Cloth. Net, ^3.75 ; postpaid, ^3.92. 
By the same author: "The Courtships of Queen Elizabeth," and "The Love Affairs of 
Mary Queen of Scots." Net, $3.50 each. 

The Torch george edward woodberry 

^T This book is generally regarded as Professor Woodberrv's masterpiece. It breathes 
^J^ not only an intense love of books, but an equally deep sympathy with life. 

"What he says of Shelley . . . and his sympathetic appreciation of Milton is a joy to 
lovers of poetry." — Milwaukee Sentinel. 

"At opposite extreme from the cheap jingoism which looks upon the Caucasian race, or 
perhaps even the Anglo-Saxon branch of it, as the divinely appointed heir of the ages, . . . 
is the broad evolutionary theory set forth in 'The Torch.'" — Springfield Republican.

NOTES 449 

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 451 



SEEBS, MAKERS, BARDS. 

It would save much confusion in criticism 
if it could be recognized and remembered that 
there are three great orders of poetic minds. 
These answer well enough to the old titles for 
the poet — Seer, Maker, Bard. 

The Seer is the man of vision, the prophet, 
the recipient of inspiration from above. In 
primitive times he is the founder of religions; 
in later days he is the expounder of philoso- 
phies. He is the dreamer of things past and 
to come. Oracles are on his lips. With a 
change of sex, he is the Pythoness or the Sybil. 
He comes now in glorious guise; he comes 
again in questionable shape. He is Zoroaster, 
Buddha, Christ, Mahomet. He is Voltaire, 
Eousseau, Byron. He is the stormy petrel who 
precedes every change in the moral or intel- 
lectual weather of the world. He leads crti- 
sades of righteousness; he draws men into 
pleasant pastures ; he warns them from abysses 
of wickedness. And when one good custom 
has corrupted a world he is just as apt as not 
to bring in evil, like an invading Paynim host, 
to rouse mankind from its complacent sloth. 

Many readers of Georg Brandes's 'Main 
Currents in Nineteenth- Century Literature' 
must have wondered at the importance the 
author attaches to writers like Chateaubriand, 
George Sand, and Madame Kriidener, — an im- 
portance altogether out of relation to the value 
their writings have now. But they bore the 
message their age needed. It was ApoUo and 
the Pythonesses come to answer the questions 
of a restless, craving world. And Byron ! His 
personality and work were the evangel his dav 
desired. His voice shook Europe because it 
uttered oracles that came home to the hearts 
of a revolutionarv race. 

That is the pity of prophecy. When it is 
done, it is dead. When it is fulfilled nothing 
can make it thrill again. Except when based 
on profound metaphysical or religious thought, 
the Seer's work is apt to be temporary and 
transient. It eruides the day. but the next dav 
needs a new direction. On the side of truth it 
is almost sure to be partial and incomplete; 
on the side of art it usually has the qualiti^ 
of improvisation. But when it is founded on 
eternal things, when it is accompanied by 
creative and literary power, it is the most ner- 
manent, the most serious, the most elevatinsr 
influence that enters into our lives. It is the 
ligbtningr that sweeps througrh our atmosphere 
and bums up the noxious vapors and refreshes 
the world. , ■

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



The Maker is a person of another queer sort. 
He is not interested in the changes of opinion. 
He cares nothing for proselytizing or reforming 
mankind. He is absorbed in his work as a hen 
is in hatching out its eggs. And the eggs he 
broods upon are a new nature, a new life. No 
mere understudy of nature is he. He is a 
spark of the original creative mind. He pierces 
to the true ideas of which the visible world is 
a copy, and out of them he moulds his types 
and forms. Not for him to choose between 
good and evil; not for him to guide and direct 
his fellows. Enough if he presents to them 
similars more vivid and vital than themselves. 

Think for a moment ! On one side is the 
real earth, crystal built, clothed with leafage, 
overhung with clouds and stars, tramped over 
by the interminable procession of mankind. 
On the other side is a dream world, built out 
of frail sounds and signs. Which is the more 
real? Anyone who has felt the power of liter- 
ature at all may hesitate to answer. Do we 
know our nearest friends, do we know ourselves 
as we know the great figures of literature? Do 
we see any scenes in nature as we see those 
described and interpreted by the master poets? 
Are the heroes of history as true to us as the 
men and women of the drama, epic, and novel ? 
Is Alexander a match for Achilles, or Philip 
the Silent as tremendous a presence as Hamlet ? 
It seems to me that there is only one answer to 
these questions. 

Besides, there is only one world of actuality. 
Though it change with the change of day and 
night, with the alternation of cloud and sun- 
shine, it is a tolerably constant spectacle. And 
human nature is tolerably constant, too. But 
there are a thousand worlds in literature. The 
world of Shakespeare differs more from the 
world of Homer than the actual English life 
differed from the Greek. The people of Jane 
Austen are more distinct from the people of 
Shakespeare than were the real English men 
and women of the two periods. The dream 
projections of literature are therefore the actual 
world, plus the personality of the creating 
artist, plus his particular gift of piercing to 
the abstract and typical ideas of humanity and 
nature. In other words, the figures of life are 
always individuals; the figures of literature 
are individuals made typical and colored by 
the preferences and prejudices of the writer. 

In actual life we only see silhouettes of our 
fellow human beings; in literature we get the 
round. People revolve about each other, much 
as the moon revolves about the earth, always 
keeping one side on view. Other eyes may see 
other sides, but that does not help any one of 
us to a true image. This is the reason of the 
inferiority of history to literature. In history 
we may have the report of a hundred different 



spectators as to a character or an event. But 
the reports vary, conflict, contradict each other. 
It is impossible to get a true conspectus. The 
literary creation rises before us in plain air, 
it turns round and round before us. All its 
actions are visible, all its speech audible. And 
more than that, it is as though made of glass 
or woven air, — all its inmost thoughts and 
feelings are revealed. 

The main business of the Bard is with the 
form of his art — with cadence, metre, phrase. 
Of course he must have something to reveal 
or tell, but how he speaks is of more import 
to him than what. In the modem point of 
view he is specifically the poet. The Seer may 
utter his message in any form of language. 
If his vision is true his speech will be pic- 
turesque; if his emotions are deep it will pul- 
sate musically. The Maker may use verse or 
prose indifferently. The superior concentra- 
tion of verse may be an advantage to him; but 
too much effort after beauty of phrase and 
perfection of cadence may spoil his broad ef- 
fects. It may give the impression of niggling, 
of littleness. Stevenson, with all his style, 
is far inferior in general results to Scott or 
Dumas. The two great romance writers were 
intent on telling their story, projecting their 
characters ; and they let their style take care of 
itself. Stevenson's first concern was to dress 
every idea as it arose in the most becoming 
words. But the pure Bardic poet has a right to 
dwell on words. With them he can work won- 
ders. He can almost dispense with meaning 
or story. It is hard to attach much meaning 
to Coleridge's ' Kubla Khan ' or to Poe's ' Ula- 
lume,' yet these pieces are among the poetic 
triumphs of our literature. Their miracles of 
cadence, their gleam and glow of words, hint 
unfathomable, undefinable things. They some- 
how touch chords in our nature which vibrate 
with ecstacy. Words, in fact, in metrical form 
share with music the power to stir the senses 
and the emotions. 

Music in words appeals directly to the senses, 
form and color appeal only indirectly through 
the mind. Music is therefore a more primitive 
quality in poetry than picture. Yet the gift 
to make language concrete, — to visualize, to 
flash the image on the brain, is probably the 
highest quality of expression. Arnold objected 
to Shelley that while he had the talent to con- 
trol sound, he lacked the intellectual power to 
command words. It is true. Compared to 
poets like Collins or Keats or Tennyson, he is 
thin and aerial — haunting enough, but not 
rich and real. 

Of course the division of the poetic hierarchy 
into three families is a mere analysis of possi- 
bilities. Concrete poets refuse to fall abso- 
lutely into any one of the divisions. But some 



1905.J 



THE DTATi

one strain of blood is usually predominant. 
Of our English poets, Chaucer is preeminently 
a maker. Solid flesh and blood was never set 
forth more convincingly. His language is a 
flawless, pellucid mirror to reflect his world. 
Spenser thought to be a Seer, but his dim 
allegories have little power or potency in them. 
He is the creator of a rich, many-colored cloud- 
•land. His verse, picturesque and harmonious 
as it is, has little of the true Bardic fire and 
splendor. The three strains or strands of power 
are more evenly woven into the texture of 
Shakespeare's mind than of any other writer 
whatever. Yet at different periods of his life 
one or the other started into prominence. He 
began by playing with words until he attained 
the most cunning mastery of all their secrete 
of sound and glow. In the end his interest 
in mere language weakened, or else he tried to 
wrench it to purposes beyond its power. 
Towards the middle of his career he was the 
consummate Maker. He hurled forth his great 
creations with the unmoved indifference of 
nature itself. Good or bad, beautiful or hid- 
eous, it was all one to him as long as the figures 
were vivid, vital, energetic. It was not until 
his crowning period that absolute Seership fell 
upon him — grief, anger, indignation wrought 
him into hatred for the actual world — into 
sympathy with the ideal one. In his mightiest 
productions he resembles the Angel with the 
flaming sword, set at the gates of Paradise, 
with humanity flying in the distance. Milton's 
creative force exhausted itself in the production 
of one figure — Lucifer. His prophetic gift 
kept him at the level of the Protestant theo- 
gony — not perhaps a very high level. But 
his Bardic gift was supreme. He wrought 
harmonies which mean more than language 
can utter, and pictures which outdo the colors 
of the world. Wordsworth and Shelley were 
the latter day prophets, Coleridge and Keats 
the Bards. The making impulse was weak in 
all of these, as it has been in most modem 
poets. 

We must turn to prose for our modern 
Makers. All over the world for the last hun- 
dred years or more the most powerfiil creative 
minds have done their spiritiiig in prose. It 
is unnecessary to call the roll of their names. 
The mere idea of the novelists calls up a vision 
of row after row, shelf after shelf, bookcase 
after bookcase of volumes in even sets. The 
only query is as to the permanence of this 
prodigious output. Lacking as it does the con- 
centration, the haunting cadences, the per- 
fected phrasing of verse; lacking, too. high 
vision and prophetic accent, it may be doubted 
whether posterity will consent to shoulder the

The Ibsen IjEtters.* 



The letters of Henrik Ibsen, covering a 
period of a full half-century, have at last been 
made accessible to the English-reading public, 
and the volume which contains them is a work 
of enduring value. Written with no thought 
of publication, these letters have the stamp of 
absolute sincerity, and reveal one of the most 
impressive personalities of our time. How 
interesting they will seem to the public in 
general we do not venture to say. To the pres- 
ent writer, who found his way to Dr. Ibsen's 
most significant work thirty years ago, and who 
has ever since found in that work an unfailing 
source of spiritual refreshment, a moral tonic 
for the mood of despondency, and a trumpet- 
call to renewed endeavor in the hour of dis- 
heartenment, these letters have so deep an 
interest that no other personal revelation oi 
recent years may be brought into comparison 
with them. 

The extent to which others wiQ share our 
feeling for this book will depend almost wholly 
upon the extent of their acquaintance with the 
work of its author. The name of Ibsen is a 
resounding one in the intellectual concerns of 
the present age, but it is safe to say that nine- 
tenths of those who use it — whether invoking 
it as a watchword or setting it up for a target — 
have only a fragmentary knowledge of the series 
of books that began with * Catilina ' and ended 
with *When We Dead Awake.' More partic- 
ularly it must be said that nine out of ten, 
and probably ninety-nine out of a hundred, of 
those who know 'A Doll Home,' or 'Ghosts,' 
or *Hedda Gabler,' must needs confess that 
they have never read ' Brand ' and ' Peer Gynt,' 
Jfow as we have often said before, these are 
the two works that outweigh all the oihers. 
and to claim an acquaintance with their author 
without having read them is like claiming to 
know Dante without *The Divine Comedy.' 
Shakespeare without 'Hamlet,' and Goethe 
without 'Faust.' 

We imagine, then, that the newly-published 
letters will not reveal the full secret of their 
interest to any large number of English read- 
ers, since familiarity with the works that con- 
tain the very core of Dr. Ibsen's thought is 
the necessary prerequisite of such a revelation. 
A fashion in recent criticism has given us much 
vague discussion of the relations between liter- 
ature and life, and of the importance of bring- 
ing the one into contact with the other. It is

own life, and for the ennoblement of the lives 
of others. To this effect he spoke, in 1880, as 
follows : 

'Everything that I have written has the closest 
possible connection with what I have lived through, 
even if it has not been my own personal experience; 
in every new poem or play I have aimed at my own 
spiritual emancipation and purification — for a man 
shares the responsibility and the guilt of the society 
to which he belongs. Hence I once wrote the fol- 
lowing dedicatory lines in a copy of one of my 

books: 

"At. leve er krig med trolde 
i hjertets og hjernens hvselv ; 
at digte — det er at holde 
dommedag over sig selv." ' 

Life is indeed a conflict with the wild passions 
that would work their goblin will upon heart 
and brain, and the true poet must ever sit in 
judgment upon himself no less than upon the 
world. The words above quoted express the 
one aspect of an author's responsibility; the 
other was realized and accepted by the writer 
in 1865, when his brain was teeming with 
' Brand,' and he wrote this confession to his 
closest friend: 

'If I were asked to tell at this moment what 
has been the chief result of my stay abroad, 1 
should say that it consisted in my having driven 
out of myself the aestheticism which had a great 
power over me— an isolated aestheticism with a 
claim to independent existence, ^stheticism of 
this kind seems to me now as great a curse to poetry 
as theology is to religion. . . . Is it not an in- 
expressibly great gift of fortune to be able to 
write? But it brings with it great responsibility; 
and I am now sufficiently serious to realize this and 
to be very severe with myself. An aesthete in Co- 
penhagen once said to me: "Christ is really the 
most interesting phenomenon in the world 's his- 
tory. " Tne aesthete enjoyed him as the glutton 
does the sight of an oyster. I have always been 
too strong to become a creature of that type; but 
what the intellectual asses might have made of 
me if they had had me all to themselves, I know 
not; it was you, dear Bjornson, who prevented 
them doing as they would with me.' 

While we are on the subject of 'Brand,' 
which is Dr. Ibsen's deepest work, and the most 
tremendous embodiment of his poetical enerary, 
some peculiarly interesting quotations from his 
correspondence may be given. He thus writes 
to Bjomstjerne Bjornson of the inception of 
the work in 1865 : 

'I threw to the winds all that I had been una- 
vailingly torturing myself with for a whole year, 
and in the middle of July began something new, 
which progressed as nothing has ever progressed 
with me before. The work is new, in the sense that 
T only began to write it then, but the subject and 
the mood have been weighing on me like a night- 
mare ever since the many lamentable political oc- 
currences at home first made me examine myself 
and the condition of our national life, and think 



about things that before had passed me lightly by. 
It is a dramatic poem, modern in subject, serious in 
tone, five acts in rhymed verse. ... I work 
both in the morning and the afternoon, a thing I 
have never been able to do before. It is delight- 
fully peaceful here; we have no acquaintances; 1 
read nothing but the Bible — it has vigour and 
power. ' 

In a letter of the following year, he says : 

' I kept struggling with my poem for a whole 
year before it took shape clearly; but once I had 
hold of it, I wrote from morning to night, and fin- 
ished it in less than three months.' 

And again, when the reaction from this mood 
of exaltation has come, he writes: 

'Dear Bjornson, it seems to me as if I were sep- 
arated from both God and men by a great, an in- 
finite void. Last summer when I was writing my 
drama, I was, in spite of all that harassed and per- 
plexed me, indescribably happy. I felt the exalta- 
tion of a Crusader, and I don't know anything 1 
should have lacked courage to face; but there is 
nothing so enervating and exhausting as this hope- 
less waiting. I dare say this is only a transition 
period. I will and shall have a victory some day. 
If the powers that be have shown me so little 
favour as to place me in this world and make me 
what I am, the result must be accordingly. But 
enough of this.' 

In this connection, we are given the letter from 
which Dr. Brandes quoted long ago, asserting 
that Brand might as well have been a sculptor 
or a politician as a priest. We also read: 

'You surely will not blame me because the book 
may have given pietism something to lean on. You 
might just as well reproach Luther with having in- 
troduced Philistinism into the world; it was cer- 
tainly not his intention to do so, and he must there- 
fore be held blameless.' 

He also takes occasion to defend the quan- 
tum satis and the deus caritatis of the mac- 
.sronic ending of ' Brand,' and to say that he 
did not have Kierkegaard particularly in his 
mind when he wrote the poem. But he adds: 
' The presentment of a life which has as its 
aim the realization of ideals will always possess 
certain points of resemblance to the story of 
Kierkegaard's.' 

Concerning ' Peer Gynt,' the companion- 
masterpiece of his great creative period, the 
author writes to his publisher and lifelong 
friend. Councillor Hegel : 

'And now I must tell you that my new work is 
well under way, and will, if nothing untoward hap- 
pens, be finished early in the summer. It is to be 
a long dramatic poem, having as its chief figure one 
of those half-mythical, fanciful characters existing 
in the annals of the Norwegian peasantry of 
modern times. It will have no resemblance to 
Brand, will contain no direct polemic, etc' 

A little later, we have these words: 

'I am curious to hear how you like the poem. I 
am very hopeful myself. It may interest you to 
know that Peer Gynt is a real person, who lived in 
Gudbrandsdal, probably at the end of last, or the 
beginning of this, century. His name is still well- 
known among the peasants there; but of his ex-

ploits not much more is known than is to be found 
in Asbjornsen's Norwegian Fairy-Tale Book, in the 
section, "Pictures from the Mountains." Thus 1 
have not had very much to build upon, but so much 
the more liberty has been left me.' 

And again, the next year: 

*I learn that the book created much excitement 
in Norway. This does not trouble me in the least; 
but both there and in Denmark they have discov- 
ered much more satire in it than was intended by 
me. Why can they not read the book as a poemf 
For as such I wrote it. The satirical passages are 
tolerably isolated. But if the Norwegians of the 
present time recognize themselves, as it would ap- 
pear they do, in the character of Peer Gynt, that 
is the good people's own affair.' 

And with sublime self-confidence, he thus 
replies to the charge that ' Peer Gynt ' is lack- 
ing in the poetical character: 

' My book is poetry; and if it is not, then it will 
be. The conception of poetry in our country, in 
Norway, shall be made to conform to the book. 
There is no stability in the world of ideas. The 
Scandinavians of this century are not Greeks.' 

The excited controversy aroused by ' Ghosts ' 
has several echoes in the correspondence of 
1882: 

' These last weeks have brought me a wealth of 
experiences, lessons, and discoveries. I was quite 
prepared for my new play eliciting a howl from the 
camp of the stagnationists; and I care no more for 
this than for the barking of a pack of chained dogs. 
But the alarm which I have observed among the 
so-called Liberals has given me cause for reflection. 
The very day after my play was published, the 
Dagblad rushed a hurriedly written article into 
print, with the evident purpose of at once render- 
ing any suspicion that it approved of my play im- 
possible, iliis was entirely unnecessary. I my- 
self am responsible ^or what I write, I and no one 
else. I cannot possibly bring trouble on any party; 
for I do not belong to any. I stand like a solitary 
franctireur at the outposts and act on my own re- 
sponsibility. 

'The only man in Norway who has stood up 
frankly, boldly, and courageously for me is Bjorn- 
son. It is just like him; he has, in truth, a great, 
a kingly soul; and I shall never forget what he 
has done just now. 

'But how about all these champions of liberty 
who have been frightened out of their witsf Is it 
only in the domain of politics that the work of 
emancipation is to be permitted to go on with usf 
Must not men's minds be emancipated first of allf 
Men with such slave-souls as ours cannot even make 
use of the liberties they already possess. Norway 
is a free country, peopled by unfree men and 
women. ' 

•There is not in the whole book a single opinion, 
a single utterance, which can be laid to the ac- 
count of the author. I took good care to avoid 
this. The method, the technique of the construc- 
tion in itself entirely precludes the author's appear- 
ing in the speeches. My intention was to produce 
the impression in the mind of the reader that he 
was witnessing something real. Now, nothing would 
more effectually prevent such an impression than 
the insertion of the author's private opinions in 
the dialogue. Do they imagine at home that I have 
not enough of the dramatic instinct to be aware of 
this? Of course I am aware of it, and act accord- 
ingly. And in no other play which I have written 



is the author such an outsider, so entirely absent, 
as in this last one. 

'Then they say that the book preaches nihilism. 
It does not. It preaches nothing at aU. It merely 
points out that there is a ferment of nihilism under 
the surface, at home as elsewhere. And this is in- 
evitable. A Pastor Manders will always rouse some 
Mrs. Alving to revolt. And just because she is a 
woman, she will, once she has begun, go to great 
extremes. ' 

'It may well be that the play is in several re- 
spects rather daring. But it seemed to me that the 
time had come when some boundary-posts required 
to be moved. And this was an undertaking for 
which an older writer like myself was more fitted 
than the many younger authors who might desire to 
do something of the kind.' 

Readers of Dr. Ibsen's works know how 
strongly he emphasizes the idea of a man's 
mission or calling (kald). In * The Pretend- 
ers,' in * Brand/ in ' Peer Gynt/ and in 
* Emperor and Galilean/ this conception 
appears in varying shapes, and in each case it 
is the very foundation of the psychological 
structure. The author's conception of his own 
calling appears in many passages of his letters, 
in the following, perhaps, (1879) as distinctly 
as anywhere: 

'As long as a people considers it more important 
to build meeting-houses than theatres, as long as 
it is readier to support the Zulu Mission than the 
Art Museum, art cannot really thrive, cannot even 
be considered as of immediate necessity. I do not 
think it is of much use to plead the cause of art 
with arguments derived from its own nature, which 
with us is still so little understood, or rather so 
thoroughly misunderstood. What is needed first of 
all with us is to fall upon and eradicate all that 
gloomy medieval monasticism which narrows the 
view and stupefies the mind. My opinion is that 
at the present time it is of no use to wield one's 
weapons for art; one must simply turn them 
against what is hostile to art. , First clear this 
away, and then we can build.' 

To act as the physician of the age, to point out 
the festering sores in the social and political 
organism, and to sear them with irons heated 
to whiteness in the furnace of the poet's indig- 
nation, — this was his mission, and for its sake 
he scorned delights and lived laborious days, 
exiling himself from home and country, preach- 
ing austere and uncomfortable doctrine to 
unwilling ears, and alienating his friends — 
even the one friend for whom his heart most 
yearned — by his uncompromising rectitude of 
soul. ' Friends are an expensive luxuyy/ he 
once wrote to Georg Brandes, 
'And when a man's whole capital is invested in 
a calling and a mission in life, he cannot afford to 
keep them. The costliness of keeping friends does 
not lie in what one does for them, but in what one, 
out of consideration for them, refrains from doing. 
This means the crushing of many an intellectual 
germ. I have had personal experience of it; and 
there are, consequently, many years behind me dur- 
ing which it was not possible for me to be myself.' 

Who, knowing the history of the man's life, 
and its significance for contemporary humanity.

THE DIALi 



[Dec. 16» 



could read the foregoing words unmoved, or 
the following words of appeal to the King for 
support : 

'It is not for a care-free existence I am fighting, 
but for the possibility of devoting myself to the 
task which I believe and know has been laid upon 
me by God — the work which seems to me more 
important and needful in Norway than any other, 
that of arousing the nation and leading it to think 
great thoughts. It remains with your Majesty to 
decide whether or not I shall have to keep silence, 
and suffer the bitterest disappointment which can 
befall a human soul — the disappointment of hav- 
ing to give up my life-work, of having to surren- 
der when I know myself to be in possession of ex- 
actly the intellectual weapons required.' 

The dignity of this appeal vies with its pathos, 
and both are equally impressive. 

Dt. Ibsen went into voluntary exile, as is well 
known, because he found the intellectual and 
moral atmosphere of his native land too stifling 
to breathe, and because freedom, both of 
thought and of its related action, was indis- 
pensable to his spiritual development. He 
writes to Fru Thoresen: 

'I had to get away from the beastliness up there 
before I could begin to be purified. I could never 
lead a consistent spiritual life there; I was one man 
in my work and another outside of it — and for that 
very reason my work failed in consistency too. I 
am aware that my present standpoint is in all prob- 
ability only a transitory one, but I do feel solid 
ground under my feet.' 

Here is a fine outburst of indignation and defi- 
ance, occasioned by the rough treatment 
accorded to ' Peer Gynt ' by some of its critics : 
'However, I am glad of the injustice that has 
been done me. There has been something of the 
God-send, of the providential dispensation in it; for 
I feel that this anger is invigorating all my pow- 
ers. If it is to be war, then let it be war! If I 
am no poet, then I* have nothing to lose. I shall try 
my luck as a photographer. My contemporaries in 
the North I shall take in hand, one after the other, 
as I have already taken the nationalist language 
reformers. I will not spare the child in the mother 's 
womb, nor the thought or feeling that lies under 
the word of any living soul that deserves the 
honour of my notice.' 

Some fifteen years later, the letters to Dr. 
Brandes yield the following revealing passages : 

'I have not the gifts that go to make a satis- 
factory citizen, nor yet the gift of orthodoxy; and 
what I possess no gift for, I keep out of. Liberty 
is the first and highest condition for me. At home 
they do not trouble much about liberty, but only 
about liberties — a few more or a few less, accord- 
ing to the standpoint of their party.' 

'You are, of course, right when you say that we 
must all work for the spread of our opinions. But 
I maintain that a fighter in the intellectual van- 
guard can never collect a majority round him. In 
ten years the majority will, possibly, occupy the 
standpoint which Dr. Stockmann held at the public 
meeting. But during these ten years the Doctor 
will not have been standing still; he will still be 
at least ten years ahead of the majority. He can 
never have the majority with him. As regards 
myself, at least, I am conscious of incessant pro- 
gression. At the point where I stood when I wrote 



each of my books, there now stands a tolerably 
compact crowd; but I myself am no longer there; 
I am elsewhere; farther ahead, I hope.' 

The solitude to which all great souls are con- 
demned by the very fact of their greatness, 
the yearning for a companionship that they 
never find, finds poignant expression in one of 
the latest letters of all, a letter written in 
1897, after the writer's return to Norway. 

'Can you guess what I am dreaming about, and 
planning, and picturing to myself as something de- 
lightful? The making a home for myself near the 
Sound between Copenhagen and Elsinore, on some 
free, open spot, whence I can see all the sea-going 
ships starting and returning from their long voy- 
ages. That i cannot do here. Here all the sounds 
are closed, in every acceptation of the word — and 
all the channels of intelligence are blocked. Oh, 
dear Brandes, it is not without its consequences 
that a man lives for twenty-seven years in the 
wider, emancipated and emancipating spiritual con- 
ditions of the great world. Up here, by the fjords, 
is my native land. But — but — but! Where am I 
to find my home-land?' 

The limitations of space forbid our continu- 
ation of these extracts, although we should 
like to include a series of passages to illustrate 
the author's political creed, another series con- 
cerning his relations with Bjomstjerne Bjom- 
son, another from the correspondence with his 
helpful and devoted publisher and friend 
(Councillor Hegel of the great house of Gyld- 
endal), and still another to comprise the occa- 
sional glimpses which we get of his feelings 
toward father, mother, and sister in his native 
town of Skien. But for these, and other 
weighty matters, we must refer to the book 
itself, from which we make one further draft 
in closing. 

'So to conduct one's life as to realize one's self 
— this seems to me the highest attainment possible 
to a human being. It is the task of one and all of 
us, but most of us bungle it.' 

This is the sum and substance of the author's 
teaching, the burden of his message to an age 
made flabby by compromise, and impoverished 
in the very springs of its vitality by the weak- 
ening of the individual will.

pansion of ciyilization the terrae incognitae 
have become more remote and increasingly dif- 
ficult of access, but the zest for exploration 
and love of adventure is not thereby daunted- 
Neither have books of travel and exploration 
abated their interest nor lost their constituency. 
To an English — and let us hope equally to an 
American — reading public a book of polar 
exploration needs no introduction to its old 
yet ever new charm, and calls for no apology 
or labored discourse on the value of its scien- 
tific results. Captain Scott's account of 'The 
Voyage of the Discovery ' strikes a responsive 
chord in every lover of adventure, in every 
admirer of heroic effort. 

In the annals of English explorations the 
name ' Discovery ' has had an honorable and 
glorious history. Xo less than six ships of 
famous exploring expeditions have added to 
its lustre. The first, in 1602 to 1616, made six 
voyages into the Arctic regions, under the com- 
mand, for a time at least, of the famous navi- 
gator William Baffin. The names of Captain 
Cook, of Vancouver, and of Stevenson are as- 
sociated with its later successors. The latest 
to be christened with the historic name was the 
ship specially constructed for exploration in 
high latitudes which carried the recent English 
Xational Antarctic Expedition safelv through 
two winters in the ice of the South Polar Sea. 

Captain Scott's ' Discover}- ' was not built 
on the lines of Professor Xansen's ' Fram,' to 
slip easily above the surface of the crowding 
ice when caught in the terrific pressure of the 
pack, but rather on those which gave her 
greater seaworthiness and much greater powers 
as an ice-breaker, — both prime desiderata for 
a vessel which must withstand the extreme and 
fitful weather of high southern latitudes and 
must also push its way through the vast fring- 
ing ice pack to the open sea beyond, on both ihe 
outgoing and the return trips. Accordingly, 
massive walls of oak, greenheart, and mahog- 
any, two feet in thickness, supported by hugh 
timbers, formed the bow of the vessel, while 
her sides and stem were well protected to 
stand immense lateral pressure. Her lines 
were those of the ' Discovery ' of the Arctic 
expedition of 1875, a type evolved in the Green- 
land whaling industry, with overhanging stem 
especially serviceable in ramming and breaking 
the pack ice. 

The equipment of the expedition was the 
best that could be devised in the light of the 
experience of former explorers. It comprised 
Xansen sledges and cookers for long sledge 
joumevs, Xorwegian skis, pemmican from 
Copenhagen, dogs from the Samoyedes, rein- 
deer sleeping bags, felt boots from Eussia, 
reindeer fur boots or finneskoes from Xprway, 
and grass (sennegrae?) from Lapland for the 



protection of feet in the frozen fur boots, a 
balloon, great stores of explosives for blasting 
the ice pack, food for three years, tents, boats, 
lumber for huts, scientific instruments and 
paraphernalia galore. Xo wonder that every 
available inch was stowed full, and that the 
decks were piled high with freight! 

Though the vessel and her equipment re- 
flected to a high degree the experiences of the 
past in polar exploration, the personnel of the 
expedition contained but little seasoned timber, 
— indeed but two of the oflBcers (the navigator 
and one of the surgeons) had had any previous 
experience in the arduous and particular labors 
of travel amidst polar snow and ice. Captain 
Scott relates with refreshing frankness the 
blunders and mistakes into which his inexpe- 
rienced party fell, difficulties with dogs and 
sledges, the damage and the almost total loss 
of the boats, the failures of their dogs, and not 
the least a serious outbreak of scurvy. The 
age of the members would have met with Dr. 
Osier's approval. Only one had attained the 
dead line of forty, and the average age of the 
ward room mess was little over twenty-four 
years! Captain Scott himself is enthusiastic 
in his approval of the youth of his companions, 
'concerning the advantages of which I could 
write many pages.' 

The discipline aboard ship was excellent, and 
the success of the expedition was not marred 
by bickerings and strife as it has been in the 
case of some polar parties. 

*It must be understood that the "Discovery" not 
being in Government employment, had no more 
stringent regulations to enforce discipline than 
those which are contained in the Merchant Ship- 
ping Act, and however adequate these may be for 
commercial purposes, they fail to provide that 
guarantee for strict obedience and good behaviour 
which I believe to be a necessity for such excep- 
tional conditions as exist in Polar service. Through- 
out our three-years' voyage in the "Discovery" 
the routine of work, the relations between officers 
and men, and the general ordering of matters were, 
as far as circumstances would permit, precisely such 
as are customary in His Majesty's ships. We lived 
exactly as though the ship and all on board had 
been under the Xaval Discipline Act; and as every- 
one must have been aware that this pleasing state 
of affairs was a fiction^ the men deserve as much 
credit as the officers, if not more, for the fact that 
it continued to be observed.' 

The r^on chosen by the scientific commit- 
tee in charge of the expedition as the field for 
the work of the 'Discovery' was the Ross 
quadrant to the south of Xew Zealand, the best 
known of the Antarctic regions. It was here 
that land masses and mountains were known 
to exist, that highest latitudes could be reached ; 
and. moreover, it was nearest to the magnetic 
pole. In addition to the magnetic, meteoro- 
logical, geological, oceanographic, and biolog- 
ical investigations incident to an expedition

into these latitudes. Captain Scott had the fol- 
lowing geographical problems to solve: 

'To explore the ice-barrier of Sir James Eoss to 
its eastern extremity; to discover the land which 
was believed by Ross to flank the barrier to the 
eastward, or to ascertain that it does not exist, and 
generally to endeavor to solve the very important 
physical and geographical questions connected with 
this remarkable ice-formation. ... If you 
should decide to winter in the ice your efforts as re- 
gards geographical exploration should be directed 
to three objects, namely — an advance into the west- 
ern mountains, an advance to the south, and an ex- 
ploration of the volcanic region.' 

This is an ambitious programme. How ad- 
mirably it was carried out can best be judged 
by a careful perusal of Captain Scott's modest 
story of his efforts and an inspection of the 
results of other Antarctic expeditions. 

The ' Discovery ' expedition left England 
August 5, 1901, and returned three years later, 
having spent two winters within the Antarctic 
circle fast in the ice in McMurdo Sound not 
far from the famous volcanoes Mts. Erebus and 
Terror. Before entering winter quarters the 
' Discovery ' was able to explore the whole face 
of the Great Ice Barrier which extends over 
34° of longitude eastward of South Victoria 
Land. Its eastern limits were established by 
the discovery in longitude 150° W., of King 
Edward VII. Land. Its present face has re- 
ceded from twenty to thirty miles since it was 
surveyed by Sir James Eoss sixty years ago. 
This fact agrees with the evidences of glacial 
recession in the land ice. Captain Scott argues 
that this great ice sheet, hundred of miles in 
extent, is afloat, basing his conclusions upon 
soundings along its face, upon temperatures 
taken in crevasses, its rise and fall with the 
tide, and the regularity of the tremendous 
radial crevasses twenty to thirty miles in 
length which form in its margin where great 
glaciers from the inland ice cap of Victoria 
Land join it. A displacement of 608 yards in 
thirteen months of one of the depots established 
near its margin indicates considerable move- 
ment in this huge field of ice. The height 
above sea level of its free sea-worn face reaches 
a maximum of 380 feet, and its mean thickness 
is estimated to approximate 900 feet. Exami- 
nation from the balloon, and the various sledge 
journeys from winter quarters, indicate that 
the Great Ice Barrier is a monotonous level 
field of ice, devoid of life or of relief of any 
sort save that which the fierce and fitful winds 
that sweep with terrific violence over its surface 
give to the sastrugi or snow waves on its sur- 
face. It was along the western margin of this 
Great Barrier that Captain Scott made a 
memorable sledging journey to the southward 
in the summer of 1902. The results of this jour- 
ney, lasting ninety-three days and covering 960 
statute miles, afford a very complete survey of 



the western boundary of the Barrier and the 
eastern mountains of Victoria Land to lati- 
tude of 83° S., nearly 5° beyond all previ- 
ous records. Photographs, panoramas, and 
sketches, as well as multitudinous observations, 
make the record of this journey exceptionally 
complete. 

The unique story of this long but successful 
struggle with nature in her wildest moods, 
against appalling odds, forms one of the most 
thrilling chapters in the history of polar ex- 
plorations. The battle with repeated blizzards, 
and the fearful cold, the toilsome march with 
the heavily laden sledges through the yielding 
snow or over the rough sastrugi^ the oft-recur- 
ring frost bites, the blinding glare of the snow, 
the scant food supply, the horrible nights in 
frozen or chill and damp sleeping bags, re- 
lieved only by oft-repeated but never realized 
dreams of an ample meal, and worst of all the 
slow but certain inroads of scurvy, — all these 
combine to heighten the heroism of Captain 
Scott and his two companions. 

One of the greatest discomforts in sledging 
arises from the difficulty of resting in the fur 
sleeping bags, which gather the snow and 
moisture and soon double their weight with 
the accumulating ice, which cannot be removed 
even in the heat of the so-called summer of 
the Antarctic. 

'A night in such a sleeping-bag as we are pictur- 
ing, with the temperature below 40°, cannot be 
said to be less than horribly uncomfortable. . . . 
Ordinarily, we sleep in the fitful, broken, comfort- 
less fashion of which the mere recollection is a 
nightmare, and even this poor apology for slum- 
ber does not come until we have lain broad awake 
and shivering for an hour or two. 

'With the temperature at --48° we can make a 
shrewd guess as to the sort of night that is before 
us. The first half-hour is spent in constant shift- 
ing and turning, as each inmate of the bag tries 
to make the best of his hard mattress or to draw 
the equally hard covering closer about him. There 
is a desultory muffled conversation broken by the 
chattering of teeth. Suddenly the bag begins to 
vibrate, and we know that someone has got the 
shivers. It is very contagious, this shivering, and 
paroxysm after paroxysm passes through the whole 
party. . . . Presently we hear our neighbour 
marking time, and we rather unnecessarily ask him 
if his feet are cold; he explains their exact state 
in the most forcible language at his command.' 

In the following winter Captain Scott made 
a sledge journey on to the ice cap which covers 
the great plateau of Victoria Land, 'the most 
desolate region of the world. There is none 
other that is at once so barren, so deserted, so 
piercingly cold, so wind swept, so fearsomely 
monotonous.' The elevation of this great snow 
plain is about 9,000 feet, and above it tower 
naked and barren peaks or nunataks to eleva- 
tions of over 15,000 feet. Captain Scott spent 
eighty-one days in a toilsome journey up the 
glacier to this plateau and over its undulating

surface, a distance of 1,098 miles, and climbed 
total heights of 19,800 feet. He closes his rec- 
ord with a * devout hope that wherever my 
future wanderings may trend, they will never 
again lead me to the summit of Victoria Land/ 

One of the dangers incident to travel on the 
ice is that from crevasses hidden by the snow. 
Into one of these fathomless blue depths Cap- 
tain Scott and one of his two companions were 
suddenly precipitated, 

'Personallv I remember absolutely nothing until 
I found mvself dangling at the end of my trace 
with blue walls on either side and a very horrid- 
looking gulf below; large ice-crystals dislodged by 
our movements continued to be showered down on 
our heads. As a first step I took ofif my goggles; 
I then discovered that Evans was hanging just 
above me. I asked him if he was all right, and re- 
ceived a reassuring reply in his usual calm matter- 
of-fact tones. Meanwhile I groped about on every 
side with my cramponed feet, only to find every- 
where the same slippery smooth wall. But my 
struggles had set me swinging and at one end of a 
swing my leg suddenly struck a projection. . . . 
I found myself standing on a thin shaft of ice 
which was wedged between the walls of the chasm 
— how it came there I cannot imagine, but its po- 
sition was wholly providential; to the right or left, 
above or below, there was not the vestige of another 
such support — nothing, in fact, but the smooth walls 
of ice. . . . With two of us on top and one be- 
low, things had assumed a very different aspect, and 
I was able to unhitch my own harness and lower it 
once more for Evans; then with our united efforts 
he also was landed on the surface, where he ar- 
rived in the same frost-bitten condition as I had. 
For a minute or two we could only look at one an- 
other, then Evans said, "Well, I'm blowed"; it 
was the first sign of astonishment he had shown.' 

Not the least interesting part of Captain 
Scotf s narrative are his references to the ani- 
mal life of the Antarctic. 

'There are no land mammals, properly so called, 
within the Antarctic Circle. There are no South 
Polar bears; there are no Antarctic foxes; there 
are no large mammals of any sort or kind save 
whales, which live entirely in the water, and seals, 
which spend more than half their time there. 

' Geology has not disclosed to us any lost Antarc- 
tic mammalian fauna, although it has suggested to 
US the possibility that at one time there was a cli- 
mate, and perhaps a vegetation, that might have 
suited it. . . . Separated now by some hun- 
dreds of miles of very stormy ocean from the near- 
est habitable lands, with currents of wind and 
water all setting in precisely the wrong direction, 
it maintains an almost perfect barrenness. 
_ ' The Antarctic continent now boasts of a vegeta- 
tion which includes a few low forms of moss'^and 
lichen, and a terrestrial fauna which consists of 
one minute and primitive form of wingless insect. 
Of the whales and seals and birds, the last-named 
alone have any pretension at all to a terrestrial 
habit of life, in that they use the moraines and 
rocky cliffs of the continental shores as nesting 
sites. But they are all pelagic sea-birds.' 

The expedition was particularly fortunate 
in having the services of several excellent 
photographers and of the surgeon-artist Dr. 
Wilson. The latter's sketches of the wonder- 



ful mock suns seen on the Great Barrier, and 
of the aurora australis are unique; while his 
studies of the great Emperor penguins con- 
stitute a most interesting bit of natural his- 
tory. The two volumes are very fully illus- 
trated by most excellent reproductions of 
well selected photographs, which in themselves 
constitute a record of the expedition of a most 
interesting nature. In this particular these 
volumes of polar travel easily surpass all 
previously-published accounts of exploration at 
either pole. 

Captain Scotf s narrative is very full of de- 
tail, — confessedly so, for the sake of utility 
to others who would attempt a similar enter- 
prise. But it never becomes tedious thereby, 
indeed one's interest is rather increased by 
the fulness and care with which the story is 
told. The freshness and novelty of the sub- 
ject matter command an immediate hearing, 
and the charm of the narrative, the well bal- 
anced perspective, and above all the manly 
record of heroic endeavor here revealed bid 
fair to make Captain Scott's modest account 
one of the classics of polar exploration. 

Doubtless there were many favoring circum- 
stances which enabled the expedition to make 
this phenomenal record, — a lucky choice for 
winter quarters in close proximity to a feasi- 
ble southern route, and favorable movements 
of the ice-pack which gave it the chance to 
reach high latitudes and to escape again with 
the ship. But after all is said, a large modicum 
of praise is due to this intrepid explorer and 
his plucky company for the untiring zeal which 
they exhibited in pushing forward the confines 
of knowledge in the Antarctic by almost super- 
human efforts, in physical discomfort and 
amidst dangers that would have appalled most 
men even of Anglo-Saxon blood. To the Hst 
of British names illustrious in the annals of 
exploration, to those of Drake, Cook, Baffin, 
Franklin, Boss, and Nares, should be added 
that of Scott. Charles Atwood Kofoid. 



EXGLAXD'S I.ATER TEARS.* 



Mr. Justin McCarthy has employed the years 
of his ill health and enforced withdrawal from 
political life in preparing various works of his- 
torical character dealing primarily with the 
reign of Queen Victoria. He now presents the 
fourth and fifth volumes of his ' History of Our 
Own Times,' the first two volumes of which 
appeared many years ago, followed much later 
by a third volume. In the words of the preface, 
these two concluding volumes

'have for their object in the first instance to give 
a clear and comprehensive account of all the 
events of public importance occurring in or to the 
British Empire during the years between Queen 
Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and the accession of 
King Edward the Seventh. But, besides this ob- 
vious object, the volumes include a retrospect of 
the important changes which the reign of Queen 
Victoria saw in the public life, the literature, art, 
and science — more especially the applied science — 
of that period, the changes which have come about 
in the habits and manners of the time; and also 
the leading characteristics of the men and women 
who have grown into celebrity during these later 
years. ' 

This quotation sufficiently indicates the pur- 
pose of the author and the scope of his work. As 
in the previous volumes, Mr. McCarthy's method 
is that of the high class journalist rather than 
that of the historian ; and in this is to be found 
the chief charm of his work, for the reader ob- 
tains the acute impressions of a contemporan- 
eous observer of events, presented in a pleasing 
and clear style. Some of the principal condi- 
tions thus described are, in Volume IV., the 
development of the policy of colonial federation, 
with resulting difficulties in South Africa, the 
European aspect of the Greek-Turkish war, the 
reconquest of Egypt, the 'Boxer' troubles in 
China, the American intervention in Cuba, and, 
in home politics, industrial questions, church 
rituals, woman's suffrage, and the ordinary par- 
liamentary happenings not treated under other 
headings. In Volume V. the only topic of 
extra-English interest treated at length is the 
war in South Africa, the greater portion of the 
volume being given to purely insular politics, 
and to characterizations and retrospect of men 
and conditions of the entire Victorian era. From 
none of these chapters does the reader obtain 
any new information of historical importance, 
for Mr. McCarthy has simply thrown into at- 
tractive form the current newspaper knowledge 
of the events themselves. Nor is any real criti- 
cism offered, for the author is so consistently 
generous in his attitude toward the leading men 
of England that he sees only, or at least states 
only, their good qualities. It is certainly not 
historically true, for example, that Gladstone's 
motives were never attacked by his political 
opponents; and yet Mr. McCarthy in a chapter 
wholly laudatory in its character, on ' The Death 
of Gladstone,' asserts that ' Even his [Glad- 
stone's] most unyielding political opponents 
never believed him guilty of adopting any 
course for the sake of mere party interests or 
of taking up any cause for the reason that It 
was popular, and that its advocacy might 
strengthen the Administration of which he was 
the leader.' Possibly Mr. McCarthy would make 
a distinction between an attack by political 
opponents upon the motives of Gladstone, and 
the real belief of those same opponents in their 



purity. But when Mr. Morley has found it 
necessary to devote much space in his Life of 
Gladstone to a defense of Gladstone's seemingly 
sudden conversion to a Home Rule policy, it 
would certainly appear that he at least believed 
in the sincerity of the criticisms made. For Mr. 
Morley's defense is a defense of the motives, not 
of the act itself. 

If, then, these additional volumes of the 
' History of Our Own Times ' contain no new 
material and are not critical, in what way are 
they of any historical importance? In none 
save in the impression received, even though not 
distinctly stated, of the author's own personal 
attitude toward men and events. For Mr. Mc- 
Carthy is himself a man of historical importance 
whose opinions it would be well worth while to 
Ivnow, even if only with the purpose of estimat- 
ing his attitude, and the attitude of the party, 
to which he belonged, toward leading personages 
and conditions in recent English history. As 
already indicated, it is wholly impossible to 
know how the author really estimates the men of 
this period. And even with regard to events 
and conditions, the same non-critical character- 
istics render any understanding of the author's 
personal convictions diflBcult. Yet he certainly 
has them, and occasionally they peep out from 
the carefully worded resume he offers. Taking 
for granted his belief in the justice and wisdom 
of Home Rule for Ireland, to the attainment of 
which Mr. McCarthy has devoted his political 
life, his most marked revelations of self are 
centered about four topics. He is distinctly not 
attracted by the modern cry of ' Imperialism,' 
caustically remarking that this more eupheumis- 
tic term has come to be applied in late years to 
what was once spoken of in contempt, or at least 
in derogation, as ' Jingoism.' Again, while he 
is eminently just in detailing the proof offered 
before the Parliamentary committee that in- 
vestigated the extent of the participation of 
Rhodes and of Chamberlain in the famous 
' Jameson Raid,' he unquestionably sympathise 
with that minority which believed the committee 
unwilling to probe the matter to the bottom. In 
the third place, in a chapter entitled ' Here's a 
Woman Would Speak ' he notes the steady devel- 
opment of the woman's suffrage principle in 
municipal and county organizations, and by his 
friendly discussion of the greater issues of na- 
tional voting and representation shows at least 
an open mind and a sympathetic attitude towaxd 
the general movement, though he does not 
prophesy and does not distinctly state his own 
principles. And finally and chiefly, he is think- 
ing and writing of a world that has passed, of 
men that have played their part and have dis- 
appeared from the scene of action, of events that 
have had historical importance but are no longer

intimately related with the world of to-day. It 
may seem impossible that one writing of so recent 
a period should acquire so remote a point of 
view, yet the impression is there and is perhaps 
intentionally conveyed. For Mr. McCarthy cer- 
tainly feels and makes his readers feel that the 
Victorian era is closed, and that the men who 
took important parts in those years can not, and 
have not, been replaced in the present English 
political world. His two volumes are divided 
into twenty-four chapters, of which four specifi- 
cally deal with the death lists of separate years, 
while two others are devoted to summaries of 
the careers of Gladstone and of Queen Victoria 
respectively, so that one-sixth of the contents 
of his work is concerned with what may be called 
obituary reminiscences. In addition to all this, 
one of the two concluding chapters of *Ketro- 
spect ' consists of personal impressions of parlia- 
mentary leaders who died at a time earlier than 
the period of which these later volumes treat. 
This striking characteristic of Mr. McCarthy's 
work is surely illuminative of his own temper 
of mind; and while it may be regarded as a 
flaw in his method of treatment, it nevertheless 
adds much to our understanding of the author. 
The first two volumes of this history, written 
at a time when the author was closely con- 
nected with the men he described, and the events 
he narrated, glowed with the vigor of enthusias- 
tic participation, and conveyed something of the 
glamour of autobiographical statement. In these 
later volumes he is the intelligent observer, but 
lacking in the inspiration that comes with in- 
timate knowledge. Yet the most persistent feel- 
ing with the reader will be one of regret that 
the author should realize so profoundly and un- 
necessarily the close of his own distinguished 
political career, — a regret the more keen when 
it is remembered that he still holds a unique 
position as the clearest and most entertaining 
narrator of modem political events. 

For while in honest criticism it must be 
frankly stated that this * History ' is no history 
at all in the proper use of the term, it is never- 
theless true that Mr. McCarthy has succeeded in 
conveying in better form than has previously 
been done a mass of logical selected information 
about the last years of Victoria's reign. His vol- 
umes may be considered as the highest form of 
such productions as the ' Annual Register,' sys- 
tematized and made consecutive. To this he 
has added personal characterizations, which, 
while invariably too generous, yet leave a clear 
impression of the person described. His last 
chapter of ' Retrospect ' is not so valuable, for it 
is merely a summary of physical and scientific 
changes that have taken place during the cen- 
tury, and contains no real analysis of the effects 
of such changes on national character or life. 



But Mr. McCarthy is always readable, and the 
entertaining quality of his work will undoubt- 
edly be of value in bringing to the negligent 
reader some familiarity, at least, with the main 
features of later English politics. The work is 
illustrated with sixteen portraits, and the last 
volume contains a good index, -g j^ Ad-ams

It is not often that biographers so discrimin- 
ating, painstaking, and appreciative as Messrs. 
M. H. SpieLmann and G. S. Layard are per- 
mitted to exercise their gifts upon material so 
delightfully adapted to their purposes as that 
which clusters about the name of Kate Green- 
away. Their joint biography, drawing its lit- 
erary interest from many and unique sources, 
and illustrated by numberless artistic repro- 
ductions of drawings either unpublished hith- 
erto or wholly inaccessible to the general 
public, is one of the few real treasures of the 
autumn publishing season. Those who have 
long loved Kate Greenaway and her quaint 
conceptions of childhood will take pleasure in 
so distinguished a study of her life and work, 
and will find much interesting new material 
to add to their own memories. And on the 
other hand, that much larger circle who regard 
Miss Greenaway vaguely as a bygone illustrator 
of children's books which set a passing fashion 
for big hats, mitts, muffs, and short-waisted, 
long-€^rted dresses, and who know nothing 
definite about her private life, — this great 
majority will be pleasantly surprised at the 
revelations of the new biography. Even now, 
as the writers admit. Miss GreenawaVs stand- 
ing as an artist is disputed. 'As Mr. Lionel 
Robinson asked at the time [of her death] — 
did she found a school or did she only start a 
fashion? Was hers but a passing ad captan- 
dum popularity or does her art contain the 
true elements of immortality ? ' However time 
may answer these questions, it is certain that an 
art and a personality which could interest 
Ruskin and draw from him unstinted praise 
and many a vigorous scolding (more good- 
tempered than Ruskin's scoldings were at all 
given to being) and could win for themselves 
besides a host of friends like the Locker-Lamp- 
sons, the du Mauriers, Mr. Austin Dobson, the 
Tennysons, and the Arthur Severns, — that an 
art and a personality so environed will be capa- 
ble of interesting biograpliical treatment. 

The peculiar competence of the present 
wi-iters lies in their eager seizure upon all pos- 
sible points of interest, and their strong sense

of proportion, which assigns to each item its 
proper space in a volume that has not a dull 
page or a bit of superfluous ' padding/ 
Apart from her work, they justly consider the 
great feature of Kate Greenaway's life to have 
been her friendship with Ruskin. They have 
been very fortunate in securing from Ruskin's 
literary executors generous permission to make 
copious extracts from Ruskin's side of the cor- 
respondence that went on vigorously between 
him and ' K. G/ for many years, until owing 
to Euskin's failing health it finally ended 
as a wonderfully sustained and spirited mono- 
logue by ' K. G.' alone. These letters, hitherto 
unpublished, constitute the unique feature of 
the text, though it must not be rashly assumed 
that the narrative or the rest of Miss Green- 
awa3^s correspondence are lacking in vivacity 
or in the atmosphere that enables the reader to 
realize the delightful personality behind the 
commonplace and unobtrusive exterior that its 
owner sometimes bemoaned. Much of the 
material in the chapters entitled ' Early Years ' 
was obtained from the rough draught of an 
unfinished autobiography of Miss Greenaway's 
childhood. Owing to their discursiveness and 
lack of literary form, these reminiscences have 
been generally reproduced in the third person. 
To them is due in large measure the vivacity 
of this portion of the narrative. An interesting 
side-issue is the careful account of the part- 
nership between Miss Greenaway and Mr. 
Edmund Evans, to whose expert color-printing 
by means of wood blocks was due a measure of 
her wonderful success. The revolution she 
achieved in one form of book-illustration 
would have been impossible without Mr. Evans's 
help. Nor are Miss Greenaway's verses neg- 
lected. These are often referred to incidentally, 
and a final chapter sums up the matter much 
after the judgment of Mr. Austin Dobson, who 
declared, 'She was very deficient in technique, 
but she had the root of the matter in her.' 

As for the illustrations, they are all unique. 
Nothing is reproduced from Kate Greenaway's 
regularly published books, and it seems as if 
no pains had been spared to collect ajl the per- 
sonal and elusive drawings, whether • mere 
sketches or elaborate oil portraits, which are 
treasured by her brother, and her friends and 
patrons, and by their generosity here first 
reproduced. The end-papers are facsimiles in 
miniature from the nursery wall paper printed 
with Kate Greenaway^s special permission by 
the owner of the original drawing. Pen and 
pencil sketches that appeared on letters to 
Euskin or Miss Dickinson form chapter head- 
ings or black-and-white inserts. Sometimes 
a whole letter, with its drawing, is reproduced 
in facsimile, and several of Euskin's letters are 
shown in the same form. The color-prints, 



exquisite exsimples of the best results to be 
obtained by the modern three-color process, 
reproduce water-color drawings in the posses- 
sion of friends such as Mr. Stuart M. Samuel, 
whose treasures include a dainty ' procession ' 
of girls bearing flowers, originally sent to 
Euskin upon his birthday, and less elaborate 
but often beautifully finished drawings which 
Kate Greenaway was wont to inclose in letters 
to Mrs. Arthur Severn, and to present to other 
friends as the best thanks within her power 
for kindnesses rendered her. Particularly 
interesting are facsimiles of two pages from a 
tiny MS. bibelot entitled '^Babies and Blos- 
soms,' drawn by Kate Greenaway and written 
by Frederick Locker-Lampson as a surprise for 
his wife, and an original four-page story writ- 
ten and illustrated by Miss Greenaway for Mrs. 
Severn's daughter Violet. 

Euskin and Kate Greenaway did not meet 
until 1882, but his first letter to her, composed 
in a delightfully fantastic vein, was written in 
December of 1879, probably at the suggestion 
of her good friend and sincere though kindly 
critic, Mr. H. Stacy Marks. At that time Miss 
Greenaway was already famous. Her Christ- 
mas cards and her illustrations ranked with 
or above Walter Crane's and Caldecott's; she 
had been admired, imitated, caricatured in 
' Punch,' and pirated in Germany and Belgium. 
' The Birthday Book ' had been issued and had 
prompted Stevenson to try his hand at verses 
for children; and French and English critics 
had vied with one another in admiration for 
the unaffected beauty, delicate humor, and 
exquisite technique of the drawings in ' Under 
the Window.' Euskin had had much to say 
of her feeling for children, and had hesitated 
for some time, wishing to write to her but 
fearing to write harmfully, before he finally 
ventured to address her. The punctuation in 
these quotations, as in all the letters, follows 
Euskin's curious custom of substituting dashes 
of various lengths for commas, semicolons, 
and colons. He writes: 

' My dear Miss Greenaway — I lay awake half (no 
a quarter) of last night thinking of the hundred 
things I want to say to you — and never shall get 
said! — and I'm giddy and weary — and now can't 
even say half or a quarter of one out of the hun- 
dred. They're about you — and your gifts — and 
your graces — and your fancies — ■ and your — yes 
— perhaps one or two little tiny faults. . . . 
Well, of the thousand things — it was nearer a thou- 
sand than a hundred — this is anyhow the first: 
Will you please tell me whether you can only draw 
these things out of your head — or could if you 
chose, draw them with the necessary modifications 
from nature? For instance — ' 

And he goes on to explain that he has seen 
many farm-houses down in Kent and twenty 
children in his parish school that are lovelier 
than any in Kate's book. Only the children 



1905.] 



THE DIAI. 



439 



are 'not like blue china — they are not like 
mushrooms — they are like — very ill-dressed 
angels. Could you draw groups of these as 
they are?.' He goes on to enumerate fourteen 
other items: 

'No. 4 of the thousand: Do you ever see the 
blue sky? and when you do, do you like it? 

*No. 5. Is a witch's ride on a broomstick the 
only chivalry you think it desirable to remind the 
glorious Nineteenth Century of? 

'No. 6. Do you believe in Fairies? 

'No. 7. In ghosts? 

'No. 8. In Principalities and Powers? 

'No. 9. In Heaven? 

'No. 10. In — Anywhere else? 

'No. 11. Did you ever see Chartres Cathedralf 

And so on to No. 15 : * WiU you please forgive 
me — and tell me — some of those things I've 
asked ? ' 

Miss Greenaway responded promptly to this 
comprehensive catechism, and Ruskin wrote 
again, urging her to study nature. A year 
later he goes into raptures over the first orig- 
inal drawing of hers that he has seen. 

'The drawing is so boundlessly more beautiful 
than the wood-cut. . . . These books are lovely 
things but, as far as I can guess, from looking at 
this drawing, your proper work would be in glass 
painting — where your own touch, your own polor, 
would be safe for ever, — seen, in sacred places, by 
multitudes — copied by others, for story books — 
but your whole strength put in pure first perfect- 
ness on the enduring material. Have you ever 
thought of this?' 

There is something almost grotesque in the 
idea of Ruskin, painstaking student of nature 
in her every least manifestation, exercising 
his critical faculty in perfect seriousness upon 
'K. G.'s' fairy-like conceptions. It suggests 
inevitably a picture of an elephant trying 
vainly to comprehend and to correct the 
careless Sittings of a gay butterfly. The fact 
that neither Ruskin nor Miss Greenaway seemed 
to be conscious of any such incongruity shows 
more clearly perhaps than any other one thing 
how seriously Kate Greenaway was accepted 
and how highly valued by those who best under- 
stood her ideals and methods. 

Some of Ruskin's detailed criticism is very 
picturesque and amusing. In June, 1883, he 
writes : 

'Now be a good girl and draw some flowers that 
won't look as if their leaves had been in curlpapers 
all night — and some more chairs than one chair — 
with the shade all right and the legs all square — 
and then I'll tell you what you must do next.' 

Again on the loth, from Oxford : 

'I do want some children as they are, — and that 
you should be able to draw a pretty one without 
mittens, and that you should be more interested in 
phases of character. I want your exquisite feelings 
given to teach — not merely to amuse. . . .I'm 
going to do a bit of "Kate" glass directly, for 
some English hall in fairyland. [He had already 
had at least one such window made.] You'll soon 
have proof of the lecture on you!' 



He is forever complaining of the children's 
feet. *I wish some of the children had bare 
feet and that the shoes of the others weren't 
quite so like mussel-shells,' he writes once. 
' Butter boots ' is another of hL apt compari- 
sons. Soon after he complains that 'the feet 
are getting too small,' adding, ' I want you to 
go to Boulogne and take a course of fish-wives 
and wading children.' 

Another bete noir of Ruskin's is the big 
Greenaway hats. He insists that they are 
merely easy substitutes for the back-grounds 
that she cannot draw. He growls about her 
conventionalized landscapes, declares that he 
is ashamed of her ' Language of Flowers,' and 
then, relenting a little, packs off some 'sods' 
for her to paint, ' not to tease you — but they'll 
go on growing and being pleasant companions.' 
She promptly paints one, and he sends off an 
ecstatic telegrEim : ' The sod is quite lovely, 
the best bit of groundwork I ever got done, so 
many thanks, but don't tire yourself so again.' 
Unfortunately Ruskin seldom preserved let- 
ters, and none of Miss Greenaway's to him are 
extant until the years came when he ceased to 
keep up his side of the correspondence. But 
it is clear that she must have displayed a good 
deal of tact in managing her bearish critic. 
He never got really angry, never lost his inter- 
est in her work, which he often refers to in 
such terms as 'lovely, beyond all thanks or 
believeableness or oonceiveableness.' And Kate, 
for her part, went her own way, profiting by 
his excellent advice and very grateful for his 
interest, but quite unhampered by his 'tyran- 
nies,' as he himself once at least called them, 
and taking pains never to let him see a book 
until it was safely printed. 

It was not that he did not admire the virtues 
of her work, but he wanted it to have all the 
virtues. In one of his last letters to her, writ- 
ten from Sandgate, he shows how he values her 
peculiar gift of imagination. 

'You cannot conceive how in my present state 
I envy — that is to say — only in the strongest way, 
long for — the least vestige of imagination, such 
as yours. When nothing shows itself to me — all 
day long — but the dull room or the wild sea and 
I think what it must be to you to have far sight 
into dreamlands of truth — and to be able to see 
such scenes of the most exquisite grace and Ufa 
and quaint vivacity — whether you draw them or 
not, what a blessing to have them there — at your 
call. And then I stopped and have been lying back 
in my chair the last quarter of an hour, — thinking 
— If I could only let you feel for only a quarter 
of an hour what it is to have no imagination — no 
power of calling up lovely things — no guidance of 
pencil point along the visionary line. Oh, how 
thankful you would be to find your mind again. 

' And what lovely work you have spent — where 
no one will ever see it but poor me — on the lightest 
of your messages. . . . Well, I had joy out of 
them — such as you meant — and more than ever I 
could tell vou. '

THE DIAJL 



[Dec. 16, 



It is a pity that space is lacking to quote 
from the occasional letters in which Euskin 
speaks more fully of himself — of his battles 
at Oxford with atheistic scientists and careless 
students, of his greater battle with himself and 
the gathering shadows, of the flowers he loves 
best and the novels he detests most, of his 
autobiography that is going to be ' so dull ' and 
'so meek,' of the reasons why clouds float, of 
the weather, without and within. 

Kate's letters to him, in spite of the difficulty 
under which she wrote, without the inspiration 
of answers, are charming — always sympa- 
thetic, always cheerful, 'newsy,' and character- 
istic. Writing from London to the recluse at 
Brantwood she naturally speaks often of the 
art exhibits she attends. Her favorite adjec- 
tive for the very modem painters is ' funny,' 
and generally she writes it all in capitals. It 
is this quality of artless frankness in her letters, 
their ingenuous merriment, their abandoned 
joy in the beauty of the earth, rather than 
their literary finish, that gives them charm. 

As the years go on there are hints of depres- 
sion, of a feeling that she is being superseded 
and ' forgotten ' in spite of all her efforts. But 
this is not dwelt upon. The impression left 
by the biography is of a personality at once 
gay and serious ; of a life spent in hard endeavor 
towards high ends, and reaping great reward 
in achievement, in friendship, and in the pop- 
ular favor which measures achievement; of a 
career rounded and closed before it has grown 
burdensome. Edith Kellogo Dunton. 



The Rescue of Religion.* 



A few years ago, Mr. W. H. Mallock gave 
us ' Eeligion as a Credible Doctrine.' This 
work, notwithstanding the title, was mainly 
devoted to the pulverization of the religious 
apologists ; but nevertheless, it presented at the 
end cogent reasons for still maintaining the 
general religious position. The same author's 
new book now before us is, as it were, a new 
edition of the old, with the proportions altered. 
It would not be truly Mallockian if it did not 
hold up for exhibition the weaknesses of pre- 
vious writers, and indeed it does this through- 
out; but it does much more, it seeks to present 
the fundamental axioms of religion in such a 
way that they can be accepted, — not in spite 
of, but rather because of, modern scientific 
knowledge. Passing over the introduction, 
which contains some curiously poor verses, we 
find a closely-reasoned argument continued 
from the first page to the last, with little pause 

♦The Reconstruction of Religious Belief. By W. H. 
Mallock. New York : Harper & Brothers. 



for breath. It is a book to be read at a single 
sitting, like a good novel. To say that it is 
interesting, well written, and appropriate to 
the times, is to offer it the merest justice; but 
to describe it as a complete success is perhaps 
going too far. Perhaps it would be more suc- 
cessful if it were less complete. 

Belief, it is observed, is necessary to our con- 
tinued existence. Daily and hourly — from 
minute to minute — we act in accordance with 
our beliefs. These beliefs are founded, we com- 
monly say, on experience ; but when we attempt 
their logical analysis we sooner or later find 
ourselves confronted by absurd contradictions. 

'If the conception of freedom eludes and baffles 
the intellect, so in their last analysis do our con- 
ceptions of everything. As Spencer has shown, we 
cannot, without self-contradiction, conceive space, 
or matter, or motion, or causation, or our own con- 
scious existence. Our consciousness is always a con- 
sciousness of the present moment; but the present 
moment is an ever disappearing point, which has 
gone before we can name it — which holds all, and 
yet is nothing. . . . Matter has three dimen- 
sions, yet resolves itself into points with none. 
Nothing can be thought of as not having a cause; 
yet all causes end at last in an Absolute which can 
cause nothing; and if we look on this Absolute as 
an absolute yet personal God, God, asi Dean Mansel 
shows us, is all the unthinkables in one' (p. 272). 

Hence the religious difficulty is, at heart, the 
same as the scientific difficulty, and all we can 
say about it is, that it appears to be insoluble 
by the human intellect. 

Are we, then to hold ourselves lost? By no 
means; for just as in the ordinary affairs of 
life we depend upon the practical beliefs we 
have reached, so in higher matters must we 
rest upon the verities of religion, for the sake 
of our own sanity and the progress of civiliza- 
tion. What are these higher matters, and what 
are the verities of religion? Logic does not 
tell us; science, as a logical system, knows no 
higher or lower, better or worse. Yet, as we 
live, we may not, cannot, abandon our system 
of values, or admit that good and bad, higher 
and lower, beauty and ugliness, are one and the 
same thing. If the cosmos has no soul, if we 
ourselves are but bubbles formed in an instant 
and bursting in the next, if all we do, think, 
or say was predetermined in infinity, the very 
meaning of the higher life is lost. Man has 
tediously climbed the ladder of evolution, until 
at length he seems to see over the housetops 
the distant hills ; and is he now to be told that 
they are a figment of his imagination ? He will 
not be so stultified, logic or no logic. 

Granting so much, do we therefore grant 
anything and everything? The sublime noto- 
riously borders on the ridiculous, and when 
the other day I heard an orthodox clergyman 
gravely maintain that God had a throne set 
up in a certain part of the heavens, I could

THE DTAT.

only suppose >n'm to be wanting in a sense of 
humor. The truth of the matter is, that it will 
not do to confuse the ultimate illogicality of 
things, as they necessarily appear to our minds, 
with a system of thought which for everyday 
practical purposes will not work. We believe 
in the freedom of the will, within limitations, 
as a practical necessity ; but to hold at the same 
time some of the traditions of theology and the 
theories of science, or even the opinions result- 
ing from common experience, is like caging 
together two furious beasts, which can by no 
means endure one another. As 0. W. Holmes 
said, the scandalous thing is not that such 
combinations make people insane, but that 
people profess to hold by them and retain their 
sanity. 

But the religious apologist will say, that is 
true; but turn out the scientific beast, not the 
religious one ! ^Vhy cannot we do that ? Ulti- 
mately for the practical reason that the scien- 
tific animal will and does serve us in a thousand 
ways, and is always ready to come at our call; 
while the other is shy and cantankerous, to 
say the least. If we were monomaniacs, it 
might be different. 

Here is the whole point of Mr. Mallock's 
contention. The religious beast has got to go; 
there is no reasonable doubt about that; but 
must religion go with it? If it must, the end 
of human progress, as we understand it, has 
come; but it must not, and moreover, cannot, 
in the nature of things. The clergy are too 
wedded to old traditions, and too ignorant of 
science, to afford much help; the scientific are 
for the most part too narrow; and hence the 
inevitable new birth is not an easy one, and 
the transition period is one in which men seem 
cast adrift. The very psychological conditions 
which made the coming of Christ so opportune 
1900 years ago, have arisen again. 

I have not attempted to reconstruct Mr. 
Malloclrs argument in this short review, but 
merely to describe his general purpose. Neither 
has it seemed worth while to offer detailed 
criticism, though * science/ as understood by 
many, is likely to repudiate such things as the 
inheritance of sense-impressions described on 
p. 37. There remains, however, a more funda- 
mental objection. Mr. Mallock says: 

'We must, then, recognize anthropomorphism, un- 
derstood with certain limitations, as providing us 
with what is not only not an illegitimate, but the 
sole scientific means, of approaching the problem of 
the ultimate character of the universe. Just now 
we compared the Unknowable First Cause, as 
Haeckel, Spencer, and their whole school represent 
it, to a seemingly blank slab which when cleaned 
by a further application of the methods of these 
thinkers themselves, is seen to be covered with in- 
numerable cryptic inscriptions; and we asked 
whether it were possible to discover any Bosetta 
Stone — any bilingual tablet — by means of which 



we might be able to spell out a part of them; and 
here we have our answer. The Bosetta Stone of 
the universe for ourselves is the human brain, in 
which matter and conscious mind are immediately 
presented to us as identical, and we are able to 
watch reality at work under its two aspects' 
(p. 1<9). 

This attractive idea is developed at consid- 
erable length, with the result of apparently 
justifying, or at least rendering more or less 
probable, the existence of a cosmic God. The 
objection which may at once be raised to it is 
this: that the human mind cannot be thought 
of as cosmic and omnipotent. Our very 
thought — the emergence of cerebration into 
the field of consciousness — depends upon the 
existence of active conflict, and upon the reac- 
tions between personality and non-personality. 
If the absence of free-will is untiunkable, so 
equally is unrestrained free-will: it is like the 
conception of pushing with nothing to push. 
The human mind or personality, magnified 
into a cosmic Grod, would be exactly the blank 
slab which Haeckel and Spencer are said to 
have depicted, and while the conception might 
have value in philosophic discussions, it could 
have nothing whatever to do with religion. 
^Monotheism carried to its logical extreme is 
Pantheism, and possesses no reality which the 
human intellect can grasp. The reaUy religious 
man cries 'My God,' and while he may postu- 
late an omnipotent and cosmic deity, in reality 
he addresses himself to his spiritual father or 
friend, who is thought of as one like himself 
only immensely superior. Philosophically, it 
is perfectly reasonable to hold that each man's 
individual God is a phase or aspect of spiritual 
totality, just as each man's garden is a phase 
or aspect of material totality; but for the pur- 
poses of living religion, each must have his 
own special deity, who ministers in special ways 
to his needs. Thus some of the creeds of 
paganism are seen to be more genuinely alive 
and purposeful than we have been wont to 
assume, and polytheism is no longer a word of 
reproach, but a reasonable projection of the 
diverse aspirations of mankind.

Hexrt James: Ax Appreciation.* 

All of Miss Gary's work in biography and 
criticism is marked by the distinct note of 
appreciation. In such a spirit she has studied 
Rossetti and William Morris, Tennyson, Brown- 
ing, and Emerson. She brings her reader into 
close touch with the mental and spiritual traits 
of each author, and leaves him with a deeper

THE DIAL. 



[Dec. 16, 



impression of the general influences of the sub- 
ject chosen for study. In her latest volume, a 
critical interpretation of the novels of Mr. 
Henry James, she has found a theme well suited 
to her powers of insight and illumination. 

In an introductory chapter various questions 
are raised regarding the influence of Mr. James 
upon his readers, — such as whether or not their 
minds are enriched by his fiction, and whether 
his work tends to quicken the vision and grasp 
of beauty in art, in character, and in the external 
world. From the first we are assured that to 
Miss Gary, as to all admiring readers of Mr. 
James, the answers to such queries must be 
strongly affirmative. Tracing his early work, 
with ii^ ' promise of triumph over the common- 
place,^ following his years of ripening amid Eng- 
lish and Continental influences, emphasizing his 
French mode of style with its 'rich density of 
detail,' Miss Gary reaches her first general asser- 
tion of Mr. James's highest ideal as critic and 
novelist alike, — to combine ' what a critic of 
painting would call tactile values with the 
greatest amount of spiritual truth.' 

In the second chapter, on * American Ghar- 
acter,' one finds an excellent review of Mr. 
James's attitude towards the salient and inci- 
dental qualities of Americans, from his first 
studies in ' Watch and Ward ' and ' Roderick 
Hudson ' to * The Ambassadors.' Miss Gary, 
like her subject, is constantly ' striking matches ' 
for our enlightenment on her theme, while, 
with keen phrase, she says that Mr. James has 
written, not a Comedie Hummne but, in large 
measure, a Comedie Sociah, dealing with the 
mental and social contacts of Americans and 
Europeans. With amusement, that is also echo, 
we read in the same chapter this sentence, bear- 
ing directly upon ' Roderick Hudson ' but ap- 
plicable to much of the author's character-delin- 
eation: ^All through the book people explain 
themselves to each other and explain each other 
to themselves.' ^The Genius of Places,' that 
intense feeling which Mr. James shows for 
certain houses and surroundings, gives theme 
to another chapter, with special illustrations 
from ' The Portrait of a Lady.' A consideration 
of ' The Question of Wealth,' interpreted from 
their attitude toward wealth of Mr. James's 
characters, from Isabel Archer and Adam 
Verver to the stupid and gross spenders in 
'The Spoils of Poynton,' leads on to the con- 
clusion that ' appreciation of the two kinds and 
uses of wealth, the material and the immaterial, 
— this, perhaps, is the marked characteristic of 
his representation of society in which the " pic- 
ture and the idea" are present in such even 
proportion.' Under the elastic title of ' Imag- 
ination ' are introduced anew queries regarding 
the universal truth and the real expressiveness 



of the novelist's characters. Recognizing that 
the conscious appreciation of such women as 
Maisie, Nanda, Maggie, and Maria Gostrey must 
come slowly. Miss Gary justly lays stress upon 
the staying quality of their images when once 
they are impressed. With discrimination she 
points out that Mr. James does not dissect his 
characters, but rather he builds them up syn- 
thetically and slowly, to gain large effects. Of 
her author's symbolism and swift psychological 
images she says, with personal zest : ' From the 
point of view of one who likes it, such an exer- 
cise of the imagination brings back the delicious 
early sense of living in a fairy-tale, but without 
the sacrifice of our later sense of reality. We 
gain from it both the show of things and their 
significance, both the fable and the moral, both 
the text and the picture.' 

If there is weakness anywhere in this interest- 
ing and luminous* study it is in the chapter on 
* Philosophy.' One wishes that more expansion 
of Mr. James's moral and psychologic messages 
had been included. With happy metaphor the 
author speaks of the difficulties in the way of 
such study — ' It is easy, no doubt, in a wood so 
closely set with handsome growth, to see only 
the trees.' Questioning if Mr. James has fol- 
lowed his own ideals as set forth in 'The Art 
of Fiction,' Miss Gary finds in him a judicial 
mind and a constant presentation of some moral 
or intellectual problem, frequently a problem of 
choice. An exhaustive bibliography by Mr. 
Frederick Allen King, arranged logically as well 
as chronologically, is a valuable adjunct to the 
chapters by Miss Gary.

One of the most elaborate, as well as one of 
the most authoritative, art books of the season 
is Mr. Gustave Geffrey's aecount of ' The Na- 
tional Gallery ' of London, published by Messrs. 
Frederick Warne & Co. in a volume copiously 
illustrated with over fifty full-page photogra- 
vures and nearly three times as many pictures 
in the text. An introduction by Sir Walter Arm- 
strong, director of the Irish National Gallery 
and an illuminating critic, traces briefly but com- 
prehensively the history of the English National 
Gallery from its foundation in 1824 to the pres- 
ent time. The terse but scholarly method of the 
introduction is followed in the rest of the book. 
Mr. Geffroy writes in succession of each of the 
seven great schools of painting represented in the 
Gallery, treating in separate articles certain 
eminent groups of painters or, in a few cases, 
an individual artist. A special point is made of 
the origins of each school and of its development 
from one phase to another, so that each division

THE DIAli

of the book is unified through much detail. Mr. 
Geffroy's criticism is descriptive and aesthetic, 
as well as historical, and occasionally biographi- 
cal, when biographical data are essential to the 
interpretation and understanding of any paint- 
ing. His style is often brilliant, and always 
clear and definite. The book is not primarily a 
history of isolated schools; it is an account and 
a comparative estimate of those schools as they 
are represented in the English Gallery, and 
there is constant reference to the influence of 
all the groups upon the English painters. To 
the native school in its various characteristic 
manifestations one-third of the space available 
in the volume is allotted. In these days of 
splendid illustrating almost nothing is any longer 
astonishing, but it may safely be said that even 
today a more luxuriously and satisfactorily 
illustrated book would be hard to find. The 
more notable pictures, and those containing 
masses of detail, are reproduced in full-page 
size, and the smaller half-tones are very effect- 
ive for portraits and for some types of landscape. 
The volume, which is of quarto size, would make 
an excellent guide-book for visitors to the Gal- 
lery, but it seems to be planned more particu- 
larly for the leisurely study that comes before 
or between pilgrimages to London, and its scope 
and ample illustration, together with the great 
variety of types represented between its covers, 
make it an excellent volume with which to start 
one's artistic training. 

If it be possible to say of a city, as it was said 
once of a woman, 'to have loved her is a liberal 
education,' that city is Florence. A certain ex- 
travagance of language that would be out of 
place in writing of other cities is quite pardon- 
able when Florence is the theme. 'Flower of 
all Cities and Cities of all Flowers' is the char- 
acterization of Miss Lilian "Whiting in her latest 
book, 'The Florence of Landor' (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) ; and whoever in the early Spring has 
climbed up the green slopes of Fiesole, or the 
opposite height of San Miniato, and looked down 
upon the marble town with its cupolas and roofs 
buried in a sea of blossoms, will appreciate the 
appellation. Though literary Florence is less 
well-known than artistic Florence, it is no less 
fascinating. Of the Anglo-Florentines who 
formed there such a brilliant literary group dur- 
ing the middle years of the nineteenth century, 
one of the earliest to come and longest to remain 
was Walter Savage Landor. For this reason, 
and not because Landor was in any sense a per- 
sonal centre (his personal aflBliations were too 
limited for that), Miss Whiting uses 'The Flor- 
ence of Landor' as a title to cover the more 
distinctively literary life of the city from 1821, 
when Landor came to Florence, to 1864, when 
he died there. Certainly those were great days, 
and Miss Whiting's book contains many happy 
pictures of the social life of this inner circle of 
choice spirits,— 'moonlight gatherings on the ter- 
race of some old palazzo, where Italian politics 
and poetry were discussed over tea and straw- 
berries, or at chance encounters in galleries or 



churches where the conversational interludes of 
sympathetic companionship were resimaed.' 
There are so many good things in Miss Whit- 
ing's book, that the pity is all the greater that 
the writer has never acquired the literary virtues 
of restraint and selection; although in this vol- 
ume she offends less than usual, her pen too 
often runs away into merely 'fine' writing, upon 
topics quite out of place. Then, too, before the 
book goes into another edition, the publishers 
should have the proofs read by some one familiar 
with Italian proper names. A number of excel- 
lent half-tone reproductions, mainly from photo- 
graphs of Florentine buildings and scenery, 
illustrate the volume. 

' With Shelley in Italy, ' by Mrs. Anna Benneson 
McMahan, is an illuminating commentary upon 
the Italian influences that made Shelley, one 
bound to be a great poet in any environment, ' the 
particular kind of great poet that he is.' The 
book takes the form of an anthology of extracts 
from the poems, letters, and note-books written 
between 1818 and the poet's death, with brief 
introductory comments by the editor upon the 
circumstances under which Shelley lived and 
worked in each of the five short years that were 
left to him. The book is published by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. in a sumptuous large-paper 
edition limited to two hundred and fifty copies. 
The binding is of grey boards, with gold decora- 
tions and vellum back. Nearly seventy-five pho- 
tographs, including some taken expressly for this 
book, are reproduced in tint, by way of recalling 
pictorially Shelley's Italian environment. Mrs. 
McMahan has made no addition to our already 
abundant supply of 'chatter about Harriet'; her 
interest in Shelley lies on quite another plane. 
In her general introduction she recalls Dr. Richard 
Garnett's statement that the great obstacles to 
a general comprehension of the poet were 'his 
erudition and the Italian atmosphere which envel- 
ops much of his poetry. ' In the twenty-five years 
since this comment was uttered, the erudition has 
been pretty thoroughly annotated, but Mrs. 
McMahan 's is the first attempt to set the poems 
in their original environment, by illustration, and 
by grouping them with apposite passages from 
the letters and note-books, ' so that the poems may 
be seen in the making, so to speak.' This is the 
compiler's object, and she accomplishes it in a 
wav that leaves no need for further justification. 
Shelley's note to his 'Ode to the West Wind' 
gains new significance when it is printed below a 
photograph of the 'wood that skirts the Amo* 
to which it refers, and the Italian spirit of even 
so universal a bit of literature as the ' Ode ' comes 
suddenly to the fore in the reader's enjoyment. 
Descriptive passages in other poems and the 
extracts from the dramas gain greatly in interest 
when read in connection with Shelley's almost 
impassioned account of the experiences that 
brought them into being. Mrs. McMahan 's own 
writing fills less than a score of her pages, — a 
fact testifying to her marked ability to speak 
briefly and to the point. 

Mr. H. Noel Williams, who has written popular 
studies of Madame Recamier, Madame Du Barry, 



444 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Madame Pompadour, and other French wits, 
beauties, and 'queens of the left hand,' has 
published a new volume along somewhat the 
same lines, entitled 'Queens of the Trench Stage' 
(imported by Scribner). In this new work he 
discusses in turn Madame Moliere; Marie de 
Champmesle, Racine's interpreter and mistress; 
Adrienne Leeouvreur, whose romantic history 
and tragic death lend themselves easily to exploi- 
tation; and several others of the artistic fore- 
bears of Mesdames Bernhardt and Rejane. Mr. 
Williams gives both the 'backstairs' and the 
theatrical biography of his subjects. Having ap- 
parently delved deeply into contemporary rec- 
ords, he speaks with authority, citing sources in 
foot-notes, and sometimes assembling a rather 
tiresome array of proofs. Written in clear, vig- 
orous style, the book makes interesting, if not 
very stimulating reading. Its greatest value lies 
in the glimpses which it affords of late seven- 
teenth and early eighteenth century French soci- 
ety, and of the attitude of that society toward 
the actor. The picture is not a pleasant one, for 
the book resolves itself into the story of liaisons, 
jealousies, infidelities, intrigues, and scandals in 
high life and low. The history of triumphs and 
failures on the stage is subordinated to the more 
significant history of romances in the wings and 
the green-room; and we are given unprofitable 
side-lights on those who deserve remembrance 
simply as artistic or historic personages. For 
those who played so brilliantly before the foot- 
lights often played at the game of life very 
badly, if one judges them by twentieth century 
and Anglo-Saxon standards. The book, a sub- 
stantial volume of some three hundred and fifty 
quarto pages, is pleasantly illustrated with eight 
or ten full-page half-tone reproductions after 
contemporary drawings or paintings. A photo- 
gravure from a famous portrait of Adrienne Le- 
eouvreur serves as frontispiece. 

Mr. George Wharton James is an indefatigable 
exploiter of the romance of the great West,— not 
the West of the gold rush, the gallant cow-boy, or 
the picturesquely adventurous prospector, but the 
West of the Indian, whether he be the present-day 
basket-maker, living peacefully on his reserva- 
tion, or the savage convert of the Spanish padres, 
whose crusade to Alta California began at about 
the time of our revolution and came to an end 
a dozen years before the territory's annexation. 
It is this particular phase of his subject that 
engages Mr. James's attention in his latest book, 
'In and Out of the Old Missions' (Little, Brown, 
& Co.). Finding this theme still too broad to be 
handled in one volume without undue condensa- 
tion, Mr. James further limits it in his preface to 
California missions, promising a companion vol- 
ume upon those of New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, 
and Lower California. Full and beautiful illus- 
tration is always a feature of Mr, James 's books. 
This new one contains over sixty pages which 
reproduce one hundred and forty-two photographs 
of Mission art and architecture, and of street 
scenes and Indian types to be found in Mission 
villages. For the bulk of his work Mr. James 



claims no particular originality. The origin and 
development of the Missions, the noble deeds they 
enshrined, the good they did and tried to do for 
the Indian, have been already treated by experts, 
from whose works Mr. James has supplemented 
the impressions gained by personal pilgrimages 
stretching over a period of twenty-five years. 
But certain points have never been presented, or 
presented so fully, before : for example, the origin 
and the detailed style of Mission architecture, 
and its influence upon modem architecture in the 
United States; the mural decorations, the wood- 
carving, the silver and brass ware, and the figures 
of saints, in the Missions; and some others. A 
cursory survey of the book, which extends to 
nearly four hundred pages, finds it an interesting 
and adequate treatment of a fascinating theme. 

Similar in general style of make-up and also 
in intention— that of pleasing the 'arm-chair' 
traveller, without disregarding the needs of his 
fellow who journeys by road and rail— are two 
books published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co., 
entitled respectively 'Rambles in Brittany' and 
'Among French Inns.' The former is the fifth 
volume of French sketches which Mr. Francis 
Miltoun has written. It is the informal record of 
many journeys and rambles, rather off the beaten 
track of tourist travel. Maps, plans, diagrams, 
and an index to places will be useful to all classes 
of readers. There are general chapters on the 
history, topography, and customs of the province, 
and detailed accounts of certain regions. A 
delightful feature of the volume is Mrs. Blanche 
McManus's picturesque drawings of the country, 
the architectural monuments, and the people. 
These, reproduced in tint, with an ornamental 
cover of heavy buckram, give the book an attrac- 
tive holiday air.— Mr. Charles Gibson, author of 
'Among French Inns,' has a very unfortunate 
literary style. He defaces almost every page of 
his book by his badly chosen vocabulary or his 
disregard for the rules of English syntax. To 
quote only one sentence from a page which fur- 
nishes several examples, equally forcible, Mr. 
Gibson says in describing the market-place at 
Caudebec: 'Here we hear the cackle of the hen, 
and observe the young calf elongate his soft, pink 
tongue in gentle endearment.' And so, though 
Mr, Gibson tells us a great many interesting 
things about Normandy, we cannot feel that his 
text is worthy of the elaborate embellishment 
which is given it by over thirty tinted reproduc- 
tions of photographs, prettily designed end-pa- 
pers, and an alluring cover. 

In response to an urgent demand for more 
Uncle Remus stories, Mr. Joel Chandler Harris 
has written 'Told by Uncle Remus' (McClure, 
Phillips & Co.), a collection of new stories of 
negro folklore, which are permeated by the same 
sly humor that has given Uncle Remus his unique 
position among lovers of good stories. Brer 
Rabbit, Brer Fox, Brer Wolf, and all the rest 
of the gay brotherhood reappear in the new 
book, and Messrs. Frost, Conde, and Verbeck 
have contributed pictures, in full-page size and 
also in little vignettes that are quite as eharae-

teristie. 'The Reason Why' is the name of the 
introductory story, which tells how Uncle 
Remus, after years of silence, happened to begin 
story-telling again. The reason is as ingenious 
and convincing as if an excuse for such a pro- 
ceeding was really needed. The stories explain 
such interesting matters as 'Why Mr. Cricket 
Has Elbows on His Legs,' 'How Wiley Wolf 
Rode in the Bag,' 'When Brother Rabbit Was 
King,' 'Why Mr. Dog is Lame,' and many others. 
Uncle Remus has presumably aged somewhat 
since his first appearance, but his story-telling 
faculty is unimpaired by time and disuse. 

Between the diverting humor of Mr. Oliver 
Herford's verses and the same humor in its pic- 
torial manifestations, it is hard to choose, partic- 
ularly since the two together make such a 
delightful haimony. In his new book, ' The Fairy 
Godmother-in-Law ' (Scribner), Mr. Herford has 
made the illustrative features rather less promi- 
nent than usual. The little pen-and-ink drawings 
are characteristically clever and original, but the 
verses are the piece de rSsistance. The first story, 
which gives the book its title, is an engaging 
sequel to Cinderella. As Mr. Herford puts the 
matter in the preface : 

'It is not always well to place 
Unbounded Faith in Fairy Lore, 
Believing that in every case 
They all lived Happy ever more. 

'Stranger than Fiction though we deem 
The Truth, it does not follow, too. 
That Fairy Tales, because they seem 
Still stranger, must be still more true. 

'Far be it from me to assail 
The Truthfulness of Fairy Writ, 
But let us take a Well-known Tale, 
And see what really came of it.' 

Some of the other verses embody Mr. Herford 's 
corrections of myths and fairy tales; and others, 
like 'The Bachelor Girl' and 'A Modern Dia- 
logue,' have no such basis. But all exhibit their 
author's genius at maxiipulating rhyme, meter, 
and sense so as to carry out his humorous pur- 
poses. 

'The Travel Lover's Library' of Messrs. L. C. 
Page & Co. is augmented by a study of 'China 
and her People' edited from the work of the late 
Col. Charles Denby, who was for the thirteen 
years following 1885 United States Minister at 
Pekin. Like the other numbers in the 'Travel 
Lover's Library,' this new work is in two handy- 
sized volumes. The first volume is filled with 
reminiscences of the author's stay in China and 
his personal impressions of the land and the 
people, and with accounts of court life at Pekin 
and social life and customs elsewhere in the king- 
dom. The second volume is concerned with 
Chinese politics and industrial and commercial 
problems and conditions. The lucid statements 
of the causes of the Russo-Japanese war and of 
the arguments for the 'Open Door' policy, the 
chapters on the Boxer rebellion, the foreign 
missionaries, and the immigration question, are 
all of interest and some value, as coming from a 
man who was in a position to know the facts 



and therefore has a right to his theories about 
them. In general, the topics dealt with in both 
volumes are of the sort that would naturally 
interest a man of affairs, and Colonel Denby 's 
method of treating them will appeal particularly 
to masculine readers. In accordance with the 
plan of the series, the volimies are profusely 
illustrated with reproductions of photographs 
collected by the author. 

'Normandy in Colour' (Dent-Dutton), by Mr. 
Gordon Home, is chiefly of interest for its beau- 
tiful colored plates, which give clearer impressions 
of Noi-many's varied and wonderful scenery, her 
splendid churches and chateaux, her quaint and 
narrow streets, and her poplar-shaded country 
roads, than any words, however perfectly chosen, 
could hope to do. But Mr. Home is sufiiciently 
an artist to write, as well as paint, like one. He 
wins the reader's approbation by his first sen- 
tence. ' Very large ants, magpies in every meadow, 
and coffee cups without handles, but of great 
girth,' are the objects he seizes upon as par- 
ticularly indicative of the differences between 
Normandy and Devonshire. The same feeling for 
effective detail permeates all Mr. Home's pen 
pictures of Normandy. His method of treatment 
is purely impressionistic. He tells the reader 
what pleasures await him in Normandy, leaving 
to Baedeker the purveying of those hard facts 
about historical association and other like mat- 
ters which, however profitable to the traveller, 
are devoid of literary or artistic value. 

Mr. Gustav Kobbe's 'Famous Actors and Act- 
resses and their Homes,' first issued two years 
ago, re-appears in two handy-sized volumes, 
bound in red cloth and neatly boxed, as one of 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co.'s 'Holiday Art Sets.' 
These sketches are deservedly popular, for they 
combine dignity with interest, in a field where 
such a combination is rarely achieved. The thirty 
full-page plates and forty illustrations in the 
text, which belonged to the original edition, have 
been retained in the reprint. Devotees of the 
modern stage will be glad to have their Christ- 
mases remembered with a gift of these tasteful 
volumes. 

Mr. Kobbe is at his best in writing of his 
contemporaries, whom he lets us know with an 
intimacy that never degenerates into vulgar gos- 
siping. But his new volume, 'The Loves of 
Great Composers' (Crowell), may also be com- 
mended among works of its class. It details the 
romantic attachments of Mozart, Beethoven, 
Mendelssohn, Chopin, the Schumanns, Liszt, and 
Wagner, giving some new facts and correcting 
some familiar errors. The accounts are enter- 
taining, and the reader is grateful for their com- 
plete avoidance of sentimental rhapsodizing. The 
book is printed with rubricated headings and 
initials, and contains twenty-four full-page illus- 
trations in tint, reproducing portraits of the 
composers and the women they loved. 

Mr. Harold MacGrath knows how to write 
stories whose plots, though they seem fantastic 
enough in the light of a subsequent cool consider- 
ation, are constructed with aji art that holds the 
reader 's interest from the first page to the last, —

and makes him wish there was more to follow. 
Such a story was 'The Man on the Box' and such 
another is 'Hearts and Masks' (Bobbs-Merrill 
Co.). The new book is published with photogra- 
vure illustrations by Mr. Harrison Fisher and a 
dainty cover that give it the air of a holiday 
novelette ; but it is besides that a thoroughly good 
story. The hero and heroine are both of the 
adventurous, Bohemian type, who make excite- 
ment when it does not come ready-made. How 
they went to a masked ball, at which New York 's 
prize detective and New York's mysterious gentle- 
man burglar also happened to be present, and to 
what purpose they passed their evening, should 
be left entirely to Mr. MaeGrath's effective 
telling. Holiday gift-hunters who want a book 
that is at once pretty and entertaining need not 
go further than 'Hearts and Masks.' 

Admirers of Mr. Harry Graham's 'Misrepre- 
sentative Men' will be glad to hear that 'More 
Misrepresentative Men' is now ready for their 
perusal. The patriotism of William Waldorf 
Astor, Henry the Eighth's 'passion for domestic 
life,' Sherlock Holmes's 'placid, penetrating 
eyes,' and other themes as pertinent are treated 
in verse, in Mr. Graham's wittily merciless fash- 
ion. Mr. Malcolm Strauss contributes carica- 
tures of the various 'misrepresentative men.' — 
Another cleverly humorous booklet published by 
the same house (Fox, Duffield & Co.) is 'The 
Fusser's Book,' which is issued in a new and 
larger edition this year. 'Fussers' of both 
sexes will find the rules of the game as laid down 
by the Misses Anna Archbald and Georgina 
Jones extremely useful and adapted to all pos- 
sible and impossible cases; and they are so 
cleverly stated that they can more easily be re- 
membered than forgotten. Appropriate pic- 
tures and cover design by Miss Florence Wjinan 
add the finishing touch to a book that will amuse 
both 'fussers' and those who would like to 
have the word 'fusser' defined. 

In his new book called 'Romances of Old 
France' (Baker & Taylor Co.) Mr. Richard Le 
Gallienne re-tells half a dozen more tales of 
media)val devotion, very similar in spirit to those 
that made up his previous volume of 'Old Love 
Stories Retold.' 'Amis and Amile' and 'Aucas- 
sin and Nicolete' will be familiar to most read- 
ers, at least in outline; but they are charming 
enough to stand repetition. 'The Tale of King 
Coustans the Emperor' and 'King Floras and 
the Fair Jehane' have already been re-discovered 
and modernized by William Morris, from whose 
versions Mr. Le Gallienne quotes at length. The 
other two stories he seems to have brought 
straight from the original text. Mr. Le Gal- 
lienne 's style is graceful, piquant, and spirited 
"Without being archaic; and he tells as much of 
the stories as most readers will care to hear. 
The volume is daintily bound in gray boards, 
with the picture of a knight just leaving his 
castle vignetted into the front cover. A frontis- 
piece and occasional border vignettes placed in 
the generous margins comprise the other decora- 
tive features. 



'In Bohemia' is the title of a uniquely bound 
and prettily decorated booklet containing a med- 
ley of verse and prose sketches by Mr. James 
Clarence Harvey. The author tells the unin- 
itiated how to go to Bohemia and what they may 
reasonably expect to find there, making a special 
point of the distinction between the false and 
the true Bohemianism, whether it is found in 
New York or Damascus. Some of the verse in 
dialect is very clever. — Similar in general make- 
up, but more original in content, is 'The Log of 
the Water Wagon; or, The Cruise of the Good 
Ship "Lithia." ' Messrs. Bert Leston Taylor 
and W. C. Gibson are responsible for the text, 
and Mr. L. M. Glackens for the pictures and 
decorations. The dedication is 'To all surviving 
passengers of the good ship "Lithia," ' and the 
editor's note explains how the log was compiled 
from memoranda 'found in a floating milk-bottle 
with a patent stopper, flung overboard just before 
the good ship 'Lithia' foundered in a fearful 
simoon. . . The notes, penciled in a trembling 
hand, on the backs of blank temperance pledges, 
I U's, and wine lists, were barely legible.' The 
itinerary of the ship, its rules and regulations, 
and sundry moral reflections upon life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of iappiness are added to the 
log, which makes very .amusing reading. Both 
of these booklets are published in attractive 
form by the H. M. Caldwell Co. 

Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. publish, in uniform 
style and binding, two volumes of compilations 
entitled respectively, 'The Art Lovers' Treasury' 
and 'The Music Lovers' Treasury.' The former, 
which is edited by Carrie Thompson Lowell, is 
characterized on the title-page as ' famous pictures 
described in poems.' Forty-eight pictures are 
reproduced in half-tone, and the editor writes a 
running comment, treating a group of paintings 
and sculpture under some general heading, such 
as 'Mythology in Poetry and Sculpture,' 'Legends 
of the Saints, ' or 'Pictures translated into Verse.' 
References to the pictures in poetry, and apposite 
quotations which have suggested themselves to 
the author in connection with some painting, are 
reproduced as occasion occurs. Pictures and 
poetry are thoroughly representative, and the 
arrangement, though necessarily loose, holds the 
reader's interest.— 'The Music Lovers' Treasury,' 
edited by Helen Philbrook Patten, is an antholo- 
gy of poetry, ancient and modern, referring to 
musical themes. There is plenty of variety, both 
in authorship, subject, and literary merit, the 
aim being apparently to appeal to music lovers 
rather than to over-critical literary connoisseurs. 
Half-tones of some twenty-five pictures having 
musical subjects furnish illustrations for a vol- 
ume that certainly merits its title. 

A delightful illustrated edition of 'The Fables 
of Aesop' is published by Messrs. Moffat, Yard 
& Co. The 'Fables' are adapted from the Rev. 
George F. Townsend's translation of the Greek. 
An introduction is furnished by Elisabeth 
Luther Cary, who writes charmingly of the ap- 
peal of the fable to the thoughtful and the 
simple alike, of the authorship of the Aesopian 



1906.]

group, the variant classical forms and the 
French adaptations, and of the illustrations 
which have been made for the work in various 
generations. The present edition is illustrated 
by Mr. J. M. Conde, whose pictures in color and 
line certainly catch something of the spirit of 
the text, if they also miss something more. At 
least they are pictoiially attractive and interest- 
ing, and will take their place with other intelli- 
gent essays at picturing the lurking, whimsical 
humor of the Greek fabulist. 

To the long list of their finely illustrated 
'Photogravure Series' of books of travel, the 
John C. Winston Co. have added a timely work 
upon Russia. The text is not new, being a re- 
production, in translation, of Theophile Gautier's 
graceful interpretation of his Russian joumey- 
ings, first published in 1866. The translation by 
Miss Florence Mclntyre Tyson, prepared espje- 
cially for this edition, is mechanical, but on the 
whole fairly satisfactory. Miss Tj'son also con- 
tributes a final chapter entitled 'Russian Policy 
in the East,' which brings the volume up to 
date in the only respect upon which Russia's 
policy has changed materially between 1866 and 
the signing of the peace protocol, a few months 
ago. Gautier's narrative needs no conmient; it 
touches authoritatively upon Russia's history 
and government, her art, her politics, her army 
and navy, her homes, her public buildings, and 
her amusements. The present work is published 
in two volumes, handsomely bound in red and 
gold, provided with cloth cover slips and boxed. 
Fifty fine photogravures, from photographs of 
public buildings, streets, monuments, and quaint 
peasant customs, illustrate the volumes. 

In 'Shakespeare's Sweetheart,' Miss Sara 
Hawks Sterling has made an interesting essay 
at a romantic interpretation of Shakespeare's 
courtship of Anne Hathaway. The traditional 
account of the matter is relegated to the back- 
ground of the story, and Anne is made the poet 's 
real sweetheart and true love, only temporarily 
supplanted by the fascinating wiles of the Dark 
Lady. The story is told by Anne Hathaway her- 
self, who consents, at the solicitation of Ben Jon- 
son, to set down for posterity an account of her 
husband's private life. The narrative has a de- 
cided dramatic quality, though from the very 
magnitude of the undertaking there are inevi- 
table crudities and faults in both style and atmos- 
phere. But on the whole the situation is han- 
dled skilfully, and the story is a charming bit of 
imaginative writing. The book is published by 
Messrs. George "W. Jacobs & Co., in an orna- 
mental buckram binding, with colored chapter 
and running heads and five striking illustrations 
by Miss Clara Elsene Peck. 

Miss Esther Singleton's series of compilations 
on artistic and historical themes are justly pop- 
ular, for they give the reader who seeks infor- 
mation clear and definite statements enunciated 
by unquestioned authorities. The latest volume 
which Miss Singleton has edited and in part 
translated is entitled 'Great Portraits, as seen 



and described by great writers' (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.). The term 'great writers' is elasticaUy in- 
terpreted to mean competent art critics. The 
portraits are chosen with reference to their fame 
and merit, and also with a view to illustrating 
as many different ideals of portraiture and kinds 
of technique as possible. Each picture is shown 
in an excellent half-tone, which is followed by 
one or two descriptive and critical articles. Por- 
traits treated in Miss Singleton 's ' Great Pictures ' 
or 'Famous Paintings' are omitted here. 

Mr. John Luther Long has turned from the 
flowery land of 'Madame Butterfly' and 'Miss 
Cherry Blossom of Tokio' to write 'a little com- 
edy of country manners' in German-Pennsylvania. 
It is named after its hero ' Seffy, ' which is short 
for Sephenijah Baumgartner. When the story 
opens Seffy is, as his name suggests, rather a 
spiritless hero. In love as in other matters he is 
* f astnaehiek, ' which is Pennsylvania Dutch 
for 'chust about a quarter of an inch too late 
for the prize.' But Seffy learns wisdom— and 
speed— before the end of the story. Old Baum- 
gartner, the father, is a delightful country-store 
philosopher, and it is about him rather than Seffy 
that the interest centres. The novelette is orna- 
mentally bound, and supplied with marg^al 
borders and colored illustrations attractive enough 
to catch the eye of holiday shopj)ers. (Bobbs- 
Merrill Co.) 

'My Lady's Slipper' is the title of a pretty 
holiday novelette, printed with tinted illustra- 
tions and unique border designs. Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. are the publishers, and Mr. Cyrus 
Townsend Brady the author. The latter assures 
us that though Doctor Franklin and Commodore 
Paul Jones, not to mention the King and Queen 
of France, are among its characters, nevertheless 
the book is not an historical novel. 'There is no 
history in it unless it be another version of a 
thing that has happened since the beginning of 
time and which is therefore a part of all history — 
the love story.' Master Francis Burnham is the 
American hero of this dainty Parisian romance, 
and the heroine is a French countess. The story 
of their love affairs is a pretty trifle, well adapted 
to its ornate setting. 

A new edition of Mr. Kenyon Cox's collected 
essays in art criticism, entitled 'Old Masters 
and New,' is published in a handsome volume, 
with one illustration of the work of each painter 
or school discussed, by Messrs. Fox, Duffield & 
Co. Mr. Cox's essays well deserve any added 
advantage that pictures can give them. In these 
days of machine-made criticism his work appeals 
strongly to discriminating readers who can ap- 
preciate the combined authority and charm with 
which he is qualified to speak, and the masterly 
fashion in which, sweeping aside unessential 
matters, he pierces straight to the core of his 
subject, somewhat after the manner of Walter 
Pater. The painters of whom he writes are aU 
peculiarly suited to his somewhat esoteric meth- 
od. In its new dress, therefore, and with its 
score of excellent half-tones, the book should find 
a wider public than ever.

THE DTATi 



[Dec. 16, 



In spite of the very obvious purpose of in- 
troducing dramatic masterpieces to young read- 
ers with which Charles and Mary Lamb wrote 
the ' Tales from Shakespeare, ' some of us still 
cherish our thumbed copies, refusing to yield up 
all rights in them to the younger generation. 
Such persons will appreciate the new edition 
lately imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons,— a beautifully bound and printed quarto 
with colored illustrations by Mr. Norman M. 
Price. Portraits of Charles and Mary Lamb, re- 
drawn in sepia from the originals in the National 
Gallery, stand side by side as the frontispiece. 
Each tale is provided with one illustration, some- 
times rather too highly colored, but always 
imaginative and truly interpretative after a 
fashion that ought to please readers of all ages. 

'Eve's Daughters,' compiled by 'A Mere Man' 
and portrayed by Mr. A. G. Learned, is a very 
miscellaneous collection of epigrams about 
women, published by Messrs, Dana Estes & Co. 
in a volume daintily bound in gold and white and 
lavishly decorated in a humorous style matching 
the gently satiric tone of the text. The quota- 
tions are not grouped in any logical way, and 
the volume belongs to the large class of pretty 
and amusing gift-books which are intended not 
for systematic reading, but for pleasant com- 
panionship in an idle hour. The decorations 
are of indifferent quality, but the epigrams are 
all clever, and the 'Mere Man' has shown a good 
deal of ingenuity in etilling from serious philos- 
ophers and bantering humorists alike something 
that suits his purpose. The numerous quota- 
tions from French authors give the tone to the 
collection. 

The new Scribner edition of Stevenson's 
'Child's Garden of Verses' with illustrations by 
Miss Jessie Willcox Smith, is meant, no doubt, 
for the children, but it is so pretty that older 
readers will be inclined to dispute their exclusive 
right to it. The book is of quarto size, with a, 
glimpse of a garden on the cover, and a design 
made up from garden scenes on the end-papers. 
The colored title page is particularly dainty, with 
its stalks of tall yellow hollyhocks. Each verse has 
an illustrative heading or tail-piece, conceived in 
the quaint spirit of the text. Besides these black- 
and-white drawings, there are a dozen full-page 
plates in colors, picturing with much charm and 
suggestiveness certain favorite bits of Steven- 
son's verse. 

A pretty idyl entitled 'Back to Arcady' (Tur- 
ner) comes from the pen of Mr. Frank Waller 
Allen. It is a tender, graceful little love-story, 
quaintly told by a third person— a charming old 
man. He mingles memories of his own long- 
buried romance, garden thoughts, and out-door 
fancies, with his account of the new romance 
that is growing up between his beautiful young 
ward and his talented young protege. The course 
of true love does not run quite smoothly for a 
time, but in the end it comes out as is to be 
expected of love in Arcady. The illustrations are 
sepia reproductions of dainty pen-and-ink draw- 
ings. Figured end-papers and border designs; on 



alternate pages give the volume a pleasing holiday 
appearance. 

'The Spalding Year Book,' compiled by Miss 
Minnie R. Cowan, is a selection, from the writ- 
ings of Bishop Spalding, of brief quotations for 
every day in the year. The volume is pub- 
lished in Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.'s 'Helpful 
Thoughts Series.' It is tastefully bound in red 
cloth, with a portrait frontispiece, and makes a 
pretty and an inspiring gift-book.— Another very 
attractive year-book from the same publishers is 
a new series of ' Catch Words of Cheer, ' compiled 
by Mrs. Sara A. Hubbard. A quotation attrib- 
uted to Stevenson, 'Man does not live by bread 
alone, but also by catch words,' is set on the 
title-page, and aptly typifies the character of 
the book, which is an excellent combination of 
high seriousness and enlivening humor. There 
are border decorations for every page, and the 
binding is unique and pretty. 

'Old Fashioned Flowers' is the title essay in 
a delightful little volume of nature sketches by 
Maurice Maeterlinck. Half a dozen studies of 
flowers in colors by Mr. Charles B. Falls, and 
attractive type, paper, and binding lend to the 
small volume an air of distinction which matches 
the unusual quality of M. Maeterlinck's style. 
Flowers, like animals, have distinct perspnalities 
for M. Maeterlinck, but his frequent personifica- 
tions are aesthetically justified by the real feeling 
that they express. The essays have already 
appeared in various magazines, but discriminating 
lovers of flowers will like to have them brought 
together in this pretty booklet. (Dodd, Mead 
& Co.) 

'The Heart of Lady Anne' is the title of a 
new novel by Agnes and Egerton Castle, which 
the Frederick A. Stokes Co. publish in a prettily 
illustrated edition. The incomparable Kitty of 
'The Bath Comedy' figures again in this story 
of married love, whose hero and heroine are a 
chivalrous but iron-willed English squire and his 
girl-wife, half French in blood and all French 
by training. Miss Ethel Franklin Betts has 
painted the lovers, catching the spirit both of the 
times and of the story in her pictures; and Mr. 
Frederick G. Hall has provided decorations in 
color which lend an air of festivity to this dainty 
bit of eighteenth century romancing. 

Two holiday issues from the Messrs. Appleton 
show excellent mechanical features and may be 
read with pleasure, — though they fall short of 
the ideal illustrated edition, chiefly because of the 
inherent difficulty presented by their material. 
Sir Gilbert Parker's 'Seats of the Mighty' is too 
large and dramatic a panorama to be susceptible 
of the ordinary sort of illustration. The eight 
tinted pictures, which, with decorated end-papers 
and ornate binding, make up the holiday features 
of the present edition, represent as many dra- 
matic moments in the story. But the artist 's con- 
ception of the situation is ineffective compared 
with the author's, and his figures are very wooden, 
so that the pictures add little, if anything, to the 
reader's pleasure. A similar criticism must be 
passed upon the illustrations for Mr. Kipling's 



1905.] 



THE DTATi

'The Seven Seas.' Mr. Kipling's verse at its best 
is so gfraphie that a fairly good illustration seems 
by comparison unbearably conmionplace. The 
present drawings, while varying greatly in merit, 
never reach anywhere near to the imaginative, 
mystical depths of the verse. The colored page- 
borders, however, furnish suggestive and suitable 
frames for the text, and the cover design is good. 
Xo stories are more appropriate or more popular 
for holiday reprints than Dickens's * Christmas 
Books,' as a coimtless variety of editions attests. 
But more than passing interest attaches to the 
new Dent-Dutton edition of three of the stories, 
published with illustrations in black-and-white 
and in color by Mr. C. E. Brock.* Tbis artist 
touches nothing that he does not adorn,— chiefly, 
no doubt, because he knows his sphere so well. 
Dickens's work comes well within it, and Mr. 
Brock's pictorial interpretations of 'The Chimes,' 
'A Christmas Carol,' and 'The Cricket on the 
Hearth' are thoroughly delightful. There are 
seven colored plates and a few more small pen- 
and-ink drawings in each of the three volumes. 

One of the most artistic of the season's less 
pretentious holiday publications is Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co.'s edition of Tennyson's 'Maud,' 
with illustrations by Miss Helen Maitland Arm- 
strong and conventional floral page-borders, a 
series of very original and suggestive symbolic 
headings for the twenty-eight parts of the poem, 
and a beautiful cover design by Miss Margaret 
Armstrong. The page illustrations, which are 
printed in soft colors on tinted paper, catch the 
over-refined, mystical note of the text perfectly, 
and the book as a whole is a harmonious and 
beautiful production. 

The charming 'Miss Cherry Blossom of Tokio' 
appears in a gay new dress this year, to tempt 
holiday buyers afresh with her delicious 'pigin' 
English, her light-hearted mirth, and her touch- 
ing devotion. The cover of the new edition is 
of cream buckram, prettily ornamented. The 
border designs are Japanese in effect, and are 
printed in half a dozen different color-combina- 
tions, so that there is plenty of variety. Most 
of the illustrations are from photographs, but a 
few are reproductions of Japanese work. Mr. 
John Luther Long contributes a new preface, in 
which he and the great god Asamra talk enter- 
tainingly about the trials, responsibilities, and 
little vanities of authors. (Lippincott.) 

A new edition of Dr. Henry van Dyke's 
'Fisherman's Luck,' made from new plates and 
illustrated by Mr. F. Walter Taylor, has been 
issued by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. It 
is quite unnecessary to dilate upon the charm 
of these delightful essays, which have already 
been reprinted a dozen times. In general form 
the new edition follows the standard editions of 
Dr. van Dyke's other books. The pictures, if 
not particularly interpretative, are at least good 
enough to be unobjectionable. 

'The Beatitudes Calendar,' designed by Mr. 
R. Anning Bell, is larger and more elaborately 
ornamented than Mr. Alfred Bartlett's calendars 



are wont to be. Five sheets, printed in black 
and white, each contain a pictorial treatment of 
one of the beatitudes, with border designs for 
picture and calendar. The effect suggests the old 
wood-cuts, in its boldness and simplicity of 
design; and it is doubtful if anything more 
artistic may be found among the season's calen- 
dars. 

A very appropriate Christmas remembrance 
for a friend is the little booklet by Dr. 
Henry van Dyke, entitled 'The Spirit of 
Christmas' (Scribner). It is daintily bound 
and well printed, with a photogravure frontis- 
piece by way of ornament. It contains a 
'Dream Story,' a Christmas essay, a Cbristmas 
sermon (very short), and two beautiful Christ- 
mas prayers, one for the home and one 'for 
lonely folk.' 

*A Chronicle of Christmas' is the title of a 
bookful of Christmas misceUany, written or 
selected by Miss Jeannette Grace Watson. There 
are Christmas hymns and poems, Christmas 
stories, and brief accounts of Christmas customs 
in many lands. There is even a recipe for the 
Christmas plum pudding. Floral borders and a 
holly-wreathed cover make appropriate decora- 
tions. (Saalfield Publishing Co.)

Miss Ellen Glasgow's new novel, 'The Wheel 
of Life,' will be published early in January by 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

A revised edition of Professor Charles F. Rich- 
ardson's pleasant papers on 'The Choice of 
Books' is published by the Messrs. Putnam. 
There is a lengthy appendix of 'Suggestions for 
Household Libraries.' 

'Salvo Venetia,' Mr. F. Marion Crawford's 
long-promised book on Venice, will appear at once, 
with the Macmillan imprint, in two volumes, illus- 
trated with thirty photogravures and two hun- 
dred pictures in the text from drawings by Mr. 
Joseph PenneU. 

A second and revised edition of 'The Oyster,' 
by Professor William K. Brooks, is published at 
the Johns Hopkins Press. The only notabJe addi- 
tion is that of a section upon the peculiar fitness 
of the oyster to become an agent in the propa- 
gation of germ diseases. 

An admirable addition to the admirable series 
of 'English Keadings' published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. gives us the text of three of 'The 
Lincoln and Douglas Debates,' and Lincoln's 
Cooper Institute address, edited by Professor 
Archibald Lewis Bouton. 

A beautifully-printed edition of Dr. Bichard 
Holbrook's translation of 'The Farce of Master

introduction and notes, comes to us from the press 
of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

'Beethoven' and 'Mozart' are two smaU vol- 
umes published by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. Each is 
a selection of brief extracts from the writings of 
the composer to which it is devoted. The utter- 
ances are classified, and their compilation, by Herr 
Friedrich Kerst, has been a labor of both schol- 
arship and love. Thev are translated and intro- 
duced by Mr. H. E. KrehbieL

THE DIALi 



[Dec. 16, 



Three important books to be issued immediately 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are 'American 
Trades Unionism/ a volume of papers by post- 
graduate students of Johns Hopkins University, 
edited by Professors Hollander and Barnett; 
'The Negro and the Nation,' by Mr. George S. 
Merriam, originally published in the Springfield 
'Eepublican'; and 'Nature and Health,' a book 
of popular hygiene by Dr. Edward Curtis of New 
York. 

'A Satire Anthology' (Scribner) is the contri- 
bution made this year by Miss Carolyn Wells to 
holiday literature. Beginning with the ancients 
(Aristophanes, Horace, and Juvenal), who are 
represented for the purpose of completing the record, 
the selections work down to such very modern 
exemplars of the species as Mr. Owen Seaman 
and Mr. Gelett Burgess. Sprinkled through the 
list of authors we note such out-of-the-way names 
as those of Buteboeuf, Abraham 3, Sancta Clara, 
Villon, and Beranger. The collection is, however, 
mainly one of English verse, from the Elizabethans 
on, and may safely be depended upon to provide 
both amusement and instruction. 

A few sets of the publications of the Biblio- 
graphical Society of Chicago, which terminated its 
existence upon the organization of a national so- 
ciety in 1904, may now be ordered from the Sec- 
retary of the Chicago Chapter of the Society. 
These publications, valuable in themselves, are 
indispensable to a complete history of the Biblio- 
graphical Society of America, since the former 
Chicago society was the direct predecessor of the 
national organization. The set includes the three 
annual Yearbooks, containing the proceedings and 
papers of the society for 1900-3; a reprint of Au- 
gustus De Morgan's 'On the Difficulty of Correct 
Description of Books'; and Mr. A. G. S. Joseph- 
son's list of ' Bibliographies of Bibliographies,' 
chronologically arranged, with occasional notes 
and an index. 

A 'Manuscript Edition' of the complete writ- 
ings of Henry David Thoreau, handsomely illus- 
trated with one hundred photogravures from na- 
ture, is announced by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. The edition will consist of twenty vol- 
umes, limited to 600 signed and numbered sets, 
each containing a page of original manuscript. 
The last fourteen volumes will contain Thoreau 's 
Journal, edited by Mr. Bradford Torrey, the lar- 
ger proportion of which is material that has never 
before been published. The illustrations are from 
photographs by Mr. Herbert W. Gleason, who has 
made a careful study of Thoreau 's writings and 
has explored with equal thoroughness the woods 
and fields about Thoreau 's home. The edition is 
printed in the best style of the Eiverside Press, 
and a few sets will be bound in handsome leather 
with water color frontispieces. 

Mr. Alleyne Ireland's important and exhaustive 
'Report on Colonial Administration in the Far 
East' is announced to begin publication shortly, 
with the imprint of Messrs. Small, Maynard & 
Co. The entire report will extend to ten or 
twelve volumes, the first of which is about to 
appear. Mr. Ireland's study of comparative col- 
onization has extended over a period of fifteen 
years, during which time he has visited not only 
the countries included in his forthcoming report, 
but South America, Australia, the West Indies, 
and others as well. His report will treat of 
every form of dependent government now in force 
in any part of the tropical world. It will deal 
not only at length with such questions as Colonial 



Civil Service, Taxation, the Administration of 
Justice, Public Works, Irrigation, Municipal Gov- 
ernment, Labor Supply, Chinese Immigration, Po- 
lice and Prisons, and General Colonial Legisla- 
tion, but will present a detailed account of the 
commerce, trade, shipping, natural resources, and 
climate of each dependency. Statistical and bibli- 
ographical data, as well as the laws now in force 
in regard to contract labor, municipal govern- 
ment, and civil service for each dependency, will 
be given. 

'The Atlantic Monthly' offers a varied and 
interesting programme for the coming year. 
Among the more important features may be noted 
a series of critical essays on the work of prom- 
inent living writers, among others Henrik Ibsen, 
Edith Wharton, and Anatole France; a series of 
articles dealing with the learned professions, writ- 
ten by prominent members of those professions, 
and including a discussion of 'The Ideal Physi- 
cian ' by Dr. William Osier, and of ' The Ideal Min- 
ister ' by Dr. Charles Cuthbert Hall; several au- 
thoritative papers on the theatre by such writers 
as James L. Metcalfe, Eichard Mansfield, and 
John Corbin; articles on important financial and 
social subjects, by prominent writers in those 
fields; some new letters of Charles Lamb, re- 
cently discovered by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt; and the 
usual variety of brilliant literary essays, short 
stories, and poems, for which 'The Atlantic' is 
unsurpassed among current periodicals. 

A few children's books received too late to 
be included in the list of juvenalia printed in 
The Dial's issue of December 1, nevertheless de- 
serve some sort of mention. 'Tales from Dickens', 
issued by Bobbs-Merrill Co. is a volume of brief 
relations of episodes in fifteen of Dickens's novels, 
told by Haliie Erminie Eives in a style that 
children can understand and enjoy. Mr. Reginald 
Birch furnishes some illustrations that appreciably 
soften the conventional caricature of the old- 
time Dickens illustrators Two beautiful impor- 
tations of Messrs. E, P. Dutton & Co. are 'Una 
and the Bed Cross Knight and Other Tales from 
Spenser's Faery Queene,' retold in modem prose 
by Mr. N. G. Eoyde-Smith and beautifully illus- 
trated by Mr. T. N. Eobinson, and an illustrated 
'Robinson Crusoe' with pictures in line and color 
by Mr. J. Ayton Symington. While the books 
are similar in general style of make-up, they 
differ greatly in artistic merit. The former is 
well written, and illustrated in an imaginative 
style that will interest old and young readers 
equally. The latter, while its illustrations are 
very perfunctory, is an attractive reprint in other 
respects, and boys will enjoy re-reading their old 
favorite in its new dress. — ' The Story of the 
Three Dolls' (Bobbs-Merrill Co.) is written by Jose- 
phine Scribner Gates for the little readers who have 
liked her other doll stories. Unusually spirited 
illustrations, showing the dolls and the children 
who played with them, have been drawn for the 

book by Miss Virginia Keep A book of modern 

fairy tales written by Miss Irene Maunder and 
called 'The Plain Princess, and Other Stories,' 
comes from the press of Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co. In a preface which he contributes to the 
volume, Mr. Andrew Lang assures timid children 
that there is nothing frightful in this book, and 
he advises little boys who don't care for any 
fairy tales to paint the pictures. It is to be 
hoped that only little boys who can paint ex- 
tremely well will follow this advice, for the pic- 
tures, by M. W. Taylor and M. D. Baxter, are 
much too pretty to be spoiled.
