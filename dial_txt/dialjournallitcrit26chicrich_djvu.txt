D. Appleton & Company's New Books 



PUERTO RICO AND ITS RESOURCES. 

A Book for Travellers, Investors, and Others, containing full 
accounts of Natural Features and Resources, Products, 
People, Opportunities for Business, etc. By FREDERICK 

A. OBER, author of " Camps in the Caribbees," " Crusoe's 
Island," etc. With maps and illustrations. 12mo, Cloth, 
$1.50. 

The aim has been to produce a work that will answer all questions 
likely to arise in connection with the acquisition and occupation of this 
new tropical possession of ours. The book is not a sketch for the casual 
visitor, or impressions of a traveller in search of the picturesque, but 
it is a comprehensive, informing, and interesting account of the people, 
land, and products, with the full explanations of the actual conditions 
and opportunities which are needed by visitors and intending investors. 

CANNON AND CAMERA. 

Sea and Land Battles of the Spanish-American War in Cuba, 
Camp Life, and Return of the Soldiers. Described and 
illustrated by J. C. HEMMENT, War Artist at the Front. 
With over one hundred full-page pictures taken by the 
author, and an index. Large 12rao, Cloth, $2.00. 
"The most interesting book about the war so far is 'Canon and 

Camera.' It is also the best, considered purely as a narrative. Mr. 

Hemment was at the right places at the right times. . . . No series of 

pictures as good as this on the scenes and events of the war has been 

made by any other man." Boston Herald. 

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CIVIL WAR. 

By CHARLES A. DANA. With Portrait. Large 12mo, Cloth, 

Gilt Top, Uncut, $2.00. 

" Out of his rich material Mr. Dana has woven a marvellous narra- 
tive. . . . Written as the book is in Mr. Dana's inimitable English, it is 
worthy to rank with the autobiography of Grant in the list of the really 
great works which will bear down to posterity the true story of the 
great war for freedom and for the Union." Boston Journal. 

THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, 

From the Earliest Historical Time to the Year 1898.

Empire," " The British Empire in the Nineteenth Century," 
"Outlines of the World's History," etc. Uniform with 
"Natural History," "Astronomy," and "The Historical 
Reference Book." Small 8vo, Half Leather, $2.00. 
The thoroughness and compactness of this well-digested and com- 
prehensive work render it invaluable as a convenient book of reference. 
The American edition has brought the history of our own country down 
to the close of the war with Spain. 

THE STORY OF THE RAILROAD. 

By CY WARMAN, author of "The Express Messenger," etc. 
A new volume in the "Story of the West Series," edited by

writes without malice, yet with shrewdness and humor." Westminster

THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS. 

Once more the plaint of the bookseller is 
heard in the land, and one would be indeed 
stony-hearted who could view his condition 
without concern. His occupation is slipping 
from him, through the action of irresistible 
economic laws, and the thoughtless public pays 
little heed to his plight. The great dealers in 
miscellaneous merchandise are slowly but surely 
absorbing the retail trade in books, and, not 
content to supply the customers who can come 
to their vast stores, are reaching out, by adver- 
tisements and other devices, to get possession 
of the customers who have hitherto supported 
the booksellers of the smaller towns. The old- 
fashioned type of bookseller is by way of join- 
ing the dodo and the megathesium, just as the 
old-fashioned college president, and the all- 
around lawyer, and the general medical prac- 
titioner, are passing from the places that soon 
shall know them no more. It is a melancholy 
sight for those who cling to old ways and old 
institutions, but " there is no help for these 
things," as the poet has it, and we must learn 
to adapt ourselves to the new conditions. The 
quiet and venerable scholar who formerly ruled 
over his college as a world apart has given place 
to the energetic young man of business instincts 
and capacity for advertising his institution ; 
the professional man in whose hands you once 
placed your case, whatever it might be, with 
confidence that he would know how to deal with 
it, has given place to the specialist who nine 
times out of ten would n't understand your case 
at all. And, coming to the point of our pres- 
ent theme, the bookseller who used to think fifty 
per cent not too large a profit upon his wares, 
considering that he offered as a bonus his good 
advice and genial friendship, has given place 
to the merchant who can wax fat upon ten per 
cent, or less, of profit, but is too busy to have 
either advice or friendship to spare for you. 

It is evident that the entire business of the 
distribution of books is just now in a transition 
state, and that its immediate condition is dis- 
tressing, or at least has distressing features, to 
the more conservative and thoughtful part of 
the public. We are inclined to believe, as will 
be suggested later on, that this transition state 



6 



THE DIAL, 



[Jan. 1, 



is not altogether unpromising for the future, 
and that the outcome may be of a nature not 
inimical to the best interests of culture. But 
the present condition of affairs is an unques- 
tionable hardship for the bookseller, who is a 
middleman, and who is bound to suffer from 
the , general and undiscriminating onslaught 
upon middlemen which is characteristic of the 
existing economic situation. As the organiza- 
tion of business becomes more and more com- 
plete, it is inevitable that the profits of the 
middleman should be reduced, and the more 
compact social arrangements toward which we 
are tending must mean for the bookseller, as 
for so many others, a sharper struggle for ex- 
istence than he has heretofore been called upon 
to make. 

One of the experiments most ominous to 
the bookseller is that recently made by a pub- 
lishing house which advertises broadcast its 
willingness to send any of its publications to 
any address upon the receipt of a postal card re- 
quest, trusting to the honesty of the prospective 
purchaser either to return the book or to pay 
for it. This plan shows a remarkable confi- 
dence in human nature at least in the human 
nature of the book-buying public and we 
shall be much interested to learn how successful 
it proves. Its general adoption by publishers 
would tend to eliminate retail bookselling from 
the list of business occupations. Still another 
experiment of which the bookseller makes com- 
plaint is that of selling books of the more ex- 
pensive sort upon the instalment plan, the 
entire work being delivered upon receipt of 
the order and the first payment. This method 
of depleting the book-buyer's purse has long 
found favor with the publishers of works sold 
by subscription, and now certain publishers of 
the regular sort seem inclined to see what they 
can do with it. Such experiments as these, and 
others that might be mentioned, are extremely 
interesting to the economist, and both interest- 
ing and enjoyable to those tradesmen who profit 
by them directly, but they are " death to the 
frogs," who may be excused for croaking rather 
more vociferously than usual at the ingenious 
devices of which they are victims. 

Still another onslaught upon the bookseller's 
peace of mind, an onslaught so unexpected and 
so startling that it left him gasping for breath, 
was that made a few months ago by Librarian 
Dewey, who calmly proposed that the public 
libraries throughout the country should become 
book-selling as well as book-circulating agen- 
cies. In other words, he proposed to sweep the 



private bookseller out of existence as completely 
as his namesake swept out of existence the 
Spanish fleet at Manila. Booksellers have 
always looked askance at public libraries, not 
understanding how they create an appetite for 
reading that is sure in the end to redound to 
the bookseller's advantage, but their suspicious 
fears never anticipated the explosion in their 
camp of such a bombshell as this. Fortunately 
for them, the suggestion was not taken very 
seriously by those to whom it was made, its 
flavor of state socialism being too strong for the 
public mind, even in the lax and receptive con- 
dition to which that mind has become reduced 
of recent years. If the state or the municipality 
were to go into the business of selling books at 
cost, what should prevent it from doing the like 
with groceries ? 

All these insidious devices for supplanting the 
bookseller must be met, if they are to be met at 
all, by the more effective organization of his 
trade. The most promising suggestion put for- 
ward in his behalf has been "made in Germany," 
or rather practised there, and explained to En- 
glish readers by Professor J. G. Robertson in 
a recent number of " Literature." " So com- 
plete is the organization," we are informed, 
of the German retail bookselling trade, " that 
a publisher can rely on having whatever special 
treatises he may undertake to publish brought 
directly under the eyes of every scholar in the 
country who is in the least likely to become 
a purchaser, and this without any trouble or 
expense for advertising on his part. Every 
retail bookseller, even in the smallest German 
town, is, thanks to the excellence of the German 
system, in a position to send, and, as a matter 
of course, does send, his customers copies on 
approbation (Exemplare zur Ansicht) of all 
new books in which they are interested." Com- 
pare such a practice with that of the American 
bookseller, whose utmost effort in this direction 
is to send to his customers a classified list of all 
the publications of the month, leaving the cus- 
tomers to hunt out the titles that seem attract- 
ive, and to order the books on the chances of 
their proving satisfactory. If our booksellers 
would cooperate in such fashion as this with our 
publishers, there would be small danger of the 
publishers' resorting to ingenious methods for 
the elimination of the booksellers from the field 
of competition. Or rather, there would no longer 
be any real competition between the two classes, 
but a relation of mutual helpfulness that would 
impel each of them to cherish the interests of 
the other.

We said, early in this discussion, that the 
future of bookselling does not seem to us, on 
the whole, unpromising. Beyond such special 
suggestions, as have already been made and 
that might be made, looking toward an improved 
organization and a closer cooperation, there is 
the broad general fact that the appetite for 
books is constantly growing among our popu- 
lation. The increasing importance of books as 
a part of the household furnishings is a phenom- 
enon that cannot fail to attract the attention of 
all observers. The sort of household that, a 
generation ago, had only a few nondescript vol- 
umes piled away upon the shelf of some closet 
now has a neat and well-filled bookcase. The 
household that then had a few shelves now has 
as many cases. They may be cheap books 
but books they are and the proportion among 
them of really good literature is surprising. 
This seems to be an entirely natural develop- 
ment, and the time is coming when reading- 
matter will be as staple a commodity as gro- 
ceries, and as necessary for the daily needs. 
Nor will these needs be supplied, in the long 
run, by newspapers and magazines, or by the 
providence of the public libraries. These things 
merely create an appetite which nothing but 
books can eventually satisfy. It is folly, then, 
to assume that bookstores will be lacking to 
satisfy this appetite for the possession of liter- 
ature, since the book- buyer, as a rule, wants to 
inspect his books before buying, and the retail 
trade in books is as sure of customers as the 
retail trade in eggs and poultry. That trade, 
we have not the least doubt, will emerge tri- 
umphant from its seeming temporary eclipse, 
but it will be adapted to the new conditions, it 
will be reorganized to meet the new demands, 
and it will be willing to find in its larger sales 
a compensation for its lessened percentage of 
profit. 



EDWARD GAY MASON. 



In the death of Edward Gay Mason, on the 
eighteenth of December, THE DIAL lost a valued 
contributor, and Chicago one of its most distin- 
guished citizens. Men of his type are not common in 
any community, and are rare indeed in such a place 
as Chicago, where the hitherto all-important spirit 
of commercialism is but just beginning to recognize 
the claims of other than business interests upon the 
life of man. It was in this city that Mr. Mason, 
a native of Connecticut, lived for nearly forty of the 
best years of the fifty-nine allotted him. And it is 
this city alone that realizes to the full the loss that 



comes from his untimely taking-off . The outside 
world heard of him from time to time as an eminent 
lawyer, as a member of the governing body of Yale 
University, and as a specialist in American history. 
Chicago knew- him continuously and intimately, as 
the active friend of all worthy enterprises, as an intel- 
lectual force in the society of which he was a part, as 
a good citizen in the highest sense of the term. As 
a leader of the Chicago bar, as a controlling spirit in 
the higher club life of the city, as a brilliant public 
speaker upon occasions both formal and informal, 
his memory will fade as those who knew him in these 
activities pass from the stage. But one monument, 
at least, remains to keep his memory green and 
that is the impressive building of the Chicago Histori- 
cal Society, which, with its rich collection of books 
and manuscripts, of portraits and autographs, relat- 
ing to the early Northwest, is a memorial of his zeal 
as a collector, his enthusiasm as a student, and his 
power to enlist the aid of his fellows in giving per- 
manent embodiment to a fine conception. He was by 
no means the only man deserving of remembrance in 
this connection, but for a score of years past his was 
the leading spirit in the common endeavor of the 
members of the Society to bring together for future 
historians the mass of material now contained within 
the fine structure in Dearborn Avenue. Since the 
Society had, upon two occasions in its earlier days, 
lost all of its collections by fire, he was determined 
to make a third disaster of the sort impossible, and 
it was due to his insistence upon Ibis point that the 
permanent home of the organization is a building 
into whose construction nothing combustible enters, 
a building fireproof in the literal sense of the word. 
As a writer, Mr. Mason never found time to do the 
work that it was in him to perform. His publica- 
tions take the fugitive form of such papers and 
pamphlets as " The March of the Spaniards across 
Illinois," "Old Fort Chartres," "Illinois in the 
Eighteenth Century," " Kaskaskia and its Parish 
Records," and many other titles. Some years ago 
he was commissioned by Messrs. Houghton, Miffiin 
& Co. to write the history of " Illinois " for the 
" American Commonwealths " series, and accepted 
the task. No man was better equipped for this work, 
and it is cause for deep regret that he should not have 
lived to complete it. A portion of the manuscript 
exists, and it is possible that the work is sufficiently 
advanced to make its completion by another hand 
a work of no great difficulty. If this be the case, 
no time should be lost in carrying out the plan, and 
in utilizing whatever it still be possible to utilize of 
the material collected by him. If, more particularly, 
the portion of the work substantially completed 
covers the early period of Illinois history, with which 
no other man was so competent to deal, it should 
not be a matter of great difficulty to supply chapters 
upon the later period, and thus bring the work down 
to our own times. The performance of this task 
would be the best possible service to his memory, 
besides making an important contribution to Amer- 
ican historical literature.

Ho, the White Pinnace! the Foam- white Pinnace! 

Blithe and free as the seagull's wing! 
A-leap to discover the dim seas over 

Lovelier lands than the poets sing. 

Ho, the White Pinnace! the Joy-bright Pinnace! 

The blue wave creams at her eager blow. 
'T is well with the sail that hears her hail, 

And sees her pass like a flight of snow. 

Ho, the White Pinnace! the Dove- white Pinnace! 

Tender for rock and fragile for gale! 
Her Indies rise where to mortal eyes 

Is only the mid-sea moonshine pale. 

Ah, the White Pinnace! the Moon-light Pinnace! 

Trembling from view in that strange white fire! 
Yet mariners know, where God's tides flow, 

And only there, lies Port Desire.

THE PROPOSED GOETHE MONUMENT IN 

STRASSBURG. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

The year 1899 brings with it the 150th anniversary 
of Goethe's birth. An influential German committee, 
under the protectorate of the Grand Duke Carl Alex- 
ander of Weimar, has invited not only the inhabitants 
of Alsace, German students, and patriotic Germans in 
general, but also people of culture everywhere who 
acknowledge a debt to the great author, to lend their 
aid toward erecting a statue of " the young Goethe " in 
Strassburg. The project is progressing steadily, and 
already more than 12,000 marks have been subscribed 
in Germany. 

Many Americans recall with great pleasure the very 
active interest and participation shown by a number of 
the most influential professors and scholars of Berlin last 
year at the time when our students instituted a celebra- 
tion of Lowell's birthday, an interest which carried the 
project to a distinct success which it could not have hoped 
for otherwise. Doubtless many who have responded to 
the idyllic charm of Goethe's imperishable Sesenheim 
idyl, who recall that " Goetz " and " Faust " were planned 
while the poet was a student at Strassburg, and who have 
had pleasure in his delightful descriptions of that city 
and Alsace, will be glad to add some share to the noble 
and substantial tribute which is to be erected. To give 
Americans this opportunity, an American committee has 
been named, to assist in making the plan known, and to 
receive any contributions, however small, which are in- 
spired by the idea. The committee consists of Professor 
Kuno Francke of Harvard University, Professor Horatio 
S. White of Cornell University, and the undersigned. 
Contributions can be sent directly to any member of the 
committee, or to Messrs. Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., 
bankers, 46 Wall Street, New York City.

Evanston, Illinois, Dec. 24, 1898. 



A STATESMAN'S RETROSPECT.* 

Bismarck's autobiography, at last before us, 
is a better book than Dr. Busch's discouraging 
forecast led us to expect. Doubtless Busch 
foresaw in it, or fancied that he foresaw, a 
dangerous rival of his own performance ; and, 
not being bred in a school of over-scrupulosity, 
he did not hesitate to brand by innuendo the 
impending competitor in advance as a dull 
book. He might have spared himself the 
trouble. The work is of a quite different cast 
and genre from his own racy and scandal- 
mongering volumes, and so is not likely to enter 
into, or at least to remain long in, competition 
with them. One cannot imagine Dr. Johnson 
writing an autobiography, however good, that 
would have supplanted Boswell's book ; and 
what Boswell did for the lexicographer, Busch 
has done, in a comparatively limited way of 
course, for the great Chancellor. Bismarck's 
book is essentially one for the student of po- 
litical history, who wants clews and explana- 
tions, and cares little for the lighter matters of 
personality and anecdote. It is a complete key 
to the Bismarckian system of politics (it a 
scheme so tempered or alloyed with opportun- 
ism can properly be called a system), as car- 
ried into practice during the period of its hold- 
er's ascendency in Prussian counsels. There 
need in the future be no debate as to why the 
masterful Chancellor acted so or so in this or 
that important political juncture. Such doubts 
are now solved for us in the most authoritative 
way. Of narrative proper the autobiography 
contains but little. It presupposes in the reader 
a competent knowledge of the events of which 
it supplies, in so far as the author's own share 
in them went, the rationale. Those who look 
to it mainly for the spectacle of a discarded 
and embittered statesman indulging his turn 
for satire at the expense of his whilom foes 
will be disappointed. Compared with Busch's 
examples of the Chancellor's ordinary manner 
of speech, these two volumes seem even elabo- 
rately circumspect in phrase and temperate in 
judgment. What the deferred third and con- 
cluding volume, in which the present Emperor 
is to be brought upon the scene, may develop,

we can only conjecture. But in the present 
instalment of the memoirs there seems to be 
little that " Herr Lehmann " himself, the 
touchiest of created mortals (if one may ven- 
ture to call Him mortal) can take umbrage at 
which must be a comfort to the judicious 
editor, Herr Kohl. 

In his youth Bismarck did not altogether 
escape the liberal contagion, then in the air, 
and he had brought away with him from the 
preparatory school, which was conducted on 
Jahn's principles, certain German-National im- 
pressions on which, he says, " I lived from my 
sixth to my twelfth year." These impressions 
remained in the stage of theoretical reflections, 
his historical and innate sympathies leaning 
to the side of authority as embodied in the 
Prussian monarchy. Nevertheless, on entering 
the University, he joined a students' corps 
whose watchword was German nationalism. 
Mingled with the Germanism of these young 
men, however, were certain social and political 
extravagances not so much to the taste of the 
well-born Prussian Junker, on whose nerves, 
too, the under-bred ways of his democratically 
minded associates grated. Their ideas gave 
him a lasting impression of an " association 
between Utopian theories and defective breed- 
ing." But he managed to retain a sound leaven 
of practical National sentiment, and a belief 
that events would lead in the not remote future 
to German unity. " I made," he says, " a bet 
with my American friend Coffin that this aim 
would be attained in twenty years." Bismarck's 
always modest stock of liberalism was percep- 
tibly lessened by the Frankfort riot of 1833, 
and dwindled to a for the time quite negligible 
quantity when the tocsin of actual revolution 
affrighted Berlin in the March days of 1848. 
The Prussian capital, which once cowered under 
the rattan stick of a decrepit and half-crazy 
tyrant, now fairly took the bit in its teeth, and 
seemed, while the fit was on, not unlikely to 
furnish a clumsy German analogue of the Paris 
drama of '89. The part enacted by Bismarck 
in that momentous year is well known. The 
course he favored as against the riotous Ber- 
liners is well indicated in the marginal note 
made by the King against his name in a list of 
suggested Councillors : " Only to be employed 
when the bayonet governs unrestricted." A 
conversation Bismarck had with the King in 
June at Sans-Souci is worth recording : 

" After dinner the King took me onto the terrace, 
and asked me in a friendly way : ' How are you getting 
on? ' In the irritable state I had been in ever since 



the March days, I replied: 'Badly.' The King said: 
' I think the feeling is good in your parts.' Thereupon, 
under the impression made by some regulations, the 
contents of which I do not remember, I replied : ' The 
feeling was very good, but since we have been inocu- 
lated with the revolution by the King's officials under 
the royal sign-manual, it has become bad. What we 
lack is confidence in the support of the King.' At that 
moment the Queen stepped out from the shrubbery and 
said: ' How can you speak so to the King.' 'Let me 
alone, Elise,' replied the King, ' I shall soon settle his 
business'; and turning to me, he said: 'What do you 
really reproach me with, then? ' ' The evacuation of 
Berlin.' 'I did not want it done,' replied the King; 
and the Queen, who had remained within hearing, added: 
' Of that the King is quite innocent. He had not slept 
for three days.' A King ought to be able to sleep,' I 
replied. Unmoved by this blunt remark, the King said: 
' It is always easier to prophesy when you know. What 
would be gained if I admitted that I had behaved like 
a donkey? Something more than reproaches is needed 
to set an overturned throne up again. To do that I 
need assistance and active devotion, not criticism? ' The 
kindness with which he said all this, and more to the 
same effect, overpowered me. I had come in the spirit 
of afrondeur, who would not have cared if he had been 
dismissed ungraciously; I went away completely dis- 
armed and won over." 

In his interesting chapter setting forth the 
opinions he held and the course he advocated 
as to the conduct of the siege of Paris, Bis- 
marck states that in the Council of War Roon 
was the only supporter of his view that the sur- 
render of the city should be forced at once by 
a bombardment. The slower " method of fam- 
ine " (as being the " humaner " one) found 
powerful support " in the circles where exalted 
ladies met," and where " philanthropic hypoc- 
risy," harping on the "English catchwords 
' Humanity and Civilization,' " held sway. The 
intervention of neutrals, taking the form of a 
congress which in the name of justice and mod- 
eration should rob Germany of the substantial 
fruits of victory, was what Bismarck dreaded. 
He accordingly reversed his moderate counsels 
of 1866, and pressed for vigorous action. His 
opinion, backed by Roon, prevailed ; and with 
the bombardment of Mont Avron came the be- 
ginning of the end. Bismarck's reflections on 
these matters are characteristic : 

"In setting one's-self the question as to what can 
have induced other generals to oppose Roon's view, it 
is difficult to discover any technical reasons for the de- 
lay in the measures taken towards the close of the 
year. . . . The notion that Paris, although fortified and 
the strongest bulwark of our opponents, might not be 
attacked in the same way as any other fortress had been 
imported into our camp from England by the roundabout 
route of Berlin, together with the phrase about the 
' Mecca of civilization,' and other expressions of human- 
itarian feeling rife and effective in the cant of English 
public opinion a feeling which England expects other 
Powers to respect, though she does not always allow

her opponents to have the benefit of it. It was from 
London that representations were received in our most 
influential circles that the capitulation of Paris ought 
not to be brought about by bombardment, but only by 
hunger. . . . Trustworthy information from Berlin ap- 
prised me that the cessation of our activity gave rise to 
anxiety and dissatisfaction in expert circles, and that 
Queen Augusta was said to be influencing her royal hus- 
band by letters, in the interests of humanity. An allu- 
sion to information of this kind which I made to the 
King occasioned a violent outburst of anger, not to the 
effect that the rumors were untrue, but in a sharp rep- 
rimand against the utterance of any such dissatisfaction 
respecting the Queen." 

Discussing universal suffrage Bismarck avers 
the principle to be a just one, not only in theory 
but also in practice, " provided always that vot- 
ing be not secret, for secresy is a quality incom- 
patible with the best characteristics of German 
blood ": 

" The influences and the dependence on others that the 
practical life of man brings in its train are God-given re- 
alities which we cannot and must not ignore. If we refuse 
to transfer them to political life, and base the public life 
of the country on the belief in the secret insight of all, 
we fall into a contradiction between public law and the 
realities of human life which practically leads to constant 
frictions, and finally to an explosion, and to which there 
is no theoretical solution except in the way of the insani- 
ties of social-democracy, the support given to which rests 
on the fact that the judgment of the masses is sufficiently 
stultified and undeveloped to allow them, with the assist- 
ance of their own greed, to be continually caught by the 
rhetoric of clever and ambitious leaders. ... A state, 
the control of which lies in the hands of the greedy, of the 
novarum rerum cupidi, and of orators who have the capac- 
ity for deceiving the unreasoning masses in a higher 
degree than others, will constantly be doomed to a rest- 
lessness of development, which so ponderous a mass as 
the commonwealth of the state cannot follow with injury 
to its organism." 

The Chancellor's satiric turn peeps out occa- 
sionally, as in his references to Gortchakoff : 

" His subordinates in the ministry said of Gortchakoff: 
< II se mire dans son encrier,' just as Bettina used to say 
of her brother-in-law, Savigny, He cannot cross a gutter 
without looking at himself in it.' . . . When he dictated 
he used to take a regular pose, which he introduced with 
the word ' ecrivez '! and if the secretary thoroughly ap- 
preciated his position he turned at particularly well- 
rounded phrases an admiring glance on his chief, who 
was very sensible to it." 

When Gortchakoff accepted the presidency 
of the diplomatic conference at Berlin in May, 
1876, Bismarck relates that during the delivery 
of the presidential address *' I wrote in pencil : 
' Pompous, pompo, pomp, pom, po.' My 
neighbor, Lord Odo Russell, snatched the paper 
from me and kept it." 

A striking anecdote is told of Emperor 
Nicholas of Russia. Bismarck had it from 
Frederick William IV.: 

" The Emperor Nicholas asked him to send two cor- 



porals of the Prussian guard for the purpose of per- 
forming a certain massage treatment prescribed by the 
doctors, which was to be carried out on the back of the 
patient while he lay on his stomach. He added: I can 
always manage my Russians when I can look them in 
the face, but on my back and without eyes, I should not 
like them to come near me.' The corporals were sent 
confidentially, and were employed and handsomely paid. 
This shows how, in spite of the religious devotion of the 
Russian people to their Czar, the Emperor Nicholas did 
not absolutely trust his personal safety in a tete-a-tete 
even to the ordinary man among his subjects; and it is 
a sign of great strength of character that up to the end 
of his life he did not allow himself to be depressed by 
these feelings." 

The impression of Bismarck that one gathers 
from these volumes quite bears out the Gladston- 
ian verdict : " A big man, but very unscrupu- 
lous." They fail to disclose, so far as we can dis- 
cern, a single distinctive humane, amiable trait 
on the part of their author. It was in his time, 
and apparently still is, to the advantage of 
Prussia that the guidance of her affairs fell into 
the powerful hands of this Colossus. So far 
she has been a great gainer, in prestige at least ; 
and in this gain the Empire has shared. But 
there are nevertheless those who maintain that 
the cynically confessed unscrupulosity with 
which the Chancellor sought and gained his 
ends will bear its natural fruit in the fulness 
of time ; and that as those who live by the sword 
shall perish by the sword, so a political struc- 
ture welded through " blood and iron " is shad- 
owed by no uncertain Nemesis. The powerful 
bond of the common danger that lowers over 
Germany from the North and the South once 
removed, the formal federal tie may prove to 
be a rope of sand. Dynastic jealousies, reli- 
gious differences, inbred sectional patriotisms 
far more intense and deeply rooted than the 
State sentiment that once threatened to wreck 
our own Federal Union, are centrifugal forces 
constantly tending to drag the still sovereign 
German states from their new orbit ; and that 
the spectre of " Particularism " will not down 
was forcibly shown only the other day by the 
petty but significant Lippe-Detmold incident. 
The smallest German house refuses to be dra- 
gooned in respect of its own local and dynastic 
concerns by the Emperor ; and the larger ones, 
glad of an opportunity to indirectly assert their 
own dignities, ostentatiously support the recal- 
citrant, to the infinite chagrin of the Hallowed 
Person at Berlin. 

We cannot unreservedly praise the present 
translation of this important work, nor can we 
accept as a sufficient excuse for its imperfec- 
tions the English editor's statement that the

tory, though we notice a few misprints, notably 
an absurd one (" Ylarr " for Year) in the Table 
of Contents of the opening volume. There are 
a brace of fine portraits of the Chancellor, and 
a specimen leaf of his handwriting.

SOME RECENT ILLUSTRATIONS OF 
SHAKESPEARE.* 



In his introduction to the last book on our 
present list, Dr. Rolfe expresses the opinion 
that most intelligent people are acquainted with 
Shakespeare chiefly through the half-dozen 
plays that are commonly put upon the stage. 
This view has been often expressed, notably 
by Robert Browning in one of his epilogues : 

" For see your cellarage ! 

There are forty barrels with Shakespeare's brand. 
Some five or six are abroach : the rest 
Stand spigoted, fauceted. Try and test 
What yourselves call of the very best ! 

How comes it that still untouched they stand ? 
Why don't you try tap, advance a stage 
With the rest in cellarage ? " 

It was in 1876 that this taunt, which then had, 
doubtless, the sting of truth, was flung at the 
British public. Since then, what battalions 
of annotated editions of the plays, bristling with 
scholastic weapons, have been thrown forward 
in support of the supremacy of Shakespeare ! 

" Advanced in view they stand a horrid front 
Of dreadful length " 

Truly " the kingdom of heaven suffereth vio- 
lence "; and there is a certain mournful justice 
in the circumstance that one of the most promi- 
nent leaders in this attempt to force special 
scholarship upon a bewildered public should 
now admit by implication the defeat of the 
enterprise. I would not be understood as dis- 
paraging the labors of so excellent a Shake- 
pearian as Dr. Rolfe. It is a question not of 
a man but of a system. When such a man as Dr.

Rolfe avers that the majority of cultivated 
people who fancy they know Shakespeare well 
"have only a smattering of this education," 
we understand what the standard of judgment 
is. Few persons, indeed, are in readiness to sub- 
mit to an English civil-service examination in 
Shakespeare, or, what amounts to the same 
thing, to such a test as Dr. Rolfe would impose. 
It is likewise probable that few intelligent 
Greeks of the time of Pericles could have passed 
such an examination in Homer as a modern pro- 
fessor would exact. 

But unless some signs fail, popular interest in 
Shakespeare is steadily widening, and with that 
interest Shakespeare scholarship itself is sus- 
taining a healthy growth. Of the many signs 
that Shakespeare appeals now to the popular 
mind and heart more widely than ever before, 
I instance only the immediate and enormous 
success of the beautiful " Temple Edition." 
Attractive to the eye, seductive to the touch, 
provided with all necessary and no superfluous 
apparatus, this edition captivates learned and 
unlearned alike. It has been argued plausibly, 
but, I think, paradoxically, that the success 
is due to the outward form of these dainty little 
volumes. Any well-bound edition in tall vol- 
umes makes, however, a greater show in the 
library. The " Temple Edition," being handy 
to carry to the fireside, to the brookside, or to 
bed, appeals to the appetite of the actual reader. 

Of the spread of Shakespeare scholarship, 
in the best sense, the progress of the magnum 
opus of Dr. Furness is a cheering sign. That 
the " New Variorum Shakespeare " is one of the 
signal monuments of American scholarship was 
long ago agreed by those qualified to judge, 
at home and abroad. In relation to the plays 
whereof they treat, these noble volumes are 
a veritable library, " The best that has been 
thought and said in the world " on these sub- 
jects. A brief recapitulation of the history of 
this great work may be of interest. The ten 
plays thus far edited, with the dates of publica- 
tion, are as follows : Romeo and Juliet (1871), 
Macbeth (1873), Hamlet (2 vols., 1877), King 
Lear (1880), Othello (1886), The Merchant 
of Venice (1888), As You Like It (1890), 
The Tempest (1892), A Midsummer Night's 
Dream (1895), The Winter's Tale (1898). 
It will be noticed that, except in the cases 
of Hamlet and Othello, these editions have 
followed one another quite regularly at inter- 
vals of two or three years. In the cases of the 
first four plays, Dr. Furness followed the tra- 
ditional practice of editors in presenting us with 



12 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



a text of his own. Beginning with Othello, he 
introduced a notable innovation, from which he 
has not since seen reason to swerve. This inno- 
vation consisted in the reprint, line for line, 
word for word, letter for letter, point for point, 
error for error, of the text of the First Folio, 
with all its imperfections on its head. The inno- 
vation had the boldness as well as the simplicity 
of genius, and has amply justified itself. It is 
not too much to say that this is one of the most 
valuable features of the great work, although 
the earlier volumes, which lacked this feature, 
were sufficient to win for the author recognition 
as one of the first Shakespearians of the world. 
In an edition which gives on every page a con- 
spectus of all the variant readings, and which 
is intended solely for the student, there is indeed 
no reason why an original text should not be lit- 
erally reprinted. Yet such is the force of custom 
and opinion that it was only after he had spent 
years upon the work and had completed the 
edition of four of the most important plays, that 
Dr. Furness came to see what now, partly by 
virtue of his example, seems so obvious. 

This edition of the Winter's Tale contains 
then, first, a minutely accurate reprint of the text 
of the First Folio (1623), in the case of this 
play, the earliest known text. Fortunately, in 
spite of the compression of the style, frequently 
amounting to crabbeduess, the text is unusually 
accurate, presenting almost none of the cruces 
which are the despair of the reader and the 
opportunity of the commentator. The commen- 
tators have, however, not allowed themselves 
to be discouraged by so small a circumstance ; 
Dr. Furness's citations from them indicate that 
they have been as busy over this play as over 
some of those whose texts are less pure. The 
most apposite comments of all the editors are 
cited in chronological order, the banquet being 
frequently sauced with excellent foolery which is 
none the less entertaining for being so seriously 
meant. Over all, Dr. Furness presides with wis- 
dom, moderation, and an unfailing good-temper, 
which contrasts wholesomely with the " savage 
and tartar ly" tone of some of the eighteenth- 
century editors, while not excluding a vein of 
delightful irony. A marked feature of the en- 
tire work, from first to last, is the growing con- 
fidence of the modest editor in his own judgment. 
In the later volumes he more frequently cuts 
short the droning commentators and gives us of 
his own, but never a word too much. Surely 
Dr. Furness is the most genial of editors ; and 
I think it not too much to add that he is for the 
most part the most convincing. Unlike Homer, 



he never nods ; at least, after communing with 
him for several years I have never caught him 
napping. His fault is of an opposite character, 
and might be said to be a fault that leans to 
virtue's side: namely, supersubtlety. The acute- 
ness that renders him formidable in detecting 
the fallacies of other commentators sometimes 
makes him over-ingenious in his own interpre- 
tations. It is the defect of his quality. Inas- 
much as his criticism of his venerated author 
is habitually constructive, this subtlety spends 
itself in the discovery of possible meanings, and 
is never seriously misleading. 

In many cases in which the commentators 
with their darkness do affront Shakespeare's 
light, Dr. Furness scatters the fog in a masterly 
way. Take for example the passage from Her- 
mione's last speech at the trial, thought by 
Hudson to be " the solidest piece of eloquence 
in the language ": * 

"Now (my Liege) 

Tell me what blessings I have here alive 
That I should feare to die ? Therefore proceed : 
But yet heare this : mistake me not : no Life, 
( I prize it not a straw ) but for mine Honor, 
Which I would free : if I shall be condemn'd 
Upon surmizes (all proof es sleeping else, 
But what your Jealousies awake) I tell you 
'Tis Rigor, and not Law." (III., ii., 113.) 

The commentators all stick upon the exclama- 
tion " no Life ": some of them scent a misprint. 
White and Hudson read " my life "; Dyce and 
Rolfe, " for life." Whereupon Dr. Furness : 

" I cannot but believe that this phrase has been mis- 
understood. With line 115, Hermione ends her defence, 
by commanding the trial to proceed. Then the thought 
of a sullied name flashes upon her, and that she has not 
with sufficient emphasis contended for the preservation 
of her honour; she hastily resumes, but fearing lest the 
king should misinterpret, and suppose that it is to plead 
for life, and not for what was, for her boy's sake, 
infinitely dearer to her, she exclaims: 'Mistake me 
not ! No life ! Give me not that ! I prize it not a straw ! ' 
It is really the climax of the speech. Self-commiseration 
has vanished, and she speaks for her honour with the last 
fire of her exhausted strength. The lines from ' mistake 
me not ' to ' I would free,' inclusive, are parenthetical. 
'Tis rigor and not law!' the last words she ever ad- 
dresses throughout the play to her husband, are full 
of the sternness of Fate, and mean, of course, that her 
honour will remain unblemished." 

Mr. Justice Madden's " Study of Shake- 
speare and of Elizabethan Sport " may be pro- 
nounced a fair model of what such a book 
should be. It is exact without being pedantic 
and systematic without being tedious, bearing 
evidence on every page that Ingram and Dow- 
den are not, in our time, the only representa- 
tives of Shakespeare scholarship connected with

THE DIAL

the University of Dublin. Through the whole 
runs an agreeable vein of fiction based upon 
the fragment of a diary supposed to have been 
written by William Silence, which contains 
allusions to the presence at Shallow (Chatel- 
hault) Hall in Gloucestershire of another Will- 
iam, a quiet observant young gentleman from 
Stratford on Avon (See the Second Part of 
Henry IV., Act III., Scene ii.). Not the 
least interesting feature of the book is the by 
no means baseless suggestion that, at one time 
or another, Shakespeare spent a good deal of 
time in Gloucestershire ; that he there partici- 
pated in the field sports of country gentlemen 
and yeomen ; and that in this particular way 
he picked up his astonishing knowledge of all 
matters connected with falconry, horseman- 
ship, and the chase. The author maintains 
that Shakespeare's allusions to these matters 
differ from those of all other writers, ancient 
and modern, both in number and, on the whole, 
in quality. True, there are hundreds of such 
allusions which appear in themselves of an or- 
dinary kind, but even these acquire significance 
" from the circumstance that they are seldom 
suggested by any necessary action of the drama, 
but seem to spring forth out of the abundance 
of the poet's heart." Those which are more 
distinctly Shakespearian are divided into five 
classes, accordingly as they embody " 1, a 
secret of woodcraft or horsemanship ; 2, an 
illustration therefrom of human nature and 
conduct; 3, a lively image ; 4, a conceit ; or, 5, 
an irrelevance ; by which I mean an idea some- 
what out of place with its surroundings " 
(p. 313). The accumulation of illustrations 
of all these classes of allusions, and the very 
great clearing up of obscurities which results 
from their systematic treatment by an expert 
in field sports, give -very high and doubtless 
permanent value to the book. In the follow- 
ing metaphor of Hermione, for example, he 
finds a secret both of horsemanship and of 
human conduct: 

" You may ride 's 

With one soft kisse a thousand Furlongs, ere 
With Spur we heat an Acre." (I., ii., 117). 

It is interesting that both Madden and Furness 
accept without question the reading of the 
Folio, although Furness quotes without com- 
ment from Capell the statement that the phrase 
"heat an acre" has not been traced. Is it pos- 
sible that the French parallel, bruler le pave, 
has never been suggested by any commentator ? 
Had the Diary of Master Silence been given 
to the world a little earlier, Dr. Furness might 



have found his account in it for his edition of 
the Winter's Tale. Referring to Leontes's 
" note infallible of breaking honesty " 

" Stopping the Cariere 
Of Laughter, with a sigh." (I., ii., 332), 

Dr. Furness annotates merely as follows : 

" Cariere, A term of horsemanship, meaning a 
gallop at full speed." 

Madden points out that our present use of the 
word "career," as defined by Dr. Furness, is 
not at all what was present to the mind of 
Shakespeare. 

" We mean something that continues for an indefi- 
nite time. He meant something that soon comes to an 
abrupt ending. . . . The length of the career was four 
or five score yards at the most. The essential charac- 
teristic of the career, wherein it differed from the ordi- 
nary gallop, was its abrupt ending, technically known as 
' the stop,' by which the horse was suddenly and firmly 
thrown upon his haunches. Wherever Shakespeare 
uses the word, this stop is present to his mind "(p. 298). 

Thus the word " stop," no less than the word 
"career," is a term of manage, a term used 
again by Leontes near the end of the first scene 
of Act II.: 

" Now, from the Oracle 

They will bring all, whose spirituall counsaile had 
Shall stop, or spurreme." 

Dr. Furness would also have found here some- 
thing to add to his note upon "The Mort o' 
th' Deere" (I., ii., 144), which words, he 
thinks, refer " to the dying sighs of the deer 
rather than to the raucous sound of a horn." 
Madden contributes a third interpretation, ac- 
cording to which the sound of the sighing is 
compared neither to the sound of a horn nor 
to the sighing of the deer. He says: 

" To some, the notes which tell that all is over with 
a noble beast of venery summon up sad associations, for 
Leonatus (sic), among the tokens of woman's frailty, 
includes 

4 To sigh, as 'twere 
The Mort o' th' Deere.' 

This feeling was certainly not generally shared by sports- 
men," etc. 

In other words, the sighs of the supposed lovers 
are such sighs as would escape a person of 
effeminate sympathies at hearing the blast of 
the horns in token that the deer was slain. 

Madden also suggests a metaphor from the 
chase as the key to some words of Hermione 
which have been regarded as among the ob- 
scurest in the play : 

" With what encounter so uncurrant, I 
Have strayn'd t' appeare thus." (III., ii., 51). 

He quotes from "The Noble Arte of Venerie" : 
" When he (the hart) runneth verie fast, then 
he streyneth." Madden is probably right in 
thinking that this interpretation of the word 



14 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



"strayn'd" disposes of the guesses of some of 
the commentators (strayed, stained); but the 
real stumbling-block is in the preceding line, 
and one still gets no convincing answer to the 
question what "encounter so uncurrant"? 

Mr. Justice Madden's researches, in the light 
of his special knowledge of field-sports, have 
disclosed many other facts of interest to stu- 
dents of Shakespeare. The race-horse is, it 
appears, " the only horse in whom and in whose 
doings Shakespeare took no interest, and the 
horse-race is the only popular pastime to which 
no allusion can be found in his writings." To 
bear-baiting there are many allusions, all of 
which suggest dislike or contempt for the 
sport. Baconian fanatics will get little comfort 
from the discovery that in Bacon there are no 
references of any significance to field-sports, 
for which even the " studious recluse " who 
wrote the "Anatomy of Melancholy" mani- 
fests some enthusiasm (p. 223). Madden 
makes a half-humorous classification of Shakes- 
peare's works upon the basis of his allusions to 
horses, and the classification is as judicious 
as some others that have been made. In " Venus 
and Adonis" he celebrates the home-bred En- 
glish horse ; but before beginning his English 
historical plays he becomes acquainted with the 
merits of the Eastern horse and his conception 
of the perfect horse was changed. The roan 
Barb, "prince of palfreys," appears and re- 
appears in these plays. Madden thinks that 
Shakespeare was personally able to say, as early 
as 1592, "This roan shall be my throne." 

" Indeed, if I were disposed to adopt the language 
of criticism, I should class the historical plays as the 
roan Barbary group. In the tragedies we meet with 
Barbary horses now and then, but ' the bonny beast he 
loved so well ' is no more. Can one wonder that the 
period when they were written was, in Professor Dow- 
den's language, a period of depression and gloom?" 
(p. 262^. 

Perhaps the most interesting result of these 
researches is that they have led in all cases 
of dispute to the support of the readings of the 
Folio as opposed to those of the quartos. In 
view of this, it seems strange that Madden 
should twice refer to the " thirty-four " plays 
in the Folio (there are thirty-six), and should 
twice silently alter the Folio reading in a quota- 
tion from the Winter's Tale. In borrowing the 
words of the shepherd, " I would there were no 
age between ten and three and twenty," Madden 
in two places prints, " age between sixteen and 
three and twenty." These and a few other 
oversights, one of which has already been ex- 
emplified (Leonatus for Leontes), are very 



nearly the only faults I can find in this inter- 
esting and instructive book. 

I have left myself too little space in which 
to speak adequately of Mr. George Wyndham's 
edition of the Poems of Shakespeare *- a work 
certainly not second in importance to either 
of those we have been considering. Let me 
say at once, without going into detail, that this 
seems to me to be the completest edition for the 
student. For enjoyment of the poetry, nothing 
could be better than the Temple edition. In his 
notes Mr. Wyndham has met the main difficul- 
ties with the patience and acuteness of a scholar. 
He discusses in detail the identity of the rival 
poet (or poets) and of the youth addressed in 
the first series of sonnets. He inclines to Dray ton 
as the rival poet, and thinks that Tyler's argu- 
ment for William Herbert and Mary Fitton 
might win a verdict from a Scotch jury. If he 
means that the verdict would be " not proven," 
I heartily agree with him. He believes, however, 
that such attempts at identification must "prove 
detrimental to an aesthetic appreciation " of the 
lyrical excellence of the Sonnets. He admits, 
what so many critics have urged, that the 
Sonnets " express Shakespeare's own feelings 
in his own person " (Dowden). But he deems 
it " equally true, and vastly more important, 
that the Sonnets are not an Autobiography." 
Accordingly, at least half of the hundred and 
forty pages of his sympathetic and well-written 
introduction are devoted to a consideration of 
the poems as works of art. This is a refresh- 
ing innovation ; would that it might mark an 
epoch ! His texts are based upon the earliest 
editions, the readings of which he has adhered 
to, whenever possible, and all the variations are 
conscientiously set down in the notes. The 
chief weakness of Mr. Wyndham is that he 
seems unable to find the holes in Tyler's argu- 
ments. But he has a true appreciation of the 
Sonnets and the other poems, and his remarks 
upon these are at once instructive and com- 
forting. 

Mr. Sidney Lee's Life of Shakespeare is based 
upon the already well-known article which ap- 
peared last year in the " Dictionary of National 
Biography," and which is here expanded and 
provided with a long appendix, containing ex- 
haustive discussions of several interesting ques- 
tions. It is especially significant that, after 
" very narrow scrutiny," Mr. Lee rejects the 
claim made for the Sonnets to rank as autobio- 
graphical material. His detailed discussion of 
this subject is of interest to all students of the 
great poet. Perhaps by virtue of his patient

investigations and cogent exposition future gen- 
erations will be able to read the Sonnets without 
thinking of the delectable amours of William 
Herbert and Mary Fitton. Those whose minds 
have been tainted by the reading of Dr. Bran- 
des's romance about Shakespeare (misnamed 
" a critical study ") will find Mr. Lee's book 
an effective antiseptic. It is provided with 
a good index. 

Mr. Fleming's " How to Study Shakespeare " 
may be commended with some confidence to read- 
ing-clubs and to individual beginners. Its prin- 
cipal features are, first, a collection of selected 
annotations to eight of the more popular plays ; 
secondly, a number of questions upon the plot 
and structure of each of these plays, questions 
which will encourage the student to think about 
what he has read.

THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION.* 



The first volume of Mr. Hannis Taylor's 
history of the English Constitution, which now 
extends to twelve hundred octavo pages, was 
published nearly ten years ago. In the preface 
to that volume, as on the title-page to both first 
and second, the reader is informed that here 
" is drawn out " the " development of the En- 
glish constitutional system, and the growth out 
of that system of the federal republic of the 
United States." This is " a large order " even 
for twelve hundred pages ; and a survey of the 
contents does not justify the statement. Aside 
from an introductory chapter of eighty pages, 
in which "the English origin of the federal 
republic " is necessarily somewhat scantily 
treated, this history is occupied with the growth 
of English institutions on English soil. 

It may be said at the outset that Mr. Taylor 
has made a useful compend. Among the mul- 
titude of works on the English Constitution 
which have seen the light since Dr. Stubbs 
made the subject popular in 1875, there has 
been produced no adequate sketch of the whole 
field. Stubbs's great work in three volumes 
was intended only to bring the student to the 
point where Hallam began his work with the 
Tudors ; and Hallam, wonderful as his genius 
was in his day, is too ancient to be a guide for 
the present age inquirer. Anson's fine descrip- 
tion of " The Law and Custom of the Consti- 

* THE ORIGIN AND GKOWTH OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITU- 
TION. By Hannis Taylor. Volume II. Boston : Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 



tution " deals with things as they are, rather 
than as they have come to be. Medley's text- 
book, made only four years ago, would be just 
the needed work, if he had not adopted the 
bewildering method of chasing up and down 
the centuries to trace each institution from 
start to finish in a separate section. One who 
reads is in the state of mind of Yankee Doodle, 
who could not see the town for the houses. 
This is most unfortunate, for Mr. Medley covers 
the ground, and is judicious and critical in his 
dependence upon authorities. Moreover, he has 
read his subject and is up to date. Taswell- 
Langmead's one-volume history is a fine piece 
of work, but neglects some important aspects of 
the subject, and is now twenty-three years old, 
and therefore hardly up to date. Only the 
great master, Stubbs, in the face of the large 
additions made to our knowledge in the last 
fifteen years by Maitland and Round, Vino- 
gradoff and Liebermann, and the school of 
" diggers " which they represent, can grow old 
creditably. Gneist is nearly as shelf-worn as 
Taswell, and in addition has that color blind- 
ness to the inner truth of English institutions 
not to be wondered at in one nursed under the 
shadow of the Prussian bureaucracy. 

Mr. Taylor is not so much a scholar as a 
popularizer of the work of scholars. It would be 
hard to find in his pages anything original, and 
his references show that he has worked largely, 
not with " sources," but with authorities. In 
the main he has chosen his authorities well, 
and although not as keen in his evaluation of 
them as is Medley, he cites continually the 
master workers, from Stubbs down. Still, one 
would hardly guess through his guidance that 
Green is not an authority for any period since 
the Conquest, or that he does not rank with 
Gardiner, or even with Lingard on the seven- 
teenth century. One misses the flavor, too, of 
the great scholars mentioned after Stubbs in 
the preceding paragraph, and finds himself 
wondering if Mr. Taylor knows them well. In 
the light of what they have done since he first 
began to publish, a large portion of his first 
volume will need to be rewritten for a new 
edition, and that speedily, if this work is to 
hold its place as a convenient vade mecum. 

It is not a light undertaking to provide a 
readable and accurate sketch of the many cen- 
turies that such a history as this covers, and 
the critic who himself has spent many years of 
study in this field is likely to be the most char- 
itable one. Mr. Taylor has put this story of 
the constitution into the vigorous and graceful 



16 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



English of which he is a master, and he has 
also kept always before him the larger move- 
ment of the national life whose details he dis- 
cusses, so that the inexperienced reader may 
be entrusted to his guidance with the assurance 
that he will not miss the " form and pressure " 
of the times through which he passes. And 
yet at times there is blundering in details 
which makes one feel that portions of the nar- 
rative deal with subjects that were " gotten 
up " solely for this narrative, and that the 
writer of it has never entered their atmosphere. 
When one reads in the first volume about ven- 
derers in connection with the forest courts, even 
although the word is repeated in this mis- 
spelled form in the margin and in the table of 
contents, he lays the blunder to the account of 
careless proof-reading ; but when, after eight 
years of waiting, he comes to the index in the 
second volume, and, looking in vain for verder- 
ers> reads only the old error repeated, he is 
inclined to wonder. When one reads at the 
beginning of this second volume, just as he did 
in the earlier volume, that " the development 
of military tenures in England was gradual," 
and that " the transition from the military sys- 
tem by the thegn's service to the new system 
by knight service was also gradual," he feels 
that all the words so recently and so well said 
by Mr. Round on that subject have been writ- 
ten in vain. So the recent pushing back by Mr. 
Round of the scutage composition from the 
fourth year of Henry II. to a date at least as 
early as the reign of Henry I., finds no recog- 
nition ; and the author, in spite even of Stubbs, 
finds the last vestiges of scutage in 1332. Tal- 
lage is a good enough word for Stubbs and 
Maitland, Vinogradoff and Dowell ; we see no 
reason for giving us tattiage. Hubert Hall on 
the " Customs Revenues " might correct the 
statement that " prisage " was " the right to 
take from each English or foreign wine ship one 
cask out of every ten " the italics are ours. 
In the third line, on page 39, the occurrence 
of the word " and," when " but " is the proper 
word, makes nonsense ; and even with the cor- 
rection one does not learn what is vital to an 
understanding of the statement that Henry 
Prince of Wales, when fourteen years of age, 
was required to repudiate his betrothal to 
Katharine, that his father's foreign policy had 
changed since the betrothal. The doubt that 
is apparently expressed on page 82, whether 
the appropriation by the crown of the lands of 
the monastic houses in 1536 was confiscation, 
seems to be grounded on the contention that 



it was not unconstitutional, and in its confound- 
ing of principles suggests the remarkable posi- 
tion maintained by Mr. Taylor in a recent num- 
ber of the " North American Review " concern- 
ing the moral quality of our " steal " from 
Mexico in 1848. The writer knows no more 
in the second volume than he did in the first 
that the court baron was probably not coeval 
in its beginnings with the court leet and the 
customary court, and yet Viuogradoff pub- 
lished his English edition of " Villainage in 
England " in 1892. We are told that commis- 
sioners of array were " employed by the crown 
as early as the fourteenth century," and referred 
in a footnote to 1324, although Stubbs in his 
second volume has much to say about them 
from 1282 on. 

One of the things that need most to be done 
for students of American institutions is to trace 
adequately the evolution of English local insti- 
tutions down to the time when the founders of 
our American states came away. This is espe- 
cially needed for the system of courts. Pollock 
and Maitland have done the work exhaustively 
down to 1272 in their great " History of En- 
glish Law," but a more general survey of the 
whole field is desirable to thread the way 
through the maze of local jurisdictions and itin- 
erant commissions which gradually gave place 
to the more modern system which our fathers 
brought to the new home over seas. One looks 
with assurance for this in a work designed to 
trace the growth of the federal republic out of 
the English system. But this work is still to 
be done, although Mr. Taylor's occasional ex- 
cursions into that field suggest that he might 
have given a satisfactory account had he es- 
sayed the task. In fact, throughout the book 
one feels that the institutional side has not been 
sufficiently recognized, and is inclined to class 
this work rather with Gardiner and Froude and 
Green, among the narrative histories which 
deal principally with political history, than with 
the treatises of Hallam and Stubbs. The two 
chapters which treat of the Civil War and the 
Protectorate are outside the Constitution, and 
the space might better have been utilized in 
presenting some of the interesting constitu- 
tional conflicts of the Stuart period between 
the two houses or between the houses and the 
law courts. Attention to Pike's recent work 
on the " Constitutional History of the House 
of Lords," which finds no recognition, might 
have been fruitful of suggestion in that direc- 
tion. Still, it may be said that no better nar- 
rative of the bulk and scope of this one can be

and Freeman and Norgate on the Normans and 
Angevins through Gardiner in the seventeenth 
century to Lecky in the eighteenth and Wai-

institutions and processes, he is in most reput-

FOB THE STAGE OR THE STUDY.* 

Almost every age of English literature has 
proved the vitality and the national character 
of the legend of King Arthur by translating it 
into its own language. Geoffrey made it a chron- 
icle, Malory made it a romance of chivalry, 
Spenser made it a renaissance epic, Milton 
might have made it but Milton is the great 
exception. Blackmore I never read, and so 
cannot say what he did about the matter. In 
the time just before our own, Swinburne, 
Matthew Arnold, William Morris put life into 
certain bits of the old story, and Tennyson gave 
it a form that was characteristic of himself and 
his time. Is the time ripe for a new expression ? 
Literature has lived quickly in the last twenty 
years : in a way, we are no longer Tennyson- 
ians. Has enough something been secreted to 
enable a new poet to write of Arthur and still 
be original ? 

Mr. Hovey, who has just completed " Laun- 
celot and Guenevere," which he began some 
years ago, practically offers his work to a very 
searching test. I may as well say at once that 
much of it does not appeal to me. Why mingle 
Scandinavian and German and Greek mythol- 
ogy with Celtic mysteries ? I am as confused 
as poor old Merlin was by this kaleidoscope of 
Norns and Goblins and Angels and Bassarids. 
Or, in the second play, why spend so much 
trouble in showing the world that Arthur was 
the real adulterer, not Launcelot ? I fear that 
not even a mystical moralist will be thus pla- 
cated. Then why, when all 's over and done, 
is there no end ? I believe there are to be other 
plays, but I mean an end to this third play. 

* LAUNCELOT AND GUENEVERE : A Poem in Dramas. 
I. Merlin, a Masque. II. The Marriage of Guenevere, a Trag- 
edy. III. The Birth of Galahad, a Romantic Drama. By 
Richard Hovey. Boston : Small, Maynard & Co. 



What has all the scheming and plotting done 
but throw a little more dust into the already 
darkened eyes of the king? 

These objections seem to me to go pretty 
deep, for they show a lack of creative power. 
They also show what is more to the present 
purpose, namely, an absence of character of 
the time. Our time will stand visions, and also 
a certain amount of material anachronism. But 
the mingling together of half-a-dozen mythol- 
ogies, pagan and Christian, is an artistic incon- 
gruity very uncharacteristic of the present. 
Further, however, our time will stand a good 
deal of immorality, or even of cynical disdain 
of current morals ; but it does not care to have 
passion try to justify itself by other laws than 
its own. "The Marriage of Guenevere" is 
based on the idea that Guenevere was truly 
married to Launcelot ; which is a matter of 
no importance in the minds of most people 
nowadays. We can stand justification by fate, 
as with Tristram and Isolde ; but justification 
by accident seems, to me at least, absurd 
and even gross. Then, lastly, the present time 
will stand even heroics ; but it wants the old- 
time swordsman to be approved by some law 
higher than the sword. We do not want alle- 
gory, to be sure, but we do want something a 
little more grown-up than fights and rescues 
and escapes and love-trysts. 

Taken by and large, then, we can hardly 
accept this rendering. I do not say every ren- 
dering of the Arthurian legend must be char- 
acteristic of its time. But the great ones have 
been, and any rendering that is not runs the 
danger of being the outcome of a striving to be 
different, which rarely brings about large re- 
sults. So I am not much taken by these poems 
in general : in the details, on the other hand, 
I find much that is delightful. I feel the charm 
of the girlhood of Guenevere, and also (al- 
though an anti-neo-celticist) of her song in the 
palace of Cameliard. I think the last words of 
" The Marriage of Guenevere " make a fine 
ending. I like especially to look out on the 
fresh barbarian British from the crumbling 
walls of the worn-out empire. These things 
are good and typical, and other things, too, are 
good, as the reader will easily see for himself. 

So far, however, nothing has been said that 
might not have been said were these plays poQms 
and nothing more ; and this is manifestly wrong. 
For we have here, obviously, productions in- 
tended for the stage. At any rate, they are 
fortified by copyright " as dramatic composi- 
tion," and, indeed, I believe that Mr. Hovey 



18 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



considers himself more of a playwright than 
a poet. Doubtless he meant these plays to be 
acted. 

This is a matter which interests me. Can we 
read these plays with a satisfaction perfect in 
its kind and of a good kind, or must we lay them 
by with an unfinished feeling while we wait for 
an appreciative manager who will bring them 
out somewhere where we may never see them ? 
Or, in other words, is it ever really worth while 
to read a play ? 

These dramas of Mr. Hovey's furnish mate- 
rial for some observations on this point. Let us 
take the first one, "The Quest of Merlin, 
a Masque." As we all know, the Masque 
vanished from the public stage some time since. 
If this masque ever comes to be performed, it 
will, however, in a measure answer the same 
tastes on the part of an audience that the old 
masques did. These tastes were, I suppose, 
speaking very generally, the same that exist in 
the mind of an audience nowadays that gathers 
at the performance of any grand spectacular 
play. The masques were not exactly ballets, but 
they depended immensely on costume, dancing, 
and scenery. They had the accompaniment, also, 
of music and of poetry, sometimes of very beau- 
tiful poetry. But the spectacular elements were 
very important and often enormously elaborate. 
Indeed, I think that the poetry, even when by 
John Milton, was a minor consideration with the 
on-lookers. It seems almost as if this must have 
been so. Consider an audience, even of the most 
cultivated : what will seize their immediate in- 
terest when both are offered at once ; beautiful 
dancing, elaborate and gorgeous scenery and 
costume, things that strike the passive eye 
and mind irresistibly, or poetry, of which the 
greatest charm is that it stimulates the imagi- 
nation and makes the mind active through the 
unconscious service of the eye or ear ? I cannot 
resist the idea that the poetry in a masque must 
have always passed more or less unappreciated. 
It is true that the Elizabethans had a taste for 
oratorical poetry, if I may so call it, which we 
have not ; but I fancy that even an Elizabethan, 
like anyone else, must have given his attention 
chiefly to the beautiful things that presented 
themselves outright to his eye and ear, and only 
in a minor way to the poetry which would have 
forced him to imagine, to feel, to sympathize. 
Now, in Mr. Hovey's masque the poetry is the 
main thing. Yet I cannot conceive these succes- 
sive entries on the stage of angels, bassarids, 
maenads, fairies, elves, loves, valkyrs, maidens, 
these anti-masques of satyrs, fauns, goblins, 



gnomes, without at the same time imagining the 
poetry relegated to a wholly secondary place. I 
think of myself at a production of the masque, 
probably not catching much of what was sung, 
not noticing what was accompanied by a charm- 
ing dance, and in various natural ways overlook- 
ing the poetry. On the other hand, as I read 
it, the masques and the anti-masques are second- 
ary : I imagine them but feebly, for my mind 
is taken up with the poetry, is taken up with 
those little black characters* that demand in- 
terpretation by me, by the very mind that is 
vaguely conceiving the bassarids and gnomes. 
Here the poetry has a chance : I can pause over 
it, think over it, dream over it, if I so de- 
sire. In other words, I am doing an entirely 
different thing from sitting passively at a 
theatre with some hundreds of others. I am 
alone, and my mind has to work if it expects 
to get anything. 

Two different things we have here. This par- 
ticular masque is good, if it suits either case. 
The greatest masques serve both. 

And not so very different is the case with 
" The Marriage of Guenevere, a Tragedy," and 
" The Birth of Galahad, a Romantic Drama." 
Here in a less degree, could we see them on the 
stage, would the poetry as poetry be lost. I take 
what seems to me the best scene in the first play, 
that in which Guenevere first appears. The 
beauty of the opening song would be lost or 
subordinated in a performance, but the dialogue 
between the handsome girl and the disappointed 
woman of the world would be much more effect- 
ive ; Dagonet might be humorous in a perform- 
ance according to the actor and the business, but 
the full sense of his jesting can be perceived 
only in reading ; the general entry of king, 
queen, and court would be much more effective 
on the stage, but the succeeding scenes, Guene- 
vere and her mother, Guenevere alone, and then 
with her brother, these are very different 
things as seen and as read, and it is hard to say 
that either would be better : the end of the act 
would probably be more effective on the stage. 
The stage performance would give something, 
certainly, but it would as certainly lack some- 
thing. 

I am very fond of the theatre. I incline to 
think that I enjoy seeing a play more than I do 
reading one.f But I believe the reason for this 
lies largely in the many attendant circumstances 
that always accompany theatre-going : the un- 
conscious effect of the public place, the people

f I find at least that I habitually pay more for the privilege.

you go with, the other people there, the lights, 
and what not. I doubt if I should enjoy a play 
in the same way if I could look out of my win- 
dow at any time and see a stage with a play upon 
it, as I sat in my room by myself. But aside 
from that matter, I can hardly think that the 
pleasure at the theatre and the pleasure of read- 
ing poetry have so very much in common. 

This is, perhaps, something of an excursus. 
But here are plays meant to be acted ; and I 
have not seen them acted. What am I to do ? 
Read them and say, " In a tentative, general, 
and altogether indecisive way, I imagine that 
the plays, if they ever reach the stage, may be 
thus and so ? " Could I say that ? Of course 
not. Here are poems. They are printed in 
books ; as books they come to me, and as books 
I read them. They are poems : but the author 
has chosen to write them in dramatic form. It 
pleased him, or it enabled him to put certain 
things he could not otherwise, or he thought it 
would call ideas to my mind in such and such 
a way, or something of the sort. Will anyone 
ever act these plays ? I have no idea, nor, for 
the purposes of present enjoyment, do I in the 
least care. If ever the dramatic performance 
comes, I will welcome it gladly and allow myself 
to be stirred and moved by the glittering magic 
of the charm put in action by poet, actor, 
musician, scene-painter, costumer, property- 
man, and I do n't know who else. But now 
I am by myself, and I read ; the books, for 
the moment, are all I know, or need to know, 
either. 

But why so much bother on a matter that 
nobody ever troubles his head about ? Why not 
tell us whether they are good plays or not ? 

Ah, that is another matter : I fear I have 
written enough already.

THE experiment of the University of Chicago in es- 
tablishing a down town college, and arranging its courses 
at such times as would suit the convenience of the 
teachers of the city and others who could not enter the 
regular classes at the University, has met with a success 
beyond the expectations of the warmest friends of the 
movement. The determination of the University to 
admit without examination all teachers who are gradu- 
ates of the Chicago High Schools, or an equivalent 
course, and the lowering of the fees to them, has helped 
both the University and the public. At the opening of 
the College few thought that the enrollment would be 
more than 100 or 150, but there are already 286 ma- 
triculants, nearly all teachers, and about 150 schools 
are represented. All the classes begun in October will 
continue until the first of April, and new classes will 
begin with the present month. 



DISCUSSIONS OF THE SOCIAL, MOVEMENT, 
THEORETICAL, AND PRACTICAL,.* 

In " The Logical Process of Social Development " 
we have, in the words of the author, " a theoretical 
attempt to introduce orderly arrangement into the 
study of the phenomena of social life by the rigid 
application of a single logical hypothesis the selec- 
tive survival of sociological types." The main topics 
are the societary process, the sociological postulates, 
the sociological axioms, and the sociological prin- 
ciples. The societary process is from the natural, 
organic or animal, upward to the ideal, and involves 
in succession consciousness of typal kinship, of typal 
conditions, of typal relations, and of typal possibili- 
ties. Progress is mediated by sociological types 
which are defined to be either " a potentially normal 
type of personality or a theoretically superior type 
of social organization projected as a goal of practice." 
The sociological postulates are the social situation, 
which secures the type from dissolution ; the social 
interests, which set up a tendency to variation ; the 
social system, in which tendencies are coordinated ; 
and the social mind, in which the ideals of a higher 
state become curative and harmonizing forces. 

Under the head of sociological axioms are dis- 
cussed typicality, normality, institutionality, and 
ideality. The main purpose of the work is to show 
that human association rises above and upon a purely 
organic state toward an ideal state of personality and 
organization, by a constant process of selecting and 
acting upon new types of being. It is the function 
of sociology to formulate the materials of the various 
sciences in a way to guide this process. The normal 
tendency toward the higher type can be compre- 
hended by scientific method, and errors of direction 
may be corrected. When these ideals and methods 
have been thus formulated we have a more reliable 
basis for the pedagogic art. " Social policy must

take into account (1) the facts or conditions of natu- 
ral association, (2) the forces that belong to social 
organization, and (3) the coordination of these fac- 
tors in the individuation of the type of character that 
normally tends to prevail toward the ideal. The social 
process being a type-developing process, educational 
policy must organize knowledge and its uses to that 
supreme end." 

The practised student of sociology will derive 
many original and thought-provoking hints from this 
orderly and systematic treatment. In the circles 
of specialists it will be one of the books for fruitful 
criticism and debate. For persons not already well 
equipped for close reasoning, the book will require 
a translator ; for the technical terms and the words 
used in a sense peculiar to the author will bewilder 
the amateur. Under a hard crust there is solid food 
for adults. The formulas or principles proposed need 
to be used with great caution. It is so easy to accept 
imaginative constructions as verified laws of reality. 
It is true that the author calls his theory a hypothesis, 
and warns us that it is to be used as a guide to induc- 
tion. But the mode of discussion is such that the 
incautious student may be strongly tempted to em- 
ploy this hypothesis as a premiss for deduction, and 
in some parts of the book the author himself seems 
under control of this tendency. The corrective, 
however, is suggested in the array of the scientific 
preparation required for discovery of the ideal type 
and of the necessary means of its realization. 

In the treatment of the social ideal, does our 
author give a suitable place of dignity and value to 
the creative minds in literature? He declares that 
science and religion are the two sources of the ideals 
toward which progressive society normally tends. 
But in no place is a distinct or at least adequate 
place assigned to the greatest poets and literary 
artists who, apart from beautiful forms of speech, 
have helped us to see life as it is and to see it as a 
whole. Without Shakespeare, Goethe, Dante, 
Browning, Tennyson, the scientific and philosoph- 
ical and theological formulations of social ideals 
would be empty as a drum and cold as steel. Ab- 
stract thinkers, system-builders, offer us a strong 
osseous skeleton, but great literature reveals the 
warm heart, the sensitive nerves, the rounded flesh, 
the perfect form, and, best of all, the endlessly va- 
ried yet harmonious world of sentiments, hopes, 
fears, and mysteries of the inmost spirit. 

It is the mind of a master which carries us for- 
ward in the lucid argument of " Democracy and 
Social Growth in America." The appeal is to facts 
commonly known ; the interpretation is that of a 
man familiar with economic and political history. 
Equality belongs to simple rural conditions, and 
those conditions gave us a democracy. Industrial 
revolution has caused inequality and complexity and 
a pure democracy is impossible. There is an inev- 
itable tendency to bring industry under some form 
of political control, and so far the Socialists have 
rightly interpreted the process of history. But 
those who imagine that Socialism will make presi- 



dents of railroads and section-hands change places 
each month or year, or who fancy that the highest 
places will be easily reached, build on the shadows 
of dreams. Inequality and conflict will continue 
under all forms of government. The last chapter 
is a noble plea for a " political revival," for the 
preaching of social duty above individual rights, for 
simplicity of living, for standards of goodness, 
intelligence, and taste, to compete with the social 
criterion of wealth, and for religion as a necessary 
conservative force. The teaching of this volume 
should be pondered by everyone who desires to appre- 
ciate and promote the most sane, elevated, and inspir- 
ing ideals of our economic and political movement. 

Sombart's popular and sympathetic lectures on 
Socialism have been translated in a delightful way 
by Rev. Anson P. Atterbury, and Professor J. B. 
Clark thinks the book worth a special introduction 
from his pen. A social movement is defined to be 
" the aggregate of all those endeavors of a social 
class which are directed to a rational overturning 
of an existing social order to suit the interests of a 
class." The central aim of the movement in this 
century is toward a socialistic, communal order of 
society, in place of the existing method of private 
ownership. The formation of the proletariat is 
shown to be the inevitable result of capitalistic 
modes of production. Misery, contrast, uncertainty 
spring from the same system, and the intensity of 
all life heightens class feeling. The Utopian forms 
of Socialism, the agitation of Lassalle, the masterly 
discussions of Marx, and the tendencies toward unity 
in all lands where the wage-class has been formed, 
are neatly described. The lesson from the history 
of Socialism is that class strife is the cause of move- 
ment and progress, but that strife should be carried 
on within legal limits and without the poisoned 
weapons of hate, revenge, and misrepresentation. 

Monsieur Louis Proal is a French judge who has 
contributed important works to the discussion of 
crime and punishment. In the work on Political 
Crime the main topics are the anti-social actions 
done in the name of government, Machiavelism, 
assassination and tyrannicide, anarchism, political 
hatreds and hypocrisy, spoilation under legal forms, 
partisan corruption, electoral corruption, corruption 
of law and justice by politics, and the corruption of 
morals by evil example in high places. The plan 
of the author is to present historical illustrations of 
these subjects from ancient, mediaeval, and modern 
sources. The result is a rogue's gallery of very 
forbidding pictures, and the effect is depressing. 
Strictly speaking, many of these actions are not 
legally criminal, because they do not come under 
the condemnation and penalty of particular statutes ; 
but they are all instances of violation of the " higher 
law " of social and international morality. At this 
moment we have experience of the subversive influ- 
ence of war, even in as righteous a cause as one can 
imagine. Acts which in times of peace were called 
lying, treachery, robbery, and murder are now the 
duty and the business of representatives of national

honor. The contradictions of the situation, if long 
continued, would destroy the socializing and elevat- 
ing influences of generations of peaceful education. 
So awful is the responsibility for world-wide retro- 
gression of those who force upon us war. Monsieur 
Proal has massed his illustrations in an effective 
way, and he has compelled us to judge all the con- 
duct of parties, rulers, and nations by the standards 
of ideal ethics. The author misses no opportunity 
to expose the destructive tendency of social agitators 
who poison and irritate the minds of men and sub- 
vert the moral judgments on which the security of 
life, person, property, and culture rest. He believes 
the ills of society are far more due to defective ideals 
and morals than to economic suffering. He sees 
clearly that educated men must take hold of the 
work of social education in earnest. " Those who 
do not defend society betray it. To the proselytism 
of evil must be opposed the proselytism of good. 
It is the strict duty of all those who have the good 
fortune to hold salutary beliefs, derived from their 
education, their family, or their studies, to propa- 
gate them, and not to allow sophisms to pass with- 
out challenge. . . . The real remedy for the crisis 
we are traversing is a return to Christianity." 

The wage-worker is daily haunted by the fear of 
sickness or accident which may reduce or suspend 
his earning power, by the dread of old age and death, 
with all their possible consequences to his family. 
The process of saving a sufficient hoard to provide 
for all these emergencies is painfully slow and un- 
certain. For the vast majority of men it is next to 
impossible to erect a fortress of accumulated wealth 
whose interest will be a wall of protection against 
extreme destitution. Americans have not yet been 
compelled to face this situation, because most men 
could escape from the vicissitudes of city life to the 
relatively certain income of the isolated farm home- 
stead. The rapid transformation of a great popu- 
lation into a manufacturing community is compelling 
reflecting and far-seeing men to cast about for meas- 
ures which will remove the terrors of poverty and 
beggary in times of feebleness and loss of bread- 
winning power. Benjamin Franklin's method was to 
save the pennies and lend the capital. That would be 
adequate for his age, but it is not applicable in our 
conditions. Individualism breaks down under the 
circumstances of urban life and the factory system, 
and men have the choice between some form of col- 
lectivism and pauperism, which is itself communism 
in disgrace. At this point of transition we may 
avail ourselves of the experience of older countries, 
and when we come to organize our insurance against 
sickness, accident, old age, death, and even unem- 
ployment, or shall not be compelled to try experi- 
ments in the dark. Mr. W. F. Willoughby has set 
before the American reader and student a clear, 
concise, and accurate account of the aims, scope, 
methods, and results of " Workingmen's Insurance " 
in all civilized countries. Mr. John Graham Brooks 
had already presented an admirable account of the 
German system of State insurance, and his book is 



not altogether superseded by this work, which covers 
wider ground. Perhaps there is no single measure 
relating to the welfare of the wage-workers in Amer- 
ica, next to the question of wages, so important as 
this matter of insurance. Our Building and Loan 
Associations are growing in wealth and favor ; but 
they are by no means adequate, and they do riot 
touch the demand of the average urban laborer. 
The trade unions of the better class do very much 
in case of unemployment and sickness ; but their 
insurance work is still based on crude actuarial cal- 
culations and is avowedly subordinate to the fighting 
function of the union. The " benevolent " societies 
and some of the great railroad companies have made 
fair beginnings in the right direction. The author 
rightly directs attention to the vital principle of acci- 
dent insurance, now universally accepted in Europe 
but scarcely discussed in the United States : that each 
business should provide for losses incurred by acci- 
dents incident to it. Every prudent manufacturer sets 
aside in each inventory a certain per cent for repairs, 
restoration, and loss of machinery, because experi- 
ence shows this to be inevitable. But a similar loss 
is caused to the human beings who make the ma- 
chinery effective, and it is reasonable that this cer- 
tain waste should be borne by the business. Our- 
employer's liability laws are no longer abreast with 
economic conditions. They are based on the old 
conditions, when each man worked alone or in a 
small group, and was responsible for exposure to 
danger. But in a huge factory or on a railroad the 
individual workman is a fixed part of a mass which 
is under military orders and rigid discipline. It is 
unjust to compel him to have a lawsuit with his em- 
ployer every time he crushes a finger or is poisoned 
by chemical fumes. The business should insure 
each workman, and the cost be charged in the price 
of goods to the community. 

Professor Davidson, author of " The Bargain 
Theory of Wages," discusses the wages problem in 
its historical and theoretical aspects. He offers an 
exposition of the subsistence theory, the wages-fund 
theory, the productivity theory, and the bargain 
theory, and shows that these various views are not 
antagonistic but complementary. The phenomena 
to be explained are not social conditions of former 
ages but of our own time. Many of the illustrations 
would be understood most clearly by a resident of 
the maritime provinces of British America, where 
the book was prepared ; but nothing is obscure, and 
the author is constantly in touch with reality. The 
chapter on the mobility of labor should be read by 
those who are free enough from the prejudices of 
capitalistic employers, and also of wage-earners, to 
study impartially the hidden causes of the troubles 
in Illinois coal-fields, where the maddened miners 
and the demagogues are seeking by illegal methods 
to correct the abuses of excessive mobility of labor. 
There is no longer the excuse for migration of work- 
men which existed when Mr. Greeley gave his 
famous advice about going West. Statistics collected 
by Professor Willcox, and given by the author, show

that steady home-making is coming to be the habit of 
our people. Trade-unions are discouraging the tramp 
habit among their own members on both sides of the 
Atlantic. The moral consequences of greater sta- 
bility justify the policy. The problem is to promote 
stability by legislation without restricting liberty of 
travel in search of better conditions. The author 
gives a suggestive illustration of legal restriction of 
imported labor by a heavy tax on the interlopers who 
hurt the trade-unions. The chapters on the influence 
of trade-unions and of methods of remuneration on 
the rate of wages and industrial efficiency of working- 
men are full of fresh and important materials. 

In his work on " Labor Copartnership," Mr. 
Henry D. Lloyd has set before the public, in his 
usual forceful way, the more recent developments of 
one form of the cooperative movement in Great 
Britain. The materials were collected during a 
personal visit to the chief centres of the movement 
in Ireland, Scotland, and England. The author is 
an enthusiastic advocate and prophet of that form 
of cooperation in which the producing agents, the 
direct workers, share in profits, responsibilities, and 
management. The arguments of Mrs. Webb on the 
side of the English custom of dividing profits among 
shareholders are not fully set forth, and Mrs. Webb's 
book must be read along with this one in order to 
have the whole case in mind. Mr. Lloyd writes 
with the faith and fervor of a socialistic seer, but he 
certainly gives solid statistical grounds for his hopes. 
Those who are content to measure the future of 
industrial democracy by the past are quite likely to 
miss the germinating forces of the present. A de- 
voted coOperationist may be a dreamer of dreams, 
but when one-seventh of the population of a great 
realm has become interested in a scheme which is 
backed already by one hundred millions of property, 
and has more capital than it can invest, we may 
excuse the enthusiasm. All who sincerely desire to 
see general growth in business ability, self-govern- 
ment, and independent position of the workers, are 
justified in studying British cooperation with hope 
and confidence. If the " proletariate " really has 
the power and ability to direct the gigantic enter- 
prises of modern business, it must prove this by 
cooperative success in production, not by mere blus- 
ter and flattery of demagogues. The conservative 
doubt and scorn and the optimist's hope are not to 
the point : action must be decisive. 

In " Problems of Modern Industry," Mr. and 
Mrs. Webb have published a series of interesting 
essays on various aspects of the labor question, ten- 
ement house life, women's wages, factory acts, hours 
of labor, surating system, poor law, cooperation, 
trade-unions, and the theory of Felian socialism. 
The chapters are crowded with interesting and sug- 
gestive materials, and the closing papers reveal the 
most recent phases of English collectivism. 

A new and enlarged edition of Mr. Thomas G. 
Shearman's " Natural Taxation " brings before the 
public a modified form of Henry George's theory of 
taxation. Mr. Shearman's doctrine, in contrast with 



that of Mr. George, is thus stated (p. 226): "The ob- 
jection to the alleged inelasticity of the tax applies to 
that full and rather forced measure of taxation advo- 
cated by Henry George, taking the whole economic 
rent, so far as it is possible to do so, for the use of the 
State." The additions in the new edition are replies 
to objections and an analysis of the incidence of tax- 
ation. The refutation of the single tax, by Professor 
Seligman, is the text of this fresh presentation of the 
plea for making land-values the sole object of the 
assessor's zeal. The matter is presented in the con- 
cise, clear, and cogent, if somewhat one-sided, style 
of a very able lawyer advocate. There is much just 
criticism of the iniquities of current methods, and the 
book deserves careful and candid consideration. 

The British archives have preserved most inter- 
esting records of the commercial dealings between 
the colonies and the mother country. In " Industrial 
Experiments," by Eleanor Louisa Lord, the author 
draws upon these documents of the period previous 
to the Revolution for materials which throw light on 
the economical causes of the conflict which issued in 
political independence. The chief topic of this mono- 
graph is the attempt of the British government to 
compel or induce New England to furnish it naval 
supplies. The statesmen in control imagined that 
they understood the economic interests of the colonies 
better than the colonists. Gradually the children were 
becoming industrially independent, and when the 
time came to enforce a fiscal policy which seemed 
unjust, the young and vigorous communities revealed 
their economic power in war. The monograph pre- 
sents evidence, in a limited field, for the assertion that 
the economists and statesmen of England failed to 
understand the situation in North America, and that 
their error cost the mother country her most valu- 
able dependency. 

The book called "Reality," by Mr. George A. San- 
ders, is put forward as a "reply to Edward Bellamy's 
'Looking Backward' and 'Equality,' " an optimistic 
presentation for the existing industrial system. It can 
hardly be claimed as a novel or profound discussion 
of a well-worn theme. Mr. Bellamy is regarded by 
this author as an impracticable dreamer ; the basis 
of civilization is character and culture ; our indus- 
trial order is the best possible. A chapter of statis- 
tics from Mr. Mulhall is printed. The law of evolution 
is stated. The perils and advantages of mammon- 
ism are set in the balance. The parable of the 
" Masters of Bread " is dissected on a marble table, 
but " brotherly love " comes immediately after as 
a counterpoise. Theological speculation on " what 
God might have done " closes the book. 

Dr. Gladden's work on " The Christian Pastor 
and the Working Church," although published in a 
theological series, is an important contribution to 
the study of social tendencies and institutions. The 
eminent writer has given explicit form to certain 
beliefs and convictions which have been gradually 
shaping themselves in the minds of religious people 
and manifesting themselves in institutions. The 
distinction between " sacred " and " secular " has

broken down at every point, as the church has come 
to believe in the transmutation of species. The 
abandonment of theories of ecclesiastical authority 
and of logical systems of theological speculation 
has driven the people to concentrate attention 
upon practical applications of common religious 
principles to the life of the world. The creeds have 
been condensed from many unverifiable articles into 
a few directly ethical declarations relating to the 
meaning of the universe and the duty of man. It 
was inevitable that the text-books on pastoral duties 
and church work must be re-written. The institu- 
tional church, the organization of voluntary chari- 
ties, the various attempts to socialize selfish conduct 
in politics and business, the recognition of health 
and innocent recreation as suitable subjects for 
ecclesiastical discussion and action, found small 
place in the earlier works which formulated the 
technical education of the preacher and pastor. The 
publishers who selected Dr. Gladden for the task of 
re-stating the theory of the pastoral office according 
to modern lights have made a most happy choice. 
While the discussion is radical and at points revo- 
lutionary, the tone is moderate, the style free from 
exaggeration, the argument considerate, and the 
vital matters of positive Christian conviction are 
not obscured or feebly set forth. The range of 
thought is considerably wider than that covered by 
traditional text-books on pastoral duties. The sub- 
title, " Working Church," indicates the fact that the 
pastor is only one factor in the institution of religion. 
The duties of the pastor and the best methods of 
his professional work are, indeed, carefully treated. 
We see him in his study, in the pulpit, as conductor 
of public services, and as counsellor and guide of 
those who trust him as friend. But the modern 
activities of the other members have vastly increased. 
The Sunday school, the midweek service, evangeli- 
zation, social life, woman's work, associations of 
youth, societies of children, missionary organization s. 
philanthropic enterprises of many forms have grown 
up in response to new social needs and out of the 
inspirations of a renaissance of primitive Christian 
impulse. The Church is simply an instrument of 
service, not an end in itself. In some points the 
volume requires to be supplemented by other works. 
The discussion of charity methods is very brief and 
meagre, although the author insists on the social 
importance of this work. Those who desire to know 
more about the " institutional church " will do well 
to consult Mead's "Modern Methods of Church 
Work," which is not mentioned in this book. The 
plan of the volume did not permit a treatment of 
the many social problems in which the church is 
more or less directly interested as inspirer and or- 
ganizer of the conscience. It is not to be expected that 
all the statements and teachings will be greeted with 
nnanimous approval. Yet one fact remains clear : 
that we have here, for the pastor, the most modern 
practical treatise yet published, sagacious, bal- 
anced, devout, inspiring. ~ TT

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Still another " Life of Marie An- 
toinette"! There is apparently to 
be no end of repetitions of the story 
of the career of this questionable "martyr." This 
time the biographer of " Madame Veto " is Miss 
Clara Tschudi, a popular Norwegian author ; and 
the Macmillan Co. are the American publishers of 
a translation of her book by Mr. E. M. Cope. Miss 
Tschudi is a decidedly pleasant writer, and the 
translator (despite occasional flaws in his English) 
echoes very cleverly her easy, rippling style. Aside 
from its unusual readableness, the best thing about 
Miss Tschudi's book is its sanity of view. Her 
heroine is neither martyr nor monster, but a quite 
intelligible woman who was forced to play a part 
in history that was far too large for her. Miss 
Tschudi's book is thus neither soaked in tears, like 
the tomes of M. de la Rocheterie, whose lamentations 
for his " martyr queen " remind one of Mark Twain 
at the tomb of Adam, nor does it defer too much 
to the republican view of this bad sovereign and 
pity-compelling victim. A "tigress" Marie An- 
toinette certainly was not ; but she was a giddy, 
shallow creature, as ill-fitted as possible for the high 
station to which an ironic destiny called her. While 
deploring her all too tragic end, impartial history 
cannot forget that, in her day of triumph, she had 
no thought for the hard lot of the toiling poor who 
lacked bread while she and her worthless favorites 
were squandering the revenues of France. But her 
nature was a shallow rather than a bad one ; and 
with a better training she would have been a better 
queen. The " Widow Capet " paid in tears and 
blood for the follies of the mistress of the Little 
Trianon ; and we may agree with our author that 
in the hour of misfortune Marie Antoinette devel- 
oped qualities of soul worthy of a daughter of Maria 
Theresa. Miss Tschudi's book is accurate, sensible, 
vivacious ; there is perhaps no better popular Life 
of its heroine. The book is well printed, but an 
occasional slip in the proof-reading must be noted. 
Vergniaud, for instance, is printed " Verginaud." 
There is an attractive frontispiece portrait in colors. 

Ever since the appearance of the 
Revised Version of the Old Testa- 
ment in 1885, there has been a de- 
sire on the part of Bible students for this same ver- 
sion provided with a new set of marginal references. 
Just now, thirteen years after its first appearance, 
we have the desired book. It has been prepared 
by scholars connected with the Universities of Ox- 
ford and Cambridge, and issued from the Oxford 
University Press. This is the British edition newly 
set with the American Preferences at the end, as in 
the regular British Revised Version. The principles 
governing the matter of marginal references in this 
volume are five, as follows : (1) Quotations, or exact 
verbal parallels ; (2) Passages referred to for sim- 
ilarity of idea or of expression ; (3) Passages re-

ferred to by way of explanation or illustration ; 
(4) Historical or geographical references : names of 
persons, places, etc., which recur ; (5) Passages 
referred to as illustrating differences of rendering 
between the Authorized and Revised Versions. Ap- 
propriate signs are used to indicate the character of 
each of the references, so that the reader may know 
in advance just what he is looking for. These same 
principles of reference will save the margins of our 
Bible from the numerous misinterpretations and 
bad exegeses found in the Authorized Version. No- 
tably in the " Song of Songs " do we find the tracks 
of clear-headed workmen, who have not, as in the 
old version, foisted upon us a groundless symbolical 
interpretation. Another commendable feature of 
this Bible is the printing of the verse-numbers in 
black-faced type in the prose text, and not on the 
margins. This feature meets the objection of many 
people to the use of the Revised Version. If, now, 
this Bible embodied in the text the American Com- 
mittee's preferences, we should be content for the 
time being with this admirable book. 

"The Golden Maiden" (Helman- 
Foik-taie, Taylor Co.) is a collection of Ar- 

of Armenia. . ' . 

meman folk tales written by one who 
is himself an Armenian, Mr. A. G. Seklemian. The 
antiquity of the people, the tenacity with which they 
have kept their ideas and customs, the retention of 
race characteristics, which may be likened to the 
Jewish race-survival, and the fact that the Armenian 
Church is the oldest national Christian Church in the 
world, all lend interest to the study of the country. 
The reader is at once struck by resemblances to the 
folk-lore of other Aryan peoples. Traces of Persian, 
Arabic, and Turkish influence are found, since Ar- 
menia was successively conquered by those nations. 
The book abounds in stories of magic swords and 
rings, treacherous elder brothers, jealous and wicked 
stepmothers, kindly old fairies, and hazardous expe- 
ditions undertaken by disguised princes to rescue 
beautiful captive princesses after killing dragons, 
and giants even to the number of forty. From a 
literary point of view, this collection suffers, of 
course, from comparison with such works as Hans 
Andersen's fairy tales. To be sure, Andersen did not 
gather all his tales from the lips of peasants and make 
a great effort, for scientific purposes, to secure fidelity 
to the original. Many of his stories are conscious 
creations with the element of feeling strong in them 
creations of a man of genius with a deep love for 
humanity and nature. Mr. Seklemian's book is a 
distinct addition to the existing collection of folk- 
lore literature. 

In these times so popular is the 
p ntle ^ of eay.writing!-the 
book of slender, clever, half loitering 
criticism is by no means a rarity, though, very often, 
a pleasant thing to have at hand. Such a book is 
the collection of essays by Mr. Leon H. Vincent, 
entitled "The Bibliotaph and Other People" 
(Hough ton). The subjects chosen are, for the most 



part, literary subjects, but, except in the essay on 
Thomas Hardy and in one on Stevenson's " St. 
Ives," there is no attempt at serious literary criti- 
cism. Seriousness, indeed, is not in any sense a 
leading quality of the book, which is distinguished 
rather by a disposition toward the blither and more 
humorous aspects of life. The author's fancy has 
led him to themes widely different as different, 
for example, as the letters of a poet and the me- 
moirs of a man of science ; but from each he selects 
the same wholesome elements, and the same vein of 
gayety may be observed in all his treatment. Of 
the distinctly critical essays, that on Hardy is the 
more noticeable, showing a complete appreciation of 
the powerful imaginative realism which is Hardy's 
main strength. In his essay on Stevenson, Mr. Vin- 
cent says what anyone is expected to say ; in the 
one on Keats's letters, he says what is expected 
only from the close lovers of that young and manly 
genius. The first three essays the hero of which 
is the Bibliotaph have too much of the air which 
we know as " off-hand," and a humor which is de- 
cidedly too insistent. Their task, however, is diffi- 
cult ; for the portrait they have to paint is that of a 
large, mirthful, and erratic character, much harder 
of delineation than one delicate and subtle. The 
selection from the Bibliotaph's speeches seems un- 
fortunate, but all that he said was doubtless very 
delightful in the hearing.

Hancock's commercial correspondence, as taken

and biographical narrative. Mr. Brown does not 
pretend to call his book a life of Hancock, but merely 
a contribution to such a work, which he hopes may 
ere long be written by another hand. Unlike many 
of our latter-day " Freemanikins," he does not pre- 
sume to dignify with the name of history original 
documents which are but its raw material. Different 
readers will find different food for entertainment and 
instruction in these business letters of a wholesale 
dealer in tar, oyl, pott ash, codd fish, etc. Their quaint 
spelling and phraseology and grammar cannot but 
arrest the attention. Occasional indignant refer- 
ences to the Stamp Act of 1765 bespeak the patriot 
who, with Samuel Adams, enjoyed the distinction 
of being excluded from General Gage's proclama- 
tion of amnesty. The orders for household and fam- 
ily supplies show the comfortable, even luxurious, 
style of living at the Hancock mansion. The nu- 
merous illustrations in the book add no little to its 
value. It is a singular fact that the first signer of the 
Declaration of Independence, the first Governor of 
the State of Massachusetts, and one of her foremost 
patriots, should have been so long neglected by biog- 
raphers, and that even his grave should have been, 
until very recently, without an enduring monument.

The latest To write a book on General Grant 
biographer of which shall have all the human in- 
Generai Grant. terest of that remarkable character, 
preserving all the well-known facts without diminu- 
tion and adding to them from a great store of per- 
sonal gleanings, is no slight nor unworthy achieve- 
ment. This Mr. Hamlin Garland, in his " Life 
and Character of General U. S. Grant " (Doubleday 
& McClure), has done. One fact that Mr. Gar- 
land's vivid succession of pictures brings to mind is 
the possibility of the sword-and-cloak romance with 
an every-day American for hero : Grant, plain and 
simple to a degree, would make such an one, with 
adventures undreamed of by Dumas. Another point 
is, that here was a man who was, above everything, 
staunch and loyal to his friends, his family, and 
his country. And another is that he was a man 
who always held much besides language in reserve. 
There is hardly an interesting phase of Grant in 
either his public or private career, his civic or mili- 
tary life, which is not brought out plainly in this 
work. If, under the circumstances, the biographer 
has fallen in love with the character he has evolved 
from so much study and research, he is little to be 
blamed. 

A popular ^ confusion of methods, or, rather, 
treatment of the attempt to treat in a popular 
manner subjects set apart from popu- 
lar discussion by convention, has made Dr. Woods 
Hutchinson's " Gospel according to Darwin " (The 
Open Court) neither popular nor scientific. It affords 
a proof of the hold which conventionality has obtained 
upon us, to feel a distinct sense of shock at the setting 
forth in everyday phrase of some forbidden topics 
not taken in the least amiss when clad in more 
scholarly phrase. The writer is a thorough- going 
Darwinian with the courage of his convictions, and 
rather to be suspected of an endeavor to stir up the 
feelings of those who cling to an older faith. What 
he says is not novel in substance nor prepossessing 
in form ; but it may do some good in the same way 
that a breaking plough does when the soil is some- 
what too hard for receptivity and subsequent germi- 
nation. 

An essay on a lost art is apt to be 
more curious than interesting, but 
" Our Conversational Circle " (Cen- 
tury Co. ) is an exception to this rule. The author, 
Agnes H. Morton, applies herself, not to the decline 
of true conversation, but to the means of its revival, 
and her suggestions are, in the main, wise and prac- 
tical. She shows very clearly the nature of conversa- 
tion as distinguished from debate and from public 
address, defining it as " the exchange of views with- 
out the spirit of antagonism." The book is quite 
deserving of the graceful praise given it by Mr. 
Mabie's introduction a praise which he sums up 
by saying, " The book ought to be read because it 
brings into clear view a resource which many people 
have lost, and because it shows clearly how that re- 
source may be developed."

The anthology of " Mother-Song and Child-Song," 
edited by Miss Charlotte Brewster Jordan, and pub- 
lished by the Frederick A. Stokes Co., is an acceptable 
compilation made from a great variety of sources. 

" German Romance," in two volumes, being the famil- 
iar translations from Musseus, Tieck, Fouque', Hoffmann, 
and Richter, is the latest issue of the " Centenary " Car- 
lyle, imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The " Monthly Cumulative Book Index," published 
by Messrs. Morris & Wilson, Minneapolis, has become, 
in its December issue, a volume of 237 pages, and gives 
an author, title, and subject index of all the books pub- 
lished in this country since the beginning of last year. 
It is a valuable work for reference, and the subscription 
price is moderate. 

The publishing section of the American Library As- 
sociation issues a series of " annoted catalog [sic] cards 
for books on English history " (also the same matter in 
pamphlet form), prepared by Mr. W. Dawson Johnston. 
The series for 1897 is now ready, and covers twenty- 
five titles. More than twice that number will be included 
in the series for 1898. 

Mr. David Nutt of London has started the publication 
of a series of booklets to contain " Arthurian Romances 
Unrepresented in Malory's ' Morte d' Arthur,' " and the 
first publication of the series gives us " Sir Gawain and 
the Green Knight," turned from Middle English into 
Modern by Miss Jessie L. Weston, who has supplied an 
introduction and notes. 

The valuable series of historical manuals called 
" Events of Our Own Time," imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner, has recently been enlarged by the addition of 
two interesting volumes: "The War in the Peninsula," 
by Mr. Alexander Innes Shand; and "Africa in the 
Nineteenth Century," by Mr. Edgar Sanderson. Maps, 
plans, and copper-plate portraits illustrate these vol- 
umes. 

Two recent additions to the " Athenseum Press " pub- 
lications of Messrs. Ginn & Co. are " The Poems of Will- 
iam Collins," edited by Mr. Walter C. Bronson; and 
" Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon," 
edited by Dr. Oliver F. Emerson. The text of the latter 
volume forms a connected narrative based upon the 
recently published " Autobiographies," and provides a 
critical edition of a kind that has been much needed. It 
should supersede the old " Memoirs " altogether. 

" The Mistakes We Make " (Crowell) is a " practical 
manual of corrections in history, language, and fact, for 
readers and writers," edited with much display of curi- 
ous information, by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole. A some- 
what similar compilation prepared for the English 
market by Mr. C. E. Clark has served as a basis for 
this volume, but Mr. Dole has made so many changes 
and additions that he is entitled to the major share of 
the credit for producing so readable and useful a book. 

Our weekly contemporary " Unity," which has been 
published in Chicago for twenty years, announces an 
enlargement of scope whereby it will in future champion 
the cause of civic integrity in addition to its services in 
behalf of broad religious truth. Mr. William Kent is 
now associated with Mr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones in the 
editorship, a conjunction from which much may be ex-

pected. Mr. Kent has long been a fighter in the good 
cause of upright politics, and is, besides, a direct and 
vigorous writer. 

We reproduce from " The Academy " the following 
sonnet addressed by Professor Dowden to Mr. Sidney 
Lee, " that bestowed upon me a coppie of his Life of 
Shake-speare." 
" Swete Boye, whose name revives dead Astrophell, 

Fame through her goolden trumpe now blows it wide 
With his who, gazing in Conceit's deepe well, 

Saw Life and Death, and Love yew-crown'd, star-eyed. 
O he them too a wrestler with old Time, 

Blunt his dread sickle, scatter his red sand ! 
Let men of Inde in their outlandish ryme 

Rename thee queinte to men of Samarcand ! 
One globe brawn-shouldher'd, broad-hipp'd Herc'les bore ;

And roll reverting stones that aitches breed ?

Who love them not, yet love this frnitfull Lea"

was spent in Philadelphia, where he drew the largest crowds ever seen 
at any band concerts. Concerts were also given in Baltimore, Brooklyn, 
Boston, and all of the principal cities of New England and New York 
State. It has been the most successful year the band ever had, and has 
added much to Mr. Brooke's fame throughout America. The present 
series of concerts in Chicago will be continued every Sunday afternoon 
for about twenty weeks, when the band will again go East for another 
summer in Philadelphia.

different from those of other magazines, and are alone worth more

The Burbaiik series of Color Portraits of celebrated Indians, now 
running (which commenced in the October issue), are of great artistic 
as well as historic interest. The news-stand editions of both October 
and November were exhausted within a few days of publication.

A Weekly Library for Five Cents a Week 

"PUBLIC OPINION," writes an enthusiastic admirer, "is a weekly library 
brought to my own door for five cents a week." " The present," says another, " is 
the busiest of all ages, and compression, condensation, and sifting, the most blessed 
of all services, and these services are rendered by PUBLIC OPINION as by no 
other instrumentality." 

REPRESENTATIVE MEN OF EVERY VOCATION SUBSCRIBE 



It is a busy man's weekly. 

It is the world's progress in a nutshell. 

It is the substance of 3000 periodicals. 

It is a reading-room brought into my study. 

It is a weekly photograph of public sentiment. 

Its readers are auditors of the world's debates. 

It gives every side of every important question. 

It is a time-saver, a talent-saver, a money-saver. 

It is THE IKDISPENS ABLE WEEKLY ; others are luxuries. 

It is the best weekly outlook for professional people. 

It is a weekly record of all that's worth remembering. 

It reflects with fairness every phase of public opinion. 

It is the best weekly exponent of the world's life and 
thought.

If I took no other paper, PUBLIC OPINION would still keep me abreast of the times. 

If I took one hundred periodicals I should still want PUBLIC OPINION. 

When it reaches my table every one of the other twenty papers to which I subscribe must give way to it. 

It is the only single publication issued in the world which keeps its readers fully abreast of the times, week 
by week. 

My wife, too, finds it exactly suited to her odds and ends of time, and so she keeps up with the day. 

A Washington man under date of December 3, writes: 

"1 don't know what I would do without PUBLIC OPINION. If I could not get it otherwise, I 
would dispense with butter on my bread in order to have its weekly visits. I am too busy a 
man to wade through the modern daily papers. In PUBLIC OPINION I get the cream of comment 
without the blue milk of sensation."

THE PORTO RICO OF TO-DAY 

Pages from a Correspondent's Note -Book. 
By ALBERT GARDNER ROBINSON. 

With maps and twenty- four illustrations. 12mo, $1.50. 

In his capacity as a newspaper correspondent Mr. Robinson travelled over the length and breadth of Porto Rico, 
studying the people and their manners and customs, the trade conditions, the agricultural and commercial situation, the 
means of transportation and cummnnication, and other serious problems that await solution. The distinguishing note of 
his book is the clearness and sanity with which this detailed picture of the Porto Rico of to-day is presented. From it one 
can get an admirable idea of the present condition of this new possession of the United States, and of the business prospects 
which it holds out.

The Principles, Methods, History, and Results of its Several Departments and of the Whole. By CHARLES 
A. BRIGGS, D.D. 8vo, $3.00 net. 

Dr. Briggs's new book covers the whole ground of Biblical study ; gives a history of every department, with ample 
illustrations from the new Testament as well as from the Old ; states the results thus far attained, the present problems, 
and the aims for the future. The work takes the place of the author's " Biblical Study," which has been here revised, 
enlarged to double its former size, and entirely reset, so that it is essentially a new book. 

DEMOCRACY 

A Study of Government. By JAMES H. HYSLOP, Ph.D., Professor of Logic and Ethics in Columbia Univer- 
sity. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

The present work is an attack upon Democracy by a native American who does not accept Monarchy as a necessary 
alternative. It is not merely a destructive piece of writing, but is an attempt at a thorough reconstruction of our political 
institutions. The author insists that the issue cannot longer be evaded and squarely attacks democratic institutions as the 
first step in drawing attention to the problem before us ; and he here proposes a substitute or modification of the present 
form of government without favoring a reactionary policy. The work is destined to arouse wide discussion, especially in 
view of the bearing of its arguments upon the new policy of territorial expansion. 

THE KINGDOM 

An Exegetical Study. By GEORGE DANA BOARDMAN, D.D. 8vo, $2.00. 

The purpose of this book is to explain the frequent and profound New Testament formula, " The Kingdom of God "; 
to rescue this formula from radical misconceptions ; to define its nature ; to state its laws ; to describe its method ; to 
unfold its symbols ; to set forth its issue. Its purpose is irenic. Its method is exegetical, the study including substantially 
every important Scripture which contains the phrase, " Kingdom of God."

A SHORT HISTORY OF GERMANY 

By MARY PLATT PARMELE. Each, 16mo, 60 cents net. 

_ The Review of Reviews, speaking of Mrs. Parmele's " Short History of the United States," says : " Its value does not 
lie in the multitude of facts which it contains, but rather in the lucid, natural way in which a few really important facts 
are presented and grouped, and in the stimulus which it imparts to a rational study of our country's history."

Mr. Watson's treatment of history is from a new and entirely modern point of view. The well-known political 
leader says in his Preface that it has been his purpose to lay before his readers " a clear narrative of the gradual 
development of a great people ... to note the varying forms of government, to trace the ancient origins of 
modern laws and customs, to mark the encroachments of absolutism upon popular rights, to describe the long 
continued struggle of the many to throw off the yoke of the few, to emphasize the corrupting influence of the 
union between Church and State; to illustrate once more the blighting effects of superstition, ignorance, blind 
obedience, unjust laws, confiscation under the disguise of unequal taxes, and a systematic plunder year by year of 
the weaker classes by the stronger." The author is in very keen sympathy with the mass of the people, and for 
the first time we have the historical point of view of the laborer and mechanic told in a style that is bold, racy, and 
unconventional. It is a vigorous and democratic presentation of history.

THE REPORT OF THE CHICAGO 
ED UCA TIONAL COMMISSION. 

The public schools of Chicago constitute one 
of the two largest city systems in the United 
States, and, previous to the very recent infusion 
of new methods and progressive ideas into the 
management of the New York schools, the 
Chicago system might fairly claim the place of 
first importance, both for the efficiency of its 
work and for its exemplification of that gener- 
osity of public support given to the cause of 
education which is the highest mark of Amer- 
ican civilization. Recently, the attention of 
the educational world has been focussed more 
sharply than ever upon the Chicago schools, 
owing to a series of incidents connected with 
the appointment of the former president of 
Brown University to the superintendency, and 
to the energetic way in which Dr. Andrews has 
asserted the prerogatives that should rightfully 
attach to the high office which he holds. Dur- 
ing the few months that have passed since his 
tenure began, he has not only impressed a vig- 
orous personality upon the management of the 
schools under his charge, but also, which is still 
more noteworthy, he has gained the suffrages 
of those who were at the outset most strongly 
opposed to his appointment. 

The call of Dr. Andrews to Chicago, for 
which Mayor Harrison was largely responsible, 
must be considered, in one sense at least, as 
but an incident in a far-reaching plan of school 
reorganization conceived by the latter early in 
the term of his executive office. For the pur- 
pose of giving effect to this plan, the Mayor, 
with the authority of the City Council, ap- 
pointed, more than a year ago, an Educational 
Commission of eleven members, headed by 
President Harper of the University of Chicago. 
This Commission was directed to make a thor- 
ough examination of the school system, as well 
as of the statutes under which it is conducted, 
to deliberate, with the aid of the best expert 
opinion anywhere obtainable, upon the changes 
in law and organization made desirable by the 
growth of the city as well as by the progress of 
educational methods and ideals, and to embody 
the conclusions reached in a report which might 
become the basis of future action. The Com- 
mission, consisting of members of the Chicago 



38 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



Board of Education and the Chicago Council, 
of men prominent in affairs and the professions, 
entered with enthusiasm upon the work assigned 
it, invited suggestions from all quarters that 
seemed to promise help, held weekly sessions, 
and sometimes daily sessions, all through the 
year just ended, and has at last published its 
conclusions in a Report of nearly three hundred 
pages addressed to the Mayor and the City 
Council. The result of all this labor is one of 
the most important educational documents ever 
produced ; it cannot fail to attract widespread 
attention and excite deep interest wherever the 
importance of public education is understood. 
It affords a striking example of a necessary 
piece of work done in the right way, and it is 
much to the credit of Mayor Harrison that he 
should have taken the initiative in this com- 
mendable enterprise. We have said more than 
once that of the duties incumbent upon the 
chief executive of a great city those which re- 
late to the conduct of the public schools are 
paramount to all others, and in the present 
case, as perhaps never before in the history of 
Chicago, the importance of these duties seems 
to have been realized. 

Of the Report as a whole, two or three pre- 
liminary general statements should be made. 
In the first place, it does not assume that things 
have been going badly in school affairs up to 
the present time, but rather gives full recogni- 
tion to the efficiency already attained and to 
the self-sacrificing devotion of past and present 
Boards of Education. But it recognizes also 
the fact that both the school law of the State 
and the school machinery of the city have 
become defective by the mere process of be- 
coming outgrown. As is remarked by Dr. 
G. F. James, who has served as Secretary to 
the Commission, and prepared the Report for 
publication, " the city has grown at a rapid 
rate, and in this department, as in some others, 
a plan of administration has been retained 
which, although good for a city of moderate 
size, is entirely inadequate for one of nearly 
two millions." Mayor Harrison gave expres- 
sion to the same thought when he said, in ask- 
ing for authority to create the Commission, that 
" with the continual growth of the city, addi- 
tional burdens keep coming to the door of the 
Board of Education, which is seriously handi- 
capped by having to deal with new conditions 
and difficult developments in the harness of 
antiquated methods." The spirit of the entire 
Report is thus not complainingly critical, for it 
aims far more at construction than at destruc- 



tion, and all those who have heretofore been 
working for the good of the Chicago schools, 
under adverse conditions, will find in it the 
fullest sympathy with what they have done, and 
the most cordial recognition of their disinter- 
ested devotion. 

A reconstruction of the school law of the 
State is essential to the carrying out of the 
recommendations of the Commission, and it has 
been an important part of the work done by that 
body to draft, under competent legal advice, a 
new and comprehensive statute. Since the most 
important of the recommendations made find a 
place in the proposed new legislation, we may as 
well direct attention at once to those pages of the 
Report in which this draft of a law is found. It 
takes the form of " an act to amend " the act 
of 1889 by repealing twelve sections of the 
sixth article, and substituting therefor nineteen 
new sections. Applying only to cities of more 
than one hundred thousand inhabitants, it would 
affect Chicago alone, and afford one more illus- 
tration of the way in which the special legisla- 
tion, denied by the Constitution of Illinois, may 
be had without doing violence to the funda- 
mental law of the State. The most important 
features of the proposed law are : (1) A reduc- 
tion of membership in the Board of Education 
from twenty-one to eleven. (2) The power to 
exercise the right of eminent domain in the ac- 
quisition of land needed for school purposes. 
(3) The duty of establishing several kinds of 
schools not specifically named under preceding 
legislation . (4 ) The creation of a defin ite status 
for the Superintendent, with a tenure of six 
years, a right to participate in the discussions 
of the Board of Education, and full executive 
power (subject only to a two-thirds vote of dis- 
approval) in all educational matters. (5) The 
creation of a similar status, with ample powers, 
for the Business Manager. (6) The creation 
of a Board of Examiners for the purpose of cer- 
tificating eligible candidates for appointment 
and promotion. There are, of course, many 
other provisions, but these six are of prime im- 
portance, and deserve to be thus singled out 
from the rest. It will be evident enough to 
all readers who are in touch with the best edu- 
cational thought of the age that these recom- 
mendations are not merely sound, but that they 
are absolutely necessary for the proper admin- 
istration of a great municipal system of schools. 
We can hardly imagine a serious argument 
directed against any one of them, and no effort 
should be spared to give them the force of law 
at the earliest opportunity. 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

There are, indeed, a few minor points in all 
this suggested legislation that may need modi- 
fication before the final action is taken. This 
fact is realized by the members of the Commis- 
sion, who unite in saying that " the interests 
which are here involved are so weighty and are 
of such supreme import to the community that 
hasty and inconsiderate action in these matters 
is above all to be deprecated. We hope, there- 
fore, that the system of school management 
which is here proposed will be entirely and 
thoroughly reviewed, before any attempt is 
made to embody its provisions in the school 
law." These are counsels of soberness, and, 
while we believe that the proposed law would, 
as a whole, prove inestimably valuable to the 
interests of the public, we are in doubt con- 
cerning the substance of two or three among 
the minor provisions, and concerning the exact 
wording of some of the more significant ones. 
At present we will call attention to but two 
points, of which the first relates to appointment 
upon the Board of Examiners. " To be eligi- 
ble as a special examiner, an applicant must 
possess either a bachelor's degree from a college 
or university, or an equivalent educational 
training, together with at least five years' suc- 
cessful experience in teaching since gradua- 
tion." These qualifications are certainly not 
too high, and possibly are not high enough. 
The required number of years of experience 
might be doubled without doing harm, and a 
great deal more than the amount of education 
represented by the bachelor's degree might 
reasonably be demanded. Our doubt relates to 
the construction of the words " or an equiva- 
lent educational training." They do not seem 
to make sufficiently emphatic the idea that the 
education itself, however got, " is the thing," 
and not the particular way in which the begin- 
nings of it happened to be acquired. The ques- 
tion arises, would Mr. Herbert Spencer, for 
example, who had no " training " in the nar- 
row technical sense, be eligible for appointment 
under this provision ? If he would not, some 
modification of the phrase is obviously called 
for. Our other point relates to the power to 
dismiss teachers, which is given to the Superin- 
tendent. Here is an ambiguity that should be 
cleared away, for the closing section of the pro- 
posed law provides that " nothing herein con- 
tained shall be construed as repealing" the 
Pension Act of 1895. Now, the latter act ex- 
pressly declares that teachers shall not be dis- 
missed " except for cause upon written charges, 
which shall be investigated and determined by 



the said Board of Education, whose action and 
decision in the matter shall be final." This 
would certainly lead to troublesome litigation 
were the new law to contradict the old one as 
is now proposed. Between these two conflicting 
ways of dealing with this difficult question, we 
must decide for the law as it now stands. It 
ought to be difficult to dismiss a teacher. The 
responsibility of appointment is greater than 
is commonly realized, and this fact cannot be 
brought too forcibly home to those upon whom 
the responsibility devolves. Let appointments 
be safe-guarded in every way, by academic and 
physical examinations, by certificates of moral 
character, by probationary periods under reg- 
ular supervision, but let them also, when once 
definitely made, bring with them the same se- 
curity of tenure that is enjoyed by a Federal 
judge. The retention of poor teachers in the 
service is a heavy penalty to pay for laxity in 
the methods of their appointment ; but the 
arbitrary power of dismissal, lodged in the 
hands of any one official, would embody a still 
greater wrong. 

We have said so much about the legislative 
appendix of this Report that we have but little 
space to devote to the elaborate discussions 
which make up its* substance. Not only the 
matters which reappear in the proposed law, 
but many others, are discussed from every point 
of view, and in the most elaborate fashion. The 
Report consists of an introduction, twenty arti- 
cles, and eleven appendices. Most of the articles 
have numerous sections, each of the latter with 
its own thesis, argument, and illustrative mate- 
rial. We would like to dwell at much greater 
length than is at present possible upon this illus- 
trative material. It appears in the form of 
lengthy footnotes, and consists of apposite ex- 
tracts from the best recent educational litera- 
ture, of resolutions sent to the Commission by 
the various professional bodies of the city, and 
of the opinions upon special points, solicited 
for the purpose, of a great number of experts 
in the art pedagogical. There is nothing so 
discouraging as the feeling, which often comes 
over those who are in contact with large edu- 
cational systems, that the most vital thought 
upon the subject seems to produce no visible 
effect upon the machinery. There is so much 
inertia to overcome, and the impact of the force 
seems so inadequate. The right way of doing 
things is pointed out so clearly, as well as so 
frequently, that one almost wearies of reading 
about it ; yet the wrong way continues to be 
practised despite all logic and all enlightened

leadership. It is, then, peculiarly refreshing 
to read an educational document which, like 
the one before us, actually goes to the best 
sources for light and counsel, and seeks to make 
a direct practical application, upon the very 
largest scale, of the ideas thus obtained. It 
gives heart to the educational thinker, making 
him feel that his work may not have been done in 
vain after all, that the empty air, which seemed 
to swallow up his words, has really wafted 
them to a fruitful soil, where they may hope to 
be productive after their kind. Over and over 
again, in reading this Report (and we have 
studied it from the first page to the last), we 
have found both in the argument itself and 
in the passages adduced in support thereof, 
ideas so enlightened, so far in advance of any- 
thing that has heretofore come within the range 
of practical possibilities, so full of promise to 
the toilers in a profession that has often been 
made, through wantonness or mere indiffer- 
ence, far more thankless than was necessary, 
that we have stopped to wonder if it could all 
be real, if in very fact it could be true that 
these things were actually included in a plan 
offered for serious consideration by a body of 
practically-minded men, and under auspices 
that bid fair to bring about its adoption. Upon 
some future occasion we shall probably call 
specific attention to some of these matters, as 
well as point out a few things here and there 
that seem to us mistakes, but we must now be 
content to conclude by saying that the Report 
is one of the strongest educational documents 
that we have ever seen ; as a model of compact 
statement and cogent reasoning it is a product 
of the trained intelligence that cannot fail to 
impress all who examine it, and is sure to exert 
a wide influence upon the administration of 
public education in our great cities. 



THE AMERICAN REJECTION OF POE. 

Accepted authors are like those old estates which 
were held by the annual rent of a rose or a piece of 
fruit : we have nothing to do but to enjoy them and 
pay them a passing tribute of praise. A poet such 
as Poe, however, is like the feudal tenures which 
were retained on condition of service at arms. Every 
new admirer has to fight against the prejudices and 
lingering malignities which obscure and injure his 
chief. Burke complained that with all his services 
to the state he could get no credence or acceptance 
anywhere. At every gate he had to show his pass- 
port. In his own country, at least, Foe's fame is 
continually under arrest, and his friends have always 



to be giving bail for him. Perhaps this demand for 
defense evokes a love and loyalty which are in them- 
selves a reward. 

Why is it that America has always set its face 
against Poe ? What defect was there in his life and 
art, or what deficiency in the American character 
and aesthetic sense, or what incompatibility between 
these factors in the case, to produce such a result? 
That to a great extent he is ignored and repudiated 
is unquestionable. His life has been written and 
his works edited of late in a spirit of cold hostility. 
Volumes of specimen selections of prose or verse 
appear with his work omitted. In those foolish 
lists of American great men which it was the fashion 
recently to cause school-children to memorize, he was 
always left out. Meanwhile, Europe has but one 
opinion in the matter ; and whereas Tennyson is 
domesticated in English-speaking lands, Poe is domi- 
ciled and a dominant force wherever there is a living 
literature. 

Poe never had a good back, such as the New 
England writers obtained, to push him to the front 
and keep him there. He was of the South the 
very incarnation of the South ; and the South has 
always ordered its authors to move on, for fear they 
might die on the parish. The South wreaked itself 
on politics ruined itself by politics and has 
never had the will or desire to stand up for its great- 
est son. The North has always had plenty of plain 
livers and high thinkers who ought to have wel- 
comed the martyr of thought and imagination; but 
something exotic in Poe, which hinted of another 
clime and age, repelled these cold and clannish 
spirits. So, homeless in his life, Poe is still beating 
about like the Flying Dutchman, ever seeking and 
always denied a harbor in his country-people's 
hearts. 

Poe had of course a part in this tragedy of errors 
and misconceptions, but, as I should judge, an 
entirely honorable one. There are three excellent 
ways in which a man can get himself disliked by his 
fellows : he may stand aloof from them, he may 
indulge in the practice of irony, and he may be 
" ever right, Menenius, ever right." Poe was an 
offender in all these respects. He never seems to 
have had an intimate friend anyone who could 
do for him what Hamlet craved of Horatio with his 
dying breath. Somebody said of Calhoun that he 
looked like one who had lost the power of communi- 
cating with his fellow beings. A like spell of isola- 
tion is upon Poe. Wanting in humor, he sometimes 
tried to range his mind with others by the use of 
irony ; or he assumed an air which I suppose he 
thought that of a man of the world, but which is 
quite detestable. He wrote an essay on Diddling as 
an exact science, and people jumped to the conclusion 
that he was Jeremy himself in person. He took a 
grim delight in scenes of horror, and people imag- 
ined he acted them in life. " The Raven " has been 
described as an utterance of remorse. Remorse for 
what ? I have read everything that has been gathered 
about Poe, and I cannot, for my life, imagine him as

anything but a stainless and chivalrous knight. The 
few, trivial, and usually unsubstantiated smutches 
which microscopic industry has found on his armor 
would not show at all against a panoply less pure 
and white. 

I remember reading an anecdote of a lieutenant 
in the British Navy who entertained Byron on his 
ship in the Levant. Byron was proud of his sea- 
manship, and the acute officer would carefully have 
something disarranged in the top hamper of the 
ship before the poet came on deck in the morn- 
ing. When the latter did so, he would cock his eye 
aloft and immediately discover and point out the 
irregularity. The lieutenant would apologize, and 
have it remedied. Byron liked that lieutenant, 
and men in general like those who give them some- 
thing to forgive. Poe, a logic machine, was abso- 
lutely incapable of those pleasing flaws and defi- 
ciencies which allow other people to have a good 
opinion of themselves. He always added up true. 
The tradition is that he was a drunkard. There is 
not evidence enough against him to hang a dog. All 
the testimony actually produced all the witnesses 
who give their names and addresses, people who 
lived with him and knew him best, deny it. That 
he was easily affected by liquor and sometimes over- 
come by it, is possible, and what does it matter ? 
That there was any debauchery is impossible. His 
poverty proves it the amount of work he did 
proves it ; and, most of all, the quality of what he 
wrote, which grew in power and concentration to 
the last. There is more plausibility in the accusa- 
tion of irregularity in money matters. In a life so 
harassed as Foe's, a few ragged debts might easily 
be left. But here again there is nothing definite. 
Nobody has come forward with notes of hand or 
evidences of defalcation. On the contrary, letter 
after letter has come to light showing Foe's scrup- 
ulous exactitude about obligations. Practically, he 
was cheated by almost everyone with whom he came 
in contact and then these, to shield themselves, 
cried after him " Stop thief ! " He built up two or 
three magazines for others, and when, dissatisfied 
with the pittance thrown him, he designed a maga- 
zine of his own, he was laughed at and decried. 
Really, my only grievance against Poe is that he 
was too good. He ought to have taken to the road 
and compelled a just tribute at the point of the 
pistol. 

Foe's principles of criticism are true enough 
within limits, but they are far from being the whole 
truth. His lack of humor, deficient knowledge of 
human nature, and insensibility to that side of great- 
ness which results from mere mass, quite incapaci- 
tated him from criticising the mightiest works of 
literature. But he never attempted such criticism ; 
and for the work he had to do the appreciation 
of our modern English or American masters he 
was almost infallible. And surely no writer has 
ever praised his contemporaries and rivals as he did. 
He seems to have written with no thought of self, 
with a humility almost pathetic. He may be said 



to have discovered Hawthorne, and he crowned him 
king of the short story. His article on Bryant is still 
a just estimate. The innocently imitative quality 
of Longfellow's genius offended him, but he speaks 
of the New England poet otherwise with respect, 
and calls him the leading poet of the day. He 
fairly returned Lowell's praise. His enthusiasm for 
Tennyson was excessive : it was idolatry. He pointed 
out Mrs. Browning's faults, but wrote of her with a 
fervor which no one else has imitated. His eulogy 
of the singularly neglected R. H. Home sets one in 
a glow. This high and generous appreciation of the 
best in contemporary literature was coupled with a 
decided distaste for trash, and, unfortunately, his 
calling as a critic compelled him to deal more with 
trash than with excellence. He wrote his Dunciad, 
and after his death the dunces had their revenge. 

Every one of Foe's greater poems is a distinct 
and original effort. He could not repeat himself. 
In the case of the majority of poets, the style is the 
same throughout or at most they have two or 
three different manners. It would not be difficult, 
for example, to piece together, into a seamless whole, 
portions of separate poems by Wordsworth or Ten- 
nyson. But each one of Foe's is a vital entity 
born once, and not again. He is not, in poetry, one 
of those constellations which spread over half the 
sky, which hold their heads in the zenith while their 
skirts are obscured below the horizon, rather, he 
is a small compact cluster of stars. If we could 
imagine the stars of the Pleiades differently colored 
one red, one yellow, one green, and so forth, 
but each one vividly aflame in its several hue we 
should get a good image of Poe's poetry. He is not, 
like Shelley, a poet of the fourth dimension, yet 
neither is he distinctly sensuous, and he furnishes 
but few copy-book maxims or proverbial phrases. 
Rather in him imagery, diction, music, merge into 
one effect, as fire is a compound of a hundred dif- 
ferent things. His thought, too, does not obtrude 
itself. He has, indeed, what I might call the senti- 
ment of profundity rather than special precision of 
thought. 

Poe's tales seem to me the third collection in 
point of merit in literature the other two being 
the Arabian Nights and Boccaccio. He has not the 
humor of the one nor the human nature of the other ; 
but he surpasses them both in depth and imagina- 
tion, and for originality he is unrivalled anywhere. 
No one else has opened so many paths, burst into- 
so many new regions of romance. Indeed, as one 
sees authors all over the world painfully following 
in his tracks, each one exploring a single region 
which Poe discovered and dismissed in a few pages, 
one feels that he was the compendium of all possible 
literary pioneers and explorers a dozen Colum- 
buses rolled into one. 

There is a small group of Poe's tales, usually 
passed over, which is worth a moment's mention. 
It consists of " The Power of Words," " The Col- 
loquy of Monus and Una," " The Conversation of 
Eiros and Charmion," " Shadow, a Fable," and

[Jan. 16, 



" Silence, a Parable." They are not wanting in a 
certain alloy of De Quinceyism which at times mars 
Foe's style of perfect plainness ; but they are singu- 
larly impressive in thought. They have that man- 
ner or sentiment of profundity which I have spoken 
of, more even than his poems ; and they lead up to 
Poe's final work, " Eureka." 

" Eureka " has, I judge, been less read than any- 
thing else Poe wrote. Certainly it has been little dis- 
cussed. The average critic probably finds it difficult 
to place, and so lets it alone. It is difficult to place. 
It is too scientific for rhapsody too plain for 
mysticism ; and yet it is hardly either science or 
metaphysics. It might be tersely described as the 
ideas of Spinoza in the language of Newton. Poe 
as a thinker resembles those old Greek philosophers 
Pythagoras, Parmenides, or Empedocles who 
chanted in verse their luminous guesses as to the 
origin and constitution of things, without troubling 
themselves as to any analysis of their knowledge. 
Coleridge said of Spinoza that if It rather than I 
was the central fact of existence, Spinoza would be 
right. It and not I was the basis of the Pre-Socratic 
Greek thinkers ; and perhaps our most modern 
philosophy has the same foundation. Schopenhauer's 
substitution of Will for Consciousness as the final 
fact, and the Darwinian theory, both tend that way. 
Without knowing anything of Schopenhauer, and 
anterior to Darwin, Poe's thought also tends that 
way. He has nothing of the mathematical pedantry 
of Spinoza, and of course none of the immense sci- 
entific detail of the evolutionists ; but I do not see 
why his guess is not as good as theirs. In one very 
startling idea he seems to have been anticipated. 
Deducing that the Universe is finite mainly be- 
cause laws cannot be conceived to exist in the 
unlimited he goes on to say there may yet exist 
other worlds and other universes, each in the bosom 
of its own private and peculiar God. Cardinal 
Newman is authority for the statement that Franklin 
used to dally with this idea in conversation. Poe, 
while in Philadelphia, may possibly have heard of 
Franklin's speculation. I can recall nothing like it 
elsewhere. 

I have not space to follow Poe into the other 
spheres of his intellectual activity into his studies 
in Landscape Gardening and Household Decoration, 
on Versification and the Philosophy of Composition, 
and much else. Poe, in my judgment, was the great- 
est intellect America has produced assuredly the 
best artist. He reminds me of a sower stalking down 
a furrow and scattering broadcast seed which a mul- 
titude of crows attendant upon him appropriate to 
their own use and behoof without a single croak of 
thanks. In a crude new world, a spirit was born to 
whom even the old world, where time has mellowed 
and enriched men's lives by layer on layer of myth 
and metaphysic, drift after drift of legend and his- 
tory, decay above decay of citadels and cities and 
empires, to whom even this soil and surrounding 
would have seemed harsh and strange. The crude 
new world could make nothing of this spirit, except 



that it was not worth while to waste good provisions 
on such an uninvited guest, and that it was best to 
huddle him into his grave with lies. But enough ! 
The little that Poe got is gone. The much that he 
gave remains a glory forever.

THE VIRGINIA MEETING OF 
THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION. 



The most important feature of the sixteenth annual 
meeting of the Modern Language Association of Amer- 
ica, which was held December 27, 28, and 29, in the 
buildings of the University of Virginia, at Charlottes- 
ville, was the announcement of the completion of the 
Report of the Committee of Twelve, which had been 
appointed two years ago at the meeting held in Cleve- 
land. As stated in the resolution creating the Com- 
mittee, the object was, " (a) to consider the position of 
the Modern Languages French and German in 
Secondary Education; (ft) to examine into and make 
recommendations upon methods of instruction, the train- 
ing of teachers, and such other questions connected with 
the teaching of the Modern Languages in the Secondary 
Schools and the Colleges as in the judgment of the 
Committee may require consideration." The personnel 
of the Committee was as follows: Prof. Calvin Thomas, 
Columbia University, Chairman; E. H. Babbitt, Secre- 
tary; B. L. Bowen, H. C. G. Brandt, W. H. Carruth, 
S. W. Cutting, A. M. Elliott, C. H. Grandgent, G. A. 
Hench, H. A. Rennert, W. B. Snow, and B. W. Wells. 

The Report is about twenty-five thousand words in 
length, and its presentation in full was therefore impos- 
sible. Professor Thomas gave a summary, which showed 
the thoroughness with which every phase of the subject 
had been studied, and indicated conclusively that the 
document must be considered as final and decisive for 
many of the points investigated. The historical part 
of the paper is of very great interest, while the con- 
structive value of the suggestions will depend upon 
their general adoption. The Report has been asked 
for by the United States Bureau of Education, and will 
doubtless be published in the series of educational pub- 
lications. It will be finally acted upon by the Associa- 
tion at its next annual meeting. 

The attendance at the meeting was in round numbers 
one hundred, which must be regarded as a large repre- 
sentation. The various Eastern universities and colleges 
all sent good delegations. Harvard had an unusually 
strong representation, while Johns Hopkins, Yale, and 
Columbia contributed materially to the success of the 
meeting. As was to be expected, the Southern colleges 
were also represented in large numbers. 

The great number of papers read made it necessary 
to limit each speaker to twenty minutes. This was felt 
to be a hardship by some of the delegates, but most of 
those who came with papers had reduced their studies 
to the form of abstracts or presented merely a part of 
their investigations. To these the shortness of the time 
allowed was in no sense an inconvenience. An unusual 
number of the papers had more than special interest, 
and there can be observed from year to year a distinct 
effort to select topics which will be of value to the larger 
body of the delegates present. Until this effort is con- 
sistently carried out, the reading of the essays will not 
attract the attention that they in most cases merit.

An invitation from the Central Association to hold a

The election of Professor H. C. G. von Jagemann, 
one of the founders of the Association, to the Presidency 
for next year was generally regarded as peculiarly ap- 
propriate. The other changes in officers included merely 
the substitution of Messrs. L. E. Menger, H. S. White, 
and W. D. Toy, for Messrs. C. T. Winchester, Bliss 
Perry, and A. R. Hohlfeld, on the Executive Council. 

The social arrangements, which were in the hands of 
the local committee, Professors Charles W. Kent, James 
A. Harrison, and Paul B. Barringer, included two very 
handsome receptions, a luncheon, and an excursion to 
the home of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. The gen- 
uine Southern hospitality accorded on all hands to the 
members contributed greatly to the success of one of 
the best meetings ever held by the Association.

THE NEBRASKA MEETING OF THE 

CENTRAL MODERN LANGUAGE 

ASSOCIATION. 

The fourth annual meeting of the Central Division 
of the Modern Language Association of America was 
held December 27, 28, and 29, in the library building 
of the University of Nebraska, at Lincoln. There was 
a relatively small attendance, as was to be expected at 
a meeting held so far to one side of the district, yet 
there was a representation of many states and of all the 
departments interested. Moreover, there was some gain 
in the way of closer contact and greater freedom of 
intercourse and discussion, due perhaps to the smaller 
circle. Doubtless one element in determining the choice 
of Lincoln as a meeting-place was the presence of that 
veteran scholar, Professor Edgren, and his participation 
was a powerful attraction of the sessions. 

In addition to the address by the President, Professor 
C. Alphonso Smith, of the University of Louisiana, on 
" The Work of the Modern Language Association," the 
following papers were read : " Certain Peculiarities of 
the Structure of the I-Novel," by Miss Katherine Mer- 
rill, of Austin, 111. ; " The Root-changing Verbs in Span- 
ish " and " Historical Dictionaries," by Professor A. H. 
Edgren, of the University of Nebraska; "Leonard Cox 
and the First English Rhetoric," by Dr. F. I. Carpenter, 
of the University of Chicago; "Tense Limitations of 
the Modal Auxiliaries in German," by Professor W. H. 
Carruth, of the University of Kansas; " The Poetic 
Value of Long Words," by Professor A. H. Tolman, of 
the University of Chicago; " The Origin of Some Ideas 
of Sense-perception," by Professor E. A. Wood, of Cor- 
nell College, Iowa; "Dramatic Renaissance," by Miss 
Anstice Harris, of Rockford College, 111. ; " A Method 
of Teaching Metrics," by Mr. Edward P. Morton, of the 
University of Indiana; " Wilhelm Miiller and the Ital- 
ian Folksong," by Dr. Philip S. Allen, of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago; " Le Covenant Vivien," by Professor 
Raymond Weeks, of the University of Missouri; "Anglo- 
Saxon Readers," by Miss Louise Pound, of the Univer- 
sity of Nebraska; "Poe's Critique of Hawthorne," by 
Dr. H. M. Belden, of the University of Missouri; and 
" The Concord of Collectives," by Professor C. Alphonso 



Smith, of the University of Louisiana. Several other 
papers that were announced did not arrive in time to 
be presented, or were read by title. In addition to these 
papers, Professor Starr W. Cutting, of the University 
of Chicago, on behalf of the Committee of Twelve, pre- 
sented its report on Entrance Requirements in Modern 
Languages. This is a committee of the whole Associa- 
tion, which has been working for two years on the sub- 
ject named, and the report, which is to be printed by 
the National Bureau of Education, will probably go far 
toward establishing approximate standards in modern 
language teaching, while tending to improve the quality 
of the work done as well as of the ideals for the future. 
It would be impossible in the space of such a notice 
as this even to mark the striking features of the many 
interesting papers read. Besides the scholarly and 
charming address of the President, some of the papers 
that aroused particular interest and discussion were 
those by Miss Merrill, Mr. Morton, Dr. Allen, and Dr. 
Carpenter. President Smith and Secretary Schmidt- 
Wartenberg were reflected. Receptions were given to 
the members of the Association by Professor Edgren, 
and by the University Club. w H CARRUTH-

BOOK DISTRIBUTION: A SUGGESTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your editorial of January 1 on the Distribution of 
Books reminds me of a letter which I had in my hands 
a year or two ago, in which Mr. Caleb Atwater gave a 
contemporaneous account of his method of disposing of 
his " History of Ohio." He simply loaded the edition 
into a wagon, took the lines into his own hands, and 
drove up and down the settled portions of the state dis- 
posing of copies wherever he could find a buyer, as any 
honest farmer might dispose of his surplus cabbages. 
There was no furnishing of innumerable copies to hun- 
gry reviewers, no tribute to the newspapers for adver- 
tising, no division of income with the middle-man in 
any shape or form. 

Now here is a bonanza for some literary celebrity who 
is bold enough to embrace it. Imagine Mr. Marion 
Crawford drawing up to your door in a Roman chariot 
with a supply of " Ave Roma Immortalis," or Mr. 
Manilla Garland in an ox-cart with his newest illustra- 
tion of Western freshness and unconventionality in lit- 
erature, or Mr. Lafcadio Hearn in a jinrikisba with a lap 
full of his latest Japanese studies, or Colonel Roosevelt 
dashing up on a mustang with a knapsack full of his 
forthcoming " Rough Riders " and a commissary wagon 
with the rest of the edition following behind ! Who 
could resist the temptation to buy, especially when the 
distinguished author could without any extra charge put 
his autograph on the fly-leaf while you were fumbling 
in your pockets for the money ? We have been told 
again and again that the production of literature is a 
business and should be conducted on business principles, 
and we have seen a growing tendency to adopt any 
method of securing a market which has proved success- 
ful in other lines of business: now here is something 
which will be an attractive novelty to a novelty-loving 
generation, let us see who will be the first to start.

UNEXPLORED ASIA.* 



The appetite of the public, which has been 
whetted for Dr. Hedin's book, "Through Asia," 
by some preliminary tid-bits, can now judge of 
the feast as a whole. Certainly we find here an 
interesting record of very large achievements, 
perhaps we might say unique achievements, 
in exploration. By quite primitive means of 
travel, Dr. Hedin, between 1893 and 1897, 
covered more than 6500 miles of rough and 
desert country, and over 2000 miles of this 
was through regions wholly unexplored, while 
the rest was only very partially known through 
one, two, or at the most three predecessors. 

The field of Dr. Hedin's very remarkable 
exploits was the largest unknown territory on 
the globe. We know more of Central Africa, 
perhaps even of Central South America, than 
of the vast central plateau of Asia, called the 
Pamirs, and of the great mountain systems 
radiating thence, the Hindu-Kush, Kwen-Lun, 
Kara-Korum, and Himalayas. In these stu- 
pendous solitudes, in the immense weird wastes 
of this " Roof of the World," amidst awful 
scenery, more lunar than terrestrial, Dr. Hedin, 
alone save for a few native guides, journeyed 
for months and years, observing, measuring, 
and mapping, with unfaltering scientific enthu- 
siasm. 

The most salient episode in these volumes is 
undoubtedly Dr. Hedin's account of his well- 
nigh disastrous trip across a portion of the 
Gobi Desert. Lost in the desert, he records 
in his diary, April 30, 1895 : 

" Rested on a bigh dune, where the camels gave up. 
We scanned the eastern horizon with a field-glass 
nothing but mountains of sand in every direction ; not a 
blade of vegetation, not a sign of life. Nothing heard 
of Yollehi, either in the evening or during the night. 
My men maintained he had gone back to the stores we 
had left behind, intending to keep himself alive on the 
tinned provisions, while he fetched help to carry off the 
rest. Islam believed he was dead. There were still a 
few drops of water left from the morning, about a tum- 
blerful in all. Half of this was used in moistening the 
men's lips. The little that remained was to be divided 
equally between us all in the evening. But when even- 
ing came we discovered that Kasim and Mohammed 
Shah, who led the caravan, had stolen every drop! We 
were all terribly weak, men as well as camels. God 
help us all!" 

The days immediately succeeding were ter- 
rible days, most of his men and animals per-

ishing with thirst. At length, on May 5, his 
faithful companion Kasim failed him, and he 
crawled and hobbled painfully through a forest 
to the dry bed of the Khotan-daria River. 
However, after searching he found a pool in a 
thicket. 

" It would be in vain for me to try to describe the 
feelings which now overpowered me. They may be 
imagined; they cannot be described. Before drinking 
I counted my pulse: it was forty-nine. Then I took 
the tin box out of my pocket, filled it, and drank. How 
sweet that water tasted! Nobody can conceive it who 
has not been within an ace of dying of thirst. I lifted 
the tin to my lips, calmly, slowly, deliberately, and 
drank, drank, drank, time after time. How delicious! 
What exquisite pleasure ! The noblest wine ever pressed 
out of the grape, the divinest nectar ever made, was 
never half so sweet. My hopes had not deceived me. 
The star of my fortunes shone brightly as ever it did. 
I do not think that I at all exaggerate if I say that dur- 
ing the first ten minutes I drank between five and six 
pints. The tin box held not quite an ordinary tumbler- 
ful, and I emptied it quite a score of times. At that 
moment it never entered my head that, after such a long 
fast, it might be dangerous to drink in such a quantity. 
But I experienced not the slightest ill effects from it. 
On the contrary, I felt that cold, clear, delicious water 
infused new energy into me. Every blood-vessel and 
tissue of my body sucked up the life-giving liquid like 
a sponge. My pulse, which had been so feeble, now 
beat strong again. At the end of a few minutes it was 
already fifty-six. My blood, which had lately been so 
sluggish and so slow that it was scarce able to creep 
through the capillaries, now coursed easily through every 
blood-vessel. My hands, which had been dry, parched, 
and hard as wood, swelled out again. My skin, which 
had been like parchment, turned moist and elastic. And 
soon afterwards an active prespiration broke out upon 
my brow. In a word, I felt my whole body was imbib- 
ing fresh life and fresh strength. It was a solemn and 
awe-inspiring moment." 

Dr. Hedin then filled his water-proof boots 
with the water, and went back for Kasim, but 
did not find him till the following morning. 

" When I came to Kasim, he was lying in the same 
position in which I left him. He glared at me with the 
wild, startled eyes of a faun; but upon recognizing me, 
made an effort, and crept a yard or two nearer, gasping 
out, ' I am dying.' ' Would you like some water ? ' I 
asked, quite calmly. He merely shook his head, and 
collapsed again. He had no conception of what was in 
the boots. I placed one of the boots near him, and 
shook it so that he might hear the splashing of the 
water. He started, uttered an inarticulate cry; and 
when I put the boot to his lips, he emptied it at one 
draught without once stopping; and the next moment he 
emptied the second." 

Having revived Kasim and started him toward 
the pool, Dr. Hedin set out to find assistance, 
and proceeded along the river bed for more 
than two days, subsisting on grass, reeds, and 
frogs, and drinking from occasional pools, till 
he fell in with some shepherds, and at length

recovered Kasim and a second companion 
Islam Bai, and one camel with its load. 

Another salient episode is the account of the 
discovery of buried cities in the Gobi desert. 
Of these cities other travellers have reported 
rumors, but Dr. Hedin is, we believe, the first 
traveller to find and explore them. He found 
a portion of the desert which contained dead 
forests, dead rivers, their beds filled with sand, 
and dead and buried cities. A flourishing re- 
gion had been engulfed by the ever-shifting 
sands. Of the first city he says : 

" This city of Takla-raakan, for that is the name my 
guides gave to it we will retain the name, for it is 
instinct with a wealth of mysterious secrets, of puzzling 
problems, which it is reserved for future inquiry to 
solve this city, of whose existence no European had 
hitherto any inkling, was one of the most unexpected 
discoveries that I made throughout the whole of my 
travel in Asia. Who could have imagined that in the 
interior of the dread Desert of Gobi, and precisely in 
that part of it which in dreariness and desolation ex- 
ceeds all other deserts on the face of the earth, actual 
cities slumbered under the sand, cities wind-driven for 
thousands of years, the ruined survivals of a once flour- 
ishing civilization ? And yet there stood I amid the 
wreck and devastation of an ancient people, within 
whose dwellings none had entered save the sandstorm 
in its days of maddest revelry; there stood I like the 
Prince in the enchanted wood, having awakened to new 
life the city which had slumbered for a thousand years, 
or at any rate rescued the memory of its existence from 
oblivion." 

He gives reasons, from the remains found, for 
thinking that this city dates back perhaps 1500 
years and was the work of Buddhistic Aryans. 
Further on in the desert another city was found. 
The party continued on the way to the north 
across the desert, and fell in with numbers of 
wild camels, which, however, Dr. Hedin thinks 
are descended from tame animals. He crossed 
the desert successfully, reaching the Tarim 
River, and explored in the region of the Lop- 
nor Lakes. In one marshy place he notes that 
the reeds were 

" As tightly packed together as the palings in a wooden 
palisade. In some places they were indeed so densely 
matted together, and so strong, that we actually walked 
along the top of the tangled mat they made, without 
for a single instant being reminded that there was ten 
feet of water immediately under our feet." 

Shortly after this expedition he made his final 
trip, going through unexplored Northern Tibet 
and Tsaidam to China. In this high barren 
plateau region he travelled for two months with- 
out seeing men, and even animals were rather 
rare. He describes quite fully the wild asses 
and wild yaks. The latter he pictures as the 
Royal monarch of the desolate wilds of Tibet an 
animal which excites our admiration not only in virtue 



of its imposing appearance, but also because it alone of 
living creatures is able to defy the loftiest altitudes, the 
bitterest cold, the most violent snow-storms and hail- 
storms which occur in any part of the earth. To all 
these things the wild yak is indifferent. He seems 
rather to enjoy it when the hail pelts down upon his 
back; and when the snows envelope him in their blind- 
ing whirl he goes on quietly grazing as though nothing 
were the matter. The only extremity of climate which 
seems to disturb his equanimity is the summer sunshine. 
When it gets too warm for him he takes a bath in the 
nearest stream, climbs up the mountains to the cool ex- 
panses of the snow-fields and the curving hollows of the 
glaciers, where he finds an especial pleasure in rolling 
himself, and lying down to rest in the powdery snows 
of the neves" 

In this Dr. Hedin rather forgets the musk-ox, 
which has similar habits. 

We could wish that Dr. Hedin had given a 
fuller account of the natives of the various 
countries he visited ; but his notices of them are 
mainly incidental. He throws, however, some 
light on the Kirghiz of the Pamirs, and on the 
shepherds, hunters, and fishermen of the Tarim 
Basin, and we have some interesting and even 
amusing accounts of the Chinese in Turke- 
stan. He thus describes a Chinese dinner at 
Kashgar : 

" I recollect something about an ancient Greek deity 
who swallowed his own offspring. I have read in Persian 
legend about the giant Zohak, who devoured two men's 
brains every day at a meal ! I have heard rumors of 
certain African savages who invite missionaries to din- 
ner and give their guests the place of honor inside the 
pot. I have been set agape by stories of monstrous big 
eaters, who at a single meal could dispose of broken 
ale-bottles, open pen-knives, and old boots. But where 
are all these things as compared with a Chinese dinner 
of state, with its six-and-forty courses, embracing the 
most extraordinary products of the animal and vegetable 
worlds it is possible to imagine? For one thing, to 
mention no more, you need to be blessed with an extra- 
ordinarily fine appetite or else be a Chinaman to 
appreciate smoked ham dripping with molasses. . . . 
On one of the walls there were painted two or three 
black flourishes. I enquired what they signified, and 
was told that they meant, ' Drink and tell racy stories.' 
There was no need for any such admonition, for the 
spirit which reigned over the company was so hilarious, 
and we transgressed so wantonly against the strict rules 
of Chinese etiquette, that the Dao Tai and his compa- 
triots must surely have blushed for us a score of times 
had not their skins been from infancy as yellow as sun- 
dried haddocks." 

As to the accessories and manufacture of 
these volumes, we have a word of criticism. 
The many illustrations from photographs and 
sketches are fairly good, and the maps are ex- 
cellent. The map of the route is divided into 
two parts, one being appended to each volume ; 
but it would have served the reader much better 
to have had one large map of the whole in a

pocket. The volumes are bulky and heavy, 
and the paper so highly glazed as to be un- 
pleasant and even painful to the eye. We wish 
our American publishers could take lessons 
from the English in these regards, say from 
Bentley, whose books are both easy to the hand 
and a delight to the eye. 

As to the matter, the main defect of this 
work of 1200 pages is, strange to say, its undue 
brevity. The author evidently has abundance 
of material for a half-dozen such books, and, 
in the effort to cover the ground in one, the 
work suffers greatly from compression. A 
sketchy summary takes us along too fast. We 
do not want to ride at sixty miles an hour 
through charming scenery. Besides, in his 
endeavor to address both scientists and the 
general public, Dr. Hedin fails to satisfy either 
fully. If he could have devoted one volume 
to his journeys in the Gobi Desert, written up 
on the same detailed scale as that used to de- 
scribe his narrow escape from death on his first 
journey, and if he had given a second volume 
to a scientific summary of all his travels, it 
might have been an improvement. However, 
Dr. Hedin has certainly shown that he is one 
of the most remarkable explorers of this cen- 
tury, and this book is much the most important 
work on Central Asia that has appeared of 
recent years, and so deserves the attention of 
the specialist and the general reader alike.

MR. LESLIE STEPHEN'S STUDIES OF A 
BIOGRAPHER.* 



Mr. Leslie Stephen always amply repays us 
for time spent in his perusal, and this is emi- 
nently true of. his latest work, a collection, in 
two handsome volumes, of recent essays and 
occasional addresses which have in most cases 
already appeared in different periodicals. The 
contents embrace a range of subjects as wide 
apart as the causes of Scott's financial ruin and 
the history of the English newspaper, and a 
space of time bounded by Pascal and Tennyson. 

The introductory essay, entitled " National 
Biography," suggests Mr. Stephen's editorship 
of " The Dictionary of National Biography," 
which contains the fruits of so many years of 
his literary activity. The author starts out by 
quoting a contemptuous remark of Cowper on 

* STUDIES OF A BIOGRAPHER. By Leslie Stephen. In two 
volumes. New York : Q. P. Putnam's Sons. 



the " Biographia Britannica," the forerunner 
of the " Dictionary," that it was 

" A fond attempt to give a deathless lot 
To names ignoble, born to be forgot." 

With reference to his own labors in increasing 
the length of this long procession of the hope- 
lessly insignificant, Mr. Stephen first looks at 
the matter from the point of view of a certain 
Simon Browne, a Non-conformist divine of the 
last century, who had received a terrible shock 
of such a nature that his mind became affected. 
" He fancied that his ' spiritual substance ' had 
been annihilated ; he was a mere empty shell, 
a body without a soul." Under these distress- 
ing circumstances he turned to an employment 
which did not require a soul : he became a dic- 
tionary-maker ! The author then proceeds to 
justify his own dictionary-making in a delight- 
ful essay, which might very well be the preface 
to the " Dictionary of National Biography." 
The sound sense is spiced with biographical 
lore, which no soulless dictionary-maker of the 
Browne variety could ever have amassed. 

The study entitled " John Byrom " is a prac- 
tical illustration of Mr. Stephen's belief in & 
justification of rescuing pastworthies from ob- 
livion. Every reader will thank him heartily 
for reviving the memory of a man who, to his 
long-forgotten merits, has added the new one of 
calling forth a most enjoyable essay from one 
of the best of living prose writers. The reader 
also learns, if he did not already know (as 
probably he did not), who was the author of 
" tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee." 

" Johnsoniana " is primarily a review of the 
" Johnsonian Miscellanies," the concluding vol- 
ume of Dr. Birkbeck Hill's great work on the 
life of Dr. Johnson ; secondarily, although first 
in point of interest, it is a resume of Johnson- 
ian anecdotes not to be found in Boswell's Life. 
Mr. Stephen has brought together most inter- 
esting extracts from Miss Reynolds, who em- 
phasizes the " asperous " side of her brother's 
friend, from Mrs. Piozzi, Madame D'Arblay, 
and other lesser lights of the Johnsonian circle. 
In a few keen sentences the author analyzes the 
genius which made a vain little toady the most 
celebrated of modern biographers. The essay 
is a valuable supplement to the author's own 
" Life of Johnson." 

Two of the articles are valuable as sources 
of information. " The Evolution of Editors " 
traces the history of the English newspaper 
from its feeble beginnings in Grub Street, when 
the editor was both publisher and contributor, 
to its present position of power. " The Impor-

tation of German " is a brief account of the intro- 
duction of the German language and literature 
into England. It suggests a similar history of 
the importation of German into America. 

The study of Matthew Arnold, originally 
delivered as an address before an academic 
body, is full of interest as coming from a man 
of an entirely different intellectual type. Mr. 
Stephen insists, with frequent repetition, that 
he is himself a good Philistine, that he certainly 
would have been pronounced such by Arnold. 
This is, of course, a pardonable bit of self- 
banter that we do not take seriously ; but the 
lack of intellectual sympathy is unmistakable. 
As the author himself puts it, it is the funda- 
mental difference between the poetic and the 
prosaic, or, as we would say, scientific mind. 
While expressing the highest esteem for Ar- 
nold, whom he knew personally, Mr. Stephen 
cannot help regarding him as the " over-fastid- 
ious don," and must have his little fling at 
" intellectual coxcombry and dandyism." His 
contempt for that great " movement " which 
was so potent a factor in Arnold's development, 
he does not conceal. Nevertheless, he renders 
full justice to Arnold's powers as poet and 
critic, and freely acknowledges his services as 
the prophet of culture. Mr. Stephen's criti- 
cism of Arnold's criticism is keen and search- 
ing. Arnold's strength as a critic was also his 
weakness. He was " too much inclined to trust 
to his intuitions, as if they were equivalent to 
scientific and measurable statements." Instead 
of scientific analysis, we are told, Arnold's pro- 
cess was to fix a certain aspect of things by an 
appropriate phrase, thus substituting one set 
of prejudices for another. These " appropriate 
phrases " are repeated to weariness, " with a 
certain air of laying down a genuine scientific 
distinction as clear-cut and unequivocal as a 
chemist's analysis." Arnold's merits as a critic 
are thus summed up : 

" His criticism is anything but final, but it is to be 
taken into account by every man who believes in the 
importance of really civilising the coming world. How 
the huge all-devouring monster which we call Democ- 
racy is to be dealt with, how he is to be coaxed or lec- 
tured or preached into taking as large a dose as possible 
of culture, is really one of the most pressing of prob- 
lems. Some look on with despair, doubting only by 
whatever particular process we shall be crushed into a 
dead level of monotonous mediocrity. I do not suppose 
that Arnold or anyone else could give any solution of 
the great problems; what he could do, and did, I think 
more effectually than anyone, was to wake us out of our 
dull complacency to help to break through the solid 
crust, whatever seeds may be sown by other hands." 

Mr. Stephen has naturally little or no sym- 



pathy with Arnold's criticism of religion. As a 
member of the " prosaic class of mankind," he 
does not think that Arnold has solved the great 
problem by relegating religion to the sphere of 
poetry. The prosaic mind (and the majority 
of mankind are prosaic) requires plain state- 
ments of facts as well as poetic statements of 
moral ideals. Arnold's mode of treating great 
problems is too " airy and bewildering " for 
Mr. Stephen's acceptance ; the poet has got the 
upper hand of the critic. Whether the reader 
will agree with this estimate of the great apostle 
of culture, will depend a good deal on his hav- 
ing the prosaic or the poetic temperament. But 
whatever his personal attitude to Arnold, he 
will feel the sincerity of Mr. Stephen's con- 
cluding remark : 

" Putting on a mask, sometimes of levity, sometimes 
of mere literary dandyism, with an irony which some- 
times is a little too elaborate, but which often expresses 
the keenest intelligence trying to pass itself off as sim- 
plicity, he was a skirmisher, but a skirmisher who did 
more than most heavily-armed warriors, against the vast 
oppressive reign of stupidity and prejudice." 

The essay on Tennyson is another brilliant 
piece of criticism. Mr. Stephen is not an un- 
qualified admirer of the late Laureate, or, as 
he himself puts it, " not quite of the inner circle 
of true worshippers." He cannot call him a 
vates. His own type of mind prevents this, his 
intellectual dissent from Tennyson being as 
marked as in the case of Arnold. He does not 
like Tennyson's philosophy ; in his judgment 
the poet "is always haunted by the fear of 
depriving your sister of her ' happy views,' and 
praises a philosopher for keeping his doubts to 
himself." 

" Tennyson, even in the In Memoriam, always seems 
to me to be like a man clinging to a spar left floating 
after a shipwreck, knowing that it will not support him, 
and yet never able to make up his mind to strike out 
and take his chance of sinking. That may be infinitely 
affecting, but it is not the attitude of the poet who can 
give a war-cry to his followers, or of the philosopher 
who really dares to ' face the spectres of the mind.' " 

Those who have read Mr. Stephen's essay 
entitled " An Apology for Plainspeaking " will 
understand this criticism more fully. In 
Matthew Arnold's phrase, it is the judgment of 
incompatibility, and but few would be willing 
to accept it as a final word on Tennyson. u The 
judgment of gratitude and sympathy " and that 
of conscientious incompatibility must supple- 
ment and rectify each other. The ardent Tenny- 
sonian will resent an estimate of the Laureate 
which excludes him from the rank of the " great 
sage poets," but can hardly refuse to accept the 
explanation of Tennyson's extraordinary popu-

larity as owing to the fact that " he could ex-

Mere mention must suffice for the remaining

cording to the reader's interest in the subject. 
" Jowett's Life," " Oliver Wendell Holmes," 
" The Story of Scott's Euin," " Pascal," " Gib-

" Wordsworth," in addition to those particu-

CHINA IN HISTORY AND IN FACT.* 

Now that the ancient empire of the Middle 
Kingdom seems to be crumbling in decay, a 
History of China which bears evidence of con- 
scientious study and a judicial habit of mind 
deserves a cordial welcome. Such appears to 
be the character of the work which Mr. Boul- 
ger reissues after a thorough revision. The 
narrative is well sustained, the style lucid, and 
the author has done what he could to relieve 
from dulness a work constructed upon the lines 
which the scope of this history required. 

The sources of all ancient history lie in the 
realms of myths and mystery ; and we cannot 
expect Chinese history to be an exception. It 
is a comfort to learn that we may go back so 
far before we strike the debatable border-land. 
The first ruler of China who seems to have se- 
cured for his nation a position of influence was 
one Hwangti, who lived 2637-2577 B. C. It 
is said of him that he subdued his enemies, 
built roads for traffic and ships for commerce, 
revised the calendar, regulated weights, meas- 
ures, and provinces upon a decimal system, and 
that to his inspirations and aspirations much 
of the subsequent glory of China may be attrib- 
uted. There is also mention of an earlier Em- 
peror, Fohi, whose date was 2950 B. C., and 
whose authenticity was approved by Confucius. 

These dates take us at a bound beyond most 
of the periods whose history we are accustomed 
to consider ancient. They reach beyond the 
founding of Rome, the siege of Troy, the sheik- 
ship of Abraham, five hundred years beyond 
Sargon of Babylon, to the time of Amenemhat

of Egypt, when Thebes was in her glory. From 
the reign of Hwangti until this day the sceptre 
has not departed from China. For more than 
four and a half millenniums, the Middle King- 
dom has been governed by a continuous suc- 
cession of rulers, numbering nearly two hun- 
dred and sixty princes belonging to twenty- 
eight dynasties. Other than Chinamen have 
sat upon the throne, including Tartars, Mon- 
gols, and Manchus ; but the ruler of China has 
always been within China. She was never the 
vassal of a government seated in a foreign land. 

The position of China is, and has always 
been, geographically unique. She has occupied 
the broad area of southeastern Asia, a country 
well watered and fertile, diversified in aspect, 
climate, soil, and productions, unrivalled in 
its capacity to support a teeming population. 
Northwardly this country extended to arctic 
Siberia, inhabited by nomadic and untutored 
tribes ; east and south lay the oriental seas, 
which until the fifteenth century were never fur- 
rowed by an occidental keel ; to the southwest 
were a few disunited peoples with no cohesion 
to make them formidable ; while along the 
western borders lay the vast mountain ranges of 
the Himalayah and the Karakorum, the " roof 
of the world," which no western horde ever 
traversed, and none from the east ever passed 
save when Genghis Khan led his victorious 
Mongols beyond the remotest borders of the 
Caspian and the Euxine seas, to the conquest 
of Russia, Hungary, and Poland. 

China was thus enclosed within a large but 
limited area, and this area she usually domin- 
ated. Her quarrels were with the neighbors who 
dwelt with her within these natural boundaries. 
Otherwise she had no commerce nor contact with 
the nations of the world. Children who grow 
up in isolation lack a certain sturdy discipline 
gained in conflicts with other children. It is 
not strange that China should come to estimate 
at more than its true value her culture, her 
prowess, and her right of empire. Until the 
earlier years of the seventeeth century the lit- 
terati of China had not learned that the round 
world had another side, where dwelt people 
both strong and learned. Still less did they 
imagine that such people would come to chal- 
lenge their authority or to disturb the internal 
economy of their empire. 

During twenty-seven of her twenty-eight dy- 
nasties, China was self-contained. Her political 
history, which is all that Mr. Boulger attempts 
to give, is merely an account of the rise and 
demise of families and princes. Kingti sue-

ceeded Wenti and was succeeded by Vouti. 
Some rulers were good, some bad, some worse. 
The only parallel is the Book of the Chronicles 
of the Kings of Israel. No one can realize the 
utter nakedness of history sitting in the rattling 
panoply of her bones, so fully as when he fol- 
lows this procession of two hundred and fifty 
kings in their weary march through five hun- 
dred octavo pages. There is little sign of flesh 
and blood, of the humanity that lived and loved 
or hated and suffered in those ancient days. 

A new element entered into the life of China 
when the western nations, in their quest of dis- 
covery, trade, and colonies, began to push their 
ships into Chinese ports. For two centuries 
these nations came in peaceful ways upon mis- 
sions of peace. They asked the privilege of 
trade, to buy the commodities which China had 
in abundance to sell ; to sell such merchandise 
as Chinamen might wish to buy. Especially 
did they wish that their representatives might 
be received by the Emperor, and might treat 
on equal and honorable terms with function- 
aries of suitable rank whom he might deign to 
appoint. From the first the western nations 
determined to allow their representatives to 
submit to no ceremony degrading in form or 
meant to typify homage or vassalage towards a 
superior. For a long time the Chinese author- 
ities evidenced a purpose not to permit any 
approach to the emperor under other conditions. 

There was also a rooted aversion to trade. 
The Chinese feared and believed that the bal- 
ance of trade would be against them ; that her 
people would buy more than they could sell, 
the balance to be paid by the withdrawal of 
coin, which they were convinced would result 
in bankruptcy. They had not learned that 
trade begets trade. 

From time to time these conflicts of ideas 
developed into conflicts of arms, in which the 
Chinese were unable to contend successfully. 
The first passage at arms was with England in 
1840. Unfortunately, the admission of opium 
was one of the points at issue. As to this, Mr. 
Boulger contends, and with apparent reason, 
that the opium question was raised by the Chi- 
nese only as a pretext. In the discussions which 
preceded the appeal to arms, English merchants 
gave up opium to the amount of $10,000,000 
for confiscation ; but the lives of eighteen En- 
glishmen, to be yielded without trial or pro- 
cess of law, they would not concede. After a 
critical study of the facts, our own ex-President 
John Quincy Adams asserted that the real issue 
of this so-called opium war was not opium but 



the Kotow, and that the English were in the 
right. 

The English were victorious, and a treaty of 
amity was negotiated at Nankin, only to be 
evaded, and its ratification avoided, until, in a 
later resort to arms, the English forced the 
defenses at Pekin and dictated terms of sur- 
render. Conflicts with other nations have re- 
sulted in like misfortune to the Chinese. 

An interesting chapter describes the rise and 
progress of the Taeping Rebellion, and its 
desultory character, too weak to succeed, yet 
fighting a government too weak to overcome it. 
An American named Ward collected and drilled 
a force of 5000 Chinese, to which he gave, by 
way of bravado, the name of the Ever Victo- 
rious Army, a name which it presently earned 
the right to wear. Ward was killed in action. 
His successor, an adventurer named Burgevine, 
after hiring himself in turn to both rebels and 
the imperial power, was repudiated by both. 
Then began the remarkable career of one Cap- 
tain Charles Gordon, afterwards known as 
" Chinese " Gordon. He gathered, drilled, 
disciplined, and fought an army of Chinese 
with phenomenal success, and destroyed the 
rebellion. His sad fortune when, in Africa, he 
was abandoned to the fury of the Mahdists, is 
too well remembered. 

The story of the war with Japan, sharp, 
short, and decisive, is told with a true appre- 
ciation of this highly dramatic event. The 
lessons taught by this war only repeat those 
which should have been learned before. Under 
stress of suffering, China spent her treasure for 
weapons of the best manufacture, ships of the 
most approved design, and fortresses which by 
nature and art should have been impregnable. 
The only use she has been able to make of her 
forts, her ships, and her guns, is to hand them 
over to her victorious foes. Her soldiers can 
fight under proper officers, and they can die ; 
but they did not avail against the Japanese. 
Her officers and diplomats appear to be equally 
deficient. Defeats teach them no principles of 
public policy. The logic of artillery is effect- 
ive only within the range of the piece. 

The distressing feature of the Chinese situ- 
ation exists in the conditions of its intellectual 
life. For centuries this has suffered from a 
sort of creeping paralysis. It is permeated by 
an intellectual dry-rot, which has consumed all 
personal, social, and political vitality. The ex- 
terior may have been fair to see, but when the 
armor of exclusiveness is pierced the whole 
structure crumbles. The cause of the disease

[Jan. 16 r 



must be coextensive with the disease. It will 
be found in the combined systems of civil ser- 
vice and of education. Much has been heard 
in praise of both. Every public officer must 
win his appointment by merit, and that merit 
is judged by the accuracy of his education. 
Without considering the utilities which might 
grow out of such conditions, we observe that 
they fail to follow here because the education 
required is that of the Chinese type, an educa- 
tion which does not educate. It is an education 
that is purely formal and without vitality. It 
has no stimulus, no power of development, no 
illumination. Its vision is ever backward, never 
forward. Only the thing that hath been is that 
which shall be. The wise maxims of Confucius 
and of Mencius appear to have little influence 
upon life and action. The scientific phase is 
conspicuously absent. The stimulus of the 
science of the nineteenth century has not been 
felt in China. 

In marked contrast has been the action of 
the Japanese. After an earnest resistance, sud- 
denly the Japanese saw a great light, and be- 
gan to glean from the science and the discipline 
of the Occident whatever could be adapted in 
the Orient. The whole nation rejoices in the 
consequent revival. But the Chinese persist- 
ently debars not merely Western merchandise 
but also Western science and Western culture 
as well. 

The impending fall of the Manchu dynasty 
need cause no regrets. It had no natural rights 
in China, and it has been an insurmountable 
barrier to national development. The world 
must wish that a better fate might befall an 
empire so ancient and venerable. The situation 
is thus stated by Mr. Boulger : 

" If the Chinese realized their position there would 
be ground for hope; but so far as can be judged, there 
is not a public man in China who perceives that the 
state is on the verge of dissolution, and that nothing 
short of the most strenuous exertion will avail to save 
not the dynasty but the country from death."

RECENT POETRY.* 

A few reminiscences of a sojourn " In Palestine" 
gives the title to a new volume of verse now put forth, 
by Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, after a silence of 
nearly five years. The volume contains, besides 
versified memories of Egypt, Greece, and Provence, 
songs of the finer heroism, and many of those per- 
sonal and occasional pieces in the writing of which 
Mr. Gilder is an adept. The following irregular 
sonnet may he taken as an example of the best of 
the work here offered us. 

" Love's look finds loveliness in all the world : 

Ah, who shall say This, this is loveliest ! 
Forgetting that pure beauty is impearled 

A thousand perfect ways, and none is best. 
Sometimes I deem that dawn upon the ocean 

Thrills deeper than all else ; but, sudden, there, 
With serpent gleam and hue, and fixed motion, 

Niagara curves its scimetar in air. 
So when I dream of sunset, oft I gaze 

Again from Bellosguardo's misty height, 
Or memory ends once more one day of days 

Carrara's mountains purpling into night. 
There is no loveliest, dear Love, but thee 
Through whom all loveliness I breathe and see."

THE DIAL 



The following passage, from " A Winter Twilight 
in Provence " a poem inspired by thought of the 
wars that once ravaged that fair land was written 
two years ago, and is not without an ironic applica- 
tion to the events of the past few months. 

" Dear country mine ! far in that viewless west, 
And ocean-warded, strife thou too hast known ; 
But may thy sun hereafter bloodless shine, 
And may thy way be onward without wrath, 
And upward on no carcass of the slain ; 
And if thou smitest, let it be for peace 
And justice not in hate, or pride, or lust 
Of empire. Mayst thou ever be, O land, 
Noble and pure as thou art free and strong ! 
So shalt thou lift a light for all the world 
And for all time, and bring the Age of Peace." 

Two years ago these ideals seemed to earnest Amer- 
icans not impossible of realization ; to-day, they are 
clearly considered by great numbers of our fellow- 
citizens as the merest counsels of perfection, not to be 
taken into serious account by the practical statesman. 
Will not Mr. Gilder write for us a new " Ichabod," 
inscribed this time, not to an individual, but to a 
nation, in danger of proving recreant? 

Mr. Madison Cawein has put forth numerous 
volumes of verse, and the last of them is like the 
first and all the others in the general impression 
left by their perusal. That impression is of marked 
poetical powers carelessly employed. The author 
has sensibility, and even passion ; he has also con- 
siderable facility in the use of poetic diction ; but 
he has none of the restraint that should go with 
these qualities, and it is obvious that much of his 
verse is hastily flung from him with little care for 
its fate. In his new volume of " Idyllic Mono- 
logues," for example, there is no justification for so 
rough a line as this from " The Moated Manse," 

"The year-old scars, made by the Royalists' balls," 
or for the violence of language that characterizes 
the greater part of this poem. Half a dozen or more 
of these versified narratives fill all but a few pages 
of the volume. In these few latter pages the author 
gets greatly excited about the destruction of the 
" Maine " and the atrocities of Spanish rule, showing 
that his verse can be as hot-tempered when it deals 
with actual history as when it is concerned with vain 
romantic imaginings. For an extract since there 
should be one we will take a stanza in which Mr. 
Cawein is at his best, because at his simplest. 
" Here where the season turns the land to gold, 
Among the fields our feet have known of old, 
When we were children who could laugh and run, 
Glad little playmates of the wind and sun, 
Before came toil and care and years went ill, 
And one forgot and one remembered still, 
Heart of my heart, among the old fields here, 
Give me your hands and let me draw you near, 
Heart of my heart." 

Early in the examination of Mr. George Cabot 
Lodge's volume of verse, on two pages that face 
each other, we find this stanza, the ocean speaking : 
" I have lavished my largess of comfort, 

Taken earth in mine arms like a child, 
Taught the children of life of its splendour, 
Brought their eyes to the light unbeguiled." 



And this, of the wave : 

" This is the song of the wave ! the mighty one ! 
Child of the soul of silence, beating the air to sound : 
White as a live terror, as a drawn sword, 
This is the wave." 

Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Henley, we say at once, 
and these names are suggested many times over in 
what follows. A little later, we come upon an 
" After- Word " in this strain : 

" What of life-songs then, and what of death-songs ? 
Sound and fury down the babbling ages, 
They shall cease, the echoes pass and perish ; 
On the void the 'stablishment eternal 
Bides alone the Soul's gigantic silence," 

and we know that Mr. Lodge has taken his Brown- 
ing to heart. These things, and work so frankly 
imitative as " The Gates of Life," which is a vari- 
ation upon Mr. Swinburne's " Hesperia," are not 
set down to Mr. Lodge's discredit. He is clearly a 
young writer such gloom and world -weariness, 
such echoes of Leconte de 1'Isle and Leopardi, are 
the certain evidence of that, and he is without the 
saving sense of humor, as one may see from the 
appeal to his own soul to " be stern and adequate," 
which somehow reminds us of the 

"Terrible, indigne", calme, extraordinaire" 
of Victor Hugo, who thus describes the attitude 
which he will assume when face to face with God. 
But Mr. Lodge has studied good models of the sort 
of poetry young men most affect, and most poets 
find themselves by first sitting at the feet of their 
masters. In spite of all that we have said, Mr. 
Lodge's work seems to us to be full of promise ; its 
utterance is large, and its rhythmic power is unde- 
niable. He is most clearly himself in such a poem 
as " Fall," from which we extract, with genuine 
pleasure, these closing lines, inspired by an autumn 
dawn : 

"This moment stolen from the centuries, 
This foretaste of the soul's oblivion 
We hold and cherish, and because of this 
Are life and death made perfect, and thy woes 
Turn lyric through the glory we have won. 
The morning flower that drew its petals close 
And slept the cold night through is now unfurled 
To catch the breathless moment ; big and sane 
Our autumn day forsakes the gates of rose, 
And like a lion shakes its golden mane 
And leaps upon the world." 

Mr. Claude Fayette Bragdon's book is easily re- 
viewed. There are about forty pages of it, averag- 
ing seven lines to a page. " The Golden Person in 
the Heart," the titular poem, is a versified statement 
of the essentials of Brahmanism. This is the sort 
of thing : 

" A man, to cleanse this inward mirror, should 

Before all else, learn and obey the law, 
And next acquire a blameless livelihood : 
Steadfast in duty and in doing good, 
His mind from things of sense let him withdraw." 

A captious person might think that the author of 
this poem had complied with the counsel of the last 
line, but Emerson's " Brahma " met with the same 
criticism. Our objection is that it is not poetry.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



The rest of the book consists of such things as 
" Cities." 

" New York, London, Paris, Rome, 

Seemed vast and grand while I staid home, 

But seeing them, I soon found that 

I held them all beneath my hat." 

All of which is not very promising. 

The sheaf of verses gleaned by Mr. Wallace Rice 
from the growth of many years of preoccupation 
with poetical matters contains a number of skilfully- 
wrought pieces. " Chryseis on the Sands " is partic- 
ularly charming, and here is the last of its three 
stanzas : 

" Ages ago old Chryses clasped his daughter, 

Happy that she was his and not the King's ; 
Smiling through tears beside that Asian water 
Lovely Chryseis, home at last, still stands. 
Many another bard some maiden sings 
Dearer to me Chryseis on the sands, 
Ages ago." 

Mr. Rice has been the artificer of many sonnets, but 
with rare restraint has adjudged only one of them 
deserving of a place in this little volume. Would 
that other poets might submit their work to this 
process of natural selection ! The sonnet in ques- 
tion is a fine improvisation upon the greatest of 
Spinoza's great words. 

" No freeman, saith the wise, thinks much on death: 
No man with soul he dareth call his own 
Liveth in dread lest there be no atone 
In time to come for yesterday's warm breath, 
No more than he for such end hungereth 
As falls to those who speed their souls a-groan ; 
Death may be King, to sit a tottering throne 
And hale men hence let cowards cringe to Death ! 

" Who giveth, taketh ; and the days go by, 

No seed sowed we ; let him who did come reap : 

Sweet peace is ours and everlastingly, 
A little sleep, a little slumber : Aye, 

This much is known : there is for thee and me 
A little folding of the hands to sleep." 

Songs and sonnets alternate, with almost unfailing 
regularity, in Mr. Clinton Scollard's fifty pages of 
new verse. " Summer by the Sea " is one of the 
best of the sonnets. 

" If thou wonldst win the rhythmic heart of things, 

Go sit in solitude beside the shore, 

Giving thine ear to the eternal roar 
And every mystic message that it brings 
Eddas of ancient, nnremembered kings, 

And runes that ring with long-forgotten lore. 

All myths and mysteries from the years of yore 
Ere Time grew weary on his journeyings. 

" And more from that imperious sibyl, Sea, 

Thou mayest learn if thou wilt hearken well, 

When God's white star-fires beacon home the ships : 
The solemn secrets of infinity, 
Unto the inner sense translatable, 

Hang trembling ever on her darkling lips." 

This might have for its text the " Time's self it is, 
made audible," of Rossetti's matchless lyric. 

The poems of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe have been 
collected into a volume which bears the title " From 
Sunset Ridge." 

" Of all my verses, say that one is good " 
is her modest plea to the critic, but the author of 



the " Battle-Hymn of the Republic " may safely 
await a larger measure of approval than that. Still, 
the famous poem just named remains almost the 
only one in the volume that makes the impression 
of spontaneity ; no doubt it was thought out, like 
the others ; but the difference is that the others 
show that they have been studied, and the " Battle- 
Hymn " does not. The poems are mostly personal 
or occasional, strongly infused with religious senti- 
ment, and pointing some very marked moral. Mrs. 
Howe is at her best in such verses as these addressed 
to Pio Nono : 

" Where glory should have crowned thee, failure whelms, 
Truth judges thee, that should have made thee great ; 
Thine is the doom of souls that cannot bring 
Their highest courage to their highest fate," 

or these upon Dante : 

"See, beneath the hood of grief, 
Muffled bays engird the brow. 
Fame shall yield her topmost bough 
Ere that laurel moult a leaf." 

At first sight Mrs. Higginson's collection of 
poems, " When the Birds Go North Again," seems 
to be the usual sort of thing. There are sonnets, 
and lyrics, and bits of religious or didactic verse 
all upon such themes as every versifier attempts. A 
closer examination, however, reveals the fact that this 
writer, while often amateurish in manner and crude 
in technique, has an unusual gift of passionate imag- 
ination, and at her best rises high above the plane 
whereon most minor poets disport themselves. We 
take Mrs. Higginson's best to be such work as this : 
" God, let me be a mountain when I die, 

Stung by the hail, lashed by tormenting rains ! 
Let lava fires surge, turbulent and high, 

With fiercest torture thro' my bursting veins ; 
Let lightnings flame around my lonely brow, 

And mighty storm-clouds race, and break, and roar 
About me ; let the melted lava plough 

Raw furrows in my breast, torment me sore, 
O God ! Let me hate loneliness, yet see 
My very forest felled beneath my eyes. 
Give me all Time's distilled agony, 

Yet let me still stand, mute, beneath the skies ; 
Thro' storms that beat and inward fires that burn, 

Tortured, yet silent ; suffering, yet pure, 
That torn and tempted hearts may lift and learn 
The noble meaning of the word, endure. 1 ' 

The ending is feeble enough, but what precedes has 
no small measure of daring strength. " A Thank- 
Offering " is another poem from which we must 
quote three stanzas : 

" Lord God, for some of us the days and years 

Have bitter been ; 

For some of us the burden and the tears. 
The gnawing sin. 

" For some of us, God, the scanty store, 

The failing bin ; 
For some of us the gray wolf at the door, 

The red, within ! 
" But to the hungry Thou hast given meat, 

Hast clothed the cold ; 

And Thou hast given courage strong and sweet 
To the sad and old." 

If we had space for further quotation, the two son- 
nets, " Yet Am I not for Pity," should be given, but 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

we must be content to say that the volume which 
contains them will well repay examination, and is a 
promising addition to American minor poetry. 

Mrs. Perry's " Impressions " are lyrical pieces, 
taking the form of the song, the sonnet, or the ron- 
deau, and embodying in graceful verse many a mood 
of rapture, tenderness, and spiritual aspiration. We 
choose for our example the lines which go with 
" A Flower from Carnac." 
" I plucked this bit of yellow gorse for thee 
By a huge menhir where on Carnac's shore 
The long waves murmur dirges evermore 
For men dead ere the birth of history. 
Here once they lived whom Time's immensity 
Hath quite o'erwhelmed, and blotted out their page 
From the world's book ! On them may learned sage 
Descant, and poet dream, here by the sea! 

" But none may know what were their thoughts, their lives 
None e'er may know ! none living or unborn ! 
Were these their tombs built where the strong sea strives 
In vain to hold the warm elusive sands ? 
Were these hard by their altars, where forlorn 
They stretched to Heaven imploring empty hands? " 

The spiritual quality, so marked in this sonnet, is 

the predominant characteristic of Mrs. Perry's pure 

and heartfelt song. 

A slight volume of sonnets and lyrics by Miss 

Guiney, entitled " England and Yesterday," proves 

one of the most acceptable collections of the year ; 

its finished and delicate art may be illustrated by 

" A Porch in Belgravia." 

" When, after dawn, the lordly houses hide 
Till you fall foul of it, some piteous guest, 
(Some girl the damp stones gather to their breast, 
Her gold hair rough, her rebel garment wide, 
Who sleeps, with all that luck and life denied 
Camped round, and dreams how seaward and southwest 
Blue over Devon farms the smoke- rings rest, 
And sheep and lambs ascend the lit hillside), 
Dear, of your charity, speak low, step soft, 
Pray for a sinner. Planet-like and still, 
Best hearts of all are sometimes set aloft 
Only to see and pass, nor yet deplore 
Even Wrong itself, crowned Wrong inscrutable, 
Which cannot but have been, forever more." 

Suggestions of the history and literature of England 
provide themes for most of these poems, the one we 
have quoted being made somewhat exceptional, not 
so much by its sympathy with suffering as by its 
note of modernity. 

Two neat volumes contain the verses left by two 
men, residents of Chicago, who died at an early age. 
Ben King, who died in 1894, and whose literary 
remains are gathered up and edited by three of his 
devoted friends, was a journalist whose marked 
talent found expression in dialect verses of the rustic 
type, in rollicking negro songs, and in such broadly 
pointed jests as " That Valentine." 

" Once, I remember, years ago, 

I sent a tender valentine ; 
I know it caused a deal of woe. 
Once, I remember, years ago, 
Her father's boots were large, you know. 

I do regret the hasty line, 
Once, I remember, years ago, 

I sent a tender valentine." 



The best-known pieces of this writer are the two 
beginning 

" If I should die to-night " 
and 

" Nothing to do but work, 
Nothing to eat but food." 

These have been widely reprinted and praised by 
his admirers. 

The " Poems " left by Francis Brooks, who died 
early last year, make a volume far more serious and 
significant than the one just mentioned. The inter- 
esting introductory memoir supplied by the editor, 
Mr. Wallace Rice, tells us of the life of the poet, 
how he became, first a lawyer, then a physician, 
and how, when " professional success was in his very 
grasp, the voice within him grew too strong to be 
disregarded," and he set about becoming a poet. 
Nearly two years ago, the first-fruits of his literary 
labors took shape in a small volume called " Mar- 
gins." It was distinctly promising, but the writer 
still knew that he had much to learn, of both nature 
and life, and determined upon an experiment simi- 
lar to that made by Mr. Walter Wyckoff, the results 
of which are recorded in the fascinating volumes of 
" The Workers." In a word, Brooks set out to work 
his way from Chicago to California, and to learn 
the common lot of mankind by accepting to the full 
its responsibilities and its hardships. The under- 
taking was too much for his physical powers, and he 
returned to his home in the grasp of a fever that 
resulted in his untimely death at the age of thirty- 
one. Of the three sections which comprise this 
volume of his work, the first reproduces the " Mar- 
gins " that formed his only publication during life. 
They are somewhat too irregular to be good poetry, 
and betray the influence of Whitman, although in 
attitude and spirit rather than in form. They were, 
in fact, dedicated " To Him " 

" Whose plenteous hand and fertile brain 
Bid flowers that fade to bloom again, 
Whose eyes are sanctity, whose brow 
Doth wear the aureole e'en now." 

The second section, called " Preludes," reveals an 
advance in finish and an increasing depth of thought, 
and closes with four really remarkable quatorzains 
suggested by the life of Christ. One of them 
" Jesus Wept " we quote. 

" At eve He rested there amidst the grass, 

And as the stars shone out He dreamed of God, 
His destiny, the distant kingdom all of glass 

And gold ; He watched the reapers homeward plod ; 
Became aware of strength for holy deeds 

Astir within Him ; turned His eyes to where 
The Great Sea rolled a sight that ever breeds 

A hunger for deep powers ; felt that there 
A symbol was of His far-spreading mind, 

His restless strong desire, and marked perchance 
The tiny specks of moving sail ; divined 

Of time and space the secret circumstance, 
And when His gaze was wearied, softly wept 
And was consoled then to His shelter crept." 

The third section contains nearly a hundred pieces, 
all in the same simple yet elaborate form of verse, 
a variation devised by the author upon the basis of 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



the roundel. We may take " The Reformer " to 
illustrate at once the form of the verse and the ar- 
dent aspiration of the writer for a purer national life. 

" He sought not fame, he made no claim, 
He longed to see the spirit's flame 
Burn out a venal nation's shame, 
He sought not fame. 

" But faithful still through scorn, neglect, 
Through ridicule and dear hopes wrecked. 
Always with love he struck the lyre, 
Ne'er in revenge, hatred, nor ire. 

11 Here but a shard I bring the bard, 
Misfortune's own and evil-starred 
Burnt in the glaze, unbroken, hard. 
He sought not fame." 

" Blots on the fair fame of his country," says the 
editor, " affected him like personal disgrace, and, 
next to singleness of purpose, patriotism sounds the 
fundamental note of his best lines." We may add 
that we have rarely been so impressed with a poet's 
absolute sincerity as we have in reading this volume. 

Bhartrihari was a Brahman of princely lineage, 
who is said to have reigned in Oujein early in the 
Christian era. Like Buddha, he forsook his state, 
and went to cultivate philosophy in a cave for the 
rest of his life. A little book of epigrams bearing 
his name has come down to us, and Mr. Paul Elmer 
More has put an even hundred of them into English 
verse, not, however, without taking liberties like 
those taken by FitzGerald in his dealings with the 
Tent-maker. The motive that made a philosopher 
of the prince is given in this quatrain : 

"Better, I said, in trackless woods to roam 

With chattering apes or the dumb grazing herds, 
Than dwell with fools, though in a prince's home, 
And bear the dropping of their ceaseless words." 

It is the full-grown philosopher who speaks in the 
following verses : 

" Like as our outworn garments we discard, 
And other new ones don : 

So doth the Soul these bodies doff when marred 
And others new put on. 

" Fire doth not kindle It, nor sword divides, 
Nor winds nor waters harm ; 
Eternal and unchanged the One abides, 
And smiles at all alarm." 

Finally, it is the deepest of all spiritual experiences 
that is reflected in this counsel : 

" Like an uneasy fool thou wanderest far 
Into the nether deeps, 
Or upward climbest where the dim-lit star 
Of utmost heaven sleeps. 

"Through all the world thou rangest, O my soul, 
Seeking and wilt not rest ; 
Behold, the peace of Brahma, and thy goal, 
Hideth in thine own breast." 

The thought of this Sanskrit sage is well worth 
studying in Mr. More's agreeable transcription. 

Yiddish is the dialect, compounded of German 
and Hebrew, with some admixture of Slavonic, 
spoken by many of the Jews in Russia and Austria. 
It has had a sort of literature of its own for some 
four centuries, but nothing noteworthy until of late, 
when it has become the vehicle of a considerable 



amount of folk-song. Its most remarkable achieve- 
ment, however, is found in the songs of Mr. Morris 
Rosenfeld, a Polish Jew who learned the tailor's 
trade, and as an American immigrant spent many 
years of weary toil in the sweat-shops of New York. 
His verses, recently brought to the attention of the 
critic by Mr. Leo Wiener, are now published in a 
volume that sets the Yiddish and the English trans- 
lation face to face with one another. They are true 
lyrical treasure-trove, and, lest the name of Yiddish 
terrify our reader overmuch, we hasten to explain 
that to read these poems is merely to read German 
and hunt up an occasional unfamiliar word in the 
glossary. An illustration will make this clear. 

" Nit vun Friihling's siissen Wetter, 
Nit vun Engel, nit vun Gotter 
Singt der ehrlicher Poet ; 
Nit vun Felder, nit vun Teichen, 
Was gehoren jetzt zum Reichen, 
Nor vun Kworin, was er seht. 

" Elend seht er, Not un' Schmerzen, 
Wunden tragt er tief im Herzen, 
Nit gelindert, nit gestillt ; 
Auf dem grossen Welt-bessalmen 
Kraehzt er trauerige Psalmen, 
Sfeimmt er an sein Harf un' spielt." 

Given " Bessalmen " = cemetery, and " Kworim " = 
graves, the rest is plain enough. It must be said, 
however, that the poet fails to live up to his own 
principles, for he does sing, and very melodiously, 
of spring and green fields and nightingales. Still, 
the most insistent note of his song is doubtless that 
of sympathy for the toiler, a sympathy born from 
bitter personal experience, and poignant in its 
pathos. He might almost be called the Heine of 
the sweat-shop and the factory, and his message is 
one that should strike deep into the heart of every 
generous reader. 

Dr. William Henry Drummond, of Montreal, 
whose verses in portrayal of the life and dialect of 
the Canadian habitant have won so much favor for 
both author and subject, now publishes a small illus- 
trated volume containing two poems. The first, 
called " Phil-o-rum's Canoe," is in the dialect the 
author knows so intimately, the last stanza being : 
" You can only steer, an' if rock be near, wit' wave dashin' 

all aroun', 
Better mak' leetle prayer, for on Dead Riviere, some very 

smart man get drown ; 
But if you be locky an' watch yourse'f , mebbe reever won't 

seem so wide, 
An firse t'ing you know you '11 ronne ashore, safe on de 'nodder 

side." 

" Madeleine Vercheres," on the other hand, is in 
orthodox English, and tells a stirring tale of how a 
French maiden defended a fort from the Iroquois 
for six days, and until succor came from a distance. 
It is a ballad not unlike those of which Whittier 
had so many to tell. 

Few poets get so near as Mr. Duncan Campbell 
Scott to the very heart of nature. 

" In every heart the heart of spring 

Bursts into leaf and bud ; 
The heart of love in every heart 
Leaps with its eager flood."

His new volume, " Labor and the Angel," is full of 
lovely songs, and none of them are more captivating 
than the four inscribed to the four seasons, and to 
the singer's " love Armitage." We reluctantly pass 
the first three by, to select the " Winter Song " 
which follows : 

"Sing me a song of the dead world, 

Of the great frost deep and still, 

Of the sword of fire the wind hurled 

On the iron hill. 

" Sing me a song of the driving snow, 
Of the reeling cloud and the smoky drift, 
Where the sheeted wraiths like ghosts go 
Through the gloomy rift. 

*' Sing me a song of the ringing blade, 
Of the snarl and shatter the light ice makes, 
Of the whoop and the swing of the snow-shoe raid 
Through the cedar brakes. 

44 Sing me a song of the apple-loft, 
Of the corn and the nuts and the mounds of meal, 
Of the sweeping whir of the spindle soft, 
And the spinning-wheel. 

' Sing me a song of the open page, 
Where the ruddy gleams of the firelight dance, 
Where bends my love Armitage, 
Reading an old romance. 

" Sing me a song of the still nights, 
Of the large stars steady and high, 
The aurora darting its phosphor lights 
In the purple sky." 

Of this poet we may safely say that the vision of 
the world is his, and the sentiment that lends beauty 
to the interpretation. 

Toward the close of the year 1870, Mr. George 
Meredith wrote an ode to France, then suffering 
the double humiliation of defeat and invasion. It 
was a noble poem, perhaps the finest that Mr. Mere- 
dith has ever written. This we said when it made 
its first appearance in one of the author's books, and 
'this we repeat after thinking the matter over for a 
number of years. Such a passage as the following 
would probably have been accepted by Matthew 
.Arnold as an example of the grand style in poetry. 
" Forgetful is green earth ; the Gods alone 
Remember everlastingly : they strike 
Remorselessly, and ever like for like. 
By their great memories Gods are known." 

.Nearly thirty years have passed since this ode was 
written, and the author now gives us three new "Odes 
in Contribution to the Song of French History," 
.their subjects being " The Revolution," " Napoleon," 
and " Alsace-Lorraine." In the volume that con- 
tains them he defiantly reprints the " France " of 
1870, deliberately forcing a comparison between 
the two manners thus illustrated. We have made 
a quotation from the early poem, let us now extract 
a characteristic passage from one of the later odes. 
The subject of the passage we surmise to be Napo- 
,leon ; but this is a world of uncertainties, and we will 
,not be dogmatic. 

" Hugest of engines, a much limited man, 
She saw the Lustrous, her great lord, appear 
Through that smoked glass her last privation brought 
To point her critic eye and spur her thought : 
A heart but to propel Leviathan ; 
A spirit that breathed but in earth's atmosphere. 



Amid the plumed and sceptred ones 
Irradiatingly Jovian, 

The mountain tower capped by the floating cloud ; 
A nursery screamer where dialectics ruled : 
Mannerless, graceless, laughterless, unlike 
Herself in all, yet with such power to strike 
That she the various features she could scan, 
Dared not to sum, though seeing : and befooled 
By power that beamed omnipotent, she bowed, 
Subservient as roused echo round his guns." 

In the name of all that is clear and sane and sym- 
metrical, we feel bound to protest against this riot 
of the parts of speech. We have not singled out 
an extremely unintelligible passage ; the poems con- 
tain scores of others just as muddy as this, and com- 
pared with them the most violent conceits of Donne 
or Sir Thomas Browne would seem to be reading 
for infant minds. We have no doubt that this pas- 
sage and its fellows have meanings ; we have no 
doubt that many readers might with due diligence 
work out those meanings ; but we have also no 
doubt that such an effort would be a woeful misap- 
plication of energy. These tailings of Mr. Mere- 
dith's ore are not rich enough to be worth treatment. 
What was once merely an affectation with him has 
become a disease, and we have no wish to inquire 
too curiously into his understanding of " incalescent 
scorpions " and " hydrocephalic aerolites," or to ask 
his interpretation of that Jabberwocky verse, 
"The friable and the grumous, dizzards both." 
But it may be observed, in concluding these remarks 
about a most perverse book, that not only have 
lucidity and proportion and style disappeared from 
Mr. Meredith's verse, but even music has accompa- 
nied them in their dismayed flight. " Rightly, then, 
should France worship, and deafen the disaccord 
of those who dare withstand an irresistible sword 
to thwart his predestined subjection of Europe." 
Would anyone, reading this, have the remotest sus- 
picion that it claimed to be poetry ? And of such 
verbiage as this are the " Odes " largely composed. 
If we have ever read verses more stale, flat, and 
unprofitable than Mr. Mackenzie Bell's " Pictures 
of Travel, and Other Poems," we cannot now recall 
the occasion. Why on earth should a man write 
and publish such stuff as this ? 

" 'Tis true amid our earthly life there runs 
A tangled thread of strange perplexity 
And much injustice ; yet comes by and by 
A nobler state of being, when that which seems 
Unjust will be explained or set aright." 

Or this? 

" Yet God who gave the pureness 

To yon fair mountain snow 
Gives also the secureness 
Whereby these roses blow." 

We have found nothing in the entire volume that 
rises much above the bald commonplace of these 
extracts. Yet it is a printed book. " This also is 
a mystery of life," as Mr. Ruskin says. 

If Dr. Conan Doyle has any regard for what is 
left of his literary reputation, he will allow his 
" Songs of Action " to remain the only volume of 
verses to which his name is attached. He is not a

poet, and could never by any possibility become 
one. We have looked through this volume in vain 
for a single gleam of poetic feeling or a single 
instance of felicitous expression. We get instead 
martial episodes done in verse, horsey ballads, a 
poor imitation of Mr. Kipling's patriotic fervor, but 
nothing much nearer poetry than this " Parable ": 

" The cheese-mites asked how the cheese got there, 

And warmly debated the matter ; 
The Orthodox said that it came from the air, 

And the heretics said from the platter. 
They argued it long and they argued it strong, 

And I hear they are arguing now ; 
But of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese, 

Not one of them thought of a cow." 

Mr. Charles Camp Tarelli's " Persephone " is a 
metrical version of the familiar form of the myth, 
done in easy hexameters like these : 
" Wide is the peopled earth, and many the hosts of the living ; 
Wider the realms of the shade, and the crowded legions of 

silent, 

Pale, and bodiless ghosts more numberless far than the toiling, 
Striving, rejoicing men who bless thee for prosperous har- 
vests." 

The poem is a pleasing performance, but praise must 
end with that statement. It is followed by two 
longish pieces, " Magna Mater " and " A Song of 
Arrival and Departure," which have in common the 
minor chord of Weltschmerz, which in both cases 
works into a crashing and triumphant resolution. 
The remaining contents are short things, sonnets, 
rondeaus, sestinas, and the like. The elegiac ode 
to Catullus is happily achieved, both as verse and 
characterization, and is not un suggestive of the 
classical experiments of Tennyson. Perhaps the 
most distinctive feature of these charming poems is 
the ever-recurring appeal to Nature as the sure 
refuge of the soul in distress. 

" O Mother ! lift again my head low- bowed, 
My aching head the bitter garland binds ; 
Quicken me with new life ; let thy great winds 

Blow on me through the swaying of thy trees ; 
Sweep by me with thy pageants of grey cloud, 
And rock me with the rolling of thy seas." 

This note occurs again and again, ringing and clear ; 
it is the final word of the poet's philosophy.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

A Briton's Readers of that fascinating work, 

view of his Baedeker's "United States," will 

American kin. welcome a new book by the author, 
Mr. James Fullarton Muirhead, who now, in a less 
formal style than that conditioned by the guide- 
book, gives us " a Briton's view of his American 
kin " in a volume entitled " The Land of Contrasts " 
(Lamson). It is an attractive volume throughout, 
and not the least so in the penultimate chapter of 
" Baedekeriana," which empties the ragbag of the 
writer's recollections into the receptive lap of the 
reader. Why the book is entitled as it is may be 
illustrated by one of the many reasons given. " I 



have hailed with delight the democratic spirit dis- 
played in the greeting of my friend and myself by 
the porter of a hotel as ' You fellows,' and then had 
the cup of pleasure dashed from my lips by being 
told by the same porter that 'the other gentleman 
would attend to my baggage ! " A great many 
other contrasts are noted with similar good-humored 
acceptance of the conditions of life in a strange 
country. Mr. Muirhead knows us better than do 
most of the Englishmen who undertake to write 
about " the States," for he gave three years of travel 
and observation to the preparation of his " Bae- 
deker," and has since then become almost as good 
an American as the rest of us. He is as fair-minded 
as Mr. Bryce, and is ever ready to match our short- 
comings with those of his own people. Like most 
visitors from other countries, he is amazed at the 
easy-going way with which we put up with nuisances. 
" Americans invented the slang word ' kicker,' but 
so far as I could see, their vocabulary is here miles 
ahead of their practice ; they dream noble deeds, 
but do not do them. Englishmen ' kick ' much 
better, without having a name for it." Mr. Muir- 
head's tribute to the beauty of the White City is 
worth quoting in part. " We expected that America 
would produce the largest, most costly, and most 
gorgeous of all international exhibitions ; but who 
expected that she would produce anything so inex- 
pressibly poetic, chaste, and restrained, such an 
absolutely refined and soul-satisfying picture, as the 
Court of Honour, with its lagoon and gondolas, its 
white marble steps and balustrades, its varied yet 
harmonious buildings, its colonnaded vista of the 
great lake, its impressive fountain, its fairy-like out- 
lining after dark by the gems of electricity, its 
spacious and well-modulated proportions which 
made the largest crowd in it but an unobtrusive 
detail, its air of spontaneity and inevitableness 
which suggested nature itself, rather than art ? . . . 
It will to all time remain impossibly ridiculous to 
speak of a country or a city as wholly given over to 
the worship of Mammon which almost involuntarily 
gave birth to this ethereal emanation of pure and 
uneconomic beauty." It is still another of the au- 
thor's " contrasts " which impels him, on the next 
page, to speak of Chicago church architecture as 
" a studied insult to religion," a criticism which we 
must admit to be only too true. One of Mr. Muir- 
head's meatiest chapters is devoted to that calamity 
of our civilization that is known as American jour- 
nalism. The Sunday newspaper is pleasantly styled 
a " hog-trough," which it frequently is, and the 
severest strictures are made upon the sensational- 
ism, the vulgarity, the puerility, the flippant bru- 
tality, and the general disregard of everything that 
is true and lovely so characteristic of the " enter- 
prise " of our newspaper proprietors. All this, too, 
we must admit is richly deserved, and we thank the 
author for saying it. One more observation, timely 
and well framed, must close these extracts. It was 
made before the outbreak of the recent war, and is 
even more apposite now than it was when the words

were written down. " The spectacle of a section 
in the United States apparently ready to step down 
from its pedestal of honorable neutrality, and run 
its head into the ignoble web of European compli- 
cations, was indeed one to make both gods and 
mortals weep." Whereby we may see that edifica- 
tion, as well as entertainment, is to be got from this 
most readable book. 

Readers of the last series of " Fors 
The predecessor of Clavigera," some fifteen years ago, 

Major Marchand. M i i i ,1 . -r T 

will perhaps remember that Mr. Kus- 
kin had some words on Mungo Park. In writing 
of Scott, Mr. Ruskin tells of some conversations 
which Sir Walter had with the famous explorer, and 
speaks severely of the man who was willing to quit 
the devoted work of a country doctor by the Tweed 
for the sake of tracing " the lonely brinks of useless 
rivers." Mungo Park was a loyal and unselfish man 
in the performance of his duties among the hills of 
Selkirkshire. Mr. Ruskin thought it was the desire 
for personal gain that forced him into his fatal jour- 
ney. Such an idea is by no means given in the sketch 
of Mungo Park written by Mr. T. Banks Maclachan 
for the " Famous Scots " series (imported by Scrib- 
ner), and we are inclined to think that Mr. Ruskin 
was in this one case mistaken. The fascination of 
exploration and the curiosity of science, these were 
the causes of Mungo Park's embarking on his second 
expedition, these and the desire to carry out what he 
had worthily begun . Mungo Park was the discoverer 
of the Niger. When Mr. Ruskin calls the Niger 
a useless river, he speaks as many Englishmen would 
have spoken fifteen years ago. Last spring, however, 
a different opinion was prevalent. This book, contain- 
ing a good account of Mungo Park's explorations on 
behalf of England a hundred years ago, is especially 
pertinent now that England is beginning to be vexed 
that the French are taking to themselves all the ad- 
vantages of those discoveries. All the upper Niger, 
the whole of the course that Mungo Park in 1805 
sailed to his death, is now claimed and exploited by 
the French. From St. Louis they went to the Niger, 
from the Niger to Lake Chad and the Upper Congo, 
from the Upper Congo to Fashoda. Even Timbuctu, 
which Tennyson discovered for poetry, was discov- 
ered for commerce by the French, and perhaps 
with equal advantage. However that may be, this 
little book will be read just now, as much as a sort 
of political pamphlet as for any other reason. But 
although present affairs on the Niger are of instant 
interest, Mungo Park should not be forgotten. He 
journeyed from Gambia, almost alone, and discov- 
ered the upper waters of the river that had been so 
long a mystery. He went again ten years afterwards 
with a company of forty-four, found the Niger again, 
and sailed down it. From that expedition no one 
ever returned, nor did any account of the death of 
Mungo Park reach Europe for some years. One by 
one his men had perished, till at the last there were 
but three with him, when the remnant of the expe- 
dition was swallowed up in the great river in a des- 



perate attempt to escape from unnumbered enemies. 
It was a heroic end : nor shall we take it upon our- 
selves to say that Mungo Park would have done 
better to have lived and died a country doctor by the 
Tweed. A man who is willing to die in pursuit of his 
duty has some right to say what that duty is. 

Birds and ^ n a nea * vo ^ ume entitled " Bird 

bird-worship Gods " (A. S. Barnes & Co.), Mr. 
in antiquity. Charles De Kay presents some at- 

tractive essays discussing the ideas held in ancient 
Europe regarding birds. The subject has been 
strangely neglected by folk-lorists and anthropolo- 
gists. Many of the heroes and gods of antiquity 
are accompanied by or associated with bird compan- 
ions, messengers, or servants. These birds share 
more or less the divinity of their masters. Mr. 
De Kay thinks that in many cases the birds are 
themselves regarded as divine, and that the respect 
and worship shown their masters or companions 
were originally theirs alone. A number of cases 
are cited where the god-character of the birds them- 
selves is clearly shown. The birds most respected 
by the ancients appear to be the dove, woodpecker, 
cuckoo, peacock, owl, swan, and eagle. Their inde- 
pendent attributes are usually well distinguished, 
but considerable confusion of them exists both in 
the popular ideas and in Mr. De Kay's treatment. 
Some of the author's suggestions are striking and 
original. Thus, he connects our vulgar expression 
" I swan " with an ancient practice of " swearing 
by the swan." His effort to explain the couvade 
by popular ideas concerning the brooding bird and 
the cuckoo is ingenious. Unfortunately, however, 
this chapter " The Couvade in Ireland and Persia " 
is so lacking in clearness that it must be consid- 
ered simply as a suggestion along a line which, 
clearly developed, may prove important. While 
admitting the great interest and value of the book, 
we feel that the author somewhat overrates the 
weight of his evidence regarding bird -worship, 
although the previous neglect of so interesting a 
field is some excuse for this over-estimate. It is 
also interesting to see how easily ingenious authors 
can use the same data to support extremely diver- 
gent theories. What Mr. George Cox insists are 
sun-myths are equally well interpreted as dawn- 
stories by Professor Max Mtiller or as bird-god tales 
by Mr. De Kay. The decorations of this book really 
deserve the special mention they hold in the title. 
They are original, quaint, and truly artistic. The 
artist's ingenuity in his pictures is almost equal to 
that of the author in his text. On the whole, " Bird 
Gods " is distinctly interesting, alike to folk-lorists, 
students of mythology, and general readers. 

Horse-shoe Another volume of folk-lore studies 

magic and other is presented by Dr. Robert M. Law- 
joik-iore. rence, under the title of the opening 

chapter, " The Magic of the Horse-shoe " (Hough- 
ton). Dr. Lawrence has chosen a popular subject 
and treats it popularly. His book consists of a 



58 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



tn En 



number of essays covering a considerable range of 
topics. In the first of them he traces the history 
of the horse-shoe, states the superstitions connected 
with it, and discusses the theories regarding their 
origin. While always interesting, the argument 
lacks definiteness and coherence. The other essays 
are : " Fortune and Luck," " Folk-lore of Common 
Salt," " Omens of Sneezing," " Days of Good and 
Evil Omen," " Superstitious Dealings with Ani- 
mals," and " The Luck of Odd Numbers." These 
are uneven in interest and treatment, although all 
of them show diligence in gathering data and some 
originality in treatment. A rather tiresome feature 
of Dr. Lawrence's work is the homily thrown into 
most of his essays, in which he deplores the exist- 
ence of the ideas and superstitions studied. This 
seems an unnecessary regret. A streak of super- 
stition is human : it will last while man lasts. 

A nation which has delighted in 
Dietrich Knickerbocker, and has 

' 

taken to its heart Sleepy Hollow and 
Rip Van Winkle, rather owes it to itself to become 
acquainted with Vondel and his " Lucifer." Look- 
ing back to the Dutch episode in our history, we 
sometimes fail to estimate rightly that vigorous 
people which produced Rembrandt, De Ruyter, Huy- 
gens, and various other noteworthy persons, among 
whom we might mention also Spinoza, since he was 
cast out by his own people. These gained wide 
fame largely because they did not have to trust to 
the feeble powers of speech: pictures, sea-fights, 
pendulums, philosophies, are all independent of lin- 
guistic boundaries. Like Milton, Vondel had the 
courage to write his great poem in his own tongue. 
Mr. Leonard C. Van Noppen has just translated it 
into ours (Vondel's Lucifer : Continental Publishing 
Co.), in a book that deserves mention for a number 
of reasons. It is excellently printed and bound, 
interestingly illustrated, and enriched with an Intro- 
duction by Professor W. H. Carpenter of Columbia, 
an Essay by Dr. G. Kalff of Utrecht, a sketch of 
Vondel's life and times by the author, and also an 
Interpretation of the poem by him. There is, there- 
fore, everything that one would ask for in such a 
book. Or, rather porro unum, we had almost 
forgotten everything that one could ask, provided 
that the translation be good. There is always a 
moment of suspense, in turning to a well-published 
translation, in which we wonder whether it will be 
readable. Mr. Van Noppen has in this matter been 
singularly successful : his translation seems almost 
like an original. We do not mean that it has pre- 
cisely the poetic character of Vondel himself ; that 
would be a risky assertion. But it does have a 
poetic character, it is not obviously a translation, it 
will be read by many, we suspect, without that 
frantic desire to know the original which accom- 
panies the reading of some translations. There is 
much more to say about this book. We would 
gladly speak of the pictures, curious things like old 
wood engravings, by John Aarts. We would gladly 



say a word on the position taken as to Milton's 
poetic relations with Vondel, but the parallel pas- 
sages cited give others a good opportunity to judge. 
We regret also that we have not room for a few 
words of comment on the poem itself, which might 
show that it was just now worth reading. But the 
exigencies of time and space must be our apology 
for merely calling attention to a book that will come 
into relation with a good many lines of reading. 

There are not a few English ladies

and we imagine that " Elizabeth is 
one of them. Further, we believe that Elizabeth 
(rather bored with kaffeeklatches and other German 
festivities) spent most of her time in her garden, and 
there allowed herself to write down things about it 
and herself. Then her friends in England, to whom on 
visits she read select portions, kept saying " Oh, that 
is so charming ! Really, you must publish it "; and 
the result was " Elizabeth and her German Garden " 
(Macmillan). So much is our opinion of course, 
more or less doubtful : more like a fact is it that 
Elizabeth (whoever she may be) had a genuine love 
of flowers and gardens, and a keen appreciation of 
the colors of nature. We are sure that all garden- 
lovers will detect this in her. She may not have known 
very much about flowers probably she did not 
but she appreciated them, and for a rambling sort 
of garden- journal her book is very pleasant. So far 
as the garden is concerned, the author may well 
enough remain impersonal. But her opinions on 
other matters, or rather her mental attitudes, are 
such that it is of interest to know whether she is 
really German or not. If we may judge from the 
book, she is the wife of a man of good family, living 
upon his estate in Pomerania. She speaks of herself 
as a German. But we think it would be unlikely that 
a German girl of fifteen should have the chance to 
fall in love with the parish organist who wore a sur- 
plice on Sundays and a frockcoat and " bowler " 
hat other days, or that a German mother should 
call her children's mixture of German and English 
" Justice tempered with Mercy," or that any Ger- 
man at all should speak of a " German gardening- 
book," a " German Sunday," a " German rose," as 
this lady does, or in general show the same contempt 
for Germany. As an Englishwoman exiled to Ger- 
many, Elizabeth's ideas and ways of thought and 
life are not so very remarkable. But they are not 
uninteresting therefor ; in fact, there is enough in 
them to induce a second reading. 

A really good life of Robert Louis 
Stevenson will find many readers. 
We look forward to its appearance, 
that we may be able to go over the chances and 
triumphs of that life with the help of someone who 
knows ; that we may try to see just the way it was 
that Stevenson's work took shape and was moulded 
into form, to appreciate just the place he filled 
among us, to estimate, it may be, his genius. We

turned to the volume on Stevenson by Margaret 
Moyes Black in the " Famous Scots " series (im- 
ported by Scribner), with the hope of finding some- 
thing which should put us in the right direction. 
A Life need not be long to be useful. A thorough 
knowledge of the facts of your man's life, a keen 
appreciation of his books if he be a man of letters, and 
a matured estimate of his genius, will give motive 
power and character for an interesting narrative, 
which may be very short, as the plan of this series 
requires. Miss Black hardly reaches the ideal of 
such attainment, although she has written a not 
uninte'resting book. There are some minor annoy- 
ances : she almost always speaks of " Mr. Steven- 
son "; she describes his writings as if to people 
quite unfamiliar with them ; and so on. Nor does she 
quite meet one's desire in ease of narration (not to 
demand charm ), or in critical power. One element, 
however, her book does have which we in America 
more than others, perhaps, should value : namely, 
a familiarity with the Edinburgh life of which Stev- 
enson made a part until his health sent him else- 
where. We are apt not to appreciate enough the 
Scottish temper of one whom we are rather inclined 
to think of as a great writer in our own language. 
But here is the intimate and almost unconscious 
familiarity with Edinburgh that is needed to fill 
out our remembrance of Stevenson. Had it noth-

greater degree than Mr. Bradford Torrey. There 
is a delicacy, a humor, a grace in expression, an 
aptness in allusion, and a genial disposition appar- 
ent in his writings which give them a distinctive 
fascination. His latest volume, "A World of 
Green Hills " (Houghton), is an itinerary, in sepa- 
rate yet coherent sketches, of a series of rambles in 
the Southern Alleghanies in quest of birds and 
flowers and mountain scenery. " I sauntered along," 
he . writes, "with frequent interruptions, of course 
(that was part of the game), here for a bird, 
there for a flower, a tree, or a bit of landscape." 
The main object which inspired him was the study 
of the raven, said to be common in the highlands of 
North Carolina. " But ravens or no ravens, I meant 
to enjoy myself," he declares ; and he did enjoy 
everything that came to him with such zest, and 
he tells the story of it with such quiet feeling, that 
the reader becomes an active sharer in his experi- 
ence. Unfortunately, no ravens appeared to crown 
the naturalist's satisfaction ; indeed, " as far as 
ravens were concerned " he carried home " a lean 
bag a brace of interrogation points " only. His 
readers have little occasion to lament this fact, how- 
ever, so abundant are the subjects of his observation 
and so magical is the interest he manages to throw 
around every incident in his adventures. " I relish 



natural country talk," he says, and hence he accosts 
every man and woman and child met on the lonely 
highway, and calls from each by his friendly man- 
ner the best that lay under the rustic exterior, gain- 
ing thereby many a glimpse of a strong and pleasing 
individuality. If Tolstoi's assertion be true, that 
" infection is a sure sign of art," then Mr. Torrey 
is an artist of the finest type, for there is not a page 
in his volume which fails to communicate the subtle 
contagion of his cheerful, tranquil, serious spirit. 



A marvellous 



The first edition of Gesenius's He- 
perpetuation of a brew Grammar appeared in Germany 

Hebrew grammar. in 1813 j t g0()n took itg pos i t i on as a 

standard work, and since the death of the original 
editor has been kept abreast the times, first by Pro- 
fessor Roediger, and afterwards by Professor Emil 
Kautzsch of the University of Halle. This English 
edition was translated by the late Rev. G. W. Collins, 
M.A., from the twenty-fifth German edition, and 
after his death was replenished by the new material 
of the twenty-sixth German edition, by A. E. Cowley, 
M.A., of Oxford. So that the book is now entitled 
" Kautzsch's Gesenius's Hebrew Grammar " (Oxford 
University Press), translated by Collins and Cowley. 
As it now stands, this is the best up-to-date compre- 
hensive Hebrew grammar in existence. The work 
of translating the German into English, never an 
easy task, seems to have been well done, though 
there are some idioms upon which translators can 
never agree. The type of the book is skilfully 
arranged, the larger representing the statements of 
principles, and the smaller the citations of examples 
and their translations. We are somewhat amazed 
to note that the Clarendon Press should not have 
required and published a Hebrew index to a gram- 
mar which it was desired to make as complete as 
possible. This is a serious omission, and detracts 
greatly from the usefulness of a book which the 
student desires as a vade mecum in Hebrew work. 



The seventh volume of the biograph- 
Thackeray ical e( jition of Thackeray (Harper) 

in America. __ _ J ,\, _, ' 

includes " Henry Esmond," " The 
English Humourists," "The Four Georges," and 
the brief essay on " Charity and Humour." The 
introduction, by Mrs. Ritchie, is rather longer than 
usual, with many illustrations, and particularly 
interesting to us because it deals, in part, with 
Thackeray's American lecture tour. He liked Boston 
society, and said that it was " like the society of a 
rich Cathedral-town in England grave and de- 
corous, and very pleasant and well read." He found 
that a man might lecture in America without being 
thought infra dig. He also had this experience : 
"When I came here they told me it was usual for 
lecturers (Mr. B. of London had done it) to call 
upon all the editors of all the papers, hat in hand, 
and ask them to puff my lectures. Says I, 'I'll 

see them all ,' here I used a strong expression, 

which you will find in the Athanasian Creed. Well, 
they were pleased rather than otherwise, and now

the papers are puffing me so as to make me blush." 
Finally, he got very tired of the business (although 
he was to repeat it two years later), and wrote : 
" The idleness of the life is dreary and demoralizing 
all through, and the bore and humiliation of deliv- 
ering these stale old lectures is growing intolerable. 
Why, what a superior heroism is Albert Smith's 
who has ascended Mont Blanc four hundred times ! " 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



In one sense, there cannot be too many translations 
of Homer, yet it is difficult to discover wherein Mr. 
Samuel Butler, in his recent prose version of the " Iliad " 
(Longmans), has improved upon the translation of 
Messrs. Leaf, Lang, and Myers. But Mr. Butler has 
his own ideas about translation, and had a right to give 
them shape. His version is rather freer than others of 
recent making, and he seeks to avoid hackneyed epi- 
thets and phrases. At all events he is better employed 
in this task than in his endeavor to prove that Nausicao 
wrote the " Odyssey." 

The Open Court Publishing Co. has just issued a 
gift-book as beautiful in execution as it is unusual in 
character. It consists of a series of eight colored repro- 
ductions of paintings representing " Scenes in the Life 
of Buddha," the work of Professor Keichyu Yamada of 
Tokyo. These paintings are selected from a series 
made by the artist to illustrate the Japanese translation 
of " The Gospel of Buddha," by Dr. Paul Carus, which 
work is used as a text-book in some of the Buddhist 
schools of Japan. The present reproduction is highly 
successful as to the coloring, which is exceptionally deli- 
cate. Mr. Frederick W. Gookin has designed an appro- 
priate and artistic cover-stamp for this unique volume. 

The collection of " Songs of Life and Nature " (Scott, 
Foresman & Co.) which has been made by Eleanor 
Smith for the use of schools for girls, is a work which 
displays intelligence and good taste in unusual degree. 
Classical selections and folk-songs are interspersed with 
good modern compositions, and the selections are made 
with reference, not only to their musical value, but also 
with regard to the literary value of the texts, the eth- 
ical inspiration to be derived from them, and their fit- 
ness to the general plan of educational work adopted in 
progressive schools.' The book is one to be heartily 
commended. ' 

Mr. M. E. Lowndes is the author of a biographical 
;study of " Michel de Montaigne," which is published at 
the Cambridge University Press (Macinillan). This 
essay embodies the facts unearthed by the researches 
of MM. Payen aud Malvezin, and interprets them in the 
light of the immortal " Essays " themselves. The author 
'is in full sympathy with his subject, and has produced 
what is probably the most readable account existing in 
English of the pleasant egotist whose name this study 
bears. A considerable body of notes supplements the 
text of this monograph. 

Mr. Lorenzo Sears is the author of a treatise, running 
to some three hundred and fifty pages, upon the " Prin- 
ciples and Methods of Literary Criticism " (Putnam). 
The work has grown, we are told, out of " an attempt 
to guide a class in literature in making critical estimates 
of their reading." The subject is dealt with in a care- 
fully classified and logically grouped series of chapters, 



characterized by admirable good sense, but by no strik- 
ing literary excellence. The work is a plain and not 
particularly attractive statement of obvious truths and 
commonplace judgments. It will probably be useful to 
students who are beginning the study of literature. 

Mr. Joseph Shaylor is the compiler of a small book, 
for which Mr. Andrew Lang has penned an introduction, 
which gives a selection of extracts pertinent to the sub- 
ject of " The Pleasures of Literature and the Solace of 
Books " (Truslove & Comba). The work is like Mr. Ire- 
land's " Enchiridion," but planned on a smaller scale, and 
including extracts from many writers too recent to be 
found in that compendium. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are the importers of 
" Sketches and Studies in Italy and Greece," by John 
Addington Symonds. The work is to occupy three vol- 
umes, of which two are now at hand, and will include the 
contents of the three separate works entitled " Sketches 
in Italy and Greece," " Sketches and Studies in Italy," 
and " Italian Byways." Readers of Symonds know 
that these collections comprise much of his most fascin- 
ating and suggestive writing, and will be glad to have 
their contents topographically arranged, as they are now 
to be. 

Long experience in the popular exposition of the 
principles of political economy has given Dr. Edward 
Thomas Devine peculiar qualifications for the prepara- 
tion of a text-book upon this subject, and his recently 
published " Economics " (Macmillan) is an excellent 
book of its sort. While not perhaps the best kind of a 
book for daily use in the schools, it would serve admir- 
ably to supplement some more formal text-book, and 
for this purpose, as well as for the use of the general 
reader, it may be warmly recommended. It is, in the 
main, a treatise readable, lucid, and sound in doctrine. 

Mr. Stopford A. Brooke's " English Literature from 
the Beginning to the Norman Conquest " (Macmillan) 
is essentially a recast of the author's previous work on 
" Early English Literature up to the Days of Alfred." 
The original text has been shortened, rewritten, and 
rearranged, besides being supplemented for the present 
volume by a long chapter on Alfred, and four other 
chapters on the subsequent period. There are many 
translated passages in the text, and a number of others 
in the appendix, where we find " The Wanderer " and 
" The Battle of Maldon." A bibliography is appended. 

Mr. Paul Leicester Ford's edition of " The Writings 
of Thomas Jeiferson" (Putnam) has reached its ninth 
volume, and already draws near the close of the great 
President's life. The correspondence' for the years 
1807-1815 is given in this volume, and we should sup- 
pose that one more volume ought to complete the col- 
lection. Mr. Ford's services to American historical 
scholarship are so many and varied that we hardly need 
to characterize them with every new book that bears 
his name. Possessors of the set now in question will be 
glad to learn that it will soon stand complete upon 
their shelves. 

A revised edition of Professor Edward Channing's 
" Students' History of the United States " (Macmillan), 
with additions taking in the war with Spain, has re- 
cently come to us, and we are once more impressed with 
the admirable character of the book. The recent ten- 
dency to include in the last year of secondary school 
work a serious study of American history cannot fail to 
receive new impetus from the mere fact that such a 
volume as this of Mr. Channing, so suitable for the 
purpose, is to be had.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" Some Notes of a Struggling Genius," by Mr. G. S. 
Street, and " Stories Toto Told Me," by Baron Corvo, 
are two new " Bodley Booklets," published by Mr. John 
Lane. 

Mr. Charles Morris adds a " Spanish " volume to his 
series of " Historical Tales," of which nine volumes have 
previously appeared. The tales are brief, and told in a 
way to be interesting to young people. The Lippincott 
Co. are the publishers. 

Macaulay's essays on Addison and Milton, and Shake- 
speare's " Macbeth," all edited by Mr. Charles W. 
French, form three volumes in a new series of annotated 
English texts published by the Macmillan Co. in a form 
at once tasteful and inexpensive. Tennyson's " Prin- 
cess," edited by Mr. Wilson Farrand, is a fourth volume 
of the same series. 

The American Unitarian Association (25 Beacon 
Street, Boston) has printed for free distribution a pam- 
phlet of twenty-eight pages entitled " A Plea for Sin- 
cerity in Religious Thought," by Rev. Joseph Henry 
Crocker, the author of " Jesus Brought Back," and 
" Problems in American Society." 

" Asheville Pictures and Pencillings " is the title of an 
attractive and novel little booklet published in the famous 
Southern winter resort by Mr. A. H. McQuilkin, editor 
of " The Inland Printer." It is prettily illustrated and 
contains much interesting information, and we hope Mr. 
McQuilkin's intention to issue such a pamphlet fort- 
nightly will be fulfilled. 

" Cuba and Other Verse " is a reprint of a volume 
published pseudonymously several years ago. The au- 
thorship is now acknowledged by Mr. Robert Manners, 
who puts forth this new edition through the press of 
Messrs. Way & Williams in a tasteful book. The con- 
tents, while not in any way remarkable, are not unde- 
serving of attention from readers of poetry. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish Goethe's " Egmont," 
edited by Dr. Max Winkler; " Deutsche Gedichte for 
High Schools," selected by Mr. Hermann Mueller, and 
" The Easiest German Reading for Learners Young or 
Old," prepared by Dr. George Hempl. " Auf der Son- 
nenseite," a selection of stories and sketches from mod- 
ern authors, edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bernhardt, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

The Macmillan Company announces the publication 
in February, under the editorship of Mr. Frank M. 
Chapman, of the first number of a popular bi-monthly 
magazine of ornithology to be known as " Bird Lore." 
The magazine will be the official organ of the Audubon 
Societies for the protection of birds and a department 
devoted to their work will be under the charge of Mrs. 
Mabel Osgood Wright. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. expect to issue at once the 
American edition of " Eighteenth Century Letters," 
under the general editorship of Mr. R. Brimley Johnson. 
The letters of Swift, Addison, and Steele are selected 
and edited with an introduction by Mr. Stanley Lane 
Poole, in one volume, and Mr. George Birkbeck Hill has 
performed the same offices for those of Johnson and 
Lord Chesterfield in another volume. 

"War Poems, 1898," compiled by the California 
Club, comes to us from the Murdock Press of San Fran- 
cisco. There are respectable names in the table of 
contents, Messrs. Clinton Scollard, Marrion Wilcox, 
Robert Burns Wilson, and Theodore C. Williams, Misses 



Ina D. Coolbrith and Edith M. Thomas but the aver- 
age quality of the work is low, to say nothing of the 
average quality of the ideals by which it is inspired. 

There is a rapidly growing literature of protest 
against the expansion madness that has seized upon 
so many normally sane Americans. One by one the 
sober opinions of our really serious thinkers are finding 
voice, and a movement of thought has begun which we 
trust will soon acquire volume enough to save the Re- 
public from the threatened repudiation of its own best 
ideals. Among the recently published utterances of 
conservative scholars upon this all-important subject, we 
note the magnificent address called " American Impe- 
rialism," made early this month by Mr. Carl Schurz 
before the University of Chicago in quarterly Convo- 
cation, and now printed in the "University Record"; 
the fine and scholarly paper of Mr. Charles Francis 
Adams, read on last Forefathers' Day before the Lex- 
ington Historical Society, and now published in pam- 
phlet form by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.; and the 
acute and effective argument of Mr. Edwin Burritt 
Smith, upon the subject of " National Expansion under 
the Constitution," published by the R. R. Donnelly & 
Sons Co. Armed with these three documents, and a 
copy of Senator Hoar's recent speech, the opponent of 
expansion would find himself well equipped for dis- 
cussion.

MATHEMATICAL BOOKS. 
Lectures on Elementary Mathematics. 

By JOSEPH Louis LAGRANGE. Being the Course of Lectures delivered at 
the Ecole Normale, Paris, 1795. Translated from the French by 
THOMAS J. McCoRMACK. A Masterpiece of Mathematical Exposition. 
First Separate Edition in English or French. With a fine photogravure 
portrait of the great mathematician, notes, bibliographical sketch of 
Lagrange, marginal analyses, index, etc.; handsomely bound in red 
cloth, pp. 172. $1.00 net. 

" The book ought to be in the hands of every high-school teacher of 
mathematics in America, for the sake of getting Lagrange'g point of 
view." Prof. HBNBY CREW, Norlhwetlern University, Evanston, III, 

On the Study and Difficulties of Mathematics. 

By AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN. New corrected and annotated edition, with 
references to date, of the work published in 1831, by the Society for 
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. The original is now scarce. 
With a fine portrait of the great mathematical teacher, complete 
index, and bibliographies of modern works on algebra. The Philos- 
ophy of Mathematics, Pangeometry, etc.; pp. viii.+288, cloth, 1.25. 
" A valuable essay." Prof. JBVONS, in the Encyclopedia Briltannica. 
" The mathematical writings of De Morgan can be commended unre- 
servedly." Prof. W. W. BEMAN, University of Michigan. 

Mathematical Essays and Recreations. 

By HERMANN SCHUBERT ; from the German by THOMAS J. McCoRM ACK. 
A collection of six articles bearing the following titles : (1) " The Defi- 
nition and Notion of Number "; (2) " Monism in Arithmetic "; (3) " On 
the Nature of Mathematical Knowledge"; (4) "Magic Squares"; 
(5) " The Fourth Dimension "; (6) " The History of the Squaring of the 
Circle." The first three articles are concerned with the construction of 
arithmetic as a monistic science, all the consequences of which flow as 
a matter of pure logic from a few simple principles. The article on the 
" Fourth Dimension " is popular and shows clearly what is meant by 
" dimension " in science and what the legitimate function of a " fourth 
dimension" is in mathematics; of the claims of spiritualism to this 
beautiful and convenient concept, it disposes definitely. The article on 
" Magic Squares " is a pleasing recreation. That on the " Squaring of 
the Circle " gives the history of one of the most instructive and inter- 
esting episodes in the history of human thought. Both these essays are 
very complete popular accounts of their subjects, more complete per- 
haps than any generally accessible accounts in English. 



RECENT PUBLICATIONS. 
Truth and Error; 

Or, The Science of Intellection. By J. W. POWELL. A new book by the

sometime Director of the United States Geological Survey. Pp. 423,

History of the People of Israel. 

From the Beginning to the Destruction of Jerusalem. By Prof. C. H. 

CORNILL, of the University of Koenigsberg, Germany. Translated by 

W. H. CARRUTH, Professor of German in the University of Kansas. 

Pp. 325, S1.50 (7*. 6<f). 

" Its brevity and clear style make it very readable." Outlook. 

" It is concise and graphic." Congregalionalist. 

" Many attempts have been made since Old Testament criticism set- 
tled down into a science, to write the history of Israel popularly. And 
some of these attempts are highly meritorious, especially Kittel's and 
Kent's. But Cornill has been most successful. His book is smallest 
and it is easiest to read. He has the master faculty of seizing the es- 
sential and passing by the accidental. His style (especially as freely 
translated into English by Professor Carruth of Kansas) is pleasing and 
restful. Nor is be excessively radical. If Isaac and Ishmael are races, 
Abraham is an individual still. And above all, he has a distinct heroic 
faith in the Divine mission of Israel." The Expository Times (London). 

The Prohibited Land. 

The Travels in Tartary, Thibet, and China of MM. Hue and GABET. 

New Edition. From the French. Handsomely bound in Oriental

all times. 2 vols. 100 illustrations, pp. 688, cloth, $2.00 (10*.). 

" To all readers of Mr. Landor's new book who wish to supplement 

the information concerning the Forbidden Land there given, we can 

recommend the work of M. Hue. Time cannot mar the interest of his 

and M. Gabet's daring and successful enterprise." Academy (London).

togravure frontispiece of the traditional picture of Lao-tze, specially 
drawn for the work by an eminent Japanese artist. Appropriately 
bound in yellow and blue, with gilt top. Pp. 345, $3.00. 

"It goes without saying that the task of obtaining sufficient ac- 
quaintance with the Chinese language to translate, under the condi- 
tions named, a book like that of Lao-tze is a gigantic one. Dr. Carus's 
success is little short of marvelous. He frequently cites the versions 
of others, none of which happen to be at hand for comparison, but in 
the extracts given it seems clear that Dr. Cams has succeeded better 
than Dr. Legge or Dr. Chalmers in the passages where we are able to 
compare them a very remarkable fact indeed." Extract from 
Review in North China Daily News. 

A Daring Book. 

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO DARWIN. By Dr. WOODS HUTCH-

Homiletic Essays, treating the Crying Religious and Ethical Problems 
of the Day in the Light of the Revelations of Modern Science. 
Pp. xii.+241, cloth, $1.50 (6*.). 

" Is one of the most thoughtful and stimulating of recent publica- 
tions. In these pages are discussed, in a frank, manly, straightforward 
manner, many of the themes that are most vital to the race. We may 
not agree with all Dr. Hutchinson says, but we cannot deny the fresh- 
ness and vigor of his argument, nor the force of his facts, and we 
shall all find in his pages very much food for profitable meditation." 
The Chicago Chronicle.

" Every detail, as told by Captain Sigsbee, seems to acquire new interest 
and meaning." Portland Times. 

The War with Spain was precipitated by the explosion of the Maine, 
and it is fitting that the memory of so fateful an event should be preserved 
for posterity by the captain of the battle-ship. Captain Sigsbee tells his 
story with a simplicity that emphasizes the impressive facts. While he 
declares his belief that the explosion was external, he does not attempt to 
fasten the act on any individual. A series of appendices presents the find- 
ings of the Court of Inquiry, and there is a list (not before published) of 
the dead and wounded members of the crew of the Maine, showing the 
present location of the remains of such as were identified.

On May 5, 1898, just two weeks after the Spanish- American War broke 
out, Mr. Kennan started for the front as correspondent of " The Outlook." 
The basis of this book is the material which he contributed to that paper, 
with revisions and a great deal of new matter. Mr. Kennan is famous for 
his powers as a descriptive writer, and for his accuracy in gathering facts, 
and all of these qualities are conspicuous in this interesting volume.

No more welcome book could be offered to American readers than the

Carroll's nephew, and made up largely of the letters and diaries of the 
author of " Alice." The book contains many interesting explanations of 
the humor of " Alice," and the illustrations are of extraordinary interest, 
including a number of portraits of Lewis Carroll taken at different ages; 
portraits of his family and of his correspondents and friends Tennyson, 
the Duke of Albany, lluskin, Tom Taylor, George MacDonald, Ellen Terry, 
Sir John Millais all from photographs by Lewis Carroll himself; illus-

Dr. Barry has waited twelve years before following up his first success 
with a new novel. In " The Two Standards " Dr. Barry presents very 
vividly many phases of English social, artistic, and religious life at the 
present time. The characters are strikingly life-like, and the intellectual 
and moral atmosphere of London at the close of the nineteenth century is 
reproduced in his pages with remarkable fidelity.

It is published one hundred years after the invention of lithography, and it

masters of lithography, from the earliest days of the art to the present time, 
add a rare interest and value to its pages. The frontispiece is an original 
lithograph by Whistler, a portrait of Joseph Pennell, and one of the 
pictures is a colored lithographic portrait of Gladstone, drawn by J. McLure 
Hamilton. The edition is limited and orders should be placed early.

Mr. Watson's treatment of history is from a new and entirely modern point of view. The well-known political 
leader says in his Preface that it has been his purpose to lay before his readers " a clear narrative of the gradual 
development of a great people ... to note the varying forms of government, to trace the ancient origins of 
T Id 1 h 1 1 modern laws and customs, to mark the encroachments of absolutism upon popular rights, 

'. r ' to describe the long-continued struggle of the many to throw off the yoke of the few, 
style, unconventional, tQ emphasize the corrupting influence of the union between Church and State; to illus- 
v ** ' * trate once more the blighting effects of superstition, ignorance, blind obedience, unjust 

laws, confiscation under the disguise of unequal taxes, and a systematic plunder year by year of the weaker classes 
by the stronger." The author is in very keen sympathy with the mass of the people, and for the first time we 
have the historical point of view of the laborer and mechanic told in a style that is bold, racy, and unconventional. 
It is a vigorous and democratic presentation of history.

PUERTO RICO AND ITS RESOURCES. 

A Book for Travellers, Investors, and Others, containing full 
accounts of Natural Features and Resources, Products, 
People, Opportunities for Business, etc. By FREDERICK 
A. OBER, author of " Camps in the Caribbees," " Crusoe's 
Island." With maps and illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
"No helter-skelter narrative is this, patched together to catch a 
sudden market in the wake of war, but a careful, well-proportioned 
volume by an author who has seen more and written more of Latin- 
America than almost any other living American. . . . Undoubtedly the 
best book on Puerto Rico yet written, and the likelihood is that it will 
be a long time before we shall get another so good." Boston Journal. 
" An orderly and intelligent account of the island. Mr. Ober's book 
is both timely and trustworthy." New York Evening Post. 

A HISTORY OF JAPANESE LITERATURE. 

By W. G. ASTON, C.M.Q., D.Lit., late Japanese Secretary to 
H. M. Legation, Tokio. A new volume in The Literatures 
of the World Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

f The author begins by defining the individual characteristics of the 
Japanese which have persisted in their literature in spite of the influ- 
ences of Chinese civilization and of Buddhism. His historical treatment 
opens with the songs and Shinto ritual of the archaic period from the 
fifth to the eighth century. It has been an essential part of the author's 
plan to include a very large number of translations of verse and prose 
as illustrations of his discussion of various epochs, tendencies, and 
genres. While Fitzgerald has made Omar Khayyam universally known, 
the Tanka of Otomo in praise of sake 1 which is included among these 
translations, will be new to almost all readers, and it is safe to say that 
the book as a whole will introduce the majority of readers to a compar- 
atively new and fascinating field. 

EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER EARTH 
MOVEMENTS. 

By JOHN MILNE, F.R.S., F.Q.S., late Professor of Mining 
and Geology in the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokio, 
Japan. International Scientific Series. With 38 figures. 
New edition. Entirely reset. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 
By references to the varied and numerous investigations made of 
late years the author has aimed to bring the original subject-matter up 
to date. There are also some new illustrations, a few corrections, and 
a list of reference books, features which enhance the value of this val- 
uable and systematic account of earth movements. 

GENERAL SHERMAN. 

By General M. F. FORCE. A new volume in the Great Com- 
manders Series. Edited by General JAMES GRANT WILSON. 
With portraits and maps. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The author of this volume, a practiced writer and one of Sherman's 
division commanders, accompanied him in the Atlanta campaign and in 
the march to the sea. The book contains a finely engraved steel por- 
trait of the picture that General Sherman preferred, sii well-executed 
maps of his most important battlefields, and a carefully prepared index. 

CANNON AND CAMERA. 

Sea and Land Battles of the Spanish- American War in Cuba, 
Camp Life, and Return of the Soldiers. Described and 
illustrated by J. C. HEMMENT, War Artist at the Front. 
With over one hundred full-page pictures taken by the

THE STORY OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERY. 

By JOSEPH JACOBS. A new volume in the Library of Useful 

Stories. With maps and illustrations. 16mo, cloth, 40 cts. 

This fascinating epitome of discovery will prove a book of universal 

interest. With rare tact and knowledge the author pictures the salient 

phases of geographical discovery in ancient and modern times. The 

field which he covers is a vast one, but his treatment retains the interest 

of the theme. This book is a remarkable and accurate summary of the 

subject, which will be found of general value.

Medical Student," "Fellow Travellers." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" We congratulate the author very heartily upon her success. The 
iharacters are all alive and the conversation suits them. . . . We cor- 
dially recommend ' Windybaugh.' " London Literary World. 

1 The name of the author of ' Mona Maclean ' should assure anyone 
of at least pleasant reading, and ' Windyhaugh ' has a great deal about 
it that is pleasant. The story works itself out well and is the result/ 
uite evidently, of a great deal of thought and care." London Satur- 
'ay Review. 

THE CRUISE OF THE CACHALOT, 

Hound the World after Sperm Whales. By FRANK T. BUL- 
LEN, First Mate. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, 81.50. 
" It is immense there is no other word. I 've never read anything 
that equals it in its deep-sea wonder and mystery, nor do I think that 
any book before has so completely covered the whole business of whale- 
fishing, and at the same time given such real and new sea pictures. I 
congratulate you most heartily. It 's a new world that you 've opened 
the door to." Rudyard Kipling. 

" Mr. Bullen has given us an epic of whaling, and has presented it 
with that forcefulness and simplicity with which the epic is associated. 
. . . The book is of the sea. The author describes some tremendous 
scenes. . . . The book is real, authentic, a piece of life." London 
Academy.

the author's works. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
This new edition will present itself as practically a new book. It 
will be found to differ materially from the edition heretofore published,

revision. This powerful romance and expressive "parable" will be 
certain to obtain a greatly enlarged meed of popularity.

NEW PHASES OF THE ROMANCE. 

When the Wizard of the North laid aside 
his pen and closed his series of romantic fiction, 
the reading world had already accorded him a 
unique place in modern literature. He had 
done for letters a work unequalled in value by 
that of any writer since Shakespeare ; he had 
advanced the historical romance to eminence, 
and shown it to be worthy of discriminating 
criticism. Romance was no longer to be repre- 
sented by " The Castle of Otranto." Scott had 
re-created Romance. 

Nor was current opinion satisfied with con- 
ferring this meed of praise ; there were those 
who felt that so brilliant a genius must have 
exhausted the resources of Romance, and that 
Scott could have no successor. 

This record of Romantic tales began with a 
novel. It was in the life of an era then only 
sixty years past that Scott found the mate- 
rial for his " Waverley." Does it seem incon- 
gruous that his entire series of fiction should 
have come to bear the title of the " Waverley 
Novels " ? It will be remembered that the 
genius for Romance which made him illustrious 
had shown itself in that initial novel. It was 
the romantic element in " Waverley " which 
convinced the reading world that a new era in 
fiction had opened. 

Sixty years have passed since the close of 
that series of romances, and the belief that 
Scott is to have no rival seems to be more and 
more confirmed. Dumas has surpassed and 
others have emulated him in fertility of produc- 
tion. Nevertheless, there is no real rivalry ; 
the charm of the Wizard's style remains his 
own. But Romance does not die ; and though 
Scott stands alone in his chosen field, new op- 
portunities are revealed for the work of the 
romancer, and new achievements crown his 
fertile imagination. Great as was Scott's 
departure from the earlier canons of romantic 
fiction, the romance of the present time exhibits 
even greater departure from the Waverley 
pattern. 

In the old Romance, realism had no proper 
place. The more unreal the events chronicled, 
and the farther removed from the actualities of 
life, the greater the credit to the imagination of 



70

[Feb. 1, 



the romancer. Tried by this standard, " The 
Castle of Otranto " was awarded place and 
fame. As Dr. Johnson said : " In the romance 
formerly written, every transaction and senti- 
ment was so remote from all that passes among 
men, that the reader was in little danger of 
making any application to himself." 

But there is no necessity which compels the 
Imagination to bear false witness in order that 
it may be honored. The modern historical 
romance, by its faithful representations of the 
characters and motives and deeds of past eras, 
has shown the imagination at work in con- 
formity to realistic standards. Scott's followers 
have sedulously observed this essential of their 
art, and truthfulness has become an accepted 
canon of the historical romance. Bulwer's 
" Last Days of Pompeii " and " Last of the 
Barons," and Thackeray's " Henry Esmond " 
and " The Virginians," attest its admitted au- 
thority. 

Hawthorne came, and an avenue was opened 
to new fields for the work of the Romancer. 
The imagination now found its required mate- 
rial in the social life of a new world, a world 
with no history, in which there were no ruins, 
no venerable traditions. The ancient, the un- 
known, the mysterious, the startling, were the 
elements theretofore conceded to be essential to 
romantic fiction. Hawthorne found, in the 
simple life of New England, sufficient of these 
elements to constitute real Romance. Even 
with his exuberant imagination, this was no 
light task, as his own words declare. " No 
author, without a trial, can conceive of the 
difficulty of writing a romance about a country 
where there is no shadow, no antiquity, no 
mystery, no picturesque and gloomy wrong, 
nor anything but a commonplace prosperity, 
in broad and simple daylight, as is happily 
the case with my dear native land." This 
inevitable difficulty, once conquered by Haw- 
thorne, has seemed less formidable to later 
romancers. 

But Hawthorne did even a greater service to 
romantic fiction. In the New England life 
not only of the past, but of to-day, he found the 
elements of romance latent, and brought them 
into play. His quick imagination had flashed 
upon the romantic elements in his own life at 
Brook Farm ; and he employed these and sim- 
ilar features in other personal episodes, in 
weaving for us a tale of modern life, the 
" Blithedale Romance," which has opened up 
for the present age a new phase of romantic 
literature. 



Doubtless some will say that the Romance of 
Real Life is a contradiction in terms, and that 
the Romantic and the Realistic are not only anti- 
thetic but antagonistic. Realism has been well 
exploited in late years, and its disciples seem 
disposed to conquer, and by conquering to con- 
vert the world. The recent novel has been 
almost uniformly realistic, and this is usually 
claimed as its chief merit. George Eliot's 
novels of real life have won her the highest 
rank as a novelist, and the leadership of an 
army of admiring followers ; and " Marcella " 
is pronounced the greatest novel of the realistic 
school since " Middlemarch," entitling its au- 
thor to succeed to George Eliot's honors. 

But even realism as thus expounded fails to 
satisfy some honest critics. A new school 
charges the realists with giving too loose rein 
to fancy, and advocates a fiction so faithfully 
true to actual life that it is to be properly called 
veritism. The imagination is so dangerous a 
steed that it must be effectually curbed and 
bridled ; the truth, the very truth only, must be 
told ; and the realist must confess his failure to 
be exact, and must abandon the field of fiction 
to the veritist. Gradgrind reappears, and again 
insists upon the inestimable value and the prime 
importance of facts. 

At the very time of this exaltation of Real- 
ism, there comes a revival of the Romance. 
We observe not only a renewed feeling among 
authors that this form of fiction has still a 
career before it, and a revived interest in it 
among readers of fiction, but indications also of 
new worlds to be opened to its conquests. 

It should be noted first, that the novelists 
themselves, even the realists, do not despise the 
Romance. George Eliot was not wholly satis- 
fied with depicting real life, and she went back 
to the romantic period in Florentine history for 
her " Romola," a romance which well contends 
with her novels for high place. The romances 
of Thackeray and Bulwer were children of their 
affection, and still find appreciative readers no 
less than their novels. Novelists like Black, 
Hardy, and Besant turn aside from the attrac- 
tions of real life to revel in romance. Charles 
Reade wins more fame by " The Cloister and 
the Hearth " than by any other of his novels, 
and the industrious Mr. Crawford begins his 
career by introducing " Mr. Isaacs," a tale well 
suiting the old definition of romance. 

Again, a new school of writers has appeared, 
who have adopted the historical romance as their 
field, and seek to assure us of its renewed claims 
to our attention. In England, Mr. Stanley

Weyman presents a series of romantic tales, 
founded upon some of the remarkable episodes 
in French history, which improve upon earlier 
efforts in the same class, in illustrating the de- 
velopment of high traits of character under the 
stress of adverse circumstances. In America, 
Mrs. Mary Hartwell Catherwood has felt the 
inspiration of strange episodes in the early 
French occupation of our northern frontier, and 
in her historical sketches has well reinforced 
Hawthorne's testimony to the romantic features 
of the settlement epoch in this country. In the 
conflicts between the English and French civ- 
ilizations on this and another continent, Mr. 
Gilbert Parker has found the materials for more 
extended romances, in relating which he has 
caught the secret of that picturesque presenta- 
tion of situations which suggests more than it 
expresses. Helen Hunt Jackson's " Ramona " 
is, on its literary side, an enthusiastic outburst 
of appreciation of the essentially romantic inci- 
dents attending the American dispossession of 
the Indian holdings in California. Mr. Arthur 
Sherburne Hardy, in his " Passe Rose," takes 
his readers back to the era of Charlemagne, 
amid the adventurous phases of a state of so- 
ciety in which civilization was struggling with 
barbarism. Gen. Lew Wallace found in Mex- 
ican history the material for his " Fair God," 
and in the advent of Christ the inspiration for 
his " Ben Hur." Later, he has felt the fasci- 
nation of the old myth of the Wandering Jew, 
a subject essentially romantic, and one which 
has allured so many romancers ; and in his 
" Prince of India " he has invested this myth- 
ical character with new and engaging attri- 
butes, and has made him an actor in the 
intricacies of that most romantic epoch, the fall 
of Constantinople. 

We have still another school, who aim to show 
us the romantic features of the everyday life 
around us ; who find the romantic in the midst 
of the real ; in a word, who transmute the Novel 
into the Romance. Their tales may or may not 
be labelled romantic, but such is their character. 
Those elements of the adventurous, the marvel- 
lous, or the mysterious, which the romancer is 
accustomed to seek afar off, among groups of 
people little known, or in past epochs, these 
writers find in their own time and among their 
own acquaintance. The marvels of the pre- 
sent day in science, in the arts, in psychology, 
and in occult learning and the dreams of the 
mystic, the ambitions of the philosopher, and 
the schemes of the social reformer, all these 
are proved to have their romantic phases, 



which are illustrated for the reading world of 
to-day. 

Thus, Dr. Holmes, in his " Elsie Venner," 
has pressed medical science into the service of 
the romance. Jules Verne has made free with 
not only the achievements, but also the aims 
and the ambitions, of modern skill in median 
ics and engineering. Dr. Conan Doyle's detec- 
tive stories are, in an eminent degree, what 
Poe's similar efforts already were in a small 
way, studies in the recent accomplishments of 
psychology. Mr. W. H. Mallock has found 
romantic characteristics in the manner in which, 
at this very hour, " The Old Order Changes " 
and a new social fabric takes its place. Charles 
Egbert Craddock's tales of life in the Tennes- 
see mountains would be tiresome indeed, but 
for the subtle manner in which those heights 
breed romantic feelings and sentiments in their 
mountain-dwellers. Mr. Crawford's " Children 
of the King " picturesquely exhibits the essen- 
tially romantic characteristics and experiences 
of life in southern Italy, in our own time. Miss 
Anna Fuller's group of sketches, " Peak and 
Prairie," each but a little dash of color upon a 
bit of canvas, are of similar character, and show 
the romantic features inherent in the ranch and 
mining camp life of Colorado. 

In this new tendency of Romance, we find 
it competing with Realism in its own field. 
The realists, to champion the superiority of the, 
Novel, argue that "truth is stranger than fic- 
tion." But it is the truth that is stranger than 
fiction, in modern life, which furnishes the mate- 
rial for these new exploits in Romance. The ex- 
traordinary, the marvellous, the startling, which 
always distinguished the romantic, were never 
found in chivalric strife, in feudal contests, or 
in internecine warfare, in greater abundance 
or more ready to the cunning hand of the story- 
teller, than they are now in the everyday inci- 
dents of this wonderful era. Now comes Ro- 
mance and says to this age, " I find at your very 
doors, and in your very homes, the warp and 
woof for my web, which I once went so far to 
seek." 

The Possible disputing ground with the Im- 
probable, and pushing it to the rear, this is 
always the basis of the marvellous, this is always 
involved in the romantic as its fundamental 
characteristic. The romancer is an explorer, a 
skirmisher ; he is always on the farther verge 
of neutral ground, always apparently in peril. 
As Hawthorne said of his own work, while 
writing " The House of the Seven Gables ": 
" In writing a romance, a man is always, or 



72

always ought to be, careering on the utmost 
verge of a precipitous absurdity, and the skill 
lies in coming as close as possible without actu- 
ally tumbling over." 

The present age does not cease to startle us 
with new developments, crowding close, one 
upon another, in all fields open to the investi- 
gations of the human intellect. Every day we 
see new territory wrested from the Improbable 
and occupied by the Possible. The Imagina- 
tion does not sleep while the Intellect is at work ; 
and the precipitous absurdity of the romancer 
is daily a step further removed. 

This new field of the romancer's work is that 
upon which Hawthorne ventured in the " Blithe- 
dale Romance." Psychology, with its myste- 
ries so little appreciated, so slightly explored, 
so often quite undiscovered, furnished the basis 
for those elements of the marvellous which 
made that tale a Romance. So wonderful are 
the recent developments in psychology that it 
is but natural that much of the work of the 
modern romancer should take him into the same 
field. It will be remembered that Hawthorne 
in that story anticipated many of the recent 
disclosures in hypnotism. 

So the Romantic has left the realm of tradi- 
tion and myth, and has come to sit down with 
us by the firesides of the Nineteenth Century. 
Distinctions between Realism and Romanti- 
cism are now but definitions ; the old antag- 
onism vanishes. While the Real occupies one 
chimney-corner in our libraries, the Romantic 
is at home in the other. Literature is still One, 
and the Imagination is to remain one of its 
high-priests. It may, doubtless will, have new 
work for Romance to do, such as has never 
before been attempted.

SHAKESPEARE. 



Glad have I drunk of Chaucer's living spring, 

And I have followed Spenser's silver stream 

Through new-awakened meadows; traced the gleam 

Of many fertile rivers issuing: 

In sterner regions I have heard the roll 

Of Milton's torrent harmonies, that sweep 

Reverberating chords through chasms deep; 

And in pure waters I have seen the soul 

Of gentle Keats. But Shakespeare ! Ah, the sea, 

With its great pulses throbbing mightily, 

Bears all the commerce of our human-kind, 

And touches every shore in friendliness. 

A trackless thoroughfare, and measureless 

As the eternal ocean, is that mind.

THE NOTES TO THE CAMBRIDGE TENNYSON. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have delayed asking permission to comment on the 
criticism of the " Cambridge Tennyson," in THE DIAL 
of December 16, partly that I might correspond with 
the writer, and partly that I might reexamine my work 
on the book and find out how far it deserved the un- 
qualified condemnation it had received. One might infer 
from the tone of the criticism that I was a literary 
charlatan whom the writer felt it his duty to show up; 
but he assures me that this was not the case. He says : " I 
was confident all the time, as will all be who know your 
work, that you were the victim of misplaced confidence 
in assistants." It happens that this is true of the poems 
(with one exception) referred to in the criticism; and 
I may add that it is the only instance in which I have 
ever had such assistance in the collation of texts, or, 
indeed, in any work I have done as an editor. 

In collating Tennyson's volumes of 1830 and 1833 at 
the British Museum some years ago, as I had not time 
(to say nothing of the strain upon my eyes in the poor 
light of the reading-room in average English weather) 
to examine all the poems thoroughly, I worked chiefly 
on the longer ones (" The Lady of Shalott," The Mil- 
ler's Daughter," " The Palace of Art," the Dream of 
Fair Women," etc.) in which I was most interested, and 
which had been most altered by the author. After I 
came home I had the collation of the remaining poems 
done by a person recommended for the purpose by the 
Museum authorities. Suspecting some errors in the 
work, I returned it for revision, and, as I remember, 
ten or twelve corrections were made. It appears now 
that there were other errors or omissions which I did 
not suspect, and did not detect when, later, I had the 
loan of copies of the original volumes for a short time; 
but then, as at the Museum, I gave my attention almost 
exclusively to the longer poems; and these, which he 
" had not noted before," Professor Jack tells me he finds 
" substantially correct." I find, after carefully verify- 
ing my notes, that this is also true of " The Princess " 
and " In Memoriam," and I do not doubt that I shall 
find it true of the " Idylls of the King " and the other 
poems that I have studied somewhat thoroughly. 

It should be understood, however, that the book makes 
no pretensions to being a complete " variorum " edition. 
The " Publishers' Note " (which I did not write) states 
that the collation of texts has been limited to the edi- 
tions " accessible " to me, and these (English editions I 
mean) except the very earliest and the latest (from 
1884 to 1898) have been comparatively few. For 
instance, I have never been able to get hold of the edi- 
tion of 1851, in which the lines " To the Queen " first 
appeared. For the reading of the " Crystal Palace " 
stanza I had to depend on quotations in criticisms and 
commentaries, and four of these (Shepherd's " Tenny- 
soniana," second edition, 1879; Wace's Alfred Tenny- 
son," 1881; Luce's "Handbook to Tennyson," 1895; 
and Miss E. L. Gary's " Tennyson," 1898, the only 
authorities accessible to me) give " did meet as friends "; 
and Luce remarks: "The stanza has defects, the exple- 
tive did meet, for example." No authority refers to the 
subsequent insertion of the fourth stanza; and Luce 
distinctly says that the stanzas were " one more in num- 
ber " in 1851 than subsequently, on account of the 
" Crystal Palace " one.

I have found and corrected many errors in Luce, 
Shepherd, and the rest, but this one I did not suspect 
and had no means of correcting. It is a curious ques- 
tion, by the by, how this error originated, since the 
stanza appeared only in the edition of 1851. There is 
no such stanza in the first manuscript version of the 
poem printed by Professor Jones in his " Growth of the 
Idylls," 1895. 

That no complete " variorum " edition was attempted 
by me ought to be clear to any reader of the notes from 
such carefully qualified statements as that on " Mari- 
ana," quoted in the criticism (" The line was changed in 
the printed poem at least as early as 1875.") Professor 
Jack says it is " not correct " for me to assert that " the 
original ' sung i' the pane ' was retained in all the editions 
I have seen down to 1875"; but I include American 
editions (the " authorized " Boston ones only), and one 
now in my possession dated 1856 has that reading, and 
I feel quite sure that it must have been in the edition of 
1875, which has somehow disappeared from my library. 
His statement that it is in " none of the editions be- 
tween 1850 and 1875 " is doubtless true of the English 
editions. 

I was rash in saying, in a number of instances besides 
those pointed out by Professor Jack, that " the only 
changes " in the text are those I mentioned. Having 
found Shepherd and others so often wrong in statements 
of this kind, I ought to have verified them, if possible, 
in every instance. Thus far, however, in my reexam- 
ination of my notes on the minor poems, I have found 
only two or three various readings that seem to me 
worth recording in an edition not intended to be com- 
plete in this respect. These, and any others like them 
which I may detect hereafter, will be duly incor- 
porated in the notes, together with corrections of the 
occasional misprints and other little errors inevitable 
in a first edition. If any reader of THE DIAL dis- 
covers such errors, I shall be grateful for a memoran- 
dum of them. For myself, I have always felt it a duty 
to send authors or publishers information of this kind 
concerning books that I read or use for reference. In 
the last forty years or more I must have sent them 
several thousand such corrections sometimes from 
fifty to a hundred in a single work involving many minute 
details. In my own books I have detected and corrected 
many more misprints and mistakes than have been 
kindly pointed out to me by others ; and finding that 
my literary work, though faithfully done as well as I 
know how, is far from perfect, I learn, in printed re- 
views (of which I write many) to be charitable in crit- 
icising the little shortcomings of others, preferring often 
to call attention to these in a private letter rather than 
in a public journal.

IS POE "REJECTED" IN AMERICA? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Charles Leonard Moore, in his very well-put 
article on " The American Rejection of Poe " in your 
last issue, has, I believe, somewhat overstated his case 
in his eagerness to state it strongly. That Poe is at the 
present day " to a great extent ignored or repudiated " 
by the American public seems to me very questionable, 
instead of unquestionable, as Mr. Moore thinks. In 
proof of this I need only cite the innumerable editions 
of his poems and tales, in every conceivable shape, from 
those in paper covers at five cents a copy to editions de 



luxe at fancy or fabulous prices. If Mr. Moore would 
attempt a collection of even the cheaper editions of Poe, 
I think he would at least modify his point of view. 
Nor have I ever yet examined any reputable volume of 
specimen selections of American prose or verse in which 
he was unrepresented. And is not " The Raven " as 
inevitable in every school " reader " or " speaker " as 
the "Psalm of Life" or "Charge of the Light Bri- 
gade " ? There can also be small doubt that " The 
Raven " and " The Bells " have been recited more dif- 
ferent times by more different " elocutionists " in these 
United States than any other two poems by any other 
American poet. As for the popularity of Poe's prose, 
it may be recalled that not long since a literary period- 
ical offered a prize for the best list of ten short stories 
by American authors, the ten to be selected from those 
receiving the highest number of votes; and in the prize 
list there were two of Poe's tales. 

Mr. Moore is undoubtedly correct in his complaint 
that Poe has never been taken into the heart of his 
native public as, for instance, Longfellow was. But the 
man who " never had an intimate friend," who seemed 
to have a positive genius for alienating friendship, could 
hardly be expected to pose as the intimate of his public 
which has, nevertheless, both critically and popularly 
stamped him a classic and quite sui generis. If the 
acceptance of Poe is in any way doubtful, it is not 
because of the antique Poe legends, not because his 
mastery of technic or imaginative power ever fails of 
appreciation, but because of the apotheosis of the " gro- 
tesque and arabesque," miasmas of the pit and the 
charnel-house, the ghastly light of the baleful planets 
from which the work of Poe the name of Poe may 
never be disassociated. Poe's metier was his of delib- 
erate choice; his atmosphere is of his own creation; 
there is not a breath of plain air in it. The " fascina- 
tion of corruption " was strong upon him, his work 
reeks of it; and it would be strange indeed if Poe the 
man were ever to escape from the atmosphere of Poe 
the artist. The " seeds scattered broadcast " by him 
have brought forth the fleurs du mal whose blossom 
is not the dew-drenched rose with head lifted to the 
sunshine in the garden of the world.

THACKERAY AND THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Apropos of Thackeray's confession, as quoted in a 
current periodical, that the American papers were puff- 
ing him so as to make him blush, in spite of his neglect 
to throw a sop to Cerberus, it may be amusing to re- 
member that the " Boston Courier " in 1853 advised 
its readers that these American lectures of Thackeray's 
were " a mere retailing of old anecdotes, fragments 
without originality or any sense of judgment, containing 
nothing which anybody with a file of old newspapers 
and magazines might not have said." 

Which shows that Cerberus preserves the tradition 
of being many-headed.

iloi PARNELL, IRISH PATRIOT 
NATIONALIST.* 

In one respect Mr. R. Barry O'Brien's inter- 
esting Life of Parnell recalls Dr. Busch's 
" Bismarck ": it leaves with the reader a dis- 
agreeable impression of the man its author 
means to eulogize. We have always thought 
that Mr. Parnell was a patriot in the higher 
and correcter sense of the term, and that his 
extraordinary public career, his " really great 
career," as Mr. Gladstone expressed it, was 
inspired primarily by love of his country and 
the desire to advance what he conceived to be 
her interests ; nor are we yet prepared to sur- 
render that opinion. But the hero of Mr. 
O'Brien's pages, if we have read them aright, 
so far from being actuated mainly by the gen- 
erous emotions which the world rightly asso- 
ciates with patriotism, was spurred primarily 
by a mere fanatical hatred of England, partly 
inherited from his mother and partly grounded 
in his foolish early notion that people " despised 
him because he was an Irishman," and which 
did not have even a rudimentary knowledge of 
Irish history to justify it for, be it said, the 
story of English rule in Ireland, from Strong- 
bow's day down to the Smith O'Brien fiasco in 
the famous cabbage garden at Ballingarry, was 
a sealed book to this man who came within an 
ace of putting an end to it. If hatred for an 
entire nation was ever incarnate in a man, that 
man was Parnell, as our present author por- 
trays him ; nor does Mr. O'Brien, so far as we 
can discern, furnish any evidence of Parnell's 
actually loving anything or anyone barring, 
of course, a notorious and fatal exception in 
the case of the wife of his political associate, 
Captain O'Shea. 

We confess we find it impossible to believe 
that the career of this great parliamentary 
leader, whose genius and persistency brought 
his party within actual view of their political 
Goshen, was mainly prompted by an ignoble 
emotion such as might incite a Kerry peasant 
to fire a rick or shoot a bailiff. A lover of 
England Parnell certainly was not. But his 
course in Parliament, his very policy of obstruc- 
tion, goes to show his faith in the ultimate 
soundness and honesty of the English people, 
and his belief that if, from the forum of the

& Brothers. 



House of Commons, he could once really gain 
the ear of the English electorate the conscience 
of the nation would be roused to the justice of 
the Irish national appeal. Nothing could be 
more untrue than the charge that Parnell was 
a mere sower of discord who loved obstruction 
for its own sake and took a malignant pleasure 
in thwarting the deliberations and blocking the 
business of the House. If Parnell disapproved 
of the rose-water methods of Butt, he also dis- 
approved of the uncouth and brutal methods of 
Biggar from whom, however, he really took 
his cue. His ground idea was, as we have said, 
that the real reason why the Irish question, as 
it presented itself in his day, had not been satis- 
factorily settled was that it had not had a hear- 
ing. To force that question upon the attention 
of the English democracy through constitu- 
tional methods was his plan. Therefore, he in 
effect served notice upon the House of Com- 
mons that until the demands of Ireland had 
been duly heard dhd passed upon no other ques- 
tion whatever should be discussed by it as long 
as he and his colleagues could prevent it. Par- 
nell's attitude has been well illustrated by the 
story of the Eastern woman who, having long 
tried in vain to get a petition to the Sultan, at 
last took her station in the public street with 
her little children, and when the Sultan rode 
that way flung herself in the road before him, 
declaring that he must either listen to her ap- 
peal or trample her and her babes to death 
beneath his horse's hoofs. 

In his concluding chapter Mr. O'Brien quotes 
some interesting statements regarding Parnell 
made by Mr. Gladstone in the course of a spe- 
cial interview in 1890. Asked what it was that 
first attracted his attention to Parnell, Mr. 
Gladstone replied : 

" Parnell was the most remarkable man I ever met. 
I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable 
and most interesting. He was an intellectual phenom- 
enon. He was unlike anyone I ever met. He did 
things and he said things unlike other men. . . . There 
was no one in the House of Commons I would place 
with him. As I have said, he was an intellectual phe- 
nomenon." 

As to Parnell's much debated release from 
Kilmainham, Mr. Gladstone said : 

"... What is this they call it? The Kilmainham 
treaty. How ridiculous ! There was no treaty.* There 
could not be a treaty. Just think what the Habeas 
Corpus Act means. You put a man into gaol on suspi- 



* Mr. Chamberlain, on the contrary, said, when questioned 
on this point : " There was a treaty. And the terms on our 
side were that we should deal with some phases of the land 
question." Parnell's agreement seems to have been that he 
would "slow down the agitation."

cion. You are bound to let him out when the circum- 
stances justifying your suspicion have changed. And 
that was the case with Parnell." 

Replying to the question as to the time when 
his attention was first seriously turned to the 
demand for Home Rule, Mr. Gladstone went 
on to say : 

"... I could not, of course, support Butt's move- 
ment, because it was not a national movement. I had 
no evidence that Ireland was behind it. ParnelFs move- 
ment was very different. It came to this: we granted 
a fuller franchise to Ireland in 1884, and Ireland then 
sent eighty-five members to the Imperial Parliament. 
That settled the question. When the people express 
their determination in that decisive way, you must give 
them what they ask. It would be the same in Scotland. 
I do n't say that Home Rule is necessary for the Scotch. 
But if ever they ask for it, as the Irish have asked for 
it, they must get it. ... The union with Ireland has 
no moral force. It has the force of law, no doubt, but it 
rests on no moral basis. That is the line which I should 
always take, were I an Irishman. That is the line which 
as an Englishman I take now. Ah ! had Parnell lived, 
had there been no divorce proceedings, J do solemnly 
believe there would be a Parliament in Ireland now." 

To Parn ell's admirers, Mr. O'Brien's dra- 
matic account of his fight to retain the lead- 
ership of his party after he had forfeited it 
through his misconduct in the O'Shea matter 
makes painful reading. Mr. Gladstone was 
sufficiently explicit in regard to the course 
Parnell ought to have taken : 

"... I do not say that the private question ought 
to have affected the public movement. What I say is, 
it did affect it, and, having affected it, Parnell was bound 
to go. ... All said it would be impossible for the 
movement to go on with him. ... I think Parnell 
acted badly. I think he ought to have gone right away. 
He would have come back, nothing could have prevented 
him; he would have been as supreme as ever, for he was 
a most extraordinary man. Was he callous to every- 
thing? I never could tell how much he felt, or how 
much he did not feel. He was generally immovable." 

Parnell was originally a poor speaker the 
poorest of speakers. He had a harsh, if strong 
and penetrating, voice, and absolutely no flow 
of words. As time went on he acquired a con- 
cise, effective style of oratory an eloquence 
which consists in saying all that needs to be 
said in the fewest and strongest words. But his 
debut as a speaker, at the time of the Dublin 
election in 1874, was most unpromising. Mr. 
Sullivan describes the scene : 

"... To our dismay, Parnell broke down utterly. 
He faltered, he paused, went on, got confused, and, pale 
with intense but subdued nervous anxiety, caused every- 
one to feel deep sympathy for him. The audience saw 
it all, and cheered him kindly and heartily; but many 
on the platform shook their heads sagely, prophesying 
that if he ever got to Westminster, no matter how long 
he stayed there, he would either be a ' silent member ' 
or be known as ' single-speech Parnell.' " 



Equally unfavorable was the impression made 
by the young candidate upon Mr. O'Connor 
Power. He says : 

" Parnell seemed to me a nice gentlemanly fellow, 
but he was hopelessly ignorant, and seemed to me to 
have no political capacity whatever. He could not speak 
at all. He was hardly able to get up and say, Gen- 
tlemen, I am a candidate for the representation of the 
county of Dublin.' We all listened to him with pain 
while he was on his legs, and felt immensely relieved 
when he sat down. No one ever thought he would cut 
a figure in politics. We thought he would be a respect- 
able mediocrity." 

So much for early promises. It was not long 
before this feeble stammerer acquired the power 
to hold his Irish audiences, great open - air 
meetings, such as had been swept along on the 
torrent of O'Connell's eloquence, hanging upon 
his words, and even to fix the attention of 
the critical and hostile House of Commons 
upon every sentence he uttered. Defeated at 
Dublin in 1874, Parnell was returned at the 
head of the poll for Meath in the following 
year. His maiden speech in Parliament was 
" short, modest, spoken in a thin voice and with 
manifest nervousness "; but it went to the root 
of the business, as he saw it : 

" I trust that England will give to Irishmen the right 
which they claim the right of self-government. Why 
should Ireland be treated as a geographical fragment of 
England, as I heard an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer 
call her some time ago ? Ireland is not a geographical 
fragment. She is a nation." 

Parnell has at least one claim upon the re- 
gard of the entire American nation. He was 
opposed to what was known as the " dynamite 
policy " a crude and murderous scheme based 
on the childish notion that England could be 
terrified into granting Irish demands by ex- 
ploding dynamite in the streets of London. 
That such a plan was hatched, fostered, and 
allowed to be publicly advocated in the press 
and from the platform in this country would 
have been a burning disgrace to us were it not 
for the fact that American humor refused to 
take the vaporings of the " professional patriot " 
seriously. He was regarded as a " blather- 
skite," a passing nuisance that could easily be 
abated when he grew too offensive, and politi- 
cians cynically stooped to humor his vagaries 
when they wanted his vote. His real objective 
was believed to be, not Irish freedom, but Irish 
pocket-books ; and so the law left Irish morality 
and Irish good sense to deal with him. Mr. 
Parnell, we are sorry to say, appears to have 
opposed the dynamitard line of action more on 
the ground of its impolicy than of its odious 
and cowardly criminality. He knew the iron

temper of England well enough to see that 
nothing would be more certain to turn back 
the hands of the clock of Home Rule than the 
detestable methods of the "outrage men" 
methods which would be far more likely to land 
him and his friends in an English jail than in 
the coveted national " Parliament on College 
Green." Therefore, while his native caution 
and his conviction of the necessity of keeping 
the various Irish political clans and sections 
" pulling together " prompted him to keep in 
touch so far as possible with them all, he did 
not (as Mr. O'Brien states) " conceal his pri- 
vate repugnance to the methods of the Amer- 
ican extremists. He spoke of Ford and Finerty 
as d d fools." Mr. Parnell's epithet is not 
just the one Americans are commonly accus- 
tomed to use in the case. 

Mr. O'Brien has given us a good and an ex- 
tremely readable biography, as well as a fairly 
comprehensive account, largely from the inside, 
of the political movement to which Parnell 
gave his life, and which now seems to be, if an 
American may be permitted to say so, percepti- 
bly and happily on the wane. It appears not 
improbable that in the course of time and 
through the exercise of wise and liberal states- 
manship Ireland may come to rest under the 
Union as contentedly and with as little sense of 
racial degradation as Scotland does. To that 
end a consummation, as we venture to think, 
devoutly to be wished Parnell, though his 
aim was otherwise, will have materially con- 
tributed. For it was he, more than any other 
Irish party leader, who roused England to the 
necessity of devising a more rational and right- 
eous remedy for Irish unrest than perpetual 
coercion. E. G. J. 



A TIMELT POLITICAL, TONIC.* 

Now that the election is long over and the 
Governors and other servants of the people 
have sworn to do their duty, one may turn again 
to Mr. Chapman's account of the state of things 
here in America, with a mind more unbiassed 
than was probable when the book was pub- 
lished. " Causes and Consequences " is a book 
that had certain relations to the politics of 
New York and of the city of New York. It 
was begun, says the author, " in an attempt to 
explain an election," namely, the first municipal 
election in Greater New York under the new

charter, in which Mr. Seth Low, on an Inde- 
pendent ticket, was defeated. It was published 
on the eve of the last state campaign, in 
which Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, who had by 
many been regarded as the obvious Independ- 
ent candidate, refused the Independent nom- 
ination for governor and was elected on the 
Republican ticket. Its particular relation to 
the campaign lies in the fact that Mr. Chapman 
was one of the Independents who offered Col- 
onel Roosevelt the nomination, and who, when 
the nomination was refused, helped to put an 
Independent ticket into the field. During the 
campaign, then, anyone who knew something of 
the conditions that gave rise to the book was 
likely to be especially interested on one side or 
the other, and thus the book was probably 
prejudged by many. Now that the election is 
long past, there will be less prejudice. 

Further, however, it is well enough to know 
something of these things before reading Mr. 
Chapman's book, not because the politics of 
New York are necessarily of singular import- 
ance to the rest of the Union, but because we 
are thereby assured that we have here the pro- 
duction of a man practically acquainted with 
what he is writing about. It does not follow 
from a man's being practically acquainted with 
anything that he knows all about it in any large 
and intelligent way the reverse is often enough 
the case ; and it does not follow from the fact 
that Mr. Chapman has had his hand in poli- 
tics that the nation should be led by his views 
any more than by the views of any district 
leader or state boss. The importance of the 
matter lies in the fact that we thus have here, 
not the product of scholarly seclusion nor of 
club conversation, but of actual daily activity. 
And such an origin gives reality to a work. 
Doubtless the especial kind of activity will not 
by some readers be esteemed much more prac- 
tical than the intellectual activity of the aca- 
demic theorist or the linguistic activity of the 
man in the smoking-room. But on the whole 
it is more practical. If I, for instance, should 
write a book on American politics, I should feel 
the want of all that stored-up result of absolute 
everyday impression that Mr. Chapman pos- 
sesses. We should, therefore, consider his book 
as expert testimony, recollecting all the time 
the way expert testimony should be considered. 

Mr. Chapman's book is the statement of what 
will be the character of the reformation of 
American public life. The book and its author 
will be variously regarded. Some will think of 
Mr. Chapman as wearing a white plume and

bearing an oriflamme of war. Others will regard 
him as the leader of a forlorn hope, and will 
expect only after a long time to find his body 
by the wall of the fallen fort. Others still will 
consider him a sort of Richard Harding Davis in 
politics. But none of these figures exactly suits 
the case. In fact, it is better to get the matter 
out of politics for the moment, to consider the 
book only. So here are some very simple im- 
pressions, put down, as nearly as I can manage, 
in the order in which they occurred to me. 

In the first place, the book is eminently 
interesting, a matter that might, perhaps, 
have been expected. I am not so sure of that, 
though : books on political and social conditions 
rarely attract lay readers unless their main ideas 
are distinctly popular. Now, the fundamental 
idea of this book is not at all popular : it is, on 
the other hand, a little recondite, I should say. 
Yet the book is so well written, it is so clearly 
the natural and current expression of the work- 
ing of a brilliant mind, that almost of necessity 
it starts up that counter-working in the mind of 
the reader which we call " interest." Mr. Chap- 
man's style is by this time well enough known : 
it is naturally effervescing, or perhaps we should 
say fermenting. It is true also that it is Emer- 
sonian ; but that is probably an accident. 

So much occurs to one who reads along in 
the book, through Mr. Chapman's account of 
present politics and of social life. Next comes 
the essay on Education ; and this essay I take 
to be cardinal to the book. It is a development 
of the principles of Froebel on which the Kin- 
dergarten is based. Mr. Chapman employed a 
governess for his children. " After a couple of 
months," says he, " I discovered that it was I 
who was being educated." He is pretty sure 
that anyone else who gets hold of these ideas 
will be educated, too. Of one of them he re- 
marks that " the consequences of a belief in it 
are so tremendous, that no man who is not pre- 
pared to spend his life completely dominated 
by the idea, ought even to pause to consider it." 
As to the value of these ideas, as to the sound- 
ness of Mr. Chapman's exposition of them, I 
shall not make even an effort to decide, much 
less to make any statement. I will, however, 
indulge myself so far as to make one remark. 
The influence of action upon belief is, I sup- 
pose, unquestionable. Mr. Chapman, for in- 
stance, writes well because he realizes his idea ; 
and he realizes his idea because it has taken 
form through action. But why did he act thus 
and so? Not, I imagine, from accident, but 
from belief. And whence that belief? from 



previous action only ? and so on back ? That 
must land in chance somewhere. 

Now, I have, on the whole, thought it prob- 
able that a man's action was as often the result 
as the cause of his belief. Mr. Chapman would 
perhaps say that this is because I am a logician, 
a professor of rhetoric, a student, a theorizer, 
a doctrinaire, one who fancies that an idea is a 
definite something that may be dropped into 
the mind, much as a little medicine may be 
dropped into a glass of water, or, rather, a tonic 
into a person. Well, it is true that I am all 
those things more or less, and doubtless that is 
one reason why I prefer to wander with Plato. 

But why this trouble as to which comes first, 
idea or act? Because Mr. Chapman would seem 
to infer from his view that right action (spon- 
taneously induced, pefhaps, or perhaps from 
right example) will bring about a right dispo- 
sition here in America, and particularly that 
action in reform movements will give us all 
such a feeling about Democracy that the United 
States will become really what she now is only 
potentially. That is his theory, as far as I can 
see. He shows that politics is debased through 
selfishness encouraged by commerce ; he shows 
that society is debased by the low tone of pol- 
itics. Then he propounds the great truth that, 
to be, men must do ; and also that they must do 
for others, and not only that they must do so, but 
that they want to do so, and that they do do so. 
This is the constant tendency ; commercialism 
is temporary and will pass away. Men will be 
brought to right action by (among other things) 
reform movements. More and more will people 
learn to act in politics unselfishly, and thus they 
will become individualized and independent, 
and the nation as a whole will be purified. 

This rather puts the boot on the other leg : 
Mr. Chapman is now the logician and all the

Why should we have right action ? " Let it 
take care of itself," Mr. Chapman seems to say ; 
" people prefer to be unselfish ; they will insist 
on being so ; they can 't help it in the long run." 
That is to some degree true. Still, people will 
be a little better for good advice in the matter 
of government as in other matters. 

For it is worth noting that Mr. Chapman 
seems to regard government almost as an end 
in itself. He says : " Here is the American 
people ill-governed. It is a shameful thing. 
But by a certain means the American people 
will surely be so toned up that they will govern 
themselves well. Then it will be all right." 
Mr. Chapman believes " a virtuous ruler to be

the prototype of all possible human fulfilment." 
Now, of course every man thinks that his own 
trade is the most important. The schoolmaster 
says that education is the panacea. The clergy- 
man says that religion will reconstitute society. 
The politician thinks that government is the 
main thing. Mr. Chapman likes good govern- 
ment : he agrees with the poet (may for aught 
I know be the poet) who sings : 

" Tilings are there that I wish and I mast have 
Will have them for they suit me. It 's my whim. 
A decent class of men in public life, 
Some tolerably honest courts of law, 
A friend or two that would not steal a watch, 
And above all a riot of free speech 
Where every man may revel to his fill 
And not be hounded for a lunatic." 

Those are good things, to be sure ; but there 
are other things more satisfying to me, and in 
reading the book I could n't help thinking : 
'* This government is only machinery, after all. 
If the government only is improved, people will 
go wrong in other ways. If the whole plane of 
living is lifted up, government is merely a de- 
tail." It is true that something like this may 
be said to everybody who tries to better man- 
kind in some special direction. I rather think 
it cannot be said of what may be called the 
fourth dimensional method, which works in a 
direction quite unperceivable to most of us. 

But I had no intention of going so far in 
criticism. The idea that in a couple of columns 
you can criticize fairly and fully what a man 
^has thought out and expressed in two hundred 
pages, arouses little enthusiasm in me. I do n't 
feel that there is a fair show for either. Nor 
would I try to summarize the book, for that 
might make people think that they knew what 
was in it without a reading. It must be enough 
if I have given something of an idea as to the 
kind of book it is. Then those who like that 
kind will go and read it, and, it may be 
added, they will find it very entertaining and 
also beneficial. EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



THE SUCCESSORS OF HOMER.* 

Professor Lawton's little volume on " The 
Successors of Homer," a companion and sequel 
to his " Art and Humanity in Homer," offers 
the English student an untechnical and very 
readable survey of the remains of Greek hexa- 
meter poetry outside of the two great epics. 
In successive chapters he treats of the lost epics 
of the " Cycle," the Works and Days and Theo- 

*THE SUCCESSORS OF HOMER. By W. C. Lawton. New 
York : The Macmillan Co. 



gony of Hesiod, the so-called Homeric Hymns, 
and the hexameters of the pre-Socratic philo- 
sophical poets Parmenides and Empedocles. 

Professor Lawton is right in claiming a cer- 
tain unity for his theme, whether we find that 
unity in the metre, the prolongation and grad- 
ual decay of the epic tradition, or the conven- 
ience of the modern student. The epic Cycle is 
discussed in Lang's " Homer and the Epic." 
There is a fair account of Hesiod in Black- 
wood's Ancient Classics, and there are excel- 
lent short chapters on him in Jebb and Sy- 
monds. The Hymn to Demeter is the theme 
of one of Walter Pater's fascinating studies, 
and is enthusiastically interpreted in Professor 
Dyer's " Gods in Greece." The Hymn to 
Homer is accessible in Shelley's delicious trans- 
lation. But there is no one work in English 
so well adapted as the one before us to bridge 
over for the general reader and young student 
the gap between Homer and the lyric and 
dramatic poetry of Greece. 

Professor Lawton's method resembles that of 
the well-known " Ancient Classics for English 
Readers," and is for its purpose more effective 
than a more pretentious and less direct way of 
approach would be. The reader who desires 
information about books which he cannot study 
in the original tongue does not want a double 
distillation of subtle critical epithets. He wishes 
to get at the content of the books with as little 
hindrance as possible from the scholastic and 
critical scaffoldings that have been built up 
about them. This want Professor Lawton 
meets by translating in the metre of the orig- 
inal all the more beautiful or significant pas- 
sages. The translations are prefaced or accom- 
panied by just enough prologue and commentary 
to make them intelligible, and connected by a 
running summary of the duller or more tech- 
nical omitted passages. 

These translations bring up again the eternal 
question of the English hexameter. We may 
say at once that we like Professor Lawton's 
hexameters here better than in his Homer. The 
English hexameter, except as an occasional ex- 
periment in the hands of a great poet, not only 
fails to satisfy a nice ear but is fatally lacking 
in distinction. Such a line, for example, as 

" Zeus, 
Who as he sits with Themis engages in chat confidential," 

may pass in a Homeric Hymn. In the Iliad 
it would be intolerable. Professor Lawton, of 
course, has better lines than this. It would be 
a very sensitive ear indeed that felt a jar in the 
description of Apollo,

"Stepping graceful and high, and the splendor glimmers 

about him, 
Flash of the gleaming feet, and of garments cunningly woven." 

And when the critic has said his worst, it re- 
mains true that the line-for-line translation in 
the measure, if not quite the metre, of the orig- 
inal, conveys a truer average impression than 
could easily be given in any other way. What, 
for example, could be done in English rhyme 
or iambic blank verse with such lines as : 

" Glaukonome, who in laughter delights, and Pontoporeia, 
Leiagore and Euagore and Laomedeia " ? 

At the close of each chapter, Professor Law- 
ton gives brief references to the chief German 
authorities. The commentary is enlivened by 
modern touches and a few poetic parallels. We 
miss an allusion to the beautiful imitation of 
the Hesiodic prologue found in Matthew Ar- 
nold's " Empedocles." Schiller's line, 

" Patroclus liegt hegraben und Thersites kommt zuriick," 

proves not so much ignorance of the Aethiopis 
as acquaintance with Sophocles's Philoctetes,

A DISTINGUISHED WORKER FOR THE 

INSANE.* 



Pliny Earle was born in 1809 that annus 
mirdbilis so prolific in great men the world 
over ; and in his field, which was a restricted 
one, his talents were great, while, if he had not 
genius, he had the industry and power of taking 
pains, which, we are told, are of the essence of 
genius. He did not have a great part to play, 
yet he was as remarkable in his field as many 
of the great men of 1809 were in their larger 
fields. It was in work among and for the insane 
that the significance of Dr. Earle's life lay ; yet 
there are many scenes and episodes related in 
his memoirs which have an interest and a charm 
for every reader. 

Pliny Earle was of Quaker parentage, being 
descended from Ralph Earle, one of the found- 
ers of Rhode Island ; and through life he main- 
tained the best characteristics and traditions of 
the Society of Friends, though, apparently, not 
formally adhering to that communion. His 
early travels in Europe brought him into con- 
tact, in both England and France, with many 
of the makers of Quaker history, and many 
other men and women who left their impress 
on their time, and the reception he had from

them was in itself a tribute to great personal 
excellence and attractiveness. There is some- 
thing most refreshing in the account of these 
European travels at a period (1839) when Eu- 
rope would seem to have been more interesting 
to the tourist than it is now. The pictures given 
in this book of the official life in Washington 
during the administrations of Pierce, Buchanan, 
and Lincoln, and of social scenes in Washington 
and Charleston, are also most interesting. To 
read at one's ease to-day about being " jammed " 
through the various colored rooms of the White 
House at the official receptions in the days of 
crinoline mingled with Republican simplicity 
not to say rudeness is more amusing than 
the actual experience could have been ; for Dr. 
Earle tells of seeing people go and come by 
jumping through the windows, and of a foreign 
Ambassador and his lady climbing over piles 
of coats when an effective blockade of humanity 
barred all the doors, at a reception of President 
Pierce. 

Again, the accounts of the trip to Cuba in 
1852, and of the visit to Havana, Cardenas, and 
Matanzas, have an especial interest in the light 
of more recent events. Dr. Earle found Cuba 
most attractive as it was then in its brief hey- 
day of prosperity. Incidentally, one learns with 
interest that President Polk made an offer to 
Spain of $100,000,000 for the island now so 
disastrously lost to her. 

Dr. Earle was" brought during his visit to 
England into immediate contact, as a Quaker 
and the guest of Quakers, with the work done 
for the insane by the Tuke family of York, the 
founders of the York Retreat. The work of 
this family for three generations, but especially 
of William Tuke in 1790 to 1800, forms as 
famous an historical landmark of philanthropy 
in England as does Pinel's universally ap- 
plauded contemporary heroism in France, in 
being the first to remove, and at his personal 
risk, the chains from the mad men and women 
who had worn them for years in the " bedlams " 
of Paris, the Bicetre and Salpetriere. Dr. 
Earle met Samuel Tuke, a son of William ; 
and in becoming familiar with the progress 
wrought at the York Retreat he no doubt de- 
rived inspiration further intensifying his inter- 
est in the insane, and leading him later not only 
to oppose the abuses of mechanical restraint 
in caring for these unfortunates, but also to 
speak and write against the scarcely less abhor- 
rent " chemical " restraint by use of nauseating 
and narcotizing drugs, and also of blood-letting, 
which, under the teachings of Rush, the leading

American authority at this time in the treat- 
ment of insanity, was commonly practiced. 

Dr. Earle met Elizabeth Fry, Fowell Bux- 
ton, and other famous Quakers and philan- 
thropists in England. He visited institutions 
for the insane in England, Ireland, Germany, 
France, Turkey, and even the Island of Malta. 
In the Turkish asylum, hard by the Mosque of 
Suleiman at Constantinople, he found the un- 
happy insane with chains round their necks to 
the number of over thirty. All, indeed, were 
chained but one, and that one was securely 
locked up because he had so often broken his 
chains. This seems barbarous now ; but it 
does not mean that Turkey was more barbarous 
than other countries in that day, for barbarity 
toward the insane was then well-nigh universal. 
Nothing was attempted for any of the insane 
except those dangerous to life and limb, and in 
Turkey mild cases were looked upon as sacred 
objects. Even in civilized Paris, a worse abuse 
than chains was practiced, or authorized, in the 
Bicetre, by the son of the illustrious friend of 
the insane, Pinel. Here patients affected with 
delusions, or neglectful of their tasks, were 
fastened in bath-tubs with covers over the tops 
through which their heads projected, and if 
they insisted upon their delusions or were other- 
wise intractable, the cold-water douche was 
thrown upon them until they would deny their 
delusions or promise to perform what was re- 
quired of them. 

In 1840, shortly after his return home, Dr. 
Earle was engaged to care for the institution of 
the Friends at Frankford, Pennsylvania. This 
was not a " lunatic asylum," as such establish- 
ments were generally called in that day, but a 
" Retreat for Persons deprived of the Use of 
their Reason." Here he had an invaluable 
experience, preparing him well for the larger 
work to which he was called in 1847, when he 
took charge of the Bloomingdale Asylum, the 
department for the insane of the Hospital of 
the City of New York. His five years' service 
at this latter place where he saw and de- 
scribed the first case of " paresis " brought to 
light in America, which malady has become so 
common since was marked by noteworthy 
labors and researches. After resigning from 
Bloomingdale, Dr. Earle engaged in studies, 
travels, practice, and work as an expert on 
insanity cases, for the years from 1849 to 1864, 
and spent much time at the Government Hos- 
pital for the Insane, having charge of a portion 
of the work, and meeting with many remarka- 
ble experiences in the development of this 



institution which received and cared for all the 
insane of the army and navy. Here he met 
many of the famous officials, legislators, and 
persons of scientific and social distinction 
abounding in Washington at this period. It is 
in this portion of the book that we get some of 
the cleverest touches of nature and interesting 
side-lights on historical times and persons. In 
1864 Dr. Earle was made the head of the State 
Asylum for the Insane at Northampton, Mass., 
and there he spent twenty-one years of rare 
usefulness and renown. 

Dr. Earle is presented to us in the portrai- 
ture of his biographer as a man with few fail- 
ings. Mr. Sanborn is not like some biographers 
who have the air of saying throughout their 
work, " Oh, how good ! " He does not seem to 
unduly exalt his hero, but gives us, as a rule, 
an exceptionally sedate and sober-minded por- 
trayal ; hence, a letter incorporated in the 
Washington reminiscences, from Dr. Godding, 
an associate of Dr. Earle at the Government 
Hospital for the Insane, which refreshingly 
shows some of the human foibles of our subject, 
is especially interesting. Dr. Godding tells us 
that the renowned alienist chewed tobacco, and 
that he endeavored for some time to leave off 
by weighing out a few grains less daily, but 
finally desisted ; also that he hated inordinately 
to be beaten at any game of skill or hazard. 
We also learn in another connection that Dr. 
Earle was a punster, and a depraved one at 
that. This, and the laconic way of telling of 
some unseemly things in Cuba like a cocking 
main, a bull-baiting, or Sunday festivities by 
saying, " My barber related these things," or, 
" A man who was in Europe when I was saw 
so and so" (meaning himself), these, as I 
said, are pleasingly humorous touches. 

We have not left ourselves space to speak of 
Dr. Earle's great work at Northampton, where 
he introduced economy, order, industry, com- 
fort, enjoyment, and beauty into the work of 
caring for the insane, and made an establish- 
ment famous the world over. Dr. Earle was 
the first to introduce lectures and readings be- 
fore the insane ; he even lectured to them upon 
insanity with interest and advantage. He was 
also the first to occupy a chair of psychiatry in 
a medical school in the United States. 

Dr. Earle could hardly have had a better 
biographer than Mr. Sanborn, whose biog- 
raphies of Emerson, John Brown, and others, 
are so well known. The material is handled 
with excellent judgment, and from his abound- 
ing stores of knowledge he gives us many side-

lights, not to speak of digressions into scarcely 
related fields. The virtues of a biographer and 
those of his subject are so different that we 
may often see very interesting lives rendered 
dull, vicious lives made saintly, charming lives 
divested of every attraction, and simple lives 
made complex ; and one does not wonder that 
Thackeray left commands that no biography 
of him should be prepared, to inform, or mis- 
inform, coming generations. Mr. Sanborn's 
book may be commended to all who are inter- 
ested in social, industrial and educational con- 
ditions during the middle third of our century, 
and especially to philanthropists and others who 
wish to follow the development of men and 
institutions devoted to the care of the insane 
during the same period at home and abroad. 

RICHARD DEWEY. 



BOOKS ABOUT DANTE.* 



Matthew Arnold, in an address made upon 
the occasion of the unveiling of the Milton 
Memorial Window in St. Margaret's Church, 
Westminster, made the following weighty sug- 
gestion : 

" In our race there are thousands of readers, pres- 
ently there will be millions, who know not a word of 
Greek and Latin, and will never learn those languages. 
If this host of readers are ever to gain any sense of the 
power and charm of the great poets of antiquity, their 
way to gain it is not through translations of the ancients, 
but through the original poetry of Milton, who has the 
like power and charm, because he has the like great 
style." 

We call this a weighty saying, because it points 
out a path whereby the education of the future, 
accepting as inevitable the relegation of clas- 
sical studies to a band of scholars growing ever 
smaller and smaller in their proportion to the 
whole body of educated men, may yet remain 
possessed of a key to unlock the doors of a cul- 
ture not wholly different in kind from that hith- 
erto chiefly obtainable by the study of Homer 
and Sophocles, of Horace and Virgil. Now, 
there is one other modern poet, and only one, 
who may in this respect be ranked with Milton,

and who offers in addition the great advantage 
of being approachable only through the medium 
of a foreign language. It is almost needless 
to add that this poet is Dante, or to say that a 
student bent upon attaining the special type of 
culture known as " classical," yet determined 
to get it through the modern rather than through 
the ancient languages through the tongues 
that are still spoken rather than through the 
tongues that are no longer heard can most 
nearly accomplish his purpose by devoting him- 
self to the works of the immortal Florentine. 
The substitute will not be an an exact one, for 
the spirit of medievalism is not the spirit of 
classical antiquity, but it is a closer substitute 
than most people imagine, and Arnold's plea 
for the study of Milton applies with twofold 
force to the study of Dante. 

It is, then, with much satisfaction that we 
note the signs, multiplying upon every hand, 
of the growing hold of Dante upon the world 
of modern culture, and especially of the increase 
of interest with which the study of this poet is 
being pursued in England and America. Re- 
viewing Mr. T. W. Koch's " Dante in Amer- 
ica," a year or two ago, we commented upon the 
American phase of Dante studies, and we are 
now called upon to give a brief account of sev- 
eral Dante publications that have recently come 
from the other side of the Atlantic. Foremost 
in importance among them is the " Dante Dic- 
tionary " of Mr. Paget Toynbee, a work fore- 
shadowed by the index of " nomi propri e cose 
notabili" prepared by Mr. Toynbee for Dr. 
Moore's " Oxford " Dante, and now expanded 
from the few pages which it occupied in that 
work to the dimensions of a quarto volume. 
The amount of industry that has gone to the 
making of this book, henceforth an indispens- 
able adjunct to the labors of every student of 
Dante and his period, is something enormous. 
Besides the 565 double-columned pages of the 
" Dictionary " proper, there are about fifty 
more of tables, genealogies, plates, indexes, and 
the like. The articles average several to the 
page, and include not only the proper names 
occurring in Dante, but also such miscellaneous 
subjects as " Rosa celestiale," " Carnali pec- 
catori," " Imperio Romano," as well as the 
titles of all the books mentioned in the works 
of the poet. The material has been brought 
together from the most varied sources, includ- 
ing the scattered Dante literature found in 
periodicals. The " Vocabolario Dantesco " of 
Blanc suggested the " Dictionary," which, how- 
ever, differs from the former work in its restric-

[Feb. 1, 



tion to the matters described by the title, while, 
on the other hand, it is not confined to the 
" Divina Commedia " alone. We note, in pass- 
ing, that Mr. Toynbee is now engaged upon the 
preparation of a " Dante Vocabulary " of his 
own. Together with Mr. Fay's " Concordance," 
and the " Enciclopedia Dantesca " of Herr 
Scartazzini (the latter now in course of publi- 
cation), the new " Dictionary " takes its place 
among the half-dozen of reference works abso- 
lutely indispensable to the student of Dante. 

Mr. Edmund Gardner's " Dante's Ten 
Heavens " is a running commentary upon the 
" Paradiso," with a supplementary chapter de- 
voted to the " Epistolae." We are particularly 
glad to find, in the publication of this and other 
recent works, an increasing attention given to 
that section of the Sacred Poem which has suf- 
fered the most from neglect. While the best 
students and critics have never failed to appre- 
ciate the ineffable beauty of the " Paradiso," 
there is no doubt that the general reader has 
come to be more familiar with the first two 
cantiche* or with the first alone, than with the 
third. We still meet with the curious opinion 
that Dante's essential characteristics were 
cruelty and vindictiveness ; we still find, even 
among spiritually-minded people, a lack of 
sympathetic understanding of the poet only to 
be accounted for by their undue attention to 
the more lurid and forbidding aspects of the 
" Inferno." That Dante, so far from being cruel 
by nature, was the very soul of tenderness, and 
that his alleged vindictiveness is in truth a 
quality so far removed from that base passion 
that it is in reality a revelation of the justice of 
God made through the utterance of an inspired 
spokesman, if such there ever were, are propo- 
sitions so self-evident to all who have penetrated 
into the secret chambers of the poet's conscious- 
ness that one almost scorns to support them by 
argument. The vulgar view of this matter is 
akin to the self-revelation of those who charac- 
terize Othello as jealous, unconscious of the 
fact that they thereby place themselves upon 
the moral level of lago, to whom, indeed, the 
noble Moor is but a man of like passions to 
his own. A reverent study of the whole of 
Dante is the best corrective of the grotesque 
popular judgment, and such books as this of 
Mr. Gardner are exceedingly helpful to the 
student who is in good earnest desirous of en- 
tering into communion with the loftiest of poets. 
The author's attitude toward his subject is 
expressed in the following passage : " Here, 
perhaps more than in any other part of the 



poem, does Dante show himself in thorough 
sympathy with his age, its doctrines and rudi- 
mentary science, its yearning for knowledge, its 
delight in the beauty of intellectual satisfaction. 
It is such works as the ' Paradiso ' that enable 
us to realise what were the noblest thoughts 
and aspirations of those ages whose exceeding 
light has so dazzled weak modern eyesight that 
they have sometimes been called dark, for in 
them 

" L'occhio si smarria 
Come virtii che a troppo si confonda.' " 

To the discerning critic, certainly, the " Para- 
diso " appears, not merely a part of the great 
Epic of the Soul absolutely necessary for the 
comprehension of the other parts, but, consid- 
ered as poetry and nothing else, from its initial 
vision of 

" La gloria di Colui che tutto muove," 

to its final glorification of 

" L'Amor che muove il sole e 1'altre stelle," 
one long outpouring of divinely rapturous song. 

Miss Phillimore's " Dante at Ravenna," the 
third book upon our list, is modestly " offered 
as a humble contribution to the mass of litera- 
ture and research which centres in that great 
name." It is based, in the main, upon Signer 
Ricci's "I/Ultimo Rifugio di Dante Alighieri," 
which has been to some extent supplemented by 
the researches of the writer, made in London 
and Oxford, in Paris and Ravenna. The book 
must be described as a pleasant performance, 
but a discursive and amateurish one, not as 
scrupulous as it should have been in the veri- 
fication of its statements, and fitted rather for 
a popular than for a scholarly audience. The 
most interesting part of the book is the closing 
chapter, which gives the strange history of the 
mortal remains of Dante and of their discovery 
in our own time. The poet himself, his tomb, 
and his beloved Pineta, supply subjects for the 
three illustrations of the volume. 

We owe to the collaboration of Mr. Philip 
H. Wicksteed and Miss C. Mabel Lawrence the 
last work upon our list, which is a translation 
of certain " Essays on Dante," selected from 
the voluminous writings of Karl Witte. It is 
not too much to say, with Mr. Wicksteed, that 
" if the history of the revival of interest in 
Dante which has characterized this century 
should ever be written, Karl Witte will be the 
chief hero of the tale." It is to his efforts, 
more than to those of any other man, that the 
study of the poet was brought out of the morass 
of allegorical interpretation and mystical spec- 
ulation to be set upon the firm path of sound

and sane scholarship. The list of his writings 
upon the subject, in German, Italian, and 
Latin, begins with the classical essay " Ueber 
das Missverstandniss Dantes," published in 
1823, and extends to the close of Witte's long 
and useful life in 1883, when his years num- 
bered those of the century in which he lived. 
The writings include twenty-five separate pub- 
lications, ranging from articles in the " Dante 
Jahrbuch " to the great critical edition of the 
" Gottliche Kombdie," besides the two thick vol- 
umes of " Dan te-Forschungen," from which Mr. 
Wicksteed has selected sixteen of the fifty-two. 
There are some interesting things about Witte's 
life. His father gave him a John Stuart Mill 
education, preparing him to enter the Univer- 
sity of Leipzig at the age of nine and a half, 
and to take the doctor's degree, with a mathe- 
matical thesis, before he was fourteen. And 
as Mill claimed that whatever he had accom- 
plished was the result, not of special abilities, 
but of proper training, so Witte's father 
claimed that his son had no exceptional talents, 
and was so delighted with what his system had 
produced that he published a work in two vol- 
umes upon the development of the boy's intel- 
lect. It is not strange, then, that at eighteen 
Witte found his way to Dante, or that at twenty- 
three, by publishing the essay already mentioned, 
he " entered the lists against existing Dante 
scholars, all and sundry, demonstrated that 
there was not one of them that knew his trade, 
and announced his readiness to teach it to 
them." This essay stands second among the six- 
teen in Mr. Wicksteed's selection, and among 
the most important of the others are " Dante's 
Trilogy," " Dante's Cosmography," " The Eth- 
ical Systems of the Inferno and the Purga- 
torio," "The Topography of Florence about 
the Year 1300," and "Dante and United 
Italy." Most of these chapters are not merely 
monographs of the pedantic German type, but 
rather essays of a highly readable sort, brilliant 
and even eloquent in their manner. In the 
matter of extracts, Mr. Wicksteed has, reluct- 
antly, adopted the plan of translating every- 
thing, Italian, Latin, and French, into English, 
although he admits that " the logic is all the 
other way." We do not think him well-advised 
in so doing ; the translations are not objection- 
able in themselves, but they should have been 
accompanied by the originals, even at the cost 
of adding another fifty pages to the volume. 
In dealing with matters of controversy he has 
shown better judgment, avoiding the " running 
corrective and refuting commentary " which 



disfigure so many scholarly works of this de- 
scription, yet supplying footnotes where abso- 
lutely indispensable, and discussing in an ap- 
pendix the main difficulties involved in Witte's 
positions upon controverted themes. On the 
whole, we are extremely grateful to the trans- 
lators for this book, which provides what is 
certainly the best of Witte's work, and prac- 
tically all of it that students who will not take 
the trouble to learn German have a right to 
expect. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



PRESENT TENDENCIES IN ECONOMIC 
THOUGHT.* 



One of the most successful professors of English 
literature used to advise his students to read only 
the one best novel of any author, and then to read 
a book of the same general sort by some other writer 
of prominence : having read " John Halifax, Gen- 
tleman," for example, as the one work on which its 
author's reputation in the main rests, follow it with 
" Felix Holt "; or, if you have been enjoying Scott's 
" Legend of Montrose," then, and not till then, read 
Stevenson's " Kidnapped." 

This advice to read books in pairs is particularly 
applicable to works relating to economics and to the 
many schemes of political and social reform which are 
so forcibly and so persistently urged upon the public. 
Such an essay in American economic history, for in- 
stance, as that by Professor Hammond on " The Cot- 
ton Industry," in our present category, is a most sav- 
ory dish with which to supplement the dry bones of 
German economic theory in Professor Crook's ex- 
amination of " Wage Theories," especially as the 
one book is excellent of its kind and the other is at 
best only indifferently well done ; while books like 
Mr. Gronlund's " New Economy " and Mrs. Stet- 
son's " Women and Economics " need the wholesome 
antidote of Professor Henderson's systematic trea-

tise on " Social Elements " to help us maintain a 
stable mental equilibrium. 

" The New Economy " is an exceptionally clever 
bit of special pleading ; " Social Elements " is a 
judicial review of the several and often discordant 
phases of our complex social life. The author of 
the one is preaching a doctrine, and he naturally 
writes with all the ardor of a reformer and even of 
an evangelist ; the author of the other is writing a 
text-book, or, rather, he is lecturing to students, 
for his book still retains many of the marks of the 
lecture form. He therefore carefully avoids argu- 
ing the case, but takes you up on the mountain-peak 
of highest scholarship and gives you a comprehen- 
sive view of the whole field of social activities, point- 
ing out the peculiar institutions, with the character- 
istics and significance of each. 

Professor Henderson has also given a distinctly 
literary flavor to his book, not only by crowding his 
pages with the noble thoughts of the poets and prose 
writers of all ages and of every nation, but by having 
a care to his own thought, giving it beauty of form as 
well as strength of substance. This does not mean that 
he has attempted any of that " fine writing " which 
disfigures, but that he has chosen his words and 
phrases with that simplicity which gives elegance to 
his style and pleasure to his readers ; he has not 
forgotten that books are written to be read, and that 
the aim of an author should be to have his thoughts 
easily understood. His work consequently com- 
mends itself to those " whom extended experience 
in the classroom has taught to view with profound- 
est respect the infinite capability of the human mind 
to resist the introduction of knowledge." There is, 
moreover, a skilful arrangement of chapters, by 
which we are led easily up from the simple and the 
familiar things about us to those less known and 
more difficult of comprehension, our interest never 
flagging, until at last we find ourselves wrestling 
with " Some Problems of Social Psychology," in 
Chapter XV. 

Mr. Gronlund's logic is simple in the extreme, 
and his programme of social reform sounds so per- 
fectly feasible and so thoroughly practical that the 
wonder is we do not adopt it at once. Indeed, the 
casual reader, differing though he might with the 
author at nearly every conclusion he reaches, would 
find it difficult to tell why they should have parted 
company, and where or how one can admit the pre- 
mises of Mr. Gronlund (1) that "something must 
be done," and (2) that "industrial democracy is 
inevitable " and still deny the truth of his appar- 
ently logical inference, (3) that " collectivism is the 
climax " and the noble ideal toward which we should 
all strive with every means in our power. Our im- 
mediate aim, he says, should be to give to our work- 
ingmen as much security and independence as pos- 
sible short of the Cooperative Commonwealth, so 
that we may soften, though not solve, the labor 
problem (p. 135). To this end he proposes a party 
programme of eleven measures, six of state (p. 150) 
and five of national activity (p. 227), as follows : 



1. Obligatory Industrial Arbitration. 

2. Effective Labor Organizations. 

3. State Productive Work for Unemployed (Road -mak- 
ing, e. g.) 

4. Municipal Enterprises under State Control water, gas, 
and electric light supply, street-car accommodation, telephone 
service, etc. 

5. State Control of the Liquor Traffic. This "is right, 
mainly because it will abolish the saloon while not depriving 
any one of the indulgence in moderate drinking, which the 
State has no right to do " (p. 209). 

6. State Socialization of Mines. 

7. Nationalization of the Telegraph and Express Business. 

8. Government Banking in its two divisions (a) savings- 
banks, (b) loan-offices, to which 

9. Postal Savings Banks afford a first step. 

10. National Control of all Fares and Freight Rates, as a 
step to the Nationalization of the Railroads. 

11. The Department of Agriculture constituted an effective 
organ for the farmers, "for buying them the machinery, the 
fertilizers, the seeds, the breeding animals which they may 
need, their organ for selling their surplus products for 
them" (p. 291). 

For each of these steps Mr. Gronlund offers careful 
explanation of how it has worked, and ample justi- 
fication of how it would work for the uplift of hu- 
manity and the betterment of the race. He urges, 
moreover, that the peculiar note of collectivism is 
wholly absent from these measures, and that there 
is a good deal more collectivism in any one of our 
trusts than in all of them (p. 296). Singularly 
enough, the means by which Mr. Gronlund expects 
to secure the adoption of this platform with eleven 
planks is popular education in the public school : 
the substitution, that is, of Kindergarten and Man- 
ual Training methods for the present undemocratic 
system of primary and secondary education. In 
addition to this pedagogical campaign to secure 
higher ideals in the next generation, Mr. Gronlund 
proposes civic churches (p. 350) where " well- 
informed, thoughtful men and women will on Sun- 
days listen to lectures by competent, trained teach- 
ers on political, economical, and educational sub- 
jects, and take part in sober discussions thereon 
not with a sort of apology as is done even in so-called 
'People's Churches,' but conscious that they are 
acting in unison with the powers and forces that 
are working out the destiny of humanity." 

"It should not be difficult to make every public- 
spirited citizen see that, if we could gather the squalid 
children teeming in the tenements of our large cities 
into sunny Kindergartens, teach them neatness and gen- 
tleness, open their eyes to beauty, train their hands in 
useful activities aud develop their minds naturally and 
by an orderly method, the gravest dangers to our civili- 
zation would be averted" (p. 313). 

" Manual training will finally solve the problem we 
have set ourselves. It will, in the first place, give the 
pupil power to make the most of himself, to know some- 
thing thoroughly, and this it will accomplish by leading 
the youthful mind to form habits of observation, of self- 
activity, of self-development, and thus to become a self- 
educator. And, in the second place, it will actually 
make of the youth an all-around man and an all-around 
woman, too, for that matter; it is in very truth itself a 
liberal education; manual training, properly understood, 
opens up the whole universe of knowledge and culture " 
(pp. 323-324).

Mr. Gronlund is confident that a fourteen-year-old 
boy, educated as he suggests (and the experiment 
has already been tried, both in Boston and in a 
suburb of Chicago) " will be fully the peer in knowl- 
edge, in mental acumen and moral perceptions, of 
any of our young men of twenty-one who has just 
graduated from Harvard" (p. 325). But it is not 
on this account that he advocates a new education ; 
it is, rather, as his sub-title suggests, as a means to 
the peaceful solution of the social problem. A higher 
body of ideals and a growing consciousness of our 
being social functionaries will alone " relegate pay, 
profits, and property to the secondary position, where 
in fact they belong" (p. 42). He depends upon 
the school to supply the one, and the civic church 
the other. Both are essential, he insists, as the 
only means of preventing that civil war of classes 
for which socialists are preparing us. 

" The plain fact is, that every one of us, industrially 
or socially employed, whether as a banker, a baker, a 
teacher, or a hod-carrier, is doing his work, because so- 
ciety, and only because society, needs his services and 
needs them then and there. A man may choose his 
function in the community, but its duties are not of his 
choosing" (p. 40). 

It is the conscious social recognition of this fact that 
will bring about and will mark the new economy. 
" The Trust is the last evolutionary term of the pres- 
ent social order. Democracy in any real sense is as 
yet but a tendency, though an irresistible tendency " 
(p. 27). This practical programme Mr. Gronlund 
proposes as the best we can hope for in the interim 
which must elapse before mankind is ready for the 
Cooperative Commonwealth. 

Standing near Mr. Gronlund's Civic Church, we 
may confidently look in the next century for Mrs. 
Stetson's " commodious and well-served apartment 
house for professional women with families " 
(p. 242). It will be without kitchens, but there will 
be a kitchen belonging to the house from which 
meals can be served to the families in their rooms 
or in a common dining-room as preferred. It will 
be a home where the cleaning will be done by effi- 
cient workers, not hired separately by the families, 
but engaged by the manager of the establishment ; 
and a roof-garden, day-nursery, and kindergarten, 
under well-trained professional nurses and teachers, 
will insure proper care of the children. . 

" The demand for such provision is increasing daily 
and must soon be met, not by a boarding-house or a 
lodging-house, a hotel, a restaurant, or any makeshift 
patching together of these; but by a permanent pro- 
vision for the needs of women and children, of family 
privacy with collective advantage. This must be offered 
on a business basis to prove a substantial business suc- 
cess; and it will so prove, for it is a growing social need." 

The author's contention is that our homes as at 
present constituted afford none of those things which 
we have been accustomed to associate with them, 
and that the several professions involved in our 
clumsy method of housekeeping should be special- 
ized to make the home of the twentieth century in 



keeping with church and state and industry. She 
wastes no sympathy mourning over the past, but 
urges that the economic dependence and consequent 
social subjection of women has fulfilled its evolu- 
tionary function and is rapidly becoming socially 
destructive, not constructive ; that the insufficient 
and irritating character of our existing form of 
marriage is shown by the fact (p. 300) " that women 
must be forced to it by the need of food and clothes, 
and men by the need of cooks and housekeepers "; 
that the home (p. 313) should no longer be an eco- 
nomic entity, with its cumbrous industrial machinery 
huddled behind it, but that the industries of the 
home life should be managed professionally ; that 
the existing relation of economic dependence does 
not contribute to the development of either of the 
three essential elements of society beautiful 
women, strong men, and intelligent children ; that 
what we need are changes which shall minister to 
the social uplift of the newly specialized American 
wife and mother, and homes which shall give play 
for her increasing specialization. 

"Where the embryonic combination of cook-nurse- 
laundress-chambermaid-housekeeper-waitress-governess 
was content to be " jack of all trades " and mistress of 
none, the woman who is able to be one of these things 
perfectly suffers doubly from not being able to do what 
she wants to do, and from being forced to do what she 
does not want to do. To the delicately differentiated 
modern brain the jar and shock of changing from trade 
to trade a dozen times a day is a distinct injury, a 
waste of nervous force " (p. 155) . 

There is a sense, therefore, in which Mrs. Stet- 
son's attractive volume will serve as a suitable 
counter-irritant both to Professor Henderson's sci- 
entific analysis of the five elementary social institu- 
tions the family, the schoolhouse, industry, the 
church, and the government, and to Mr. Gron- 
lund's advocacy of the Collectivist Republic : both 
books are written from what might be called the 
masculine point of view, if a point could be said to 
have life ; " Women and Economics " shows us the 
woman's side of the case in an entirely new light. 
The author is not arguing a case in court, but stat- 
ing a profound social philosophy ; and she does this 
with enough wit and sarcasm to make the book 
very entertaining reading, and with such a wealth 
of illustration from the study of man's development 
from primitive conditions, and of the sex relations 
of animal life, as to make her theory seem almost 
startling in the vividness of its truth. 

" This change is not a thing to prophesy and plead 
for. It is a change already instituted, and gaining 
ground among us these many years with marvellous 
rapidity " (p. 316). 

" It is worth while for us to consider the case fully 
and fairly; to introduce conditions that will change hu- 
manity from within, making for better motherhood and 
fatherhood, better babyhood and childhood, better food, 
better homes, better society, this is to work for human 
improvement along natural lines. It means enormous 
racial advance, and that with great swiftness; for this 
change does not wait to create new forces, but sets free

those already potentially strong, so that humanity will 
fly up like a released spring. And it is already hap- 
pening. All we need to do is to understand and help " 
(p. 317). 

We are the only animal species in which the female 
depends on the male for food, the only animal spe- 
cies in which the sex-relation is also an economic 
relation. Mrs. Stetson's, book is written to offer a 
simple and natural explanation of this fact, to show 
its present significance, and " to reach in especial 
the thinking women of to-day, and urge upon them 
a new sense, not only of their social responsibility as 
individuals, but of their measureless racial import- 
ance as makers of men." Herein her book em- 
bodies the idea which marks perhaps the most pro- 
nounced tendency of recent thought along economic 
lines, namely, that social progress is more and more 
becoming a conscious process, and that, while it is 
perfectly true that there is a natural and physical 
basis for society and for social institutions, it is 
equally true that in a large measure man is as he 
thinks he is and as he wills he shall be. 

The two books remaining to be noticed in this 
review also illustrate this tendency, though in a less 
degree. They are both of them doctors' theses 
offered at Columbia, and therefore represent uni- 
versity tendencies in part rather than those of the 
thinking world at large. They deal with the history 
of a particular line of industry and the evolution of 
a special phase of German thought ; these are of 
necessity impersonal in character, and do not involve 
controversy and criticism ; they are to be judged 
on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the inves- 
tigation and the attractiveness with which results 
are presented. 

Professor Hammond has made a careful study 
of the cotton culture and trade, and tells us what we 
want to know about it. The effect of the agricul- 
tural economy of the Southern States produced by 
the cultivation of cotton is shown in the introduc- 
tory chapter. In his second chapter the connection 
beween slavery and cotton-growing at the South is 
set forth in a systematic, judicial, and critical man- 
ner ; we are shown the necessary relation of cause 
and effect in social as well as chemical matters. 
" Cotton was not responsible for the origin of slav- 
ery in the South, but to it was wholly due the ex- 
tension of that institution. The movement towards 
emancipation was checked by the discovery that 
cotton could be profitably cultivated throughout the 
whole Southern country" (p. 42). After three 
chapters devoted to the history of Southern agri- 
culture, Book I. closes with two chapters on the 
present condition of the cotton culture and the 
remedy for over-production. This latter, Mr. Ham- 
mond thinks, is only to be found in the establishment 
and extension of a proper system of agricultural 
credit (p. 196). Book II. is a study of the cotton 
trade and the evolution of the cotton market, the 
most noticeable feature of which, since the Civil 
War, has been the growth of the cotton manufacture 
near the seat of the supply of the raw material 



(p. 343). The cotton industry will form the sub- 
ject of another volume. 

All history will have to be rewritten, was the 
reply of one of America's greatest historians, Mot- 
ley, to the question as to what field he would advise 
a young man to cultivate. Each succeeding century 
each generation, almost gains a new outlook 
and higher standards of truth by which to measure 
the thought and life of the past. We study what 
has been and what is, to show us what will be. An 
essay which does not show this contrast, and which 
does not afford better light to our path and lamps 
to our feet, is subject to the criticism that it begins 
nowhere, ends nowhere, and has nothing scientific 
between : it has not even an academic interest. 

This criticism is in part applicable to the attempt 
of Professor Crook to write a history of the de- 
velopment of German Wage Theories. He be- 
gins well, by showing the dependence of German 
economists on Adam Smith and the definite reason 
for this : " The conditions of economic life in the 
two countries were very different. There was want- 
ing on German soil the stimulating influence of 
unsolved practical problems of economics" (p. 8). 
Germany had no factory system during the first half 
of the century ; as late as 1882 " 42 per cent of 
the German textile industry was still conducted in 
the home or domestic workshop" (p. 9). But the 
author's conclusion (p. 113) that, when we have 
made all allowances, the residual theory fails to 
satisfy the mind completely, is not, to say the least, 
eminently satisfying in itself, and there is nothing 
exceptionally scientific between the beginning and 
the end : one is forced to query why such history is 
written. ARTHUR B. WOODFORD. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

An English The D6ed f &n English history of

the want has been but imperfectly supplied by 
Mr. Butler Clarke's manual and by Mr. David

As for Ticknor, while that monumental work is 
not likely to be wholly displaced for a long time, 
it must be admitted that it is very defective in the 
light of later research. The need is now supplied, 
as far as a single volume of moderate dimensions 
can supply it, by the " Spanish Literature " written 
for the series of " Literatures of the World " (Ap- 
pleton) by Mr. James Fitzmaurice Kelly, of all 
living English writers the most competent to pre- 
pare such a book. This accomplished Spanish 
scholar and Cervantist not only knows his subject, 
but he has also the literary faculty required to make 
thoroughly interesting reading of such a manual, in 
which latter respect his volume does not derogate 
from the high standard already set for this series 
by Dr. Garnett and Professor Dowden. He has,

too, opinions of his own, which is rather refreshing 
in view of the colorless and perfunctory character 
usually attaching to condensed surveys of this gen- 
eral description. For example, he remarks of 
Senor Echegaray that, " a delightfully middle-class 
writer, his appreciation by middle-class audiences 
calls for no special comment." This comment will 
cause exquisite pain to the " advanced " critics who 
hail every new experimental literary product as a 
revelation of hitherto unequalled genius. In the 
matter of extracts, the author is rather more liberal 
than his predecessors in the preparation of this 
series, and he is not afraid to use an occasional line 
or two of Spanish. We are minded to suggest one 
bit of criticism that he would probably have used 
had he known of it. Schopenhauer, after reading 
the " Numancia " of Cervantes, made it the subject 
of the following quatrain : 

" Den Selbstmord einer ganzen Stadt 
Cervantes bier geschildert hat ; 
Wenn alles bricht, so bleibt uns nur 
Riickkehr zum Urquell der Natur." 
We mention this because it is the sort of thing that 
Mr. Kelly likes to introduce, and the introduction 
of which makes his volume so more than usually 
readable. We may add, by way of closing, that the 
author's theme is Castilian literature, and has little 
to say of books written in the Asturian, Galician, 
and Catalan dialects, or in that " spoiled child of 
philologers," the Basque tongue. 

The historical T he second volume of the "Histor- 
deveiopment of ical Development of Modern Europe 
Modem Europe. _ 1849-97 " ( Putnam) is equal in 
scholarship and similar in treatment to its prede- 
cessor. The history of Europe is shown as a devel- 
opment ; movements and subjects are dealt with as 
" logical wholes." The separate parts or movements 
considered are such as the Second Empire, European 
diplomacy in the Crimean War, the constitutional 
development of Piedmont and the union of Italy, 
the growth of Prussia and the struggle for German 
hegemony, the establishment of the Austro-Hunga- 
rian Monarchy, the Progress of the Eastern Ques- 
tion. If we were called upon to choose out of these 
splendid chapters, we would say Mr. Andrews is 
particularly happy in treating of Napoleon III. and 
European politics in his time. A single sentence 
summarizes the causes of the rise of this charlatan : 
" Lamartine, the idol of the Parisians ten months 
before, and Cavaignac the dictator of the June days, 
were both defeated by a name and a legend." The 
author shows how the Crimean War indirectly was 
the revenge of Europe for its reactionary policy in 
1848 ; how Louis Napoleon himself, hypocritically 
pretending liberal ideas, profited by the discon- 
tent to acquire glory, calculating that the political 
theories of England would force her to the French 
side. Another chapter in which Mr. Andrews so 
successfully treats European history as a "logical 
whole" is that narrating the unification of Italy. 
The combination of circumstances which led to the 
French intervention in Italy, the arrest of Ital- 



ian unity at the very gates of Rome, the effect of 
'66 and Sedan upon Italian politics, all these 
are skilfully woven into one compact account, mas- 
terful in clearness and in grasp. The book, how- 
ever, has a false end. The year 1878 had been a 
much better terminal point, for since that time new 
policies and purposes have initiated changes the 
wide ends of which no man can guess. What with 
the Dreyfus affair in France, the crisis in Austria- 
Hungary, and the Far Eastern Question, the future 
of Europe is uncertain. The last quarter of the 
nineteenth century to the coming historian will be 
rather the prologue to the twentieth century than 
an epilogue to the nineteenth. 

Historic homes In a tasteful volume of 275 pages, 
in the mountains entitled "Historic Homes of the 
of Virginia. South-West Mountains, Virginia" 

(Lippincott), Mr. Edward C. Mead essays to per- 
petuate the characteristics of the famous old houses 
of this cynosural section of the Old Dominion, and 
gives a brief anecdotal and genealogical account of 
the families whose names are more closely and his- 
torically connected with them. Some of these names 
as Jefferson and Randolph are of national, and 
all of them are of local, historic interest. There are 
twenty-eight papers in all, the list being headed with 
an account of Monticello that political shrine of 
serio-comic memory which is well symbolized in its 
quaintly composite architecture, showing, in front, 
the chaste portico of a Doric temple, through which 
the votary passes on to the domestic and culinary 
arrangements of the interior and the rear. Thither 
the philosophic Jefferson retired, an honored Pali- 
nurus, from the helm of state, to prune his vines 
and plant his cabbages, and, as the event showed, 
to be literally eaten out of house and home by 
intrusive swarms of the " plain people " who came 
ostensibly to pay their respects to, but really to stare 
at, the future Patron Saint of American democracy. 
One scarcely knows whether to be more amused or 
disgusted at the picture of these Vandals lighting 
like locusts on Monticello, " eating up all the pro- 
duce of the estate," and committing a thousand vul- 
gar impertinences under the veil of admiration for 
the persecuted proprietor, upon whom they bestowed 
nothing in return for his enormously abused hospi- 
tality save the crown of martyrdom. Mr. Mead 
writes sympathetically and with an intimate knowl- 
edge of his theme. There are many pleasing half- 
tone plates, and the volume is got up in the sump- 
tuous style of a gift-book. The edition is limited to 
750 copies.

George and Louis Rhead. The decorations remind 
one of Mr. Walter Crane, and are in the main sat-

Raphaelite or neo-mediseval manner, and range in 
quality from good to indifferent though one or 
two examples (as the preposterous plate on page 88) 
must in candor he pronounced positively had. The 
drawings by the brothers Rhead are undeniably 
clever and striking in their way ; hut in too many 
instances they are marred by a certain stiffness, one 
might almost say woodenness, which becomes un- 
pleasantly apparent when one compares them men- 
tally (as is inevitable) with the work of such illus- 
trators as Hunt and Rossetti, or even of Madox 
Brown, with whose manner they have closest affin-

it certainly is a striking one, and should find favor

pilot, Wong Sue ; and anyone who has " done " the 
sights (and smells) of San Francisco's bit of the 
Far East will vouch for the accuracy of the recorded 
impressions of both narrator and artist. Mr. 
Fletcher develops a very happy vein of quiet humor, 
and his knack of neat and graphic description is 
undeniable. The drawings are on thin paper 
mounted on boards, and they are sprightly and 
artistic. The edition is limited to 750 copies. 

It may be suspected that if the amen- 
ities of legal debate were preserved, 
and Marie Corelli allowed to close 
the argument in "The Modern Marriage Market" 
(Lippincott), as she was to open it, its forensics 
would resemble nothing so much as the Kilkenny 
cats of fable. For Miss Corelli falls afoul of the 
" Modern Marriage Market " (whatever that is) ; 
Lady Jeune falls afoul of Miss Corelli, and the 
M. M. M.; Mrs. Flora Annie Steel of L. J., M. C., 
and the M. M. M.; and Susan, Countess of Malmes- 
bury, of all the foregoing, in a manner which has 
the elaborate constructive detail of " The House that 
Jack Built " and the style of the contest between 
the famous cats aforesaid. Only, Miss Corelli not 
being permitted a rejoinder, there is a very small 
tip left of her argument indeed, while the Countess 
of Malmesbury's flourishes like a green bay tree : if 
the tropes are here confused, they are assuredly 
much less so than the topic after it has passed 
through so many distinguished inkstands. For it is 
a hopeless undertaking to save even shreds of " The 
Modern Marriage Market." It is, and it is n't. 
One of the contestants avers one thing, only to be 
supported and contradicted by each of those who 



come after. Miss Corelli speaking, it is to be 
hoped, without her own experience regards it as 
something dreadful, and descants upon it in a way 
which is nothing less than passionate. Lady Jeune 
thinks pretty well of it, and discusses it in relation 
to the colonial empire of Great Britain and other 
closely related matters. Mrs. Steel is not quite sure, 
but believes upon the whole that the Hindoo custom 
of child-marriage is better. And Lady Malmesbury 
thinks all the other things that are left for anybody 
to think of. It can hardly be expected that the 
reader will think at all if he is a man, he will 
not, in self-defence. 

In his chastely elegant little volume 
entitled "Tales of the Enchanted 
Islands of the Atlantic " (Macmillan), 
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson turns to 
graceful account the riches of the hitherto similarly 
unexploited field of legendary lore that the European 
fancy for more than a thousand years wove about 
the mysterious isles, real or fancied, of the Western 
Ocean. Although we cannot quite admit the accu- 
racy of Colonel Higginson's sweeping claim that 
these legends are " a part of the mythical period of 
American history," we have nothing but approval 
for the way in which he has treated them. The vol- 
ume is conceived in the spirit and written in the 
style of Hawthorne's " Wonder Book," of which it 
forms a worthy and desirable counterpart. There 
are twenty tales in all, under such alluring titles as 
" The Story of Atlantis," " Taliessin of the Radiant 
Brow," " Merlin the Enchanter," " Sir Lancelot of 
the Lake," " Maelduin's Voyage," " The Island of 
Satan's Hand," " Harald the Viking," Bimini and 
the Fountain of Youth." Mr. Albert Herter has 
supplied a half-dozen full-page illustrations, which 
are both charmingly fancied and artistically done, 
and add decidedly to the attractiveness of the pret- 
tily bound, well-printed volume. It is an especially 
acceptable and stimulating book for young readers, 
whose imaginations are certainly in little danger of 
over-feeding in these practical times. 

The city of Penn and Franklin has 
$&* found a graceful and sympathetic 

popular historian in Miss Agnes 
Repplier, whose " Philadelphia, the Place and the 
People " (Macmillan) forms a suitably sober pendant 
to Miss King's romantic and stirring story of New 
Orleans, its companion volume. Miss Repplier's 
always rather prim style, with its old-time graces 
and mannerisms and verbal tags out of Pepys and 
the " Spectator," accords well with her present 
theme. Beginning with a kindly sketch of its ex- 
cellent though maligned founder, she sketches with a 
light and fluent touch the generally serene though 
not untroubled history of the Quaker City down to 
present times. The treatment is popular, and from 
a literary point of view especially the book calls for 
cordial approval. There are many illustrations, 
comprising a charming portrait of Penn who

must, it would seem, have been extremely unlike 
the unctuous philosopher-farmer of West's pictorial 
idyl, "The Treaty at Shackamaxon." We have 
nothing but praise for these two delightful compan- 
ion studies in civic history, and we hope to see other 
volumes added to the series. 



41 Sartor 
Resartus " 
illustrated. 



At first thought, " Sartor Resartus " 
would seem to be one of the last 
books to tempt the hand of an illus- 
trator. But even the Bible is " pictured " and " dec- 
orated " nowadays, and it was probably inevitable 
that the illustrators would sooner or later get around 
to Carlyle. We can therefore only be grateful that 
the task has been elected by such a capable artist 
as Mr. Edmund J. Sullivan, whose seventy-five pen- 
and-ink drawings for " Sartor Resartus " are em- 
bodied in a handsome new edition of that work just 
issued in this country by the Maemillan Co. Mr. 
Sullivan has not attempted to depict the complete 
scenes and episodes of the book, but has confined 
himself, in the main, to portraits of the principal 
characters and to pictures of an allegorical or dec- 
orative nature. With few exceptions, the drawings 
show considerable originality and strength, and en- 
title the artist to a place in the front rank of pen-and- 
ink draughtsmen of the day. We fancy the true 
Carlylean will prefer his " Sartor " unillust rated, 
but in any case he cannot fail to be interested in 
Mr. Sullivan's clever drawings. 

if ore of the Two more volumes have appeared of 

biographical the biographical edition of Thack- 
Thackeray. eray > 8 workg (Harper). The eighth 

contains "The Newcomes," and extends to more 
than eight hundred pages, besides the usual forty of 
introduction. Mrs. Ritchie's selection of material 
for her part of the book consists of reminiscences 
and letters of Thackeray's schoolboyhood, and notes 
on his continental wanderings during the years 
1853-55, when the novel was written. It came, as 
will be noticed, between his two visits to America, 
and filled in the period fairly well, when we con- 
sider that it took nearly half a million words to tell 
the story. The ninth volume gives us the <l Christ- 
mas Books," with all their wealth of caricature 
illustration. The introduction to this volume is the 
longest yet written, extending to sixty pages, and 
made proportionally interesting by its account of 
the relations between Thackeray and FitzGerald. 
Headers will remember the quoted reply of the 
novelist when asked, late in life, whom of his friends 
he loved best. " Old Fitz and Brookfield." The 
story is here corroborated by Mrs. Ritchie. She 
says : " I have been wondering whereabouts in my 
father's life the FitzGerald chapter should come in. 
It lasted from 1829 to 1863, sometimes carried on 
with words and signs, sometimes in silence, but it 
did not ever break off, though at times it passed 
through the phases to which all that is alive must be 
subject : it is only the dead friendships which do 
not vary any more." After the novelist's death, 



FitzGerald put together a book of Thackeray's let- 
ters to him, including many drawings, and it is this 
unique volume that has supplied most of the mate- 
rial for the present chapter. It contains nothing 
more touching than some verses written by Fitz- 
Gerald in the early years of the friendship. Here 
is one of the stanzas : 

" If I get to be fifty, may Willy get too. 
And we '11 laugh, Will, at all that grim sixties can do. 
Old age ! Let him do of what poets complain, 
We '11 thank him for making us children again ; 
Let him make us grey, gouty, blind, toothless, or silly, 
Still old Ned shall be Ned, and old Willy be Willy." 

Mrs. Ritchie adds : " All through our own childish 
days the dear and impressionable friend, so gener- 
ous and helpful in time of trouble, used to appear 
and disappear, just as a benevolent supernatural 
being might be expected to do, whose laws were 
somewhat different from ours, and for whom com- 
monplace and dull routine hardly existed." 

Mr. John A. Gade has compiled from 
original and orther sources a reada- 
ble little work on " Book Plates, Old 
and New " (Mansfield). Within small compass and 
in an interesting manner, he has told the story of 
the ex-libris from its small mediaeval beginnings 
to its acceptance as a latter-day fad. He is accurate 
and sufficiently scholarly within the narrow limits he 
sets himself. It is not quite true to say that Lord 
de Tabley is better known to-day as John Leicester 
Warren, though to a collector of book-plates his 
works in verse would hardly commend themselves 
as contributing to a fame won as a connoisseur when 
book-plate collectors were comparatively few. The 
volume is suitably illustrated, and its price will 

make it useful. 

The story of Lord Nelson's life being 
what it is, and his private affairs 
being readily dissociable from his 
career as the greatest of all sea-fighters, there seems 
to be room for an account which shall include his 
three greatest campaigns and nothing more. Such 
a book appears in " The Great Campaigns of Nel- 
son" (imported by Charles Scribner's Sons), pre- 
pared by Mr. Wm. O'Connor Morris from papers 
originally contributed to the " Fall Mall Magazine." 
Maps have been added, and the lucid chapters may 
be said to serve as a compendious hand-book for 
Captain Mahan's great work. Necessarily, some of 
the fascinating tales of Nelson's early courage are 
omitted, but the gain in succinctness is great, and 
the book seems destined to serve a useful end. For 
our own part, however, we prefer Southey. 

Mr. H. T. Newcomb's little volume 
Railway Economics " (Railway 
World Publishing Co.) may be read 
with profit by all who are interested in the trans- 
portation problem, and especially by those who are 
in the habit of regarding the railways as all-powerful 
and grasping monopolies engaged in plundering the 
public. Mr. Newcomb shows that railway rates are

subject to definite laws, which are largely beyond 
the control of railway managers ; and that while 
competition among the railways themselves cannot 
be relied upon to regulate rates, or for any other 
useful purpose, there is a competition among pro- 
ducers which keeps freight rates down to the lowest 
possible point. A study of the undesirable and 
wasteful features of the other kind of competition 
leads to the conclusion that the Interstate Com- 
merce Act should be so amended as to legalize 
pooling. 

Mr. William D. Guthrie's " Lectures 
on the Fourteenth Article of Amend- 
ment to the Constitution of the 
United States," delivered last spring before the 
Dwight Alumni Association in New York, have 
been published in book form by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. The lectures deal first with the his- 
tory of the amendment and the principles of inter- 
pretation, and then with the meaning of such phrases 
as " due process of law " and " the equal protection 
of the laws " as expounded in decisions of the Su- 
preme Court. A multitude of cases are cited, in 
some of which Mr. Guthrie himself took part as 
counsel, urging a broad interpretation of the amend- 
ment which " has done more than any other cause to 
protect our civil rights from invasion, to strengthen 
the bonds of the Union, to make us truly a nation, 
and to assure the perpetuity of our institutions." 
At the end of the book the Constitution is conven- 
iently annotated with references to cases in which 
it has been construed. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The Bodleian manuscript of Omar Khayyam, discov- 
ered in 1856 by Professor Cowell, and transcribed by 
him, is the oldest codex of the poet as yet known, and 
dates from the year 1460. It has, furthermore, the 
special interest of being the manuscript upon which 
FitzGerald based his immortal poem. A photographic 
reproduction of this manuscript, with a transcript into 
modern Persian characters, a prose translation into En- 
glish, a learned commentary, and a great variety of 
bibliographical and miscellaneous annotation, are all 
provided by Mr. Edward Heron- Allen in "The Rubaiyat 
of Omar Khayyam," a sumptuous volume published in 
this country (in its second edition) by Messrs. L. C. 
Page & Co. It is a book that no Omarian can possibly 
spare from his collection. 

" The New Gulliver," by Mr. Wendell Phillips Gar- 
rison, is in form a very tastefully printed little book 
, issued from the Marion Press of Jamaica, New York. 
In content, it is the story of the strange experience of 
Mr. Theophilus Brocklebank, who rediscovered the coun- 
try of the Houyhnhnms, left unvisited by any Yahoo 
from the time of its original explorer. In purpose, it 
is a mild satire upon the relativity of human knowledge 
and the futility of theological speculation, although this 
purpose is left rather vaguely defined, with the inten- 
tion, we suspect, of mystifying the reader rather than 
qf contributing to his real enlightenment. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



The next publication of the " Brothers of the Book " 
will consist of a reprint of Robert Louis Stevenson's 
essay on " The Morality of the Profession of Letters," 
taken from the " Fortnightly Review " for April, 1881. 

" Bush-Fruits," by Mr. Fred W. Card, is " a horti- 
cultural monograph of raspberries, blackberries, dew- 
berries, currants, gooseberries, and other shrub -like 
fruits," just published by the Macmillan Co. 

" The Boy Who Drew Cats " is a Japanese fable told; 
in English by Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, and printed on 
crepe paper with colored illustrations as an issue of the 
" Japanese Fairy Tale Series " published in Tokyo by 
Mr. T. Hasegawa. It is a charming little book as to both 
text and illustration. 

One of the daintiest little books of the season, a book 
that brings joy to the eye and the heart alike, is a se- 
lection of Elizabethan lyrics made by Mr. FitzRoy 
Carrington, illustrated with portraits of famous Eliza- 
bethans, printed with sixteenth century spelling and 
typography, and entitled " The Queen's Garland." Mr. 
R. H. Russell is the publisher. 

One of the most interesting of recent announcements 
comes in prompt fulfilment of our wish, expressed in 
writing of the Tolstoy anniversary, that we might soon, 
have a uniform English edition of the books of the great 
Russian. Such an edition, in twenty volumes, is now 
under way, to be edited by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole,, 
and published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

It is announced that the competitive examinations for 
the fellowships of the American School of Classical 
Studies at Athens will be held this year on March 16,, 
17, and 18. Candidates are to enter their names on or 
before February 1 with Professor B. I. Wheeler (Ith- 
aca, N. Y.), Chairman of Fellowship Committee, from 
whom all information as to place, subjects, etc., may be 
obtained. These fellowships yield $600 each. The 
Hoppin Fellowship, open to women only, yields $1000. 

Lewis Henry Boutell, of Evanston, Illinois, who died 
on the sixteenth of January at the age of seventy-two, 
was a soldier and lawyer of much distinction. His death 
deprives THE DIAL of a valued contributor, and histor- 
ical scholarship of a zealous student whose published 
work, although inconsiderable in quantity, exhibited 
qualities of a high order. His most important publica- 
tion was a " Life of Roger Sherman," which appeared 
about two years ago. This biography was undertaken 
at the request of Senator Hoar, who had himself made 
preparations to write it, and who transferred the task, 
together with the materials collected, to the competent 
hands of Mr. Boutell. 

In the death of William K. Sullivan, on the seventeenth 
of January, Chicago lost one of the best-known and most 
highly-esteemed of its public men. THE DIAL records 
his death for two reasons : As a member of the Chicago 
Board of Education, and for a term of years its Presi- 
dent, he always stood for the highest standards and the 
most enlightened ideals of public education. As a pro- 
fessional newspaper worker for the greater part of hi* 
active life, first with Mr. Dana on the New York " Sun," 
then with Mr. Horace White on the Chicago " Tribune," 
and eventually as editor of the Chicago " Evening Jour- 
nal," his influence was always on the side of those tra- 
ditions of dignity and seriousness that are now fast 
disappearing from journalism. Born in 1843, in. Water- 
ford, Ireland, he came to this country in time to serve 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



as a volunteer in the closing period of the Civil War. 
He was also a member of the Illinois Legislature, and 
a President of the Chicago Press Club. In 1890 he 
went to Bermuda as United States consul, remaining a 
year in that position. Personally, he was endeared to 
all who knew him by his sincerity, his generosity, and 
the fine courtesy of his manner. There was nothing 
superficial about these qualities; they were rooted in 
the depths of his nature. 

After experimenting for some months with an Amer- 
ican issue of " Literature " which was merely the English 
edition imported in sheets and supplied with new covers 
and a belated date, the publishers, Messrs. Harper & 
Brothers, have at last come to a conclusion which was 
inevitable from the start, and have begun the issue of 
what is in the genuine sense an American edition of this 
periodical. That is, the English matter is used only in 
part, and is supplemented by at least an equal amount 
of new matter prepared in this country. Some of the 
reviews are signed, and others are not. The total matter 
included is less than we have had heretofore (especially 
in the readable department of "notes "), but it is all 
chosen with reference to the interests of American 
readers, and consequently far more likely to attract 
subscribers. January 10 is the date with which this 
" new series " begins.

THE VICTORIAN ERA SERIES 

The series is designed to form a record of the great movements and developments of the 
age, in politics, economics, religion, industry, literature, science, and art, and of the life-work 
of its typical and influential men. 

Under the general editorship of Mr. J. Holland Kose, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, 
Cambridge, England, the individual volumes will be contributed by leading specialists in the 
various branches of knowledge which fall to be treated in the series. 

The volumes will be handsomely bound in cloth, with good paper and large type, suitable 
for the library. Price, $1.25 per volume. 

NOW READY 

THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY 

By J. HOLLAND ROSE, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge (editor of the series). 

An interesting historical account of British Radicalism of the first half of the century fills a large part of the 
volume. . . . On the whole, we are able to praise the volume as a moderate and impartial view of the demo- 
cratization of the Constitution Athenceum. 

In dealing with his subject Mr. Rose displays considerable independence of thought, joined to accuracy of 
detail and clearness of exposition. His style, too, is vigorous; and on the whole he has made a good start for 
what promises to be a useful and instructive series Glasgow Herald. 

If the remaining volumes of the " Victorian Era Series " are written in as able, temperate, and judicious a 
spirit as the first, " The Rise of Democracy," by J. H. Rose, M.A., we anticipate for it a great and deserved 
success. Manchester Guardian. 

For all who wish to get an unbiased view of the Radical movement in England during the present century 
its benefits, its faults, and its limitations this little book can be unhesitatingly recommended Aberdeen Journal. 

THE ANGLICAN REVIVAL pi| .*?.! .'.'- 

By J. H. OVERTON, D.D., Kector of Epworth and Canon of Lincoln. 

We can highly recommend this able history of Canon Overton's, and we hope it may clear the minds of 
many as to the history of " The Anglican Revival." It is by no means a party or an extreme statement of facts, 
but rather a judicial record of the religious events that have moulded " The Anglican Revival " in the Church of 
England during the reign of Queen Victoria. Church Review. 

Dr. Overton's contribution to this series of handy books is a volume that is well worth reading by men and 
women who care to know just where the Established Church is now, and what are its tendencies. Norwich 
Mercury. 

The author . . . writes without bias and with the true spirit of the historian only anxious to secure his 
facts and to "nothing extenuate nor aught set down in malice." Weekly Echo. 

Of the movement itself, and its main actors, Canon Overton gives an excellent account. He has the literature 
of the subject at his fingers' ends, and the story could not be better told. Sheffield Telegraph. 

JOHN BRIGHT t 

By C. A. VINCE, M.A., late Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. 

We have every reason to regard this as the sanest, most impartial, and intelligent life of John Bright that 
has been given to the public. Birmingham Gazette. 

Mr. Vince has had the good sense to allow John Bright, as far as possible, to speak for himself, and he has 
shown great discrimination in the selection of pithy typical passages from memorable speeches at critical junctures 
in the Queen's reign. Speaker. 

An excellent little life of Bright, with a chapter on Bright's oratory which is admirable and most remarkable. 
It constitutes a brief but careful examination of the characteristics which made Bright the first orator of our 
time, and appears to us the best examination of the peculiarities of modern English oratory extant. Athenceum. 

This little book seems to us, in its way, a remarkable success. It is a model of what such a sketch should be 
sober, well-written, with the matter well-ordered, and throughout a tone of judicial care not unmixed with 
enthusiasm. A cademy. 

Mr. Vince's biography of Bright is a model of its kind. It gives us an admirable picture of the man whom 
Lord Salisbury rightly characterized as the greatest master of English oratory that recent generations have seen.

ing and superior to the superficial tales of the ordi-

" As a book to read it will be found exceptionally

HISTORY OF MODERN EUROPE 

By FERDINAND SCHWILL, Ph.D., Instructor in History in the University of Chicago. Crown 8vo, 450 pages, $1.50 net. 
The book is intended to fill the needs of High School and College classes, and to serve as a manual for the general student. Indeed the 
reading public at large will find it specially attractive as well as instructive. Used in sequence to " Europe in the Middle Age," or the smaller 
book, " A Short History of Mediaeval Europe," the " History of Modern Europe " completes a course in General European History in harmony 
with the best and most widely recognized principles of historical study. 

SOCIAL ELEMENTS 

Character Institutions Progress. 

By CHARLES RICHMOND HENDERSON, D.D., President of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, and Pro- 
fessor of Sociology in the University of Chicago. Crown 8vo, $1.50 net. 

Much of the current interest in Sociology rests upon a basis of sentiment rather than fact. In no small degree this condition has plainly 
been due to the lack of a popular treatise stating comprehensively the data involved and issues in debate. Dr. Henderson has provided the 
much-needed systematic outline for investigation and discussion. He treats of the social conditions and problems as they exist in the repre- 
sentative centres of the United States, the most profitable methods of sociological study, and the means at hand with which to improve the 
general situation. 

The Press, Philadelphia: "The work is virile, interesting, and instructive. It deals broadly with all questions embraced under the 
general term of Sociology."

RICHARD G. BOONB, President Michigan State Normal School, Ypsilanli, Michigan : "I know Mr. Gordy and I know he could not write 
an inferior work. I have seen his work in Summer Schools. He has the right conception of what history is, and he knows how to make it 
attractive to the young while still maintaining the dignity of its subject matter. Mr. Gordy's book is admirably executed and one which is 
destined, if I am not mistaken, to fill a large place in common school instruction. It takes hold upon human life and the great questions of 
State and public development which constitute the essential matter of history."

ROUSSEAU, 
AND EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE.

$1.00 net. 

The author shows in his preface that Rousseau's educational system 
forms an integral part of a complete theory of human life. Since 
Rousseau stands in history for the principle of subjectivism, Dr. 
Davidson begins by making clear the current ideas and aspirations 
which gave form and direction to the philosopher's thought ; then, 
having carefully analyzed his character, he proceeds to show how his 
philosophy affected his educational teachings and the far-reaching 
effect these have had upon later pedagogics.

" Aside from the practical importance of the work and permanent 
influence of Horace Mann, his uncommon moral and mental traits, 
the pathetic incidents of his private life, and the dramatic events of 
his public career, leading up to the tragic catastrophe at Antioch 
College, are fascinating in the extreme. Professor Hinsdale has suc-

very readable form, all the essentials of the life and main work of the

CONCERNING DEGREES. 

The measure providing for a regulation of 
academic degrees in the State of Illinois, pre- 
pared by President Henry Wade Rogers of 
Evanston, and recently introduced into the 
Legislature through his initiative, marks the 
first serious attempt to do away with what has 
long been a great evil and a scandal to the good 
name of the State. For several years past, 
Chicago has harbored certain institutions, ex- 
isting chiefly on paper, incorporated under the 
lax educational statutes of the commonwealth, 
and engaged in the nefarious business of fur- 
nishing academic or professional degrees to all 
applicants offering the stipulated consideration 
in cold cash. These rascally traffickers in titles 
to distinction have published their alluring 
offers far and wide, and have found gullible 
victims in considerable numbers, mostly in 
other States and other lands. A number of 
Englishmen, for example, have become bache- 
lors or doctors of these bogus institutions, and 
the swindle has attracted enough attention to 
be made a subject of inquiry in the English 
Parliament. It is certainly time that the abuse 
should be ended, and the measure to which we 
have referred is designed to accomplish that 
desirable purpose. 

In general terms, it is proposed that the 
granting of degrees in Illinois be restricted to 
institutions of approved educational standing, 
and to this end a State Commission is to be 
established, with power to pass upon the claims 
and pretensions of institutions that wish to 
bestow degrees upon their students. So far, 
the proposed measure corresponds to the sort of 
regulation that already obtains in other States, 
and that has been enforced with such conspic- 
uous success in the State of New York. Fur- 
ther, it is proposed that, in the case of colleges 
to be incorporated in the future, a minimum 
endowment of one hundred thousand dollars 
shall be an imperative condition of the degree- 
conferring power. There is also the wise pro- 
viso that degrees may not be granted by any 
institutions carried on for private gain. It is 
extremely desirable that the measure which 
embodies these salutary provisions should be 
given statutory force by the present Legisla- 
ture ; and we urge upon everyone interested 



106 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



in the cause of serious education, as distin- 
guished from sham education, to lend his influ- 
ence to the enactment of the proposed law. A 
great many narrow and selfish interests to 
say nothing of dishonest interests will be 
arrayed against it, and the work of distortion 
and misrepresentation, which began as soon as 
the measure was made public, will create an 
opposition not easily to be overcome. Yet the 
good name and the dignity of the State demand 
that the title-factories should be suppressed, 
demand that every degree henceforth granted 
under the authority of Illinois should stand 
for good work done, or, in the case of the 
honorary degree, for an achievement judged 
to be worthy by some reputable institution of 
learning. 

For the weak-minded persons who are willing 
to purchase the fraudulent degrees so obligingly 
offered we must confess that we have little 
sympathy. It is a pitiful form of vanity to 
which the allurements of the diploma-shops 
appeal, and we are not particularly concerned 
to protect that sort of ambition from the conse- 
quences of its own foolishness. But the public 
has a right to be protected from charlatans of 
all descriptions, and the granting of a degree 
is an act that touches public interests so nearly 
that the process should be hedged about with 
all reasonable restrictions. Indeed, the pro- 
visions of the proposed legislation seem to us 
to err, if anything, upon the side of leniency, 
and we view with no little suspicion the stipu- 
lation of one hundred thousand dollars as the 
minimum endowment of degree -conferring 
institutions hereafter to be incorporated. The 
New York requirement of five times this en- 
dowment seems to be the wiser provision of 
the two, for surely the latter sum is none too 
large for the needs of any new college that 
would be a desirable addition to those we 
already have in this State. It is to be noted 
that the bill is not made retroactive in this 
matter of endowment, so that no injustice to 
existing institutions would result from its en- 
actment. 

The desire to parade a degree of some kind 
is, no doubt, one more illustration of the instinct 
that has created orders of nobility in the older 
civilizations, that has given Frenchmen the 
mania for decorations, and made Germans 
such sticklers for the use of whatever official 
titles they may bear. The American character 
is popularly supposed to have risen above these 
vanities, but this is only a superstition. The 
desire of the individual to be in some way dis- 



tinguished from his fellows is so inherent in 
the human nature which all peoples have in 
common, that, if denied vent in one direction, 
it will find it in another that, if not allowed 
the gewgaws of knighthood and rank, it will 
find a substitute in the mock distinctions that 
come from membership in societies which shall 
here be nameless, but of which no reader will 
have to look far for as many examples as he 
needs. Of course, the ambition to possess an 
academic degree is a shade worthier than the 
ambition to be a Grand Commander of some- 
thing or other, or to sport the proud badge of 
the Scions of Colonial Tax-Gatherers. The 
former ambition betrays, at least, some trace of 
the feeling that intellectual distinctions have 
more intrinsic worth than any others ; yet even 
in this case how often is it true that the exter- 
nal mark of the distinction is the thing sought 
after, rather than the powers for which it 
should rightfully stand. 

The full force of this observation requires 
for its realization that we take into account not 
only the poor souls who stand ready to pur- 
chase degrees outright at the current market 
rates, but also those who bid for them indi- 
rectly, who make gifts to colleges, for example, 
anticipating in return the honorary doctorate. 
We look with righteous scorn upon the English 
ministry that is willing to traffic in titles of 
nobility making peers out of brewers and 
stockbrokers whose political contributions have 
been sufficiently liberal and how much more 
contemptible is the action of the American col- 
lege that is willing to degrade in similar fashion 
the titles of intellectual aristocracy which it 
ought to guard as a sacred trust. There is a 
good deal that might be said also about the 
motives of those who earn their degrees in legit- 
imate ways. Many students seem to think that 
getting a degree is the be-all and the end-all of 
college life. " Will it count for a degree ? " is 
the question they ask when some new kind of 
work is recommended to them. Every teacher 
knows this spirit, and knows how deadly an 
enemy it is of all culture for the sake of cul- 
ture. If the spectacle of young men and young 
women actuated mainly by this motive is a dis- 
heartening one, a spectacle even more disheart- 
ening is offered by those students of advanced 
age who so often are found in the classes of 
our larger universities, and who are so obviously 
out of place there. We make no reference to 
men and women seeking to round out, in later 
life, the defective education of their youth. 
Their pathetic case calls for nothing but sym- 



1899.] 



107 



pathy and respect. We do, however, refer to 
those who, having got far beyond the period of 
their lives when training of the university type 
was what they most needed, submit themselves 
to that training for the sake of its prizes. It 
is not the best sort of discipline for them ; it is 
intellectually wasteful rather than economical ; 
nothing but the incentive of the doctorate im- 
pels them to undergo it ; the act is, in short, 
an unworthy concession to an artificial standard 
of culture. 

It is this tendency to make a fetich of the de- 
gree as if there were no other possible criterion 
of a man's attainments that is responsible, 
on the one hand, for the disreputable business 
of diploma-selling, and, on the other, for the 
spectacle of gray beards engaged in the perform- 
ance of tasks fitted only for youth. If a ficti- 
tious value were not attached to degrees in the 
pedagogical estimation, we should have neither 
the one nor the other of these evils to deplore. 
The common university attitude toward degrees 
is not unsuggestive of the attitude of the 
church toward the consecration of priests : it is 
tacitly assumed that the scholarship has no 
validity which is not thus certified at the hands 
of men who have themselves gone through the 
academic routine and received the consecrating 
cowl. Yet the cowl no more makes the scholar 
than it does the monk. Again, those who are 
banded together by the common possession of 
degrees, especially if they are engaged in the 
professional work of education, are too apt to 
assume an attitude similar to that assumed by 
trade unions toward the outsider. They seem 
to say that, whatever distinction a man may 
have achieved in irregular and unorthodox ways, 
he cannot really be a superior person, because 
he has dared to court fame while forsaking 
the beaten path. The tendencies which we 
have thus noted do not often go to the extremes 
of arrogance or fatuousness, but they go farther 
than they should be allowed to, and they some- 
times work grave injustice. The president of 
one of our leading universities spoke, a few 
years ago, of the Roman emperor who wished 
that all his enemies had a single neck that 
he might cut it off at one stroke, and then 
said that, for his part, he wished that all de- 
grees had a single neck that a single blow 
might put an end to them. While we should 
hardly express our own opinion in so hot a 
fashion as this, we can neither help feeling a 
certain sympathy with the utterance, nor help 
sharing in the indignation by which it was 
inspired. 



RECENT SCHOOL LEGISLATION 
FOR CITIES. 

When the article entitled " City School Systems " 
appeared in THE DIAL (Oct. 16, 1898), I hoped 
at no distant day to return to the subject, going 
more into detail, but dealing with it in a less critical 
and in a more constructive way. Such an article I 
thought might, at the present stage of discussion, 
prove helpful to some readers ; but now that the 
time to carry out this plan has come, I am per- 
suaded that a still better one will be to review, in 
a general way, some recent school legislation that 
illustrates the later movements of public thought. 

The first act of legislation to be noticed related 
to the city of Cincinnati, where, as was widely be- 
lieved at the time, the evils of the old system had 
become intolerable and the need of reform very 
urgent. In 1887 the General Assembly of Ohio 
enacted that henceforth the superintendent of the 
public schools of Cincinnati should appoint all the 
teachers of said schools, by and with the advice 
and consent of the board of education, and that the 
board or superintendent might remove teachers for 
cause. It will be seen that this is putting the super- 
intendent and the board in the same relation to 
appointments that the President and Senate of the 
United States occupy, as prescribed by the Consti- 
tution, in relation to appointments in tbe National 
service. The superintendent nominates teachers to 
the board, which confirms or rejects the person or per- 
sons nominated ; but if the board rejects one of the 
superintendent's nominees, it can do nothing toward 
filling the place until the superintendent sends in a 
second nomination. As we shall see, this method 
of appointing teachers has since been adopted in 
other cities. This law made no other change in the 
administration of tbe Cincinnati schools. 

The Reorganization Act for the Board of Edu- 
cation of Cleveland, passed in 1892, was a far more 
radical piece of legislation than the one just con- 
sidered. It is, indeed, the most radical act of the 
kind that has been passed for any city up to date, and 
deserves the careful study of all men who are inter- 
ested in the reform of city school administration. 
As amended, this act offers to our consideration the 
following principal features : 

1. The board of education consists of a school 
council and a school director. 

2. The legislative power and authority of the 
city school district is vested in a school council of 
seven members, elected biennially for the city at 
large in two groups consisting of three and four mem- 
bers each, who receive each a compensation of $240 
annually. They are chosen by the legally qualified 
electors for school purposes. All legislation enacted 
by this council is by resolution ; and every resolu- 
tion involving expenditure of money or the approval 
of a contract for the payment of money, or for the 
purchase, sale, lease, or transfer of property or levy- 
ing any tax, or for the change or adoption of any 



108 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



text-book, must, before it takes effect, be presented 
certified to the school director for his approval. If 
the director approves of the resolution, he shall sign 
it, and it becomes law ; but if he does not approve 
it, and refuses to sign it, he shall return it with his 
objections to the council, and it can then become 
law only when it receives the votes of two-thirds of 
all the members. The council has power to provide 
for the appointment of all necessary teachers and 
employees, and prescribes their duties and fixes 
their compensation. 

3. The executive power is vested in a school 
director, who, like the members of the council, is 
elected on a city ticket by the qualified voters of 
the city, and, like them, holds his office for the term 
of two years. He is required to devote his entire 
time to the duties of his office, and he receives a 
salary, fixed by law, of $5000 a year. The duties 
of the director in regard to purchasing property, 
entering into contracts, building buildings, making 
repairs, providing supplies, etc., are important, but 
do not come within the range of this article. It 
will be seen that the director is wholly independent 
of the council, standing to the people of the city in 
precisely the same relation as the members of the 
council themselves. 

4. The provisions of the law relative to the ap- 
pointment and duties of the superintendent of 
instruction are so important that I shall quote the 
entire section that contains them. 

"Sec. 10. The school director shall, subject to the approval 
of and confirmation by the council, appoint a superintendent 
of instruction, who shall remain in office during good behavior, 
and the school director may at any time, for sufficient cause, 
remove him ; but the order for such removal shall be in writing, 
specifying the cause therefor, and shall be entered upon the rec- 
ords of his office ; and he shall forthwith report the same to the 
council, together with the reasons therefore. The superintend- 
dent of instruction shall have the sole power to appoint and dis- 
charge all assistants and teachers authorized by the council to 
be employed, and shall report to the school director in writing 
annually, and oftener if required, as to all matters under his 
supervision, and may be required by the council to attend any 
or all of its meetings, and, except as otherwise provided in 
this act, all employees of the board of education shall be ap- 
pointed or employed by the school director. He shall report 
to the council annually, or oftener if required, as to all mat- 
ters under his supervision. He shall attend all meetings of 
the council and may take part in its deliberations, subject to 
its rules, but shall not have the right to vote." 

5. The auditor of the city is the auditor of the 
board of education. 

This important enactment has exerted a consider- 
able influence upon subsequent legislation, although 
it has not been copied in its most radical features. 

A law to reorganize the school system of the city 
of St. Louis passed the State legislature in 1897. 
According to this law the superintendent of instruc- 
tion is appointed by the board of education, which 
consists of twelve members, for a term of four years, 
during which term his compensation cannot be re- 
duced. On his nomination, the board appoints as 
many assistant superintendents as it deems neces- 
sary, and they may be removed by him with the 
board's approval. The superintendent has general 



supervision, subject to the control of the board, of 
the course of instruction, discipline, and conduct of 
the schools, of text-books and studies ; and all ap- 
pointments, promotions, and transfers of teachers, 
and introduction and changes of text-books and 
apparatus, are made only upon his recommendation. 

One more act may be mentioned, that for Toledo, 
passed in 1898. The city board of education con- 
sists of five members, elected for the city at large 
by the electors who are qualified to vote at school 
elections, to serve for the term of five years. Only 
such persons can have their names put on the offi- 
cial ballot, and receive votes, as are endorsed in 
writing for members of the board to the city hoard 
of elections by two hundred of the legal voters of 
the city (as above), of either sex, not less than ten 
days previous to the election. The names of all 
persons who are thus certified, the board of elec- 
tions must publish in the daily papers, and prepare 
ballots containing them, which ballots must be voted 
at the annual municipal election and be deposited 
in a separate ballot-box provided for this purpose. 
Every elector may vote for as many of the candi- 
dates on the ballot as there are members to be 
elected. This provision in regard to making up the 
official ballot is believed to be a novel feature. The 
superintendent of instruction has the power to ap- 
point, subject to the approval and confirmation of 
the board, all teachers authorized to be employed. 

The tendencies of recent school legislation makes 
some things very clear, the more important of which 
may well be set down in numbered order. 

1. There is a strong and a growing conviction 
in the minds of the people most interested, that the 
old-fashioned system of school provision, mainten- 

ance, and administration is not now adapted to ex- 
isting conditions, and must be thrown aside as 
obsolete. At least, it is very clear that such is the 
case in the cities that have been passed in review, 
for the thing has already been done. 

2. While the new laws show considerable differ- 
ences in details, there is nevertheless a substantial 
agreement upon the main points. One of these 
points is that the old board of education was too 
large, was too carelessly selected, and exercised 
powers that were both too many and too much 
diversified. A second point is that the board should 
be practically kept within legislative limits, and not 
be allowed to roam at will, directly or indirectly, 
over the whole field of administration. The third 
point, and perhaps the most important of all, is that 
executive powers and duties should be entrusted to 
properly qualified executive departments or officers, 
that should have a status clearly recognized by law, 
and so be independent, to a greater or less extent, 
of the action of the board. Every one of these 
new laws recognizes two such departments, and the 
Cleveland law recognizes three. The latter would 
seem to be the proper number. In a report sub- 
mitted to the National Council of Education in 1888, 
I contended that there should be three executive 
departments: the Department of Finance, Ac- 



1899.]

counts, and Records ; the Department of Construc- 
tion, Repairs, and Supplies ; the Department of 
Instruction and Discipline. I contended, further, 
that the heads of these departments might he called 
the auditor, the superintendent of construction, 
and the superintendent of schools ; and that they 
should he men of decided ability and character, 
having each an expert knowledge of the important 
duties committed to their charge. Such modifica- 
tion of this recommendation as is suggested by the 
school director of Cleveland and the business man- 
ager of some of the other cities is perhaps a desir- 
able modification of my former plan. 

On one point the testimony, so far as it goes, is 
quite conclusive ; namely, the great evils" that have 
affected the public schools, so far as they originated 
on the business side of the city system, are mainly 
due to the composition, character, and methods of 
school boards. Of course, conditions existing in the 
cities must be taken into the account ; for the prob- 
lem of city school reform is most distinctly a part 
of the great American problem of the reform of 
municipal government. 

The argument could be strengthened by taking 
account of reform movements that have not yet 
crystalized into legislation. Mention may be made 
of Boston, where the subject of reorganization on 
new lines has attracted sufficient attention to bring 
it before the State legislature. The Report of the 
Chicago School Commission has already been made 
the subject of an elaborate editorial article in this 
journal. The two largest cities of Michigan, De- 
troit and Grand Rapids, are now moving to bring 
the reorganization of their school systems before 
the legislature at the present session. No doubt 
there are other movements that have escaped my 
notice. The general subject is sure to attract the 
increasing attention of the public mind for some 
time to come. What the final type of school organ- 
ization for an American city will be, I do not un- 
dertake to say ; indeed, there is no reason to think 
that there will be, in a close sense of the term, a 
single type of system ; but there is little room to 
doubt that the recent legislation which has been re- 
viewed has been on lines that the future will approve.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

WHY IS POE "REJECTED" IN AMERICA? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A writer who is a " logic machine," who is marked 
by " lack of humor " and " deficient knowledge of human 
nature," is hardly fitted to secure lodgment in the Amer- 
ican heart, though he be " the greatest intellect America 
has produced assuredly the best artist." The writer 
on Poe, in your issue of Jan. 16, should hardly wonder 
at the rejection of such a writer, however he may regret 
it. But, as he seems to remain puzzled by the fact, it 
may be worth while to point out two peculiarities of the 
writings of Poe, pervading them all, though more notice- 



able in his prose tales than in his poems, peculiarities 
which, as I happen to know, have prevented some read- 
ers who fully appreciate his marvellous mastery of lit- 
erary form from taking much delight in him. 

He is astonishingly unrealistic : it is utterly impossible 
to persuade oneself to care much for the outcome of his 
fictions, because we cannot bring ourselves to that degree 
of faith in them which is necessary for sympathy. A 
rapid review of a few typical tales will make this plain; 
and it will be most satisfactory to select for that purpose 
the seven tales lately edited by Professor Perry for 
Poe is entitled to be judged by his best. 

No house ever fell after the manner of the " Fall of 
the House of Usher"; the assertion is true of the story 
as a whole, and of the details generally, from the queer 
observations made by the narrator as he approached the 
house to its final sinking. The weakness of " Ligeia " 
lies not in its being a study of an impossible problem 
the return to life, in another person's body, of a woman 
long dead, but in the unreality of the scenery amid 
which, following his usual taste, the struggle is located. 
The process by which the victim in "The Cask of 
Amontillado " is lured to his doom is certainly thought 
out by a " logic machine," but the only motive for the 
horrible crime is the difference between being injured 
and insulted, disposed of in one sentence of twenty- 
one words. To secure for the story that moderate 
amount of credence which is required for fiction, the 
author should have enlarged upon the insult enough to- 
make it seem possible that such revenge could be taken 
by a human being. Shakespeare did not lead up to the 
murder of Desdemona by saying in one short sentence 
that Othello suspected Cassio. A similar absence of 
reported motive makes it impossible to sympathize with 
the couple who made an " Assignation" to -meet in sui- 
cide. We could care for them by first getting to have 
faith in them; we might actually wish that their pro- 
posed elopement from life might not be thwarted, if we 
knew enough about their past lives and relationships to 
feel that they had indeed become inseparable. The 
" Manuscript found in a Bottle " reports dream-storms 
and dream-waves. The particular " Black Cat " of the 
tale has a way of coming to life after being killed that 
reminds us of the other cat which, the day after being 
beheaded, appeared at the door carrying its head in its 
mouth. The investigations of the hero of " The Gold 
Bug," though certainly told by a perfect " logic ma- 
chine," carry not the slightest conviction, as is discovered 
by the reader who notices that he remains perfectly 
passive; he does not share the excitement of the digger 
for the hid treasure, does not care whether the spade 
turns up gold or sand. And as to the cryptogram, we 
all feel from the very start that it is a " put-up job." 

This strange lack of realism, or naturalness, in all Poe's 
writings for it characterizes his poetry also doubt- 
less results from his " deficient knowledge of human 
nature." And " this effect defective comes by cause." 
It is originally due to a deficient interest in morals. It 
is a sort and a degree of deficiency that becomes a de- 
fect in art; for it is severe criticism on a man's artistic 
quality to assert that his work is not so grounded on 
the passions of mankind as to carry the reader through 
to the end with a vitalizing interest in the outcome. 
This assertion of the artistic importance of morals is 
frequently misunderstood : it has become almost a fash- 
ion to misinterpret it. It is supposed to imply only a 
desire for didactic morality ; but it is simply a demand 
for moral motive as the impelling power of human ac-

tion. We do not demand of Poe, or of any other liter- 
ary man, that he write goody-goody tales, that he aim 
to show "young persons " ho w to live, or mistake Sunday- 
school books for a high type of literature. We only 
rememember that men are supremely interested in the 
moral aspects of life, so that the way to interest one's 
fellows is to appeal to moral motives. It is a maxim of 
art, which should be familiar to every artist in whatsoever 
medium he works, that the moral creates enthusiasm 
and so secures belief. In point of fact, literary illusion 
is obtained by moral warmth rather than by clear-cut 
logical consistency. 

The absence of the moral element from Poe's writings 
will appear the moment one attempts to state the sub- 
jects of bis tales in moral terms. Shakespeare's " Mac- 
beth " is a study of the effect upon a man under tempta- 
tion of the assurance that he can succeed by crime 
the co-working of fatalism and ill-desire. Hawthorne's 
" The Birthmark " works out the results of impatience 
with a slight blemish in what is otherwise perfect. The 
" Fall of the House of Usher " might have shown how 
gloomy anticipations tend to fulfil themselves, if the 
author had not involved stone and mortar in the ruin. 
The problem of " Ligeia " the victory of will over 
death, can be stated, and there would have been a 
satisfactory basis for the action, if Poe could have kept 
to the subject if he had not, as is his wont, over- 
emphasized the eyes, the squirming draperies, and other 
such details, and if he had not confused all moral sense 
by the notion that there was something criminal in taking 
a bride into such an apartment. If the murder included 
in " The Black Cat " is not utterly motiveless, it is at 
least to be hoped that a long time must pass before men 
take to wife - murder with no more rational promptings 
thereto. Comparison of " The Gold Bug " with Stev- 
enson's " Treasure Island " reveals at once the defect in 
Poe: Stevenson leads his reader gradually up to interest 
in the success of the quest, and arouses a distinctly 
moral prejudice, to which much of our interest is due; 
we take sides against the party among whom are to be 
found some of the most cruel of the pirates who had 
by murder and pillage gathered the treasure. 

I do not care to weigh against each other Poe's won- 
derful linguistic perfection and his weakness in that part 
of art which has to do with the gathering and marshall- 
ing of fact and motives. I only wish to remind those 
who are charmed by his mastery of the resources of 
speech that it is vain to expect our people, for the pres- 
ent at least, to everlook the absence of moral motive 
and of consequent realism. For the present: if the 
time ever comes when the creations of the opium-eater's 
imagination are actually born into the world and live 
out their careers, they will be apt to take him " home 
to their business and bosoms," at least they will ad- 
mire the prophetic genius which enabled him to write 
their biographies beforehand. A. C. BARROWS.

SOME CAUSES OF "THE AMERICAN REJECTION 

OF POE." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Is it altogether a matter of unfairness and prejudice 
that American readers as a rule make little of Poe ? 
Surely Griswold's misrepresentations have been so often 
and so convincingly answered by Poe's friends and ac- 
quaintances that no serious student of American letters 
is influenced by their manifest injustice. Does not the 
real reason lie deeper in the nature of the poet him- 



self, and in that of the nation which, as a rule, does not 
read him? 

In fact, your contributor who deplores Poe's non- 
appreciation by the mass of his countrymen has himself 
supplied several good reasons for it. One is his fatal 
lack of humor. Let us take as an example the opening 
lines "To Helen": 

44 1 saw thee once once only years ago ; 

I must not say how many but not many," 
where the attempt at playfulness, taken in connection 
with the rest of the poem, produces an effect that is 
neither more nor less than ludicrous. No man with the 
faintest sense of humor could have been guilty of a 
blunder like that. Now, humor is a warm-hearted, 
kindly quality, which endears a man to his fellows. He 
who does not in some degree possess it must makeshift 
as best he can to dwell in a world apart from human- 
kind; and however this world may be lighted by poetic 
fancy and adorned by imagination, it will after all be 
only a cold moonlit region whose beauty will never com- 
pensate for its loneliness. George Eliot has told us that 
" there is no strain on friendship like a difference of 
taste in jokes," and this is one explanation of the dis- 
tance between Poe and the public whom he failed to 
reach: they had no common ground whereon to stand 
long enough to become acquainted with each other. 

Poe had in him, it is true, " something exotic which 
hinted of another clime and age." Had he lived in 
Persia one or two thousand years ago, some enter- 
prising Orientalist might have discovered him, and 
translated his writings for the benefit of a small but 
enthusiastic circle of readers, and publishers might have 
brought out his works in beautifully bound and illus- 
trated editions de luxe. There is scarcely another nine- 
teenth century author whose works afford scope for 
greater originality in illustration. 

Poe has certain qualities that the most unkindly critics 
cannot deny him: weird and powerful imagination, con- 
structive ability, and exquisite melody of expression in 
both prose and verse. His perception and handling of 
tone-color are unsurpassed by even the greatest of lit- 
erary artists. There are certain lines of his that linger 
in the memory because of their perfect beauty of sound, 
while others come back frequently because of the pic- 
tures they suggest. But to many readers, the realiza- 
tion of Poe's artistic genius is only another source of 
vexation. Great poetry must have great subjects. Per- 
fection of form is not enough, although, in spite of 
Whitman and his followers, some readers will continue 
to think beauty of form one of the essentials of genuine 
poetry. The great poet, however, the poet who lives in 
the hearts of his own countrymen and wins for himself 
a lasting place in the affections of mankind, must voice 
in some effective manner the feelings and thoughts 
common to humanity. This Poe does not do. As he 
does not laugh with those that laugh, neither does he 
weep with those that weep. His weeping he does all 
by himself. In fact, his most musical dirges, with their 
refrains of " the lost Lenore," " beautiful Annabel Lee," 
and- "Ulalume," seem less like the expression of real 
sorrow than complex and finished studies in minor 
chords. One's heart is not touched by them as by such 
simple lines as those in " After the Burial": 
44 There 's a little ridge in the churchyard 
Would scarce stay a child in its race, 
But to me and my thought it is wider 
Than the star-sown vague of space." 
This quatrain is a sincere and beautiful expression of 



1899.]

ill 



human experience. No heart that has shrunk before the 
mystery of death can fail to vibrate in response to it. 
Even pagan Horace appeals to us more than Poe, when 
he says, with sturdy manliness: 

" The sorrow that we cannot cure may yet 
Be lessened by that strength of heart 
That in all trials of our life endures." 
We are a strenuous race, we Anglo-Normans, and this 
girding-up of the loins of the soul in the face of bereave- 
ment has for us far more of pathos than the most mu- 
sical outpourings of self-pity. Herein is Poe's vital 
defect: he indulges too much in self-pity, and is too 
little moved by the sorrows and burdens of the world. 

Poe himself says that " a poem deserves its title only 
inasmuch as it excites by elevating the mind." Whether 
or not it be a defect in our make-up, it must be acknowl- 
edged that for the most part Americans, while we may 
be refreshed and soothed by poems which give us " pure 
beauty " and nothing else, are elevated only by those 
which voice the experiences of our common humanity, 
or call us to high endeavor. And is not one or the other 
or both of these elements to be found in all poems which 
have outlasted the century wherein they were produced ? 

Victor Hugo has told us that " while the poet needs 
wings, he must also have feet "; he must touch the earth 
occasionally, must come near to us, if he would persuade 
us to follow him into the blue ether. So, notwithstand- 
ing Poe's many and varied gifts of the intellect, the poet 
of our hearts will for a long time continue to be some 
other than the poet of " Lenore."

WHAT ARE CRITICS FOR? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A short time ago it fell to the lot of the literary 
editor of one of Chicago's most popular dailies to re- 
view " Aylwin." He had evidently not been informed 
as to the aristocratic parentage of the book, for he 
seized upon it as the work of a green and friendless 
writer, only fitted to be a target for humorous sharp- 
shooting. Accordingly his Procrustean column was 
filled with fragments of gipsy incantations, Welsh dia- 
lect, and mystical jargon, punctuated with sic's and (!)'s, 
and supplemented with a witty commentary reflecting 
ou the sanity of a novelist who expected intelligent peo- 
ple to interest themselves in such a " farrago of non- 
sense," and to read Welsh names where the consonants 
were in such large majority. A few weeks later the 
same newspaper published another review of the same 
book, this time evidently inspired by the publishers, for 
it included all those details about Mr. Watts-Dunton 
which were published (usually in the same words) in 
other so-called critiques : all about his distinguished 
friends, the circumstances under which the book was 
written and published, an authentic key to the charac- 
ters, some remarks on the esoteric popularity of George 
Borrow and the Welsh Gipsies, etc. The Pre-Raphael- 
itism, Neo-Platonism and Post-Zolaism were neatly 
dissected out and identified with the skill of a clinical 
snrgeon, and one knew not which to admire the more: 
the author who had made these dry bones live, or the 
critic who discerned their origin and function. 

We can leave the explanation of such incidents to 
those who know what goes on behind the curtain of 
anonymity. The managing editor is not to be severely 
blamed, since there was nothing to indicate that the two 
reviews pertained to the same subject except the title of 



the book. But whether Deutero-Critic was the same 
individual as the first except for the change of heart, is 
not of importance. What does shock the reader is to 
find that the " literary column " of the average news- 
paper is its most carelessly written department, with 
the exception of the dramatic criticism, which is usually 
worse. The athletic editor, the fashion editor, the culi- 
nary editor, the dermatological editor, the horoscope 
editor, all seem to understand their business and show 
some independence of judgment; but the literary editor 
often shows neither independence nor judgment. 

What is demanded by the reader of the critic is not 
infallibility but responsibility. We will overlook his 
mistakes if we only have his assurance that he is doing 
the best that he can. A critic in discussing Mr. Paul 
Laurence Dunbar's recent novel commented on the curi- 
ous fact that all the characters were colored people; 
another critic called attention to the equally curious fact 
that Mr. Dunbar had introduced no characters of his 
own race, but had written a " white folks' story." Now 
both these critics were above the average, because they 
realized that there is a difference between black and 
white, and they resisted the prevalent tendency to call 
everything gray; and it is probable that one or the other 
of them was partly right. 

It is to be expected that a critic will err, but we wish he 
would not boast of his errancy as Mr. Andrew Lang did 
a few months ago. His attention was called to the fact 
that a book he had condemned in a few careless words 
as unworthy of notice had proved a literary success, and 
in his gracefully facetious way he explains that a critic 
has so little time to give to reading that he cannot be 
expected to know whether a book is good or not, and 
that for his part he does not care whether his judgments 
are correct or false. 

This confession disturbed me a good deal, for I had been 
relying on Mr. Lang's criticisms for many years. A book 
he condemned I always read; and if he attacked a book 
savagely I bought it at once, for I knew it must be 
worth owning. By following this rule I have acquired 
a select library of the world's best literature with not a 
trashy volume in it. But when he says he does not 
know and does not care whether the books he reviews 
are good or bad, my faith in his negative infallibility is 
rudely shaken. I may miss some important work 
through a neglected condemnation on his part. 

A respectable lawyer who, loses a case, the respect- 
able doctor who kills a patient, is properly ashamed of 
it: would it be too much to expect of a respectable 
critic who has pronounced a false judgment or killed 
a good book that he should conceal his glee over the 
achievement? What is a critic for, anyway? Is he to 
be a publisher's echo, a writer of philosophical essays 
with a book for a text, a jester at the author's expense, 
a bric-a-brac collector of second-hand personalities? or 
is it his duty to read new books and tell us what they 
are? We would like to have the critics save us time 
and money by reading .the twenty-five books published 
each day and giving us a trustworthy and impartial 
account of them, so we can tell whether we want to read 
them or not. We are not interested in the critic's likes 
and dislikes, except in so far as we can use them to fore- 
tell our own. If, after the critic has given us the nec- 
essary information, he wants to tell us about how Hall 
Caine plagiarized from the Bible, and Watts-Dunton 
Borrow-ed his Gipsies, we may be interested in that also.

THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD.* 

Fifty years ago everybody that was interested 
in American politics and everybody that read 
newspapers had heard of the Underground 
Railroad. It was much talked of, but not by 
those who knew the most about it. It was as 
mysterious as the Iron Mask, or the Fehm- 
gericht, or the Old Man of the Mountain in 
the middle ages. The phrase was purely meta- 
phorical. There was no railroad, and it was 
not subterranean. There was no corporation ; 
there were no directors, no president, no stock- 
holders, no track, no cars, no engines, no time- 
table, no regular time or place of trains, no 
rates of fare, no tickets ; name everything 
that belongs to a railroad except passengers 
and conductors, and deny the existence of all 
that you have listed, and you will be in the 
right. And the so-called conductors were not 
like real railway conductors. The laws of most 
of the states were against this shadowy elusive 
thing, whatever it was : yet in every community 
where it was known or supposed to exist, some 
of the best men of the community, the most 
upright, men who feared God and wrought 
righteousness, were spoken of as deepest in its 
mysteries, most audacious in its management. 
Can we call the " U. G. R. R." (so the abbre- 
viation ran) an institution ? Slavery was called 
by one of its defenders " our peculiar institu- 
tion "; surely here was the counter peculiar 
institution. 

Slavery was well-organized, had vast wealth, 
had unlimited social support, had special pro- 
visions for its defense in the Constitution 
of the United States, had seats in Congress, 
controlled elections, made presidents, judges, 
and officers of every grade. But the unorgan- 
ized counter-institution, without money, without 
law, without political place or power, like the 
invisible antagonist in the fairy stories who 
carries a magical sword, proved to be such an 
annoying assailant and such a powerful adver- 
sary that it must be reckoned one of the great 
causes of the final ruin of slavery. 

The political importance of the escapes of 
fugitives and of the recovery of them is made

very prominent by the efforts of the South to 
recover slaves under the law of 1793 and to get 
a more stringent law. " Five bleeding wounds ! " 
said the great orator of compromise and con- 
ciliation in 1850, describing the condition of his 
country, " five bleeding wounds ! " counting 
them off on the diverging fingers of his out- 
stretched hand. Benton cynically said that if 
Clay had had more fingers he would have found 
more wounds. But Benton might have spared 
his sneer, as he would have done had he fore- 
seen. Now that the whole matter is half a cen- 
tury away, we can look with sympathy upon 
the efforts of Clay, Calhoun, and Webster 
to avoid the civil war which they believed to be 
imminent. There were indeed bleeding wounds. 
To Clay, one of the fatal five was the action of 
Northern people when they aided fugitives and 
fought the slave-hunters. 

It is wonderful that he could have thought 
Mason's Fugitive-Slave Bill to be a healing 
balm for that gaping wound. The remedy was 
like the old surgery of wounds before the days 
of Ambrose Pare, when caustic potash was ap- 
plied to every cut, " to draw out the peccant 
humors," the creation of which modern science 
finds due to the potash itself. If the law of 1793 
was offensive to the North because of its ten- 
dency to provoke breaches of the peace when 
the slaveholder sought to recover his slave by 
simple " reprisal " (which Blackstone explains 
as one's taking his property wherever he finds 
it), and because it was a cloak for kidnapping 
free men, how could it be supposed that the 
North would peaceably bear an enactment 
which increased both these evils, and contained 
several special and new grievances and provo- 
cations ? The more we have studied the pecu- 
liarities of this law and the results of its enforce- 
ment, and the subsequent career of James M. 
Mason, its author (the Confederate envoy taken 
from the Trent), the more it seems plain that 
it was not intended to make peace, but to lead 
to secession. It was a test measure : if the 
North will stand this, slavery is secure ; if it 
will not, the South will know the next step 
must be secession. The gaping, bleeding wound 
was enlarged ; but slavery, not the nation, died 
of the hemorrhage. 

Clay's curative measures were passed one by 
one : they failed to go through together, as a 
real compromise. Nevertheless, they were called 
the compromises of 1850. The admission of 
California gave an actual majority in the Sen- 
ate to the North, and shattered forever Cal- 
houn's favorite scheme of an equal balance

there. Texas was paid not to make war upon 
the United States, and to yield her claims upon 
New Mexico. All things were indeed settled 
and compromised except Northern conscience 
and love of liberty, and Southern claims of 
property and defense of slavery. With the 
new law to help him, the Southern master or 
his agent made hunting-grounds of the North- 
ern States. He became frequent and very 
obvious. Fugitives who had long rested secure 
in Northern villages and cities or worked on 
Northern farms fled in swift alarm to Canada. 
Their absence was eloquent. Throughout the 
South the rumor spread, and suggested flight 
to daring spirits. As masters talked, slaves 
learned that there were friends of liberty in the 
North as well as officers of oppression. 

In the North every arrest excited greater 
attention, and brought the peculiar institution 
into the blaze of publicity. The Underground 
Railroad increased its business. The South 
and the North grew still more angry with each 
other as collisions were more frequent. North- 
ern states passed " Personal Liberty Laws " 
and other measures within their constitutional 
rights to make recovery difficult. The Supreme 
Court of Wisconsin came into conflict with the 
United States and its Supreme Court. " Uncle 
Tom's Cabin " was written, and sold by thou- 
sands and tens of thousands of copies. Doug- 
las's Kansas and Nebraska Bill poured oil on 
the flames by renewing the political struggle 
and rending the lately victorious Democratic 
party. 

The operators on the Underground grew 
bolder ; for men now winked at or aided them 
who had before denounced them as disturbers 
of the peace and enemies of the public welfare. 
This is well illustrated in the Garner case, in 
Cincinnati, in 1856. Rutherford B. Hayes is 
the relator of the story as given by Professor 
Siebert. Margaret Garner had escaped into 
Ohio with four children, and was hidden near 
Cincinnati. When her master found them, 
she determined to save her little ones from 
slavery by the second of Patrick Henry's alter- 
natives ; she killed the best beloved of her little 
flock, but succeeded no further. Efforts to save 
her from returning to Kentucky all failed : 
even a process against her for murder and vio- 
lation of the law of Ohio was of no avail : the 
property right of the master overrode the crim- 
inal justice of Ohio. Mr. Hayes was living 
on a street full of pro-slavery people ; but this 
tragedy converted them all ; one of the leaders 
among them called on Mr. Hayes at his house 



and declared with great fervor, " Mr. Hayes, 
hereafter I am with you. From this time for- 
ward I will not only be a Black Republican, 
but I will be a damned abolitionist! " Such 
conversions abounded. The execution of the 
law killed it. Moderate men in the North, 
Abraham Lincoln, for example, said the 
slaveholders were entitled to a law for the re- 
covery of their property ; but it must now be 
doubted whether even the allowance of a jury 
trial on the question of identity would have 
calmed the aroused and indignant Northern 
people. 

The great contests of the giants in Congress, 
and the occasional capture of a fugitive like 
Anthony Burns, or Sims, or Jerry of Syracuse, 
were matters of history open to all men ; but 
the underlying cause of much of the commo- 
tion was as secret as a fire in a peat-bog. It 
avoided the publicity that makes history. Now 
and then some daring or skilful escape would 
be told in the Northern newspapers ; but Fred- 
erick Douglas complained that all such narra- 
tions made later escapes more difficult by mak- 
ing masters and hunters aware of the tricks 
and turns and disguises and resting-places of 
the fugitives and their friends. He would not 
tell how he escaped in 1838. Henry Box 
Brown was put into a box three feet long, two 
feet wide, and two feet eight inches deep, and 
so sent by Adams Express from Richmond, 
Va., to Philadelphia. The early and triumph- 
ant publication of the story put an end to such 
escapes, and helped bring the man who had 
boxed Brown, and who had aided fugitives for 
twenty years, to the penitentiary. It was the 
policy of the shrewdest station agents and con- 
ductors to know as little as possible of the work 
of others. 

Hence, it happened that when slavery came 
to an end and there was no reason for further 
concealment, no one could write a history of 
the Underground Railroad. Occasionally some 
actor in this drama behind the scenes would 
relate and publish his reminiscences. There 
are a few interesting books of this sort, as 
the Life of Levi Coffin, or Still's account of 
things noted at Philadelphia, or Dr. R. C. 
Smedley's memoranda of Chester County. The 
men who had been most active were now for 
the most part old and grayheaded men, passing 
rapidly away. Men born sixty years ago had 
not become adult when the drama closed. The 
stories they can now tell are for the most part 
traditions from their elders. Seeing that this 
knowledge must soon be lost, Professor Siebert

[Feb. 16, 



has devoted much time and labor to the collec- 
tion and arrangement of historical matter re- 
lating to the Underground Railroad, which is 
presented in the volume under review. 

Professor Siebert's book is both the most 
extensive and the most comprehensive work of 
all hitherto issued upon this subject. He dis- 
cusses his sources of information ; the origin, 
growth, methods, and managers of the Under- 
ground ; abductions from the South ; fugitives 
in the North and in Canada ; prosecutions 
under the Acts of 1793 and 1850 ; the effects 
of the Underground Railroad in politics and 
otherwise, in discussion of which he affirms that 
" the U. G. R. R. was one of the greatest forces 
which brought on the Civil War and thus de- 
stroyed slavery." He gives thirty-seven pages 
to " the map of the U. G. R. R. system," giv- 
ing one general and five local maps. He gives 
in an appendix the Acts of 1793 and of 1850, 
and the fugitive clauses in the Constitution, in 
the Ordinance of 1787, and in the Missouri 
Compromise ; and adds another appendix giv- 
ing eighty-one important fugitive-slave cases 
with reference to the sources of information 
concerning each. To these he might well have 
added from Wheeler's " Law of Slavery " the 
early case of Avis in Massachusetts, often cited 
as a leading case ; and the cases of Phoebe vs. 
Jay, Borders vs. the People, and Willard vs. the 
People in Illinois. 

Another valuable appendix is an extensive 
bibliography. This ends with " Imaginative 
Works," listing only four, of which one is 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin," and another is Whit- 
tier's Poems. Why not also Longfellow's 
" Poems on Slavery," which preceded Whit- 
tier's first book that had an anti-slavery poem ? 
Why not Lowell ? And for novels, there should 
be named Trowbridge's " Neighbor Jackwood," 
Epes Sargeant's "Peculiar," William L. G. 
Smith's pro-slavery " Uncle Tom's Cabin as it 
is," of which 15,000 copies were sold in fifteen 
days, and Mrs. Stowe's " Dred," called later 
" Nina Gordon ": to these we could add njany 
more of less importance. 

Another appendix of thirty-seven pages is 
called a " Directory of the Names of Under- 
ground-Railroad Operators." The present re- 
viewer is sorry to be obliged to say that unless 
the rest of it is more accurate than certain parts 
that come within his own personal knowledge, 
it is so unreliable as to be practically useless. 
By defect, it omits names that should be there ; 
but this fault is naturally incident to the diffi- 
culty of obtaining information at the present 



time, almost forty years after the secret coali- 
tion ceased operation. 

For example, in Sangamon County, Illinois, 
the station at Farmington, near the present 
Farmingdale, had operators Rev. Bilious Pond, 
Deacon Lyman, and Messrs. Estabrook and 
Low ; and the knowing ones sent fugitives 
thither rather than to pro-slavery Springfield, 
though the capital was honored by the residence 
of Luther Ransom, a fearless and active Gar- 
risonian. These names are not given ; but 
three names are given for Sangamon, of so 
little fame that only surnames represent two of 
them. So in Morgan, Henry Irving and W. C. 
Carter, the principal " coachmen " from Jack- 
sonville, are unnamed, as well as Julius A. 
Willard, whose name is found in our Supreme 
Court Reports. In the same volume with 
Willard's case appeared the case and name of 
Andrew Borders of Randolph, not listed. Pro- 
fessor Siebert may be excused for not getting 
these names ; but their absence may show that 
such a list or " directory " cannot be made. 

Again, men are listed who never were Under- 
ground Railroad operators, but were known only 
as anti-slavery men, and perhaps lukewarm as 
such. The reviewer knew Morgan County 
pretty well, and can say that the three names 
given for that county should have no place 
there. Still worse, in the list for Jersey County 
are three names that belong to Morgan ; and 
one of those had no active connection with the 
movement. Of the remaining four names in 
Jersey, who would recognize in the Frenchy 
name " Garesche " the sturdy Yankee miller, 
Joseph Gerrish ? In Henry County, William 
T. Allan (not Allen) appears also as William 
S. Allen, non-existent. McLean is honored 
with the single name of Deacon Moss ; but this 
is the same man as the " Dea. Mark Morse " of 
Woodford, " Mt. Hope Station," on the road in 
1840. Charles Lippincott never lived in Ran- 
dolph, but in Madison and Bond. There is a 
very suspicious identity of three names in the 
Bond County list of Illinois and the Bond 
County list of Indiana. 

Leaving Illinois, where more defects could be 
shown, let us go to Pennsylvania. Here, from 
the list for Chester County, J. Williams Thorne 
should be transferred to Lancaster, where he 
is erroneously given as I. William Thorne. 
Enoch Walker should be given to Montgomery ; 
Philip and Benjamin Price should be taken 
from Delaware to Chester, where one of them 
is listed as Pierce. Other changes should be 
made in that region ; and Mahlon Brosius 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

should be added to Chester. Forty-two per 
cent of the " Directory " is given to Ohio, which 
is probably nearer to accuracy. But the " Di- 
rectory " and the maps are tentative, partial, 
and defective : a true map cannot be made. 

Let not this criticism of the weak point of 
the book (weak because its author attempted 
what no man can now do) obscure or hide 
from our readers the fact that Professor Sie- 
bert's work is the great work on its subject, 
the book to which writers on American his- 
tory must hereafter look as the best summary 
of information. It is an honest and laborious 
attempt to gather the facts of the time ; and 
they are skilfully classified and arranged. 
There is no superflous rhetoric. It must have 
cost the writer an effort to omit the romance 
of the Underground Railroad, the marvellous 
stories of escapes and perils which would have 
made the volume more readable, but would 
have made it less a sober and self-contained 
history. For those incidents one must go to 
Still and S medley and Coffin and the like. The 
present reviewer, who heard Garrison lecture 
sixty-eight years ago to a scanty audience, and 
who was an interested observer and an active 
sharer in the an ti- slavery contest to its close, is 
glad to see a presentation of one of the greatest 
agencies of the conflict so suitable to its import- 
ance and so worthy of praise. 

The last paragraph of the text speaks of " the 
cancellation of the slave clause in the Consti- 
tution by the amendment of that instrument." 
This is a not uncommon error. But that clause 
is not cancelled. If a duly-bound apprentice 
or a person who has made a contract to labor 
for a specified time should run away from Ohio 
into Indiana, under this still-valid clause the 
injured party could reclaim the fugitive, whom 
no law of Indiana could release from his obli- 
gation . This clause, used for the benefit of the 
slaveholder, is valid without slavery, and is a 
condensed form of a similar provision in the 
instrument of union of the New England col- 
onies in 1643, which was meant for indentured 
servants ; though after their treaty of 1650 
with New York, it was extended to that Dutch 
colony, and it is reported that under it one 
slave was reclaimed. 

The book is well printed, and is, except in a 
few proper names, free from typographical 
errors : it has thirty-eight pages of index. 
Having been so interested in the work as to read 
every page of its text, the reviewer congratu- 
lates Professor Siebert upon the completion of 
his monumental labor. SAMUEL WILLARD. 



SOME RECENT BOOKS ON. EDUCATION.* 

General Francis A. Walker was known to 
the country in many ways ; he was a man of 
varied talents and diversified activities. Per- 
haps it would not be an easy matter to rate his 
ability and the value of his work, relatively, 
in the several spheres of action in which he 
figured. He was a soldier of the Union and 
the historian of important phases of the Civil 
War ; he was superintendent of the National 
Censuses of 1870 and 1880 ; he was a student 
of economics, and the writer of valuable eco- 
nomical books ; and he was a practical educator. 
All this was well known to the public ; but we 
assume that the extent and value of his contri- 
butions to educational discussion were not 
equally well known. We have now before us 
the evidence of his work in this department of 
activity, in the solid and beautiful volume en- 
titled " Discussions in Education," which is 
made up of his occasional addresses and papers. 
It is a fitting memorial to its author, and a 
fresh evidence of the country's loss in his un- 
timely death. 

General Walker was a man of varied educa- 
tional experience, serving at different times as a 
college tutor, a college professor, and President 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He also served on the Boston School Board, 
and probably in other similar administrative 
offices. The breadth of his experience, as well 
as the natural range of his mind, are reflected 
in these " Discussions." The subjects dealt with 
are all live and practical subjects ; the author 
was apparently too busy to deal with educa- 
tion under its historical or philosophical aspects. 
The contents are grouped by the editor under

four heads: "Technological Education," " Man- 
ual Education," " The Teaching of Arithme- 
tic," and " College Problems." But General 
Walker never deals with his subject in a nar- 
row or so-called " practical " way ; right or 
wrong, he always has his eye fixed on some 
valuable educational end. Nor does he tumble 
into the pitfall that always yawns for the spe- 
cialist. For example, he writes : 

" My own opinion is that engineering education is 
primarily and principally an educational and not an en- 
gineering problem; and that the judgment of a strong 
and experienced teacher who has studied this problem 
is more likely to be right than that of any engineer 
without experience as a teacher, however eminent he 
may be in his profession." 

Again, he does not find the value of industrial 
education in special utilities, but writes : 

" I heartily believe that the introduction of the me- 
chanic arts, and of sewing and cooking, into the public 
schools, will do much, very much, not only to increase 
the interest of the pupils in their work, as has been 
already indicated, but to win for the schools a far larger 
degree of interest on the part of parents and a far 
heartier support of the system on the part of the general 
community." 

And again, speaking of manual training : . 

" I care comparatively little for its influence upon 
eye or hand. Its chief work in my view is educational; 
and in that educational work I place foremost its power 
of rectifying the mind itself, of straightening the crooked 
limb, so to speak, of strengthening the weak joint, 
of healing the lesion, which, if not cured, will proceed 
to deep and irreparable injury." 

President Gilman's " University Problems," 
like General Walker's " Discussions in Edu- 
cation," consists of the more weighty utterances 
of its author, during the last twenty-five years 
or more, on educational subjects. Most of 
these utterances originally took the form of 
public addresses ; and such form they still re- 
tain. The book is a valuable contribution to 
educational discussion. Here the reader will 
find the resources and ideals, the methods and 
field, of Johns Hopkins University, with some- 
thing of its history, clearly set forth by its 
President. President Gilman throws out one 
original suggestion relative to a National uni- 
versity that may yet prove to be highly import- 
ant. It is, that the Smithsonian Institution 
shall " organize a plan by which the literary 
and scientific institutions of Washington may 
be associated and correlated so far, and so far 
only, as relates to the instruction and assist- 
ance, under proper guidance, of qualified stu- 
dents." There will be no difficulty, he assures 
us, about the funds if this were done. As we 
understand him, this is the scheme that Dr. 
Gilman has in mind in this passage : 



" If the university in Washington could be so ordered 
that all the scientific resources of the nation were avail- 
able for study, under the guidance of competent per- 
sons, without reference to honors, and without formal 
and prolonged curricula, very many well-qualified schol- 
ars some who have graduated, and some who have 
never been in college; men and women; foreigners and 
Americans; some in early and some in later life 
would there be gathered, and would be aided, taught, 
and inspired by the opportunities and influences thrown 
open to them, in an amplitude worthy of the National 
Capital." 

Professor Russell is fully justified in assum- 
ing, as he does in his preface to " German 
Higher Schools," that there was room in our 
pedagogical literature for a new book on the 
subject. As he tells us, German elementary 
schools and German universities have become 
familiar to American educators, but the sec- 
ondary schools, which could be studied by us 
with still greater advantage, are much less 
known. Not only has he discovered the want, 
but he has gone far toward meeting it : still, no 
one book could meet it fully. One hundred and 
seven pages of his handsome volume are given 
to an historical account of German education 
and schools, from the days of Columban and 
Boniface to the present time, and the remainder 
to an exposition of the existing system of sec- 
ondary education. The work is not closely 
confined, however, to secondary schools, and, if 
it were to be a good one, could not be ; it must 
present the subject in its relations to other 
parts of the educational system. The author 
shows wide reading on his subject and skilful 
use of the note-book. He sprinkles quotation 
over his pages most plentifully, but he so 
weaves them into his narrative or exposition as 
not seriously to impair the unity of his compo- 
sition. But, what is more to the purpose, he 
shows, when dealing with the secondary schools 
as they now exist, a large first-hand knowledge, 
obtained by personal visitation of schools and 
conference with teachers and educational au- 
thorities. There is no work in the English 
language known to us that contains so much 
and so valuable information about the second- 
ary schools of Germany. Nor is the book a 
book of facts merely ; the author has an eye 
also for ideas and forces, and conducts his his- 
torical narration with constant reference to 
these factors. 

We do not know how it may be with Rug- 
beans or other British readers, but it is pretty 
safe to say that such Americans as read Mr. 
Rouse's " History of Rugby School " will find 
the centre of interest in the external rather 
than the internal features, as he portrays them, 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

of that famous school. While these readers 
have a considerable knowledge of the interior 
work and life of a great English public school, 
they generally know little of its exterior his- 
tory. We cannot say that, under this aspect, 
Rugby is a typical school ; undoubtedly, these 
institutions present many points of difference, 
but, after all, the great public schools, as well 
as the large class to which they belong that 
is, the endowed schools must have much ex- 
ternal history in common. Mr. Rouse has, in 
general, presented this side of his subject with 
commendable fulness. 

When Lawrence Sheriffe, member of the 
Worshipful Company of Grocers, and grocer 
to Queen Elizabeth, died in 1567, he left be- 
hind him a will and accompanying documents, 
in which Rugby School had its origin. He 
was a Rugbean by birth, and, having prospered 
in business, wished to leave to his native town 
a legacy that would be productive of lasting 
good. So he left to George Harrison and 
Barnard Field, trustees, three pieces of prop- 
erty : A mansion house that he had built at 
Rugby, together with the land round about it, 
*' being altogether one rood thirty poles or 
thereabouts "; the parsonage of Brown so ver, 
near Rugby, " with one yard of glebe, more or 
less, and the tithes "; and one-third of " the 
field hard by Holborn, some half mile outside 
of London, commonly called Conduit Close or 
Conduit Mead," these pieces of property 
being devoted to the founding of an almshouse 
and a public school. The potency of Rugby 
lay in the piece of meadow land. This was at 
the time of comparatively little value, but it 
was by and by swallowed up by the great me- 
tropolis and so became a source of great and 
increasing wealth to the double foundation. 
Although Lawrence Sheriffe added a codicil to 
his will, and then fortified both documents with 
an " intente," he still left the business in great 
confusion. As we have seen, the foundation 
was double, and it was a long time before the 
school and the almshouse could be fully sepa- 
rated ; the founder stated his intentions and 
wishes in a vague and general manner, not even 
providing for the succession of the trusteeship ; 
while some of his relatives who had some slight 
claims upon his estate did all that they could 
do to destroy the trust altogether. What with 
an imperfect devise, indifferent or incompetent 
trustees, suits and commissions in equity, acts 
of Parliament, and greedy heirs, it was not a 
little remarkable that the foundation ever be- 
came a great school, or even survived at all. 



This point we had in mind when we spoke 
above of the external history of Rugby. Of the 
many hundreds of school endowments made in 
England in the sixteenth century, some, and 
probably many, must have perished utterly, or 
have been wholly diverted from their purpose, 
by causes similar to those that came so near to 
wrecking Rugby. 

Still, the view that we get of the interior of 
the school is by no means without interest. 
Dealing with the new spirit introduced by Dr. 
Arnold, the author sets forth his own view, as 
well as Arnold's, of one important feature of 
school discipline : 

" Arnold did not in the least suffer from that false 
sentimentally common in our own generation, which 
condemns all corporeal punishment as degrading. There 
can be no degradation when none is felt, and ordinary 
boys, as every practical teacher will admit, feel none in 
corporeal punishment. They hail it, rather, as far pre- 
ferable to long and monotonous impositions; if judi- 
ciously and calmly administered, it never leaves a grudge 
behind, as impositions often do." 

The reader of this passage would naturally 
expect to find Mr. Rouse defending fags and 
fagging, and this he does. He tells us that : 

" It raises a smile to read what some eminent edu- 
cationalists have written of the fagging system, as 
though it were a thing essentially bad, and only to be 
tolerated because it cannot be abolished. If it be essen- 
tially bad, that the young should serve before they can 
rule, then the whole system of government in all organ- 
ized countries, and in the army and navy, and in com- 
merce, is essentially bad. Experience shows that the 
fagging system, if properly limited, is a good and use- 
ful institution, and an excellent training in habits of 
smartness and obedience." 

There may be some shadow of truth in this 
view of the subject, but the fagging system will 
disappear, and future masters of Rugby, suc- 
cessors of Mr. Rouse, will wonder that he ever 
defended it. 

Mr. Graham Balfour has attempted to 
describe the three grades of education in the 
four countries, England, Ireland, Scotland, 
and Wales. He defines his purpose as not to 
write a history of education, but to give " an 
account of the framework of which education 
is the life and spirit." " I have had," he says, 
" to deal only with the dry bones, for the first 
and most pressing need was a picture of the ex- 
isting skeleton." Skeletons, even if grinning 
and ghastly, are of the first importance to all 
systems, and of great interest to all students of 
anatomy. This book might be described, there- 
fore, as a treatise on the educational anatomy 
of the four countries just named. We do not 
see how the author could have done his work 
better than he has done it. He has ranged 



118 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



over the whole field for facts, and has presented 
them in a manner that shows decided power of 
analysis and combination. It is hard to see 
how more information could have been put in 
the same compass, or how what is here found 
could have been presented in clearer or more 
concise language. The book is one that all 
students of education in Great Britain and 
Ireland will find most useful, if not indispens- 
able. Still, we have some fear that readers 
who have not some considerable previous knowl- 
edge of the subject will find it too solid and 
compact for their purpose. But compendiums 
are not written, or should not be written, for 
novices. 

Mr. Balfour's book illustrates in a striking 
way the extraordinary variety of schools exist- 
ing in the four countries named, and especially 
in England and Wales, which, for the purposes 
of elementary teaching, are subject to the same 
laws. Even the reader who is already familiar 
with the field that is, if he lives on this side 
of the ocean will be impressed again by the 
utter absence of controlling ideas and princi- 
ples, and the absolute predominance of empir- 
icism and precedent, in British education. He 
will also be impressed again by the progress of 
elementary instruction in recent years. Govern- 
ment grants began with 20,000 in 1833 ; they 
amounted to 800.000 in 1860, and reached 
9,000,000 in 1897. Nor were the rates, or 
local taxes as we should call them, which 
amounted to nearly 5,000,000, counted in the 
sum given for the last year. Mr. Balfour 
counts the educational fund from public grants, 
endowments, and other sources, for Great 
Britain and Ireland, at fully 20,000,000 an- 
nually ; and estimates that this sum will have 
to be considerably increased before existing 
wants are met. 

The title-page of " Work and Play in Girls' 
Schools " suggests that the book is wholly the 
work of the three head-mistresses named, all of 
whom have at some time been members of the 
teaching staff of the Cheltenham Ladies' Col- 
lege. But such is not the fact : many other 
writers have contributed to the volume. Nor 
are Miss Soulsby and Miss Dove relatively 
prominent ; the one writes the section on the 
" Moral Side of Education " and the other that 
on the " Cultivation of the Body." The veteran 
Miss Beale is much the most abundant con- 
tributor to the book. The aim of the authors 
is to cover the whole field of girls' education. 
Some of the pedagogy that it contains is rather 
antiquated, and some of the exercises recom- 



mended are useless ; but on the whole it is a book 
of solid value and breathes a wholesome spirit. 
It may be observed that Miss Beale keeps her 
good old English faith in examinations un- 
shaken. She argues with old-time confidence, 
and with perfect truth that, provided examina- 
tions are rightly conducted, they are useful as a 
test of what we really know ; that preparation 
for them enables us to find out what are our 
permanent possessions ; that competitive exam- 
inations compel us to set these possessions in 
order and estimate their relative importance ; 
that examinations tend to produce presence of 
mind and mental self-control ; that they sup- 
press wordiness and abolish a florid style, and 
tend to make us feel the supreme importance 
of clearness and accuracy. All the current 
arguments against examinations that are now 
so popular are based on their abuses. 

It is generally agreed among scholars that no 
better university work in history is now any- 
where done than in Paris. This fact will give 
importance to the " Introduction to the Study 
of History," quite apart from its intrinsic 
merits. MM. Langlois and Seignobos are lec- 
turers on history at the Sorbonne, and they give 
us in this book, as we understand the matter, 
the view of history and the general method of 
studying it that are now in favor at this cele- 
brated seat of learning. They intend to go to 
the bottom of things, as this paragraph from 
their preface will show : 

" We propose to examine the conditions and the 
methods, to indicate the character and the limits, of his- 
torical knowledge. How do we ascertain, in respect of 
the past, what part of it is possible, what part of it is 
important, to know ? What is a document ? How are 
documents to be treated with a view to historical work ? 
What are historical facts ? How are they to be grouped 
to make history ? Whoever occupies himself with his- 
tory performs, more or less unconsciously, complicated 
operations of criticism and construction, of analysis and 
synthesis. But beginners, and the majority of those 
who have never reflected on the principles of historical 
methodology, make use, in the performance of these 
operations, of instinctive methods which, not being, in 
general, rational methods, do not usually lead to scien- 
tific truth. It is, therefore, useful to make known and 
logically justify the theory of the truly rational methods 
a theory which is now settled in some parts, though 
still incomplete in points of capital importance." 

The keynote of the work is that history is a 
science. Mr. York Powell, in introducing it 
to English readers, strikes this note in this 
manner : 

" It is not an historian's question, for instance, whether 
Napoleon was right or wrong in his conduct at Jaffa, or 
Nelson in his behavior at Naples; that is a matter for 
the student of ethic or the religious dogmatist to decide. 
All that the historian has to do is to get what conclusion 



1899.]

119 



he can get out of the conflict of evidence, and to decide 
whether Napoleon or Nelson actually did that of which 
their enemies accuse them, or, if he cannot arrive at 
fact, to state probability, and the reasons that incline 
him to lean to the affirmative or to the negative." 

The meaning of this is that the historian is to 
look upon the actions of men just as the geolo- 
gist looks upon the eruptions of a volcano and 
the spouting of a hot spring. " The historian 
very properly furnishes the ethical student with 
material," Mr. Powell tells us further, " though 
it is not right to reckon the ethical student's 
judgment upon the historian's facts as history 
in any sense." This ideal, we venture to say, 
is both false and impossible. The kind of man 
that Napoleon or Nelson was, is an historical 
question ; and neither one is to be studied as 
though he were an elemental non-moral force. 
That, no doubt, was Napoleon's own view of 
the matter. The first duty of the historian, and 
one hitherto much neglected, is to get at the 
facts ; but, this done, he is to seek out their 
causes and interpretation. Moreover, the char- 
acter of the man himself is a factor in this sec- 
ondary process. Our authors have produced a 
strong book, and one that we gladly recom- 
mend to students and teachers of history ; but 
we protest that history is not one of the natural 
sciences. B. A. HINSDALE. 



CURRENT THEATRICAL, CRITICISM.* 



It is not the custom of our dramatic critics 
to collect and publish their works. You may 
go into any well-appointed bookstore and ask 
for Mr. Alan Dale's " Life and the Stage," or 
Mr. Franklin Fyles's " Sunlight and Foot- 
lights," but you will not get them, for they do 
not exist. So many libraries consider it re- 
spectable to bind the " New York Tribune " 
that Mr. William Winter's views will be always 
accessible ; and now that Mr. Norman Hap- 
good has taken to the magazines, he is safe for 
immortality. But as a rule the press comments, 
even on our " metropolitan " stage, are breathed 
forth but once into the great expanse of news- 
paper readers, and after a day or so are as if 
they had never been. In other countries, men 
are more or less in the habit of publishing their 
theatrical criticism ; and this is a good thing, 
on the whole, for it dignifies the tone of criti- 
cism and of the stage as well. So it is of some

Some Modern Plays. By L. Dupont Syle. New York :

by W. Strunk, Jr. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



interest that Mr. Dupont Syle should have 
broken the ice in the matter.* His " Essays 
in Dramatic Criticism " contain two different 
kinds of work, first, a number of essays on 
general dramatic subjects ; and second, several 
critical notices of current plays. 

It is curious, if nothing more, that the stage 
which forms the object of Mr. Syle's criticism 
should be that of San Francisco. That will 
explain the fact that of the fifteen plays that 
he speaks of, not a single one can really be 
said to be of any permanent interest. The best 
known of them are " Trilby," " Shore Acres," 
and " The Geisha "; these, people have heard 
of and still remember ; the others were either 
never known at all or are now forgotten. Many, 
many people live in places Cone-night stands) 
where the " Opera House " offers very few real 
attractions ; but few who have any dramatic 
possibilities at all have gazed on a list of 
plays of less interest to anybody except the 
inexperienced and the confirmed theatre-goer. 
Yet in this very fact (and I think that Mr. 
Syle appreciates it perfectly) lies the chief 
interest of this book. Mr. Syle is a pretty well 
equipped dramatic critic ; he has seen good 
acting here and abroad, he is a professor of 
literature and therefore familiar with the great 
dramatists, he has the disposition and reading 
of a critic. Now, if a competent critic happen 
to live in San Francisco (or near it) what is he 
to do ? Keep quiet ? Certainly not : let him 
criticize anything in sight. A good critic should 
be something like a good portrait-painter : he 
should work on the material at hand, and not 
always demand the brightest and best. Prob- 
ably the men that Rembrandt and Franz 
Hals painted would have seemed commonplace 
enough to us, at least some of them. A good 
critic will have something to say about almost 
anything. 

These criticisms, then, were very interesting 
to me, although I do not think that I should 
have cared much about the plays. I do not 
know that they would be interesting to every- 
body, for doubtless a great part of my interest 
might be called (with an unintentional double 
meaning) professional. Perhaps the general 
run of people would not care to read about plays 
that they have never seen and never wish to see 
and for which they care absolutely nothing. It 
may be so ; and yet Mr. Syle has written well 
concerning them, written on a high plane, but 

* It seems hardly possible, in these days of republication, 
that no one should have done so before, so I am prepared to 
be wrong in this matter. But it is certainly an uncommon 
practice.

easily and quite without pedantry or conven- 
tionalism. 

I suppose it may be urged against these 
critiques that they are " too literary." I think I 
have heard this expression used of dramatic crit- 
icism, although I am not at all sure that I know 
just what it means. Mr. Syle rather lays him- 
self open to this allegation, for the first essays 
in the book (Essays as distinguished from Im- 
pressions) are undoubtedly " literary " in char- 
acter. The longest is an indication of the 
influence of Moliere on Congreve and Sheridan, 
good in itself, and perhaps rather better if it 
should lead anyone to carry on the inquiry and 
ask whether we can trace any influence of 
Moliere and Congreve and Sheridan upon Mr. 
Pinero and Mr. Henry Arthur Jones. The 
four other essays are much shorter ; pleasant 
reading, but without much novelty of idea. The 
last may perhaps be excepted ; Mr Syle, in 
comparing our stage with the Elizabethan 
drama, shows how several of the popular ele- 
ments of the latter, poetry, eloquence, history, 
have of late found better means of expression 
than the drama. So far he is quite right ; 
probably right also when he says that the chief 
distinctive element of the art of the present 
playwright is the construction of situation, 
and explains thus the popularity of the farce, 
wherein situation is the chief dependence. If 
this be so, however, I hardly follow Mr. Syle 
in thinking that with a decrease in our present 
commercialism, the drama will again take to 
itself " the poetical and ethical elements which 
we see flourishing in the works of the great 
playwrights." It may well be that in that 
millennium the drama will find that possession 
is nine points of the law. 

But to return to the criticism of contempo- 
rary plays. Whether the general reader be 
interested in such essays or not, it would be 
rather for the better, so far as the stage is con- 
cerned, if he were interested and if there were 
more such books as this. We have, nowadays, 
so many books anyway that a few more could 
at least do no harm. And books like this are 
in the way of doing good in so far as they tend 
to raise the tone of our theatrical criticism, both 
on the part of the critics and of play-goers as 
well. There is no doubt that, critics or not, 
people will keep on going to the theatre, and 
generally to see what they like. But there can 
be no doubt either that they will also continue 
to talk about the plays they have seen and 
therein find a great part of their pleasure. You 
buy a ticket and see a play ; but that is only 



the beginning of your good time. After the 
play there is always a fresh interchange of 
opinion or repartee at the theatre supper or in 
the street- car going home. Then for a week 
or so there is the constant, " Have you seen 
this or that ? " " Well, my dear, what did you 
think of it?" "Weren't the dresses," etc., 
a sort of conversation which, independently of 
the weight of opinion expressed, is generally 
pleasant to the conversers. And then after- 
ward, for a longer or shorter time, there is the 
general impression left by a play and its acting, 
rarely taking definite form but usually present, 
the impression which does most (when anything 
at all is done) to influence taste and character. 
Everybody knows this, and yet nobody to speak 
of thinks much of it. With a book, a picture, 
a piece of music, we all think opinion is im- 
portant enough to be worth our attention. Ah, 
but these are opinions on the great books, the 
great pictures, the great music, not of mere 
contemporary appearances,. True enough ; but 
of the great plays as acted plays, we can never 
have anything but contemporary criticism. 
Hence, if we are going to have dramatic criti- 
cism at all, it must be from day to day, and 
just as it is worth while to have criticism of 
literature, painting, music, so it is worth while 
to have some criticism of the drama. Not that 
people may thus get the right opinions ready 
made and so know what to think, but that they 
may have a chance to form for themselves more 
definite ideas and standards than they can easily 
do now, when popular theatrical criticism is 
largely impromptu and a matter of accident. 
Let anyone think whether novel-reading would 
be as much fun as it is now had we never read 
any literary criticism ; whether paintings would 
be so absorbing to us if we had never read a 
word about the art of the great painters. And 
let anyone think, too, whether " good music " 
would not be more truly attractive to many if 
people ever read any musical criticism. Criti- 
cism of anything arouses interest ; it makes us 
notice what had before escaped notice ; it gives 
a chance for opinion either by agreement or 
disagreement ; it encourages thought. So I saw 
Mr. Syle's book with pleasure, just as I see 
with pleasure the gradually increasing custom 
of publishing plays in real books. Both tend 
toward the creation of a more active, a sounder 
state of public opinion than we have now ; and 
this is the first thing necessary to having better 
plays and better acting. When people want 
the best, they will generally find a way to get it. 
A farther view of this book is suggested by

another, published a little while ago, namely, 
Dryden's " Essays on the Drama," edited by W. 
Strunk, Jr. This is an excellent little book. It 
contains the essay " Of Dramatic Poesy," the 
" Defence " of the Essay, and the essay " Of 
Heroic Plays," with very good apparatus. Mr. 
Strunk has done his work thoroughly ; he gives 
(besides the usual biographical facts and notes 
on style and allusions) a history of the discus- 
sion of which these essays were a part, an ac- 
count of Dryden's sources and authorities, an 
index of plays cited, and, in his notes, a pretty 
constant comparison of Dryden's opinions with 
the classics of criticism of his time. The book 
gives a good opportunity for an introduction 
to Dryden's dramatic criticism. 

In the presence of a fairly definite body of 
dramatic criticism as you will find in Drydeu, 
one inclines to look to Mr. Syle to see what 
are the principles on which his remarks rest. 
It is true that Dryden's criticism was the criti- 
cism of a man who was more interested in 
writing plays than in seeing them acted. It is 
true also that he spent most of his energy upon 
the development of the action and on the ques- 
tion of rhyme ; and further, it will be allowed 
that Dryden was in his criticism too much 
bound to precedent for the best results. Still, 
it is of interest to have bases of criticism, un- 
less you mean to have absolutely impressionistic 
criticism. 

Mr. Syle does not give us impressionistic 
criticism : he gives what he calls " impressions," 
but they are really more like opinions, judg- 
ments. Now, without differing especially with 
many of these opinions, I should much like to 
know the guiding principles. " For instance, 
Mr. Syle says, " Constructively the play is 
well made " (p. 94), although it afterwards 
appears that the first and fourth acts are the 
strong acts, while in the second and third acts 
" there is nothing that one could not foresee 
after listening to the opening speeches." Else- 
where he says, " It is a thousand pities that 
the author who could conceive such a character 
had not imagination enough to set it forth in 
truly poetic form " (p. 104), whereas another 
play of apparently the same kind is at fault 
because its dialogue has not " a shred of wit, 
humor, or anything but a surface observation 
of life " (p. 94). I do not mean to be captious 
or hypercritical in calling attention to these 
remarks, but I find it hard to see from them 
just what kind of construction, what kind of 
dialogue, Mr. Syle thinks good. If I did see, 
if I got at the fundamentals, I might improve 



my own ideas. I do not myself think that con- 
struction is very good which permits us to fore- 
see the end of an act from the beginning. I 
have not, as a rule, thought that we could ask 
for poetic charm in the presentation of the 
characters in a melodrama, nor much wit or 
humor in its dialogue. But if I have been 
wrong, it would surely be interesting to me to 
have some definite bases on which I could carry 
out a re-accommodation. 

But perhaps everyone (else) knows all about 
such things already.

IDEALIST'S IDEAS or EVIL.* 

Professor Royce's latest book is a series of 
essays, more or less related to each other, and 
all bearing upon the general subject of Good 
and Evil. As might have been expected from 
the author's previous works, his point of view 
is that of the ethical idealist. This does not 
mean that Professor Royce is an idle dreamer, 
vaguely explaining away the essential differ- 
ences between right and wrong. On the con- 
trary, he looks facts squarely in the face and 
holds closely to the realities of everyday human 
life. He is an ethical idealist in that he inter- 
prets the universe as a realm whose significance 
lies in the ethical ideals which its processes 
realize. 

Of all the problems of life, none are more 
baffling and intricate than the one which per- 
tains to the existence of Evil. If God be good, 
why does He permit Evil ? is a question that 
in one form or another has perplexed every 
thoughtful being. It is the question which 
Professor Royce attempts to answer. To put 
the matter in concrete form, he takes the case 
of Job as illustrating the experience of suffer- 
ing humanity. To Job, this world is the work 
of a Being who ought to be intelligent and 
friendly to righteousness. Yet this God seems 
at times to show himself just the reverse. What 
is the explanation? After considering vari- 
ous familiar answers which have been given as 
solutions to the problem that Evil is but 
transient discipline, that without Evil there 
could be no free-will, that we see only in part 
and a complete view would justify the belief 
that Evil is but partial good, Professor Royce 
gives his own interpretation. He regards Evil 



* STUDIES OF GOOD AND EVIL. By Josiah Royce. New 
York : D. Appleton & Co.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



as a real fact, and holds that its existence is not 
only consistent with the perfection of the world, 
but is necessary for the very existence of that 
perfection. As the hero could never be hero 
without controlling fear and pain ; as the saint 
could never be saint without overcoming temp- 
tations to sin, so a knowledge of Good is possi- 
ble only as one knows Evil and subordinates it 
to the Good. " If moral Evil were simply de- 
stroyed and wiped away from the external 
world, the knowledge of moral goodness would 
also be destroyed," is the language of Professor 
Royce. This reminds one of St. Thomas's fam- 
ous argument for the existence of God. " It 
has been asked," says St. Thomas, " if there 
is a God, whence comes Evil? We should 
rather conclude thus : If there is Evil there is 
a God, for Evil would have no existence with- 
out order in the Good, the privation of which 
is Evil. But there would not be this order if 
God did not exist." Professor Royce holds that 
Job's problem is insoluble upon Job's presup- 
position, which is that God is an external 
creator and ruler, for in this case God is either 
cruel or helpless. Only when one regards God 
as the essence and fulness of all Being, abso- 
lutely one with humanity, suffering in its pain 
and triumphing in its victory, can there be any 
satisfactory solution of the problem. God is 
not the Infinite One beyond the finite imper- 
fections, but the being whose unity determines 
the very constitution, the tension and relative 
disharmony of the finite world, and so the ex- 
istence of Evil is not only consistent with the 
perfection of the universe, but is necessary for 
the very existence of that perfection. 

To the student of Hegel, this theory of the 
justification of Evil is not new ; nor does Pro- 
fessor Royce offer it as such. The merit of the 
essay is that the most difficult of problems is 
handled in a clear and masterly way, and the 
solution given is in accordance with the views 
of some of the ablest thinkers of the present 
time. 

Professor Royce again states his fundamental 
theory in an essay on " Tennyson and Pessim- 
ism." He defends the position that " Locksley 
Hall Sixty Years After," although artistically 
inferior to the first " Locksley Hall," is ethi- 
cally higher, and, contrary to general opinion, 
far more satisfactory. The complaint is made 
by the author that while Tennyson is one of the 
most devout of men, he gives as his ideal some- 
thing that can be realized only through a more or 
less complete separation from the world of con- 
crete life. The God in whom Tennyson believes 



is a God that hides himself, or shows himself 
only on rare or romantic occasions to the devout. 
In no sense is he the God of the present. He 
is the God of the future. This is shown in the 
first " Locksley Hall." The young man is in 
the old romantic world on a quest for the ideal. 
He has nothing to do with the commonplace. 
His business is important, but vague and inde- 
scribable. Its prominent feature is that it 
takes him away from earthly relations to move 
forward, and neither he nor anyone else knows 
exactly where. This romantic idealism Pro- 
fessor Royce claims leads eventually to pessim- 
ism ; and the pessimism of the second "Locks- 
ley Hall," so far as it is pessimistic, is the 
explicit statement of what is implied in the first. 
The thought is, Unless God is here, how do 
you know he is elsewhere ? Unless the present 
has divine meaning, What proof is there of a 
far-off divine event ? It is the recognition of 
this thought, and the absence of a vain roman- 
ticism, that gives a value to the later poem. 
For here Tennyson recognizes that if this is 
God's world, then these struggles, sins, striv- 
ings, and loves must be the expression of God's 
will : a truth which Browning repeats over and 
over again. Like various other forms of Evil, 
pessimism is not to be regarded as a final ill. 
On the contrary, " the best man is the one who 
can see the truth of pessimism, can absorb and 
transcend that truth, and can be nevertheless 
an optimist, not by virtue of his failure to 
recognize the evil of life, but by virtue of his 
readiness to take part in the struggle against 
this evil." 

One of the most interesting, as well as most 
original, of thes'e essays is " The Case of John 
Bunyan." The religious experiences of the 
great writer, as given in his remarkable Con- 
fessions, " Grace Abounding to the Chief of 
Sinners," are summarized by Professor Royce, 
and then interpreted, not in terms of the soul 
and its relation to God, but in the language of 
the latest school of empirical psychology. The 
story of Bunyan's religious life offers a rare 
object-lesson to the student of normal and ab- 
normal mental processes. Bunyan was what 
psychologists would call a good visualizer. He 
was also an expert in the dialectics of the inner 
life, and a born genius as to the whole range of 
language functions, good and bad. Describing 
his early youth, he tells us that he frequently 
felt himself tempted to curse and swear, or 
speak some grievous thing against God. These 
and other insistent morbid impulses such as 
wavering hopes, gloomy doubts and question-

ings, all of which Banyan subsumes under the 
name Tempter are more or less inhibited by 
other automatic mental processes, the result of 
a close study of the scriptures ; for a text con- 
demning or encouraging was sure to come to 
his mind whenever the oath came to his lips or 
the doubt to his consciousness. A chaos of 
motor processes was the result. Noting these 
and similar trains of morbid association, Pro- 
fessor Royce follows them through their various 
stages, as reported in the wonderfully clear 
and definite autobiography, marking the corre- 
spondence between periods of low physical con- 
dition and certain religious depressions. Finally 
the great change came, when, under a skilful 
self-imposed mental regimen, Bunyan had no 
return of the more deeply systemized disorders, 
although always a prey to elementary insistent 
temptations and depressions. The study of 
Bunyan's Case is of value as typical of morbid 
processes which have gone on in many brains 
less exalted than that of Bunyan without Buu- 
yan's power of vivid description. While Pro- 
fessor Royce has chosen to state the case in 
psychological terms, he is careful to say that 
this does not in any wise impair its worth as an 
ethical study ; for the problem to Bunyan was 
one of moral struggle, a struggle in which he 
came out victorious, recognizing in his victory 
the value of the Tempter as well as the Com- 
forter. 

The remaining essays in the volume bear 
upon other aspects of the relation of Good and 
Evil, and serve to illustrate the author's funda- 
mental theory that Evil is essential to the real- 
ization of Good ; that it is the living strife in 
the midst of which and by which God main- 
tains Himself in the world.

THE annual volume for 1898 of the " Proceedings and 
Addresses " of the National Educational Association has 
just been published under the editorship of Mr. Irwin 
Shepard, secretary of the Association, and preserves for 
the members all of the papers and discussions of the 
meeting held last July in the national capital. It is a 
thick octavo of more than eleven hundred pages, and the 
contents relate to almost every conceivable phase of the 
educational problem. An elaborate index makes these 
contents readily available for reference. We should 
add that a considerable section of the volume is devoted 
to the Chattanooga meeting, held in February, of the 
Department of Superintendence. The papers here 
printed are, of course, greatly varied in their value, and 
we cannot help wishing that the general effect were not 
quite so scrappy that the longer papers might be 
longer, and many of the shorter ones suppressed alto- 
gether. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



" Ashes of Empire " is the third in order of pub- 
lication of the series of romances in which Mr. 
Robert W. Chambers has sought to write a pictur- 
esque history of the Annie Terrible. Its predeces- 
sors are " The Red Republic " and " Lorraine." It 
will be followed by a fourth, dealing with the oper- 
ations of the Army of the Loire. We are compelled 
to say that " Ashes of Empire " is distinctly the 
poorest, as " Lorraine " is distinctly the best, of the 
three books thus far published. The author's inven- 
tion seems to be flagging, and his sentimentalism to 
have become exaggerated. Still, the gift of romantic 
story-telling is his in so marked a degree that one 
may derive a good deal of pleasure from the new 
book, which begins with the news of Sedan and the 
escape of the Empress, tells the pitiful story of the 
siege, and ends with the entry of the victorious 
Prussians into the capital. Meanwhile, we are 
made to realize by ominous mutterings the gather- 
ing of the storm soon thereafter to break in the 
Commune, of which Mr. Chambers has already 
written in " The Red Republic." Upon a previous 
occasion, in speaking of these books, we have had 
to regret the author's propensity to disfigure them 
by the introduction of caricatures of some of the 
best of Frenchmen. But the prejudices hitherto 
made manifest in the treatment of Thiers and 
Gambetta and Hugo seem feeble in comparison 
with that now excited by Renan, who is caricatured 
in the present volume so offensively that one feels 
nothing but disgust for a novelist who could so per-

vert the truth. This blot so darkens " The Ashes 
of Empire " that its real merits are likely to he 
overlooked. 

" The Road to Paris " is a long one, if we take 
the new romance by Mr. R. N. Stephens for a guide 
and cicerone. The story begins at Culloden with 
the flight into exile of the hero's father. The hero 
himself is born in the wilds of Pennsylvania, in time 
to grow up into a Revolutionary soldier, and take 
part in the fray on Bunker's Hill. He then, after 
escaping from imprisonment, joins the expedition 
to Quebec, and makes the long march through Maine 
to the St. Lawrence. In Quebec he appears as a 
spy, escapes detention, and gets carried away to 
England as a prisoner of war under the supposition 
that he is somebody else. Ethan Allen is one of 
his fellow-prisoners upon this unwilling voyage. 
Escaping from his English prison, he becomes in 
turn a strolling juggler, a gardener's assistant, and 
a fine gentleman of the town in Bath and London. 
Newgate, Vauxhall, and Hyde Park all make his 
acquaintance, and, after a surprising series of 
intrigues and adventures, he finds his way across 
the Channel in a smuggling boat, and seems at last 
to be really upon the road to Paris, the goal of his 
boyhood's ambition. But before he enters the city, 
he becomes engrossed in a sentimental episode with 
the precocious young daughter of Necker (who was 
afterwards to become the author of " Corinne"), 
and is also unwillingly mixed up in an organized 
plot for the assassination of that famous Minister. 
In consequence of all this, our hero's first entrance 
into Paris makes him a guest of the Bastille, where 
he languishes in captivity for a year or so. Escap- 
ing again (he always escapes), he makes his adven- 
turous way into Germany, and becomes a personage 
at the court of Hesse-Cassel. Here he takes part 
in a conspiracy against the Landgraf , barely escapes 
with his life, and carries off his lady-love in triumph 
to Paris, which he really enters at last in the fashion 
to be desired. The lady in the case, it should be 
added, has figured in his life both in New England 
and in Quebec, so we know she is bound to appear 
at the end and make his story all that a romance 
should be. Here, indeed, is a tangled skein of ad- 
venturous experiences, and the reader hardly knows, 
when all is over, whether to admire the more the 
author's easy and animated narrative manner, or 
the astonishing ingenuity displayed by him in mak- 
ing so many historical scenes and situations take part 
in the shaping of the hero's destiny. 

Mr. Elwyn Barron, who some years ago left 
America for an English sojourn of indefinite dura- 
tion, is now favorably recalled to the memory of 
his old circle of readers by what may fairly be 
called one of the most charming novels of the sea- 
son. " Manders " is a Europeanized production, 
almost as much so as the later stories of Mr. Henry 
Harland, which it somehow suggests, and it strik- 
ingly illustrates, when compared with Mr. Barren's 
earlier writing, the broadening influences of life in 
the great centres of European civilization. Manders 



is the name of a little boy, and he is ostensibly the 
hero of the story, but in fact he interests us less 
than his widowed mother a professional model in 
the Quarter and her vacillating but not unsym- 
pathetic lover, an American art student of ample 
means. Mr. Barren's success with his heroine is 
akin to Du Manner's success with a certain girl 
whom we need not name : it is the successful por- 
trayal of a woman who remains pure at heart amid 
surroundings that at least are not encouraging to 
purity. There is also an American heroine of pro- 
nounced and attractive type, besides the necessary 
complement of minor characters. The author has 
shown much skill in realizing these figures for us, 
besides doing it in a style that is excellent on its 
own account. He has a form of expression that is 
crisp and effective, subtly humorous upon occasion, 
but always ready to rise to the demands of a seri- 
ous situation. The book is not exactly a strong one, 
but it is exceptionally pleasing, and it rings true. 

As every reader of Mr. Stockton's books is aware, 
the stories that they tell cannot possibly be retold in 
abstract. " The Associate Hermits " is no exception 
to this rule, and an outline of its plot would give 
no notion whatever of the quaint humor, the nov- 
elty of situation, and the general whimsicality, which 
make this book a worthy companion of its many 
predecessors. About the only idea that can be de- 
tached without losing its essential flavor is the one 
with which the story opens the idea of a newly- 
wedded couple who, instead of starting on a wed- 
ding journey themselves, persuade the parents of 
the bride to do it for them. This is as Stocktonian 
a notion as can be ; to tell what follows shall be his 
affair, not ours. 

Two historical romances which stand rather above 
the usual level of merit have for their subject the 
War of 1812. Mr. George Rivers, the author of 
"The Count's Snuff-Box," has taken the episode 
of the Henry letters for a starting-point, and the 
" Count " of the title-page is the imposter who posed 
as one Edward de Grill on upon that critical occa- 
sion. Mr. Rivers supplements what is known his- 
torically of that imposter by embellishments of the 
usual romantic sort, and makes an agreeable story 
of the whole affair. The scene is laid partly on the 
shore of Buzzard's Bay and partly in Washington, 
the burning of the capital by a horde of British ruf- 
fians affording a thrilling climax to the work. 

The burning of Washington also appears in " A 
Herald of the West," by Mr. Joseph Altsheler, but 
midway in this case, for the Battle of New Orleans 
provides the climax. Mr. Altsheler's book is more 
closely historical than the one before mentioned, 
and those who have read his two earlier romances of 
American history do not need to be told that he is a 
writer of real power. In these days, which are 
witnessing a recementation of the ties that should 
and must bind together the English-speaking peo- 
ples, we are apt to forget how real were the griev- 
ances that brought on the War of 1812. These the 
author recalls to us in plain terms, with perhaps just

a touch of the bitterness that should by this time 
have disappeared altogether, but certainly with no 
harboring of the old rancor. The story is well-knit, 
varied of interest, thrilling upon occasion, and dis- 
tinctly to be praised. 

" Exiled for Lese Majeste' " is a taking title for 
a book, and when a glance at the pages shows it to 
be a story of. Russian despotism and imprisonment 
in Siberia, a certain pleasurable anticipation is 
aroused. Bat the expectation is doomed to disap- 
pointment upon further examination, for the story 
proves but a tenuous thread upon which the author 
hangs a heavy burden of miscellaneous information 
concerning all subjects under the sun (and others). 
Interminable conversations of a semi-didactic sort 
are the substance of the book, while the romantic 
interest is lost like a rivulet in the desert. We can- 
not help being amused at the audacity of the writer 
in making his characters discuss (in the time of 
Nicholas that is, in the early fifties ) such subjects 
as Darwinism and the marvellous growth of Chicago, 
and quote from FitzGerald's Omar and the later 
poems of Longfellow. No such trifling matter as 
an anachronism is going to stand in the way of this 
writer's fancy ; if he wishes to point a moral, he is 
evidently not to be deterred by any consideration 
of what the mere facts will justify. 

" With Bought Swords " is a Spanish-American 
romance of revolution and intrigue, in which the 
author has by no means ma'de the most of his mate- 
rials. The effect is too sketchy to be in any way 
impressive. Over and over again, situations that 
might have been worked up excitingly are merely 
hinted at, and one follows the story with some dif- 
ficulty. We fear that this book must be character- 
ized as a bit of amateurish effort undeserving of 
serious attention. 

Those who expected the new novel by " Maarten 
Maartens " to be a work of such elaborate interest 
as " My Lady Nobody " or " God's Fool " will be 
disappointed. It is so long since the author last 
came before the public that such an expectation was 
reasonable, but instead of fulfilling it, he now pre- 
sents us with what is little more than a sketch. The 
book is called " Her Memory," and is the study of 
a man's sorrow when bereft of a beloved wife, and 
left to face an existence made solitary save by the 
presence of the little girl who is left him. How the 
passionate soul of the man rebels, and how the first 
poignancy of grief gradually becomes tempered into 
endurance, how the lives of both father and child 
develope under the influence of the tender memory 
that remains to them, and how existence in the end 
comes once more to take on its wonted aspect ; all 
these things are imparted to our sympathies rather 
than to our intellect by the writer's graceful art. 
Few novelists have so marked a temperament as this 
Anglicized Dutchman of genius, and the tempera- 
ment is such as to suggest Thackeray in more than 
one way, although there is back of it no such wealth 
of intellectual resource as was possessed by the 
author of " Vanity Fair " and " Henry Esmond." 



" Her Memory " is a welcome visitor to our table, but 
we cannot help wishing that it were ampler in dimen- 
sions and richer in content. 

" In any case this tale has no claim to be called 
a historical novel," says Mr. Gilbert Parker in a 
note appended to " The Battle of the Strong." We 
shall take the liberty of qualifying this assertion to 
a certain extent. Admitting the fact that the char- 
acters concerned are wholly the creations of the 
author, it must yet be said that a novel may be 
historical even if no actor on the stage of actual 
history treads its boards. The setting must be taken 
into account, the manners and customs depicted, 
the truthfulness to the larger historical facts of the 
period and the place concerned. In these particu- 
lars, the book is a historical novel in a high and fine 
sense, just as Victor Hugo's " Les Mise'rables " is a 
historical novel, and would remain one without its 
description of the battle of Waterloo. There are 
more reasons than one for the suggestion, in the 
present connection, of the great French masterpiece. 
It is made inevitable by the fact that Mr. Parker's 
book is a romance of Jersey, for no one may write 
of the Channel Islands without suggesting the writer 
who lived among them during nearly twenty years' 
voluntary exile. There are, furthermore, among 
Mr. Parker's pages not a few which in manner, in 
epic breadth of treatment, and in poetic envisage- 
ment of an impressive scene or situation, constantly 
recall to the mind this or that page of " Quatre-Vingt- 
Treize " and " Les Travailleurs de la Mer." Nor is 
the comparison an unworthy one, for Mr. Parker 
here approves himself to be of the great race of story- 
tellers, and has produced a work that must be reck- 
oned among the masterpieces of recent fiction. The 
scene is Jersey, for the most part, although an im- 
portant section of the romance takes us to the Duchy 
of Bercy, and the time that of the Revolution. The 
island itself remains almost undisturbed during these 
stormy years, but echoes from Paris, and La Vende'e, 
and the high seas where English and French are 
pitted against each other, reach the scene from 
time to time, and bring the action into relief against 
an impressive historical background. Still, its inter- 
est, which runs the entire gamut from the lightest 
comedy to the deepest tragedy, is essentially domes- 
tic, and concerns the lives of a few Jerseymen and 
Jerseywomen. Among these the heroine, Guida 
de Landresse, shines like a star in the purity of her 
womanhood, and about her are grouped three men 
who love her one less than his ambition, another 
with a too dumb and dog-like devotion, a third, to 
whose life her gracious presence gives renewed no- 
bility of purpose, and who wins her in the end, after 
she has sounded all the depths of grief, and felt to 
the full the chastening influence of suffering. The 
story is one in which strength and sweetness are so 
subtly commingled that each intensifies the other. 
Mr. Parker has made judicious use of a vast amount 
of material collected for his work. The history, 
the customs, the dialect, the folk-lore, and the insti- 
tutions of the island are drawn upon most effectively.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



and when the climax is reached, it is an ancient 
legal formula that provides the keynote to an 
intensely dramatic situation. When the wronged 
Guida appeals for justice to the Cour d'He*ritage, it 
is with the old Norman cry : Haro, haro ! a Paide, 
mon Prince, on me fait tort ! The effect, as con- 
trived by Mr. Parker, is simply overwhelmning. 
We might go on almost indefinitely in praising this 
book which is an advance upon even " The Seats 
of the Mighty " but enough has been said to make 
it clear that here is a work to be reckoned with, and 
to persuade our readers of the pleasure that is in 
store for them. 

Sir Walter Besant has written so many novels 
that some of them must be poorer than the others, 
and there is no doubt that " The Changeling " is 
one of the least successful of them all. It is more 
discursive than usual, more obviously artificial, and 
has more resort to situations and coincidences of the 
kind that strain the credulity. It tells of a mother 
who, losing her infant child, seeks to spare its father 
the grief of the loss by putting another child in the 
vacant place. How this sin finds her out after many 
years, and how the history of the substituted child 
proves heredity to be stronger than environment, 
are the two main themes of this story, which is 
rather bewildering in its complications, and unim- 
pressive in its outcome. 

A few months ago, we noticed an extraordinary 
romance entitled " The Lake of Wine," by Mr. 
Bernard Capes. It will possibly be remembered 
that this title was derived from the fanciful name 
of a great ruby, for the discovery and possession of 
which many men ventured (and some of them lost) 
their lives. In reading " The Adventurers," by Mr. 
Marriott Watson, we find the same story, in its gen- 
eral outline, retold. The treasure in this case is gold 
and not jewels, but otherwise the similarity is strik- 
ing. There is an ancient country house in England, 
and the treasure which it conceals is eagerly con- 
tended for by the owner of the house and the des- 
perate gang of cutthroats who have learned of its 
existence. In both cases, also, the hiding-place of 
the treasure is as unknown to the one party as to 
the other. The chief difference is in the style of 
the two narratives, for that of " The Adventurers " 
is as plain and straightforward as that of " The Lake 
of Wine " is affected and tortuous. It is a rather 
daring thing, for either writer, thus to have framed 
in the setting of the nineteenth century conditions 
in a civilized country an action so full of lawlessness 
and bloody violence that it belongs rather to Turkey 
or to the sixteenth century. The story is certainly 
interesting, and its plot is most ingeniously contrived. 

In " The Red Axe," Mr. Crockett departs from 
his wonted scenes and his well-worn Scots, to write 
of the robber barons of mediaeval Germany. For 
once, he has for us no moss-hags and no stern Cov- 
enanters, but instead, Gothic towers and ruthless 
bands of the rough riders of several centuries ago. 
The book is very " bluggy." The hero is the son 
of the hereditary justiciar to the Dukes of the Wolf- 



mark, and is himself called upon, in the due course 
of events, to take up the axe of the executioner. 
Thrills occur upon nearly every page of this story, 
which is so swift in its action that one gasps for 
breath in trying to keep up with it. There is a love- 
story, too, as tender as any that the author has 
imagined, and, altogether, the book affords much 
exciting entertainment. .'' .f 

" Grace O'Malley, Princess and Pirate " is surely 
a fetching title, and the covers of the book add pic- 
torial effect to verbal by a poster-portrait of the 
heroine. The story turns out to be a wild history 
of love and revenge in Elizabethan Ireland, with 
the historical figure of the Earl of Desmond set 
among those drawn by the writer from his imagina- 
tion. The story is related in the first person, and 
with the usual affectation of an archaic form of 
speech. But, despite the author's endeavor, his 
book is a rather dull one, and he misses the romantic 
touch of which such men as Mr. Bloundelle-Burton, 
for instance, know the secret so well. 

The " Adventures of the Comte de la Muette dur- 
ing the Reign of Terror " is an interesting romance 
of a rather conventional sort, which tells how an 
aristocrat, by means of disguise, escaped massacre, 
and how he also saved the life of a fair aristocratic 
damsel, who naturally became his wife when their 
adventures were over. It is a picturesque and 
thrilling narrative, with the proper infusion of sen- 
timent, studied from the memoirs of the period, and 
told with considerable dramatic effect. 

Mr. Bloundelle-Burton is rapidly taking the place, 
if he has not already taken it, that clearly belongs 
to him among writers of historical romance. Few, 
if any, of his living fellow-workers in this field have 
a finer sense of the requirements of this form of 
fiction, or a better equipment for its production. In 
" The Scourge of God," he has taken for his theme 
the Huguenot persecutions that followed the Revo- 
cation. The scene is laid among the CeVennes, and 
the desolation wrought in that fair region by the 
Most Christian King's endeavor to stamp out a 
pestilent heresy is pictured with vivid and terrible 
effect. The monarch who was so justly called the 
" Scourge of God " does not appear personally in 
these pages, and the "femme funeste et terrible" 
at whose behest he acted appears only in two brief 
scenes ; but, in a certain sense, these two personages 
dominate the history, and their figures ever loom 
up in the background of the imagination. The story 
is one of the best in style, construction, information, 
and graphic power, that have been written in recent 
years. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



A " History of the World from the Earliest Histor- 
ical Time to the Year 1898," is the title of a volume 
prepared by Mr. Edgar Sanderson for " The Concise 
Knowledge Library " (Appleton). One rather gasps at 
the thought of such a book, but series have to exist, and 
volumes must be made to fit them. Mr. Sanderson is 
a careful historical scholar, and his book commands 
approval.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

New England There are some things that would 
letters and lead one to keep separate in the 

New England life. mind Mr> W> C> Lawton's " New 

England Poets " (Macmillan) and Mrs. Harriet H. 
Robinson's "Loom and Spindle" (Crowell). The 
latter book will be of value to the economist and 
the historian : Mr. Carroll D. Wright, who contri- 
butes an Introduction, adds his authority on this 
point. The former, as will be inferred by the read- 
ers of Mr. Lawton's recent book on Homer, will be 
useful mainly to the literary student. But the two 
books came to us at the same time, and they con- 
nect themselves in our mind. Mr. Lawton's book 
is a good statement of the position and the work of 
Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, 
and Holmes. Mrs. Robinson's is a very interest- 
ing account of the life and characteristics of the 
Lowell mill-girls half a century ago. Mr. Lawton, 
as one may see from his title, emphasizes the idea 
that these poets were New England poets : that 
their lives and work was conditioned by their being 
born and living in New England. Now, New En- 
gland in the middle of this century was certainly not 
all factory-life in Lowell, and yet the change is not 
very severe from Lucy Larcom's " New England 
Girlhood " to Dr. Edward Everett Kale's " New 
England Boyhood." It is not that Emerson and 
Holmes, for instance, were of the stock of which 
mill-hands were made. But the old families from 
which they sprang never held themselves very far 
above the old families from which the mill-girls 
came, and in very many forms of thought and modes 
of feeling they never separated themselves at all. 
Everywhere the same church, the same school, the 
same town-meeting served for both, and much the 
same careers were open to both. The Brahmin 
caste was really not a caste, properly speaking, at 
all, for it never shunned communion with others. 
Of course these poets were of the picked New En- 
gland stock, picked over in some cases for genera- 
tions. That is true ; but who picked them, and for 
whom were they picked ? Who was it that was to 
understand them, who did understand them, if it 
comes to that ? Not more the mill-girls of Lowell 
than the students of Harvard, doubtless ; but who 
were they ? The old Lowell factory-life is especially 
interesting because particular circumstances gave 
the opportunity for presenting in great purity the 
type of New England, the worker, the worshipper, 
the lover of the things of the mind. This is seen 
in Mrs. Robinson's book, which is of these two the 
more interesting, for it deals with matters which 
are to the most of us half familiar ; it opens a door 
into the past, as Lowell says, into a room that we 
have heard of but never entered ; it tells us of a 
life eminently characteristic and now wholly passed 
away. But its interest, to us at least, is greatly 
heightened by the fact that it enables us to read 
the other book so much more understandingly. We 
rather wish that Mr. Lawton had been able to read 



it before writing his own book. It makes one under- 
stand, better than before, all the six that he writes 
of except Hawthorne, and perhaps even Hawthorne. 
They are rightly called " New England " poets. 
But what is, or rather was, New England? That 
is something which we need not try to say just here. 
There are a hundred books to answer those that 
cannot remember, but the list will not be complete 
until it includes Mrs. Robinson's simple record of 
a phase long gone forever. 

France as France to-day, convulsed by the 

elucidated by Dreyf us matter, presents a curious, 
the Dreyfus case. a humiliating, yet a not altogether 
hopeless spectacle of national retrogression : curious 
to the social pathologist, humiliating to the opti- 
mistic champion of free institutions, not altogether, 
or indeed by any means, hopeless to those who 
understand the transient and superficial character 
of these periodic outbreaks of French, or per- 
haps more accurately speaking, Parisian hysteria. 
Broadly speaking, the Dreyfus case and the popular 
hallucinations attending it are the result of the 
momentary ascendency of forces which the Revolu- 
tion overthrew but unhappily could not extirpate. 
There were diseased parts in the national body 
which the rude and sometimes misapplied surgery 
of the soi-disant regenerators of France failed to 
cut away, and which could not have been quite cut 
away by far more skilful operators. Now a portion 
of the poisonous virus has worked its way to the 
surface ; and the civilized world looks on in amaze- 
ment at the spectacle of Jesuitry, bigotry, caste- 
tyranny, working their infamous will on an innocent 
man, quite as in the days of Galas and La Barre ; 
while a populace that a decade ago celebrated the 
centenary of the fall of the Bastille stands by ap- 
plauding and supporting the outrage. Unhappily, 
there is now no Voltaire to smite the evil. But the 
mind of France is saner and her conscience more 
sensitive than in the days when the "intellectuals " 
of Voltaire's century fought the battle against the 
foes of right and reason that M. Zola and his col- 
leagues are fighting to-day ; and there is good ground 
of hope that Frenchmen are even now shaking off 
the degrading hallucination that condemns the un- 
happy Dreyfus and the heroic Picquart to shame 
and torture, while the reptilian Esterhazy and the 
monstrous Drumont go unwhipt of justice. If there 
be to-day any rational being, outside of France, who 
is still unconvinced of the fact that Esterhazy is the 
man who ought to be where Dreyfus is, that he is 
the writer of the bordereau and the seller to the 
German attache of the military secrets therein listed, 
we earnestly commend to him Mr. F. C. Conybeare's 
concise and conclusive little book entitled "The 
Dreyfus Case" (Dodd). Through the presentation 
of documents, facsimiles of handwriting, etc., and 
through its well-marshalled history of the successive 
stages and phases of the case, it puts beyond the 
shadow of a doubt the facts of the innocence of 
Dreyfus and the guilt of Esterhazy. The volume

addresses by are the " University Addresses " de- 

Prindpai Caird. ii vere( j before the students of the 
University of Glasgow by the late Principal John 
Caird, and now reprinted by the Macmillan Co. in 
a neat volume of 380 odd pages, under the editorial 
supervision of Professor Edward Caird of Balliol 
College, Oxford. The addresses here collected are 
of two kinds : those customarily delivered by Prin- 
cipal Caird at the beginning of each session, on 
some subject connected with the studies of the Uni- 
versity, or on the life and work of some great author 
with whose name one or other of these studies is 
representatively connected ; and those addresses on 
some general topic of University Education which 
Principal Caird was in the habit of delivering to 
the graduates at the end of the session, after the 
graduation ceremonies. Of the former and more 
important class of addresses, the volume contains 
twelve. Of the graduation addresses, only two are 
given : " The Personal Element in Teaching," and 
" General and Professional Education." Principal 
Caird, in one notable passage, pays a tribute to the 
universities of Scotland that may be quoted here as 
suggesting a useful ideal not, we think, kept so fully 
in view as it should be in the great educational 
foundations of our own country : " It is the glory of 
our Scottish universities that they have never been 
made places of education for a class, that no costly 
arrangements render access to them possible only for 
the rich, and that when once he has crossed their doors 
a young man finds himself in a community where 
intellectual resource is the only wealth that wins re- 
spect, brain power the only power that tells, and 
where honor and distinction await the ablest and 
worthiest, and await these alone." This special tribute 
which Principal Caird felt in conscience justified in 
paying to the universities of his own country applies, 
we think, with equal justice to those of Germany 
and France. That any superiorities other than 
those of mind and character should, in an institution 
of learning, be the marks of its acknowledged aris- 
tocracy, seems anomalous enough ; but we fear the 
anomaly is not unknown in republican America. 
Educators especially should find these sane and 
earnest addresses useful and stimulating.

justify the lavish encomiums heaped upon it by the

why the ordinary newspaper should laud Mr. Stee-

of " hot stuff " that the ordinary newspaper has been

posed sending to the front, and say to them : " This

in fine, is a clever and well-spiced piece of war-time 
reporting, made in a hurry on the spot and meant 
for immediate home consumption : but it is nothing 
more than that. Its vogue with the British public 
is easily explained. The Sirdar is just now the 
British public's especial hero, and Mr. Steevens tells 
what he did and lauds him without stint or reserva- 
tion for doing it ; the British public, too, is for the 
first time in a quarter of a century or more unques- 
tionably in a fighting mood, and Mr. Steevens's 
battle-pictures give it much the same sort of grati- 
fication that our own public gets from " kineto- 
scope " views of the more crucial and historic pugi- 
listic events. Reading Mr. Steevens's cheery and 
often even jocular account of the Sudan campaign 
is almost as good (or as bad) as seeing the thing 
itself. Mr. Steevens has the knack of describing 
things vividly, and we do n't mean to carp at him 
for giving his employers and the public their money's 
worth of gore and grewsomeness. But he might, it 
would seem, without loss of cash or credit, have 
written less flippantly, and with a more apparent 
sense of the fact that this tragic, if perhaps una- 
voidable, Sudan business this scientific butchery 
of a half-armed mob of half-savage religionists 
is a dark and deplorable episode in the history of 
the territorial conquests of Western civilization. 
Mr. Steevens, we are glad to note, appears to recog- 
nize the fact that, when the day of Omdurman was 
done, the palm of valor lay, not (broadly speaking) 
with the men who had been behind, but with those 
who had been before, the guns. The volume is 
supplied with maps and plans, and serves to convey 
a tolerably good idea of General Kitchener's meth- 
ods of dealing with the problem his predecessors 
had so egregiously failed to solve. 

Probably there is but one religious

tory, adequately told, would require 
more than a duodecimo volume of three or four 
hundred pages. That one is the Parish of Trinity 
Church, New York City. It is a notable parish in 
many respects. Its annals are closely connected 
with those of the city in which it exists. The du- 
ties and responsibilities of its rector are greater than 
those of some of the bishops. It celebrated its 
bicentennial in 1897, and the elegant volume set- 
ting forth the proceedings in the nine churches com- 
prised in this immense city parish seems to have 
whetted the appetite of the parishioners for more 
history. So records running back to the early years 
of the seventeenth century have been ransacked, 
and the Rev. Dr. Dix, Rector, has begun the prepa-

ration of a complete history of the parish. The 
result thus far is a royal octavo volume of over 
500 pages, bringing the narrative down to 1783, 
that is to say, down to the close of the Revolutionary 
War and the opening of the history of the parish 
under new ecclesiastical relations. All this is given 
with the promise of an indefinite number of volumes 
in the future to bring the history down to the pres- 
ent time. The history is considerably more than a 
transcript of musty records. It contains some val- 
uable contributions to general history. The author 
(who, because the task of research was necessarily 
committed to others, modestly claims to be merely 
an editor) is not a thresher of old straw. He pur- 
sues an independent course, corrects some errors 
which have crept into general history, notably con- 
cerning the character of Governor Fletcher and that 
of Leisler ; and even corrects errors into which he 
confesses himself to have been drawn in previous 
historical writings. The volume is handsomely 
printed, and illustrated with full-page portraits and 
facsimiles of documents. The publishers (G. P. 
Putnam's Sons) announce that 750 copies of this 
edition have been printed for sale. 

A volume on " The Rivers of North 
America " (Putnam) is offered mod- 
estly by its author, Professor Israel 
C. Russell of the University of Michigan, as a " read- 
ing lesson for students " of physiography or geology. 
It proves to be a well-digested thesis upon the effects 
of rivers in fashioning the surfaces of the regions 
where they are generated or through which they 
flow. Each drop of aerial water does its work, 
infinitesimal though it may be. With its fellows, it 
takes certain substances into solution ; others it 
holds in suspension ; manifold more it pushes along, 
as, in obedience to gravity, it pursues its devious 
way toward a distant sea, ever wearing the chan- 
nels through which it flows. Even if, sooner or 
later, it should be lifted again by evaporation, it 
will have contributed something, if it be only to lay 
down in another place the atom which its solvent 
power seized elsewhere. In time, such drops will 
have carved the mountains, filled and seamed the 
valleys, eroded the canons, and transformed all the 
contours of the earth's surface ; in time, no coun- 
teracting upheaval occurring, they will have re- 
moved all elevations, and restored old ocean's vast 
and solitary reign. Professor Russell's logical and 
lucid treatment of his subject makes his " reader " 
attractive for both scientist and layman. Another 
volume from the same publishers, "Earth Sculp- 
ture," by Professor James Geikie of the University 
of Edinburgh, describes the configuration of the 
earth's surface as the resultant of every variety of 
physical activity, whether working internally or 
externally. The work includes the results of the 
latest geological surveys, notably those within the 
western half of the United States. The author has 
addressed the great body of intelligent readers not 
professionally versed in geology. 



Scrap-book M.rs. Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer's 

of the French, " Scrap-Book of the French Revolu- 
Revoiuiion. tion ( Mc ci U rg) is made up of ma- 

terial gotten together by the author in the course of 
her work as a lecturer on the French Revolution. 
The book is frankly a compilation, and as such it 
has the distinctive merit that its contents are to a 
considerable extent drawn from unfamiliar and 
comparatively inaccessible sources. Of especial 
interest are the excerpts from the series of mono- 
graphs on the events of the Revolution published 
in the Paris " Figaro " during the years 1893, 
1894, and 1895. The volume opens with some 
rather interesting reminiscences of an American, 
Thomas Waters Griffith, who resided in Paris from 
1791 to 1799, and was an eye-witness of many dra- 
matic Revolutionary episodes. He saw, for instance, 
both Louis XVI. and his unhappy consort passing 
through the streets on their way to the scaffold 
the former in " court-like dress " in " a handsome 
coach," the latter in " a common cart " like an or- 
dinary malefactor, and attracting comparatively 
little attention from the populace. It is greatly to 
be regretted that Mr. Griffith was not a keener ob- 
server, or, at least, that he did not more fully realize 
the great historical and dramatic interest of the 
remarkable scenes he skims over so carelessly in 
his too cursory narrative. Mrs. Latimer's book 
contains a good deal of curious, suggestive reading, 
and deserves its popularity. There are twenty-nine 
portraits in half-tone, including an interesting one 
of the Rev. Eleazer Williams, the alleged "lost 
Dauphin," whose singular story is given in the 
closing chapters on " Louis XVII." 

Mr. A. G. Newcomer is one of those 
professors of rhetoric who believe 
that a writer should consider first 
what he would say, and only when that is settled 
should he consider what particular words to use. 
This obvious view is not common among our writers 
on rhetoric, although Mr. Newcomer's " Elements 
of Rhetoric " (Holt) is by no means the only book 
in recent years which has been based upon it. The 
older writers Professor Bain, for instance, or 
Professor A. S. Hill prefer to begin with a study 
of words. The latter especially did great things in 
the cause of diction. Their influence has been such 
that most people (even in college faculties) think 
that there is no rhetorical fault worse than misspell- 
ing or bad grammar : such, at least, are the only 
faults ever mentioned. The newer practise is really 
not new : it has the authority of every rhetorician 
who ever put pen to paper, from the days of Korax 
and Tisias down to the time that Dr. George Camp- 
bell, with his speculations on Good Usage, knocked 
the classical rhetoric into a cocked-up hat, so far as 
authority was concerned. We do not mean that 
Mr. Newcomer is a neo-Aristotelian, or any other 
such creature : his earlier book, which had some- 
thing to do in bringing about the change of heart 
that is gradually taking place, was a very simple

talk to schoolboys and schoolgirls as to what they 
could write about best. It said nothing about Aris- 
totle : but then, it had nothing of Campbell either. 
The present work, founded on the right theory, and 
the result of individual work of some years on the 
right lines, has a great deal in it that is direct and 
practical. We are glad to see it, and hope we may 
help it a bit toward a wide circulation. 

It has been long years since a thor- 
i? oughly up-to-date one-volume Bible 

Dictionary made its appearance. The 
numerous discoveries of recent years in Bible lands 
and adjacent lands, the new investigations in Bib- 
lical archaeology and in Biblical criticism, have de- 
manded a re-writing of nearly every article in the 
Bible Dictionaries of a quarter of a century ago. 
Professor John D. Davis of Princeton Theological 
Seminary, with the cooperation of two of his col- 
leagues, Drs. Warfield and Purves, and after three 
years of incessant labor, has produced the book that 
is needed (Westminster Press, Philadelphia). It is 
a volume of 800 pages, covering the whole range of 
Biblical themes, and of the First Book of Maccabees. 
It aims to confine itself to facts, and to facts of the 
Scriptures and of records and things which throw 
light on the Bible. It very wisely leaves out spec- 
ulation about the Bible, which is usually short-lived 
and always of uncertain value. It is amply, almost 
profusely, illustrated with pictures, not of the imag- 
ination, but of the actual things themselves. Several 
up-to-date maps, based on the most recent discov- 
eries and authorities, were prepared especially for 
this work. The articles are well-proportioned in 
length and fulness of treatment. Their position is 
that, not of a hide-bound conservative, but of a pro- 
gressive and safe leader in the interpretation of the 
facts of the Bible. The up-to-date character, the 
fulness of illustration, the wealth of maps, the pro- 
gressive position, and the cheapness of the volume 
ought to make this the one-volume Dictionary of the 
Bible for many years to come. 

In The Wonderful Century " 
theMrl (Dodd), Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace 

discusses in two aspects the scientific 
achievements of the century now closing. In one 
group he enumerates the theoretical discoveries 
with the practical invention resting thereupon. His 
list includes twelve examples of the first such as 
the conservation of energy, organic evolution, the 
ground theories of chemistry ; and twelve of the 
second as railways, telegraphs, photography, and 
the use of anaesthetics and antiseptics. With this 
list he compares all the discoveries of preceding 
ages, of which he names fifteen as gravitation 
and the circulation of the blood, the art of printing, 
the mariner's compass, and the telescope. In a con- 
trasted group of what he calls the failures of the 
century, the author enumerates subjects as to which 
he insists that the scientific world has fallen into 
lamentable errors, either by underrating or by

wholly ignoring their real significance and value, as 
in the neglect of phrenology and the opposition to 
hypnotism and psychical research; or by over- 
valuing what he holds to be delusive and mischiev- 
ous, as vaccination and militarism, which latter he 
calls the curse of civilization. The book has an 
interest as illustrating the excursions of a distin- 
guished naturalist into fields outside of his specialty. 
The first part of it almost any well-informed scien- 
tist might have written ; the second part scarcely 
any such person would have written. 

We are glad to have an English 
translation, and one which has been 
made with unusual skill, of M. 
Ferdinand Brunetiere's " Manual of the History of 
French Literature" (Crowell). The work is so 
masterly an example of such a history, so solid in 
its scholarship and so attractive in its setting-forth, 
that it is valuable both on its own account and as a 
model of how such a thing ought to be done. The 
plan is rather original. The text is a philosophical 
essay in the author's familiar manner, while the 
erudition is relegated to the footnotes which occupy 
about half of each page. The author calls his work 
" an application of the doctrine of Evolution to the 
history of a great literature." The translation 
bears the assumed name of " Ralph Derechef." 
Sixteen portraits illustrate the volume. We are 
glad also to welcome in this connection the volume 
of " Brunetiere's Essays in French Literature," 
selected and translated by Mr. D. Nichol Smith, 
and imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 
The volume includes seven of the author's most 
characteristic essays, and a special preface written 
by him for this translation. 

Sir Edward W. Hamilton's thought- 
ful and commendably temperate 
of Gladstone. monograph on Gladstone (Scribner ) 
has the prima facie recommendation of being from 
the pen of a man who knew the great statesman 
well for nearly forty years, and was closely asso- 
ciated with him during a considerable portion of 
that period. Sir Edward aims to convey to his 
readers a just notion of Mr. Gladstone the man, 
through describing some of his intellectual powers, 
characteristics, and accomplishments, some of his 
ways, aims, and objects, his likes and dislikes, and 
his general turn of mind. The little book is well 
worth reading, and while it cannot be said to throw 
any special new light on Mr. Gladstone's singularly 
complex character, its observations are in general 
just, well-weighed, and discriminating. 

It would have been singularly im- 
P r P er to have had a Famous 
Scots " series without a life of Sir 
William Wallace : scarcely a Scot is more famous. 
Yet it was no easy task to write that life. Too 
little is known of Wallace, for one thing ; and for 
another, too little is known by the general reader of 
the history and general life of Scotland at the be-

ginning of the fourteenth century. At any rate, one 
gets but a hazy notion of the hero or of his oppor- 
tunity, in the volume by Professor Murison (im- 
ported by Scribner). The chief figure is shadowy; 
the circumstances are like those of a dream. The 
result may be imagined : killings and burnings, 
victories and defeats, plottings and betrayals, we 
get a confused vision of such matters, but no clear 
understanding. This volume is hardly as interest- 
ing as most of the series, a matter not entirely 
chargeable to the author. It gives us something of 
an account of a simple and violent career in a troub- 
lous and complicated time. We think most readers 
will know more of Wallace after they have read it 
than before ; but further it would be rather hard to 
go in the way of praise. 



Court of 
the Second 
Empire. 



M. de Saint-Amand's "The Court 
of the Second Empire, 1856-1858 " 
(Scribner) is a rather exceptionally 
animated and interesting number of the sub-series 
of this brilliant writer's popular historical studies 
now current. The three years bridging the time 
from the Crimean War to the Italian war of 1859 
form the epoch covered in this book. The salient 
episodes treated are the coronation of the Czar 
Alexander II., the Orsini attempt, and the diplo- 
matic preludes to the war which led immediately to 
the liberation from Austrian rule of northern Italy. 
Separate chapters are devoted to Walewski, De 
Morny, and Cavour. There are four portraits. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"The More Excellent Way" (Oxford University 
Press) is a volume of brief selections in verse and prose, 
all relating to the "Life of Love," compiled by the 
Hon. Mrs. Lyttelton Gell. The very wide range of au- 
thors represented would seem to bear out the statement 
that " a poet without love were a physical and moral 
impossibility." The selections are admirably classified 
under appropriate readings, and have been chosen with 
great art and taste. Less, however, is to be said for 
the taste of the publishers. The combination of dark 
blue cover with pale-green edges makes a homely exte- 
rior; the same combination within, used for type and 
decorative designs, makes a striking but not beautiful 
printed page. 

Mr. W. E. H. Lecky's " Democracy and Liberty " 
(Longmans) has just passed into a second edition, and 
the author avails himself of the opportunity thus pre- 
sented to discuss, in a special introduction of some fifty 
pages, " the experience of the last eventful years." In 
the light of this experience, the outlook seems even 
gloomier than it did before, and the new introduction, 
to say nothing of the book itself, is far from cheerful 
reading. But the problems which it raises are to be 
solved only by facing them bravely and squarely; and 
no writer of our time brings to their discussion a more 
penetrative insight or a riper wisdom. 

Judging from the example we have seen, the novel 
" Color Prints " of Miss Pamela Colman Smith should 
meet with considerable favor. The term " print " as 



applied to these pictures seems to us ill-advised and 
misleading, as it naturally suggests the use of litho- 
graphy or some other method of mechanical reproduc- 
tion. In reality, the outline only of the picture is. 
printed, this being then filled in by hand in water-color 
and retouched by the artist. The colors are chosen with 
taste, and are carefully applied, and the effect of the 
finished work is both artistic and pleasing. Five sub- 
jects have been issued, varying in price from two ta 
five dollars each, remarkably cheap, when the amount 
of work involved is considered. The prints are pub- 
lished by Mr. R. H. Russell. 

Mr. Austin Dobson's fondness for the eighteenth cen- 
tury is shown once more in his volume of " Miscellanies n 
(Dodd). Nearly all of its thirteen papers concern them- 
selves with books or authors of that period as Gold- 
smith, Steele, Dr. Johnson, Gay ; others have to do with 
London of that date or earlier. " Old Whitehall," with 
a reduced ground-plan of the Royal Palace as it was in 
the year 1680, and " Changes in Charing Cross," looking 
back to the time of Queen Elizabeth, are chapters to 
delight the antiquary; for of Dobson, as of his favorite 
Goldsmith, it may be said, " He touches nothing that he 
does not adorn. 

A fifth edition of the late Professor Martin's " briefer 
course " in " The Human Body," revised by Dr. George 
Wells Fitz, has just been published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. The work still has the perfunctory chapter 
on narcotics, without which it could not be used in the 
schools of a number of States, but Dr. Fitz takes pains 
to state that this chapter " is retained against the best 
judgment of the reviser, who believes that the questions 
involved are ethical and not physiological." The book 
is, of course, aside from this defect, one of the best 
elementary manuals of human anatomy and physiology 
that have ever been written. In another text-book of 
the same subject, written by Dr. E. Franklin Smith, 
and published by Mr. William R. Jenkins, the chapter on 
narcotics volunteers the delightful statement that " tee- 
total drinks " contain from six to fourteen per cent of 
alcohol, coming somewhere between claret and cham- 
pagne in the list. 

" Where to Educate," published by Messrs. Brown & 
Co., Boston, is described as " a guid to the best private 
schools, higher institutions of learning, etc., in the United 
States." It is a volume of nearly four hundred pages, 
and is edited by Miss Grace Powers Thomas. She sup- 
plies a good deal of information that may give the book 
value for reference, but she has not always been on her 
guard. Among the Illinois institutions which are 
included we find, to our amazement, one of the chief 
offenders in the matter of fraudulent degrees, the estab- 
lishment which more than any other has led to the pro- 
posed legislation which we discuss in the editorial pages 
of this issue. 

Miscellaneous reading-books for the young are of all 
sorts nowadays. Among the more recent of them we 
mention " Uncle Robert's Geography " (Appleton), ed- 
ited by Mr. F. W. Parker and Miss Nellie L. Helm;. 
" Our Country's Flag and the Flags of Foreign Coun- 
tries " (Appleton), by Dr. Edward S. Holden; " Poetry 
of the Seasons " (Silver), compiled by Miss Mary I. 
Lovejoy; "Historic Boston and Its Neighborhood" 
(Appleton), by Dr. Edward Everett Hale; "Heroes of 
the Middle West" (Ginn), by Mrs. Mary Hartwell 
Catherwood ; and " First Steps in the History of Our 
Country " (Silver), by Messrs. W. A. Mowry and A. M. 
Mowry.

Paul et Virginia," edited by Professor Oscar Kuhns, 
is one of the latest of the French texts published by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

A teacher's manual of "United States History in 
Elementary Schools," by Mrs. L. L. W. Wilson, is 
published by the Macmillan Co. 

" Plane and Solid Germany," by Dr. James Howard 
Gore, is an elementary text-book, just published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" The Attic Theatre," by Mr. A. E. Haigh, has passed 
into a second and considerably enlarged edition, which 
comes to us from Mr. Henry Frowde of the Oxford 
Clarendon Press. 

A " Critique of Some Recent Subjunctive Theories," 
by Mr. Charles Edwin Bennett, forms No. IX. of the 
" Cornell Studies in Classical Philology," published by 
the Macmillan Co. 

" A Complete Latin Grammar," by Professor Albert 
Harkness, is the final product of many revisions and 
much teaching experience. The American Book Co. 
are the publishers. 

"The Rig- Veda Mantras in the Grhya Sutras" is 
a doctor's dissertation prepared for the Johns Hopkins 
University by Mr. Edwin W. Fay, and published at 
Roanoke, Virginia. 

As a valentine to their friends, the " Brothers of the 
Book" have issued a beautifully-printed leaflet con- 
taining Mrs. Rosamund Marriott- Watson's poem, " Old 
Books, Fresh Flowers." 

"The Principles of Agriculture" (Macmillan), by 
Mr. L. H. Bailey, is a " text-book for schools and rural 
societies," written from the widest knowledge of its 
subject, and admirably adapted for its purpose. 

Miss Bertha Ellen Lovewell has edited " The Life of 
St. Cecilia " from a number of Middle English manu- 
scripts, and the monograph is published by Messrs. 
Lamson, Wolffe, & Co. in the series of " Yale Studies 
in English." 

Miss Emma Helen Blair has prepared a valuable 
"Annotated Catalogue of Newspaper Files in the Library 
of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin." The work, 
which is a pamphlet of nearly four hundred pages, ap- 
pears as a state publication. 

" A Short History of France " and " A Short His- 
tory of Germany," both by Miss Mary Platt Parmele, 
are now published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
in new editions, uniform with the similar volumes upon 
England, Spain, and the United States. 

Messrs. Allyn & Bacon publish two volumes of En- 
glish texts: "Select Essays and Poems " of Emerson, 
edited by Miss Eva March Tappan ; and " Three Nar- 
rative Poems " (" The Ancient Mariner," " Sohrab and 
Rustum," " Enoch Arden "), edited by Mr. George A. 
Watrous. 

Mr. F. C. Burnand, the editor of " Punch," has con- 
sented to write a series of articles giving personal remi- 
niscences of most of the authors and artists connected 
with that famous periodical during the last twenty-five 
years. The articles will appear in the " Pall Mall 
Magazine." 

A series of " Ethno-Geographic Readers " (Heath), 
by Mr. Frederick Starr, is to consist of three volumes 
41 Strange Peoples," " American Indians," and " How 
Men Do." The first and third of these are still in pre- 



paration, but the second has been issued, and proves to 
be a very readable account of the North American 
Indian, written in simple language, and attractively 
illustrated. The reading- lesson should be welcome to 
the boy who takes it from such a book as this. 

The late A. H. Green of Oxford left the manuscript 
of an unfinished text-book of elementary geology, and 
his widow commissioned Mr. J. F. Blake to prepare it 
for publication. The result is a volume called " First 
Lessons in Modern Geology," published by the Oxford 
University Press. 

The publishers of the Old South Leaflets have just 
issued two numbers entitled respectively " Lafayette in 
the American Revolution " and " Letters of Washington 
and Lafayette." The publication is most timely in view 
of the Lafayette monument, the gift of the American 
people, to be erected in Paris next year. 

Mr. John B. Dunbar has edited Cooper's " The Last 
of the Mohicans," for the series of " Standard English 
Classics " published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. It makes 
an attractive volume of more than five hundred pages, 
and the boy who has it for a school-book will surely 
think that his lot is cast in pleasant places. 

" The Technology Review " is a new quarterly peri- 
odical published by the Association of Class Secretaries 
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is mod- 
elled rather closely upon the " Harvard Graduates Mag- 
azine," which amounts to saying that it is a dignified 
and creditable production which we shall welcome to 
our table. 

The volume of " Studies in American History " just 
published by Mr. J. H. Miller, Lincoln, Nebraska, 
includes the ten pamphlets of " source extracts " made 
by Mr. Howard W. Caldwell, which we have mentioned 
from time to time as they have come to us, and for 
which we are happy to find a word of renewed com- 
mendation. 

" The Uncommercial Traveller," with four illustra- 
tions by Mr. Harry Furniss, has been added to the hand- 
some " Gadshill " edition of Dickens, imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The spirit of Cruik- 
shank and " Phiz " seems to have caught successfully

being especially good. 

Pending the construction of a new and modern build-

constantly increasing business, the Western Methodist 
Book Concern will occupy the large corner store of the 
Edson Keith Building, Wabash Avenue and Monroe

sellers' row " of Chicago. 

" The World's Painters and their Pictures " (Ginn), 
by Mr. Deristhe L. Hoyt, is an elementary descriptive 
and historical manual intended for school use. It is 
little more than a compendium of the barest facts and 
the most condensed critical judgments, supplied with 
enough process illustrations to save the text from being 
absolutely meaningless to a young student. 

The total destruction by fire of Messrs. A. C. McClurg

square south of the old location. 

We have received from the Century Co. the two 
bound volumes of " St. Nicholas " for 1898, as well as 
the volume of the " Century Magazine " for the half-

in these volumes, which is natural enough, but there are 
also other features of interest, including (as far as the 
" Century " volume is concerned) Dr. Mitchell's " Fran- 
ois " and a half dozen of Mr. Cole's superb wood- 
engravings. 

The death of Archibald Lampman, on the tenth of 
this month, at the early age of thirty-eight, is no small 
loss to Canadian literature and English poetry. His 
two volumes, " Among the Millet " and " Lyrics of 
Earth," together with his many contributions to the 
periodicals, gave him a high place among that remark- 
able group of young Canadian poets whose work has 
made us here in the United States look somewhat search- 
ingly to our own laurels. 

Professor William Morris Davis, with the aid of Mr. 
William Henry Snyder, has prepared a school " Physical 
Geography " which is published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
It is a volume of ordinary dimensions not the extra- 
ordinary ones that used to be associated with text-books 
of this subject very abundantly illustrated, and thor- 
oughly praiseworthy in its presentation of theories and 
facts. The name of Professor Davis, indeed, is all the 
guarantee of excellence that such a work needs. 

That readable literary magazine, " The Bookman," 
announces the publication in its pages of Mr. Paul 
Leicester Ford's historical novel of the American Rev- 
olution, " Janice Meredith," the first instalment to ap- 
pear in the March number. This story has already, we 
believe, been running for several issues in " Collier's 
Weekly." The " syndicate " method of publication, it 
would thus appear, is to be extended to the monthly 
magazines, a doubtful experiment, as it seems to us. 

A considerable quantity of French lyrical poetry, in 
which the most recent singers are fairly represented, is 
given us in the volume of " French Lyrics " which 
Professor Arthur Graves Canfield has edited for Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. Upwards of sixty poets are included, 
with an average of four pieces each, although the space 
given to Hugo, Lamartine, Musset, Leconte de Lisle, 
and M. Sully-Prudhomme makes this statement one to 
be taken with allowances. The book is excellent in 
every way in taste, scholarship, and sense of propor- 
tion. 

The Committee on Libraries and Schools of the 
National Educational Association is at present engaged 
in collecting materials for a report to be made next 
July. The subjects under consideration include the 
preparation of graded lists of books suitable for chil- 
dren, the correlation of public library and school work, 
normal school work in the use of books by teachers, and 
other related topics. There is a wide field of usefulness 
before this Committee, and the cooperation of all inter- 
ested persons is solicited by the chairman, Mr. J. C. 
Dana, Springfield, Mass. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons announce the publica- 
tion of " The American Anthropologist," a new quar- 
terly journal established under the auspices of the 
anthropological section of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science. The Board of Editors 



comprises such men as Messrs. D. G. Brinton, F. W. 
Putnam, W. H. Holmes, Franz Boas, and J. W. Powell 
in a word, the most distinguished American scholars 
in this branch of science. Each number will contain 
two hundred pages of text and illustrations. Four dol- 
lars is the annual subscription. 

The Association of Collegiate Aluinnge has recently 
added to its publications a " Magazine Number " which 
we have examined with much interest. No announce- 
ment is made of its continuation as a serial publication, 
but we wish that such an undertaking might prove prac- 
ticable, for a monthly, or even a quarterly, periodical of 
this character would be a welcome addition to our edu- 
cational literature. The contributors include such 
women as Mrs. Alice Upton Pearmain, Miss Abby 
Leach, Miss Marion Talbot, Miss Emily James Smith, 
Miss M. Carey Thomas, Miss Louise Brownell, and 
Mrs. Paul Shorey. Mrs. Shorey's interesting paper 
upon " The Collegiate Alumiife and the Public Schools 
of Chicago " affords a typical illustration of the sort of 
work the Association is doing, good unobtrusive work of 
a kind that might accomplish much for the betterment 
of public education. The publication is issued from 
Richmond Hill, New York.

Edited for School Use by 

EDWIN HERBERT LEWIS, Ph.D.,

endeavored to insert only such material as younger stu- 
dents can readily grasp and older ones cannot afford to 
neglect. A concise and spirited sketch of Cooper's life 
and work, with suggestions for study and an outline for 
the pupil's analysis of the novelist's well-known work, 
presents a fitting introduction to the novel.

The LETTERS of ROBERT BROWNING and 
ELIZABETH BARRETT BARRETT 

1845-1846. Illustrated with Two Contemporary Portraits of the Writers, and 
Two Facsimile Letters. With a Prefatory Note by R. BARRETT BROWNING, and 
Notes by F. G. KENYON, Explanatory of the Greek Words. 

Two Volumes. Crown 8vo, Cloth, Deckel Edges and Gilt Tops, $5.00. 

THE MARTYRDOM OF AN EMPRESS 

Elizabeth, Empress of Austria, is one of the most picturesque and at the same time one of the most com- 
pletely misunderstood figures in modern European history. This book is the story of her life, written not 
from the outside by a mere collector of records, but by one who saw and heard, a lady of her court, who was, 
moreover, an intimate personal friend, one of the very few to whom this remarkable woman ever really opened 
her heart. 

Illustrated. About 300 pages. Post 8vo, Deckel Edges, Gilt Top, 82.50.

[March 1, 



Story of the People of 
England in the 19th Century 

By JUSTIN MCCARTHY, M.P., author of 
"Life of Sir Robert Peel," "The 
Story of Gladstone's Life," etc. In 2 
vols., Nos. 53 and 54 in The Story of 
the Nations Series. Fully illustrated. 
Large 12mo, each, $1.50 ; half leather, 
gilt tops, each. $1.75. 
"The Story of England's Nineteenth Cen- 
tury" is a picture, rather than a record, of 
England's development in all the arts of peace 
since the close of the great war with Napoleon. 
Since that time a complete revolution has 
taken place in all that relates to applied and 
industrial science. Railways, ocean steam- 
ships, the electric telegraph, the submarine 
cable, the telephone all these are the growth 
of this wonderful century, which has done 
more for the practical movement of civiliza- 
tion than all the centuries that went before. 
The portraits of the great men who led all these 
different movements are carefully and vividly 
drawn, and the object is to impress the mind 
of the reader with a clear idea of each man and 
of each man's work in that period of English 
history. 

The West Indies. 

A History of the Islands of the West 
Indian Archipelago, together with an 
account of their Physical Characteris- 
tics, Natural Resources, and Present 
Condition. By AMOS KIDDKK FIBRE, 
A.M., author of "The Jewish Scrip- 
tures," " The Myths of Israel," etc. 
No. 55 in The Story of the Nations 
Series. Fully illustrated. Large 12mo, 
$1.50; half leather, gilt top, $1.75. 
The events of the past year have begotten, 
at least in the United States, a new and keener 
interest not only in Cuba and Puerto Rico, but 
in all of that great group of American islands 
which still remain so largely under European 
control. Professor Fiske's purpose has been 
to compress within the compass of one moder- 
ate volume, and yet to present with adequate 
form and color and in a popular style, the 
information about the West Indies their his- 
tory and physical aspects, their natural re- 
sources and material condition, their political 
relations, and apparent destiny which would 
meet the needs of that numerous but undefln- 
able person, the "general reader." 

The Life of George Borrow. 

The Life, Writings, and Correspondence 
of George Borrow, 1803-1881, author 
of " The Bible in Spain." " Laven- 
gro," etc. Based on Official and 
other Authentic Sources. By WILL- 
IAM I. KNAPP, Ph.D., LL.D., and late 
of Yale and Chicago Universities. In 
2 vols. 8vo. 

George Borrow was born in East Dereham, 
Norfolk, England, in 1803. At the age of seven- 
teen he was articled to a solicitor at Norwich. 
He spent much of his time studying languages, 
for which he had a great gift, acquiring among 
other tongues that of the gypsies. After much 
adventurous roaming and many struggles, in 
1833 he received the appointment as agent of 
the British and Foreign Bible Society, in which 
capacity he traveled extensively, learning with 
marvellous ease the language of each country 
visited by him. He was noted for his eccen- 
tricities, his fondness for the gypsies, his pas- 
sion for athletic exercises, bis scorn for the 
gentilities of life and his vigorous advocacy of 
the doctrines of the Church of England. Bor- 
row was the author of many works and trans- 
lations, the most important of these being 
" Lavengro " and " The Bible in Spain."

M. Boissier needs no introduction to an

previous books are already familiar with the 
simplicity and clearness of his style, and real- 
ize that his work is based upon a foundation 
of thorough scholarly knowledge.

Their Structure and Significance. By 
T. G. BONNEY, D.Sc.,LL.D.. F.R.S., 
Professor of Geology at University 
College, London. No. 5 in The .Science 
Series. Illustrated. 12mo, $2.00. 
The author has endeavored to lead the 
reader, through descriptions of the varied 
phenomena of volcanic action in the present 
and in the past, toward ascertaining by infer- 
ence the cause or causes of eruptions. The 
book opens with an account of " a living vol- 
cano," instances being given which explain it 
at every stage from birth to death. Then, 
after some preliminary explanations of certain 
technicalities, the author conducts the reader, 
as it were, to the dissecting theatre and points 
out what may be the discoveries in this method 
of study. In the last chapter he sums up the 
results to which his investigations have pointed 
and presents the conclusions to which they 
lead. 

New and Cheaper Edition. 

John Marmaduke.

Cromwell." Sixth edition. Illus- 
trated. 8vo, $1.25; Hudson Library, 
No. 35, 16mo, paper, 50 cts. 
The author has produced a thoroughly inter- 
esting story, abounding in stirring scenes 
which force themselves on the attention of his 
readers, and peopled with a sufficiency of clear- 
drawn, vivid, lifelike characters, the loveliest 
of whom, the heroine, Catharine Dillon, is an 
unforgettable woman.

vent to Ascension. By O. C. AURIN- 
GER and JEANIE OLIVER SMITH.

The New Far East. 

A Study of Present Political Conditions 
and Prospects. By ARTHUR DIOSY, 
Vice- Chairman of the Council of the 
Japan Society. With 12 illustrations 
from special designs by KUBOTA 
BEISEN, of Tokio, a reproduction of 
a cartoon designed by His Majesty the 
German Emperor, and a specially 
drawn map. 8vo, $3.50. 
The author, who is the founder of the Japan 
Society, shows that Japan is not only a trav- 
eller's paradise, " a pleasant land of beautiful 
scenery, a country inhabited by an interesting 
race, with charming, gentle manners," but 
also (as has been evident since her defeat of 
China) the land of a brave and serious nation 
of fighting and thinking men a nation capa- 
ble of being, and determined to be, a dominant 
factor in the Eastern world. China, credited 
until her overthrow with boundless stores of 
latent strength, is shown to be an inert mass, 
drifting toward disintegration. Mr. Di6sy 
sketches the changes in manners and customs 
that have produced " the new Japan," and 
concludes with a consideration of political con- 
ditions in the East, and a suggestion as to the 
expedient Oriental policy of England in the 
future. The book is illustrated by Kubota. 
Beisen, a Japanese artist well-known in this 
country, where he visited and held exhibitions 
of his work in 1893-1894. 

Lone Pine. 

The Story of a Lost Mine. By R. B. 

TOWNSHEND. 12mo, $1.25. 

A tale of the adventures of a white man in 
New Mexico with Indians, both honest and 
treacherous. The white man, by dint of good 
marksmanship with rifle and revolver, and also 
by dint of quick wits, rescues from marauding 
Navajoes the girl whom they have stolen, and 
vanquishes his enemies. The book is full of 
incident and of descriptions, accurate as well 
as picturesque, of life among the Pueblos. 

The Children of the Mist. 

By EDEN PHILLPOTTS, authorof " Down 
Dartmoor Way," " Lying Prophets," 
etc. 8vo. 

A realistic novel dealing with conditions in 
a Devonshire village. The author carries sev- 
eral families through ten years of life, showing 
how remarkably their destinies are interwoven. 
The main character is a quixotic young fellow, 
whose heady disposition constantly brings 
trouble upon him and his devoted wife, but 
who frees himself at last from his difficulties 
by force of honesty and bravery. Of this book, 
Mr. R. D. Blackmore, the author of " Lorna 
Doone," writes : " I was simply astonished at 
the beauty and power of this novel. A pleasure 
is in store for many, and literature is enriched 
with a wholesome and genial and noble tale." 

The Law and History of 
Copyright in Books. 

By AUGUSTINE BIRRELL. Q.C., Mem- 
ber of Parliament and Quaim Profes- 
sor of Law at University College, Ox- 
ford. 8vo, $1.25 net. 
The author of " Obiter Dicta," in his agree- 
able manner and perspicuous style, traces 
from its beginnings the history of public ac- 
knowledgment that an author has legal rights 
in the profits of his creations. Referring to 
this book, an authority in matters of copyright 
says : " It impresses me as an exceedingly 
effective presentation of the subject-matter, 
and I judge that it ought to be of service, not 
only to the legal profession, but also to libra- 
rians, literary men, and students of social 
conditions."

NEW AND REVISED EDITION. 

THE SCAPEGOAT. 

A Romance and a Parable. By HALL CAINE, author of " The 
Deemster," "The Bondman," "The Manxman," "The 
Christian," etc. New and revised edition. Uniform with 
the author's works. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" This book in its present form is new to American readers, although 
a book under the same title, telling practically the same story, was pub- 
lished in America seven years ago. That was just after the passing of 
the Copyright Act, and the effort to meet the conditions of the new law 
seemed to require that the romance should be published in what I knew 
was an immature and wholly unsatisfactory form. This was the form 
in which it was being published serially in English and American jour- 
nals, without the revision usually considered necessary for any piece of 
writing before its appearance as a book, and especially desirable in the 
case of the present work. . . . When health and opportunity allowed, 
1 did my best to make the story worthy of the reception it had received 
by an effort to lift its literary execution to the level of its artistic motive. 
" With these alterations, and with amendments made very recently, 
I am now offering ' The Scapegoat ' to American readers practically, I 
think, as a new book, certainly as a book which is in great part new." 
From the Author's Preface to the New Edition. 

A HISTORY OF JAPANESE LITERATURE. 

By W. G. ASTON, C.M.G., I). Lit., late Japanese Secretary to 
H. M. Legation, Tokio. A new volume in The Literatures 
of the World Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The author begins by denning the individual characteristics of the 
Japanese which have persisted in their literature in spite of the influ- 
ences of Chinese civilization and of Buddhism. His historical treatment 
opens with the songs and Shinto ritual of the archaic period from the 
fifth to the eighth century. It has been an essential part of the author's 
plan to include a very large number of translations of verse and prose 
as illustrations of his discussion of various epochs, tendencies, and 
genres. While Fitzgerald has made Omar Khayyam universally known, 
the Tanka of Otomo in praise of sake which is included among these 
translations, will be new to almost all readers, and it is safe to say that 
the book as a whole will introduce the majority of readers to a compar- 
atively new and fascinating field. 

GENERAL SHERMAN. 

By General M. F. FORCE. A new volume in the Great Com- 
manders Series. Edited by General JAMES GRANT WILSON. 
With portraits and maps. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
The author of this volume, a practiced writer and one of Sherman's 
division commanders, accompanied him in the Atlanta campaign and in 
the march to the sea. The book contains a finely engraved steel por- 
trait of the picture that General Sherman preferred, six well-executed 
maps of his most important battlefields, and a carefully prepared index.

THE CRUISE OF THE CACHALOT, 

Eound the World after Sperm Whales. By FRANK T. BUL- 
LEN, First Mate. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" It is immense there is no other word. I 've never read anything 
that equals it in its deep-sea wonder and mystery, nor do I think that 
any book before has so completely covered the whole business of whale- 
fishing, and at the same time given such real and new sea pictures. I 
congratulate you most heartily. It 's a new world that you 've opened 
the door to." Rudyard Kipling. 

"Mr. Bullen has given us an epic of whaling, and has presented it

THE LITERARY LIFE. 

There are many deserving persons to whom 
" The Pen and the Book " for thus is Sir 
Walter Besant's latest pronouncement entitled 
will bring cheer. They are the persons who 
fondly imagine themselves to be leading, wholly 
or in part, the Literary Life, yet who find the 
public looking somewhat askance at their pro- 
fession, and inclined to subject their pretensions 
to a considerable discount. They are haunted 
by the fear that their efforts will be disparag- 
ingly dubbed journalism ; or, even if it be ad- 
mitted that they produce what are to outward 
seeming books, that the harsh world will clas- 
sify these productions among the biblia a-biblia 
of Charles Lamb's famous catalogue. Smart- 
ing under such cynical thrusts, these worthy 
souls may take heart again at the words, 
" When, therefore, we speak of the Literary 
Life, it should include all those who produce 
literature." And, lest any modest scribbler 
should still be in doubt as to whether this 
definition is catholic enough to cover his own 
product, the assurance quickly follows : " I 
include the whole of current printed work 
good and bad, the whole production of the 
day whatever is offered." Being thus con- 
vinced that he is leading the Literary Life 
of which he may even have had no suspicion 
up to this time our supposititious writer will 
be pleased to read a little farther on, that " the 
Literary Life may be, in spite of many dangers 
and drawbacks, by far the happiest life that 
the Lord has permitted mortal man to enjoy." 
This is warming to the cockles of the heart, 
and he would be a morose penman indeed who 
could fail to catch something of the glow of the 
author's cheery optimism. 

Sir Walter's roseate imagination is at its best 
when he is engaged in a statistical presentation 
of the reading public, or when he is contrasting 
the Literary Life of the eighteenth century with 
that of the nineteenth or twentieth. " Look here, 
upon this picture, and on this," he seems to say 
as he pens the following contrasted passages : 

" Corae back with me for a moment to the middle of 
the eighteenth century. . . . Everybody proclaimed in 
some way or other by his appearance the nature of his 
calling: and everybody enjoyed in this way such dignity 
and respect as belonged to his calling. How did the 
poet appear? He was to be seen every day and all day 



144 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



long: he haunted the coffee-houses, the eating-houses, 
and the taverns of Fleet Street and its neighborhood. 
Alone among men he had no uniform. Yet he could be 
recognized by his rags. Everybody knew the company 
of wits in the tavern: they were notoriously, horribly 
poor; notoriously they had neither principles nor honour; 
nor dignity: for a guinea, it was said, they would write 
satires, epigrams, anything for or against either side or 
anybody. Since the people only saw the ragged side, 
they supposed that the whole army was in rags; it 
seemed to them the only profession whose normal or 
customary condition was one of rags. 

" Let us consider next what is the kind of life led 
daily by the modern man of letters not a great genius, 
not a popular author: but a good steady man of letters 
of the kind which formerly had to inhabit the garrets 
of Grub Street. This man, of whom there are many 
or this woman, for many women now belong to the pro- 
fession goes into his study every morning as regu- 
larly as a barrister goes to chambers; he finds on his 
desk two or three books waiting for review; a MS. sent 
him for an opinion ; a book of his own to go on with 
possibly *a life of some dead and gone worthy for a 
series ; an article which he has promised for a magazine ; 
a paper for the Dictionary of National Biography ' ; 
perhaps an unfinished novel to which he must give three 
hours of absorbed attention. This goes on, day after 
day, all the year round. There is never any fear of 
the work failing as soon as the writer has made himself 
known as a trustworthy and an attentive workman. The 
literary man has his club: he makes an income by his 
labour which enables him to live in comfort, and to ed- 
ucate his children properly. Now, this man a hundred 
years ago would have been what you have seen an 
object of contempt for his poverty and helplessness: the 
cause of contempt for Literature itself." 

The picture thus outlined for us of the life of 
the professional literary worker of our own 
times is certainly a pleasant one, and it does 
not seem to us overdrawn, except possibly as to 
the practical certainty of continuous employ- 
ment. It is, however, a life that is possible 
only in a very small number of the largest 
centres of population and publishing enterprise. 
In the United States, for example, it is unques- 
tionably possible in New York, precariously 
possible in about three other cities, and prac- 
tically impossible anywhere else. 

If Sir Walter works no great wonders with 
his descriptions, he certainly does with his 
figures. We may possibly allow his estimate 
that twenty thousand persons in England are 
to-day, wholly or in part, leading the Literary 
Life, although to do this the words " in part " 
must receive much emphasis, since the census 
returns show less than six thousand actually 
classified as authors, editors, and journalists. 
For the United States, we should have nearly 
to double these figures ; and we reflect, not 
without amusement, that even the lesser num- 
ber provided by the census must include the 
editors of country newspapers and the compilers 



of city directories. Still, we may admit that in 
this country forty thousand persons may pos- 
sibly, at some time or other, do some kind of 
writing for publication in books or periodicals. 
But when we come to Sir Walter's notion of 
the reading public, the imagination fairly balks 
at the figures offered for our acceptance. First 
of all, he estimates that in 1750 the " possible 
readers or inquirers after new books " numbered 
thirty thousand in the three kingdoms. Eighty 
years later, in 1830, this number may have 
increased to fifty thousand. So far, so good. 
These figures are certainly conservative enough. 
But when the author contemplates the reading 
public that to-day awaits the new English books, 
he loses the sense of proportion. Because one 
hundred and twenty millions of people all over 
the earth are able to read the English language, 
he assumes that most of them are eagerly fol- 
lowing the literary developments of the period. 
For seventy years ago, he will allow only one 
person in about five hundred to have been 
" interested in new books." Now, owing to the 
spread of popular education, he thinks of the 
whole five hundred (including children in 
arms) as readers. In other words, while mak- 
ing excessive reductions for the earlier years 
selected for comparison, he allows no deductions 
at all for the present and the future. This 
statement will seem so astonishing as to need 
a quotation in verification. Here it is : " In 
fifty years' time, unless some check some 
everwhelming national disaster happens to 
this country, or the United States, or to our 
colonies, the population of the English-speaking 
race will be more than doubled. There will be 
at least two hundred and fifty millions all of 
them, on an average, far better educated than 
at the present moment, and all readers of 
books." We are willing to allow an enormous 
increase in the present ratio of readers to non- 
readers, as compared with the ratio of 1830 ; 
but if the latter be taken as one to five hundred, 
the former can hardly be taken as larger than 
twenty-five to five hundred. 

The sort of arithmetic wherewith Sir Walter 
seeks to enhance the opportunities of the Lit- 
erary Life of the present day must be illus- 
trated more specifically. We are willing to be 
liberal, and to accept, for example, the conclu- 
sions of the following sentence : " Sixty years 
ago there was no Chicago at all : now there is 
a city with two million inhabitants, of whom 
one-half are decently educated and read books, 
and quite one hundred thousand are interested 
in new literature." Observe, however, that this 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



145 



is a ratio of only one to twenty, as compared 
with the author's ratio for 1830, and is a very 
different thing from the claim that nearly 
everybody belongs to the audience upon which 
a new writer can count. This is simply an 
appeal from Philip drunk with optimism to 
Philip sober in the presence of facts. But we 
cannot find much sobriety in the author's no- 
tions of the number of readers to be reckoned 
for each individual copy of a book or periodical. 
He actually counts an average of twenty readers 
for every copy of a magazine and five hundred 
for every copy of a book. To say that these 
estimates are wild is to use moderate language. 
One of the most popular of our American 
monthlies some years ago claimed a million 
readers on the strength of an average circu- 
lation of two hundred thousand copies. We 
thought this claim of five readers to a copy 
excessive, and the publishers obviously went as 
far as they dared in making it. But Sir Walter 
would give them four millions of readers instead 
of a poor single million. As for the five hun- 
dred readers that Sir Walter counts for each 
copy of a popular novel, we must insist upon a 
discount of at least ninety-five per cent. 
Twenty-five readers would be a generous esti- 
mate, and we doubt if a circulating- library 
copy ever got up to the five hundred mark. 
Most books would be in tatters after going 
through the hands of one hundred, or at the 
most two hundred, readers. 

It is evident that the above remarks are not 
to be taken as a review of " The Pen and the 
Book." Indeed, we have not touched upon its 
main contents, which embody an elaborate 
setting-f orth of the commercial aspect of author- 
ship, although we may take up this subject in 
the near future. As a champion of the writer 
in his relations with the publisher, Sir Walter 
has been a stout fighter for many years past, 
and in this book he presents the results of a 
thorough, practical investigation of the methods 
of publishing and the cost of producing books. 
He has made many enemies by his work in this 
field, and his assertions have occasioned a great 
deal of acrimonious debate. We have read a 
considerable quantity of this controversial mat- 
ter, and are bound to say that Sir Walter is 
armed cap-a-pie to meet his assailants, and that 
he usually has the best of the argument. We also 
wish to say that writers inexperienced in deal- 
ing with publishers will find profitable reading in 
" The Pen and the Book," to say nothing of the 
pleasure to be got from its skilful literary pre- 
sentation of a subject of much general interest. 



LITER AR Y STANDARDS. 

When and where is to appear the true Prophet of 
the Literati, he who is to stand and cry, Behold 
the ideal taste, the perfect writer, the Ultimate 
Authority ! We hear much about the " best literary 
taste," and the conscientious toilers of the pen, those 
who have not yet reached the comfortable conclu- 
sion that they know it all, spend many an anxious 
hour in self-examination, more or less illuminated by 
the feeble " glims " of favorable or adverse critics. 

What a help and comfort it would seem to be, 
alike to writers, readers, and publishers, if some 
literary Mahomet might arise to declare with con- 
vincing power, " There is but one Standard, and I 
am its Prophet ! " Then all of us or at least all 
afflicted with a conscience might give o'er the 
weary search for the ideal, for we would know just 
what to write about and how; and readers who 
valued their mental and moral status would know 
just what to read ; and the world's shelves would 
groan no more under the load of books which infal- 
lible publishers have brought to an ill-conceived 
birth. 

But would we? Even though a literary angel 
should come from Heaven with unimpeachable cre- 
dentials, would it make any appreciable difference ? 
Would the number of false and foolish books be 
seriously diminished? Would the millions leave 
off soddening their none too nimble wits in a steep 
of sickly sentiment and vapid thought? I fear not. 

And yet every writer who has high ideals, and 
has, besides, the saving grace to feel dissatisfied with 
his own accomplishment, has moments when he 
longs for one clear, sure voice amid the cackle of 
conflicting criticism, one bright, fixed polestar in 
the uncertain sky. He has tasted the " classics," 
only to be more fully persuaded how wisely and 
wittily Mark Twain has described them. He sam- 
ples modern models, only to find many men, many 
minds. Each author has his constituency of ad- 
mirers ; to others he is either indifferent or alto- 
gether anathema. One is too psychological, another 
is all " fight and love " stories ; one is naughty with- 
out being nice, another too nice to be either naughty 
or interesting ; here one discusses " problems," there 
it is a problem that he is discussing ; this one ser- 
monizes, that scandalizes ; one is too smart, another 
too simple ; this one buries his little grain of thought 
in a bushel of verbiage, that one sends forth the 
children of his brain too scantily clothed for de- 
cency ; alike in the dense air of realism and in the 
rarified air of hyper-idealism we gasp for breath : 
and so it goes. 

In such a state of things, what is the writer and 
reader to do who is ambitious to improve his style 
and cultivate his taste : is he to go with the crowd, 
calling all things good which others call good, or is 
he to lay himself open to the charge of conceit and 
presumption by daring to exercise his independent 
judgment, even of the Immortals? Is it all a delu- 
sion, anyhow, this talk about higher and lower 



146 



THE DIAL, 



[March 1, 



taste, the distinction heing as valid as that well- 
known difference between, orthodoxy and hetero- 
doxy ? If there is no absolute standard, how shall 
one taste be higher or another lower? Perhaps, 
after all, it is only a matter of time, circumstance, 
and luck. 

Worse yet, the past sheds no light on the present 
or the future. The books which delighted the 
fathers excite in us either distaste or the very gentle 
interest of the " classicist." Books change and we 
change with them ; but is it up or down ? In short, 
is there any real literary evolution? 

There is but one way out of this fog of other 
people's tastes and opinions : to see that our ques- 
tion is only one phase of a much larger one. That 
question is world-wide and world-old : Pontius Pilate 
was not the first to ask it ; it knows no bounds 
of time or space. The whole literary, moral, and 
social order, nay, even the universe itself, ravels 
out into a pitiful reductio ad dbsurdum unless we 
assume the existence of an Absolute Standard of 
truth and beauty. This is a necessity, not of reli- 
gion only, but of sanity as well. 

A second postulate is equally imperative: the 
soul of man is made in the image of that Standard, 
and its normal growth is along the lines of eternal 
verities. 

These two postulates being granted, things begin 
to clear up. Now we are less anxious to know what 
A, B, and C think of the thoughts we have written, 
than to know they are true. Now we can go on 
bravely and hopefully, our only concern being the 
normal development of that germ of the Infinite 
within us. Now we know that all distortions of 
truth, all affectations of beauty, being violations of 
eternal laws, must come to naught ; whatever vogue 
they may have at first, they are ephemerae. 

But the path, though clearer, is still far from 
easy. Eternal vigilance is the price of sanity. The 
beginnings of error are as infinitesimally insidious 
as the microscopic germs which infect the body ; 
and the mind has a fatal facility for repeating an 
error once begun, until it becomes a bias, then a 
habit, and finally a characteristic. Life is a Sisy- 
phean task of sifting and weighing, of making 
errors and correcting them, but ever " approximat- 
ing nearer and nearer to the limit of the variable," 
as the mathematicians say. That limit is Perfect 
Judgment. That is the goal and rest of all this 
fitful fever. 

In all this struggle to approximate the truih, of 
course the wise will not neglect the help to be derived 
from others' taste and judgment ; but once the evi- 
dence on any point is all before us, it is ourselves who 
must decide. Of course we shall make mistakes, 
that, all are bound to do in any case ; but better 
sometimes wrong than always servile. Let us go 
forward bravely, in the full assurance that the laws 
of our being are the laws of Infinite Right. 

But there is one essential condition, without it 
there is no progress and no sanity : we must be abso- 
lutely honest with ourselves. How can he know 



truth who lies even to his own soul ! He (or she) 
who, for love of gain or fame, cajoles himself to 
believe that wrong is right ; who, for pride or con- 
ceit of opinion, will not allow himself to see his 
error ; who twists the truth to fit a story or a theory ; 
who from love of ease seeks not to know the truth, 
or stifles it for fear of others' criticism, none such 
need ever hope for perfect judgment or perfect taste. 
Truth is the oxygen of the soul. While they im- 
agine they are clever, they are fools, for they are 
asphyxiating their own souls to an eternal death. 

But would not the subjection of all literature to the 
test of truth be a long step backward, reducing us to 
sermons and scientific theses? By no means, even 
granting that sermons and theses are invariably ves- 
sels of truth. Broadly speaking, all literature which 
makes for the betterment of man, either directly, 
or indirectly through saneful wit and humor, is true 
literature. It need not be professedly moral, but 
its influence must not be immoral. To that extent, 
Tolstoi is right. All literature which presents ideas 
with which the facts do not agree ; which excites 
silly, morbid, or vulgar feelings and aspirations ; 
which makes a jest of that which is sacred, shame- 
ful, or revolting; which vulgarizes by too great 
familiarity with vulgarity ; which makes the wrong 
appear the better reason ; which apotheosizes vice 
or calls buffoonery humor, all such literature, of 
infinite variety of shade and grade, is either dis- 
tinctly vicious or at best is trashy. No wonder that 
such fatal and fantastic notions of life and happi- 
ness shock the world by working out their logical 
and inevitable conclusions in crime and suicide from 
the flood of trash literature continually poured forth, 
even through our public libraries, to glut the morbid 
appetite of those least able to discriminate. 

But is there any best literary style? The best 
style is any style which best subserves the ends of 
true literature. It is a mistake to take for granted 
that there is no longer room for originality in style, 
treatment, or subject. Well worked though the 
field now seems to be, there are doubtless undiscov- 
ered tracts of virgin soil only awaiting the pioneer 
pen to laugh back with as rich a harvest as has 
ever yet been seen. To the fathers, who found per- 
fect satisfaction in " Rasselas " or " The Vicar of 
Wakefield," it doubtless seemed that the Ultima 
Thule of popular literature had been reached ; now 
those literary superlatives are relegated to the dig- 
nified and dubious limbo of " classics." The varia- 
tions of the written thought, as of all things human, 
are the variations of the human soul ; and they are 
infinite. 

Three examples out of many illustrate this point 
of originality : Carlyle, Emerson, Kipling. Each 
had an independent mind, which, boldly desert- 
ing the trodden paths, struck out for itself into the 
woods an original line of thought and style. At 
first the world, always shy of truth in unaccustomed 
guise, refused to follow ; now it hails them gladly 
to Parnassus. 

But these were geniuses. Verily ; yet we who, 



1899.] 



147 



alas, are only common clay, may profit by their ex- 
ample. We too are free to try new paths in style 
and subject ; perchance even we can find something 
to write about fresher than the worn-to-death rela- 
tion of the sexes, and tell it in a best way of our 
own devising. Mr. Stephen Crane made the attempt 
gallantly enough, but only half-successfully. His 
well-praised, well-execrated little book holds a few 
gems of expression which glisten like diamonds in 
a dreary waste of sand. Mr. Crane's psychology 
is positively painful ; but in " The Ked Badge of 
Courage " he really struck a new lead in flashlight 
word-pictures which is worth developing ; some day 
the man or woman is coming who will do it, if he 
does not. 

Poets are born, publishers are made : writers 
must be both born and made. None need lose 
heart, for none can say what is in him until he has 
done his best. But right here is the danger point. 
That Best is no Jonah's gourd, but a plant of slowest 
growth, fed by thought, study, and experience, 
mayhap watered by tears and watched with care, 
only to bloom as the westering shadows lengthen. 
But whether or no it bloom in this world is a minor 
matter ; the great matter is, Have we written our- 
selves down as a part of the Truth and the Beauty 
which are Eternal ? " Let each paint the thing as 
he sees it, for the God of things as they are."

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

SCHOOL LEGISLATION FOR LARGE CITIES 

AND SMALL. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Recent and current school legislation for cities is 
rightfully attracting attention. With the illustration of 
the Cleveland law and its six years of trial, sufficient 
evidence is presented of the efficacy of at least some of 
the changes thereby accomplished. The discussion and 
presentation of the subject so far contemplates and 
provides for the conduct of schools in large cities only. 
The measures presented by the Chicago Commission, 
also of the Detroit Committee, are quite similar. In a 
general way, the belief that they suggest needed reforms 
is generally accepted. For the thirty cities in the 
country reported by the Commissioner of Education as 
exceeding one hundred thousand population, the propo- 
sition stated must be accepted as pointing to a more 
efficient school administration. Provision for these 
thirty cities, if applicable to them alone, leaves nearly 
six hundred other cities with a population exceeding 
eight thousand, the schools of which are all at least of 
equal importance to the country with those of these great 
cities. 

It will be found that the two chief features of the 
proposed reform are: first, the divorce of the board of 
education from executive duty, and confining it to leg- 
islation ; second, the placing of the direct personal 
responsibility where a strict account for acts can be de- 
manded and easily given. 

While it is possible that the framers of the proposed 
legislation have in mind primarily, as the Chicago Com- 



mission announces, that organization which shall be best 
for a given city, it will be found that a city which for 
any reason is unable to provide and maintain two dis- 
tinct departments in administration namely, business 
and educational if the board confine itself to legisla- 
tion, can unite the two under one executive officer. 

The superintendent of schools in smaller cities is able, 
or should be able, to execute not only efficiently on the 
educational side but also on the business side. Observa- 
tions of several smaller cities in the country illustrate 
that where this has been the practice for a series of 
years the schools have been accorded a measure of 
reputable standing. While modifications will be de- 
manded of the Detroit, St. Louis, or Chicago plan, for 
cities of fifty thousand people, they will be slight; but 
the erection of divers departments in other than large 
cities will bring embarrassment financially, and ulti- 
mately an unsatisfactory outcome. 

As Dr. Hinsdale said in your last issue, it may be that 
no single type of system will follow the present interest 
in this subject. To my mind it is reasonably certain 
that a general type of management of schools in cities 
will be found to exist ere long, not only in the thirty great 
cities of more than one hundred thousand people, but also 
in the cities of less size. It is not so great a misfortune 
that thought and study has been exclusively for the great 
communities; but, after all, if a commission similar to 
the Chicago Commission should undertake to formulate 
a plan for cities in the neighborhood of fifty thousand 
people, more communities would be directly benefitted 
than at present. AARON GOVE.

THE RENAISSANCES IN JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

It is a trite but none the less true saying, that " his- 
tory repeats itself." The capture of Constantinople by 
the Turks in the fifteenth century scattered the learned 
men of the East and their learning over the West, and 
produced throughout Europe a Renaissance whose vast 
influence has never yet been accurately measured, and 
which was undoubtedly one of the chief elements in 
modern civilization. Again, it was Tartar hordes, which, 
about two hundred years later, overthrew the reigning 
native dynasty of China, and unwittingly produced in 
the neighboring land of Japan a Renaissance which led 
ultimately to the Restoration of 1868, and was evidently 
one of the chief elements in the civilization of New 
Japan. For, as the Greek scholars, fleeing from Con- 
stantinople, took refuge in various countries of Europe, 
likewise many patriotic Chinese scholars fled from their 
native land and took refuge in Japan. Or, as the fugi- 
tive Greek savants stirred up throughout Western Eu- 
rope a revival of learning, in like manner the fugitive 
Chinese scholars aroused in Japan a deeper interest in 
Oriental learning. 

The influence exerted in Japan by the learned Chi- 
nese refugees, especially by one named Shu Shun-sui, was 
considerable. This one man was in 1665 invited by 
Mitsukuni, the famous Prince of Mito, to take up his 
abode with that clan. The Mito Prince was at the time 
engaged in the preparation of the " Dai Nihon Shi," or 
" Great Japanese History," which " had so powerful an 
influence in forming the public opinion which now up- 
holds the Mikado's throne "; and he invited the assist- 
ance of at least one of these Chinese scholars in correcting 
this work, which was written in Chinese. And although 
there is no positive evidence that this assistance extended 



148

beyond textual correction, yet it is not at all improbable 
that even this slight opportunity was utilized for teach- 
ing loyalty to the central authority. 

But, besides the direct and indirect literary work of 
these learned refugees, we must not lose sight of the 
deeper interest which, by their very presence, was nat- 
urally aroused in the study of Chinese literature and 
philosophy. It is, of course, a difficult matter to trace 
clearly the extent of such influence; but it is generally 
admitted by those who have studied the subject, that 
the presence of Chinese literati in Japan did give a 
greater impetus to learning. It is, indeed, true that the 
revival of learning had, before their arrival, begun un- 
der the auspices of lyeyasu himself, who, after he had 
conquered a peace, reorganized the Empire on the f uedal 
basis, and practically settled upon the policy of seclu- 
sion and crystallization, " determined also to become 
the architect of the national culture." He encouraged 
study, especially of the Chinese classics, and stimulated 
education. It is, therefore, no wonder that the Chinese 
savants received a warm welcome; and it seems, under 
the circumstances, as if they had " come to the king- 
dom for such a time as this." 

But this Renaissance had a still wider influence, which 
extended even to political affairs. There were, in fact, 
three lines along which the Japanese were gradually led 
back to Imperialism. One line was Confucianism, which 
taught loyalty ; another was historical research, which 
exhibited the Shogun as a usurper; and a third was the 
revival of Pure Shinto, which accompanied or followed 
the second. But the Japanese so modified Chinese 
Confucianism as to substitute loyalty for filial duty as 
the most important element. " The Shinto and the 
Chinese teachings became amalgamated in a common 
cause, and thus the philosophy of Chu Hi, mingling with 
the nationalism and patriotism inculcated by Shinto, 
brought about a remarkable result." To change slightly 
the figure used above, the Japanese were led over three 
roads from Feudalism to Imperialism. There was the 
broad and straight highway of historical research: on 
the right side, generally parallel with the main road, 
and often running into it, was the path of Shinto; on 
the opposite side, making frequently a wide detour to 
the left, was the road of Confucianism; but eventually 
all these roads led to Kyoto and the Emperor. 

It seems as if, with the aid of Chinese savants, the 
famous Mito Prince, Mitsukuni, the "Japanese Maece- 
nas," a scholar himself and the patron of scholars, set 
on foot a Renaissance in literature, learning, and poli- 
tics, and has been appropriately styled " the real author 
of the movement which culminated in the Revolution of 
1868." And the effects of this Renaissance aie still 
being felt in another Revival of Learning, this time along 
Occidental lines. To what will this new Revival lead ?

AN ENGLISH VERSION OF "BARBARA 

FREITCHIE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In his admirable work on " Stonewall Jackson and 
the American Civil War," the author, Colonel Hender- 
son, says of his hero: " So general was the belief in his 
stern and merciless nature, that a great poet did not 
hesitate to link his name with a deed which, had it actu- 
ally occurred, would have been one of unexampled 
cruelty. Such calumnies as Whittier's ' Barbara Frit- 
chie,' " etc. (Vol. I., p. 80.) 



The point is not important but one wonders where 
the " calumny " is in Whittier's poem, or what sort of 
a version of it circulates in England. The poem merely 
says that when Jackson rode up the street of Frederick 
City at the head of his troops, and " the old flag met 
his sight," he ordered his men to blaze away at it, which 
they did; but later, when the owner of the flag, Dame 
Barbara, appeared on the scene and snatched the fallen 
flag, and leaned far out o'er the window-sill and shook 
it forth with a royal will, Jackson announced that any- 
one who touched a hair of her gray head should die like 
a dog, or words to that effect. 

The facts on which the poem is based have been dis- 
puted, and the whole thing is perhaps a little apochry- 
phal; but it is hard to see where the "unexampled 
cruelty " would come in, were everything actually true 
that is stated in the poem. j. Q.. j^

"DEATH TO THE SPANISH YOKE." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Apropos of the various discussions of war poems that 
have appeared in THE DIAL, I would like to call your 
attention to one which has no greater defects than many 
which have been exploited as the war poems of the cen- 
tury. Its publication was anonymous. 

The verses contain, at least, elements of what Stev- 
enson calls " the fervid participation of the moment." 
Whether they exhibit any marked poetic talent, the 
reader may judge for himself.

Westfeld, Mass., Feb. 16, 1899. 

[Our correspondent's letter makes us anxious to 
have it understood that the discussions, and not the 
war poems, are what have appeared in THE DIAL. 
We print this war poem, however, and with it the 
lines from which it is clumsily and impudently 
cribbed, in order that " the reader may judge for 
himself " as to its " poetic talent," and especially 
its quality of " fervid participation of the moment " 
which our correspondent discerns in it. It is a hard 
thing to say of our Jingo poetry, that this is no worse 
than most of it ; but we fear it is true. We do not 
wonder it was published anonymously. EDB. DIAL.]

THE MEMORIALS OF LOUD SELBORNE.* 

The concluding instalment, in two sizable 
volumes, of the late Earl of Selborne's " Me- 
morials " is mainly a restatement of the author's 
views on the major public questions which arose 
during the period covered (1865-1895), and 
an explanation of his professional and official 
course regarding them. Some of the chapters are 
rather freely diluted with matter that will inter- 
est Lord Selborne's relatives and closer friends 
rather than the public at large ; but the volumes 
on the whole may safely be pronounced solid and 
informing, if not especially animated or graphic, 
additions to the large and growing stock of 
reminiscences of Victorian times. Lord Sel- 
borne's gifts and temperament were hardly such 
as to qualify him to shine as a writer of memoirs 
of the lighter personal and reminiscential order, 
a species of writing in which many a social 
trifler equipped with a lively pen and a taste 
for gossip might easily have excelled him. Of 
chat about notable contemporaries, therefore, 
the volumes will seem to many readers to con- 
tain disappointingly little. 

That Lord Selborne, where the subject was 
an imposing one and where his sympathies were 
deeply engaged, was no mean hand at painting 
a portrait and defining a character, his strong 
and refreshingly independent characterization 
of Gladstone conclusively shows. Now that 
Mr. Lecky has, in a recent preface, calmly pro- 
nounced " the texture of Mr. Gladstone's intel- 
lect " to have been of the " commonplace " 
order, we may confidently look to see the inev- 
itable reactionary tide of disparagement of the 
Grand Old Man of liberalism and parliament- 
ary manosuvre fairly set in. Much evil has of 
course been spoken of Mr. Gladstone in the 
past by his political foes, who, not content with 
attacking his policy, have impugned his motives, 
and even attempted to injure his character by 
the foulest aspersions. But detraction of that 
sort is politics, not criticism ; and we suspect 
that the recent verdict of Mr. Lecky himself 
regarding the quality of Mr. Gladstone's intel- 
lect is tinged by his known opinion of the 
quality of Mr. Gladstone's measures, more 
especially his Irish agrarian measures ; for it is 
difficult for even a philosopher to admit that a

fruit he happens to personally dislike can spring 
from any but an inferior and weakly tree. Lord 
Selborne disagreed pretty sharply with Mr. 
Gladstone on some points, almost from the first 
years of their connection ; and he was very far 
from keeping pace with his early oracle and 
paragon in the latter's dramatic yet gradual 
and deliberate advance from the one extreme 
to the other of British opinion. This advance 
(the term is perhaps open to criticism as a 
question- begging one) Lord Selborne, who had 
himself gathered caution and conservatism with 
ripening years in the usual and normal way, 
must have inwardly regarded as a sort of intel- 
lectual and political Rake's Progress on the 
part of the once u rising hope " of all that was 
venerable and established in England. Nor 
does he refrain from using language of some 
bitterness when he comes to speak of the clos- 
ing phase of Mr. Gladstone's career. If it be 
true, says Lord Selborne, that down to the end 
of June, 1886, Gladstone " kept the great con- 
troversy on the heights," it was certainly not 
long afterwards that he ceased to do so, his 
power of self-persuasion affecting his moral 
judgments in a way that would have been 
deemed impossible in earlier years. In the con- 
stant stress and turmoil of electioneering since 
1886, in which he played the leading part, there 
was little to remind men of the Gladstone of 
old, save the old eloquence, energy, and daunt- 
less courage, qualities more remarkable than 
ever when displayed by the man past eighty. 

"A new ' transmigration of spirit' cauae over him; 
he accepted it with as much alacrity and apparent self- 
satisfaction as if it had always been so; he invested it 
with the authority of his age, his name, his character; 
and under its influence the statesman was transformed 
into the demagogue. Mr. Parnell became, for four years, 
until he himself broke the spell, the special object of his 
admiration ; and other violent spirits of the ' League ' 
were glorified as heroes and martyrs. . . . He became 
the apologist of the methods by which his new allies 
carried on their warfare against landlords and the law 
in Ireland. . . . All sorts of schemes for parliament- 
ary interference with rights of property, and with 
the freedom of capital and labor, budded and blos- 
soined under the capacious shelter of the new Liberal 
umbrella,' not without a sanguine hope that, in the good 
time coming, they would be entertained by the great 
leader 'with an open mind': and there was no 'plain 
speaking' to discourage that hope. What the final 
issue of these things may be, cannot be foretold; but if 
it should be the decay and degradation of British states- 
manship, and the triumph of anarchical forces, hostile 
to the life of freedom, while they shout her name,' Mr. 
Gladstone will have contributed to it more than any 
other man."

stone's peculiarities as a statesman, Lord Sel-

borne hits, not infelicitously, upon the Emperor 
Joseph II., as drawn by Mr. Lecky. 

" Ambitious, fond of power, and at the same time 
restless and impatient, his mind was to the highest de- 
gree susceptible to the political ideas that were floating 
through the intellectual atmosphere of Europe; and he 
was an inveterate dreamer of dreams. Large, compre- 
hensive, and startling schemes of policy, radical 
changes in institutions, manners, tendencies, habits, and 
traditions, had for him an irresistible fascination." 

Impatient of opposition to his opinion of the 
moment, Mr. Gladstone's opinions were in a 
constant and continuous state of flux and de- 
composition. His view of any given question 
of importance was changing, even while he was 
maintaining it with the zeal and apparent con- 
viction of a prophet. " With great appearance 
of tenacity at any given moment, his mind was 
apt to be moving indirectly down an inclined 
plane." Mr. Gladstone could be quoted against 
Mr. Gladstone on almost any leading or funda- 
mental public question whatever. To find a 
powerful and convincing plea against what 
Mr. Gladstone was urging to-day, you had only 
to turn back to what Mr. Gladstone was urging 
yesterday. Agrarian schemes that yesterday 
were stigmatized as " rapine " and " plunder " 
were extenuated and even justified to-day as 
quite excusable and useful moves in a patriotic 
Plan of Campaign. " Boycotting," that in 
1882 was denounced as " combined intimida- 
tion, made use of for the purpose of destroying 
private liberty of choice by fear of starvation, 
inflicting ruin, and driving men to do what 
they did not want to do, and preventing them 
from doing what they had a right to do," be- 
came, after 1886, under the magic of Mr. Glad- 
stone's faculty of self-persuasion and matchless 
dialectic, mere " exclusive dealing," or a form 
of trades-unionism that was " the only available 
weapon for the Irish people, in their weakness 
and poverty, against the wealthy and powerful." 

It would be easy to go on quoting from the 
tale of Mr. Gladstone's thousand and one 
" magnificent inconsistencies " (as his hardier 
admirers called them) in proof of the, to our 
thinking, not very damaging fact that the au- 
thor of them was as different as could be from 
the more common type of man who goes through 
life a complacent slave to the faith he was born 
in. But Lord Selborne's strictures clearly go 
deeper than the charge of mere inconsistency. 
If we are to accept his view unreservedly (which 
we do not), Mr. Gladstone became in his later 
years of political activity " a demagogue," 
an inflamer of popular animosities, of class 
hatreds and class cupidities, all this for the 



sake of personal popularity and party advan- 
tage. He degenerated into a sort of " Sand 
Lots " haranguer of genius, the more dangerous 
because of his genius. He was not honest, 
either with himself or with others. 

" He had a wonderful power of not seeing what he 
did not like. He was a master of the art of throwing 
dust into the eyes of those who were proper subjects for 
that operation; and he could practise it not less skil- 
fully upon himself." 

Let us turn for a moment to the lights of Lord 
Selborne's by no means altogether or intention- 
ally disparaging portrait of his former chief. 
The secret of Mr. Gladstone's great popularity 
he finds in the opinion generally entertained of 
the purity of his motives, the elevation of his 
character, in his sympathy with the people and 
desire for their good, rather than in his energy, 
eloquence, and intellectual gifts. Humanity 
turned to him naturally, as to a friend, as to 
one who felt more than other men of like gifts 
and station the common kinship of all. 

" His private life was indeed without a flaw. . . . He 
preferred misconstruction to missing opportunities of 
doing good. . . . His interests were wide and cosmo- 
politan; his acquirements were multifarious, and all at 
his command. He was a lover of music, poetry, the 
drama, and the fine arts. . . . He spoke more than one 
European language almost as easily as his own. He 
was very high, if not first, in the first rank of modern 
orators ; an orator of the diffuse florid kind, Ciceronian 
rather than Demosthenic, lofty when dignity was neces- 
sary, and at all times fluent and animated; abounding 
in illustration and metaphor ; every word in the right 
place, every sentence well turned." 

American readers will be particularly inter- 
ested in Lord Selborne's account of the 
" Alabama " arbitration. He was consulted 
professionally by his government during the 
negotiations prior to the Treaty of Washington, 
and he acted as counsel for Great Britain be- 
fore the Geneva Tribunal. The maltreatment 
of this country by the British authorities dur- 
ing the Civil War, in the matter of the Con- 
federate privateers, is now res adjudicate/, and 
admitted and deplored matter of history. But 
Lord Selborne, with an advocate's obstinacy, 
still endeavors to put America in the wrong. 
If we won our case at Geneva it was mainly 
through our bluster and chicane, through the 
bias of arbitrators, through the generous for- 
bearance of Great Britian, that is the spirit 
of his contention. He intimates that our nego- 
tiators at the outset felt the importance of 
" either complicating the question by irrelevant 
issues, or to some extent prejudicing it by the 
terms of reference." He hints darkly at the 
" wiles and subtleties " of the American law-

yers, at the " loaded dice " with which America 
was allowed by the Rules to " play the game of 
hazard." With a wooden insensibility to the 
essential fact that in the eyes of America the 
trial at Geneva was symbolic, that America 
stood at the bar of the Tribunal, not as a mere 
claimant of so many dollars and cents in a suit 
for damages, but to demand moral satisfaction 
and moral reparation in the sight of the world 
for a great wrong, Lord Selborne sneers at 
the feeling injected into the American " Case." 
Its tone, he complains, "was acrimonious, totally 
wanting in international courtesy." Perhaps it 
was. Perhaps the American " Case " was es- 
sentially such that not to state it in strong 
language would be tantamount to not stating it 
at all. Perhaps a nation still smarting under 
the recollection of the jeers, contumely, and 
material damage inflicted upon it by a " neu- 
tral " power, while its own hands were tied by 
civil war, was justified in revealing a sense of 
wrong even in a formal statement of its griev- 
ances. The question is often asked, " Why does 
America dislike England ? " and ingenious ex- 
planations are offered. But there is a plain 
and sufficient answer to that question, and that 
is, " Because England has shown in the past 
so often and so offensively that she disliked 
America." She never showed it so conclusively 
as during our Civil War, when our difficulties 
absolved her from the immediate need of cau- 
tion. The " Alabama " incident was but a 
flagrant episode in the painful story of the atti- 
tude toward us of the British Government and 
the British cultured and influential classes dur- 
ing that period. Russia alone stood our friend, 
our friend in need ; and to forget that now 
would be the blackest ingratitude. 

What was the " Alabama " ? Let us answer 
that question in the words of a distinguished 
Englishman, Mr. W. E. Forster, the friend 
and colleague of John Bright, who stood the 
eloquent champion of the North, while Mr. 
Gladstone was complacently proclaiming that 
Jefferson Davis " had made an army, had made 
a navy, and, more than that, had made a na- 
tion." Said Mr. Forster : " The 'Alabama ' was 
a British ship, built by British ship-builders, 
and manned by a British crew ; she lured prizes 
to destruction under a British flag, and was 
paid for by money borrowed from British cap- 
italists." All the logic-chopping and learned 
technicalities of Lord Selborne at Geneva could 
not obscure those facts. During her two-years 
cruise the "Alabama" took some seventy North- 
ern vessels, and literally drove our commerce 



from the seas. As an English historian says : 
" She went upon her destroying course with the cheers 
of English sympathizers and the rapturous tirades of 
English newspapers glorifying her. Every misfortune 
that befell an American merchantman was received in 
this country with a roar of delight." 

Let us add that when the " Alabama," in 
her first encounter with an antagonist of any- 
thing like her own class and armament, was 
shot to pieces after a brief engagement, her 
fate was mourned sincerely and patriotically by 
a chagrined British public. It was the last 
action between a British and an American 
vessel. 

The student of the questions of church and 
law reform dealt with in these concluding vol- 
umes will find Lord Selborne's reflections 
thereon of no little value. The correspondence 
with which the work is freely interspersed is of 
fair interest, and the author's occasional devia- 
tions from the dignified, if somewhat diffuse, 
exposition of his own political views into the 
lighter paths of reminiscence will be welcomed 
by the average reader. The editing has been 
conscientiously done by Lady Sophia Palmer, 
Lord Selborne's daughter and literary trustee. 
The volumes are notably well made and con- 
tain several portraits. E. G. J. 



THE SECOND YEAR or THE CIVIL WAR.* 

Mr. Ropes is giving to the world what seems 
likely to be the standard history of our great 
Civil War. As we took occasion to say when 
his first volume appeared, he approaches his 
work in the spirit of a historian and not as an 
advocate of any general or any policy. Now 
that a third of a century has elapsed since the 
close of the war, the leading actors have all 
passed off the stage, and the country has en- 
tered upon a new era of its history, there seems 
to be no reason why a really impartial and 
authoritative narrative of that period cannot be 
written ; and there is much to warrant the 
opinion that Mr. Ropes has produced that nar- 
rative in its broad lines and its general judg- 
ments of individuals and of movements and 
campaigns. 

The volume opens with the startling victory 
at Forts Henry and Donelson, which broke the 
Confederate line and recovered Kentucky and 
Tennessee for the Union. The incapacity of

General Halleck is shown at the outset, and 
continuously through the whole volume. It 
becomes clear that he undertook this campaign 
recklessly, without the knowledge of his supe- 
riors and without the cooperation of his asso- 
ciate commanders in the West. Mr. Ropes 
asserts that Halleck "had no scheme in his 
mind," and that jealousy was a probable mo- 
tive of his precipitate action. The administra- 
tion was planning a campaign in East Tennes- 
see ; Halleck was afraid that his command 
would be absorbed in that of Buell, so he 
plunged into his campaign and compelled the 
government to follow his lead. It was probably 
the wisest move he could make ; but the man- 
ner of making it, and the way in which it was 
followed up, deserve the severest censure. 

The next step shows the "great reckless- 
ness " of General Grant at Pittsburg Landing. 
It was known to him and to his superior officer, 
General Halleck, that the enemy was near in 
great force ; yet the army was retained in an 
exceedingly faulty position, with no outposts, 
no preparation to receive the enemy, no line of 
battle or defense. The various camps were 
established without system or plan of coopera- 
tion. " All the well-known maxims of war 
applicable to such a position were absolutely 
unheeded by General Grant. Probably there 
never was an army encamped in an enemy's 
country with so little regard to the manifest 
risks which are inseparable from such a situa- 
tion." The Union generals estimated the ene- 
my's forces at eighty thousand, against forty 
thousand of their own forces ; yet they were 
blissfully unexpectant of an attack, and when 
it came it was a complete surprise. Grant was 
not on the field for several hours after the en- 
gagement opened, and even after he came every 
general acted for and by himself. He is de- 
clared to have been at that time " incapable of 
assuming the entire control and direction of a 
great battle," and " not equal to an emergency 
of this magnitude." The opportune arrival of 
Buell's troops enabled Grant to win a great 
victory the second day ; but then came his 
lamentable failure to follow up and destroy the 
demoralized enemy. There was no reason why 
he should not have done so, but " he utterly 
failed to seize the opportunity," " he entirely 
failed to rise to the height of this occasion." 
If he had done what he might have done, the 
Confederacy would have been irretrievably 
weakened by the annihilation of one of its two 
great armies. Evidently, Grant had not yet 
found himself. 



We cannot follow the interesting discussion 
of the several campaigns of the eventful year 
of 1862, and must content ourselves with stat- 
ing a few of Mr. Ropes's judgments of men 
and events. It is interesting to contrast his 
estimates of the leading Federal generals with 
those of the enemy. Those of the North, with 
the simple exception of Buell, are shown to 
have been failures more or less complete. Hal- 
leck, McClellan, Pope, and Burnside make a 
poor showing beside A. S. Johnston, J. E. 
Johnston, and Lee. The appointment of Hal- 
leck, though the natural one at the time, was as 
bad as could have been made. He was without 
insight to detect the crisis of a campaign, or 
energy to strike when the moment of advan- 
tage came. He is shown, in this impartial nar- 
rative, as a weak man, self-confident, greedy of 
power, ready to assume responsibility, unwill- 
ing to cooperate generously with his associates, 
guilty of disastrous blunders. He was not a 
soldier by temperament or ability, though he 
had written a highly esteemed book on the art 
of war and was accounted an authority on mili- 
tary questions. 

In his discussion of General McClellan and 
the famous Peninsular Campaign, Mr. Ropes is 
much less harsh than most writers, though the 
General's weaknesses are plainly indicated. 
His constitutional slowness, his excessive cau- 
tion, his inability to estimate his enemy's power 
and his consequent failure to take advantage of 
his opportunities to strike a fatal blow, all 
these well-known defects are clearly shown. 
But his skill as a tactician and organizer, and 
as a leader of men, are also set forth ; and 
though his career as a whole- is shown to be a 
failure, and his defects the cause of the loss of 
many thousands of lives and of the prolonga- 
tion of the war, the reader feels that full jus- 
tice has been done him. He, too, had oppor- 
tunities, during this eventful year, to inflict a 
fatal blow upon the enemy ; but he failed to 
use these opportunities, and hundreds of thou- 
sands of lives were the penalty of his incompe- 
tency. As for Pope and Burnside, there is no 
need of taking space to show that Mr. Ropes 
agrees with all other writers in declaring them 
almost absurdly incompetent for the high posi- 
tions to which they were appointed. 

So, while the administration was groping 
about for competent leaders for its armies, it 
was training them, at fearful cost, for future 
victories. Meanwhile, the civilians at the head 
of the government, having little confidence in 
their military agents, interfered and directed,

and made the bad conditions worse. It is a sad 
story, but may as well be frankly told. 

The Confederates, on the other hand, were 
able to find at the outset competent leaders for 
their armies. These, too, made blunders, and 
many of them ; but they were able men, and 
used the forces committed to them wisely and 
on the whole successfully. Of General Lee 
Mr. Ropes says : 

" In intellect it may be doubted whether he was supe- 
rior to the able soldier whom be succeeded; . . . but 
in that fortunate combination of qualities physical, 
mental, and moral which go to make up a great com- 
mander, General Lee was unquestionably more favored 
than any of the leaders of the Civil War. . . . Lee's 
position was unique ; no army commander on either side 
was so universally believed in so absolutely trusted. 
Nor was there ever a commander who better deserved 
the support of his government, and the affection and 
confidence of his soldiers." 

Lee was undoubtedly reckless, astonishingly so, 
in his operations during this year, and gave 
many opportunities to his enemies. But he 
knew the calibre of the men opposed to him, 
and that he could take liberties with them 
which he could not have taken with competent 
generals ; and the results justified his reckless 
boldness. He depended greatly, too, on his 
able subordinates, especially Stonewall Jack- 
son, who never but once failed him. 

A portfolio of excellent maps accompanies 
the volume. We shall look with interest for 
Mr. Ropes's next volume, which will deal with 
the stirring campaigns of Chancellorsville and 
Gettysburg in the East and Vicksburg in the 
West. CHARLES H. COOPER. 



THE FUNCTIONS AND REVENUES OF 
GOVERNMENT.* 



The word " finance " has been persistently 
used in English, both in everyday usage and 
to some extent even in the works of economic 
writers, as a general term referring rather 
indefinitely to the whole range of monetary and 
commercial affairs. But the Science of Finance, 
in the more correct sense in which Professor 
Adams uses the term, has to do only with pub- 
lic expenditures and public income, and the 
relations necessarily involved in their consid- 
eration ; it " undertakes an analysis of the wants 
of the State and of the means by which those 

* THE SCIENCE OF FINANCE. An Investigation of Public 
Expenditures and Public Revenues. By Henry Carter Adams,

the University of Michigan. (American Science Series 
Advanced Course). New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



wants may be supplied." Problems of money, 
currency, and banking, which have to do merely 
with the mechanism by which financial opera- 
tions are carried on, are not admitted to a place 
in the science ; much less are questions of 
" private financiering," such as have to do with 
the management of business corporations. It 
was natural enough that the same word should 
be popularly applied to the revenues of states 
and cities and to the funds of private corpora- 
tions, but this double use of the word has led 
to no little confusion. 

Nearly all writers on the Science of Finance 
devote comparatively little attention to expendi- 
tures, or else neglect that side of the subject 
altogether ; and the result in either case is un- 
satisfactory. It would seem that public expendi- 
tures, considering the variety and importance of 
the objects for which they are incurred, might 
well receive even more attention than the man- 
ner of meeting them ; but the science of public 
expenditures is as yet undeveloped, except as a 
mere introduction to the study of revenues. 
Professor Adams has, indeed, done not a little 
to develop it, first in his " Relation of the 
State to Industrial Action " and to some extent 
in his " Public Debts," and now in his more 
comprehensive " Science of Finance." He says 
that " the Science of Finance has no opinion 
respecting the question of the proper limit of 
public duties," but his actual treatment of the 
subject is by no means so inadequate as this 
disclaimer might lead one to expect. A few 
passages by way of illustration : 

" It is futile to urge disarmament, and the consequent 
extinction of the military budget, so long as there con- 
tinues to be a conflict of legal ideas. ... It is no acci- 
dent that the first approach to a successful tribunal for 
the arbitration of international disputes should rest upon 
negotiations for a treaty between England and the 
United States, for these peoples practise the same sys- 
tem of jurisprudence. Their theory of rights, and the 
method by which they aim to enforce those rights, are 
the same. A standing international tribunal resting on 
agreement between England and Russia, however, or 
between the United States and China, is beyond the 
range of reasonable expectation at the present time ; for 
it is only upon the basis of a common system of juris- 
prudence that a system of international law can be 
developed which shall render the preparation for war 
unnecessary." 

" A local government may very properly enter upon 
a more comprehensive line of activities than the national 
government, since the more restricted the territory over 
which a government has jurisdiction, the greater likeli- 
hood will there be of community of interests among its 
citizens." 

" It seems probable, when one regards the social evils 
wrought by corporations in certain industries of collec- 
tive interests, that local governments at least will ex- 



154

pand rather than contract the sphere of government 
administration." 

" It is essential for the modern State to support pub- 
lic instruction, because there is no other way to guard 
against the fading of its own ideals through the rise of 
an aristocracy of learning. It is natural thatinstitutions 
that look to the wealthy for further endowments should 
be influenced in their administration by the interests of 
the wealthy class; . . . and it requires no great insight 
to perceive that the final result of exclusive reliance 
upon private benefactions for any phase or grade of ed- 
ucation will be that the instruction provided will riot 
only reflect the interests of a class, but will be confined 
to a class. ... A State which aims to perpetuate de- 
mocracy cannot decline to make ample provision at 
public expense for all phases and forms of education. 
In no other way can a system of public instruction, which 
is by far the most potent agency in shaping civilization, 
be brought to the support of democracy." 

Again, we are told that the normal law of 
public expenditures for the enforcement of fac- 
tory legislation, and for public commissions, is 
that such expenditures will continue to increase 
until industrial development has run its course, 
or until the character of government itself shall 
have been changed by some great upheaval ; 
that governments must continually increase the 
amount of money at the disposal of their statis- 
tical service ; that expenditures for forestry, 
irrigation, and public improvements for the ben- 
efit of commerce will also increase with the 
growth of society ; but that, on the other hand, 
expenditures for the protective functions of the 
State, as distinguished from its developmental 
functions, tend to decrease in proportion as the 
protective service of the State succeeds. There 
is here at least the foundation of a science of 
public activities. 

Professor Adams rejects the statistical method 
of studying public expenditures, and confines 
himself to a theoretical discussion, because the 
former could not be satisfactorily applied, and 
because the latter is essential in any case. But 
besides the a priori method on the one hand 
and the purely statistical method on the other, 
there is the historical - comparative method, 
which is often applied to particular problems 
of public economy, and might be employed in 
developing the science as a whole. A theoret- 
ical treatment, even when so philosophical as 
that of Professor Adams, is not wholly satis- 
factory, because the considerations which de- 
termine governmental action are of an eminently 
practical nature, and may easily vary from 
place to place ; while at the same time a merely 
statistical study would not be enough, chiefly 
because the more important results of govern- 
mental action are incapable of quantitative 
measurement. Neither political philosophy nor 



statistics, therefore, ought to be expected to 
determine what are the proper functions of 
government. 

The consideration of public revenues also 
involves a study of certain governmental activ- 
ities, which Professor Adams classifies into 
industries undertaken for the purpose of secur- 
ing revenue, those in which revenue is incidental 
to service, and those undertaken primarily for 
service ; and for each class a distinct rule is 
given for the adjustment of charges. The main 
division of the work, however, is devoted to 
Taxation. Here, after elucidating the princi- 
ples, and approving progressive rates as being 
most in accordance with individual ability, the 
author devotes a chapter to " Suggestions for 
a Revenue System." He would assign to the 
federal government the taxation of interstate 
commerce, in addition to the customs and ex- 
cise duties ; to the States he would give taxes 
on the business of corporations, other than 
interstate commerce, and on inheritances ; and 
to the local governments he would assign taxes 
on land, on professional incomes, on licenses, 
and on municipal franchises. The theoretical 
basis of this proposed arrangement is that each 
government should tax those industries with 
which it holds some fundamental or constitu- 
tional relation. 

Twelve years ago Professor Adams wrote 
that " one of the chief difficulties under which 
we in this country suffer, in our endeavors to 
solve the problem of monopolies, arises from 
the fact that our publicists and statesmen pro- 
ceed in profound ignorance of the meaning and 
purpose of the science of finance." For that 
ignorance they have no longer any excuse.

Two GREAT EVANGELISTS.* 

An evangelist, in a broad sense, is one with 
a gospel message who goes about rousing men 
to a higher and better life. Matthew Arnold 
was a literary evangelist, proclaiming every- 
where by word of voice and pen the gospel of 
literary culture. Henry Drummond, as is evi- 
dent from Dr. George Adam Smith's masterly 
biography, was above all else a Christian evan- 
gelist, filled with a glowing love, who stirred 
men of all circles and conditions, by voice and 
printed word. But Drummond's greatest work

was with the educated classes, and particularly 
with college students ; and the movements which 
he set on foot with them are still powerful and 
progressive. Drummond's sincerity, open- 
mindedness, intellectuality, and sympathy with 
science, made him the friend and helper of vast 
numbers whose religious life was being troubled 
by doubts suggested by science. The enormous 
success of his " Natural Law in the Spiritual 
World," and of many of his Addresses, lay in 
his identifying Nature with Christianity, and 
showing the natural foundation of Christianity 
as a law of love. From whichever side we take 
Drummond's position, as either naturalistic 
Christianity or Christianized naturalism, it was 
a gospel of a reconciliation of science and relig- 
ion which appealed very powerfully to his read- 
ers and hearers. 

" To Henry Drummond, Christianity was the crown 
of the evolution of the whole universe. The drama 
which absorbed him is upon a stage infinitely wider than 
the moral life of man. The soul, in its battle against evil, 
in its service for Christ, is no accident or exception, thrown 
upon a world all hostile to its feeble spirit. But the 
forces it represents are the primal forces of the universe ; 
the great laws which modern science has unveiled sweep- 
ing through life from the beginning work upon the side 
of the man who seeks the things that are above." 

Professor Smith opens his work with a strong 
sketch of the man in his winning personality. 

" We watched him, our fellow-student and not yet 
twenty-three, surprised by a sudden and a fierce fame. 
Crowds of men and women in all the great cities of our 
land hung upon his lips, innumerable lives opened their 
secrets to him, and made him aware of his power over 
them. When his first book was published, he, being 
then thirty-three, found another world at his feet; the 
great of the land thronged him; his social opportunities 
were boundless; and he was urged by the chief states- 
man of our time to a political career. This was the 
kind of a trial which one has seen wither some of the 
finest characters, and distract others from the simplicity 
and resolution of their youth. He passed through it 
unscathed; it neither warped his spirit nor turned him 
from his accepted vocation as a teacher of religion. . . . 
There- was a never a glimpse of a phylactery nor a 
smudge of unction about his religion. He was one of 
the purest, most unselfish, most reverent souls you ever 
knew, but you would not have called him a saint. The 
name he went by among younger men was The Prince'; 
there was a distinction and a radiance upon him that 
compelled the title." 

While Professor Smith cannot easily and nat- 
urally call a man who plays cricket and bil- 
liards and enjoys a good cigar a " saint," yet 
he compares Drummond's influence to that of 
a mediaeval saint. He was the confessor of 
multitudes of men and women of all classes. 

" They brought him alike their mental and phys- 
ical troubles. Surest test of a man's love and holiness, 
they believed in his prayers as a remedy for their dis- 



eases and a sure mediation between their sinful souls 
and God. It is with a certain hesitation that one asserts 
so much as this, yet the evidence in his correspondence 
is indubitable; and as the members of some great 
churches are taught to direct their prayers to the fam- 
ous saints of Christendom, so, untaught and naturally, 
as we shall see, more than one have since his death 
found themselves praying to Henry Drummond." 

Professor Smith traces and emphasizes Drum- 
mond's progress from the strict orthodoxy of 
his early life to his later more enlarged and 
liberal views by which his evangelism gained 
power with men of high education and thought. 
Evolutionary Science and Biblical Criticism 
came to have great weight with him, and he 
gave up verbal inspiration, and found in rev- 
elation an evolution. ,.'.; 

A clear account is given of Drummond's 
evangelism in Glasgow, with Moody and San- 
key, and among British, American, and Aus- 
tralian students. This book also includes letters 
and diaries of travel in America, Africa, and 
the new Hebrides. These are often bright and 
vivid, as in this African sketch : 

" At Zomba, on the Sabbath, we had a service for the 
natives the real ' Missionary Record ' kind of a thing; 
white men with Bibles under a spreading tree, sur- 
rounded by a thick crowd of naked natives. We sang 
hymns from a hymn-book in the native tongue to Scotch 
psalm-tunes, and then spoke through an interpreter. 
Unfortunately, the service was brought to rather an 
abrupt conclusion. I had just finished speaking when 
a tremendous shriek rose from the crowd, and the con- 
gregation dispersed in a panic in every direction. A 
hugh snake had fallen from the tree right into the thick 
of them. A bombshell could not have done its work 
faster, but no one was hurt, and the beast disappeared 
like magic beneath some logs. The snakes rarely do 
harm, and I have never heard of a serious case." 

While we cannot say that this book is over- 
eulogistic, yet we miss the marks of common 
and weak humanity. Drummond does not ap- 
pear to have had a redeeming vice ; we should 
have felt better satisfied to have known, say, 
that at least once in his life he got angry and 
swore profanely. Peter and Paul and all the 
saintly characters of Scripture have their fail- 
ings, but Drummond stands out in these pages 
as an admirable and perfect Crichton. But, 
after all, we are glad to believe that here is the 
highest type of Christian knight, sans peur et 
sans reproche, an ideal soul, earnest, tender, 
true, of noblest spirituality and deepest sincer- 
ity. But we cannot esteem Drummond a great 
man, nor yet that he attained his full stature 
and maturity. We feel that here was a prom- 
ising tree forced to too early and abundant 
fruitage, and so exhausted for the most mature 
and permanent work. Professor Smith has

certainly given us an able and interesting his- 
tory of an eager, high-wrought soul, plunged 
in the vortex of our later nineteenth century 
life, moved by most manifold currents, and yet 
attaining a most noble and useful life. 

Another great evangelist, who resembled 
Drummond in his power of Christian love, but 
was more narrow in his interests and straighter 
in his orthodoxy, was Newman Hall. We have 
from his pen a chatty and pleasant " Autobi- 
ography," in which he seeks to keep out of 
" the track of ordinary religious memoirs " in 
not speaking exclusively of his public career 
and religious experience, but also speaking 
freely of himself in all his relations with the 
men of his time, and narrating incidents of all 
kinds. He tells a number of first-rate stories, 
two of which we must quote. At Ferriby, 
"The old parish clerk one Sunday surprised the con- 
gregation by announcing, in his usual monotone, Let us 
sing to the praise and glory of God, a psalm of my own 
composing a psalm of my own composing!' ... In 
a family of my church was a devoutly-behaved dog, 
which regularly occupied its accustomed seat at family 
prayers, and remained motionless till the ' Amen ' at the 
close. One day when I was conducting the service, I 
read the fifth chapter of the Revelation, and when I 
came to the fourteenth verse, ' And the four beasts said 
Amen! ' the dog jumped from his chair and began bark- 
ing as usual, as if all were over. This was too much 
for the assembly's gravity; host and hostess, servants 
and friends, could not prevent laughter blending with 
barking, and the service ended with the dog's ' Amen.' " 

Dr. Hall gives a chapter to Gladstone, which 
throws some light on that statesman's character. 
There is also interesting mention of his ac- 
quaintance with John Bright, Lord Shaftes- 
bury, Dean Stanley, Spurgeon, and others. 
Newman Hall's pastorates, both in Hull and 
London, were thoroughly evangelistic in their 
nature. It was at Hull that he composed the 
tract " Come to Jesus," which has circulated by 
the million. During the Civil War, Dr. Hall 
was influential as a friend of the North, and 
his American evangelizing tours, of which he 
gives a sketch, will be recalled by many. The 
mild and gentle spirit, the fervid and simple 
piety, of the author pervades his book, which is 
of interest on many accounts, and has consid- 
erable value for the religious historian.

TRAVEL, IN MANY LANDS.* 



Arctic exploration has received a new impetus 
within the last decade. The ice-bound lands in the 
frigid zones have suddenly assumed a new import- 
ance. Sir Martin Conway's experiences in Spitz- 
bergen since the beginning of 1896 have done much 
to set us right in our estimate of that country. The 
results of his first adventures, in 1896, were em- 
bodied in his " First Crossing of Spitsbergen." The 
present volume, " With Ski and Sledge over Arctic 
Glaciers," is to be regarded as an appendix to that 
account. In company with Mr. E. J. Garwood, a 
geologist and photographer, and two Norwegians, 
this undaunted Englishman set out to investigate 
many of the tremendous glaciers, ice fjords, and 
lofty snow and ice mountains of this arctic land, 
four hundred miles north of North Cape, and unin- 
habited by any permanent population. To read 
the crisp account of their tramps over ice gorges 
and chasms, through blinding snowstorms, and on 
their ski. or snowshoes, is close akin to enjoying 
the same experiences. An expert's popular descrip- 
tion of the movements of a great glacier, and of its 
final crash into the waters of the bay, is a bit of 
exceedingly good reading. The important result of 
this brief two months' trip was the determination 
of the fact that Spitsbergen is not, as held by earlier 
explorers, covered with an ice-sheet. This term 
does not describe the condition of things in arctic 
lands, and should be expunged from the geograph- 
ical vocabulary. The so-called ice-sheets are merely 
glacial and mountain areas on either side of water- 
sheds tending toward the sea. Neither do glaciers 
excavate great valleys, as popularly held. The 
familiar, easy method of telling his story inspires 
confidence in the author's knowledge and his ability 
to arrive at sound conclusions.

In " Through Arctic Lapland " we have the nar- 
rative of two daring Englishmen who set sail from 
London to test their adventurous spirits in the far 
north. They land at Yards, on the north coast of 
Finland, in early summer. Their goal is the Gulf 
of Bothnia, four hundred miles overland toward the 
south. To discourage them at the outset, they find 
that in the summer no route of travel exists in that 
direction ; in fact, the frequency of lakes and 
swamps makes such an adventure next to impossible. 
But the doughty Englishmen push ahead, secure 
short-route guides, travel double the straight-line 
distance, wade through swamps, row across lakes, 
float down rivers, tramp through forests, until, weary 
yet wiser men, they hail the sails of a Swedish ves- 
sel in the northernmost harbor of Bothnia. These 
polyglot and much-travelled travellers show a prodi- 
gious amount of pluck in enduring hardships, man- 
aging obstreperous Lapps and Finns, fighting mill- 
ions of vicious musquitos, and keeping good-natured 
through it ill. The customs and habits of the peo- 
ples of that almost solitary country are told in a 
humorous and spicy narrative by Mr. Cutcliffe 
Hyne, amply illustrated by the sketches of Mr. 
Hayter, the author's companion. 

Chitrdl is located on the Chitral river, one of the 
sources of the Indus river, up in the district of the 
Hindu Kush mountains. " The dominant note of 
Chitrdl," says Sir George S. Robertson, author of 
" Chitral, the Story of a Minor Siege," " is bigness 
combined with desolation ; vast, silent mountains 
cloaked in eternal snow, wild glacier-born torrents, 
cruel precipices, and pastureless hillsides where the 
ibex and the markhor find a precarious subsistence." 
Down deep in the gorges of these oppressive and 
ever-present mountains resides a restless and 
wretched population of natives, controlled almost 
wholly by the devotees of Mohammed. The con- 
test for sovereignty among the native claimants to 
the throne precipitated a revolution in the winter of 
1894-95. Chitnil is almost on the borderland 
between British India and Afghanistan, and was 
under the protectorate of England. The assassina- 
tion of the local ruler led to an attempt by the ruler 
at Kabul to assume control of the district. The 
British Indian troops which had gone to the rescue 
were defeated, driven within their fort, and besieged 
for nearly two months. In the meantime, detach- 
ments of native soldiers under English officers were 
hurrying, in the dead of winter, from the north and 
from the south to rescue their comrades. Some of 
these men were ambushed, others were taken by 
treachery, and still others suffered untold hardships 
in crossing snow-capped and snow-bound mountains. 
The besieged gallantly held out, through great suf- 
fering, until the approach of English troops caused 
the flight of the besiegers and the rescue of the be- 
sieged. This is a thrilling and tragical story, told 
in chaste and forceful language by the commander 
in the siege. Its political significance gives it a 
value which far outranks that of ordinary books of 
war or of travel. 



The far-reaching influence of a medical mission- 
ary, especially that of a wise woman, among the 
vast populations of India, is shown with surprising 
effect by Dr. Armstrong-Hopkins in her book en- 
titled " Within the Purdah." The down-trodden, 
hopeless condition of woman, not only in the secluded 
harems of princes but in open air everyday life, is 
enough to make one either pessimistic or actively 
energetic in inaugurating new means of relief. While 
the British government has done much to mitigate 
the deadly power of vicious customs, there is a wide 
chasm between the woman of India and ordinary 
comfort and freedom. This book shows where Great 
Britain and other enlightened nations can accom- 
plish marvels for this caste-enslaved and suffering 
people. The native princes can be won by shrewd- 
ness and skill of the right kind to banish heartless 
and harmful rites, and to order themselves and their 
subjects according to higher principles of govern- 
ment and human right. 

The Yangtse is to China what the Mississippi is 
to the United States. It drains the heart of China, 
embracing an area of 600,000 square miles, with 
a population of about 180,000,000 of as industrious 
and peaceful a people as are to be found on the 
earth's surface. This area is now known as the 
" British sphere of influence." Its great river is 
navigable by the largest ocean steamers as far as 
Hankow six hundred miles inland ; then for five 
hundred more by steamboats to Ichang. From this 
point upwards it is almost one succession of gorges 
and rapids, through a most picturesque and wild 
country, though densely populated. English trade 
on the banks of this river has reached enormous 
proportions. Ten years ago, Professor A. J. Little, 
author of " Through the Yangtse Gorges," excited 
his influence to push navigation farther up stream. 
After the China-Japanese war he succeeded in se- 
curing concessions of various kinds. Within the 
past year he has himself conducted a steamer through 
several dangerous series of rapids five hundred miles 
above Ichang to Chung-king, the highest point of 
steam navigation yet reached. In addition to a 
clear and concise narrative of the methods of navi- 
gation and difficulties encountered on the way, Mr. 
Little shows by statistics the wonderfully rich re- 
sources of this inland empire, this river empire. The 
power of English diplomats and merchants is seen 
in every gain made in the confidence of the China- 
man. The book is full of rare incidents observed 
by a wide-awake scholarly Englishman. 

The Malay peninsula proper, extending south- 
ward from Indo-China, is 850 miles long by 210 in

Its territory embraces about 82,000 square miles,

acknowledges that he is more skilled in the use of

the parang, to cut his way through the jungles, than 
in the use of the pen. Mr. Rathborne takes his 
own method of telling his story. He describes with 
great detail many of his numerous tramps and trips 
back and forth through the peninsula and along its 
shore lines. Mingled with this description of the 
immediate occurrences of his trip, we find frequently 
little scraps of early history as in the case of 
Malacca, accounts of curious habits of the wild 
animals of the jungles, illustrated by some experi- 
ence of his own, and of the character of the natives. 
Incidentally, the resources, the products, the mixed 
population, the dangers, and the prospects of the 
country receive ample mention. The lack of good 
roads, the thickness of the forests, the lurking wild 
beasts, and the enemies of human life, on the land 
and in the air, tested the patience and endurance of 
this Briton. The English government, though able 
to do much for the natives, has not lived up to its 
opportunity (p. 126). It has not suppressed, but 
rather has encouraged by licensing, some of the 
worst vices in the land. In spite of these things, 
the British forces have suppressed the state of an- 
archy of two decades ago, and are gradually lifting 
the natives up to a higher plane of living. The 
whole story is enlivened by vigorous illustration. 

Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard's " Cruise under 
the Crescent " is a chatty record of his tour along 
the conventional route of travellers to Syria. In a 
very familiar, off-hand style, he describes his jour- 
ney from Port Said to Jerusalem, to Damascus, to 
Baalbek, to Beirut, to Athens, to Stamboul, and so 
on. The text is besprinkled with sketches, many 
of them giving quite an adequate idea of the thing 
represented. The observations of the author show 
in an interesting way the impressions made upon 
the acute mind of an intelligent traveller. 

The Greco- Turkish war was short, sharp, and de- 
cisive. But its results cannot be measured. Many 
shrewd and acute correspondents were on the field 
to note for permanent preservation the events of 
each day. Mr. Rose, author of " With the Greeks 
in Thessaly," must have been, we judge, among the 
best of these. This compact little volume testifies 
to his activity and descriptive power. He was the 
special war correspondent of Reuters, London, and 
consequently had the best of opportunities for close 
observation on the field. The political matters dis- 
cussed are based, says the author, upon information 
of men who were close to the political movements 
of the day. The narrative preserves with great 
faithfulness the exact form in which it was written 
in the heat of conflict. The plans and maps help 
one to secure a very vivid picture of that sudden 
and, to the Greeks, disastrous plunge of the Turk- 
ish army into Thessaly. 

Central Africa has not ceased to be of genuine 
interest, both to the diplomat and to the anthro- 
pologist. In the heart of that Dark Continent are 
many unexplored regions and unsolved mysteries. 
Captain Burrows, author of " The Land of the Pig- 
mies," had many facilities, as an officer in the em- 



ploy of Belgium, for wide observation. The char- 
acter of the native tribes in different districts of the 
Congo Free State are extremely interesting. The 
cannibal natives are not all extinct, but rather flour- 
ish, though in the presence of the white man they 
endeavor to conceal their custom. The pigmies of 
Central Africa, though occupying but small space in 
this volume, are a unique little people, whom Cap- 
tain Burrows had good opportunities for studying. 
Many of the real problems of Central African trade 
are yielding to the introduction of the railroad and 
its increasing activities. Enough illustrations are 
inserted in this book to make it a picture-volume of 
Central African peoples and customs.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



More history of 
the Royal Navy. 



With Volume III., now ready, Mr. 
William Laird Clowes's monumental 
and lavishly equipped history of 
" The Royal Navy " (Little, Brown, & Co.) passes 
the half-way stage in its progress toward completion 
in the forthcoming fifth volume. The sufficiently 
comprehensive and liberal lines on which the work 
was projected we have already set forth somewhat 
fully in our review of the opening instalment (THE 
DIAL, Sept. 1, 1897). The present volume covers 
the civil history of the Navy, the major and minor 
operations of its military history, and the record of 
voyages and discoveries, during the period 1714- 
1792, inclusive. The contributors are Mr. William 
Laird Clowes, Mr. L. Carr Laughton, Sir Clements 
R. Markham, and Captain A. T. Mahan Captain 
Mahan's quota occupying about a third of the vol- 
ume, and treating in that admirable naval writer's 
usual masterly way of the major operations of the 
War of the American Revolution. Owing to the 
unexpected length of some of the articles, the editor 
has been compelled to reserve Mr. W. H. Wilson's 
chapter on the minor operations of the Revolution 
for inclusion in the volume next forthcoming. Mr. 
Clowes takes occasion to allude in his preface in 
laudatory terms to the recent exploits of the Amer- 
ican Navy at Santiago and " Manilla " (as he elects 
to spell it), and to indicate a hope that when the 
British sailor's turn at the laurels shall come he 
will be found in no way inferior to his " brothers of 
the New World." It is to be feared that the British 
sailor's professional anxiety to emulate the recent 
achievements of these same long lost and newly dis- 
covered American " brothers " may prove a not 
inconsiderable stumbling-block in the way of disarm- 
ament projects and peace ideals generally. Mr. 
Clowes's work is not, and cannot reasonably be 
expected to be, quite impeccable in point of minor 
errors of detail that might have been rectified by 
searching and constant reference to original sources. 
We are inclined to admit the reasonableness of his 
plea that " to be content with nothing short of abso- 
lute completeness and finality in an undertaking of 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



159 



this kind " would involve the drawback that " neither 
the initiator, nor, after his death, any of his suc- 
cessors, would live long enough to finish the work." 
On the whole, the volumes thus far are so much 
fairer, more accurate, and more comprehensive than 
any former presentation of British naval history 
. that only critics of the captious sort will fail to be 
truly grateful for them. The numerous illustrations 
are well selected and handsomely executed, and 
there is an index to each volume. 



Story of 
the Union 
of Italy. 



Mr. W. J. Stillman, since his retire- 
ment from active service as Italian 
correspondent of the London 
" Times," has engaged himself busily in certain 
long-projected literary undertakings. One of these 
the preparation of his memoirs will doubtless 
result in a book of the most readable sort, a book the 
appearance of which we anticipate with much pleas- 
ure. Meanwhile, Mr. Stillman has already com- 
pleted another task which he was peculiarly well- 
fitted to perform, and tells us, in a new volume of 
the " Cambridge Historical Series," the thrilling 
story of " The Union of Italy " (Macmillan). Hav- 
ing made this statement, we hasten to qualify two 
of the words which it contains. Mr. Stillman is 
certainly well-fitted to write of the Risorgimento, 
but prejudice and the disillusionment of advancing 
years have conspired to impair his powers of judg- 
ment ; the story itself is certainly thrilling, but Mr. 
Stillman's narrative is so matter-of-fact that it 
would hardly help anyone unacquainted with the 
great action which it chronicles to understand the 
Italian poems of Mrs. Browning and Mr. Swinburne. 
Still, we are much indebted to the author for what 
he has done. He was a close observer of at least 
the later phases of the revolutionary movement, in 
which he himself all but participated, and he has 
had a wide acquaintance with the men who were 
conspicuous in that movement. Admiration for 
Cavour has unfortunately had upon him the effect 
that it has had upon some other historians of the 
period : it has made him grossly unfair to Mazzini, 
unfair mainly in the negative way of saying little 
about him, but occasionally unfair in the more un- 
pleasant ways of innuendo and contemptuous char- 
acterization. That the Union of Italy was far more 
the work of Mazzini than of Cavour is a proposition 
that we hold to be beyond question, and no history 
of that achievement in which Mazzini does not ap- 
pear as the central figure can be more than a his- 
tory of its externals. 

Professor Harry Thurston Peck has 
done much for classical scholarship, 
and at the same time has shown a 
breadth of culture and a versatility of mind very 
commendable in this day of intense specialization. 
His latest production in the shape of a book at 
least is a translation of Petronius into very ver- 
nacular English (Dodd, Mead & Co.), with a con- 
siderable amount of editorial accompaniment. In 



" Trimalchio's 
Sinner." 



his introduction, the editor has sketched briefly the 
history of prose fiction in Greece and Rome. Prose 
fiction, as opposed to theological myth, derives from 
the beast fable, which is purely oriental in its origin. 
The romance, historical and of adventure, the novel 
of character, the novel of pastoral life, all find their 
beginnings here. Lost to Western Europe in the 
Dark Ages, these tales, blended with the traditions 
of the Teutonic peoples, found their way into the 
" Gesta Romanorum," that "perfect mirage of odds 
and ends," the connecting link between the fiction of 
classic times and the fiction of to-day. Following 
this, we have a brief characterization of Petronius, 
a history of the " Satira," and a word of criticism, 
or rather encomium, which closes with this dictum : 
" To seek a fitting parallel for his strangely brilliant 
fiction, we must pass over the intervening centuries 
and find it only in our own century and in the lit- 
erary art of modern France." As a third feature 
of the introduction, Professor Peck gives us a note 
of presentation to Trimalchio himself, with a hint 
of the riches in store for us. This very fittingly 
leads to the dinner itself, where we have game made 
out of pork, and peacock eggs cut from pastry. The 
extravagant luxury of the table is typical of an age 
when wealth came easily and the appetites were 
men's gods. " Trimalchio's Dinner " is valuable as 
a picture of the life of the Roman bourgeoisie. In 
Trimalchio himself, we have the Roman freedman 
who has accrued vast wealth suddenly. Proud of 
his estates, well-meaning, generous to a fault, boast- 
ful of his libraries in Greek and Latin, ignorant of 
the very forms of his own tongue, he is a veritable 
snob. To the scholar, the original, in the many little 
details of life, is of archaeological value; and the 
text offers much of linguistic interest to the gen- 
eral reader as well. The book closes with a valu- 
able bibliography of the primitive forms of fiction, 
of Greek and Roman fiction, of Roman life in the 
time of Petronius, of the text and translations. The 
translation is well done, and the rollicking humor 
of the original is sustained throughout. The Latin 
slang finds equivalents in English which are cer- 
tainly effective, although at times rather startling. 
The illustrations are very helpful, and the entire 
make-up of the book is commendable.

(Macmillan) would require a mono- 
graph in itself if the points of interest to the eager 
historical student were to be adequately noted and 
commented upon. The work is an authoritative 
narrative, in two large volumes, of the history of 
England from 55 B. C. to 1154 A. D. It is author- 
itative in the sense that not a fact is given nor an 
opinion expressed for which the writer does not cite 
volume and page of the book or document from 
which he has drawn his material. The style is in 
no way remarkable, nor is there any novelty of 
method to attract the reader of history who looks 
for striking characterizations; but for reference

purposes, for convenience to the student in discov- 
ering quickly what the best scholarship has deter- 
mined in regard to the institutions of any particular 
period, the work is simply invaluable. It will he 
a standard work of reference in every college library 
in the country. A point of somewhat unusual inter- 
est is the location fixed upon for the battle of Mons 
Grampius, or Groupius, as the author prefers to call 
it. The view taken is that in the year 84 A. D. 
Agricola advanced from Ardoch to Perth, from 
Perth to Coupar Angus, and from Coupar Angus 
to Delvine, situated on the north bank of the river 
Tay some thirty-five miles northeast of Stirling. 
This site agrees perfectly with the details of the 
battle as given by Tacitus, and explains the neces- 
sity for the curious cavalry manoeuvre which decided 
the day in favor of the Roman army. The jutting 
promontory of the Redgale Braes made it impossi- 
ble for the Roman cavalry, after its first charge on 
the Caledonian left, to wheel round the rear of the 
enemy's position, and compelled it to pass back of 
the Roman infantry in order to make the final and 
decisive charge against the right. Two excellent 
maps accompany the description of this battle. 

c A. Dana's The war articles Dv Charles A. Dana, 
Recollections of recently published in one of the mag- 
the Civil war. az i ne8 , have been gathered into a 
comely volume entitled " Recollections of the Civil 
War" (Appleton). When read as a whole they 
prove to be fascinating in the pungency of the style 
and the clear directness of the story-telling. The 
book is also important as a contribution to the his- 
tory of the time, for the author's official position took 
him into the heart of things, and he has secured the 
accuracy which is apt to be wanting in reminiscences, 
by reference to his almost daily reports of what he 
saw and heard. Mr. Dana joined Grant's army in 
March, 1863, commissioned to act as representative 
in the field for the Secretary of War, and to report 
everything that should be of interest to the govern- 
ment at Washington. He was with the armies 
through the whole Vicksburg campaign, through the 
Chattanooga campaign from September to Decem- 
ber, and through the Wilderness campaign of 1864. 
During the intervals between these campaigns, and 
during the last year of the war, he was in service 
in the War Department at Washington, in intimate 
relations with the leading men, especially President 
Lincoln and Secretary Stanton. The mere state- 
ment of these opportunities will show what the book 
must be, written by a journalistic genius like Mr. 
Dana. Its interest is all the greater from the ab- 
sence of any formal narrative of the author's ser- 
vice and adventures. He passes over the details, 
giving striking incidents, brief character sketches, 
interesting anecdotes, and vivid descriptions of such 
events as the battles of Chickamauga and Chat- 
tanooga, and Grant's death-grapple with Lee in the 
Wilderness. His chapter on Lincoln and his Cab- 
inet is one of the most satisfactory studies of the 
great War President yet put into print, while nearly 



the whole book is an indirect study of Stanton and 
Grant. The book is one of the most readable, as 
well as authentic, of those pertaining to the Civil 
War. 

Newly discovered lt is a curious feeling with which one 
early poems takes up the " all but facsimile re- 

of SMiey. print) j ust published by Mr. John 

Lane, of the " Original Poetry by Victor & Cazire." 
Forty years ago Dr. Richard Garnett discovered, in 
a rare periodical named " Stockdale's Budget," that 
a volume with the above title had been published by 
Shelley in 1810, and that subsequently, after a few 
copies had gone into circulation, the youthful poet 
had destroyed the greater part of the edition. For 
these forty years the possibility of unearthing one of 
the few copies that escaped destruction had hovered, 
as an elusive dream, over the fancies of Shelleians 
in particular and bibliophiles in general. At last a 
copy came to light, bound up with other pamphlets 
in a book that had come down from the library of 
the Rev. C. H. Grove, a brother of the Harriet 
Grove to whom many of the poems were addressed. 
To Dr. Garnett appropriately fell the task of editing 
a reprint of this unique copy, and the result is now 
before us, enriched by an editorial preface. These 
pieces, written at the age of eighteen, add nothing 
to Shelley's poetical reputation, and indeed the most 
striking thing about them is the way in which they 
illustrate the fact that a great poet may begin his 
career in the most unpromising way. But they add 
a necessary chapter to the poet's life, and it is a 
great satisfaction to have discovered what seemed 
so hopelessly lost. We have read a certain amount 
of carping comment upon this republication, to the 
general effect that it does no honor to the poet's 
memory ; but this seems to us curiously beside the 
point. Dr. Garnett puts the matter in a nutshell 
when he says of the question whether the book 
should have been reprinted, that " the question ap- 
pears pertinent, but only to the uninitiated." It 
certainly does not appear pertinent to us, and we 
shall not discuss it.

a manual of etiquette and social usage, aiding those

ica it points out the marked differences between that 
European army which is most like our own, and the 
small but useful body of our fellow-citizens which 
many Americans vaguely dread under the title of 
" a standing army." Nothing but such a book as 
this, written by " A British Officer," and illustrated 
by Mr. R. Caton Woodville from drawings made 
on the spot, could accent these differences, and ac- 
cent them in a manner which leaves us better satis- 
fied with our own military establishment. We learn 
that a man must have an independent income of 
no mean size if he is to hold his own in one of the

stable for official duties in the cavalry comprising 
also a number of polo ponies and racing horses, 
with an occasional hunter, the original outlay run- 
ning up into several thousands of dollars or their 
British equivalents. Though England maintains 
several military academies of the highest efficiency, 
many of her officers pass through the hands of a 
military " coach," and, by undergoing a somewhat 
severe examination, enter as commissioned officers 
directly from civilian life. To obtain a commission 
in the most desirable regiments, ascertained wealth 
and social position are essentials ; and the traditions 
of the corps take the place of the American's edu- 
cation at West Point in maintaining the reputation 
of the army. It is evident that much can be said 
in argument between systems so diverse. The book 
is interestingly written, and replete with detail. 



Modern 
German, 
culture. 



The man of culture of the present 
day as distinguished from the 
scholar, the scientist, the philosopher 
on the one hand, and the artist or the amateur on 
the other probably owes more to contemporary 
France than to contemporary Germany. He has 
more of it in him. Certainly taking the whole 
century, French literature and French painting have 
been more stimulating than German ; French pol- 
itics and French life have been on the whole inter- 
esting to more people than German. We think 
this is so in America, in spite of the large German 
element with us; in spite of the number of our 
own people, students and artists, who have worked 
in Germany ; in spite of the influence of German 
music and musicians, of German philosophy and 
German scholarship. You will find a dozen who 
read a French novel to one who reads a German 
novel, a dozen plays from the French to half a 
dozen from the German, a dozen travellers familiar 
with Paris to one who knows Berlin. But it is this 
very thing, to our mind, that gives a particular value 
to Professor Kuno Francke's "Glimpses of Mod- 
ern German Culture " (Dodd). It is a book which 
may serve to open the way to a great many who are 
now unaware how wonderfully rich is Germany to- 
day in books, pictures, music, political ideas, in 
things which when once known are as keenly inter- 
esting to the cultivated mind as anything that can 
be found in France. Without going into compari- 
sons, a lover of French painting and poetry may 
find something new and worth while in the pictures 
of Boecklin and Thoma, in the poems of Johanna 
Ambrosius and Gustav Falke. And if anyone 
insists on comparing, we may say that there are no 
French dramatists superior to Hauptmann and 
Sudermann (Mr. Francke would probably add Wil- 
denbruch, but we should not), no political forces 
in France more interesting than Bismarck and the 
Social Demokratie. As to music and scholarship, 
nothing need be said except just to mention them 
in filling out the idea of what is included in the 
phrase " Modern German Culture." So far as de- 
tails are concerned, we differ here and there from 



Orowth and 
curiosities of 
South London. 



Mr. Francke : as to " The Sunken Bell," for in- 
stance, we hesitate to agree entirely, as to Bismarck 
we are very doubtful, as to Wildenbruch we heartily 
disagree. There are naturally differences of opin- 
ion in such things : Mr. Francke probably would 
have more to say for his views than appears here, 
had he the occasion. In these essays he had to say 
his say in small compass, for the papers are rather 
short, many of them having been articles in " The 
Nation " and other periodicals. We have been 
somewhat exercised of late over breakfast-books. 
If a man breakfasts alone, has a little time over his 
breakfast and does not read the daily paper just 
then, he will hardly find a better moment in the 
day for a little reading. But of course it is not 
every book that will do : one must select pretty 
carefully. We rather think that Mr. Francke's 
book would be a pleasant breakfast companion for 
a fortnight : the essays are short and suggestive. 
Afterwards one may go back to Gibbon's " Mem- 
oirs," or Lander's "Conversations," or any other 
old stand-by. 

Sir Walter Besant has taken a nota- 
ble interest in the history of what is 
now London. He has already writ- 
ten two volumes on London and Westminster, de- 
scriptive of the origin and growth of those ancient 
places, with their part in the modern London. He 
now offers a volume on " South London " (Stokes). 
It is not strictly a history, but a series of seventeen 
chapters selected out of a vast mass of material on 
the subject. He begins with South wark marsh, and 
takes up the growth of the place, the customs of the 
people, numerous tragical and humorous incidents 
in the life of those clashing times, and the growth 
in the political ideas of his forefathers. This is 
all done in the pleasing and graceful style of Mr. 
Besant. The vividness and reality of the scenes 
described are heightened by a great number of 
choice illustrations, a result of the skill of Mr. Percy 
Wadham. Londoners, and Londoners' descendants, 
will find in this luxurious volume ample fascination 
for several hours of very pleasurable reading.

os the sciences. Mivart discusses the common foun- 
dation of all the sciences and the relationships exist- 
ing between them. Epistemology is the science of 
the sciences. After an enumeration of the sciences, 
notable for some very proper omissions, his specific 
topics are the objects and the methods of science ; 
the physical, psychical, and intellectual antecedents 
of science ; the relation of science to language ; the 
causes of science, and the nature of its groundwork. 
The work is timely and is eminently suggestive. It 
is itself an example of the clearness of thought and 
of diction which should characterize all scientific 
discussions. From the conclusion we quote, as a 
fitting dominant chord : " The action of an all- 
pervading but unimaginable intelligence alone 
affords us any satisfactory conception of the uni-

cosmos which may he selected for exclusive study." 
A work of somewhat similar purpose, issued by 
the same publishers, is " The Sphere of Science," by 
Professor Hoffman of Union College. After open- 
ing his subject by a method not widely different 
from that used by Dr. Mivart, Dr. Hoffman gives 
less attention to the purely metaphysical construc- 
tion of an ideal edifice in which the various sciences 
shall appear in their true and intimate relationships, 
and more to the share which each has in the devel- 
opment of human knowledge in its present stage of 
forwardness. Particular interest attaches to the 
author's discussions of the limitations of science, 
and his resum6 of the recent progress made in vari- 
ous directions. The works of Dr. Mivart and Dr. 
Hoffman are in a large degree complementary, and 
may well be read together.

Historic 



England history is an appar- 
ently exhaustless fountain. However 
New England. muc h may be studied, some new 
phase continually presents itself for examination, 
and the apparently trivial things of daily life in the 
olden time may be so described as to make enter- 
taining and profitable reading. " Historic Pilgrim- 
ages in New England " (Silver, Burdett & Co.) is 
one of a rapidly increasing class of books given to 
details of the homes and the customs of Americans. 
The familiar plan of answering the questions of a 
bright young companion is adopted, and much that 
is valuable information is thus set forth. There are 
many illustrations, some of them uncommon, some 
very familiar ; and the book will serve to while away 
more than one hour with the fathers of New England.

great deal of romance, which culminated, perhaps, 
in the death of the leader of the expedition and his

the preparation of which Miss Graqe King has 
shown the same skill she manifested in "New Or- 
leans " and in that story of Bienville which finds 
place in the " Makers of America " series. It is 
not too difficult for the pleasure and profit of youth, 
nor is it so simple in narration as to fail to attract 
the special student of American history. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Harper's Scientific Memoirs " is the name given to 
a new series of small books which aim to publish, in 
careful English translations, what may be called the 
original documents of science. Professor Joseph S. 
Ames is to be the general editor of the series. The 
following two volumes have appeared: " The Free Ex- 
pansion of Gases " and " Prismatic and Diffraction 
Spectra." The former comprises papers by Gay-Lussac, 
Joule, and Thomson; the latter the classical papers of 
Joseph Fraunhofer. A few of the titles promised for 
early publication are: "Rontgen Rays," "Solutions," 
" Properties of Ions," and " The Wave Theory of Light." 

" The Shifting and Incidence of Taxation " (Macmil- 
lan), by Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman, has just passed 
into a second edition, which has given the author an oppor- 
tunity to subject the work to a thoroughgoing revision. 
It is so changed, both in its historical and positive parts, 
as to be practically a new volume. Among the altera- 
tions may be noted the fuller treatment of the early 
English literature of the subject, the addition of a chap- 
ter on the physiocrats, the rewriting of the chapter on 
the mathematical theory, the closer study of import 
duties and stamp taxes, and the added index and bibli- 
ography. The work is thus made far more valuable 
than before, and a still greater credit to American 
scholarship in this difficult field. 

" Bible Stories " is the title of a supplementary vol- 
ume of " The Modern Reader's Bible " (Macmillan) . 
Like the rest of the series to which it belongs, this vol- 
ume is prepared by Mr. Richard G. Moulton. It is 
announced as a " children's number " of the series, and 
contains stories from the Old Testament only. A sim- 
ilar volume of New Testament stories is in course 
of preparation. A much bigger book which deserves 
mention in the same connection is Mrs. Harriet S. B. 
Beale's " Stories from the Old Testament for Children " 
(Stone). Here the stories are frankly retold in simple 
language, as in Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare," 
whereas Mr. Moulton's volume does not depart (except 
for omissions) from the revised scriptural text. 

" The Arte or Crafte of Rhethoryke," by Leonard 
Cox, who was a preacher and schoolmaster in the reigns 
of Henry VIII. and Edward VI., is the first text-book 
of rhetoric in the English language. The date of its 
first edition is uncertain, but it cannot have been far 
from 1530. It is now reprinted under the editorship 
of Dr. Frederic Ives Carpenter, with notes and a learned 
introduction, and appears as a highly acceptable addition 
to the series of " English Studies " published under the 
auspices of the University of Chicago.

LITERARY NOTES. 



The Macmillan Co. publish a volume of selections 
from Pope's " Iliad," edited by Mr. Albert H. Smyth 
for school use. 

Miss Beatrice Harraden, it is reported, will soon make 
a second visit to the United States, with California for 
her objective point. 

" Der Letzte," a story by Herr von Wildenbruch, 
edited by Dr. F. G. G. Schmidt, is published by Messrs. 
D. C. Heath & Co. 

Mr. William Dudley Foulke's " Slav or Saxon " (Put- 
nam), already twelve years old, now appears in a revised 
edition. It is one of the " Questions of the Day," just 
as before. 

A selection of " Scenes de Voyages de Victor Hugo " 
(Holt), edited by Mr. Thomas Bertrand Bronson, makes 
a very attractive little volume for school use. The ex- 
tracts are from " Le Rhin." 

" The Story of the Cotton Plant," by Mr. F. Wilkin- 
son, is the latest addition to " The Library of Useful 
Stories," published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co., and 
already numbering more than a dozen neat volumes. 

The series of articles on " Successful Houses," which 
have been appearing for some time in the pages of 
" The House Beautiful," are now published in a hand- 
somely-illustrated volume by Messrs. Herbert S. Stone 
& Co. 

The first monthly number of " A Kipling Note Book," 
devoted to " illustrations, anecdotes, bibliographical and 
biographical facts anent this foremost writer of fic- 
tion," is published by Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & A. 
Wessels. 

Lessing's " Minna von Barnhelm," edited by Mr. 
A. B. Nichols, is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & 
Co., and has the unusual feature (for a school book) of 
a series of twelve illustrations from the etchings by 
Chodowiecki. 

"Our Nation's Peril: Social Ideals and Social Pro- 
gress " is the title of a pamphlet by Dr. Lewis G. Janes, 
just published by Messrs. James H. West & Co. It is 
a scholarly and philosophical protest against the pre- 
vailing spirit of imperialism. 

A new novel by Count Tolstoy is to be published in 
May. English readers will be more fortunate than 
Russian, for they will get the complete work, whereas 
it is reported that the Russian censor will reduce it 
by one-third for home consumption. 

Hereafter there is to be a special American edition 
of " The Statesman's Year Book." The section upon 
the United States will be greatly enlarged, thereby 
making what has always been an indispensable work of 
reference even more indispensable than before. Mr. 
Carroll D. Wright will be the American editor and the 
Macmillan Co. the publishers. 

In emulation of the plays of the " Hasty Pudding 
Club " at Harvard and the " Students' Opera Company " 
at Columbia, the students of the University of Chicago 
will present a musical comedy entitled " The Deceitful 
Dean," on the evening of March 10, at the University 
Gymnasium. The play has been written by local Uni- 
versity talent, and the parts will be taken by fifty 
persons. 

The " Bulletin of the New York State Museum " for 
last November (a government publication) is " A Guide 
to the Study of the Geological Collections of the New 



York State Museum," prepared by Dr. Frederick J. H. 
Merrill. It is a very valuable work for students and 
teachers of geology, having over one hundred full- 
page photographic plates. To put it within the reach 
of schools, it is supplied at the merely nominal price of 
forty cents. In sending out this publication for review, 
there goes with it the following note, which is so sug- 
gestive of what other States might do that it deserves 
reproduction: "The present director and his associates 
are without exception warmly interested in securing a 
more active cooperation of the Museum and its staff 
with the teachers of science in the colleges and schools 
of the State, which the peculiar circumstances of the 
Museum have heretofore made impracticable, and will 
be very glad of suggestions from teachers in any insti- 
tution in the University. Science teachers ought to 
feel some measure of responsibility for notifying the 
Museum of matters of interest in their locality and act- 
ing as associate or honorary members of the Museum 
staff, the scientific officers of which will in turn be glad, 
as far as practicable, to visit schools where their ser- 
vices are requested, and give advice and suggestions 
regarding collections, field work, and other matters of 
interest."

THE PLAN OF ORGANIZATION 

EMBRACES 

1. The Technical College, an engineering school 
of high grade, having thorough courses in 

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, 
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, 
ARCHITECTURE, and 

MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS. 

These courses are each four years in length. There 
is also a two years' course in Architecture. 

2. Armour Scientific Academy, a thorough-going 
preparatory school, which fits its students for ad- 
mission to the engineering courses of the Technical

THE VICTORIAN ERA SERIES 

The series is designed to form a record of the great movements and developments of the 
age, in politics, economics, religion, industry, literature, science, and art, and of the life-work 
of its typical and influential men. 

Under the general editorship of Mr. J. Holland Rose, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, 
Cambridge, England, the individual volumes will be contributed by leading specialists in the 
various branches of knowledge which fall to be treated in the series. 

The volumes will be handsomely bound in cloth, with good paper and large type, suitable 
for the library. Price, $1.25 per volume. 

NOW READY 

THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY 

By J. HOLLAND ROSE, M.A., late scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge (editor of the series). 

An interesting historical account of British Radicalism of the first half of the century fills a large part of the 
volume. . . . On the whole, we are able to praise the volume as a moderate and impartial view of the demo- 
cratization of the Constitution Athenaeum. 

In dealing with his subject Mr. Rose displays considerable independence of thought, joined to accuracy of 
detail and clearness of exposition. His style, too, is vigorous; and on the whole he has made a good start for 
what promises to be a useful and instructive series Glasgow Herald. 

If the remaining volumes of the " Victorian Era Series " are written in as able, temperate, and judicious a 
spirit as the first, "The Rise of Democracy," by J. H. Rose, M.A., we anticipate for it a great and deserved 
success. Manchester Guardian. 

For all who wish to get an unbiased view of the Radical movement in England during the present century 
its benefits, its faults, and its limitations this little book can be unhesitatingly recommended. Aberdeen Journal. 

| THE ANGLICAN REVIVAL ) I 

By J. H. OVERTON, D.D., Rector of Epworth and Canon of Lincoln. 

We can highly recommend this able history of Canon Overton's, and we hope it may clear the minds of 
many as to the history of " The Anglican Revival." It is by no means a party or an extreme statement of facts, 
but rather a judicial record of the religious events that have moulded " The Anglican Revival " in the Church of 
England during the reign of Queen Victoria. Church Review. 

Dr. Overton's contribution to this series of handy books is a volume that is well worth reading by men and 
women who care to know just where the Established Church is now, and what are its tendencies Norwich 
Mercury. 

The author . . . writes without bias and with the true spirit of the historian only anxious to secure his 
facts and to " nothing extenuate nor aught set down in malice." Weekly Echo. 

Of the movement itself, and its main actors, Canon Overton gives an excellent account. He has the literature 
of the subject at his fingers' ends, and the story could not be better told. Sheffield Telegraph. 

1 ~ JOHN BRIGHT . t 

By C. A. VINCE, M.A., late Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. 

We have every reason to regard this as the sanest, most impartial, and intelligent life of John Bright that 
has been given to the public. Birmingham Gazette. 

Mr. Vince has had the good sense to allow John Bright, as far as possible, to speak for himself, and he has 
shown great discrimination in the selection of pithy typical passages from memorable speeches at critical junctures 
in the Queen's reign. Speaker. 

An excellent little life of Bright, with a chapter on Bright's oratory which is admirable and most remarkable. 
It constitutes a brief but careful examination of the characteristics which made Bright the first orator of our 
time, and appears to us the best examination of the peculiarities of modern English oratory extant. Athenceum. 

This little book seems to us, in its way, a remarkable success. It is a model of what such a sketch should be 
sober, well-written, with the matter well-ordered, and throughout a tone of judicial care not unmixed with 
enthusiasm. Academy. 

Mr. Vince's biography of Bright is a model of its kind. It gives us an admirable picture of the man whom 
Lord Salisbury rightly characterized as the greatest master of English oratory that recent generations have seen.

Bird Gods. By Charles DeKay. 

With Decorations by GEORGE WHARTON EDWARDS. 
One volume, 12mo, cloth, gilt top, pages xxiv.+249 
=273. Price, $2.00. 

" In Mr. DeKay's book the germ is found in the religious association 
that originally attached to some bird which had been invested with di- 
vine attributes. It was a field that lay open to an enthusiastic explor- 
er, and has been well worked by the author. Every page is stored with 
the results of wide research, but the arrajr of facts never becomes tedi- 
ous, for they have been thoroughly assimilated and set forth with a 
simplicity that makes the reading easy and enjoyable, while affording a 
clear and reasonable thread of thought to guide the reader through this 
grotesque jungle of old beliefs. On the other hand, the author has not 
insisted unduly upon his conclusions ; he is often satisfied to leave them 
in the form of suggestions. Mr. Edwards has co-operated admirably. 
A 'decorated,' as distinguished from an illustrated, book, is compara- 
tively rare nowadays and a welcome revision to old methods. The de- 
signs are excellent full of freshness of invention and vigor of concep- 
tion : in complete harmony with the spirit of the text, and executed 
with a technique that is individual and thoroughly interesting. They 
may be quoted as among the best modern examples of beautiful and 
eloquent line-work." Literature.

MODERN PLAYS. 

EDITED BY 
R. BRIMLEY JOHNSON and N. ERICHSEN. 

It is the aim of this series to represent, as widely as 
possible, the activity of the modern drama not con- 
fined to stage performance in England and through- 
out the continent of Europe. It so happens that 
though translations seem to be more in demand every 
day, the greater number of Continental dramatists are 
at present little known in this country. Among them 
will be found predecessors and followers of Ibsen or 
Maeterlinck, as well as others who reflect more inde- 
pendently the genius of their own country. 

The work of translation has been intrusted to writers 
specially conversant with the literatures represented, 
who, in many cases, are already associated in the pub- 
lic mind with the authors they are here interpreting. 
Every play is translated in extenso, and, if in verse, as 
nearly as possible in the original metres. The volumes 
contain brief introductions, bibliographical and explana- 
tory rather than critical, and such annotations as are 
necessary. 

The volumes are printed in small quarto, and bound 
in decorated cloth covers, and with gilt tops. Price, 
each, $1.25 net. 

The following are now ready : 

THE DAWN. 



By EMILE VERHAEREN. 

SYMONS. 



Translated by ARTHUR 



Deserves a welcome from the world of letters, for it introduces a series 
which has long been wanted, and which is bound to be of great interest. 
" The Dawn " is interesting, suggestive, original in style and aim. 

The Academy. 

Mr. Symons's version is astonishingly good in portions. Some of the 
greater passages are rendered with a vigor, a subtlety, and an insight 
that reminds one how strong is the poetic force of the translator. 

The Bookman. 

THE STORM. 

By OSTROVSKY. Translated by CONSTANCE 
GARNETT. 

The work of translation has "been admirably done, and reproduces 
with excellent effect the strength and simplicity which are the charac 
teristic qualities of the style of the original. The work itself is a fine 
play. The Scotsman. 

A wonderful analysis of a provincial society untouched by the ideas 
of civilized Europe. No book of Tolstoi's makes you feel Russia so 
distinctly. " The Storm " is at once a satire, a drama, and a poem ; 
and one is not surprised to hear of its success on the Russian stage. 

The Critic (London). 

THREE PLAYS. 

Alladine and Palomides, Interior, and 
The Death of Tintagiles. 

By MAURICE MAETERLINCK. Translated by 
ALFRED SUTRO and WILLIAM ARCHER. 

In active preparation, volumes by Villiers De L'Isle 
Adam, Strindberg, Ibsen, Brieux, and Sienkiewicz, trans- 
lated respectively by Theresa Barclay, N. Erichsen, 
Prof. C. H. Herford, Lucas Malet, and E. L. Voynich. 

Arrangements are also in progress with representa- 
tive dramatists of Germany, Spain, Italy, and other 
countries. Further translations have been promised by 
Dr. Garnett, Walter Leaf, Justin H. McCarthy, G. A. 
Greene, and others.

A NEW BOOK BY SIR GEORGE TREVELYAN. 

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, 1766=1776. 

By Sir GEORGE OTTO TREVELYAN, Bart., 

Author of " The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay," and " The Early History of Charles James Fox." 
8vo. Pp. xiv.-434. With a Map of Boston. Cloth, gilt top, $3.00. 

"Those brilliant qualities of style which were so preeminent in the author's 'The Life and Letters of Lord Maeaulay ' 
and ' Early History of Charles James Fox ' are distinguishable in ' The American Revolution.' Rare indeed is the book 
wherein it may be stated that there is no line which has not its particular interest. In reading Sir George, attention never 
wanders, for he has all the talents of the ablest of story-tellers, and that is precisely the quality many historians lack. We 
are positive that this volume will be sought for, read, and commented on by readers all over the United States." Times (N. Y.) 



Under the African Sun. 

A Description of Native Races in Uganda 
Sporting Adventures and Other Experiences 

By W. J. ANSORGE, M.A., LL.D., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., 
Medical Officer to Her Majesty's Government in 
Uganda. With 134 illustrations from photographs 
by the author, and two colored plates. Large 8vo, 
pp. xiv.-355, $5.00. Just ready. 

*#* Dr. Ansorge, medical officer to the British Government 
in Uganda, has written a very graphic and accurate account 
of that country before the establishment of the Protectorate. 
The relentless side of civilization is rapidly sweeping away 
many phases of native life worth recording, and with the 
shriek of the locomotive the picturesque and barbarous must 
certainly disappear. Dr. Ansorge, whose work gave him 
many opportunities of observing savage ritual, custom, and 
myth unrevealed, may be, to men of other professions is 
also a keen sportsman and an accomplished naturalist, and in 
the last chapters of his book he describes the physical features 
of the country, giving an account of some new species of lep- 
idoptera which he discovered. The illustrations, from photo- 
graphs by the author, form a special feature of the work. 
There are no fewer than 16 full-page plates, 117 text illustra- 
tions, and two colored plates, these last being illustrative of 
the natural-history section of the book. 

England in the Age of Wycliffe. 

By GEORGE MACAULAY TREVELYAN, B.A., Fellow of 
Trinity College, Cambridge. 8vo. Nearly ready. 
*#* The object of this volume is to give a general picture 
of English society, politics and religion, at a certain stage in 
their progress. It recounts also the leading and characteristic 
events of the same period in English history . . . the meet- 
ing point of the mediaeval and the modern, and so of pecu- 
liar|interest. Mr. Trevelyan bases his work on original au- 
thorities, many of which have now been unearthed for the 
first time in the Public Record Office and the British Museum.

The Companions of Pickle. 

Being a Sequel to "Pickle the Spy." By ANDREW 
LANG. With 4 photogravure portraits. 8vo, pp. 
xii.-308, $5.00. 

*** Certain criticisms on the theory that " Pickle the Spy'" 
was Glengarry induced the author to look further into the 
Jacobite documents at Windsor Castle and elsewhere. The 
result is this volume on " The Companions of Pickle," a set 
of eighteenth-century portraits. Among these is a biography, 
from MS. and other sources, of the last Earl Marischal, brother 
of Field-Marshall Keith, and friend of Frederick the Great.

In the Introduction the author devotes a few pages to ex- 
amine how far the experience of the last eventful years has 
confirmed or disproved the general principles it laid down. 
"But the chief interest of this Introduction lies in its epi- 
logue . . . Mr. Lecky . . . devotes 30 out of the 52 pages the 
Introduction contains to an estimate of the character and 
political work of Mr. Gladstone. . . . Eminently judicial in 
tone, written evidently with considerable personal knowledge, 
masterly in its analysis of character, and often singularly

Dial : "A fitting memorial to its author. . . . The breadth of his experience, as well as the natural range of his mind, are 
here reflected. The subjects dealt with are all live and practical. ... He never deals with them in a narrow or so-called 
'practical' way."

New York Evening Post : " He has a taking subject for historical criticism . . . the diverse effects of that mighty event

STACPOOLE'S THE RAPIN. A Novel. I2mo. $1.25. 

Rapin is Parisian studio slang for a professed student of art who has neither the talent nor energy to succeed. There were excep- 
tional reasons to make this Rapin more interesting than Rapins in general. The story is, on the part of one of the chief actors, an 
idyll ; on the part of the other something else. The characters range from the Bohemians of the Latin Quarter to the nobles of the 
Faubourg and the Elysees, are all bold types, and drawn with exquisite clearness and finish. The book is a great advance on the 
author's "Pierrot," and justifies the confident prognostications which the earlier work elicited from the critics.

HARPER'S SPRING BOOKS 

THE LETTERS OF ROBERT BROWNING AND ELIZABETH 

BARRETT BARRETT, 1845 - 1846. Illustrated with Two Contemporary 
Portraits of the Writers, and Two Facsimile Letters. With a Prefatory Note by R. BARRETT 
BROWNING, and Notes by F. G. KENTON, Explanatory of the Greek Words. Two Volumes. 
Crown 8vo, Cloth, Deckle Edges and Gilt Tops. $5.00. 

This remarkable collection, in all probability the most important contribution to letters published in the 
last decade, must appeal to every reader of the Brownings' poems more strongly than could any other book. 
It comprises every letter that passed between the two poets from their first acquaintance until their marriage, 
with the exception of one which was destroyed by common consent. 

THE MARTYRDOM OF AN EMPRESS. Illustrated. Crown 8vo, Cloth, Deckle 

Edges and Gilt Top. $2.50. 

Elizabeth, Empress of Austria, is one of the most picturesque and at the same time one of the most com- 
pletely misunderstood figures in modern European history. This book is the story of her life, written not 
from the outside by a mere collector of records, but by a lady of her court, who was an intimate personal friend. 

THE JACKSONIAN EPOCH. By CHARLES H. PECK. 8vo, Cloth, Uncut Edges and 

Gilt Top. $2.50. 

A remarkably strong presentation of the political history of our country from the battle of New Orleans to 
the succession of Mr. Tyler to the Presidency. That was the formative period of our politics, and nowhere 
else can the history of this epoch be found in a single work. 

WESSEX POEMS AND OTHER VERSES. By THOMAS HARDY. With Thirty- 
two Illustrations by the Author. Crown 8vo, Cloth Extra, Uncut Edges and Gilt Top. $1.75. 

THE OPEN QUESTION. A Tale of Two Temperaments. By ELIZABETH ROBINS

RAGGED LADY. By WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS. A Novel. Illustrated by A. I. KELLER. 

Post 8vo, Cloth. $1.75. 

Mr. Howells has always been a trained observer of human life. He sees everything clearly, and has the 
power of making his readers see just as clearly. His powers of observation, his keen reading of human 
motives, and his ability to delineate his observations concisely and accurately have never been shown to better 
advantage than in his latest contribution to American fiction. 

THE "CAPSINA." A Historical Novel. By E. F. BENSON. 374 Pages. Post 8 vo, Cloth, 

Ornamental. 

The stirring times which took place in Greece during the Greek War of Independence, in 1820-1821, are 
pictured in a graphic and vital way by Mr. Benson. The book will hold the reader's attention by its action 
and the remarkable vitality which characterizes all of Mr. Benson's works.

AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER. 

In our last issue, occasion was had to say 
something of "the literary life " as seen through 
the colored spectacles of Sir Walter Besant ; 
and it was hinted that the commercial aspects of 
authorship, as viewed by that doughty defender 
of the claims of literary property, might pro- 
vide us with another subject for discussion, 
drawn, like the former, from Sir Walter's recent 
volume, " The Pen and the Book." Since Mr. 
Kipling is happily on the road to recovery from 
his severe illness, and since no other matter of 
pressing importance just now looms above the 
bookman's horizon, we may as well as anything 
else take our own hint, and say a few words 
upon a subject that it is no longer possible, 
thanks to Sir Walter's activities, for a literary 
journal to ignore. Just six years ago, we took 
for a subject of editorial discussion the work 
done for men of letters by the English Society 
of Authors and its distinguished chairman, and 
were happy to pay our tribute of commendation 
to the helpfulness and thoroughgoing character 
of that work. Since then, both the Society and 
its quondam chairman have been pegging stead- 
ily away at their rather ungrateful task, and 
the persistence with which they have impressed 
upon the public the fundamental principles that 
should govern authors in their business rela- 
tions has had an easily appreciable effect, al- 
though the work of enlightenment is as yet by 
no means complete. 

That these missionary labors still have much 
to accomplish is evident, not merely from Sir 
Walter's regretful admission that, in spite of 
all that has been said upon the subject, "au- 
thors as a rule know nothing " about the busi- 
ness side of their profession, but particularly 
from the "draft agreements" issued last sum- 
mer by a representative committee of English 
publishers. This document was so amazing in 
its pretensions, so obviously grasping in its 
claims, that even those authors least inclined 
to be combative were startled out of their easy 
acquiescence in the existing order of relations 
between publishers and authors, and began to 
ask themselves if, after all, there might not be 
something worth their attention in this discus- 
sion about the conditions of publication which 



188 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



they had hitherto regarded as so much noisy 
and hollow clamor. The Society of Authors 
must have chuckled rather audibly at seeing 
the enemy thus play into their hands, for no 
publication of the Society itself had ever af- 
forded so powerful a support to its position as 
this unabashed statement of what the publish- 
ers claimed as fairly due to themselves. As 
Sir Walter says : 

" Whether these agreements are eventually with- 
drawn or modified, or not, they will remain as a proof 
that nothing that has been said as to the rapacity of 
publishers as a class comes anywhere near the truth, if 
this committee is representative. Every possible open- 
ing for a fresh claim is eagerly seized upon: all the 
charges and accounts, according to these agreements, 
are to be over-stated as a right: percentages of any- 
thing the publisher pleases are to be added: all sums 
of money received are to be treated as belonging to 
the publisher, less whatever royalties he may choose 
to give : all rights whatever are to be theirs : they 
even claim as their own the dramatic and translation 
rights!" 

Sir Walter's indictment against English 
publishers is thus sustained, as far as some of 
its counts are concerned, by the admission of 
the publishers themselves. His accusation is 
stated in the following general terms, which, 
we need hardly add, he fortifies by matters 
of actual fact that have come to his knowl- 
edge. 

" I have no hesitation whatever in alleging as a sim- 
ple fact that has been brought home to me by ten or 
twelve years of investigation into the commercial side 
of literature, that many publishers, including some of 
the great houses, have made it their common practice 
to take secret percentages on the cost of every item : 
to charge advertisements which they have not paid for : 
and in this manner to take from the proceeds of the 
book very much more than they were entitled to do by 
the agreement." 

Now these charges are very serious, and are 
not to be disposed of by calling people names. 
Whatever may be thought of Sir Walter's 
judgment and that seems to us not infre- 
quently at fault no one can seriously impugn 
his veracity, and we have no hesitation in ac- 
cepting anything which he reports as fact, 
whether it be the treatment of an author in 
some particular case, or the actual estimates 
given for cost of production, or the detailed 
statement of some " custom of the trade " 
which is used by publishers for the purpose of 
increasing their share of the profits at the ex- 
pense of the helpless writer of books. 

Few authors realize the number of distinct 
rights which they possess in their books. In 
the case of a novel, at least, there are no less 
than eight rights from which an English au- 



thor, if his vogue be considerable, may expect 
some gain. They are the English and Ameri- 
can serial rights, the English and American 
volume rights, the colonial and continental 
rights, and the rights of translation and dram- 
atization. If an author is not wary, he is 
warned that his publisher will slip into the 
contract some innocent appearing clause where- 
by some or all of these rights are transferred 
without their original possessor's fully realiz- 
ing what he is about. Certainly, an author 
should take expert advice in such a matter, just 
as he would take it in a realty transaction. The 
conveyancing of literary property, as of any 
other, calls for skill and special knowledge, 
which are not possessed by one man of letters 
in a dozen. 

The production of a book is a business en- 
terprise in which an author and a publisher 
are jointly interested, and the fundamental 
question of all is that of an equitable distribu- 
tion of whatever profits may result from the 
enterprise. We all know what publishers say 
when this question is raised. The burden of 
their plea is the risk that they perforce incur, 
the uncertainty of human affairs in general 
and of book-publishing in particular, the heavy 
miscellaneous expenses of their business, and 
the thousand and one cares of which they re- 
lieve the author. If they have acquired the 
art of saying these things suavely and impres- 
sively, they soon reduce the average author to 
a condition of mind in which he is disposed 
to accept gratefully, as so much unmerited 
largess, anything that may be offered him, and 
to depart from the interview with the feeling 
that publishers are the most benevolent of 
men. Now, there is something in all of these 
considerations ; there is more, for example, than 
Sir Walter is willing to allow. Nevertheless, 
he does the cause of letters good service by hold- 
ing a brief for the helpless author-plaintiff, and 
by subjecting the claims of the publisher-defend- 
ant to a closer scrutiny than his client is in a 
position to give them. There is a good deal of 
the bogy element in the average publisher's talk 
about risk. Publishers of experience usually 
know enough about their business to avoid tak- 
ing many real risks, although their pretended 
risks are numerous. If it is practically certain 
that a thousand copies of any book of the ordin- 
ary sort will find purchasers, there is no risk in 
its publication. The author may be allowed a 
ten per cent royalty, and enough will remain to 
make a fair profit for the publisher. Now, the 
large publishing houses do not accept many

THE DIAL

books for which this moderate sale is not a prac- 
tical certainty, and the profits of one reasonably 
successful book will make up for the loss 
incurred through a number of the occasional 
ventures that do not sell to the extent of even 
a thousand copies. As for the division of the 
profits, Sir Walter is of the opinion that one- 
third to the publisher and two-thirds to the 
author, after charging up all legitimate ex- 
penses, would be an equitable apportionment. 
If we do not go so far as this, and are content 
to claim that author and publisher should share 
equally, it will still be evident that the royalty 
of ten per cent, customary in this country for 
the majority even of fairly successful authors, 
does not give them anything like half the profits 
arising from their books. The sales have only 
to reach two or three thousand to make this a 
very one-sided arrangement, as will be evident 
enough from an inspection of Sir Walter's fig- 
ures, or of any similar figures based upon the 
conditions of production in this country. In 
fact, we need in the United States some such 
missionary work as has been done by him in 
conjunction with the Society of Authors in En- 
gland, and their activities should stimulate a 
similar movement among ourselves. Perhaps 
we may profit by their example to the extent 
of avoiding the bitterness of feeling that has 
been engendered in English publishing circles, 
but the interests of American authorship need 
to be championed with the same zeal and dis- 
tinguished ability. 

The "method of the future," Sir Walter 
believes and emphatically declares, is to be the 
method which treats the publisher as an agent 
working upon commission, " who will take none 
but commission books, who will take his com- 
mission, and no more." This suggestion has 
been received with much derision by Sir Wal- 
ter's publisher critics, and some of them have 
gone so far as to characterize it as absurd if 
not impossible. But its champion has abund- 
ant facts at his disposal in support of the propo- 
sition, and discussion of the subject has just 
brought him a very effective ally in the person 
of Mr. Herbert Spencer, who speaks of Sir 
Walter's proposed method as " that which I 
have pursued for the last fifty years, and with 
the most satisfactory results." More than a 
score of years ago, Mr. Spencer testified before 
the Copyright Commission that by this plan he 
received about thirty per cent (of the published 
price) upon a first edition of one thousand 
copies, and more than forty per cent upon sub- 
sequent editions printed from plates. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

AMERICAN VARIANTS OF NURSERY CLASSICS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The old nursery rhymes and jingles, children's play- 
ing games, etc., which have been current in baby-land 
for hundreds of years, have, like every other kind of 
folk-lore, been subject to all sorts of variants or cor- 
ruptions, call them what you will; and the standard 
text always cited in disputed readings is that of Halli- 
well an English authority. 

But our own distinctly developing national charac- 
teristics, local influence, and the cosmopolitan admix- 
tures in American life, have had their effect upon these 
Nursery Classics, and not only has a whole group of 
distinctively American variants grown up, but a very 
great number of fresh additions to nursery and child-lore 
have been made since the first " Mother Goose " was 
reprinted in this country. 

A number of friends all over the States are helping 
in the collection of new material of this kind, and if any 
of your readers are sufficiently interested in the subject 
to take the trouble to write down any of the nursery 
rhymes and jingles with which they may be familiar, 
and send them to me, especially those they know to be 
local or distinctly American, they may help to bring to 
light much that would otherwise escape, and will aid in 
the most interesting work of showing how far America 
has gone in the direction of evolving a National Nursery

WAS FOE MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I wish to comment upon two sentences in the inter- 
esting article of Mr. Charles Leonard Moore in THE 
DIAL of Jan. 16, entitled " The American Rejection of 
Poe": 

" Poe, a logic machine, was absolutely incapable of those 
pleasing flaws and deficiencies which allow other people to 
have a good opinion of themselves. He always added up true." 

Probably most persons would think of " The Gold- 
Bug " as the best illustration of the accurate working of 
Poe's mind. The celebrated " cryptograph " there found 
solves itself all right, I presume. There are some 
mathematical statements in this story, however, which 
seem to me impossible. 

The negro, Jupiter, is compelled by his master, 
William Legrand, to climb " an enormously tall tulip- 
tree, which . . . far surpassed ... all other trees 
which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage 
and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the 
general majesty of its appearance." The first great 
branch was " some sixty or seventy feet from the 
ground." Jupiter is told to pass by six large limbs on 
a particular side of this tree, and to climb out upon the 
seventh. This last proves to be a dead branch, but 
capable of bearing the negro's weight, and he climbs 
" mos' out to the eend." Here he discovers a skull 
nailed to the limb. Legrand tells him to use the " gold- 
bug," tied to the end of a string, as a plumb-line, drop- 
ping it through " the left eye of the skull." A peg is 
driven into the ground at the precise spot where the 
beetle falls. Legrand then fastened one end of a tape- 
measure " at that point of the trunk of the tree which 
was nearest the peg, . . . unrolled it till it reached the

peg, and thence further unrolled it, in the direction 
already established, . . . for the distance of fifty feet." 
About the spot thus obtained as a centre, the three as- 
sociates excavated a pit four feet in diameter to the 
depth of seven feet, but found nothing. It was then 
discovered that Jupiter had dropped the beetle through 
the wrong eye. The next time it fell at " a spot about 
three inches " from the previous point. " Taking, now, 
the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk 
to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a 
straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was in- 
dicated, removed by several yards from the point at 
which we had been digging." 

The impossibility of the statement italicized will be 
at once apparent. If the skull was found ten feet away 
from the trunk of the tree was it not farther ? 
the centre of the new circle for digging was about 
six times three inches from the point about which they 
dug at first. If the skull were only five feet from the 
trunk, the second point for digging would be about 
thirty-three inches from the first. 

The journey of the three associates to the place 
where the chest was discovered lay " through a tract of 
country excessively wild and desolate." After travel- 
ling "for about two hours," they "entered a region 
infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. It was a 
species of tableland, near the summit of an almost in- 
accessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, 
and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie 
loosely upon the soil. . . . Deep ravines, in various di- 
rections, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the 
scene." 

The chest found contained " rather more than four 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars " in gold coins of 
various nations, " estimating the value of the pieces, as 
accurately as we could, by the tables of the period." 
The gold dollar of the United States weighs 25 4-5 
grains, and there are 7,000 grains in the avoirdupois 
pound. Gold coin to the value of $450,000 would 
weigh, roughly stated, about 1,655 pounds. Poe tells us 
that the weight of the other valuables in the chest " ex- 
ceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois," 
not including "one hundred and ninety-seven superb 
gold watches." This makes the total weight of treasure 
over 2,000 pounds. The three companions, unexhausted 
by their journey and prolonged digging, carried home 
one-third of this treasure in the solid chest over the 
route indicated above. They reached their hut "in 
safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the 
morning." After a rest of one hour, they set off, " armed 
with three stout sacks," to secure the remaining two- 
thirds of the booty. They got back to the hut with this, 
"just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed 
from over the treetops in the East." On the second re- 
turn journey, if my estimates " add up true," each of 
the three must have carried about 450 pounds of gold 
and gems. Certainly, at the time of this achievement, 
Poe who tells the story as if himself the third party 
in the enterprise had not weakened his bodily powers 
by dissipation. 

In " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " we read : 
"On the hearth were two or three long and thick 
tresses of gray human hair, also dabbled with blood, and 
seeming to have been pulled out by the roots." Later 
in the story, the infallible Dupin says: "You saw the 
locks in question as well as myself. Their roots (a 
hideous sight !) were clotted with fragments of the flesh 
of the scalp sure token of the prodigious power which 



had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of 
hairs at a time." (The italics are mine.) 

The Bible suggests that God alone can accurately 
number the hairs upon the human head; but I cannot 
think that it would have involved any impiety if Poe 
had made his partial estimate in this passage a little 
more reasonable. 

Let us disabuse our minds, then, of the notion that 
Poe always "adds up true." 

Poe's fame is secure, though he can never be popu- 
lar. His was essentially an original mind : he was a lit- 
erary discoverer, and the world does not often forget its 
discoverers. His message is mainly, perhaps, to literary 
craftsmen. Whether we think of the detective story; 
of the scientific romance, since carried further by Jules 
Verne and others; of what I can only call "the short- 
story of atmosphere "; of certain fundamental truths in 
" the philosophy of composition "; of the true theory of 
English versification, since elaborated by Sidney Lanier; 
or of Poe's own peculiar type of intensely musical poetry, 
with its fascinating use of tone-color, parallelism, and 
repetition we can say, I believe, with substantial truth, 
that he was 

". . . . the first that ever burst 
Into that silent sea."

THE MACHINE THEORY OF HISTORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Will you permit me a word with reference to that 
" machine theory " of history to which Dr. Hinsdale, in 
your issue of Feb. 16, justly takes exception? History 
is a science, and should be scientifically studied. Sci- 
ence is concerned with facts. The facts respect the 
nature, action, evolution, and effects of substances and 
forces. The facts of history have regard to men, and 
ought to exhibit the action, development, and progres- 
sive influence of the forces of his nature. We wish 
to learn from history what man has done, and why he 
has done certain things. 

As in a natural science we learn the significance of 
phenomena from their causes and effects, so in history 
we find the meaning of man's actions in his character, 
the motives that control or direct his movements. Only 
in this way can we make a just estimate of an actor's 
career, and gain trustworthy and valuable instruction 
from the experience of those who have preceded us. 
What signified the deeds of a Pericles, an Alexander, a 
Marcus Aurelius, or a Caracalla? Do we find the mean- 
ing of their lives in the isolated phenomena called their 
acts, without inquiring whether these were laudable or 
culpable? In some cases, perchance, two persons of 
opposite character did like things. Did their doings 
have the same significance and influence? If we wished 
to direct our life by theirs, should we simply ask what 
things they did? 

The reciter of acts and occurrences is merely a diar- 
ist, an annalist, or a compiler. The historian, worthy 
of the name, is not a mere collector of political or social 
phenomena. He must form judgments of men and re- 
late their acts to their character. He must be judicial, 
and must know the conclusions of science in its promi- 
nent departments; for he should tell us not merely what 
men have done, but what their lives have meant.

LEWIS CARROLL, OF WONDERLAND.* 



That was a sensible bit of advice given to 
" Lewis Carroll " in a letter from his occa- 
sional publisher, Mrs. Gatty, in 1867, in which, 
after complimenting her correspondent on the 
quality of a sketch about to appear in her mag- 
azine, the lady went on to say : 

" One word more. Make this [story] one of a series. 
You have great mathematical abilities, but so have 
hundreds of others. This talent is peculiarly your own, 
and as an Englishman you are almost unique in pos- 
sessing it. If you covet fame, therefore, it will be, I 
think, gained by this." 

"Lewis Carroll " (as perhaps not a few read- 
ers may even to-day need to be reminded) was 
the pen-name of the Reverend Charles L. 
Dodgson, Mathematical Lecturer at Christ 
Church, Oxford, and an author of repute in 
the abstruse field mildly disparaged by Mrs. 
Gatty. For a period covering almost the last 
half-century, he belonged to "The House," 
scarcely ever leaving it ; and, says his biogra- 
pher (himself of Christ Church), " I, for one, 
can hardly imagine it without him." While 
attending closely to his professional studies and 
duties, he early began relaxing his mind and 
indulging his natural bent in writing humorous 
verses for " The Comic Times," a London imi- 
tator of " Punch," which soon after became 
merged in a new venture, " The Train "; and 
it was in The Train " (of May, 1856) that 
his future famous pseudonym, " Lewis Car- 
roll," first appeared. 

Under the date July 4, 1862, there is a very 
interesting entry in the Diary : 

" I made an expedition up the river to Godstow with 
the three Liddells; we had tea on the bank there, and 
did not reach Christ Church till half-past eight. . . . 
On which occasion I told them the fairy-tale of ' Alice's 
Adventures Underground,' which I undertook to write 
out for Alice." 

It was on this summer afternoon that Mr. 
Dodgson improvised for the amusement of the 
three little girls who accompanied him those 
adventures in " Wonderland," which were later 
re-written for publication by the advice of 
George Macdonald, who had seen the story in 
the original manuscript as written out by the 
narrator for Miss Alice Liddell. " Alice " 
herself (now Mrs. Reginald Hargreaves) gives 

*THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF LEWIS CARROLL (Rev. C. L. 
Dodgson). By Stuart Dodgson Collingwood. Illustrated.

the following pleasant account of the momen- 
tous excursion up the Thames : 

"Most of Mr. Dodgson's stories were told to us on 
river expeditions to Nuneham or Godstow, near Oxford. 
My eldest sister was c Prirna,' I was ' Secunda,' and 
' Tertia ' was my sister Edith. I believe the beginning 
of ' Alice ' was told one summer afternoon when the 
sun was so burning that we had landed in the meadows 
down the river, deserting the boat to take refuge in the 
only bit of shade to be found, which was under a new- 
made hayrick. Here from all three came the old peti- 
tion, Tell us a story,' and so began the ever delightful 
tale. Sometimes to tease us Mr. Dodgson would stop 
suddenly and say, ' And that's all till next time.' Ah, 
but it is next time,' * would be the exclamation from 
all three; and after some persuasion the story would 
begin afresh. Another day, perhaps, the story would be 
begun in the boat, and Mr. Dodgson, in the middle of 
telling a thrilling adventure, would pretend to go fast 
asleep, to our great dismay." 

On July 4, 1865, just three years after the 
memorable row up the river, Miss Liddell re- 
ceived the first presentation copy of " Alice's- 
Adventures in Wonderland," the second copy 
going to Princess Beatrice. 

In 1867 Mr. Dodgson published his book 
on " Determinants," and we can fancy the sur- 
prise of the Christ Church undergraduate* 
when they learned that " Lewis Carroll " of 
" Wonderland " was none other than their pre- 
ceptor of the lecture hall and author of that 
learned treatise. 

In 1857 Mr. Dodgson first met Tennyson, 
whom he thus describes : 

"A strange shaggy-looking man ; his hair, moustache, 
and beard looked wild and neglected ; these very much 
hid the character of the face. He was dressed in a 
loosely fitting morning coat, common grey flannel waist- 
coat and trousers, and a carelessly tied black silk hand- 
kerchief. His hair is black; I think the eyes too; they 
are keen and restless nose aquiline forehead high 
and broad both face and head are high and manly. 
His manner was kind from the first; there is a dry lurk- 
ing humor in his style of talking." 

Mr. Dodgson's faculty for seeing things in a 
funny or extravagant light is illustrated by his 
amusing descriptions of Berlin, which place he 
visited while on a continental tour with Dr. 
Liddon. 

". . . Wherever there is room on the ground [they 3 
put either a circular group of busts on pedestals, in 
consultation, all looking inwards or else the colossal 
figure of a man killing, about to kill, or having killed 
(the present tense is preferred) a beast; the more pricks 
the beast has, the better, in fact, a dragon is the cor- 

* " And ever, as the story drained 

The wells of fancy dry, 
And faintly strove that weary one 

To put the subject by, 
' The rest next time ' 'It is next time !' 
The happy voices cry."

rect thing, but if that is beyond the artist he may con- 
tent himself with a lion or a pig. The beast-killing 
principle has been carried out everywhere with a relent- 
less monotony, which makes some parts of Berlin look 
like a fossil slaughter-house." 

Early in 1869 Mr. Dodgson's "Phantas- 
magoria " was published, and a few days later 
the first chapter of " Behind the Looking- 
Glass " was sent to the press. In 1871 the lat- 
ter story appeared, and at once scored a huge 
success. " I can say with a clear head and 
conscience " (wrote Henry Kingsley to the au- 
thor) " that your new book is the finest thing 
we have had since ' Martin Chuzzlewit '." 
" Jabberwocky," Mr. Collingwood says, was at 
once recognized as " the best and most original 
thing in the book"; and we learn, as to the 
origin of this (to our thinking) rather silly 
production, that it was composed as a contri- 
bution to a game of " verse-making " at an 
evening party. Much may be risked with a 
public that accepts rhymed gibberish as humor ; 
and in 1876 Mr. Dodgson put forth his " Hunt- 
ing of the Snark," a chef-d'oeuvre of sheer 
nonsense over which John Bull grinned for a 
twelvemonth. By the Browning Clubs " The 
Snark " was rapturously hailed as a godsend in 
the way of a new repository of hidden mean- 
ings, until the author set speculation of that 
sort at rest by calmly announcing that his poem 
had no meaning at all. " I 'm very much afraid," 
he wrote to an anxious elucidator of poetic rid- 
dles in America, " that 1 did n't mean anything 
but nonsense," thus closing forever a most 
promising field of research. 

In 1879 appeared Mr. Dodgson's most elabo- 
rate mathematical work, " Euclid and His Mod- 
ern Rivals," an original book in its way, cast 
in dramatic form, and relieved by humorous 
touches in the author's happier and saner vein. 
In 1883 occurred his controversy with the 
" trade," in the course of which appeared his 
pamphlet on " The Profits of Authorship." 
Touching the publisher's share of the spoils, 
he wrote : 

"The publisher contributes about as much as the 
bookseller in time and bodily labor, but in mental toil 
and trouble a great deal more. I speak with some 
personal knowledge of the matter, having myself, for 
some twenty years, inflicted on that most patient and 
painstaking firm, Messrs. Macmillan & Co., about as 
much wear and worry as ever publishers have lived 
through. The day when they undertake a book is a 
dies nefastus with them. ... I think the publisher's 
claim on the profits is on the whole stronger than the 
bookseller's." 

" A Tangled Tale," one of the best of Mr. 
Dodgson's books, and a most quaint and de- 



lightful medley of fun and mathematics, came 
out in 1885. A brief quotation will show the 
whimsical turn of the humor. " Balbus " (a 
tutor) and his pupils go in search of lodgings, 
and one of the party, after the usual questions, 
anxiously inquires of the landlady " if the cat 
scratches." 

" The landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to 
make sure the cat was not listening. I will not deceive 
you gentlemen,' she said. It do scratch, but not with- 
out you pull its whiskers ! It '11 never do it,' she re- 
peated slowly, with a visible effort as if to recall the exact 
words of some written agreement between herself and 
the cat,' without you pulls its whiskers ! ' Much may 
be excused in a cat so treated,' said Balbus as they left 
the house and crossed to No. 70, leaving the landlady 
curtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to her- 
self, as if they were a form of blessing ' not without 
you pulls its whiskers ' ! " 

Mr. Dodgson's next book was " The Game 
of Logic " (1887), an elementary method for 
children, rendered palatable by such quaint 
syllogisms as 

" No bald person needs a hair-brush ; 
No lizards have hair : 

No lizard needs a hair brush." 

" Sylvie and Bruno " was issued in 1889, and 
its sequel " Sylvie and Bruno Concluded " fol- 
lowed four years later. In this work, Mr. 
Collingwood says, are embodied the ideals and 
sentiments most dear to the author. It is didac- 
tic in aim, written with a definite purpose of 
turning its writer's influence to account in en- 
forcing neglected truths ; but it falls short of the 
fresh and spontaneous " Alice " books as a work 
of art considerably short of them, we think. 

Mr. Dodgson died at Guildford Rectory, on 
January 14, 1898, and he lies in Guildford 
Churchyard, under a white cross bearing the 
name " Lewis Carroll " surely one, in a spe- 
cial sense, to conjure with. " Lewis Carroll " 
may be numbered with those writers of our 
day who have added a new note to literature ; 
therefore his books have that in them which is 
likely to win them readers for many years to 
come. " Alice in Wonderland " may well 
prove to be one of the world's books whose 
freshness time cannot stale. Mr. Collingwood's 
Life leaves with us the wholesome impression 
of a singularly pure and engaging character, 
and no lover of " Lewis Carroll " should fail to 
read it. The book is a pretty one, richly illus- 
trated, mainly with photographic plates of Mr. 
Dodgson's friends, including portraits of Ten- 
nyson, Alice Liddell, Hunt, Millais, the Ros- 
settis, Tenniel, Ellen and Kate Terry, Mr. 
Ruskin the last, one is constrained to hope, 
a bad likeness. E. G. J.

ARISTOTELJANISM AND THE MODERN 
SPIRIT.* 



It is true, Aristotelianism has been shorn of 
its authority as an officially sanctioned system 
of philosophy and science, a species of au- 
thority, however, contradictory to the spirit of 
that system and of its originator. It is no 
longer the official philosophy of the academic 
world, or even of the Roman court as in the 
days of the Scholastics. But had the free, 
inquiring, progressive spirit of Aristotle lived 
amongst the Scholastics, he would unquestion- 
ably have been an anti- Aristotelian. He would 
have joined the ranks of his historical adver- 
saries. Authority, in the sense of a binding or 
school dogma, is a fetich to which Aristotle 
never paid homage. On the other hand, there 
is another form of authority still left to him, 
namely, the authority which proceeds from the 
prestige of a great reputation and from intrinsic 
reasonableness of doctrine. It cannot be gain- 
said that there is a cogency merely in a great 
name or reputation which forces or tends to 
force assent. The popular ascription of supe- 
riority to any man carries with it the conces- 
sion of authority in that particular reference. 
It is a type of hero-worship, in which we now- 
adays reserve to ourselves the democratic free- 
dom of electing our authorities in terms of our 
own prejudices. 

Generally speaking, we have in philosophy 
and science no authority foisted on us, save 
what comes from the officialdom of popular 
opinion, or, in certain circles, from ecclesiast- 
ical tradition. Belief in the possibility of an 
absolute exorcism of the supposed evil spirit of 
authority is merely the hallucination of a man 
who sees visions. And even if such exorcism 
were possible, there is ground for reasonable 
doubt whether it would be desirable. The spirit 
of trust, of reverence for authority, and the con- 
tentment of a conservative mind, are real safe- 
guards to the direction of development. Mere 
motion is not always progress, and radicalism 
is not a synonym of advancement. Against 
excesses of radicalism and the spirit of mere 
mobility we are equipped with a wholesome 
counter-instinct of reverence for the traditional 
and of caution in revolutionary measures. 

The early years of the struggle of modern 
science under the influence of Bacon and the 
anti- Scholastics are often characterized as a

revolt against the bondage of Aristotelianism 
and as emancipation from the errors of that 
system. To such a degree is this true, that 
writers are often disposed to blame Aristotle 
personally and to regard him as the arch-enemy 
of progress. In view of this attitude on the 
part of modern critics of the progress of sci- 
ence, it is curious to note the fact that Aristotle 
a year before he died fled from Athens owing 
to an indictment for heresy and ultra-progres- 
siveness ; while the progressive liberals of the 
Baconian era bring an indictment against him 
as the inspiring genius of the ultra-conservatives. 
Thus, owing to the immense change in the 
Zeitgeist, diametrically opposite charges are 
brought against the same philosopher. 

The truth is that Aristotle is not to be meas- 
ured by the use made of a part of his system 
by the Roman Catholic Church, but by the 
advancement in science made by him over his 
own predecessors and by the intrinsic worth of 
his own philosophy ; i.e., he is to be measured 
both by reference to his historical environment 
and the then contemporary state of science, as 
well as by the test of the reasonableness and 
suggestiveness of his doctrines. He is in no- 
wise chargeable with the stagnation of the 
middle ages, unless we are to censure the mag- 
nitude of his genius for reducing Europe dur- 
ing these long centuries to almost abject intel- 
lectual slavery. The fault was not in the master, 
but in the slave. Further, we cannot rationally 
pass censure on him for not having observed 
that which can be seen only by the aid of a 
microscope or other instrument of modern 
invention. It is mainly by virtue of instru- 
mental equipment, the collection of large bodies 
of material, the organized cooperation of sci- 
entists, and the increased facilities for record 
and distribution of results of investigations, 
that modern science has triumphed over the 
ancient, and not by virtue of any superior 
intellectual endowment or acumen. On the 
other hand, where modern science has gained 
in intension it has lost in extension. It is, to 
be sure, satisfied with this sacrifice of the quan- 
titative for the qualitative. At the time Aris- 
totle wrote, the methods of the exact sciences 
were not known. One would, therefore, expect 
to find him most successful in ethics, politics, 
and metaphysics ; and this we find to be true, 
although modern scientists have bestowed un- 
measured praise on his work in the investiga- 
tion of nature. This praise is due mainly to 
the fact that he clearly saw the superior value 
of the objective over the subjective method in 



194

natural science, and saw it in spite of the well- 
nigh complete bondage of his contemporaries to 
a priori speculation. 

For this reason certain modern scientists 
have bestowed on the Stagirite praise as exag- 
gerated as were the denunciations of Bacon, 
UamuH, or Luther. Between the unqualified 
detraction on the one hand, mere dreary ex- 
posure of mistakes, and the inordinate praise 
and impossible eulogies on the other, Zeller 
maintains a sobriety of criticism which forces 
the reader's confidence. Cuvier, on the con- 
trary, commenting on the " History of Ani- 
mals," says : " I cannot read this book without 
being ravished with astonishment. Indeed, it 
is impossible to conceive how a single man was 
able to collect and compare the multitude of 
particular facts implied in the numerous gen- 
eral rules and aphorisms contained in this work, 
and of which his predecessors never had any 
idea." Buffon, speaking of the same work, 
says : " Aristotle's ' History of Animals ' is 
perhaps even now the best work of its kind ; 
he probably knew animals better and under 
more general views than we do now." Even 
George H. Lewes, who quotes the foregoing 
passages from " The French Historians of Na- 
ture," and who has the strong anti-metaphys- 
ical bias of Positivism and is usually a severe 
critic of Aristotle, in speaking of Aristotelian- 
ism in general, says : " His [Aristotle's] attain- 
ments surpassed those of every known philos- 
opher ; his influence has only been exceeded 
by the great founders of religions." St. George 
Mivart goes the length of saying (" Contem- 
porary Evolution," p. 179) : " What is needed, 
and what evolution will in fallibly bring about, 
is not a return to a philosophy, but a return to 
the philosophy. For if metaphysics are possi- 
ble, there is not, and never was or will be, more 
than one philosophy, which, properly under- 
stood, unites all speculative truths and elimi- 
nates all errors : the philosophy of the philoso- 
pher Aristotle." Romanes, who cannot be 
accused of having any bias for Aristotle, says : 
" Whether we look to its width or to its depth, 
we must alike conclude that the range of Aris- 
totle's work is wholly without a parallel in the 
history of mankind." (" Contemporary Re- 
view," Vol. 59, p. 276.) Luther, whose attacks 
on Aristotle exhibit an animus which one would 
expect, usually denounces him in toto, but in 
one passage (Bd. Ixii., p. 262, Erlangen ed.) 
he concedes Aristotle's excellence in ethics, 
while, in a high-handed way, he summarily and 
unexplainedly condemns his philosophy of na- 



ture : "Aristoteles ist der besten Lehrer einer in 
Philosophia morali, wie man ein fein ziichtig 
ausserlich Leben fiihren soil ; in naturali Phil- 
osophia taug er nichts." Again : " Der weise 
Mann Aristoteles schleusset fast dahin, es sei 
die Welt von Ewigkeit gewesen. Da muss 
man je sagen, er habe gar nichts von dieser 
Kunst gewusst" (Bd. xxiii., p. 241). This 
denunciation was all because Aristotle's cos- 
mical theories, especially that of the eternity 
of the world, conflicted with the Lutheran the- 
ology. 

Between the exaggerated praise of Buffon 
and the exaggerated denunciation of Luther, 
there is, as usual, a truer middle ground. 
While Aristotle's works teem with scientific 
blunders, they are also filled with fundamental 
and epoch-making truths, and it is not an over- 
statement of historical fact to say that no spirit 
in the progress of civilization has exerted so 
profound an influence on the life of science as 
Aristotle. In the pre-scholastic centuries this 
influence was exerted mainly through the trea- 
tises on Logic ; but from the time of Thomas 
Aquinas the introduction of natural science 
into the Western world by the Arabs, the entire 
body of the Aristotelian canon was known to 
European scholars. It must not be supposed 
that Aristotelianism is at the present moment 
extinct. The religious system of John of 
Damascus, which is founded on Aristotle's log- 
ical and metaphysical doctrines, is to this 
day recognized as the standard of orthodox 
dogmatic theology in the Greek Church, while 
in the Roman Catholic Church under the pa- 
tronage of the present Pope, Leo XIII. , the 
influence of the Aristotleian Aquinas is espe- 
cially in the ascendant. So that Aristotelian- 
ism is still a living and vital element in these 
two immensely potent forces of the Greek and 
Roman ecclesiastical organizations. 

The height of Aristotle's influence was 
reached in the twelfth century, at which time 
he dominated the best educated and most subtle 
minds of Europe. In the early part of that 
century the Arabs of Spain became the masters 
of the schoolmen, and through Averroes (Ibn 
Raschd) made themselves powerful factors in 
the contemporary civilization ; but the Spanish 
Aristotelianism stood for pantheism in which 
all special providence was denied. This doc- 
trine was formally repudiated by the Latin 
Church, and in 1270 was anathematized by the 
Bishop of Paris. Besides Thomas Aquinas, 
Albert the Great was a leading figure in the 
Aristotelianism of that century, and a little

later Dante was moulded in the study of the 
Stagirite. In his vision in the fourth canto 
of the " Paradise " he speaks thus of il maestro : 

" When I had lifted up my brows a little 
The master I beheld of those who know 
Sit with his philosophic family. 
All gaze upon him and do him honor." 

(iv. 131, Longfellow" 1 s Translation.) 

During the Renaissance the " Ethics " and 
" Politics " were widely read. In the seven- 
teenth century Aristotle's influence waned, 
owing to the tendency in the new natural sci- 
ence to independent observation. Again, at 
the beginning of the present century we find 
an important revival of Aristotelian studies 
under the leadership of Trendelenburg. It is 
the beginning of a period characterized by the 
rise of historical criticism and the wane of dog- 
matism, whose direction was largely given by 
Lessing, himself a devoted student of Aristotle. 
In the early decades the Berlin Academeny of 
Sciences issued the great standard quarto edi- 
tion of all the works, including " Scholia," etc., 
on which was employed the flower of Ger- 
many's scholarship ; in the thirties, Barthe- 
lemy Saint - Hilaire began his monumental 
French version, which he lived to complete after 
sixty years of labor interrupted at intervals by 
civic duties. Grote, the historian, left us the 
torso of two volumes that illustrate even more 
than his other writings his splendid industry. 
It was this work, to which Grote was devoting 
the last years of his failing health but perennial 
enthusiasm, that induced him to decline a peer- 
age of the United Kingdom offered in the pre- 
miership of Gladstone. 

Besides the foregoing, a large number of 
volumes on particular parts or aspects of Aris- 
totle's system have appeared in Germany, 
France, and England, but nothing has been 
published during the century of more consid- 
erable moment for Aristotelian studies than the 
two volumes of Zeller now before us, giving 
as they do a systematic exposition of the sig- 
nificance and content of the whole of the Peri- 
patetic philosophy, with a critical estimation 
of its value and defects, and an account of its 
external history. One is especially glad to have 
it in English, for we have nothing whatever 
that satisfies this lacuna in our literature. 
Zeller is, without exception, the most skilful 
interpreter of Greek philosophical ideas that 
ever put pen to the subject, and it will be many 
a long year before his work is antiquated. He 
has a rare combination of fine critical acumen, 
power of lucid and orderly statement, just dis- 
crimination of the values of evidence, immense 



patience for detail, astounding range and pre- 
cision of learning, and withal a judicial spirit 
in the handling of controversial matter. He 
rejects without flinching all interpretations 
inspired by harmonistic tendencies, however 
skilfully they may rescue Aristotle's consist- 
ency and relieve him from the charge of con- 
tradiction ; and everywhere he maintains a 
rigidly conscientious attitude toward the canons 
of evidence. Although he does not underesti- 
mate the profound intrinsic significance of the 
Aristotelian system or its great influence on the 
processes of civilization, he never attempts to 
smoothe away difficulties by forced explana- 
tions. He has the courage to leave these dis- 
crepancies as they are. 

The translators have done skilful work in 
giving us a really English treatise, which brings 
the reader scarcely a suggestion of its foreign 
source. Zeller never fails to make his state- 
ments in clear, unmistakable sentences, very 
unlike the usual treatise that comes from Ger- 
man scholars. His manner of writing is akin 
to that of the Anglo-Saxon genius ; and his 
translators have been, for this reason, the more 
easily able to provide an English version which 
might well have been originally an English 
Classic. The volumes have a value of the first 
order. One is almost disposed to think of them 
as definitive in their method of structure, while 
their subject-matter is indubitably of lasting 
interest. 

The ultimate problems of philosophy may 
still be awaiting their satisfactory solution, and 
men of science have now and again decried the 
attempt as impossible ; yet, as Kant says in the 
l&itik der reinen Vernunft (Max Miiller's 
trans., p. xxxi.) : " It is vain to assume a kind 
of artificial indifferentism in respect to inquiries 
the object of which cannot be indifferent to 
human nature." The teachings of Aristotle 
are of both historical and present interest. In 
certain disciplines, the important thing is not 
the state of contemporary science, but the per- 
sonality of the thinker. In ethics, e. g., the 
deliverances of great spirits are not so much 
affected by the conditions of science as by the 
temperament of the man, the character of his 
will, and the energy of his feeling and vision. 
The utterances of such spirits on subjects of 
this kind do not become obsolete. What was 
said by Socrates, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, 
and Jesus, on the nature of the moral life is in 
the main universally applicable, and not pe- 
culiar to conditions of time or place. In 
questions where one is concerned with the 



196

[March 16, 



immutable principles of human nature, the 
deliverances of men who have had a genius for 
morality (men may have a genius for morality 
as much as for mathematics) are as little sub- 
ject to obsoletism as the Homeric epics, the 
creations of Dante, or the divine forms of 
Gothic art. And these problems of the human 
spirit and its relation to the conduct of life 
and to the nature and knowledge of reality, 
although they may be most difficult of solu- 
tion, none the less they do lie nearest to the 
heart. The answers we find to such ques- 
tions amongst the Greeks, and particularly in 
Aristotle, are marked by the rigor of original- 
ity, clear, simple, without artificiality. Greece, 
to use an idea of Trendelenburg's, is not our 
gray antiquity so much as the fresh youth of

SIR RICHARD BURTON'S POSTHUMOUS 
PAPERS.* 



When Richard Burton died at Trieste in 
1890, the world lost an intrepid explorer, a 
keen observer, and a polyglot scholar. His ad- 
venturous career was unique in the nineteenth 
century, and will find no successor in the twen- 
tieth. He had ranged the habitable globe 
the Orient and tropics by preference ; and 
had studied anthropology at first-hand, with an 
unsurpassed equipment for his work. In him 
were united English tenacity, Anglo-Saxon 
restlessness, a gift for languages like that of 
Mezzofanti, and a certain trampling brusque 
power of description that always seemed confi- 
dent of winning by the mere fascination of its 
material. 

Burton was a " much-neglected traveller "; 
what honors he had came late ; and the posthum- 
ous honor which may come from this triad of 
essays will hardly add to his varied fame, though 
in certain respects they are faithful suggestions 
of the man. In addition to the forty-eight 
works published during his life, there were left 
at his death some twenty MSS., the publication 
of which was placed absolutely within the dis- 
cretion of his widow, Lady Burton. She pub- 
lished her " Life of Sir Richard Barton," and 
editions of his " Arabian Nights," " Catullus," 
and " II Pentamerone "; and was arranging 
for the publication of others, when she died 



* THE JEW, THE GYPSY, AND EL ISLAM. By Sir Richard 
F. Burton. Edited by W. H. Wilkins. Chicago : Herbert 
S. Stone & Co. 



(March, 1896) ; and the MSS. with the dis- 
cretion were entrusted to Mr. Wilkins. 

The three papers now brought together by 
Mr. Wilkins are of unequal merit. The first 
one, "The Jew," is an unfavorable criticism 
upon the most persistent race in history : its 
steadily anti-Semitic spirit would delight the 
soul of Pastor Stoecker or the Jew-baiting pop- 
ulace of Paris. Burton's various Eastern con- 
sulates enabled him to know the Jews of the 
Orient widely and well ; but his attempt to de- 
fend the atrocities against the Jews of the 
Middle Ages by the suggestion of previous 
greater atrocities committed by them is gratu- 
itous. The chapter on the Talmud is interest- 
ing ; but the mingled absurdity and vindictive- 
ness of its anti-Gentile teachings are shown up 
with a relish which is unpleasant to contem- 
plate. The truth is that none of us, as nations, 
can turn over the leaves of our darker youth 
without wincing ; and it is unfair to erect the 
police reports of the Levant into a studied 
indictment of a race whose achievements and 
services to civilization are conceded by all who 
read history with untrammelled judgment. 

" The Gypsy " is an attractive ethnological 
study, for the writing of which Burton was 
admirably well-equipped, even if he had not in 
his veins that infusion of Romany blood with 
which he was generally credited. Its merits 
are somewhat impaired by a lack of proportion : 
nearly half of the 150 pages being a polemic 
against the claims of M. Paul Bataillard to 
priority in identifying the Gypsies with the Jat 
of the banks of the Indus. This, as well as the 
comparative word-lists, can naturally be of 
interest to very few outside the ranks of experts 
in " Chinganology." But the chapters devoted 
to a survey of the " children of out-of-doors " in 
the various continents, whether called Gitano, 
Zigeuner, Tzigane, or Jat, are really fascinat- 
ing, and could have been written by no one 
else. Burton penetrated everywhere, was under- 
stood of the Gypsies in all lands, and learned 
their traditions and character with a complete- 
ness approached by no other Englishman, ex- 
cept, perhaps, his great contemporary, George 
Borrow. 

" El Islam," the third in this group of studies, 
is an essay of about sixty-five pages. It was 
written, as Mr. Wilkins tells us, about 1853, 
soon after that daring and successful pilgrim- 
age to Mecca which made Burton famous. It 
is a sympathetic apologia for the " Saving 
Faith "; and the tone is, on the whole, both 
moderate and philosophic. With Burton's

usual lack of perspective, however, nearly two- 
thirds of the paper is given to a resume of the 
other great religions displaced by Islamism in 
the Orient ; and the author has thus left him- 
self only about twenty-five pages in which to 
establish his proposition. He sets himself the 
task of correcting what he believes to be the 
four most popular errors of the time (i. e., 
1853) in regard to El Islam. These are, in 
his own words, as follows : 

I. " It is determined to be merely a receptive 
faith, and therefore adapted only to that por- 
tion of mankind whose minds, still undeveloped 
and uncultivated, are unripe for a religion of 
principles." The author affirms this to be 
" partly correct of the corrupted, untrue of the 
pure, belief ; it will somewhat apply to the 
tenets of the Turks and Persians, but not to 
those of the first Muslims and the modern 
Wahabis." 

II. " Men object that The Saving Faith is 
one of pure sensuality." This is refuted by a 
summary of the numerous injunctions of the 
Koran, condemning nearly all the pleasures of 
this life ; followed by the claim that " those 
who best know El Islam, instead of charging it 
with sensuality, lament its leaven of asceticism. 
They regret to see men investing these fair 
nether scenes with mourning hues ; ' the world 
is the Muslim's prison, the tomb his stronghold, 
and Paradise his journey's end.' But this could 
not be otherwise. Asceticism and celibacy are 
the wonted growth of hot and Southern cli- 
mates, where man appears liable to a manner 
of religious monomania." 

III. " The third error is that the Founder of 
the Saving Faith began his ministry as an en- 
thusiast and ended it as an impostor." Burton's 
answer to this is substantially the tu quoque, 
claiming for Mohammed the full measure of 
sincerity conceded to other Founders. 

IV. " The fourth error is that Muhammad, 
unable to abolish certain superstitious rites and 
customs of the ancient and Pagan Arabs, incor- 
porated them into his scheme, and thus propi- 
tiated many that before avoided him." In the 
author's answer to this, which is too long to 
quote entire, we are prepared for his " conclu- 
sion of the whole matter," as follows : 

" Muhammad's mission, then, was one purely of re- 
form. He held that four dispensations had preceded 
his own, and that his object was to restore their pristine 
purity. But the Adamical had been obsoletized by the 
Noachian scheme; and this by the Mosaic, which, in its 
turn becoming defunct, had left all its powers and pre- 
rogatives to Christianity; thus also the latter dispensa- 
tion, in the fulness of time, had been superseded by the 



revelations of the Saving Faith. All the past was now 
effete and abrogated. All the future would be mere 
imposture; for his was the latest of religions, he the 
Soul of the Prophets." 

The book, it should be added, is beautifully 
printed and bound ; is provided with an index ; 
and has a finely etched portrait of Sir Richard 
Burton, from the painting by Lord Leighton.

HISTORICAL TREASURE TROVE.* 



The historian who records the recent mani- 
festations of good -will and esteem between 
Great Britain and the United States should 
give prominent place to the restoration to Mass- 
achusetts, in 1897, of the original manuscript 
of Governor Bradford's History of " Plimoth 
Plantation." No later occurrence between the 
two peoples, though in itself more sensational, 
can testify more unequivocally of an undercur- 
rent of mutual respect and affection than the 
romantic episode of this restoration. This 
record of a chapter in our early history is the 
candid and dignified statement, by one of the 
foremost actors, in language modest and unaf- 
fected, of that dramatic movement in the evo- 
lution of modern freedom which made the 
Pilgrims from eastern England the first found- 
ers of a newer England on the Western con- 
tinent. It is the contemporaneous recital, by 
one of themselves, of the successive acts for 
several decades of that Pilgrim company whose 
career has made a wonderful impress upon the 
history of the world, and of whom it was well 
said by Governor Wolcott, in his address ac- 
knowledging the receipt of the precious volume : 
" In the varied tapestry which pictures our 
national life, the richest spots are those where 
gleam the golden threads of conscience, cour- 
age, and faith, set in the web by that little 
band." 

The Bradford manuscript is a spontaneous 
revelation of that conscience, courage, and 
faith ; and as such, it is held dear in the affec- 
tions of all Americans. Lost to us for nearly 
a hundred years, it was found in the archives 
of the established church of that nation which 
has so often been represented as our hereditary 
enemy. After thirty-seven years of unsuccess- 
ful attempts to recover it, the patient and affa- 
ble solicitations of Senator Hoar and Ambas-

sador Bayard succeeded. Good-will was in- 
voked, rather than diplomacy, and it awoke an 
answering chord of good-will in Great Britain : 
the ecclesiastical authorities in the mother-land 
surrendered to the commonwealth of Massa- 
chusetts the custody of her heirloom, the sur- 
render being accompanied by conditions so 
little burdensome as to evince the sincere es- 
teem which prompted it. The story of the loss, 
the search, and the recovery is told in the intro- 
duction to the handsome reprint of the old man- 
uscript which the commonwealth has recently 
issued. 

This history was printed in 1856 from a copy 
which had been secured in England, so that its 
contents are already known to historical stu- 
dents. The present issue is, however, timely, 
and will be welcomed by American readers. It 
is a verified representation of the text of Gov- 
ernor Bradford, retaining all the variations of 
his independent spelling. Facsimiles of a few 
pages of his manuscript form appropriate illus- 
trations to the text. While this edition does 
not pretend to compete, in the esteem of anti- 
quarians with the elaborate edition which repro- 
duces the whole manuscript in facsimile, it will 
find high place with the reading public, by 
virtue of its clear typography and its well- 
ordered index. 

The quaint and almost archaic style of Brad- 
ford's prose is far from tiresome, and he is so 
faithful an annalist, and so free from undue 
self-assertion, as to give to his unfashionable 
diction a charm of its own. The faith, hope, 
and courage of that band of adventurous pil- 
grims shine through his pages, tempered by a 
charity which lends to the whole narrative a 
tone of impartiality characteristic of true his- 
tory. Important episodes are often illustrated 
by copies of original documents, as in the cases 
of the Mayflower Compact, the articles of the 
New England confederation, and much of the 
correspondence between the Pilgrims and the 
adventurers. Such writings give us history 
from original sources ; and imprints like this 
of writings of that class are appreciated and 
read with avidity by that largely increasing 
public who are delving in early American an- 
nals, and are daily finding new episodes of mar- 
vellous interest in our Colonial experiences.

MR. WILLIAM ARCHER, the well-known English dra- 
matic critic, is shortly to visit the United States for the

America." The articles will appear in what is now an 
international magazine, the " Pall Mall." 



FAITH AND FANTASY.* 



Faith, from the very nature of the case, is espe- 
cially exposed to becoming fantasy. Faith deals 
with the deeper implications of our sensuous life. 
The unseen and eternal are open to it. This ex- 
ploration, slipping the restraints of experience, is 
especially liable to become fanciful. Hardly another 
doctrine could have so opened the doors of imagina- 
tive thought of reason winged by fancy as the 
assertion that absolute truth is contained in Scrip- 
ture, and is open to any man's unfolding. The 
processes of each mind are thus given a final author- 
ity which needs no correction from the flow of events. 
Religious truth is made independent of that com- 
prehensive scheme of things of which it is a part. 
The rationalistic fancy of the ill-trained spirit meets 
with no check from the moral experience of the 
world, and with no instruction from the historical 
unfolding of our spiritual life. The lesson of events 
is lightly set aside in behalf of an immature render- 
ing of the fundamental conditions and principles 
of our being. Faith suffers the disparagement of 
fancy, because it takes no pains to steady itself by 
an accumulative rendering of the spiritual events of 
the world. 

We are disposed to accept as the keynote of the 
present criticism the brief discourse on " New Forms 
of Christian Education," by Mrs. Humphry Ward. 
Not because the religious thought of the world is 
ready to fall into harmony under it, but because it 
best presents the true constructive centre, subject 
to which the unison of faith is to be reached. Mrs. 
Ward summarizes her own view of Christian Edu- 
cation with much distinctness. Thus, she says in 
conclusion : 

" Each of those relations and duties may, if we will, 
be connected with the beloved and sacred name of him 
who stands both by inherent genius and by the irrevo- 
cable choice of men at the head of the spiritual life of 
Europe, and still bequeaths even to our far-off genera- 
tions the maintenance and spread of his work. All 
things may be done to God in Christ; and that our chil- 
dren should learn from us so to do them is the task of 
Christian education. Only in the patient struggle to 
fulfil it week by week, and day by day, till the educa- 
tion of childhood merges in the sterner education of 
maturity, can we hope, parent and child, teacher and 
taught, for the growth which alone is true life growth 
in that temper at once of self-surrender and indomitable

hope, which yields all that man has and does, his forms 
of faith, no less than the grosser claims of self and flesh, 
to the action of the indwelling, all-transforming God, 
whereof the chief representative in history is Jesus 
Christ." 

The address seems to us to be more pervaded by the 
sense of loss than by that of gain. Our attention 
is drawn rather to the salvage that attends upon a 
disastrous wreck than to the pure metal which comes 
forth when the dross has been purged from the ore 
in a refining process. The certainty of faith is 
greater, not less, when its data have been subjected 
to the most thorough sifting of experience. Only 
then are the breadth and inescapable force of our 
inferences apparent. 

The second book on our list, " The Preparation 
for Christianity," lies in line with this correction of 
belief by the history of its development. 

" The atmosphere of our lives was created by Him, 
far more completely than the majority of us are even 
vaguely aware; our institutions have been molded by 
His spirit; our most effective ideals centre in Him; and 
upon His career and all its consequences rests our hope 
for eternity. These are not opinions, but facts capable 
of no dispute whatsoever, simply because they are his- 
torical, and have been becoming more and more of the 
essence of history for nigh two thousand years. Conse- 
quently, no Christian can have a firmer foundation for 
his faith than that which rests immovable upon the his- 
torical influence issuing from the life of Christ " (p. 22). 

We are glad of a new work from Professor Wenley. 
His thought is wont to be free and stimulating. 
The purpose of the present volume is to trace the 
converging influences of Grecian, Jewish, and Ro- 
man civilization on Christianity. Any adequate 
treatment is exceedingly difficult. The theme read- 
ily lends itself to the intense and vague. The book 
has marked excellences. The criticism we should 
be most inclined to make is that the discussion is 
too purely one of ideas, a tracing of the intel- 
lectual and spiritual inheritance that has come down 
to us. The thought would have been made more 
definite, and at the same time more comprehensive, 
if the social life of which these ideas were the fer- 
ment the social life which limited them and was 
limited by them had been more fully given. This 
would have been in keeping with an introductory 
chapter in which the author lays strong emphasis on 
the unity of our lives in society. The entire theme, 
however, is like a rich and widely branching mine 
to be worked by many in many generations. Our 
author returns from his exploration with his own 
treasures. 

"Addresses to Women Engaged in Church 
Work " is a small volume made up of a few brief 
lectures waifs of stimulus and guidance in an ac- 
tive life. They lay little claim to literary form, 
but they are full of that earnest spiritual temper 
which renders the words and acts of Bishop Potter 
so valuable. The themes are of a character fitted 
to renew thought and impulse. 

The author of " Christ in the Industries " ex- 



plains his purpose at once. " It is written for busy 
people, who have no time for an extended treatise, 
and perhaps no tastes for the details of sociological 
study, and yet would like to keep abreast of modern 
movements, and of the new applications of Chris- 
tian thought." The volume lies in the line of this 
intention. Its subjects are : " The Dignity of 
Labor," " Social Transformations," " Some Friends 
of Labor," " Industrial Problems," " The Future of 
Labor in America." The volume is plain, whole- 
some bread, which should, in one form or another, 
be on every man's table. 

" The Sacrifice of Christ " is another effort to 
soften the colors in which orthodox belief has 
painted the death of Christ, and to give them a more 
subdued and natural expression. So far it is a 
response one that has often been made to that 
deepening impression by which the whole procedure 
of salvation becomes growth under the wide uni- 
versal conditions of physical and spiritual law. So 
far, we may feel disposed to commend the treatise, 
and yet we must think that a little more of the 
same process leaves only the faintest outline of the 
old conception. It is replaced by a less definite, 
but far more glorious, vision of spiritual life steadily 
unfolding within itself. 

" Christianity and Anti-Christianity " is a much 
belated volume. A title more immediately disclos- 
ing the purpose of the book would have been " Christ 
and Anti-Christ." Of all the fancies which have 
fastened on Christian faith, few have been more per- 
sistent and more misleading than that of Anti-Christ. 
The primary purpose of the author is to bring for- 
ward this shattered and discarded image, pad it into 
shape once more with the errors and alleged errors 
of science, literature, and social life, and set it up as 
a menace to unbelievers, and an historic landmark on 
the road to the New Jerusalem. That he does his 
work with more moderation than is wont to belong 
to this kind of effort, is but scant atonement for un- 
dertaking it at all. No labor could be more futile 
than one designed to crowd the truly prosperous 
events of our spiritual life off from their present 
natural basis and force them back on the out-worn 
uninstructive and unreal conceptions associated with 
Anti-Christ. 

" The Hope of Immortality " is another evidence 
both of faith and of the want of faith. If by faith 
we mean the rational hold of the mind on truths 
which cannot be proved, yet seem to it deeply 
involved in the facts before it, then no doctrine 
makes a more direct appeal to faith than that of 
immortality. The mind that has slight hold of the 
underlying principles of the spiritual world will 
always accept this belief with hesitancy. Those 
who find the foundations of religious doctrine dis- 
turbed by the changing currents of speculation will 
begin at once to distrust the full consummation of 
faith expressed in immortality. It is not strange 
then that many are striving to restore to the eye 
those spiritual forces that find their completion in a

future life. " The Hope of Immortality " is a sys- 
tematic, methodical treatise. It moves leisurely and 
comprehensively. It treats of the nature, history, 
and value of this belief ; of its evidence under two 
aspects, external and internal ; and of the amplifi- 
cations of the belief by Christianity. It is not quite 
sufficiently touched by the spiritual temper of our 
time. It is still possessed by convictions which have 
somewhat lost their hold. This is seen in the weight 
it gives to the internal evidence, the nature of the 
spirit. It lays emphasis on its indiscerptible char- 
acter. This argument implies more knowledge than 
we have of the nature of spirit, and proves quite 
too much. On the other hand, the author does not 
sufficiently amplify and enforce the moral argument. 
As physical predictions fail us, spiritual predictions 
gain power. The spirit of the book is of the best.

A survivor Colonel Edward Vibart gives an 

of the great extremely interesting account of his 

Indian Mutiny. persona i experiences in India during 
the Mutiny, in his " The Sepoy Mutiny " (imported 
by Scribner). At the time of the outbreak Colonel 
Vibart was a young subaltern in a regiment of na-

the northwest of Delhi. He is now the sole surviving 
officer of that garrison. When the news reached 
the cantonments of the riots in the city following the 
arrival there of the mutinous sepoys from Meerut, 
detachments were sent out to quell the disturbance ; 
but it soon became evident that the native troops 
were disaffected, as they offered no resistance to 
the mutineers, suffering them to murder the Eu- 
ropean officers before their eyes and even joining in 
the bloody work. Colonel Vibart with his regiment 
proceeded to the Cashmere Gate, which they occu- 
pied, and in the fortified enclosure of which he and 
the other European officers presently found them- 
selves entrapped and besieged by a bloodthirsty 
band of native soldiery composed largely of their 
own men, who deserted en masse as soon as free- 
dom of choice between their European masters and 
their revolted fellow-countrymen was clearly offered 
to them. The position of the little group of besieged 
English, whose numbers had been in the meantime 
increased by the addition of several refugees, among 
them four ladies, from Delhi, soon became desper- 
ate. Their place of refuge was a trap, and flight 
was the sole alternative to death and mutilation at 
the hands of the now everywhere victorious muti- 
neers. The escape of Colonel Vibart and his com- 
panions from the Cashmere Gate into the open 
country seems little short of miraculous, and we 
have read few tales of similar adventure more thrill- 
ing than the recital of the subsequent wanderings 
from village to village through a roused and hostile 
country of this little band of fugitives. The sepoys 



were at times hot on their trail and in plain sight 
from their places of hiding, and they were more 
than once in imminent danger of violence at the 
hands of disaffected townspeople. Occasional 
instances of kindness at the hands of compassionate 
natives are grateful to read of ; and but for the 
offices of these dusky good Samaritans whose char- 
itable hands offered the starving and exhausted 
fugitives furtive gifts of milk and chupatties, Colonel 
Vibart and his companions would certainly never 
have lived to tell the tale of their flight from Delhi. 
That tale is told modestly and directly ; and to it is 
added an account of the author's subsequent share in 
the siege of Delhi, and in the operations at Cawn- 
pore and Lucknow. Colonel Vibart saw the dead 
bodies of the three princes summarily slain by 
Hodson, whose action in thus taking the law into 
his own hands he mildly condemns as " a most inju- 
dicious act " ! We should call it plain murder 
essentially a military lynching, and not a whit better 
morally than the sepoy atrocities for which it was a. 
reprisal. There is no evidence whatever that the 
princes shared in the massacre of Europeans in 
Delhi ; and a British officer who, after the siege was- 
over and the victory won, deliberately slew his help- 
less and unresisting prisoners in cold blood and with 
his own hand, simply put himself on a level with 
Nana Sahib, and stained the for the most part glo- 
rious record of the suppression of the Bengal Mu- 
tiny. Colonel Vibart's book contains some interest- 
ing plates, some of them from photographs dating 
back to the period treated. Two supplementary 
chapters, by P. V. Luke and Colonel Mackenzie, 
the one giving the "true version" of the so-called 
" fateful telegram " popularly believed to have saved 
India, the other narrating the particulars of the 
Meerut outbreak, are given ; and there is some 
interesting supplementary matter in the Appendix. 



The German temperate and judicial tone of 

Emperor in M. Maurice Leudet's chatty book, 

private life. "The Emperor of Germany at 

Home " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), is to be commended. 
As a Frenchman, M. Leudet has not forgotten 
Sedan, and he plainly looks forward to a day of 
reckoning with Germany ; but he speaks by no 
means unkindly of the Germans, and not disrepect- 
f ully of their Emperor. To his view William II. 
is an ambitious, somewhat flighty, yet clever and 
versatile young man, who believes that a King's 
business is to be a King, and not the ward of a 
Chancellor or the mandatory of a majority. That 
William is vain, with a pompous, peacock species of 
vanity, that prompts him to sun himself in the 
public eye in raiment of gorgeous hues and infinite 
variety, M. Leudet does not deny ; but he scouts 
the notion that the erratic young ruler is a mere 
empty megalomaniac the neurotic "William the 
Witless " of the more irreverent English journals. 
William's particular bete noire is England; and 
against her he would combine Russia, Germany, and 
France a scheme which M. Leudet regards with

much disfavor. Republican America, with its irrev- 
erent notions of royalty and its habit of jeering at 
the pretensions and theoretical sacrosanctity of 
Consecrated Persons in general, William naturally 
dislikes, regarding her politics and her pork with a 
jealous and hostile eye. To M. de Blowitz he once 
observed : " I fear on one side the danger of a cer- 
tain invading and continued extension with which 
Europe is threatened by one of her races" (the 
English, thinks M. Leudet), "armed with all the 
resources which civilization puts and will put at the 
service of her ambition ; and on the other side I 
fear the intervention of the New World, which is 
beginning to develope appetites from which it has 
been up to now free, and which will before long 
wish to interfere in the affairs of the Old World 
and to meet half way the ambitions, always waking, 
which are stirring around us." The famous tele- 
gram to old Kriiger, and the doings of " Brother 
Henry " at Manila, may be taken as some evidence 
of the sincerity of the above manifesto. All in all, 
the Emperor of Germany appears in M. Leudet's 
pages to be, politically considered, a personage whose 
demise the world in general will in all probability 
regard with an equanimity bordering on satisfaction. 
He is temperamentally a disturbing factor whose 
elimination will make for European stability. M. 
Leudet's book contains a good deal of detailed de- 
scription of the Berlin royal family and manage, 
drawn largely from a recently published German 
book on the successor of Frederick III., by Herr 
Oscar Klaussmann. To show the reader William II. 
in private life is M. Leudet's aim, though political 
questions are pretty freely touched upon through- 
out. Judging from the pictorial display in this book, 
the Emperor has, among other eccentricities, a mania 
for getting himself photographed. 

Fur trading Following "The Journal of Jacob 

on the Upper Fowler," lately issued in the "Amer- 
Missisnppi. ican Explorers Series " (F. P. Har- 

per), we now have " Forty Years a Fur Trader on 
the Upper Missouri," by Charles Larpenteur. The 
author was a Frenchman who made his way direct 
from France to the Upper Missouri in 1833, in the 
palmy days of trapping and fur-trading in the vast 
region extending to the Rocky Mountains ; and in 
this region he remained until his death, in 1872, 
most of the time in the service of the American Fur 
Company. His personal narrative is an admirable 
mirror of the trapping and fur-trading life on both 
its savage and civilized sides, if indeed it can be said 
to have had any civilized side. The selfish and 
cynical indifference of the trappers, traders, and 
companies to the well-being of the Indians, we have 
not seen shown up in a more striking manner. For 
example, in the winter of 1844 Larpenteur was or- 
dered by his superior at Fort Union to take an " out- 
fit " and go a hundred miles northward into the 
British Possessions, to trade with the Cree and 
Chippewa Indians for robes. He and his two com- 
panions suffered from cold and hunger almost unto 



death, but he was successful in his object. He traded 
for two hundred and thirty robes, giving for them 
five gallons of alcohol, on which the camp got twice 
drunk, and some flimsy cloths and trinkets like 
hand looking-glasses. " This ended the business," 
he remarks, " there being no liquor and hardly any 
robes left in camp." The weather was such that a 
mule froze to death standing bolt upright in his 
shelter, while buffalo robes were almost the only 
protection that the savages had against the cold. 
The editor estimates that the percentage of profit 
in the transaction must have been several thousand. 
Very realistic, too, are Larpenteur's pen-pictures of 
the Indian agents he had known, most of whom 
were under the immediate influence of the Amer- 
ican Fur Company, and so incapable of doing the 
Indians justice. He describes them with such pic- 
turesque bits of description as " The greenest of all 
agents I ever saw "; " a great drunkard "; " a 
drunken gambler "; " a drunkard and a gambler "; 
" a jovial old fellow who had a very fine paunch 
for brandy, and when he could not get brandy would 
take almost anything which would make drunk 
come," etc. The book is opportune, coming at a 
time when we are all much borne down with the 
white man's burden. It is edited in Dr. Coues's 
usual skilful manner, and brought out in its pub- 
lisher's usual handsome style. 

A builder of ^ fashionable young man whose de- 

Great Britain's sire for social position was so great as 

colonial policy. to j ead h j m to ab(Juct from boarding . 

school an heiress, and to carry her from the heart 
of England first to Edinburgh and then to France, 
could hardly be expected to develope into a man of 
ability in statecraft. Such, however, was the long 
step taken by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, a short 
account of whose life and labors is now given by 
Mr. R. Garnett in a volume of the series called 
" Builders of Greater Britain " (Longmans). Wake- 
field's aggressive method of conquering matrimonial 
good fortune (and incidentally a seat in Parlia- 
ment) resulted in dismal failure; for the friends 
of the lady soon succeeded in rescuing her, and 
in having the House of Lords by special act set 
aside an irregular marriage cerremony performed in 
Scotland, while the abductor was given a sentence 
of three years' imprisonment in Newgate gaol. 
Parliamentary life was forever closed to Wakefield 
by this incident, but his undeniable genius and 
indomitable enthusiasm resulted in the end in creat- 
ing for him an enviable position as a sort of non- 
oflicial adviser to the crown ministers in charge of 
colonial affairs. How he attained that position, and 
how he used it, are well told by the author, with 
numerous selections from Wakefield's writings and 
private letters. The inclusion of Wakefield in the 
list of colonial " builders " in the present series is a 
surprise, for he alone had no direct agency in con- 
ducting exploration or in expanding English terri- 
tory and control. His work was rather that of the 
theoretician who lays down rules of general policy

A general 
index to the 



and advocates certain lines of expansion. His great 
and enduring fame rests mainly upon the fact that 
to him more than to any other is due the adoption 
by England of her modern colonial policy " to 
let colonies be extensions of England, with the same 
constitution as at home, with their own parliaments 
on the spot, and Governments responsible to them 
under the Queen's Viceroys who connect them with 
her supremacy." This assuredly renders him as 
much a builder of the Empire as the actual organ- 
izer in any particular colony. The author's defense 
of the New Zealand Company, aside from Wake- 
field's connection with it and responsibility for its 
actions, seems non-essential to the purpose of the 
hook. The delineation of his hero's somewhat erratic 
character and the analysis of his labors are given 
with discriminating judgment and with excellent 
summation. 

The " General Index to the Library 
Journal," long demanded by mem- 

Library Journal. berg Q f the pro f ess i on5 has at last 

been published by the American Library Associa- 
tion. It covers the twenty-two years (and volumes) 
from 1876 to 1897, inclusive, and provision is made 
for a manuscript extension by leaving the right half 
of each page blank. There are 130 of these half- 
printed pages, with an average of something over 
fifty entries to the page. Obviously from these 
figures, it is not a minute index such an index 
would have meant a volume six or seven times as 
large as that now published ; nevertheless it affords 
a means of ready reference to everything of im- 
portance in the files of the "Journal." The index 
is chiefly the work of Mr. F. J. Teggart, with the 
assistance of Miss Helen E. Haines, both of whom 
" deprecate having their work compared with the 
ideal library standard of indexing, in view of the 
limitations necessarily imposed upon them in their 
work." A glance over the entries shows Mr. Cutter 
and Mr. Dewey to have been the most frequent con- 
tributors to the "Journal," each of them having about 
a page and a half of references. Mr. Paul L. Ford 
and the late Dr. Poole come next in the number of 
entries given to individual names. The work will 
prove of great value to all libraries, whether or not 
they possess complete sets (now almost unobtain- 
able) of the periodical which is thus indexed. 

Vase paintings Professor John H. Huddilston's re- 
as illustrating cent volume on " The Attitude of the 
Greek tragedy. Qreek Tragedians Toward Art" is 
now followed by " Greek Tragedy in the Light of 
Vase Paintings " (Macmillan), showing the other 
side of the question. As the earlier treatise col- 
lected all the passages in Greek tragedy where the 
poet shows familiarity with the potter's art, so the 
later one attempts to trace the effect of tragedy 
upon conception and treatment of subject by the 
vase decorator. It is interesting to note that Sopho- 
cles, whose dramas contain fewest allusions to pot- 
tery or comparisons drawn from the industry, is 
also, according to Dr. Huddilston's theory, the poet 



An English 



Mirabeau, 



who least influenced the designs of later potters. 
The greater popularity of the works of ^Eschylus 
and Euripides in furnishing subjects for illustration 
he attributes to their greater creative power ; the 
scenes as treated by Sophocles are less original. 
One feels that " Greek Tragedy in the Light of 
Vase Paintings " will have greater interest for ar- 
chaeologists than for students of tragedy, in spite of 
the author's hope, expressed in the preface, that his 
work will appeal to the latter class. More important 
for vase painting than for tragedy is an understand- 
ing of the relation between them. We may think 
that at times Dr. Huddilston has fallen into the 
temptation of assuming parallelism of tragic scene 
and vase painting where none exists, or of attribut- 
ing the frequency of a design to the great popu- 
larity of a poem, when really it was due to the con- 
ventionalizing of a scene by the potters themselves, 
or to their tendency to duplicate patterns. But one 
must appreciate the painstaking scholarship that the 
book represents, and must be grateful for some ad- 
mirable reproductions of Greek vases. Such repro- 
ductions are all too rare, and every fresh addition 
is welcome. _ 

^ n *k e P re f ace to his lucid and tem- 
perate little sketch of Mirabeau in 
the Foreign Statesmen " series 
(Macmillan), Mr. P. F. Willert states that he does 
not know that " much of importance has been 
written in English about Mirabeau, except an essay 
by Macaulay." We beg leave to call Mr. Willert's 
attention to the important volumes treating largely 
and professedly of the public career of the brilliant 
French politician by Professor von Hoist, as a work 
that might possibly lead to certain modifications of 
his own views. In the main, however, Mr. Willert 
is in accord with Professor von Hoist as to Mira- 
beau's course and character and also, let us add, 
in regard to Lafayette, whom he roundly pronounces 
" a prig," a judgment, in our opinion, too severe. 
There was undoubtedly a tinge of self-complacency, 
a hint of the poseur, in the attitude of the knight 
of the " white horse," on grand occasions, that did 
not fail to excite the smiles of watchful contempo- 
raries like Gouverneur Morris, and can hardly be 
charged entirely to the score of race ; but Lafayette 
played altogether too forceful a part in the drama 
of his time to be set down as a mere " prig." His 
foibles were patent ; he failed to see and to seize 
his one grand opportunity of mastering the radical 
movement, when that movement momentarily col- 
lapsed before the determined onset of the Constitu- 
tional party on the day of the " Massacre of the 
Champ de Mars." He is dwarfed in history by the 
proximity of such Titans as Mirabeau and Danton ;. 
but his hands were clean. Mr. Willert has turned 
the continental authorities on Mirabeau to excellent 
account, notably the full and impartial biography 
(" Das Leben Mirabeaus " ) of Professor Alfred 
Stern. The little book may be read through in a 
couple of sittings, and (with the exception noted)' 
it contains the essence of the fuller narratives.

the third of Mr. Alfred Austin s prose 
works, "Lamia's Winter- Quarters " (Macmillan) 
steers skilfully a middle course between all manner 
of faults. There is something in the attitude of 
a poet-laureate seeking distinction in prose which 
is bound to excite adverse criticism ; but it may 
safely be averred that the critics here will belong 
to that larger class who do not read the books they 
animadvert upon. And, for the first time since 
Beowulf and his compeers, it seems to be true that 
there are fewer persons writing really good prose 
in English than there are verse-writers of consider- 
able distinction, making a possible dubbing as prose- 
laureate perhaps the more worthy title of the two. 
In any event, Mr. Austin is now to be congratulated 
on having not only added a third work to the En- 
glish prose classics, but on having invented in the 
first instance a vehicle for the setting of his verses 
which lends both them and the vehicle itself addi- 
tional charms. For in this he retains his original 
dramatis persons, the Poet among them, and from 
his lips fall from time to time lyrics of much charm 
and spontaneity. Indeed, the word " charm " is one 
to be used of the book as a whole : manly men, 
lovely women, an admirable mise en scene, smoothly 
flowing prose, elegant verse, the whole embodied in 
a book having many mechanical beauties, all work- 
ing to that single end. It is a pleasure to note that 
the former volumes, " The Garden that I Love " and 
" In Veronica's Garden," have met with proper 
appreciation in their own country, and it is to be 
hoped that Americans will not deny themselves a 

similar pleasure. _ 

Afternoons Prof essor F. G. Peabody gives to the 

in a college students of Harvard University brief 

chapel. addresses on religious subjects in the 

setting of a beautiful service. A volume of these 
addresses is now published by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. The addresses read well and carry 
out into the wider world the message of the quiet, 
restful, reverential hours of the old chapel. One 
feels as he reads that he is in the company of noble 
spirits who love to talk of high themes and whose 
purpose it is to live true and pure and useful lives. 
The time given is too short for the heavy university 
sermon, weighted with ponderous discussions of 
metaphysics, but long enough to spur young and 
restless students to worthy endeavor. The author 
is master of a charming style, crisp and chaste, well 
suited to fill a small canvas with figures and hints 
without crowding and confusion. 



The lampblack pendulum of biographical writ- 

schooiof ing seems to have reached the limit 

biography. Q f rea ji gm j n tne various "true" 

sketches of American public men now appearing. 
" The True Benjamin Franklin," by Sidney George 
Fisher (Lippincott), is another attempt at this lit- 
erary iconoclasm. A portrait which shows " wart 
and all " may suit a Cromwell and be true to nature ; 



but one which paints the wart and omits the por- 
trait is not true. .Doubtless this mania for realism 
is but a reaction from the heroic drawing of Weems 
and his kin ; but to paint the shadows without the 
high lights is no more fair than to paint the high 
lights without the shadows. To conjure into ille- 
gitimacy the affectionate title of " daughter " given 
by an old man to his friend's child becomes easy 
when one sin in that direction has been committed. 
No one was more keen to his shortcomings than 
Franklin, and no one kept a better calendar of his 
own sins ; but to measure his deeds by our standard 
is as cruel as it is unjust. One waits with bated 
breath the publication of the next attempt at lamp- 
black biography. It may be a " true " life of the 
angel Gabriel. 

"Red Patriots" (The Editor Pub- 
A .plea for lighing Co., Cincinnati) is a tale of 

the Seminoles. i ITT iii 

the oemmole Indians, into which the 
author has put an earnest spirit and a realizing sense 
of the wrongs done this family of red men. The 
usual account of the Seminoles tells of a runaway 
offshoot of the Creek nation, which found a home 
in Florida, and became a menace to the Southerners 
because of predatory excursions, or, more offensive 
yet, established a rendezvous for refugee slaves. 
This notion finds no favor in " Red Patriots." There 
were two sides to every quarrel with the Southern 
Indians, and the facts presented in evidence seem 
to show that more often the white man rather than 
the red was the first offender. The object of the 
present publication is to claim a proper place in 
history for the Seminoles, and especially to do full 
justice to the fame of Osceola, one of the most noted 
of the chiefs. The book is full of references to 
official documents and records, and bears the stamp 
of faithful investigation ; but there is a notable lack 
of literary polish, and the typographical work is as 
wretched as the quality of paper used is inexcus- 
ably poor. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The introductory essay written by Mr. Lewis E. Gates 
for his three volumes of selections from Jeffrey, New- 
man, and Arnold have been detached from the books in 
which they first appeared, and brought together (the 
Jeffrey rewritten and expanded) into an independent 
volume called " Three Studies in Literature " (Mac- 
millan). This is as it should be, for the essays were 
much too good to remain in the semi-obscurity of their 
text-book form, and we are glad once more to commend 
them as striking examples of literary criticism and 
interpretation. The Newman, particularly, is as good 
as anything that has been done upon the subject.

Mr. William Johnson Stone is of those who entertain 
the forlorn hope of naturalizing strictly classical metres 
in English poetry, and he has just published, through 
Mr. Henry Frowde, an argumentative pamphlet in sup- 
port of this view. It is entitled " On the Use of Clas- 
sical Metres in English," and however essentially ques- 
tionable the argument may be, it is urged with much 
force, and, what is better, illustrated by a really beau- 
tiful version of about one hundred lines from the 
Odyssey." 



LITERARY NOTES. 



" The Scapegoat," by Mr. Hall Caine, has just been 
published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. in a new edi- 
tion, which is almost a new book, so extensively has it 
been revised and amended. 

Professor Patrick Geddes, of Edinburgh, will speak 
before the Twentieth Century Club of Chicago on the 
thirtieth of this month. " Schemes and Dreams of a 
Great City " will be the subject of his address. 

Mr. Gosse's " Life and Letters of Dr. John Donne, 
Dean of St. Paul's," upon which he has been long en- 
gaged, will be published soon. The University of St. 
Andrews has just conferred the honorary degree of 
LL.D. on Mr. Gosse. 

The Rev. Andrew Kennedy Hutchinson Boyd, known 
to more readers by his initials than by his name, died 
early this month, at the age of seventy-four. The " Rec- 
reations of a Country Parson " was his best known 
work, although he published many other volumes. 

Something of a new departure is to be made by the 
Turnbull lectures at the Johns Hopkins University. A 
course on Wagner, to be given by Mr. H. S. Chamber- 
lain, has been announced. Dr. Paulsen, of Berlin, will 
give a series of lectures next year at the same Univer- 
sity. 

Dr. Henry Van Dyke, who is now quite definitely 
said to have accepted a professorship of English litera- 
ture at Princeton University, will be the speaker at the 
next convocation of the University of Chicago. The 
date will be April 1 ; and the subject of the address, 
" Democracy and Culture." 

Mr. Chalkley J. Hambleton, of Chicago, has printed 
privately a small volume called " A Gold Hunter's Ex- 
perience." The book is not, as one might expect, an 
account of some recent expedition to the Klondike, but 
rather the story of an expedition made by the author to 
Pike's Peak in 1860, " made up partly from memory 
and partly from old letters written at the time to my 
sister in the East." It is a belated bit of history, but 
none the less interesting for that. 

Two recent numbers of the Johns Hopkins publica- 
tions (Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore) consist of 
studies of slavery in New Jersey by Henry Seofield 
Cooley, and of the causes of the Maryland Revolution 
of 1689 by Francis Edgar Sparks. Rejecting the usual 
statement that this revolution was produced by a few 
ambitious men through a false story of a Roman Cath- 
olic plot, the author of the latter pamphlet traces it to 
an over-development of the strong Palatinate system of 
government during the thirty years preceding. The 
former pamphlet traces the history of slavery in its 
beginnings under proprietary government, its increase 
under the Crown government, and the spread of the 
Quaker abolition feeling until the gradual abolition law 
of 1804. The largest number of slaves at any time 
within the state was about 12,000 in 1800. 

" A Laboratory Manual in Astronomy " (Ginn), by 
Miss Mary E. Byrd, emphasizes the growing apprecia- 
tion of observational and experimental methods in all 
departments of teaching. At first thought, it seems as 
if these methods were beyond the reach of most schools 
and colleges, as far as astronomy is concerned, on ac- 
count of the expensiveness of the equipment necessary, 
to say nothing of the advanced mathematical knowl- 
edge presupposed. Bui the author of this volume 
shows that a great deal may be done with simple means,

and her book fairly justifies its title. We are a little 
suspicious of " home-made telescopes," but there is no 
doubt that many observations and simple calculations 
are within the reach of young students, and afford an 
admirable sort of discipline in scientific thought and 
method. 

DANIEL LEWIS SHOREY. 

Chicago has been singularly unfortunate during the 
last few months in the loss of a number of men repre- 
senting the highest type of intelligent citizenship. 
Within a comparatively brief period, we have had mel- 
ancholy occasion to report the deaths of E. G. Mason, 
J. L. High, L. H. Boutell, and W. K. Sullivan. To 
that list must now be added the name of Daniel Lewis 
Shorey, who died after a two months' illness, on the 
fourth of March, at the age of seventy-five. Mr. Shorey 
will be remembered by our readers as an occasional 
contributor, but there are far more cogent reasons than 
that for recording in these columns a tribute to his mem- 
ory. Few Chicagoans have been so thoroughly identi- 
fied with the higher intellectual life and social aspira- 
tions of the community as was Mr. Shorey, even during 
the busiest years of his professional career; and few have 
left behind them so much good work, accomplished with- 
out ostentation, for the furtherance of culture. He was 
born in Maine, January 31, 1824, and was educated at 
Phillips Andover, Dartmouth, and the Harvard Law 
School. He taught for a few years in New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, and Washington, and was admitted to 
the Massachusetts bar in 1854. The year following, he 
removed to Davenport, Iowa, where he practised for 
ten years, also serving terms as city attorney and pres- 
ident of the school board. In 1865 he came to Chicago, 
and continued in the practice of his profession for 
twenty-five years. When, after the Great Fire, it was 
proposed to establish a public library in Chicago, Mr. 
Shorey took an active interest in the matter, and drafted 
the Illinois statute of 1872, one of the first and best of 
the State laws relating to public libraries. He became 



a member of the first library board organized under this 
law, and occupied that position for eight years. This 
led to his friendship with the late W. F. Poole, one of 
the closest friendships of his life, lasting for twenty 
years. Of the nine members of that first library board, 
Mr. Julius Rosenthal is now the sole survivor. In 1880 
Mr. Shorey became a member of the City Council, serv- 
ing the public in this capacity for six years. In 1890 
he retired from his profession, took a long trip abroad, 
and, returning, settled down to spend his closing years 
in his library. He read widely and deeply in several 
directions, particularly in the history of the French 
Revolution, upon which subject he had made himself an 
authority. His contributions to THE DIAL were among 
the results of these studies. The establishment of the 
University of Chicago soon after his retirement, and his 
appointment as a Trustee of the institution, provided a 
happy outlet for his surplus energies. Living close to 
the University, he visited it almost every day down to 
his last illness, and devoted himself to its interests with 
a zeal that few men in similar positions have time to 
display. It was peculiarly fitting that the funeral ser- 
vices, held on the seventh of this month, should have 
been given a quasi-official character by the participation 
of the University authorities. The tale of his public 
services is not complete without mention of his eighteen 
years' presidency of the Western Unitarian Conference, 
and his lifelong activity in the cause of liberal religion. 
Of Mr. Shorey's character it is difficult to speak ade- 
quately in a few words. No one could know him closely 
without thinking, with Hamlet of Horatio, that he was 

" E'en as just a man 
As e'er my conversation coped withal." 

Preserving throughout his life a youthful freshness of 
feeling, his nature was so genuine, and his integrity so 
absolute, that he won both love and respect in a meas- 
ure beyond most of his fellow-men, and his death leaves, 
to those who knew him intimately, the sense of an irre- 
parable loss, of a void that can never be filled.

NEW PUBLICATIONS. 



MUNICIPAL MONOPOLIES. 

By EDWARD W. BEMIS, JOHN R. COMMONS, FRANK PARSONS, M. N. BAKER, F. A. C. PERRINE, MAX WEST. One 
vol., 691 pp., appendices, index. Cloth, $2.00. (Vol. XVI. Crowell's Library of Economics and Politics.) 
This book deserves to be read by every intelligent citizen, and it will not fail to add to the ever-increasing 
demand for a wiser and better management of our public affairs. The work is amply provided with statistical ap- 
pendices and has an excellent index. 

I; IV CONTEMPORARY FRENCH NOVELISTS. : 

By RENE DOUMIC. Translated by Mary D. Frost. One vol., 402 pp., portraits. $2.00. 

The authors whom M. Doumic selected as representative not only of modern French fiction but also of his 
own best work in criticism are : Octave Feuillet, the Goncourt Brothers, Emile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Paul 
Bourget, Guy de Maupassant, Pierre Loti, Edouard Rod, J. H. Rosny, Paul Hervieu, J. K. Huysmans, Re'nd Bazin. 

The translation by Miss Frost is smooth and accurate and preserves much of the beauty of the original. It 
is one of the most important of recent contributions to the study of literature. 

.;'.. HOW COUNT TOLSTOY LIVES AND WORKS. 

Translated from the Russian of P. A. SERGYEENKO by Isabel F. Hapgood. One vol., 8vo, cloth, gilt top, 100 pp. 

4 photogravure illustrations. $1.25. 

The author first knew Tolstoy in 1892, and, having from that time come into intimate relations with the 
family, both at Moscow and also at the Count's country estate at Yasnaya Polyana, he is qualified to give a fair 
and accurate account of the great writer's daily habits. He pictures in a simple and vivid style. 

The illustrations are of great interest and are here for the first time published for American readers. 

BETWEEN CyESAR AND JESUS. 

By GEORGE D. HERRON, D.D. One vol, 16mo, 276 pp., cloth, 75 cents; paper, 40 cents. 

This volume contains a series of eight remarkable lectures delivered in Chicago before crowded and enthu- 
siastic audiences. The work is designed to show the relation of the Christian conscience to the economic problem 
and the social system. 

These lectures have stirred the West as if they were the utterances of a prophet, and even those who were 
compelled to dissent from Dr. Herron's extreme views have been filled with admiration for his lofty spirit, his 
tremendous zeal, his chivalrous presentation of what he considers the burning truth. 

ANCIENT HISTORY. ".'.'.','." 

By VICTOR DURUY. Revised and edited by Prof. Edwin A. Grosvenor. One vol., 12mo, 192 pp. ; maps and plans, 

index. $1.00. 

In addition to its claim upon the general reader, this volume affords an admirable text-book in preparation 
for college. It imparts ample information to answer the requirements of a college entrance examination in Greek 
and Roman history, and bestows that information in a manner that is never dull. The practical value of this 
English version is largely increased by a plentiful supply of maps. 

CONTEMPORARY HISTORY. 

By EDWIN A. GROSVENOR, Professor in Amherst College. One vol., 12mo, cloth, 183 pp., 5 maps ; index. $1.00. 

This book attempts to outline the most prominent political events in Europe and North America during the 
last fifty years. 

Neither in perspicacity, brilliance of style, skill of generalization nor wisdom of selection is there any fault 
to be found with Professor Grosvenor's work, and the general reader and the student will find a surprisingly full 
marshalling of facts, in spite of necessary terseness. The book fills a genuine want and cannot fail to have a wide 
popularity. It has excellent maps and a comprehensive index.

WEBSTER'S INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY. 

QUALITY RATHER THAN QUANTITY. 

Pres. Eliot of Harvard, says : " The International is a wonderfully compact storehouse of accurate information." 



The International is Scientific 
and Practical. 

Words are easily found. Pronunciation is easily ascer- 
tained. Meanings are easily learned. The growth of 
words is easily learned, and excellence of quality rather 
than excess of quantity characterizes its every depart- 
ment. 



It is the School=Teacher of

Composition and Rhetoric 

FOR USE IN SCHOOLS, 
By ROBERT HERRICK, A.B., 

Assistant Professor of English, University of Chicago, 

AND 

LINDSAY TODD DAMON, A.B., 

Instructor in English, University of Chicago. 



This book has three distinct features : 

FIRST It provides material for a two years' course 
of study. 

SECOND The authors believe that the developement 
of the pupil's ideas is of the first importance and 
therefore the material contained in Part I. is intended 
to lead him to express thought freely and naturally 
and for the time being disregards formal Rhetoric. 

THIRD The body of exercises far outweighs the ma- 
terial of the text proper because the authors believe 
that in the first years of training in composition, 
example and practice are far more important than 
precept.

A Weekly Library for Five Cents a Week 

"PUBLIC OPINION," writes an enthusiastic admirer, "is a weekly library 
brought to my own door for five cents a week." "The present," says another, "is 
the busiest of all ages, and compression, condensation, and sifting, the most blessed 
of all services, and these services are rendered by PUBLIC OPINION as by no 
other instrumentality."

If I took no other paper, PUBLIC OPINION would still keep me abreast of the times. 

If I took one hundred periodicals I should still want PUBLIC OPINION. 

When it reaches my table every one of the other twenty papers to which I subscribe must give way to it. 

It is the only single publication issued in the world which keeps its readers fully abreast of the times, week 
by week. 

My wife, too, finds it exactly suited to her odds and ends of time, and so she keeps up with the day. 

A Washington man under date of December 3, writes: 

"I don't know what I would do without PUBLIC OPINION. If I could not get it otherwise, I 
would dispense with butter on my bread in order to have its weekly visits. I am too busy a 
man to wade through the modern daily papers. In PUBLIC OPINION 1 get the cream of comment 
without the blue milk of sensation."

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



HERBERT S. STONE & COMPANY 

ELDRIDQE COURT CHICAGO 



BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE SOWERS. 1 



With Twenty Eight 

Full-Page Illustrations. 



12mo, Cloth, About 400 

Pages. Price, $1.75. 



By HENRY SETON MERRIMAN, 

Author of With Edge Tools," " In Kedar's Tents," " Roden's Corner," etc. 

Mr. Merriman's success has been steadily growing since the publication of " The Sowers." This new novel has 
not been published serially in this country, and will, therefore, come to the public with absolute freshness. Except 
for "Dross "the proofs of which he has just finished reading there will be no other book by Mr. Merriman this year. 



" After-Supper Songs." 

By ELIZABETH COOLIDGE. With twenty-four medal- 
lions in colors. Quarto, cloth, $2.00. 

This volume of songs for children was issued the week before Christ- 
mas, and was not, therefore, sold at any except the Chicago bookstores. 
The entire first edition was sold during the week. No better evidence 
could be given of the selling qualities of the work. 

"The History of Gambling in England." 

By JOHN ASHTON. 8vo, cloth, 82.50. 

Mr. Ashton has made an extremely interesting volume on this sub- 
ject. He describes the origin of gambling in England ; the different 
games of chance and how they are played ; and tells hundreds of 
amusing anecdotes about celebrated gamblers. 

'The Cougar - Tamer, and Other Stories of Ad- 
venture." 

By FRANK WELLES CALKINS. With seven full-page 
illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The book is made up of fifteen stories of adventure in the West. 
They originally appeared in the Youth 1 * Companion, where they were 
featured as one of the best series of stories of adventure that the pub- 
lication bad ever printed. 

The illustrations by Jay Hanbridge, Emerson, and others are 
admirable. 

"The Perfect Wagnerite." 

By G. BERNARD SHAW, author of "Plays Pleasant and 

Unpleasant." 12mo, $1.25. 

The author's preface explains the work. " This is a commentary on 
' The Ring of the Niblungs.' I offer it to those enthusiastic admirers of 
Wagner who are unable to follow his ideas ; although they are unable to 
follow his ideas, and do not understand in the least the dilemma of 
Wotan, though they are filled with indignation at the irreverence of the 
Philistines, who frankly aver that they find the remarks of the god too 
often tedious and nonsensical." 

"A Short History of the United States." 

By JUSTIN HUNTLY MCCARTHY. With a complete 

Index. 12mo, $1.50. 

A history of the United States from the standpoint of an English- 
man will prove interesting at this time, when there is so much talk of 
an Anglo-American alliance. The author has not attempted to defend 
England in her relations with this country, but tells in an impartial 
manner the plain story of America's development. 

"Love's Dilemmas." 

By ROBERT HERRICK. Six Short Stories, only one of 
which has been printed before. With a cover designed 
by WILL BRADLEY. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 
The stories are all significant. They mean something, they have a 
perceptible relation to life. Mr. Herrick is so thoughtful a student of 
character that his strokes count. You may dislike his idea, you may 
even quarrel with it ; but it makes you think. Behind it you feel a cer- 
tain insight into motives and emotions, into the problem of the trans- 
mutation of character into action. It is not an infallible insight, but it 
is keen. And its edge is almost as sharp in dealing with these light 
themes as with the prof ounder difficulties of " The Gospel of Freedom. " 

" Ickery Ann, and Other Girls and Boys." 

By ELIA W. PEATTIE, author of " A Mountain Wo- 
man," " The Shape of Fear," etc. With a cover design 
by FRANK HAZENPLUG. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
Mrs. Peattie has collected a number of her stories for children from 
the Youth's Companion, St. Nicholas, etc., and they are now issued in 
attractive book form. The author's reputation is steadily and speedily 
growing, and these stories will be found not only worthy of her name, 
but notable as forming her first volume for children. 



"D'Arcy of the Guards" or "The Fortunes of 
War." 

By Louis EVAN SHIPMAN, author of " Urban Dia- 

logues." 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

A rollicking, cheerful story, with an Irish hero and an American 
heroine. The action takes place on the highway near London, in Lon- 
don, and in Philadelphia in colonial times. Mr. Shipman has written 
with evident enjoyment, and has given to his style much of gaiety and 
wit. In its climax, however, it rises to a real, dramatic situation, at 
which the reader cannot fail to feel a thrill of excitement. It is a quick- 
reading book, and one which will be difficult to lay aside without 
finishing. 

"The Wolf's Long Howl." 

By STANLEY WATERLOO, author of "The Story of 
Ab," etc." Uniform with "A Man and a Woman." 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The great success of the " Story of Ab " has encouraged the pub- 
lishers to put into book form some of the best of Mr. Waterloo's short 
stories. Several of them have appeared in English and American peri- 
odicals, but the majority are now printed for the first time. 

" A Fair Brigand." 

By GEORGE HORTON, author of " Aphroessa," " Con- 

stantino," etc., late U. S. Consul at Athens. With 

many illustrations. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 

Mr. Horton has written an amusing, and at times exciting, tale of 

adventure among the brigands who inhabit the country around Mt. 

Olympus, and he has incidentally given what is probably the only 

truthful picture that has been written of life in modern Greece. Takis, 

the celebrated Greek brigand, who was tried in Athens just before the 

Greek-Turkish war, on the charge of cutting off the ears of his cap- 

tives, is one of the leading characters in the book. In the closing 

scenes in Athens, many well-known persons are introduced under a 

thin disguise of romance. 

" Robert, Earl Nugent." 

By CLAUD NUGENT. With many reproductions in 
photogravure and half-tone from family portraits by Sir 
Godfrey Kneller, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, 
and others. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

" Successful Houses." 

By OLIVER COLEMAN. Finely illustrated. 8vo, cloth, 

$1.50. 

Every room in the house is taken up in the book and methods of 
treatment suggested. Mr. Coleman's articles have been widely read in 
The, House Beautiful, and it is safe to say that no book on Interior 
Decoration has ever been published which is so practical and so com- 
pletely governed by the requirements of good taste. Many half-tone 
illustrations of interiors accompany the text. 

"Lucifer: A Theological Tragedy." 

By GEORGE SANTAYANA. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 



Mr. Santayana's volume of " Sonnets and Other Poems," published 




together with the entire play, and should appeal largely to thoughtful 
readers. 

" Etiquette for Americans." 

Second impression. 16mo, cloth, $1.25. 
It is probable that no woman thoroughly qualified to write upon this 
subject would be willing to sign her name to this book. It is written by 
a person who is regarded all over the country as an authority upon this 
subject. Matters of good form are so constantly changing that there is 
at present a great need for such a book.

HERBERT S. STONE & COMPANY 

ELDRIDQE COURT CHICAGO 



"The Carcellini Emerald." 

With Other Tales by Mrs. BURTON HARRISON. Illus- 
trated. 12mo. cloth, $1.50. 
Mrs. Harrison has gathered six of her best stories into a volume 

which is illustrated by some of our foremost artists. The book is likely 

to be widely popular. 

"Can We Disarm?" 

By JOSEPH McCABE, in collaboration -with GEORGES 
DARIEN, author of " Biribi." 12mo, $1.25. 
A very timely book on a subject of universal interest. The authors 
have brought together and arranged the arguments on both sides of the 
question, and have offered a plan that might be generally satisfactory 
to the powers. The arguments are carefully substantiated from the 
latest statistics. 

"The Spanish - American War." 

By Eye Witnesses. Fully illustrated. 8vo, cloth, $1.50. 
This volume represents a unique method of giving the history of 
the present war with Spain. Arrangements were made with corre- 
spondents at the front to furnish stories of the battles from the point 
of view of the non-combatant. Valuable photographs and drawings of 
the different battles in progress have been secured and reproduced in 
this volume. So far as is known, this is the only occasion upon which 
the history of a war has been recorded in this fashion. 

"The Vengeance of the Female." 

By MARRION WILCOX, author of "A Short History of 
the War with Spain," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
Mr. Wilcox has written a book for persons of leisure. It is a ram- 
bling account of experiences and characters he has had to do with in 
several parts of the globe. He does not seek to explain or to instruct 
or even to suggest insistently. His observations of the life he has 
shared in Spain and Italy were written down because they seemed es- 
sential, it is true ; but entertainment is essential now and then. 



"Sand 'n' Bushes." 

By MARIA LOUISE POOL. Uniform with " A Golden 

Sorrow." 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. have been so fortunate as to secure 
another novel by Miss Pool, and to all the readers of "In Buncombe 
County " and " In a Dyke Shanty " the announcement will be of espe- 
cial interest. The new book is characterized by all the humor and 
keenness of description that have made Miss Pool's previous work 
famous. 

"The Awakening." 

By KATE CHOPIN, author of " A Night in Acadie," 
" Bayou Folks," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
Mrs. Chopin has written a very remarkable novel, which is likely to 
occasion considerable sensation. It is essentially a story for women ; 
it tells the intimate life the mental, emotional, and moral develop- 
ment of one woman in such a way that its appeal is very large. The 
style is curiously analytical and feminine, and yet of such force as to 
make the final scene very effective. 

"Stories from the Old Testament for Children." 

By HARRIET S. B. BEALE. 12mo, $1.50. ' 

Although many books have already been written upon this subject, 
the present volume will be read because it contains merely the story of 
the Old Testament without the "preaching" which is inevitably to be 
found in such books. The author has told the story simply and leaves 
the moral to be deducted by the reader. 

"Some Verses." 

By HELEN HAY. Second impression. 16mo, cloth, 

$1.00. 

For three or four years Miss Hay's poems have been appearing in 
the various magazines and have attracted the attention from critical 
persons which their real cleverness deserves. They are now collected 
under an unpretentious title and offered to the public simultaneously 
with their author's return to America. 



THE VICTORIAN ERA SERIES. 



The series is designed to form a record of the great move- 
ments and developments of the age, in politics, economics, re- 
ligion, industry, literature, science and art, and of the life 
work of its typical and influential men. 

The individual volumes are contributed by leading special- 
ists in the various branches of knowledge which fall to be 
treated in the series. 

The volumes issued to date have been accepted on all hands 
as authoritative on the subjects with which they deal. They 
are handsomely bound in cloth, with good paper and large 
type, suitable for the library. Price, $1.25 per volume.

BLUE CLOTH BOOKS. 



A series of 16mo books, bound in blue cloth with a design 
in white ink and lining papers from drawings by Mr. Frank 
H. Hazenplng. 

The books are especially intended for summer reading. 

"The Maid He Married." 

By HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD, author of " Pris- 
cilla's Love Story," etc. l(5mo, 75 cents. 
A simple, pretty story of the kind that made Mrs. Spofford famous. 
It is in no sense radical, but is certain to prove interesting reading to a 
large public. 

"Oliver Iverson, His Adventures During Four 
Days and Nights in the City of New 
York in April of the Year 1890." 

By ANN DEVOORE. 16mo, cloth, with a frontispiece by 

Cecil Clark, 75 cents. 

Miss Deyoore is a new writer, and one destined to become well 
known. This novelette is written with great charm of style and no 
little force ; it constantly reminds one of Stevenson's " New Arabian 
Nights," and yet is wholly original and ingenious. 



"A June Romance." 

By NORMAN GALE. 16mo, 75 cents. 

For three years Mr. Gale's charming little story has been out of 
print ; it has now been set up especially for this edition. It has the ad- 
vantage, from the publisher's point of view, of selling three copies to 
every reader, so acceptable is it found as a gift-book. 

"A Little Legacy, and Other Stories." 

By Mrs. L. B. WALFORD. 16mo, 75 cents. 

Mrs. Walford has gathered together several of her best short stories 
in a little volume in the series of " Blue Cloth Books." Her popularity 
is well known, and, brought out in this attractive form, the volume 
should meet with no little success. 

" A Heaven-Kissing Hill." 

By JULIA MAGRUDER, author of " Miss Ayr of Vir- 
ginia," " A Realized Ideal," etc. 16mo, cloth, with a 
frontispiece by Blanche Ostertag, 75 cents. 
Miss Magruder needs no introduction to the public. Her previous 
books have been so well received that the publishers are happy in of- 
fering a new one. This story first appeared in the Ladies' Home Jour- 
nal, where it attracted a great deal of attention. It has to do with the 
love of a prominent beauty in New York society.

roprietors who in 1861 purchased the Spectator have since that 
date conducted it themselves. They are therefore exempted from 
many influences which press severely on the independence of jour- 
nalism, and have from the first made it their chief object to say out 
what they believe to be truth in theology, politics, and social questions, 
irrespective, not only of opposition from without, but of the opinion of 
their own supporters. Their object is to reflect the opinion of cultivated 
Liberals, but in the matter of the American War they fought against 
the mass of the very class they are trying to represent, and were finally 
acknowledged by them to have been in the right. 

The news of the current week is compressed into an animated nar- 
rative, which the laziest or busiest may read, without missing the life 
or import of the events. 

The Spectator contains a list of all Books published during the week 
(not under one shilling in price), with the names of the publishers and 
the prices attached, a feature which will greatly increase its value to 
booksellers, librarians, literary institutions, and private gentlemen.

citizenship. In the effort to do this in the clearest and most logical 
form, the author has developed the general principles of civil gov-

instead of pursuing the usual stereotyped method of giving a running 
commentary upon the Constitution. Progressive Teachers will rec-

THE BEACON BIOGRAPHIES 



M. A. DEWOLFE HOWE, Editor 



Messrs. SMALL, MAYNABD AND COMPANY beg to announce that they will publish on 
April 15 the first five volumes of THE BEACON BIOGRAPHIES, as follows: 
PHILLIPS BROOKS, by the Editor 
DAVID Q. FARRAQUT, by JAMES BARNES 
ROBERT E. LEE, by W. P. TRENT 

JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, by EDWARD EVERETT HALE, JR. 
DANIEL WEBSTER, by NORMAN HAPQOOD 

They are also able to announce the following volumes as in preparation : 
JOHN JAMES AUDUBON, by JOHN BURROUGHS 
EDWIN BOOTH, by CHARLES TOWNSEND COPELAND 
AARON BURR, by HENRY CHILDS MERWIN 
JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, by W. B. SHUBRICK CLYMER 
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, by LINDSAY SWIFT 

The reasons which have persuaded the Editor and the Publishers to believe that 
The Beacon Biographies make their appeal to a fairly general public are these : 

The Beacon Biographies, it is thought, are the most beautiful small books ever issued 
in this country. The cover (in blind and gold on blue cloth) is by Mr. BERTRAM GROS- 
VENOR GOODHUE, who has done also the standing title-page for the series, which has been 
engraved on copper. The size is 24mo (3f by 5^ inches), with an average of 140 pages to 
the volume. The frontispiece portrait which accompanies each is in photogravure. The 
paper has been selected with great care, and the type used is a new face specially cut. 

The subjects of the various Biographies as they appear are to be men of the most vari- 
ous significance in American life, so that the series as completed will give biographically 
the history of American life and character in all its important phases. 

The normal extent of a Beacon Biography is around 20,000 words. Sixty or seventy 
years ago books of American biography thus briefly expressed could be obtained generally 
throughout the country, but they have since been crowded out by the longer Memoirs and 
formal Lives. From these, now, and from the wealth of related material which has been 
accumulated in the research of a generation, it is proposed to condense once more the brief 
statement of essential facts which alone can appeal to the busy American interested in his 
country's history. 

The writers who have consented to contribute to the Series are uniformly men who 
have the point of view of the present generation. With full critical and historical knowl- 
edge of the subjects of which they treat, they have not found it necessary to produce dull 
books, or books without the proper popular appeal. Those who care for biography will 
find in The Beacon Biographies, it is hoped, the solution of a real want books at once 
entertaining, brief, and authentic. Each volume, moreover, is to include a bibliography for 
further reading, and a strict and full list of important dates in chronological order.

facsimiles of important documents. 2 vols., 8vo, 

$6.00. 

The life of Lincoln's great War Secretary, written 
with the aid of Stanton's family. Stanton was, perhaps, 
next to President Lincoln and General Grant, the most 
important figure in the war for the Union. Mr. Gorbam 
has told the story of his career with much power, and 
his book is a work of notable value as a contribution to 
the history of the Civil War and as a memorial of Stan- 
ton's great public services. 

Papias and His Contemporaries. 

A Study of Religious Thought in the Second Cen- 
tury. By Rev. EDWARD H. HALL. 12mo, $1.25. 
A book of great value for students of the first centuries 
of the Christian faith. Mr. Hall uses Papias to show 
the method and spirit of early Christianity. He ex- 
amines the Fathers from St. Peter Ignatius, Jerome, 
Marcion, Valentine down to the third century, re- 
viewing their works and influence. His treatment of 
the Millennium, the Divinity of Christ, and the other 
topics which come within his survey is careful, candid, 
and worthy of most respectful consideration. His book 
is a contribution of real importance to our knowledge 
of an era which holds a significant and mysterious place 
in the history of Christianity. 



The Conjure Woman. 

By CHARLES W. CHESNUTT. 16mo, $1.25. De Luxe 

Edition, a beautiful book. $3.00, net. 

Mr. Chesnutt, who is perfectly acquainted with negro 
superstitions and dialect, here groups several stories of 
peculiar interest. He has caught the indescribable 
Ethiopian, mystic quality in the negro mind, and has 
embodied it in stories vigorous, vivid, and strikingly 
dramatic. The story-teller is Uncle Julius, who has 
much of the genius of Uncle Remus.

Mr. George Ripley, the eminent literary critic of the 

N. Y. Tribune, when this book was first published, said: 

" The point of view in which the present work assumes an exceeding 

interest is that of the portraiture of a rare and noble woman rather 

than of a critical estimate of an illustrious dramatic artist."

A. CON AN DOYLE'S NEW NOVEL. 

A DUET WITH AN OCCASIONAL CHORUS. 

By A. CONAN DOYLE, author of " Uncle Bernac," " Briga- 
dier Gerard," "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes," 
" Round the Red Lamp," etc. Uniform with other books 
by Dr. Doyle. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Dr. Doyle shows a new phase of his fine talent in this book. As a 
story of wedded love it has an idyllic character which will appeal to 
every reader not devoid of healthy sentiment. As an adroit interpre- 
tation of a true philosophy of wedded life the story contains illustrations 
and pithy sayings which will enlist the interest of women and men 
alike. As a story pure and simple the play of motives, contrast of char- 
acters, unexpected incidents, delightful humor, and sustained interest 
will be certain to increase the large company of the author's friends. 

It should be noted that the author has sacrificed his serial rights for 
the sake of presenting his complete story to the public for the first time 
in book form.

THE MORMON PROPHET. 

By LILY DOUGALL, author of "The Mermaid," "The Ma- 
donna of a Day," and "The Zeit-Geist." 12mo, cloth, 
$1.50. 

This remarkable historical novel depicts the actual beginnings of 
Mormonism, the character of the first " revelations " and of those who 
accepted them, and the extraordinary experiences and persecutions of 
the early members of the sect. Merely as a story of strange happenings 
and adventures this novel would enlist the interest of readers, but it 
has also as really its chief reason for being, the value attaching to its 
portraiture of the character of Joseph Smith. In these pages the pecu- 
liar temperament of the "Prophet," the founder of the sect, is placed 
before readers in a manner which will open to them an unknown chap- 
ter in our history. 

THE CRUISE OF THE CACHALOT. 

Round the World after Sperm Whales. By FRANK T. 

BULLEN, First Mate. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" It is immense there is no other word. I ' ve never read anything 
that equals it in its deep-sea wonder and mystery, nor do I think that 
any book before has go completely covered the whole business of whale- 
fishing, and at the same time given such real and new sea pictures. I 
congratulate you most heartily. It 's a new world that you 've opened 
the door to." RUDYARD KIPLING. 

WINDYHAUGH. 

A Novel. By GRAHAM TRAVERS, author of " Mona Mac- 
lean, Medical Student," " Fellow Travellers," etc. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

" The author draws her characters with the clever strokes of the 
successful artist, and the life of her heroine is, in and of itself, so 
immensely interesting that the story never for a moment palls. . . . 
Aside from its moral and intellectual charm, 'Windyhaugh ' is brightly 
written, and has that keen sense of enjoyment which belongs to any 
genuine delineation of life." Boston Herald. 

LOVE AMONG THE LIONS. 

By F. ANSTEY, author of "Vice Versa," etc. 12mo, cloth. 
This delicious little comedy is a happy illustration of the unexpected 
turns of Anstey's quaint humor. The plot must be discovered by the 
reader and not betrayed prematurely. The illustrations are in har- 
mony with the text. The novelette represents Anstey at his best, and 
it will be found an excellent promoter of good spirits. 

THE SCAPEGOAT. 

A Romance and a Parable. By HALL CAINE, author of " The 
Christian," "The Manxman," "The Deemster," "The 
Bondman," etc. New and revised edition. Uniform with 
the author's works. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
This new edition will present itself as practically a new book. It 
will be found to differ materially from the edition heretofore published, 
which was issued some years since without the benefit of the author s 
revision. This powerful romance and expressive "parable" will be 
certain to obtain a greatly enlarged meed of popularity.

NE WSPAPER SCIENCE. 

Walter Bagehot, in one of his letters, speaks 
of somebody's books as containing " a pale 
whitey-brown substance, which people who don't 
think take for thought, but it is n't." All of 
us who do much miscellaneous reading in cur- 
rent literature corne to be painfully familiar 
with the substance thus described, and to won- 
der, on the one hand, how it can be evolved 
from minds that seem to work normally in the 
everyday relations of life, and, on the other, 
how it can prove acceptable to the mental pal- 
ate of so many readers, for many readers there 
must be to account for its voluminous and con- 
tinued production. Such an account of the 
vagaries of intellection as is given by Mr. John 
Fiske, in his recent " Atlantic " article upon 
various kinds of " cranks," is an amusing thing 
to read, of course, but in another aspect an 
aspect that persists in the field of vision after 
the humorous one has faded its effect is sad- 
dening, almost disheartening. Cling as tena- 
ciously as we may to a belief in the essential 
rationality of the human intellect, our faith 
suffers many a rude shock when we see one 
form after another of irrationalism sweeping 
over the public mind, threatening almost to its 
foundations the empire of logic. Illustrations 
of this power of the irrational to set intellects 
awry abound on every hand, and may be drawn 
alike from great things and from small. The 
irrationality of imagining that our conduct as 
a nation toward the people of the Philippine 
Islands can be made to square with the prin- 
ciples upon which we have hitherto shaped our 
national life and carved out our success is of a 
piece with the irrationality that claims next 
year for the first of a new century instead of 
the last of an old one. The former is a matter 
of grave import to countless millions of people ; 
the latter is a belated bit of scholasticism ; both, 
to the psychologist, are interesting examples 
of the way in which pure reason gets flouted 
when it runs counter either to a passion or a 
whim. 

There was a time, not very long ago, when 
we hoped great things from our rapidly expand- 
ing schemes of education, which were to make 



234 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



for rationality in so many ways. The teaching 
of science, particularly, was to raise up a new 
generation with a new mental habit. The 
preachers of this gospel said that all our intel- 
lectual ailments proceeded from the fatal defect 
in educational methods that made words rather 
than things the chief object of attention. Some- 
thing analogous to the degeneracy of inbreed- 
ing was the consequence of the manner in which 
each new generation was content to deal mainly 
with the merely verbal inheritance of the past, 
instead of benefitting by a vivifying contact 
with the concrete facts of nature. Science was 
to change all this, to keep men in constant 
touch with life, leaving the dead past to bury 
its dead, and henceforth to base all our convic- 
tions upon the solid foundations of observation 
instead of the uncertain indications of author- 
ity. Well, science has had pretty much its own 
way in education for the past quarter-century, 
yet the generation that it has helped to train 
seems hardly less prone to superstition than 
were those that preceded. Such mockeries 
of the scientific spirit as parade under the 
names of palmistry and psychical research and 
"Christian " science, and countless other man- 
ifestations of the unregulated intellect, rear 
their heads unabashed, and bear witness to 
the persistence of the irrational even under 
conditions that would seem the most adverse 
to the prosperity of such aberrations of the 
intelligence. 

This flourishing of the unscientific in what is 
commonly supposed to be peculiarly the age of 
science is doubtless the result of instincts too 
deeply seated in the human consciousness to be 
readily accessible to the appeal of educational 
and other rationalizing influences. Yet we can- 
not wholly acquit these influences themselves of 
all responsibility for a state of things so dis- 
creditable to human intelligence. Our educa- 
tional methods must somehow be defective, 
must fail in seriousness of application if not in 
grasp of the problem to be coped with, while 
those ancillary agencies upon which education 
has a right to count seem to be far removed 
indeed from any adequate realization of their 
high mission. While the church, and the polit- 
ical party, and the industrial organization, and 
the publisher of books, and the various kinds 
of purveyors of entertainment to the commu- 
nity, are all in part answerable for this failure 
to realize the opportunities offered them to con- 
tribute to intellectual advancement, the most 
conspicuous offender in this respect is that type 



of the modern newspaper, far too frequently 
met with, which panders to the lower intellec- 
tual instincts quite as noticeably as to the lower 
social and moral instincts of its readers. We 
wish to emphasize this distinction just at present 
because, although many voices have been raised 
to protest against the low moral tone of the 
greater part of contemporary journalism, the 
fact that its intellectual tone is equally low has 
failed to attract the attention due it as a com- 
mentary upon our boasted success in carrying 
on the work of popular education. 

Mr. J. L. Lamed, speaking before the libra- 
rians at Cleveland two or three years ago, made 
use of these impressive and well-weighed words : 

" The common school, making possible readers, and 
the newspaper inviting them to read, arrived together at 
a conjunction which might have seemed to be a happy 
miracle for the universalizing of culture in the western 
world. The opportunity which came then into the hands 
of the conductors of the news press, with the new powers 
that had been given them, has never been paralleled in 
human history. They might have been gardeners of 
Eden and planters of a new paradise on the earth, for 
its civilization was put into their hands to be made what 
they would have it to be. If it could have been possible 
then to deal with newspapers as other educational agen- 
cies are dealt with; to invest them with definite moral 
responsibilities to the public; to take away from them 
their commercial origin and their mercenary motive; to 
inspire them with disinterested aims; to endow them as 
colleges are endowed; to man them for their work as 
colleges are manned, with learning and tried capacity in 
the editorial chairs if that could have been possible, 
what imaginable degree of common culture might not 
Europe and America by this time be approaching ? As 
it is, we are to-day disputing and striving to explain to 
one another a condition of society which shames all who 
think of it." 

We know now that these things were not pos- 
sible, although we believe that they may yet 
become possible, and it is just because we hold 
this belief that it seems important to empha- 
size as frequently and as sharply as we may 
the contrast between what our newspapers are 
doing for education in the true sense and what 
they might so easily take it upon themselves to 
do. And in saying these hard truths of a per- 
verted newspaper press, we wish to give the 
frankest recognition to those journals, found 
here and there, whose aims, both intellectual 
and moral, are entirely creditable to their pub- 
lishers, and which are particularly instructive 
because they indicate the course that others 
might take to the immense benefit of their 
prestige, and not impossibly also to the benefit 
of their subscription and advertising accounts. 
While it is true that some of the greatest com- 
mercial successes in American journalism have 



1899.] 



THE DIAJL

been gained by newspapers of the most debased 
and ruffianly description, it is also true that 
the most dignified examples of our journalism 
have proved, if not the most successful, at least 
successful enough to gratify any reasonable 
ambition. The choice by no means lies between 
success at the price of decency and failure with 
the preservation of self-respect. 

In order to provide some sort of justification 
for the title given to these remarks, we must 
turn from the foregoing abstract considerations 
to something in the nature of concrete illustra- 
tion. We all know that " newspaper science " 
is a term of reproach, and the reason is not far 
to seek. The same spirit of sensationalism that 
leads to the detailed chronicling of a prize fight 
or a criminal trial leads also to the exploitation 
of every sort of mental vagary that cloaks itself 
with the respectable name of science. Whether 
it be a belated alchemist who claims to have 
discovered the stone of the philosophers, or an 
exponent of the newest and most extravagant 
occultism, whether it be a palmist or a " mind- 
reader " or a "faith- healer," whether it be a 
Shaconian or a circle-squarer or a pyramid en- 
thusiast or a direful prophet with a tale of the 
coming destruction of the world, there is no per- 
son so scientifically impossible that he cannot get 
into the newspapers, and enlist their services in 
the propaganda of his pet eccentricity or insane 
delusion. He can get himself taken seriously, 
or at least serni-seriously, and that is what he 
wants. For all such persons notoriety is the 
very breath of life, and the newspapers provide 
it without scruple, because in so doing they can 
at the same time provide the weak-minded sec- 
tion of their readers with a new variety of 
mental dissipation. The most incredible inan- 
ities, the most preposterous notions, the most 
meaningless pseudo-science are thus given a 
currency that is denied even to the genuine 
achievements of investigation. 

This work is done, moreover, in so blunder- 
ing and hap-hazard a way that the spirit of 
sensationalism is not enough completely to ac- 
count for it. There is usually in addition some 
admixture of an ignorance so dense that one 
can only marvel at the number of essentially 
uneducated people who by some mysterious 
dispensation get their lucubrations into print. 
We recall a newspaper article published in 
Chicago some years ago which undertook to 
instruct a confiding public upon the subject of 
ozone. The account was a brief one, but it 
contrived to include statements to the effect that 



the true nature of ozone was not fully under- 
stood, that it got its name " from the peculiar 
odor, which resembles that produced when a 
succession of electric sparks are passed through 
the air," that Faraday considered it " identical 
with the medicinal quality in electricity," that 
the effect of inhaling it was very " exhiliatory," 
and that M. Jules Verne had once told an 
interesting " story of the wild doings in a vil- 
lage which became accidentally permeated " 
with ozone. This illustration is trivial enough, 
no doubt, but it is so extremely typical of the 
sort of " newspaper science " we are concerned 
with that it will serve as well as another. The 
wonder of it is, of course, that any person so 
absolutely ignorant of elementary chemistry 
should write, and that any newspaper should 
print, so astonishing a farrago of misinforma- 
tion. 

One more illustration must suffice us. An 
improved method for the liquefaction of air has 
recently attracted much attention, and the 
newspapers have naturally taken it up. The 
same newspaper which was responsible for the 
remarkable statements about ozone to which 
reference was just made quotes the inventor as 
" stating that with three gallons of the liquid 
he had repeatedly made ten gallons, and that 
he could go on doing so for any length of time." 
" There is no reason to doubt this assertion " 
is the astonishing editorial comment upon this 
astonishing statement. Now if this means that 
the energy liberated from the aerification of a 
certain quantity of the liquefied air is sufficient, 
without any auxiliary energy, to reduce a still 
larger quantity to the liquid form, it is the flat- 
test of impossibilities, for it denies the prin- 
ciple of the conservation of energy, which is 
the fundamental principle upon which all phys- 
ical science rests. A schoolboy less omniscient 
than Macaulay's should know such a statement 
to be impossible, and he should know it with a 
firmness of conviction that should make him 
willing to stake his life upon it. If a school- 
boy can get through a common high school ed- 
ucation without knowing this and other uni- 
versal principles of the same order there must 
have been something radically wrong about his 
instruction. And it is because we are inclined 
to think that there often is something radically 
wrong about the teaching of elementary science, 
that such teaching is too apt to make information 
rather than intellectual discipline its chief aim, 
that we have wished to provide this moral with 
the sharpest possible of points.

COMMUNICA TION. 

POE AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Is it not strange how Foe's name is usually the signal 
for a free fight ? One might go up and down the streets 
proclaiming that Longfellow or Bryant or Whitman 
or anybody was the greatest American poet, and all 
would be somnolent and calm. But to speak of Foe 
in that connection is to evoke cudgels. In my case 
it is all Donny brook to a single shillelah. One critic, 
indeed, whom I am proud to call my friend, Mr. 
Pennypacker of the Philadelphia " Inquirer," has stood 
forth to champion the champion of an oppressed poet. 
Mr. Pennypacker is in some sense the father of the 
new Poe cult, so it is only right he should fight for his 
offspring. 

Although I assumed in my article printed in THE 
DIAL some time since that there was a widespread pre- 
judice against Poe, I am surprised at the extent of it. 
One correspondent, dating, of all places, from Baltimore, 
is particularly incensed. He claims it to be a well-known 
fact that whenever Poe wished to make a parade of 
learning he was in the habit of getting Professor Anthon 
to coach him. I did not refer to the vexed question of 
Poe's scholarship in my article, deeming it superfluous 
to do so. In all probability Poe had the same sort of 
learning as had Shakespeare, Goethe, and Emerson. 
It was rich and various and vital, rather than exact 
and dull and dead. He knew at least the alphabets 
of the whole circle of sciences and arts, knew their 
relations to each other and their bearings on human 
life. And when he wanted any special information he 
knew what slave of the lamp, Anthon or another, to 
summon up to get it for him. The notion that he had 
Professor Anthon on tap during the whole of his lit- 
erary life is really a humorous one. We must imag- 
ine him sending an order for an assorted bill of erudi- 
tion, and getting in return, as per invoice, samples and 
supplies of such goods to deck his show-window. In 
nine cases out of ten such a procedure would be more 
trouble to any man who had wits of his own than to 
study up the subjects for himself. The same corre- 
spondent also states that be has talked with several 
New York literary men about Poe, and they all gave 
him a bad character. Very likely. New York literary 
men are capable of anything. My correspondent has 
the advantage over me in knowing them, and I cannot 
contradict him. I have gone up to New York more than 
once, but I always camped on a hillside and preached 
the destruction of the city from afar. 

However, my proper purpose in recurring to the Poe 
question is to answer, as far as I may, the temperate 
and courteous communications which have appeared in 
THE DIAL. With Professor Tolman I have very little 
quarrel. I have no doubt he is sealed of the tribe of 
Poe himself. His analysis of Poe's " additions " is 
amusing. I always suspected there was something queer 
about that treasure chest, but I never worked it out. 
Such errors, however, are even more trivial than Shake- 
speare's anachronisms, and do not touch what I meant 
when I spoke of his inerrancy. I referred to what 
I might term the mathematics of character, that 
sense of logic in him which compelled him to think 
straight and act straight in a world which is fond of 
curves and compliances. I have no desire to make Poe 
out an angel or an uusinning man. He was doubtless 



nothing of the sort. But his faults were such as com- 
port with truth. His great sin indeed was the same 
as Dante's, and he has doubtless long been treading 
with bended back that ledge of Purgatory where Pride 
is punished. 

Professor Tolman says that Poe can never be pop- 
ular. Mr. Harvey, on the other hand, claims that 
he is popular, or at least widely prized. This is the 
crux of the case. He was immensely popular in his 
lifetime his work startled the public and vivified 
magazines and yet he was unpaid. He is popular 
in death "The Raven," I suppose, is, after Gray's 
" Elegy," the best-known short poem in the language 
and yet he is proscribed. It is the horrible injustice 
of this fate which moved me to protest. 

Mr. Harvey, in spite of real fairness, is dominated by 
the traditional conception of Poe as a sort of a Giant 
Pape sitting in the door of a cave strewn with hu- 
man bones and grinning horribly. It does not appear 
to me that Poe is often baleful or ghastly; his art is 
usually controlled by too strong a sense of beauty to be 
really unpleasant. But he is prevailingly tragic. If 
Mr. Harvey will look squarely at the masterpieces of 
tragic poetry he will find that they are all of the char- 
nel and the pit. What breath of plain air is there in the 
" JEdipus Tyrannos," or " Macbeth," or the greater part 
of " Faust "? Is there not in all of them the intense 
and contorted atmosphere of a thunderstorm? And 
with lesser tragedians, such as Ford or Webster or Emily 
Bronte, the sheer horror is still more accentuated. The 
difference between these writers and Poe is that they get 
their tragic effects from human beings, while he deals 
mainly with abstractions. From a Greek point of view, 
and even more from that of the art of the East, this 
conventionalizing and generalizing may be defended as 
tending to unity, proportion, and effect. 

And this brings me to Mr. Barrows's charge against 
Poe of a want of realism, naturalness, or, to put it in 
its strongest word, truth. Truth, like heaven, has many 
mansions. Every age inhabits a different one or to 
be more accurate, mankind vibrates between its town 
house of conventionality and its home amid the forests 
and the floods. In the day of the " Spectator," Shake- 
speare was thought a barbarian or a wildly irregular 
genius. In the time of the domestic novel, Poe naturally 
went to the wall. The volcanoes are extinct or are piped 
to furnish heat to our hot-houses. The witch Imagina- 
tion has been thrust out of doors and the hag Fact 
installed in her place. Our ideal felicity is a balance at 
our bankers, a country villa, and everything handsome 
about us. But the slicked-up human being is a savage 
still. Fire and flood and famine and disease and war 
still exist. The perturbations of nature and the pas- 
sions of man are still untamed. And because Poe, in 
an odd enough way I grant, expresses these primal 
things, he is nearer eternal truth than the painters and 
reporters of the surface of society. 

It may be answered me that there are other primal 
things sunlight and peace and happiness. Of course. 
But Tragedy does not much deal with them. People 
may say that they do not like Tragedy that they will 
not read Tragedy. The incredible childishness of the 
American mind does say something of the sort. And 
it identifies the artist with his art; it executes the bearer 
of bad tidings; it hisses the villain of the melodrama 
from the stage. The consent of the rest of the world, 
however, calls him the greatest poet who faces the 
darkest storm of life, who searches the deepest chasms 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



237 



and climbs the most inaccessible peaks of human nature. 
Poe's art is tragic therefore it deals with evil it 
could not do otherwise. But that he compromises with 
evil or is wanting in moral motives is a singular error. 
The reverse is the case to a degree that hurts his art. 
His spirituality and high-mindedness are everywhere 
apparent. Conscience comes too easily upon the scene; 
the Furies lurk around every corner; Nemesis follows 
upon the slightest transgression. It is only neces- 
sary to compare him with Stevenson to bring this out. 
Stevenson deals with evil almost in the spirit of 
mischief. The worse his characters are the better he 
likes them. He as much exceeds the sane tolerance of 
Shakespeare, which accepts evil because it is necessary 
and then does justice to it, as Foe falls short of such an 
outlook. 

" Place aux dames " is an honored custom, and I hope 
my woman critic will forgive me for leaving her com- 
munication to the last. I do it because it is perhaps 
the most important one I have to deal with. To give 
up Poe as a heartless genius is too much it leaves his 
intellect living in too dry a place. My own view of 
the matter is that his nature vibrated between the two 
poles of thought and feeling; that it was his super- 
sensitiveness, his extra emotionality, which brought him 
half his hurts, and which caused him to case himself 
as in a shell against the world. To those who accept 
Lowell's flippant characterization of Poe as one whose 
heart had been squeezed out by his brain, it must seem 
strange that nearly all his best poems were dictated by 
personal affection were tributes to those he loved. 
It is true they are not like the usual run of poems of 
the affection the keepsake kind. Poe was a conscious 
artist even when most moved, when most inspired. 
" Ulalume " was rejected originally by a woman editor, 
and it is a strange dirge for a dead wife. One of the 
main uses of books of travel, however, is to teach us 
that all men do not think or feel alike. In this matter 
of high sentiment, as Matthew Arnold would scoffingly 
phrase it, the Anglo-Saxon temperament is not to have 
the last word. I do not see that Poe's embodiment of 
his wife in Ulalume is more out of the way than Pe- 
trarch's personifications and canonizations of Lady Laura, 
or than Dante's using Beatrice to typify the Divine 
Wisdom and putting in her mouth immeasurable ser- 
mons of scholastic philosophy. Petrarch and Dante have 
not been accounted heartless men, though both of them 
were probably more faithless to their loves than Poe. 
It will be admitted, I think, that it is difficult as well 
as ungracious to argue with a woman. Their methods 
of thought are different from those of men; and, be- 
sides, like Britomart in Spenser, they always tilt with 
enchanted lances. My critic reproaches Poe for not voic- 
ing the common feelings of mankind and then when he 
does this very thing, coining his heart blood into tokens 
of beauty which must be current forever she turns 
upon him and taunts him with the musical outpourings 
of self pity. What will satisfy her? A poet must 
speak his feelings and he must not. Resolve me this 
riddle. As for girding up his loins in the strenuous 
Anglo-Norman fashion I should like to know what 
else Poe was doing all his life. I know of no poet who 
played his part in a manlier way. He faced the world 
with fierce independence. He cringed to no one and 
asked no help. He labored honestly to support his 
family. He paid his own " freight," which we have 
the authority of Eugene Field for asserting that Horace 
did not do. He did not go gallivanting after strange 



women. And when his wife died he mourned her in an 
immortal poem. In the name of all the Gods and fishes 
what can the most exacting feminine ask more? 

I have only one thing else to notice, and that is what 
somebody calls the " bad physics and worse metaphys- 
ics " of the " Eureka." I am not to speak of physics, 
yet I can see there are some considerable errors in the 
piece. A notable one is a grossly absurd theory as to 
the variations in vegetation in high latitudes in past 
times. The received hypothesis is that they were caused 
by the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. Poe was per- 
fectly cognizant of Kepler's laws and the 'mistake is a 
mere oversight. There are other flaws, but I do not be- 
lieve enough of them to make his physics at all foolish. 
His main position, the finite nature of the physical uni- 
verse, is, I understand, coming to be the accepted astro- 
nomical view. As to his metaphysics, he shares the fate 
of all other philosophers in that they are not provable. 
But this thought is interesting and in the main original. 
One of the most remarkable things in " Eureka " is the 
suggestion of a new method of proof or of a sense for 
reaching such a proof, which he names the intuitional fac- 
ulty. To a certain extent this faculty is the same as Kant's 
moral judgment that issues "categorical imperatives," 
and it is still more closely akin to Cardinal Newman's 
Illative Sense. That the physicists and English School 
of philosophers deny the existence of any such judgment 
or faculty or sense does not rob Poe of the credit of a 
bold speculation. 

And now I am done. It is not the least my desire to 
claim for Poe a place with the great world poets. 
I think, though, that he is the most vital and universal 
force in letters America has yet produced. As com- 
pared with Tennyson, when one takes him with all his 
best and makes the necessary omissions and excep- 
tions from Tennyson, they are, I think, about equal in 
range and equal in execution. And the underivable 
and daemonic spark burns brighter in Poe than in the 
English poet. On the whole, I would rank him beside 
the great originating poets of the beginning of the 
century, beside Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, Keats, 
Leopardi, and Heine. If this estimate is true he has not 
had his just deserts. That it is true is my thesis, which, 
as I think I have sufficiently defended it, I deliver to 
the judgment of others.

THE SCOUTS OF SPRING. 



Whom does she summon from her cohorts fleet, 
This Mother Nature, for her scouts to set, 
While the brown woods with melting snows are wet, 
Along the line of Winter's slow retreat, 
Lest backward turn his chill reluctant feet? 
Like star-eyed babes, half held in slumber yet, 
Smiling at vanished dreams with vague regret, 
The brave Houstonias lift their faces sweet; 

Camped on the sodden leaves, Arbutus breathes 
Her challenge to each bold rough-rider blast; 

Hepatica, in robes of softest blue, 
Guards the grim hollows with her scentless wreaths. 
Defenceless, frail, the pure array troops past: 
So Nature writes her parable anew.

THE BROWNING LOVE - LETTERS.* 



Probably the majority of right-minded and 
duly reticent persons learned with surprise, not 
to say a distinct shock, that the son of Robert 
and Elizabeth Barrett Browning was to present 
to the world, in cold type, the private corre- 
spondence of his parents preceding their mar- 
riage. Could any circumstances justify such 
a proceeding? Could it be anything but a 
desecration to remove the veil which fittingly 
is permitted to screen the most interior and 
sacred moments of life from the gaze of the 
public? Have the living a right to publish 
what the dead have refrained from publishing, 
especially when it has been written for the eyes 
of one person only ? 

However one may have answered these ques,- 
tions before opening the volumes, whoever now 
reads the whole of these 1135 pages of love- 
letters for love-letters they are, even from the 
very first will hesitate no longer in gratitude 
that literature and life have been enriched by 
classics of a new order. The qualification here 
made to read the whole needs emphasis ; 
because if one were to pick up the volumes with 
a deficient knowledge of the very peculiar lim- 
itations and situations surrounding the writers, 
and read only a page here and there at random, 
it is quite possible he will lay them down with 
derision or even disgust. But this is also true 
of Dante's Vita JVuova, or Shakespeare's Son- 
nets, or any of the other love-classics of litera- 
ture. They all presuppose a sympathetic mood, 
and some degree of knowledge of the situation, 
on the part of the reader. 

Two special reasons may be urged in the 
present instance for setting aside the usual con- 
siderations of reservation from the printed 
page : first, because Robert Browning and 
Elizabeth Barrett Browning have come to stand 
as the type of manned lovers in all time, as truly 
as Dante and Beatrice have come to stand for the 
type of the romantic and idealizing sentiment of 
man for woman, in all time ; second, because 
there is here no " raking of a man's desk " when 
he has ceased to be able to guard it, since Mr. 
Browning left the collection with his son, say- 
ing, " Do with them as you please, when 1 am 
dead and gone."

RETT BARRETT, 1845-1846. In two volumes. New York :

Moreover, the world is not in danger of be- 
ing reminded too often that there is a genius 
for loving, and that it may be just as admir- 
able, and is perhaps even more rare, than a 
genius for poetry or music or painting or sci- 
ence. When superlative gifts both for lov- 
ing and for poesy are combined, as in these 
two persons, rare and precious indeed to the 
world are the fruits thereof ! Of such, came 
the " Sonnets from the Portuguese." These 
indeed would be denied us, and even more 
strenuously, by the same canons that would 
deny us the " Letters." For not only were 
these not written for general circulation, they 
were not written even for the eye of the one 
lover who inspired them, but merely as the ex- 
pression of an over-full heart. In fact, these 
now famous sonnets were never shown to Mr. 
Browning himself until months after his mar- 
riage. At Pisa, one day, as he stood looking 
out of the window, a packet was thrust into 
his pocket from behind, by his wife, who begged 
him to destroy it if he did not approve, and 
then immediately fled from the room while he 
should read it. But Browning dared not reserve 
to himself what he recognized at once as " the 
finest sonnets since Shakespeare." So, under 
the purposely misleading title " Sonnets from 
the Portuguese," Mrs. Browning was persuaded 
to include them in the next edition of her works, 
published three years later. Time is the great 
reconciler, and after some years these " Let- 
ters " will come to their own among the classics 
of love-prose, as the " Sonnets " have won long 
since their unquestioned place in love-poetry. 
Indeed, Mrs. Browning's turns of expression 
here not infrequently recall the sonnet senti- 
ments and phrases, though there is no direct 
allusion to their composition, unless this may 
be counted as one : 

" You shall see some day at Pisa what I will not 
show you now. Does not Solomon say that ' there is a 
time to read what is written '? If he does n't he ought." 

But, aside from the consideration that since 
" all mankind love a lover " they must perforce 
love such lovers as these, the " Letters " will go 
far to correct many hitherto generally accepted 
errors of biography. For example, on the au- 
thority of Mr. Gosse we have believed that 
" During the months of their brief courtship, 
closing, as all the world knows, in their clan- 
destine flight and romantic wedding of Septem- 
ber 12, 1846, neither poet showed any verses 
to the other." No statement could be farther 
from the truth. In the first place, eighteen 
mouths of courtship scarcely can be called

" brief," either as to time or as to opportunities 
of acquaintance. It included ninety personal 
interviews and between three and four hun- 
dred of these very long and intimately confi- 
dential letters, in which each disclosed to the 
other not only the feelings of the moment but 
incidents of their preceding lives, descriptions 
of family traits, daily habits, personal friends, 
etc. Passing over the words " clandestine " 
and " romantic " though they convey a false 
impression, since it was necessity alone that 
compelled a secrecy most distasteful and for- 
eign to both natures nothing could be more 
misleading than that they did not share their 
writings with each other. Their letters reveal 
a continual consultation about the work that 
each was doing. Especially this was true of 
Mr. Browning's compositions during these 
months of 1845 and 1846. The Flight of the 
Duchess" was sent to Miss Barrett almost stanza 
by stanza as written ; " Saul " in its first form 
received her comments, and it was she who 
suggested that the printer's marks should indi- 
cate that it was published as a fragment ; 
" Luria " and " A Soul's Tragedy " were read 
by her in their proof-sheets, and here are pages 
of her advice about them. Collaboration even 
was once proposed by him, to which she re- 
sponded : 

" If you would like to write something together ' 
with me, / should like it still better. I should like it 
for some ineffable reasons. And I should not like it a 
.bit the less for the grand supply of jests it would ad- 
minister to the critical Board of Trade, about visible 
darkness, multiplied by two, mounting into palpable 
obscure. We should not mind . . . should we ? You 
would not mind, if you had got over certain other con- 
siderations deconsiderating to your coadjutor. Yes 
but I dare not do it ... I mean, think of it ... just 
now, if ever." 

It is plain all through that each found a true 
inspiration in the other. Before their meeting, 
he had written : 

" You do what I always wanted, hoped to do, and 
only seem now likely to do for the first time. You 
speak out, you, I only make men and women speak 
give you truth broken into prismatic hues, and fear the 
pure white light, even if it is in me, but I am going to 
try; so it will be no small comfort to have your com- 
pany just now, seeing that when you have your men and 
women aforesaid, you are busied with them, whereas it 
seems bleak, melancholy work this talking to the wind." 

After a meeting had been secured through the 
kindness of their common friend Mr. Kenyon, 
and the rule of a weekly visit had been estab- 
lished, Browning writes : 

" You do not understand what a new feeling it is for 
me to have someone who is to like my verses or I shall 
not ever like them after! So far differently was I cir- 



cumstanced of old, that I used rather to go about for 
a subject of offence to people; writing ugly things in 
order to warn the ungenial and timorous off my grounds 
at once. I shall never do so again at least ! As it is, 
I will bring all I dare, in as great quantities as I can 
if not next time, after then certainly. I must make 
an end, print this Autumn my last four ' Bells,' Lyrics, 
Romances, The Tragedy,' and then go on with a whole 
heart to my own Poem indeed, I have just resolved 
not to begin any new song, even, till this grand clear- 
ance is made." 

Let those who declaim against Browning's 
obscurity thank Miss Barrett that the case is 
no worse. That " Sordelloisms," as she called 
them, appear at times, even in his letters, ought 
to go far to remove the frequent charge of 
" wilful obscurity," since it is not to be con- 
ceived that in his love-letters would any man 
" wilfully " be anything less than clear. In 
this sprightly fashion she writes to him of one 
of his best-known and most melodious lyrics 
now called "Home-Thoughts from Abroad." 

" Your spring-song is full of beauty, as you know very 
well and ' that 's the wise thrush ' so characteristic of 
you (and of the thrush too) that I was sorely tempted 
to ask you to write it twice over . . . and not send the 
first copy to Mary Hunter, notwithstanding my promise 
to her. And now, when you come to print these frag- 
ments, would it not be well to stoop to the vulgarism of 
prefixing some word of introduction, as other people do, 
you know ... a title ... a name? You perplex your 
readers often by casting yourself on their intelligence 
in these things. . . . Now these fragments . . . you 
mean to print them with a line between . . . and not 
one word at the top of it now do n't you? And then 
people will read 

' Oh, to be in England,' 

and say to themselves, ' Why, who is this? . . . Who 's 
out of England? ' Which is an extreme case, of course; 
but you will see what I mean. . . . And often I have 
observed how some of the very most beautiful of your 
lyrics have suffered just from your disdain of the usual 
tactics of writers in this one respect." 

These glimpses into the workshop, so to speak, 
are of especial value because biography hitherto 
has not been satisfactory in the case of either 
poet. The standard " Life " of Robert Brown- 
ing by Mrs. Orr though accurate and full 
as to external details, is singularly barren of 
any insight into the poetic side of the man, and 
one fails to trace in it that connection which 
we know must exist between the life and the 
life-product of any man. And Mrs. Browning's 
biographers have been so much at sea that they 
have differed even as to the date of her birth. 

Charming discussions of such subjects as 
lovers in all ages are wont to write of such 
as the books they read, the persons they meet, 
the thoughts of each day, and the dreams both 
by day and night are here to be found in 
rich profusion, as may be seen by consulting

Browning's " Prospice," " One Word More," 
the invocation to " Lyric Love," and that stanza

THE STORY OF A FAMOUS IMPOSTURE.* 

In the latter part of the year 1558 there was 
published in Venice a small octavo volume of 
but fifty-eight folios, consisting of two parts, 
wholly distinct in character, and put together 
in one book only because the leading actors in 
both were members of the same family. The 
first part, which is about four-fifths of the whole, 
relates to travels in Persia by Caterino Zeno, 
Venetian Ambassador to that country in 1471- 
73 ; it is of undeniable authenticity in its main 
features, but of no great value. The second 
part, having the sub-title, " Concerning the 
Discovery of the Islands Frislanda, Eslanda, 
Engroueland, Estotilanda, and Icaria, made 
by the two brothers Zeni, Messire Nieolb, the 
Knight, and Messire Antonio, with a map of 
the said Islands," has made a great noise 
in the world, and yet, if we may accept the 
verdict of Mr. Fred. W. Lucas, "is pure fic- 
tion and wholly valueless. This part consists 

* THE ANNALS OF THE VOYAGES OF THE BROTHERS NfcoL& 
AND ANTONio ZENO in the North Atlantic about the End 
of the Fourteenth Century, and the Claim Founded thereon

Indictment. By Fred. W. Lucas, author of " Appendiculae 
Historic*," etc. Illustrated by facsimiles. London : Henry 
Stevens Son & Stiles. 



mainly of letters purporting to have been written 
by the two Brothers Zeni, and giving accounts 
of the important discoveries they had made in 
the far northern seas. These discoveries relate 
to certain countries and islands, several of which 
are mentioned in the sub-title, the names of 
which even general readers of history will re- 
member to have seen on old maps strewn about 
in the North Atlantic Ocean. The story really 
involves the question of the discovery of Amer- 
ica a full century before Columbus crossed the 
Sea of Darkness. The book, says Mr. Lucas, 
" Went forth to the world with the prestige of the 
well-known names of Zeno, Barbaro, and Marcolini 
attached to it ; and it appears to have been at once ac- 
cepted, without question, as genuine history and geog- 
raphy ; indeed, there seems to have been no reason why, 
at that time, it should not have been so accepted. The 
cartography of the Northern Atlantic was still confused. 
Many non-existent islands appeared upon the best maps 
of the time. It was still a question whether Greenland 
was united to the Continent of Europe, or to America, 
or to both, or whether it was part of Asia, or an island. 
The latter question was, indeed, still open until Peary's 
recent explorations settled the fact that it was an island." 

The influence of the Zeno book, which had 
Nicolb Zeno the younger for its author, who 
said he found the materials in the family home 
in Venice, was far-reaching and lasting. Mr. 
Lucas devotes thirteen of his folio pages to 
illustrations of its influence upon subsequent 
publications, especially maps, but stops short 
long before reaching the end of the list that he 
might have given, having said enough to show 
that for nearly a hundred years after their pub-' 
lication the book and map were generally looked 
upon as authentic. Still, doubts as to their 
genuineness soon began to appear, and have 
continued to grow until the authority of the 
whole story, while by no means destroyed, has 
become greatly impaired. Mr. Lucas no doubt 
hopes to deal it a death-blow. 

It was in no way strange that the Zeno doc- 
uments, both book and map, should have been 
accepted as genuine in the sixteenth century ; 
but, considering the gross improbability of some 
of the incidents, the discrepancies that exist 
between the book and the map, and the impos- 
sibility of adjusting the story to the facts of 
history and geography, it would certainly seem 
strange that it has retained any authority at 
all. In fact, the most ingenious and far-fetched 
devices have been resorted to to remove the 
difficulties that the book presents. Two exam- 
ples may be given. The elder Zeno, writing to 
his brother Antonio, says he found on the island 
of Frislanda a great Lord named Zechmni, 
master of some islands called Porlanda, " who 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



241 



was certainly as worthy of immortal remem- 
brance as any other who has ever lived in this 
world, on account of his great valor and many 
good qualities." Of course the Zeno adherents 
must identify this puissant chief, which they 
do, or at least some of them, by finding him in 
Henry Sinclair of Roslyn, Earl of the Orkneys 
and Caithness by the investiture of King Hacon 
of Norway in 1379. To say nothing of histor- 
ical questions, the derivation of Zechmni from 
Henry Sinclair is a philological feat upon which 
a layman, at least, had better not comment. 
Again, one 'feature of the marvellous tale of a 
fisherman who cuts an important figure in the 
letters, is that a king in Estotoland, an island 
situated in the far Western ocean, dwelt in a 
populous city with walls, and had Latin books 
in his library, which neither he nor anyone 
about him could read, a tale that moves Mr. 
John Fiske, who never lets slip a good story if 
he can help it, to ask : " Pruning this sentence 
of its magniloquence, might it perhaps mean 
that there was a large palisaded village, and 
that the chief had some books in Roman char- 
acters, a relic of some castaway which he kept 
as a fetich." 

We cannot deal with Mr. Lucas's specific 
answers to the arguments that have been ad- 
vanced in defense of the book, but rather make 
room for his own final conclusions, which are 
as follows : 

" 1. That, though Nfcol6 and Antonfo Zeno may have 
sailed into the North Sea, and may even have visited 
the Continental Frislanda, Frisia, or Friesland, and 
may have written letters to Venice during their travels, 
Nfcol6 Zeno, the younger, certainly did not compile his 
narrative from any such letters, but from the published 
works of Bordone, Olaus Magnus, and other authors 
indicated above. 

" 2. That the two accounts of Greenland attributed 
to Nfcolo and Antonfo Zeno are untrue as applied to 
that country, and could not have been honestly written 
by any persons who had visited it. 

"3. That there is no evidence that Antonfo Zeno 
ever visited any part of America, or any of its islands, 
as claimed by Marco Barbaro, Terra-Rosso, Zurla, 
Beauvois, and others; nor, indeed, do the Annals them- 
selves state that he did so. 

" 4. That there is no evidence to show that either 
Christopher Columbus or Juan de la Cosa ever heard 
of ' Frislanda.' 

" 5. That, in fact, no such island as Zeno's Frislanda 
ever existed, his map of it having been compounded 
from earlier maps of Iceland and the Faroes. 

" 6 That Zichmni, if such a man ever existed, was 
certainly not identical with Henry Sinclair, Earl of 
Orkney. 

" 7. That the story that the Carta de Navegar ' was 
copied from an old map found in the archives of the 



Zeno family is a pure fiction; and that it was, in fact, 
concocted from several maps of various dates and nation- 
alities, and not from any one map. 

" 8. That a sufficient motive for the compilation of 
Zeno's story and map is to be found in a desire to con- 
nect, even indirectly, the voyages of his ancestors with 
a discovery of America earlier than that by Columbus, 
in order to gratify the compiler's family pride and his 
own personal vanity, and to pander to that Venetian 
jealousy of other maritime nations (especially of the 
Genoese) which was so strong in the early days of the 
decadence of the great Venetian Republic, and which, 
later on, appeared so forcibly in the works of Terra- 
Rossa, Zurla, and other Venetian writers. 

" 9. That however harmless may have been the orig- 
inal motive of Nfcol6 Zeno, the younger, for the com- 
pilation of the narrative and map, it ceased to be 
innocent when he reedited his map for publication in 
Ruscelli's edition of Ptolemy (1561), whose work was, 
in Zeno's time, accepted as the greatest authority on 
geography. 

" 10. That Zeno's work has been one of the most 
ingenious, most successful, and most enduring literary 
impostures which has ever gulled a confiding public." 

No doubt some readers will think that a 
publication which justifies such a characteriza- 
tion as this hardly merits such elaborate treat- 
ment as Mr. Lucas and his publisher have 
bestowed upon it ; but the author replies to all 
such critics, that while the importance of the 
book from a practical point of view has long 
ceased to exist, it still possesses an historical 
and a literary interest, because upon the story 
contained in it is founded a claim on behalf of 
the Venetians to a pre-Columbian discovery of 
America, and also because the acceptance of 
the Zeno map as genuine by Mercator and 
Ortelius, the two leading cartographers of the 
latter half of the sixteenth century, was the 
cause of great confusion in the maps drawn 
during the latter part of that century and for 
nearly two hundred years afterwards. 

We must not dismiss Mr. Lucas's work with- 
out characterizing it as an excellent piece of 
historical investigation, and a most sumptuous 
volume typographically considered. The Zeno 
story is reproduced both in the original and in 
translation ; while there are eighteeen beautiful 
large facsimiles of important maps in plates in 
the appendix, besides numerous smaller fac- 
similes of other maps at the backs of half-titles 
and the ends of chapters. The all-important 
bibliography has also received due attention. 
Students of the subject will welcome the vol- 
ume for its original matter and its beautiful 
form, regardless of their views of the author's 
conclusions.

DATJDET AND HIS FAMILY.* 

The volume on Alphonse Daudet and his 
family inaugurates the uniform series of Dau- 
det's works in English projected by pub- 
lishers who have already deserved well of 
French fiction by their edition of Dumas. We 
could have wished for the present series a more 
auspicious beginning ; for this book is unsatis- 
factory in spite of its dainty binding and ex- 
cellent printing. Its faults are various. In 
the first place, the material is not homogeneous, 
save in the mediocrity of all its parts. In the 
second place, it is not well translated. The 
French shines through the English quite too 
often, and the English itself is not seldom ques- 
tionable in vocabulary and in style. We should 
not say, " My father writes using a little plank 
screwed to the wall " (p. 5) ; we should say, 
" shelf " or " board." We should not speak of 
"great books, dripping with emotion and sweet- 
ness " (p. 28) ; nor should we say " he broke 
me into my Latin" (p. 42). " Would" for 
" should " is also common, and such infelicities 
as " I made it a reproach to him to have never 
put," etc. (p. 51), are constant. We have 
marked many other passages, but it is hardly 
worth while to cite them. If it were important 
that the reader should know what Messrs. Leon 
and Ernest Daudet say, there would be some 
reason for desiring a revised version. As it is 
not a matter of the least consequence to the 
understanding or enjoyment of Daudet whether 
they are presented correctly or presented at all, 
we may as well turn from the translations to the 
originals of the book before us. 

These are three. Last in place and first in 
value, such as it is, is M. Ernest Daudet's sketch 
of the youth and ancestry of the brothers. This 
was made in 1881, and has no novelty to-day. 
It serves usefully to check the fancy of his 
brother's " Little What's his Name," and adds 
some interesting, though so far as we discern, 
not particularly significant, details as to the 
family ancestry. It is soberly written, in a gen- 
erous and fraternal spirit. It could be read at 
any time with a certain mild pleasure. But it 
will be hailed with the devout fervor with which 
the thirsty pilgrim greets the oasis in the desert 
by those who approach it through the interme- 
diate section of the volume, an " Appendix " 
of eighty-one pages in which M. Leon casts 
into the form of " a dialogue between my father

from the French by Charles de Kay. With portrait. Boston :

and me " some half-digested " thoughts " on the 
imagination. The purpose, result, or organic 
unity of this composition we have been unable 
to discover. We surmise, however, that its 
purpose was to pad an over-thin book, of which 
most readers will have had more than enough 
before they get to it, so that its result will be 
nil. As to its organic unity, it has at least as 
much as the first part, the Memoir proper, 
which is about as unsatisfactory to analyze as a 
jelly-fish. You discern a sort of rudimentary 
organism at the start, acephalous and inverte- 
brate though it be ; but when you have dissected 
this out it shrivels away, and what is left is a 
glutinous mass of platitudinous literary jelly. 

The book, this part of it, is throughout 
maudlin at intervals, " writ," as Lord Byron 
would say, " in a manner that is my aversion," 
peppered with "O destiny! " "O Shakespeare!" 
and similar literary hysterics. So far as we 
can see, it does not contain a single new liter- 
ary fact of moment, a single new critical point 
of view. It threshes the old grain over again, 
adding a good deal of paternal admonition to 
young Leon, that would be more edifying if he 
had not taken pains to make the scandals of 
his own domestic life as familiar to leading 
French newspapers as the dignity of his father's 
home has been to the readers of Mr. Sherard's 
excellent biographical study. 

Occasionally the carelessness of composition 
betrays M. Leon Daudet, and he deviates into 
unintentional humor. Here, for instance, are 
a few lines describing young Alphonse at a fire : 
" He appeared on the scene of the combat pour- 
ing water on himself and having water poured 
on him, holding a lance in his hand " (p. 25). 
An edifying spectacle he must have made of 
himself. The French pompier is always a 
goodly spectacle, but Alphonse, pouring water 
on himself with one hand and holding a lance 
in the other, standing at his post, Casabianca- 
like, " till the flames came and burned off his 
eyelashes and licked his hands," is heroic in his 
way, a worthy candidate for a Montyon prize. 
After this, one does not wonder to find the au- 
thor aver that " unless I am mistaken the grand 
(say gr-r-r-and) philosophical system that we 
shall have to-morrow will put emotion in the 
first rank and will subordinate all else to it." 
Evidently common sense will have to take a 
back seat if ever the "astre noir" is in the 
ascendant. Meantime, to train himself for that 
consummation we are told that Alphonse " did 
not boggle to compare " the Stanley of Dark- 
est Africa " with the victor of Austerlitz " 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

(p. 45), nor George Meredith with Hamlet 
(p. 46) " in that cottage where lights and 
shades played about his aureole " (p. 47). 

It seems a pity not to extend this fascinating 
anthology from the family memoir of the great 
romancer. I have cited only from the first 
quarter of M. Leon Daudet's work, and the 
fourth of its treasures has not been told. I must 
draw this appreciation to a close ; but here is a 
nugget of political wisdom that one would not 
willingly spare. Apropos of Dreyfus : " On 
the morning of the catastrophe I promised him 
( Alphonse Daudet) that Rochef ort [of all men ] 
would come in person to confirm him in his 
certainty. The idea of the visit delighted him, 
because he much admired the great pamph- 
leteer and recognized in him a unique gift of 
observation analagous to the divining power of 
Drumont " (p. 53). To all who know the men, 
this anti-climax is record-breaking, colossal. 

As to M. Leon Daudet's memoirs as a whole, 
I looked forward with singular eagerness to its 
appearance in the Revue de Paris, and felt a 
perplexed disappointment from fortnight to 
fortnight as I first read its parts. Then came 
the book, to increase vexation by concentrating 
puerility. I must plead, therefore, for indul- 
gence if on this third reading of " needy noth- 
ing trimmed in jollity " I close with the author's 
own words (p. 44) : " Every book is an organ- 
ism. If its organs are not in place it must die 
and its corpse become a nuisance." I do not 
think this book will be long in reaching the 
corpse stage. On the whole, however, I think 
the most epigrammatic summing up of my idea 
on this " Memoir " would be in Shakespeare's 
words : " Bottom, thou art translated."

MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES.* 



Senor Romero, the late distinguished minis- 
ter from Mexico to the United States, was ex- 
ceptionally qualified to write authoritatively 
upon the relations between the two countries. 
He twice held a cabinet position in his own 
country, so that he was familiar with its con- 
dition and policies. He was twice accredited to 
this country first during President Lincoln's 
administration and again after but a short 
interval spent at home. He was practically 
a continuous resident in our country from 
the Civil War to the time of his death a few 
months since. It is no exaggeration to say that

no representative of a foreign country at Wash- 
ington ever made a better impression or gained 
a higher position personal or official. 

The first 280 pages of this bulky volume now 
before us for review, " Mexico and the United 
States," are taken up with " Geographical and 
Statistical Notes on Mexico." This part of the 
work has already appeared as an independent 
volume and has been noticed in THE DIAL. The 
remaining pages, almost five hundred in num- 
ber, are important historic or economic studies. 

In two papers " Genesis of Mexican Inde- 
pendence " and " Philosophy of Mexican Rev- 
olutions " Mr. Romero shows that revolutions 
in Mexico are not mere exhibitions of turbu- 
lence, but natural, perhaps necessary events in 
a normal evolution from peculiar conditions. 

A study follows of " Anglo-Saxon and Ro- 
man Systems of Jurisprudence." It is a com- 
mon impression in the United States that the 
legal systems of the two countries are extremely 
unlike and that justice is a thing unknown in 
Mexico. Mr. Romero clearly distinguishes 
common law and equity English Law and 
Roman Law. Both exist in our country. So, 
too, both exist, though unequally developed, in 
Mexico. The paper is an interesting statement 
of the exact conditions prevalent in the two 
countries. It may be remarked in passing that 
Mexican Law is not administered to the dis- 
advantage of Americans in the Republic ; fre- 
quently its terms are modified in favor of our 
citizens as a matter of national comity. 

One of the most interesting chapters in the 
book, as dealing with a question which has 
threatened international complications and 
which is not even now settled, is " The Mexi- 
ican Free Zone." This "free zone," estab- 
lished by the Mexican government at the solic- 
itation of the northern states especially Tam- 
aulipas has much distressed some of our 
wordy politicians. It has been asserted that 
it has given opportunity for enormous smug- 
gling operations and has defrauded our govern- 
ment of vast sums. Mr. Romero, either as 
Secretary of the Treasury in Mexico or as 
Minister from Mexico, has never been an advo- 
cate of " the Free Zone." He however shows, 
conclusively, by statistics . and argument, that 
no serious disadvantage can have come to the 
United States from its existence, that the con- 
trary really has happened, and that no great 
advantage has accrued to Mexico. 

In " Silver and Wages in Mexico " and 
" Silver Standard in Mexico " are discussions 
of sociologic-economic questions of timely inter- 



244

est. It is a mistake to draw conclusions for 
either country from the other. Conditions in 
the two are fundamentally different. That 
Mexico is flourishing to-day with a silver stand- 
ard does not prove that the United States would 
do so. Distribution of wealth, character of 
resources, nature of the laboring population, all 
are elements in the problem. 

The final chapter on " The Pan-American 
Conference of 1889 " is interesting as present- 
ing a straightforward statement of (a) the 
originating of the idea, (6) the purposes, (c) 
the make-up and work of this interesting gath- 
ering. What we thought of the meeting has 
some value : how it impressed the other partici- 
pating nations is of greater value especially 
at this moment when we stand in an entirely 
new position with reference to other countries. 
It is certain that the conference did not do all 
that was expected of it, that it did not impress 
our neighbors strongly with our disinterested- 
ness, but it did do something in bringing 
together representatives of neighboring coun- 
tries which have many common interests and 
must perforce have many inter-relations. 

These chapters have already appeared as con- 
tributions to periodical literature, and particu- 
larly to " The North American Review." It is, 
however, a good idea to publish them in a con- 
nected and permanent form. Mr. Romero, 
either by appendices or by changes and inter- 
polations in the text, brings the matter quite up 
to date. " Mexico and the United States " will 
be an important work of reference for politi- 
cians, for students of social and economic ques- 
tions, and for the increasingly large class of 
persons who for one reason or another are 
interested in our nearest southern neighbor.

RECENT FICTION.* 



" The Open Question " was published in England 
some months ago, and attracted much attention by 
its bold presentation of an ethical problem with 
which few writers venture to grapple. The name 
of the author, "C. E. Raimond," had previously 
been attached to a number of novels, none of which 
had proved particularly noteworthy, although they 
were remembered by their readers with a certain

satisfaction. Presently it transpired that their 
authorship was pseudonymous, and that the person- 
ality of Miss Elizabeth Robins, already widely 
known as an actress in the later plays of Dr. Ibsen, 
was concealed beneath the non-committal name that 
figured upon the title-page. No pretense of keeping 
the secret is any longer made, and the American 
publishers of " The Open Question " frankly an- 
nounce it as the work of Miss Robins. Upon read- 
ing the book, we are not surprised at the interest 
which it has excited, for it has qualities that set it 
far apart from the common run of fiction. Yet the 
impression gained from reading many English com- 
ments upon the novel was very different from the 
impression which the novel itself produces. It pre- 
sents a problem, no doubt, and one of the most 
startling ; but in such a case the manner is every- 
thing, and this particular problem, which becomes 
merely brutal in a bare statement, may be treated 
with the utmost delicacy, as the performance of 
Miss Robins attests. Briefly put, it is the problem 
presented by two lovers, who are closely related by 
blood, and who both inherit a constitution predis- 
posed to the attack of consumption. Have two such 
people any right to the happiness that they most 
desire? We can imagine the reply to this question 
of our greatest ethical teachers, the fierce negative 
of Carlyle, the more suave but equally emphatic 
negative of Renan and Mr. Raskin. And, absolutely 
speaking, we should be bound to answer with them. 
But the case as it here lies before us is too compli- 
cated to be decided offhand. It is weakened by the 
notion that the fears of the lovers may be imaginary, 
for they are represented as under the obsession of 
the theoretical idea rather than as attacked by the 
disease, while modern science, as we know, emphat- 
ically denies that consumption is hereditary, the 
most that it admits being hereditary susceptibility. 
Again, the question of consanguineous marriage 
is an open one, as far as the exact limits of dan- 
ger or safety are concerned. In consequence of all 
this, we cannot help feeling that the author of 
this book has failed to make out a case clear enough 
to justify even if otherwise justifiable her con- 
clusion. She seems herself to take too hard and 
fast a view of the matter, to be over-influenced by 
what are, after all, no more than theoretical con- 
siderations. Her actual solution is to bring her 
lovers into a compact whereby they purchase a year 
of happiness with the pledge that they will end their 
own lives rather than entail disease upon any life 
yet unborn. Here is an "open question" indeed, 
one upon which we will not presume to pass judg- 
ment. It is all very effectively and even poetically 
managed, and the idea loses most of its harshness in

the working-out. And the story, on its way up to 
this tragic ending, is full, not only of interest and 
acute observation, but has no small measure of 
those finer qualities which betoken genius. There 
are occasional longueurs in the way of semi-didactic 
discussion, but at least three-quarters of the book is 
fairly glowing with life, and the chief characters 
are creations in a very fine sense of that term. 

" Poor Human Nature," by Miss Elizabeth God- 
frey, is called " a musical novel " upon the title-page, 
but hardly deserves the description. It is mostly 
concerned with musical people, to be sure, for its 
leading characters are the principals in the royal 
opera of Blankenstadt, and a great deal of the talk 
is about operatic matters. But the author evinces 
no power to make verbal interpretation of music, 
and has only the externals of the singer's life to set 
before us. When we contrast this treatment of the 
art with that found in " Evelyn Innes," for example, 
the difference is seen to be so great as to be one of 
kind. Miss Godfrey's novel is little more than a 
sentimental love story, a story of the general type to 
which " The First Violin " belongs. It would have 
been essentially the same story had its characters 
been poets or painters instead of singers. In other 
words, the artistic terms in which it is stated are of 
the interchangeable sort. This does not prevent it 
from being a fairly acceptable novel of the kind in 
which sentiment almost achieves the convincing ac- 
cent of passion. The workmanship is nicely fin- 
ished, and the outcome is not too gloomy. 

" An attempt to depict the emprise of a man who 
is a victim of the Napoleonic idea" is what Mr. 
Pemberton tells us he has made in writing "The 
Phantom Army." His hero is a Spaniard of extra- 
ordinary charm and strength of character at least 
he is intended to be all this who gathers about 
him a band of devoted adherents, and who seeks 
with their aid to overthrow the Spanish government, 
and even to overrun the rest of Europe. The au- 
dacity of his strategy leads him to several successful 
engagements, but he is overcome in the end, and 
suffers the death that such brigands deserve. Mr. 
Pemberton has evidently got much of his material 
from a study of Carlist conspiracies and methods, 
with which he seems closely familiar. His work is 
brilliant episodically rather than successful as a 
whole, and one feels that the romance was planned 
upon a scale too large for the author's powers. 

Despite a fault or two of construction, and a few 
loose ends in its complicated plot, " God's Prisoner," 
by Mr. John Oxenham, remains one of the most 
captivating works of fiction that it has often been our 
good fortune to read. Beginning with a hot-blooded 
murder in London, it ends among the islands of the 
South Pacific, and its leading character has, in the 
interval, gone through a series of the most romantic 
and startling experiences. The author's invention 
is unflaggingly brilliant, and his narrative manner 
both direct and forcible. We will not summarize 
the plot : that would be in this case peculiarly un- 
fair to the reader, besides being a totally inadequate 



way of conveying a notion of the remarkable qual- 
ities of the story. The reader bent upon excite- 
ment alone, and the reader who delights in the better 
qualities of romance in literary form and psy- 
chological portrayal, will alike find their account 
in a book which we counsel them not to miss. 

As far as our recollection goes, Mr. Albert Lee 
is a newcomer in the field of romantic fiction, and 
his " Key of the Holy House " is certainly a prom- 
ising piece of work. The scene is sixteenth century 
Antwerp, and the chief incidents are connected with 
the Spanish tyranny and the methods of the Inqui- 
sition. We have glimpses of the Prince of Orange, 
and the Beggars of the Sea are our companions for 
a time. An English episode near the close gives us 
brief sight of the Queen, and altogether there is 
much brightly-colored interest in the story, both 
historical and inventive. To mention a small mat- 
ter, Mr. Lee's Dutch names seem a trifle uncertain 
in their orthography. On the first page, for exam- 
ple, we have " Nordenstrasse " instead of "Noord- 
enstraat." 

Messrs. C. S. Bentley and F. Kimball Scribner 
have collaborated in the production of " The Fifth 
of November " a historical romance that makes no 
great pretensions and that is put together in a 
straightforward and conscientious way. Its subject 
is, of course, the Gunpowder Plot, having Guy 
Fawkes for a central figure, and providing brief 
views of the King, Monteagle, Catesby, and other 
historical characters. The fanatical spirit that led 
to the Plot is well reproduced in the dialogue, and 
the utter villainy of the thing is sufficiently tem- 
pered by our interest in the ringleaders and our 
sympathy with their motives to make the story a 
possible one. 

Two interesting examples of what may be called 
the biographical as distinguished from the historical 
romance have recently been published. In one of 
them Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole has told the story 
of Omar's life. In the other Mr. Walter Cranston 
Larned has subjected Rembrandt to similar treat- 
ment. Mr. Dole's " Omar the Tentmaker " displays 
much knowledge of Persian history and life in the 
eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the meagre sup- 
ply of facts that have come down to us concerning 
Omar's own life is in this case liberally eked out 
with selections from his verses, taken from several 
translations, and including many of which Fitz- 
Gerald had no knowledge or took no cognizance. 
The result of this pastiche of history and poetry is 
distinctly readable, although it fails to create the 
illusion proper to romance. At least, it creates only, 
and that for an occasional moment, such illusion as 
there is in an Arabian Night's Entertainment. We 
are a little startled to make acquaintance with an 
Omar who is a lover in the concrete sense, familiar 
as we are with the poet who sings so tenderly of 
love in the abstract ; but this proves merely an epi- 
sode in Mr. Dole's romance, and the interest speedily 
lapses into the strictly historical and philosophical. 
But we can hardly forgive him for making the poet

Homer. What Mr. Dole calls " an Oriental's exces-

used as a cloak for his own paronomastic depravity. 
Mr. Larned's " Rembrandt " embodies the essen- 
tial facts in the artist's career, his sudden rise to 
fame, the history of his most famous pictures 
The Anatomy Lesson," " The Night Watch," and 
" The Syndics " the pathetic story of his financial 
embarrassments, and, above all, the romance that 
has so linked the name of Saskia with his own that 
we can never think of the one without recalling the 
other. The whole narrative is informed with so 
generous an enthusiasm, and written with so vivid 
a sympathy, that we can easily pardon its excess of 
sentimentality and the vagueness of its character 
delineations. The book helps us, somehow, to feel 
the wonder of Rembrandt's consummate art, and 
that is doubtless what the author chiefly wished it

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



As Prosector of the Zoological So- 
Avian Anatomy, ciety of London, it has fallen to Mr. 

Frank E. Beddard to bring to a suc- 
cessful completion in his " Structure and Classifi- 
cation of Birds " ( Longmans) a treatise upon the 
subject of avian anatomy which his predecessors, 
Garrod and Forbes, had projected. The book is 
timely, for there has been no comprehensive work 
of recent date upon this subject, in the English lan- 
guage, which at all compares with the Monograph 
of Fiirbringer, or Gadow's extended treatise in 
Broun 's Thierreich, published in German. English 
investigators, of whom Mr. Beddard is one, have 
long been leaders in this field and the author has 
not lacked for material at hand. Over 250 figures, 
drawn from original memoirs, adorn the volume, 
and with very few exceptions they come from En- 
glish sources, the names of Huxley, Mivart, Garrod, 
Mitchell, Forbes, Selater, and Beddard being oft 
repeated as authorities. The book is a condensed 
and somewhat systematic presentation of the most 
important facts of comparative avian anatomy, and 
an extended discussion and application of these 
facts to the classification of the group of birds. In 
this phase of the work it is an advance upon any 
hitherto published. It is to be expected that old 
systems of classification would be disturbed some- 
what by this process. We are therefore not sur- 
prised to find that the author has severed the owls 
from their long association with the hawks and has 
shifted them to the neighborhood of the goat-suck- 
ers ; and to find him arguing for the primitive re- 
lationships of the pico-passerine group and the 
degeneracy of the Struthionidce as a type. For 
those who pursue at a distance the study of orni- 
thology with an opera-glass as a pastime or as an 
avocation, this book will not be light reading, though 



doubtless suggestive and profitable ; for those who 
with scalpel and lens seek the sterner discipline of 
a science, it will be invaluable. 



Types of socialism. In "Social Ideals in English Let- 
in English ters " ( Houghton ) Miss Vida D. 
literature. Scudder writes with the same careful 
scholarship, clear criticism, and alluring style as in 
her earlier work, " The Life of the Spirit in English 
Poetry." Beginning as far back as William Lang- 
land and Sir Thomas More who are classed as 
Utopian socialists born out of due time the aim 
of the book is to show the varied types of socialism 
from time to time expressed in English literature. 
The principal space about one-half of the volume 
is given to the great prose writers of the last 
half-century. The novelists Thackeray, Dickens, 
and George Eliot, and the essayists Carlyle, Ruskin, 
and Matthew Arnold, are dealt with as prophets of 
socialism in twelve chapters of admirable construc- 
tive criticism. The concluding chapter on " Con- 
temporary England" is so delightfully optimistic 
that even one who does not share in the author's 
enthusiam for social settlements cannot fail to enjoy 
its pleasing picture of the present and its prophecy 
for the future. " The mystic of former times, re- 
acting against conventions and longing for simplicity 
of life, fled like Thoreau into the wilderness ; the 
mystic of the present, actuated by the same impulse, 
flees not from but to the world, betakes himself, 
not to the woods, but to a crowded city district, and 
steeps his soul in the joy of the widest human sym- 
pathy he can attain. . . . Children of privilege and 
children of toil will be united in these groups ; 
thinkers and laborers, women and men of delicate 
traditions and fine culture, mingled in close spiritual 
fellowship with those whose wisdom has been gained 
not through opportunity but through deprivation. 
. . . They will realize in a measure the old dream 
of Langland, fellow pilgrims of Truth, while they 
share life and labor in joyous comradeship." 

Memoirs of the ^ ew characters stand out more nobly 
wife of an in history than Lord William Russell, 

English martyr. martyr to the cause o f English liberty 

under the second Charles. Few have been treated 
more exhaustively, as a result. Yet the " Memoirs 
of Lady Russell" (Macmillan), setting forth the 
facts in the life of his wife and widow, come to the 
reader in much the light of a revelation. She was 
his elder in years, a widow when he met her ; she 
survived him a full forty years, devoted to his 
memory until the end ; the honor which would have 
been his had he not been so mercilessly slain came 
to his descendants through her offices ; in every way 
her career is a notable one. There is a confused 
prefatory note to the volume which leaves the fact 
of preparation for the press much in doubt. It 
would seem that Lady Stepney, une grande dame of 
four generations ago, brought the contents together 
from the family documents in her possession. Fall-

nephew, they are now published with his authority. 
It seems ungracious to criticize one so far beyond 
the reach of this modern world, but Lady Stepney 
has injured her work seriously by making it, chiefly, 
a religious tractate, her illustrious kinswoman's 
long and virtuous life lending itself as readily for 
the pointing of a moral as for the adornment of a 
tale. Lady Russell was indeed a devoted maid, 
wife, and mother, and the book is to be read with 
profit in the human even more than the doctrinal 
sense. A brief, interesting, but not cogently re- 
lated memoir of Lady Herbert, widow of the brave 
Sir Edward who fought for his king so gallantly at 
Naseby, is added by way of conclusion. It serves 
to increase the dislike felt for Charles II., but is not 
of great importance. 



A "Social 
Settlement 
handbook. 



Messrs. Lentilhon & Co., of New 
York, have begun the publication of 
a convenient series of " Handbooks 
for Practical Workers in Church and Philanthropy," 
edited by Professor Samuel M. Jackson, of New 
York University. Among the first volumes of the 
series is a little book on " Social Settlements," by 
Professor C. R. Henderson, of the University of Chi- 
cago. It opens with an historical introduction sketch- 
ing the changes in life and thought which led up to 
the newer and higher forms of philanthropy, followed 
by an account of the immediate genesis of the Uni- 
versity Settlements in England. Here one finds 
the names of Dr. Thomas Arnold, Professor Thomas 
Hill Green, Mr. Ruskin, Frederick Denison Mau- 
rice, Charles Kingsley, and John Richard Green, as 
well as those of Edward Denison, Arnold Toynbee, 
and Canon Barnett ; and, in connection with the 
progress of the movement in England, those of both 
Mr. and Mrs. Barnett, Mr. Percy Alden, and Mrs. 
Humphry Ward. There are chronological lists of 
the University, College, and Social Settlements of 
England and America, and brief notices of many of 
the more important Houses. Part II. is devoted to 
the " Theory of the Settlement," as shown mainly 
by the writings of leaders in the movement ; and in 
the third and final part of the volume the author 
describes the manifold methods of Settlement work, 
exhibits a systematized " table of activities," and 
offers many practical suggestions to inexperienced 
workers. The book is a compendium of desirable 
information in small compass and convenient form. 
It bears some evidences of haste in preparation and 
in printing, but its defects are not such as will 
interfere with its usefulness to readers who wish to 
inform themselves about the Settlement movement. 



Among the books recently imported 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons is 
a little volume by Mr. H. Heathcote 
Statham, entitled " Architecture among the Poets " 
a long essay, originally published as a series of 
articles in "The Builder." It deals, as may be 
inferred from its name, with the references made 
to architecture by the greater poets or, to speak 



precisely, by the greater Greek, Latin, and English 
poets. The points made are two : first, that archi- 
tecture, which ranks among the least popular of the 
arts, has been of no such value to the poets as have 
painting and music ; second, that the love of archi- 
tecture for its own sake, and the perception of the 
racial and intellectual significance of style, belong 
to modern poetry alone. The classics are repre- 
sented by Homer and Virgil, and the " entirely fan- 
ciful " Homeric architecture is compared with the 
realistic description of Priam's palace which we find 
in the " jEneid." The English poets are then re- 
viewed chronologically, the elder being shown as 
affiliated, in regard to architectural terms and im- 
agery, with the classic writers, while " the new feel- 
ing," merely suggested in eighteenth-century poetry, 
becomes evident in the early romantic school, and 
rises to its full height in the poets of our own time. 
The author's especial enthusiasm is for Browning, 
in whose pages, as he very rightly declares, may be 
found a stronger descriptive power and a greater 
knowledge of architecture than in those of any other 
English poet. Of American poets, he mentions 
only Longfellow and Poe, quoting the former liber- 
ally, the latter only in a few lines from " The 
Haunted Palace "; Lowell, whose " Cathedral " we 
think worth notice in such an essay, is evidently 
forgotten. The literary criticism of the book is a 
minor matter; though generally correct, and, hav- 
ing the virtue of simplicity, it lacks the literary 
touch. Its illustrations are dainty and its ensemble 
pleasant.

the many-volumed library editions supplied, respect-

Macmillan Go. Then, the former house issued their 
one-volume " Cambridge " edition, which the latter 
house soon followed with their attractive " Globe " 
edition in two volumes. We have now to call atten- 
tion to the edition in twelve volumes just published by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., which for some purposes 
is more desirable than any of the others, particularly 
for all careful students of the poet. This " Cam- 
berwell " edition is in pocket volumes, four inches 
by six in size, and is provided with annotations by 
Miss Charlotte Porter and Miss Helen A. Clarke, 
the editors of " Poet- Lore." It is hardly necessary 
to say how entirely competent these editors are for 
the task, or with what sympathy they have per- 
formed it. There is a general biographical intro- 
duction to the edition, and a special introduction to 
each volume ; the notes occur at the end, and include 
digests of each poem. The text is the poet's latest 
revision of 1888-89, and includes in addition many 
fugitive pieces, among them the unfortunate Fitz- 
Gerald lines (which had better have been left un- 
printed), and the prose essay on Shelley. The lines of 
each poem are numbered for easy reference. Each

enterprises which the American people directed 
toward the Hawaiian Islands. In Boston and from 
official sources Mr. E. J. Carpenter has gathered 
the material for an opportune and very interesting 
history, " America in Hawaii " (Small, Maynard & 
Co.), of the growth of American influence in our 
new territory, from the landing of the little ship- 
load of missionaries from Boston in 1819 to the 
culmination in the annexation ceremonies of August 
12, 1898. The tale is of more than passing inter- 
est and is told with dramatic effect. The history 
is written from the American point of view and with 
professed sympathy for the annexation movement, 
though the treatment of persons and policies is as a 
rule candid and fair. The author's zeal for dramatic 
effect leads him to make England the villain of the 
play, in spite of her repudiation of the seizure of 
the Islands by Lord George Paulet in 1843, and of 
her uniformly neutral position in recent years. 
This same zeal, coupled, perhaps, with a lack of 
familiarity with details of local history, has led to 
some misleading statements of minor importance. 
The part that Boston merchants have played in the 
development of American commerce with the Islands 
is well told. The early sandalwood trade with China 
and the rise and decline of the whale fishery in the 
Pacific are described at length, but the growth 
of the sugar industry is barely mentioned, though 
Whitney's edition of Jarvis gives a very good ac- 
count of it up to 1872. This, however, is a story, 
not of Boston, but of Honolulu and San Francisco. 



Mr. Louis J. Rettger's bulky volume 
of " Studies in Advanced Physiol- 
ogy " (Terre Haute: Inland Publish- 
ing Co.) is a compilation from standard treatises of 
the principal facts of human anatomy, histology, and 
hygiene, with some attention to the experimental 
phases of the science and to the subject of physio- 
logical chemistry. The work is confessedly not 
critical and some of the illustrations are veterans in 
the service ; the figures illustrative of cell-division, 
for example, are quite out of date in this day of 
cytological research. There is no index, an inex- 
cusable omission in a work of this character. The 
book presents, however, an advance both in the 
choice of material and in the method of treatment, 
over many elementary treatises often used in our 
academies and normal schools. The effect of alco- 
hol upon the system is treated in a brief and sensible 
manner, with a noticeable absence of exaggeration 
and a commendable candor. Teachers and boards 
of education will find many practical suggestions 



for the control and suppression of contagious dis- 
eases in the public schools in the rules of the Indi- 
ana State Board of Health, which are given in full 
in the chapter upon Public Health. The history of 
the science is also well treated in the opening chapter.

taken on a new interest for us, Mr. E. H. Strobel's 
account of " The Spanish Revolution, 1868-1875 " 
(Small, Maynard & Co.) will be read with pleasure 
and profit. It is not easy to get started in the book, 
for it is a section taken out of a projected larger 
work and so fails to give the necessary information 
as to parties and conditions. But when one gets 
into the current of the narrative he finds it most 
interesting. The story is dramatic in its rapid 
changes, its making and unmaking of kings and 
republics. " In six years the Spaniards had seen a 
panorama of governments pass before them, . . . 
each a failure and each in turn replaced by another 
failure." The restoration of Alfonso of Bourbon 
closed the series of changes, but not the misfortunes 
of that unhappy country.

present volume contains all the common helps for 
easy reference, numbered paragraphs with bold- 
faced headings, maps, index, chronological table,

easy reading, for during eight centuries this little 
country in the middle of Europe has had relations, 
friendly or as prospective prejr, with the warring 
powers on all sides of her, and this complex history 
cannot be put into less than three hundred pages in 
a flowing narrative style. But the work is valuable 
as a trustworthy epitome of Swisd history, and as 
such can be heartily commended.

Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. have just issued an 
attractive little book that should find many purchasers 
"The Memory of Lincoln." It is a collection of 
eighteen lyric tributes to the martyr-President, compris- 
ing all worthy of preservation that have appeared to 
the present time, with an interesting introductory essay 
on " The Poetic Memory of Abraham Lincoln," by the 
editor of the volume, Mr. M. A. De Wolfe Howe. The 
book is furnished with a fine frontispiece portrait of 
Lincoln. The same publishers send us " Washington's

The well-known series of " Monographs on Artists," 
edited and written jointly with other authors by Pro-

only in the German text. We are glad to note that 
Messrs. Lemcke & Buechner of New York have now

British Museum. Two volumes, devoted to Raphael 
and Holbein, have been published, and are issued in 
handsome mechanical form with a profusion of well-

form a satisfactory history of all the great periods of art. 

The following are the latest publications among French

The series of " Temple Classics," published in this

LITERARY NOTES. 

"Quentin Durward," in two volumes, is the latest 
addition to the " Temple " edition of Scott's novels, pub- 
lished by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The Macmillan Co. have published a third edition of 
Mr. George Birkbeck Hill's " Gordon in Central Africa, 
1874-1879," which first appeared eighteen years ago. 

" Our Feathered Friends," by Miss Elizabeth Grinnell 
and Mr. Joseph Grinnell, is an illustrated reading book 
for young pupils just published by Messrs. D. C, Heath 
& Co. 

Dr. Charles Waldstein is now in this country occu- 
pied in lecturing before the Archaeological societies and 
other audiences upon the subjects of Greek art and the 
results of recent excavations. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson has prepared an abridged edition 
of " Don Quixote " for " school and home reading." 
Except for the considerable omissions, the text, which is 
Ormsby's translation, is left practically unchanged. 

" Art and the Beauty of the Earth " is the title of a 
lecture by William Morris, delivered in 1881, and now 
printed with the author's own " golden " type at the 
Chiswick Press. Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. are 
the publishers. 

A new and revised edition of Mr. Maurice Hewlett's 
charming volume of sketches and translations, entitled 
" Earthwork Out of Tuscany," first issued three years 
ago, has been published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons 
in connection with Messrs. Dent of London. A number 
of rather slight pencil sketches, made by Mr. James 
Kerr-Lawson, are contained in this edition. 

A happy outcome of the recent tribute publicly paid 
to Mr. Carl Schurz for his distinguished services in so 
many good causes is the endowment fund of twenty 
thousand dollars contributed by the German- Americans 
of New York. Columbia University is to be the trustee 
of this fund, one half of which provides a fellowship in 
German literature and the other half is to be used to buy 
books for the Germanic department of the University. 

Professor Benjamin Moore is the author of an " Ele- 
mentary Physiology " published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co., which we can recommend most heartily 
for its attractive presentation, compact form, and sci- 
entific accuracy. We note, further, that the index con- 
tains no reference to alcohol, tobacco, or narcotics, 
which fact will probably prove a still stronger recom- 
mendation to all teachers who wish to deal seriously 
with the subject. 

It is announced that there remain in the hands of the 
heirs of the late George Brinley, some copies of the 
parts of the Brinley Catalogue, with the exception of 
the first, also some copies of the index, and of the price- 
lists. So long as they last these will be sent gratuit- 
ously to any public library making application for them, 
specifying the parts required, and enclosing fifteen cents 
for each part (five cents for price-lists) to cover postage 
and mailing expenses applications to be addressed to 
W. I. Fletcher, Librarian of Amherst College, Amherst, 
Mass. 

Emile Erckmann died about the middle of last month. 
As the associate of Alexandre Chatrian, who died in 
1890, he contributed not a little to the instruction and 
entertainment of his fellow-countrymen, and the Erck- 
mann-Chatrian series of historical novels, if at times 
somewhat flamboyant in their patriotism, and if lacking

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



in the finer literary qualities of fiction, achieved a note- 
worthy and well-deserved success. They were whole- 
some literature, although not the best of art. The 
partnership of the two men lasted for something like 
forty years, and is one of the most remarkable instances 
of collaboration in literary history. A short time be- 
fore Chatrian's death, an unfortunate quarrel estranged 
the two novelists. Erckmann was born in 1822, and 
had lived to the age of seventy-six years. 

The new uniform edition of " Sketches and Studies 
in Italy and Greece " (imported by Scribner), by the 
late John Addington Symonds, is now made complete 
by the publication of the third volume. This volume is 
the richest of the three, for it includes the marvellous 
chapters on Siena, Perugia, and Orvieto, the subtle and 
sympathetic studies of Lucretius and Antinous, while 
from the titles of still other chapters the magic names of 
Amalfi, Psestum, Capri, Syracuse, Girgenti, and Athens, 
meet the reader's eye. These studies are literature of 
a very noble sort and will bear repeated perusal. It is 
a great pleasure to have them all collected in the present 
set of dignified volumes. 

Several novel features will distinguish the " British 
Anthologies " which Professor Edward Arber is editing 
for the Oxford Press, from other collections of English 
verse which have appeared. The series will contain 
some two thousand five hundred entire poems and songs 
(exclusive of extracts which have been inserted spar- 
ingly), printed for the most part in large type on stout 
paper in crown octavo volumes, and published at a pop- 
ular price. Some three hundred authors will be repre- 
sented, a few for the first time in any anthology. Use 
has been made of the earliest and most authoritative 
texts, but the spelling and punctuation have been re- 
vised where necessary. Each volume will consist of 
three hundred pages of text, to which are added an 
index of first lines and authorities, and a glossary. 
Pains have been taken to prevent lines being turned. 
Each volume will be identified by its title with the chief 
poet of the period treated, and together with his works 
will be printed the compositions of his contemporaries 
and anonymous poems of the same date. Not one-fifth 
of the total, however, will be anonymous. Ten volumes 
have already been arranged for The D unbar Anthol- 
ogy, 1401-1508; The Surrey and Wyatt, 1509-1547; 
The Spenser, 1548-1591 ; The Shakespeare, 1592- 
1616; The Jonson, 1617-1637 ; The Milton, 1638- 
1674; The Dryden, 1675-1700; The Pope, 1701-1744; 
The Goldsmith, 1745-1774; and The Cowper Anthol- 
ogy, 1775-1800. Of these the Shakespeare, Jonson, 
and Milton volumes will be published immediately, and 
the remainder will follow in quick succession. Profes- 
sor Arber's reputation and experience in editing reprints 
his experience extending over thirty years are a 
sufficient guarantee that these Anthologies will be schol- 
arly, and that he will avoid the pitfalls into which so 
many compilers of collections of verse have fallen. As 
an illustration of the labor spent on the volumes it may 
be interesting to state that no fewer than fifty-five texts 
have been verified at the Bodleian from sources which 
are not to be found in any public library in London, not 
excluding the British Museum. The natural grouping 
of the poems, the historical basis on which the volumes 
have been planned, the notes and glossaries, will com- 
mend these " British Anthologies " to systematic stu- 
dents of English literature at home and abroad, and it 
is hoped that the fulness, variety, and freshness of the 
selections will appeal to all classes of readers.

H"VHE Proprietors who in 1861 purchased the Spectator have since that 
date conducted it themselves. They are therefore exempted from 
many influences which press severely on the independence of jour- 
nalism, and have from the first made it their chief object to say out 
what they believe to be truth in theology, politics, and social questions, 
irrespective, not only of opposition from without, but of the opinion of 
their own supporters. Their object is to reflect the opinion of cultivated 
Liberals, but in the matter of the American War they fought against 
the mass of the very class they are trying to represent, and were finally 
acknowledged by them to have been in the right. 

The news of the current week is compressed into an animated nar- 
rative, which the laziest or busiest may read, without missing the life 
or import of the events. 

The Spectator contains a list of all Books published during the week 
(not under one shilling in price), with the names of the publishers and 
the prices attached, a feature which will greatly increase its value to 
booksellers, librarians, literary institutions, and private gentlemen.

How

With 56 Suggestive

Mr. Crockett considers this ro- 
mance of the 15th century in Scot- 
land (on which he has been working 
for the past ten years) his strongest 
work. The fall of the great House 
of Douglas, with which it deals, he 
says. " was the one romance of ray 
boyhood." 

Size, 5V4x8^. Rinding, cloth, deco- 
rated; Pages, 475; Illustrated; 81.50. 

This most interesting work could 
easily stand upon its own merits, even 
without the literary connections its 
author has with Swift and Moliere, 
or with M. Rostand's famous play. 
It is a charmingly fanciful and poetic 
piece of literature, full of imagina- 
tion and delicate conceits. 

Size, 4x6; Pages, 220 ; Binding, flei- 
iblf doth ; Illu*trat*d ; 50 cents net. ( Uni- 
form with, " Cyrano.") 

The author was on the New York 
all through the war, and his admir- 
able personal account is well supple- 
mented by the special contributions. 
The book is the authoritative record 
of the North Atlantic Squadron's 
work, and clears up many mooted 
points. 

Size, 6x9(4; Pages, 350; many Illus- 
trations, Maps, and Diagrams; Binding, 
cloth, decorated; 82.50. 

Mr. Parsons (who is a Fellow of 
the Society of American Landscape

By

An Hungarian 
Nabob. 

By MAURUS JOKAI. 

Translated by 
R. NISBET BAIN. 



These wonderful life masks of 
famous Americans, the work of 
J. H. I. Browere, whose invention 
died with him, reveal to us for the 
first time the features and facial 
character of our great statesmen as 
they really were. 

Two Editions; Size, 794 x 10; 21 full- 
page plates ; 50 copies on large paper, with 
plates on Japan, with an eitra set of plates 
on heavy C"<iird paper, suitable fur fram- 
ing, each $25.00 net ; 347 copies, regular 
numbered edition, each S6.00 net. 

This is a great novel in the truest 
sense of the word. Its chief figure 
is a herculean dentist in an "accom- 
modation street" of San Francisco 
who sloughs off his thin veneer of 
civilization altogether under the in- 
fluence of misfortune. The man 
McTeague is a most daring concep- 
tion, yet he is always convincing and 
absorbingly interesting. 

Siz', 5 l / z x8^; Rinding, cloth, deco- 
rated; Pages, 440; Type, \0-point; $1.50. 

A careful, dispassionate, and able 
summing-up of the whole campaign 
by a writer who went all through it 
himself. Mr. Bonsai has done for the 
American private soldier at Santiago 
what Kinglake did for the English 
soldier. 

Size, 6 x 9 "4 ; Pages, 543 ; Illustrations, 
\Qfuti-page insi-ls and 5 maps, 2 of them 
on. a large fuller ; Binding, cloth ; Type, 
\\-point; 82.50. 

The character of the old Nabob in 
this romantic novel and the wild life 
of the powerful Magyar nobles at the 
beginning of the century are revela- 
tions to the American reader, while 
the dramatic interest never flags. 

Size, 5V4 x7y s ; Binding, cloth, decora- 
tive design; Pages, 358 ; $1 25.

NEW BOOKS. ~" 



James Russell Lowell and his 
Friends. 

By EDWARD EVERETT HALE, D.D. With many por- 
traits and other illustrations. 8vo, $3.00. 
This is an uncommonly interesting book. Dr. Hale was in 
college with Mr. Lowell, and they were intimate friends. The 
hook shows a very hearty appreciation of Lowell as a poet and 
essayist, as a diplomatist, and as a high-minded and most de- 
lightful man. It brings before us a wonderfully attractive 
group of Lowell's friends. The book is charmingly uncon- 
ventional and cannot fail to be read with eagerness. The illus- 
trations include many portraits of Lowell, portraits of his 
friends, views of places associated with his life, and facsimiles 
of letters. 

Through Nature to God. 

By JOHN FISKE. 16mo, $1.00. 

This book discusses, in Mr. Fiske's large and luminous way, 
the mystery of evil, the cosmic roots of love and self-sacrifice, 
and the everlasting reality of religion. It falls in the same 
group with his " Idea of God " and " Destiny of Man," which 
have been an inspiration and a source of strength and light to 
a multitude of readers. 

Letters of Thomas Carlyle to his 
Youngest Sister. 

Edited, with an Introduction, by CHARLES T. COPE- 
LAND, Lecturer on English Literature in Harvard 
University. With portraits and other illustrations. 
Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

These letters to Carlyle's sister who lived in Canada date 
from 1832 to 1875. Mr. Copeland has strung them on a slender 
thread of biography, and, as the London Academy says, " has 
done his work extremely well." The letters show the tenderer 
and more attractive side of Carlyle's character. 

Thaddeus Stevens. 

By SAMUEL W. McCALL. In " American Statesmen 

Series." 16mo, $1.25. 

A biography of "The Great Commoner" who was so con- 
spicuous a figure in Congress during the war for the Union. 
Mr. McCall, the able representative from Massachusetts, has 
told the story exceedingly well. 

Throne = Makers. 

By WILLIAM ROSCOE THAYER, author of " The Dawn 

of Italian Independence," " Poems New and Old," 

etc. 1 vol. 12mo, $1.50. 

The "throne-makers" are Bismarck, Napoleon III., Kos- 
suth, and Garibaldi. To these are added papers on Carlyle, 
Tintoret, Giordano Bruno, and Bryant. 

The research and uncommon power of statement which 
make Mr. Thayer's volumes on " The Dawn of Italian Inde- 
pendence " so noteworthy a contribution to modern historical 
literature lend to the first four papers in this book unusual 
value ; and the broad intelligence and independent judgment 
of Mr. Thayer give to the last four papers a high and perma- 
nent quality. 



A Tent of Grace. 

By ADELINA C. LUST. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

An uncommon story of German village life in the middle 
of this century. The motif of the story is the gulf that sepa- 
rates races, notably the Christian and the Jew. The heroine 
is a beautiful Jewess, loved alike by Jew and Christian ; and 
the struggle in her mind between the dominant power of her 
religious traditions and the force of her affection is depicted 
with high dramatic quality. The story possesses elements of 
intense interest, and is written with uncommon vigor. 

The Ladder of Fortune. 

By FRANCES COURTENAY BAYLOR, author of " Clau- 
dia Hyde," etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
A story of wealth which the possessor does not know how 
to use ; of struggle to gain a footing in good society ; of West- 
ern America and Paris, told with the skill of a practiced 
novelist. 

The Conjure Woman. 

By CHARLES W. CHESNUTT. 16mo, $1.25. 

"Mr. Chesnutt's stories are really very true to nature and 
to their Southern environment. In some respects they are 
truer because the writer comes from the outside of the South. 
The novelty of these tales and the artistic and entertaining 
manner in which they are told are sure to win for them a wide 
popularity and give the author an enviable place among Amer- 
ican story-writers." Nashville Banner. 

The Wire = Cutters. 

By Mrs. M. E. M. DAVIS, author of "Under the 
Man-Fig," etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
" An exceedingly interesting story." Literary World 
(Boston). 

"A remarkable novel." Cincinnati Commercial Tribune. 

Tiverton Tales. 

By ALICE BROWN, author of " By Oak and Thorn," 

etc. 12ino, $1.50. 

Twelve stories of rural life, showing rare observation, 
humor, sympathy, and refinement, the same charm which 
made Miss Brown's "Meadow-grass " so popular. 

Complete Poetic and Dramatic 
Works of John Milton. 

Cambridge Edition. Edited by WILLIAM VAUGHN 
MOODY. With Introductions to the longer poems, 
and Notes, Translations of Milton's Latin poems, 
Indexes to titles and first lines, and a biographical 
sketch. With a fine portrait and an engraved title- 
page containing a vignette of Milton's home. Large 
crown 8vo, $2.00. 
This is one of the best volumes in the Cambridge Edition, 

and beyond comparison the best single-volume edition ever 

published of Milton's poetical works.

THE EDUCATIONAL OUTLOOK. 

During the session of the Illinois Legisla- 
ture now just ended, two educational measures 
of the highest importance were presented to 
that body for consideration. One of them pro- 
vided for the control of degree-conferring insti- 
tutions, to the end that the scandal of the 
fraudulent issue and sale of diplomas should 
cease ; the other sought to create a new organi- 
zation for the public schools of Chicago, to 
the end that politics and personal influence 
might be eliminated from their management, 
and statutory sanction be given to those fun- 
damental principles of educational administra- 
tion which are now accepted with practical 
unanimity by all educational leaders. The for- 
mer of these measures was popularly known 
as the " Rogers Bill," from the fact that it was 
championed by the president of the North- 
western University ; the other was similarly 
dubbed the " Harper Bill," from the fact that 
it emanated from a commission having the 
president of the University of Chicago for its 
chairman. Both measures were discussed by 
us at the time of their introduction into the 
Legislature, and are thus, in their general terms, 
familiar to our readers. Both measures made 
for progress, and were the outcome of an en- 
lightened intelligence applied to the educational 
situation in Chicago. There now remains to 
us to chronicle, not merely the defeat of these 
measures, but the significant fact that they did 
not even receive respectful consideration, that 
they were rejected with derision and contumely. 

We are free to say that we were not at any 
time of the sanguine souls who anticipated any 
other outcome than this. It was almost a fore- 
gone conclusion that a body of timorous poli- 
ticians of the sort that we choose to have for 
our law-makers would not discuss such propo- 
sitions as these upon rational grounds ; that 
they would be swayed by what seemed to them 
the prevailing sentiment of the public. We say 
" seemed," and wish to emphasize the word, 
because what seems to be public opinion in such 
cases is usually the opinion of a small minority, 
made up chiefly of interested persons who are 
fearful lest their weakness be exposed and the 
privileges they have usurped be wrested from 
them. These persons promptly rally about the 



262

legislative lobbies when attack is threatened, and 
their angry buzzing enables them to gain their 
ends without much resort to the two-edged 
weapons of logic and rational discussion. Those 
who form the real majority, meanwhile, have 
too much inertia to be moved to speedy action, 
and have only just begun to bestir themselves 
when the question is already disposed of, and 
the powers of darkness have once more pre- 
vailed. 

Since the result of this preliminary effort in 
the direction of educational reform has been 
about what was expected, we cannot fairly say 
that we are discouraged. Much public interest, 
including some of the intelligent kind, has been 
aroused by the discussion, and the movement 
now well started is sure to gather impetus as 
the months go on, and we are as assured of its 
ultimate triumph as we were of the temporary 
setback it has just experienced. Out of the dis- 
tracting conflict of theories that has enlivened 
educational discussion during the past score of 
years, there have gradually emerged certain 
controlling ideas that have risen above the plane 
of the debatable, and are sure to impress them- 
selves eventually upon our school systems. This 
slow but sure development of unity out of diver- 
sity, of order out of chaos, in the educational 
domain is an indication altogether encouraging 
to those who have the cause of education at 
heart, and when we take a comprehensive view 
it is the one fundamental indication of recent 
discussion. A quarter of a century ago, such 
journals as " The Educational Review " and 
" The School Review," such reports as those 
of the Committee of Ten and the Committee 
of Fifteen, such a piece of legislation as the 
Massachusetts high-school law of 1891, even 
such a Commission as framed the law which 
has just been defeated in Illinois, would have 
been simply impossible. The conditions that 
made all these things possible have come into 
existence in this country during very recent 
years. Looking at the general situation in this 
light, it cannot fail to appear encouraging, in 
spite of the failure of the Illinois Legislature 
to rise to the opportunity set before it, and in 
spite of the reactionary spirit displayed by a 
considerable section of the teaching force in 
the schools of Chicago. 

We may also take encouragement from the 
experience of New York City during the past 
few years. Not more than five or six years 
ago, the condition of public education in that 
community seemed well-nigh hopeless. So far 
had its methods of administration fallen behind 



the times, that its school system, instead of 
leading those of our American cities, had be- 
come an object of contempt. Yet a single term 
of the mayoralty, owing to the fortunate elec- 
tion of an officer strong enough to inaugurate 
and carry out a thoroughgoing reform, sufficed 
to put the schools of New York nearly where 
they belong, at the head of our municipal sys- 
tems. The present problem in Chicago is 
nothing like as difficult as was the New York 
problem, and there is every reason to anticipate 
for it a satisfactory solution. With a Super- 
intendent determined to exercise the preroga- 
tives that rightfully belong to his office, and 
with a Mayor (just reflected for his second 
term) who, although he may have made mis- 
takes, has nevertheless taken a more active 
and intelligent interest in the city schools than 
any of his predecessors for twenty years has 
done, the outlook is reassuring to those who 
hold as the most sacred of all causes the cause 
of public education. 

We wish to repeat upon this occasion what 
we said three months ago, that the report of the 
Educational Commission of last year, together 
with the accompanying draft of a new school 
law, was, taken as a whole, an expression of 
the most enlightened ideas upon the subject 
with which it dealt, and that its adoption, with 
a few amendments, would be the most fortunate 
thing, educationally, that could happen to 
Chicago. At least nine-tenths of it was alto- 
gether praiseworthy and desirable, and if the 
remaining one-tenth was open to question, our 
sense of its value as a whole was so high that 
we would have been willing to accept the ques- 
tionable sections for the sake of the great 
improvement promised by the rest. Doubtless 
this would not have been necessary, for a lit- 
tle rational discussion would have excised the 
merely tentative suggestions of the plan, leav- 
ing only those features upon which enlightened 
educators now agree with almost complete 
unanimity. Had the document been dealt with 
in this spirit, recognizing the disinterested zeal 
of the body that gave a year of hard work to 
its formulation, admitting the soundness of most 
of its positions and calmly weighing the few 
that seemed doubtful, we might have chronicled 
its fate without any touch of bitterness. But 
it has been painfully obvious to all who have 
followed this discussion, that interest and pas- 
sion had much more to do with the rejection of 
the plan than did anything that might fairly 
deserve the name of argument, that the teach- 
ers who attacked it used the weapons of the

politician rather than those of the educator, 
and that to borrow a phrase from a recent 
cause celebre in New York there are some 
" fine old educational mastodons " still lumber- 
ing about our social jungles. The influences 
that led to the defeat of the proposed law were 
mainly of the lower sort ; they came from the 
least competent and progressive elements of the 
teaching body ; they were appeals to prejudice 
rather than to intelligence; and they accom- 
plished their purpose by resorting to wilful 
misrepresentation. As for the Legislature that 
made itself the tool of these influences, we can- 
not do better than say of it, in the words of the 
Chicago " Evening Post," that it " rests like a 
dead weight upon every movement that is calcu- 
lated to promote the best educational interests 
of the commonwealth." 



THE FRIEND OF JASPER 
PETULENGRO. 

Perhaps you are wearied of the sometimes dizzy 
heights of romanticism and the oftentimes monot- 
onous plains of realism. Then form acquaintance 
with a man who, if he find you a kindred spirit, 
shall show you a new country which is yet an old 
one ; a traveller through whose eyes you shall see 
things which are strange, yet familiar; a writer 
whose words go to the making of the essay proper, 
which is " the world viewed thro' the prism of indi- 
viduality." Through the prism of this man's individ- 
uality you shall have a view of life, unique, full of 
strange lights and shades, of a clearness sometimes 
startling. 

The man is George Borrow litterateur and 
travelling tinker, zealous churchman and enthu- 
siast in the manly art of self-defense, literary hack 
and nature worshipper, acute philologist and " pal " 
of the Romany dials. Never was there so strange 
a combination in one personality ; never was there 
a better illustration of the saying of the Autocrat : 
" This body, in which we cross the isthmus between 
the two oceans, is not a private car but an omnibus." 
Sorrow's writings are comparatively unknown ; but 
book-lovers have a strongly developed property 
instinct, and find an added attraction in the thought 
that a favorite author is little known or caviare. 
The reader of " Lavengro " has that sense of inti- 
macy and possession that means so much to those 
born with the book-mark. 

Borrow's whole leaning was toward the unusual, 
and circumstances seemed always to incline him in 
that direction ; he was born for adventure, as other 
men to trouble : the cause lay not in his surround- 
ings, but in himself. "One finds in Rome only 
what one takes there," and Borrow took with him 
a freshness of observation and an attitude of mind 
not paralleled in literature. 



His first meeting with the Gypsies, who were to 
so strongly affect his after life, is worth noting as 
characteristic both of his style of narrative and of 
the man. He has come suddenly upon the Petul- 
engro family, which is evidently engaged in the 
making of counterfeit money. 

" I '11 strangle thee," said the beldame, dashing at 
me. " Bad money, is it? " 

" Leave him to me, wifelkin," said the man, interpos- 
ing; " you shall see how I '11 baste him down the lane." 

Myself. I tell you what, my chap, you had better put 
down that thing of yours ; my father lies concealed within 
my tepid breast, and if to me you offer any harm or 
wrong, I '11 call him forth to help me with his forked 
tongue. 

Man. What do you mean, ye Bengui's bantling? I 
never heard such discourse in all my life: playman's 
speech or Frenchman's talk which, I wonder? Your 
father ! tell the mumping villain that if he comes near 
my fire I '11 serve him out as I will you. Take that 
Tiny Jesus ! what have we got here? Oh, delicate Jesus ! 
what is the matter with the child? 

I had made a motion which the viper understood ; and 
now, partly disengaging itself from my bosom, where it 
had lain perdu, it raised its head to a level with my 
face, and stared upon my enemy with its glittering eyes. 

The man stood like one transfixed, and the ladle with 
which he had aimed a blow at me, now hung in the air 
like the hand which held it; his mouth was extended, 
and his cheeks became of a pale yellow, save alone that 
place which bore the mark which I have already de- 
scribed, and this shone now portentously, like fire. He 
stood in this manner for some time; at last the ladle fell 
from his hand, and its falling appeared to rouse him 
from his stupor. 

" I say, wifelkin," said he in a faltering tone, did 
you ever see the like of this here ? " 

But the woman had retreated to the tent, from the 
entrance of which her loathly face was now thrust, with 
an expression partly of terror and partly of curiosity. 
After gazing some time longer at the viper and myself, 
the man stooped down and took up the ladle; then, as 
if somewhat more assured, he moved to the tent, where 
he entered into conversation with the beldame in a low 
voice. 

The recontre ends in his being made " brother " 
to young Jasper Petulengro, the future Gypsy 
" Pharoah " and his mentor in the Romany world 
that world that was to know the young scholar 
as " Lavengro " and the " Romany Rye," and which 
was to serve him as an intermittent home, a refuge 
and very present help in time of trouble. From this 
meeting the Gypsy motif begins to appear in his 
life, and in a few years the Romany Chals were to 
him brothers and the Romany women sisters, though 
some of the latter (like the murderously inclined 
Mrs. Herne, with her brimstone disposition) were 
exceptions to the rule. 

No one can tell how much of Borrow's work is 
autobiography, but one feels that his writings are 
dyed through and through with his experience and 
his individuality. The style is unusual and faulty ; 
and yet the wild life, the broken narrative whose se- 
quel may appear in a place entirely unlooked for, the 
mass of information on out-of-the-way subjects, 



264 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



perhaps the touching for the evil chance, perhaps 
horse-charming, perhaps the forgotten meaning of 
a word, all contribute to a whole which is strangely 
fascinating. 

His style is faulty ; true, but he can limn a per- 
sonality or a landscape with a vividness that many 
a master of style would rejoice to possess. For a 
man with angles in his character, Borrow has an 
affection ; for all affectation and humbug, only 
scorn. The thoughts and motives of his men and 
women are never analyzed, but the reader feels that 
he knows the make-up of the nature before him. 
There is the talk with Jasper : 

" What is your opinion of death, Mr. Petulengro ? ' 
said I, as I sat down beside him. 

" ' My opinion of death, brother, is much the same as 
that in the old song of Pharaoh, which I have heard my 
grandam sing 

" Cana marel o manus chivios anck 5 pay, 
Ta rovel pa leste o chavo ta romi." 

When a man dies, he is cast into the earth, and his wife 
and child sorrow over him. If he has neither wife nor 
child, then his father and mother, I suppose; and if he 
is quite alone in the world, why, then he is cast into the 
earth, and there is an end of the matter.' 

" And do you think that is the end of man ? ' 

" ' There 's an end of him, brother, more 's the pity.' 

" Why do you say so ? ' 

" ' Life is sweet, brother.' 

" Do you think so ? ' 

" ' Think so! There 's night and day, brother, both 
sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother, all sweet 
things ; there 's likewise a wind on the heath. Life is 
very sweet, brother; who would wish to die ? ' 

" < I would wish to die ' 

" ' You talk like a gorgio which is the same as talk- 
ing like a fool were you a Rommany Chal you would 
talk wiser. Wish to die, indeed ! A Ilommany Chal 
would wish to live forever!' 

" In sickness, Jasper ? ' 

"'There 's the sun and stars, brother.' 

" ' In blindness, Jasper ? ' 

" ' There 's the wind on the heath, brother ; if I could 
only feel that, I would gladly live forever. Dosta, we '11 
now go to the tents and put on the gloves; and I'll try 
to make you feel what a sweet thing it is to be alive, 
brother!'" 

In that talk you have the underlying spirit, the 
motif, of the Gypsy. Does the thought never come 
to you on one of those days when you weary of the 
city street, that the spirit there outlined, the feeling 
of joy in mere living, is an inheritance which we 
have practically thrown away, refined out of our 
lives? There comes to most men some experience 
perhaps it is standing on the border-line of the 
great forest that breaks the sweep of a northern 
prairie and breathing the sweet cold wind of spring 
that sweeps the plain and roars in the bending trees 
overhead, perhaps it is facing the salt breath of the 
ocean which gives them a taste of the divine elixir. 
The thought is thenceforth with them that we are 
far from that part of happiness that should come 
from mere physical existence, that primal feeling 
still strong in the Romany blood. 



How few words are required to indicate the man 
who knows how to use his mother tongue, and how 
often do we find this noble simplicity in Borrow, a 
manner of writing that carries with it more than 
the mere signification of the words. When applied 
to character-drawing this quality becomes extremely 
effective, as in his talks with Isopel Berners. Hers 
is a magnificent character, and though she is alone 
among all the women of fiction, one feels that here 
is a true reading of one of those almost indecipher- 
able manuscripts, women. 

Borrow, like Keats and Stevenson, believed in 
the body ; he revelled in outdoor life, in violent 
sports, and especially in " the manly art." How 
delightful is the narration of how the shabby old 
gentleman, by means of his Broughton guard and 
chop taught him by the immortal Sergeant himself, 
served out the bruising coachman, the bully of the 
line. But better yet is Sorrow's own contest with the 
Flaming Tinman, the best man in the north country. 
Mr. Stoddard refers to this as the finest thing of the 
kind in literature ; and one must certainly go far ta 
match it. In the fight of the frail youth against the 
burly ruffian shines clear and bright the indomitable 
spirit which characterized him, that spirit which in 
later years made possible the "Bible in Spain." 

This slight sketch cannot consider that side of 
Borrow shown in his philological work and in his 
travels, both illuminated by his strangely fascinating 
personality ; but it should not close without a rec- 
ognition of the fact that his character is essentially, 
and in the best sense, religious. Therein lies the 
secret of his strange success in gaining the good- will 
of natures differing apparently so widely from his 
own, be they those of the Romany Chals, the Fancy, 
or the Welch preaching brotherhood. This feeling 
is shown in his tribute to the wandering preachers, 
as he comes across one, standing on the seashore, 
preaching salvation to the fishers gathered around 
him, amid the roar and boom of the breakers. The 
ending of this episode is particularly Borrowesque : 

" I would have waited till he had concluded, in order 
that I might speak to him and endeavor to bring back 
the ancient scene to his mind; but suddenly a man 
came hurrying to the monticle mounted on a speedy 
horse, and holding by the bridle one yet more speedy, 
and he whispered to me, 'Why loiterest thou here? 
knowest thou not all that is to be done before midnight? ' 
and he flung me the bridle; and I mounted the horse 
of great speed and I followed the other who had already 
galloped off. And as I departed I waved my hand to 
him on the monticle, and I shouted ' Farewell, brother T 
the seed came up at last after a long period ! ' Then I 
gave the speedy horse his way, and leaning over the 
shoulder of the galloping horse I said, Would that my 
life had been like his, even like that man's ! ' ' 

With this saying, that shows the true George Bor- 
row, let us say Good-day to " Lavengro," but let it 
be an Ave as well as Vale, and be it in the words 
of the Hungarian master of horse at the Horncastle 
Fair : " Here 's to the Romany Rye ! Here 's to the 
Sweet Master"! ^ LFBED S UM NER BRADFORD.

THE DIAL 



265 



A SKEIN or MANY YARXS.* 

Mr. Frank T. Bullen's fascinating and 
instructive account of his cruise of some twenty- 
two years ago round the world on the bluff old 
New Bedford whaler " Cachalot " makes its 
appearance fortified by the glowing endorse- 
ment of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. In an open 
letter to the author, Mr. Kipling assures him 
that his book is " immense," that he has " never 
read anything that equals it in its deep-sea 
wonder and mystery," that " it 's a new world " 
he has " opened the door to," and so forth. 
All this praise from Sir Hubert Stanley must 
make Mr. Bullen feel as good as if he were 
homeward bound with a fair wind, a " full " 
ship, and a Captain's " lay " to reckon his share 
of the voyage on ; and we congratulate him on 
his feelings. But (it may be well to point out) 
Mr. Kipling's practical experience of sperm- 
whaling being limited, his testimony to the 
" immensity " of Mr. Bullen's book must be 
taken cum grano, and as going to its literary 
merits mainly. Mr. Kipling can hardly claim 
to be an expert witness in the case from the 
technical, or New Bedford, standpoint ; else, 
we make bold to say, he must have felt bound 
to pick a small-sized hole or two even in the 
coat of Mr. Frank T. Bullen. 

Not that we by any means presume to charge 
Mr. Bullen with sailing under false colors when 
he styles himself " First Mate " (plain " Mate " 
would, by-the-bye, have been the corrector 
form for a whaleman), or with having gained 
his whaling experience through the easy and 
not untried process of " pumping " some an- 
cient New Bedford or Provincetown mariner 
caught on the wharves and " held up " for the 
purpose. The keel of more than one popular 
" sea-story " we could mention that has been 
eulogized as " immense " by critics who (as 
Mr. Bullen might say) could not tell a binnacle 
from a bung-knocker or a " scrap " from a 
"horse-piece," has been laid pretty much in 
that way. But Mr. Bullen's book is unmistak- 
ably from a hand that knows an " iron-pole " 
as well as a pen-handle. He will understand 
us when we say that there is very little " white- 
horse " about it. Its author clearly is (or has 
been) a sailor, and, more than that, a whaler. 

* THE CRUISE OF THE CACHALOT : Round the World after 
Sperm Whales. By Frank T. Bullen, First Mate. Illustrated. 
New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



We gladly admit that his narrative, at its best, 
is as salt as Lot's wife and as breezy as Nan- 
tucket ; that he describes the process of " rais- 
ing," striking, killing, cutting in, and trying 
out a whale far better than we have seen it 
described elsewhere ; that his bordereau of a 
whaleship's proper gear, tackle, apparel, and 
furniture is full and accurate, from try-works 
to chock-pins. But, nevertheless, we can 't 
help wondering how it is that Mr. Bullen, with 
all this store of professional knowledge at his 
fingers' ends, should here and there make slips 
in his terminology that would grate on the ear 
of a green hand four months out of New Bed- 
ford. Maybe the slips are intentional, and due 
to the author's pardonable desire to make him- 
self clear to the lay reader ; but slips they are, 
and in the very shibboleth of his calling. For 
example, what practical whaleman, clothed and 
in his right mind, was ever known to style the 
flukes of a whale the "tail," as Mr. Bullen 
does with rasping frequency? And did Mr. 
Bullen, while aboard the " Cachalot," ever hear 
a boat-steerer called a " harpooner," or a lone 
whale a " solitary " ? 

On the other hand, Mr. Bullen's book is the 
first one of its kind we have met with that is 
free from certain stereotyped errors of writers 
on his subject the annoyingly persistent one, 
in particular, that represents the man at the 
mast-head as singing out " There she blows ! " 
at sight of a spout. Possibly a very green hand 
(remembering the formula given in the books) 
might do so once. But Mr. Bullen sets us 
right on this point. He reproduces with pho- 
nographic truth that magic cry from the crow's- 
nest that is to a whaleship what the blast of 
Gabriel's trump will be to a graveyard. 

" I turned in at four o'clock A. M. from the middle 
watch and, as usual, slept like a babe. Suddenly I 
started wide awake, a long mournful sound sending a 
thrill to my very heart. As I listened breathlessly, 
other sounds of the same character but in different tones 
joined in, human voices monotonously intoning in long 
drawn-out expirations the single word ' bl-o-o-o-o-w ! ' 
. . . ' There she white waters ! Ah, bl-o-o-o-w, blow, 
blow ! ' " 

There are also one or two little inaccuracies 
or inconsistencies not exactly of a technical sort 
in Mr. Bullen's book that we must point out. 
He starts out by describing the " Cachalot " as 
a full-rigged ship, which she appears to be 
in the pictures; but later on he calls her a 
"barque" square-rigged on the fore and main 
masts, and fore-and-aft rigged on the mizzen, 
like most of the New Bedford fleet. This is a 
small matter, perhaps, but we expect accuracy

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



from a sailor on these points. But the oddest 
of Mr. Bullen's lapses is the extraordinary 
" sea-change " suffered by the speech of Mr. 
Count, Mate of the " Cachalot," in the course 
of the narrative. Early in the voyage Mr. 
Count is made to say : 

" I 've seen a fif ty-bar'l bull make the purtiest fight 
I ever hearn tell ov a fight that lasted twenty hours, 
stove three boats, 'n' killed two men. Then, again, I 've 
seen a hundred 'n' fifty bar'l whale lay'n' take his grooel 
'thout hardly wunkin' 'n eyelid never moved ten 
fathom from fust iron till fin eout. So yew may say, 
boy, that they 're like peepul got their iadividooal 
pekewlyarities, an' thar 's no countin' on 'em for sartain 
nary time." 

One would scarcely expect this same Mr. Count 
(become Captain on the death of the " Cacha- 
lot's " original " Old Man ") to get off the fol- 
lowing neat little speech to the crew a few 
months later on : 

" Men, Captain Slocum is dead, and, as a consequence, 
I command the ship. Behave yourselves like men, not 
presuming upon kindness or imagining that I am a weak, 
vacillating old man with whom you can do as you like, 
and you will find in me a skipper who will do his duty 
by you as far as lies in his power, nor expect more from 
you than you ought to render." 

Nothing like promotion and a " good voy- 
age" to polish up one's English, it seems. 
There 's another little count (no pun intended) 
in our not very serious indictment of Mr. Bul- 
len. He has not perhaps overdrawn the bru- 
tality that reigned for the most part on board 
the particular vessel he chanced to ship on. 
But he tends (unintentionally no doubt) to 
give the impression that such brutality is the 
rule on all these vessels, and that the New 
Bedford whaler generally is, or was, like the 
" Cachalot," more or less a " floating hell." 
Now, Mr. Bullen must know that such is not 
the case. The conditions of the service the 
perils of the calling, the length of the voyages, 
the great disparity in numbers between officers 
and crew, the often reckless and unruly char- 
acter of the latter, etc. make it necessary that 
order be maintained with a firm hand, and that, 
from first to last, forecastle be kept in awe of 
cabin. In bad cases something like a reign of 
terror is the sole alternative to insubordination 
and disaster ; and, it must be owned, there are 
cases where the reign of terror is due more to 
the savagery of the officers than the character 
of the men. But there are " home ships " as 
well as "hell ships" sailing out of New Bedford, 
with men and not brutes in command of them. 
We recall one good old barque of Mr. Bullen's 
time (and there were others of her class) whose 
Mate was a hero every inch of him, and a gen- 



tleman to boot ; whose crew was a happy fam- 
ily of " shipmates all "; and whose good old 
Skipper (now at rest) was a type of old-fash- 
ioned Down East piety. There was a tradition, 

indeed, that Captain C , momentarily 

" downed " by the Old Adam, had once been 
heard to swear ; but the occasion was a trying 
one. The ship was lying " hove to " in a gale, 
when a great sperm whale rose alongside, blow- 
ing and wallowing in the brine not twenty fath- 
oms to leeward, and gazed calmly at his enemies. 
Lowering the boats in such a sea was out of the 
question ; and there was much strong language. 
" There goes a hundred an' twenty bar'ls plum 
to , by the great Jehosaphat ! " said Cap- 
tain C , as he went below to hide his 

feelings. That night (so the story ran) the 
men who stole aft to peep at the clock back 
of the binnacle saw through the cabin skylight 
the penitent " Old Man " poring over his 
" big ha' Bible " till well in the Middle Watch ; 
and who can doubt that his peace-offering was 
accepted ? 

Mr. Bullen is not a good hand at dialect. 
Happily, there is not much of it in his book, 
and there is but one variety. Yankees, " Por- 
tagees," " niggers," all the " Cachalot's " poly- 
glot crew, are made to speak pretty much the 
same preternatural lingo a sort of cross be- 
tween the Whitechapel " patter " of Mr. Alfred 
Chevalier and the speech of the plantation 
"darky." Fancy a Vermont Yankee fresh 
from the ploughtails talking in this way, for 
instance : "I doan see de do' way any mo' at 
all, sir." Did Mr. Kipling ever hear anything 
like that up Brattleboro' way, we wonder? 

But Mr. Bullen is a capital hand at descrip- 
tion, and he writes from a memory packed with 
scenes and processes that nine out of ten of his 
readers will have never seen described before. 
Of his style, the following pathetic episode may 
serve as a sample. A cow whale has been 
" struck " with the harpoon, and the author 
goes on to describe the denouement: 

" But, for all the notice taken by the whale, she 
might never have been touched. Close nestled to her 
side was a youngling of not more, certainly, than five 
days old, which sent up its baby-spout every now and 
then about two feet in the air. One long, wing-like fin 
embraced its small body, holding it close to the massive 
breast of the tender mother, whose only care seemed to 
be to protect her young, utterly regardless of her own 
pain and danger. If sentiment were ever permitted to 
interfere with such operations as ours, it might well have 
done so now; for while the calf continually sought to 
escape from the enfolding fin, making all sorts of puny 
struggles in the attempt, the mother scarcely moved 
from her position, although streaming with blood from 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

a score of wounds. Once, indeed, as a deep searching 
thrust entered her very vitals, she raised her massy 
flukes high in air with an apparently involuntary move- 
ment of agony; but even in that dire throe she remem- 
bered the possible danger to her young one, and laid the 
tremendous weapon as softly down upon the water as if 
it were a feather fan. ... So in the most perfect quiet, 
with scarcely a writhe, nor any sign of flurry, she died, 
holding the calf to her side until her last vital spark had 
fled, and left it to a swift despatch with a single lance- 
thrust." 

Naturally, there are marvels not a few in 
Mr. Bullen's book which landsmen will find 
hard to accept as fact. They will " shy " at 
some of his stories (mere commonplaces of 
whaling) pretty much as the Gold Coast chief 
did at the missionary's assertion that in his 
own country he had seen water get so hard in 
winter that men walked on it and sawed it up in 
blocks. " Gospel man heap liar ! " roared the 
indignant Bongo who had already accepted 
some of the good man's toughest Old Testament 
stories without a quiver ; and we have no doubt 
some of Mr. Bullen's unsalted readers will feel 
at times like using language similar to that of 
the Gold Coast skeptic. But while Mr. Bul- 
len's experiences and adventures certainly lose 
nothing in the telling, we cheerfully vouch for 
the substantial, and in proper cases the literal, 
truth of his narrative. It forms, we believe, 
the first published account from the seaman's 
standpoint of a sperm-whaling voyage in a New 
Bedford ship ; and the " Cachalot's " voyage, 
it should be added, took her into the South 
Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Oceans, and 
the Japan and Okhotsk Seas, round the Cape 
of Good Hope and the Horn, and to many re- 
mote ports and islands little known even in 
these globe-trotting days. 

In fine, Mr. Bullen's book is brimful of 
truths that are far stranger than most men's 
fiction, and it is as instructive as it is readable. 
The marvels of the deep sea are mirrored in 
his pages, and the novel phase of human life 
and character he paints is painted substantially 
to the life. It was an odd chance that threw 
a man of Mr. Bullen's unquestionable literary 
talent into so rude and unpromising a calling ; 
but it was a happy one. In its declining days, 
whaling has found in him its picturesque his- 
torian. E . G . j.

THE AMERICAN BUTTERFLY BOOK.* 

The collecting habit is a natural one, and is 
by no means confined to the bower-bird of 
Australia or the arctic foxes of Franz-Josef 
Land. Intellectual and even esthetic diversion 
may be found in the collecting of postage- 
stamps or of old blue china ; but objects of 
natural history are par excellence, the spoil of 
the amateur collector. Here is found not only 
the widest range of choice but also the greatest 
freedom of access ; it is here that the zeal for 
classification enjoys its fullest gratification and 
the search for the beautiful its natural satisfac- 
tion. The collection and study of butterflies is 
a favorable, and has long been a favorite, pur- 
suit for the amateur as well as for the specialist. 
The natural beauty of these common objects 
excites the interest and holds the attention. 
The methods of capture are somewhat simple, 
and the expenditure attending the instalment 
and maintenance of a collection is relatively 
slight. The student has unrivalled opportuni- 
ties for the study of many of the most interest- 
ing biological problems of the day, such as 
variation, seasonal and sexual dimorphism, and 
the effects of the various elements of the en- 
vironment, such as food and temperature, upon 
the form and color of the full-grown organism ; 
he also has the privilege of contributing to our 
knowledge of the life-histories of many forms 
which are as yet unknown; furthermore, his 
pursuit is quite free from the objectionable 
features which pertain to the robberies of the 
bird's-nesting oologist and the bloody business 
of many an amateur ornithologist. There is 
little esthetic or economic objection to any 
diminution in the numbers of butterflies and 
caterpillars that may result from his activity. 
The lack of an illustrated, inexpensive, and 
at the same time fairly complete manual of this 
group has been hitherto a serious obstacle to 
the growth of amateur interest in butterflies in 
this country. Europe and the Continent are 
more fortunate in this respect. We have, to 
be sure, several most excellent and inexpensive 
handbooks by eminent authorities, but these are 
limited in their geographical scope to parts of 
the country, include but a part of the species, 
and are in no case fully illustrated. The mono-

superb lithographed plates, are too expensive 
for any but the larger libraries, or the most 
self-denying specialist ; but even these fail to 
figure many of the American species. 

This need of an illustrated manual bids fair 
to be supplied by Chancellor Holland's " But- 
terfly Book." It has been the aim of the author 
to provide a popular handbook of the diurnal 
Lepidoptera of this continent north of Mexico. 
The opening chapters deal in a pleasing man- 
ner with the anatomy and development of the 
butterfly, collecting apparatus, and the breed- 
ing of specimens, the arrangement and preserva- 
tion of collections, the classification of the group, 
and the literature of the subject. The remain- 
der of the book is taken up with a systematic 
and descriptive catalogue of species, all of which 
are figured. Brief descriptions are given, not 
only of the butterfly, but also of the egg, cater- 
pillar, and chrysalis, wherever these are known. 
In many instances both sexes are figured, and 
in some cases both the upper and the under 
sides of the wings are shown, while supple- 
mentary figures which elucidate anatomical 
structures of diagnostic importance are to be 
found in the text. Details of color and of 
structure which may be derived from a study of 
the illustrations are to a large extent eliminated 
from the descriptions. In all, about 550 forms 
are described and figured ; while Mr. Skinner's 
recently published " Synonymic Catalogue of 
North American Rhopalocera " ascribes 645 to 
the territory covered by this work. The manual 
is thus not an exhaustive one. It should be 
noted, however, that over five-sixths of the spe- 
cies are described and figured ; that practically 
the whole of the butterfly fauna east of the 
Mississippi River is included ; that the omitted 
forms are either small and insignificant (as, 
e. g., many of the Hesperidce), and are thus of 
little popular interest, or they are of doubtful 
specific rank and cannot be readily distin- 
guished from their nearest relatives. Further- 
more, no work on American butterflies presents 
so exhaustive an iconography of our lepidop- 
teran fauna. 

In the preface to the book the author says : 
" I flatter myself that I have possessed peculiar facil- 
ities for the successful accomplishment of the undertak- 
ing I have proposed to myself, because of the possession 
of what is admitted to be undoubtedly the largest and 
most perfect collection of the butterflies of North Amer- 
ica in existence, containing the types of W. H. Edwards, 
and many of those of other authors." > 

The number of such " types " or specimens that 
served for the first published description of the 
species, which are figured in the book, is stated 



in a descriptive circular issued by the publish- 
ers to be " fully three hundred." The scientific 
value of this fact is, however, largely lost, for 
such figures are in no way designated in the 
descriptions of the plates, and are but rarely 
indicated in the text. 

Scattered through the book are a number of 
apt quotations, ranging from grave to gay, or 
even facetious at times, and anecdotal digres- 
sions which are more or less germane to the 
subject. These add variety, though perhaps 
not always dignity, to the theme. 

The most noticeable feature of the work, and 
one that is destined to attract wide attention, is 
the series of forty-eight plates, which exhibit in 
their natural colors over five hundred different 
butterflies. These are shown in all the charming 
array of brilliant coloring and delicate tints of 
the originals, with an accuracy and faithfulness 
that is as wonderful as it is surprising. The 
plates are prepared from photographs of the 
actual butterflies, by the so-called process of 
color-photography, or three-color printing. The 
results of the application of this method to the 
illustration of this scientific subject are most 
gratifying, and promise much for the future. 
These plates rival the most skilful and expen- 
sive chromo-lithography if, indeed, they do 
not surpass it in the accuracy with which the 
general color effect, as well as the specific tints 
of an intricate pattern, are reproduced. The 
optical limitations of photography are such that 
the structural details are at times obscured in 
the figures, but these can be illustrated readily 
by other methods. The American press is to 
be congratulated upon its signal success in this 
new venture, for this volume exhibits a marked 
advance over the work of the Societe de Pho- 
tographic en Couleurs a Puteaux put forth 
recently in Delage, and Herouard's " Traite de 
Zoologie Concrete." 

To suggest shortcomings in a work which has 
so many commendable features seems indeed to 
be gratuitous, especially as any suggested de- 
fects are rather only sins of omission, and the 
very low price at which the book is sold is per- 
haps both their occasion and excuse. In the 
first place, there is no synopsis of the group, 
and there are no keys, natural or artificial, for 
the determination of genera and species. Char- 
acters of diagnostic value are not emphasized 
sufficiently in the text. The collector is thus 
encouraged to ignore structural details which 
form the basis of classification, and to descend 
to the level of the philatelist, merely scanning 
the plates for the identification of his speci-

mens. More recognition of variants and of vari- 
able forms, and a fuller discussion of the syn- 
onomy and more references to literature, would 
add to the utility of the book to a considerable 
degree. The cultural value of the work would 
be greatly enhanced by a more generous recog- 
nition of the butterfly as a living thing and a 
part of the economy of nature. To stimulate 
an interest in its life-history, its activities, and 
its relations and exquisite adjustments to the 
animate and inanimate world about it, is quite 
as desirable as to rouse an ambition for a com- 
plete collection of "painted beauties" dead, 
to be sure, but impaled in orderly array and 
duly designated by the proper Latin binomial. 
Finally, stouter binding and tougher paper are 
most desirable in a handbook destined to the 
hard usage which this one is sure to receive. 

The publishers are to be congratulated upon 
the production of so excellent a model, mark- 
ing, we trust, a new epoch in methods of sci- 
entific illustration. The author has prepared 
a most excellent handbook of a fascinating sub- 
ject, and it is to be hoped that the companion 
volume, " The Moth Book," may not be long 
delayed. CHARLES A. KOFOID. 



THE 



PLAY.* 



Not a year ago I saw an article on the edi- 
torial page of an influential journal, which 
began by saying that " another literary artist " 
had " undertaken to reunite literature and the 
stage, whose divorce has been so often and so 
dogmatically declared by the melodramatists." 
This interested me : I had heard talk of the 
divorce, although I had not known that the 
melodramatists were responsible for it, and I 
was glad to hear of the reconciliation which the 
article went on to speak of as almost, if not 
possibly quite, successful. That seemed to me 
a good deal for one single work to accomplish, 
and I became curious about it. The literary 
artist in question was Mrs. Craigie, or "John 
Oliver Hobbes " (I 'm sure I do n't know which 
to call her or him ; it 's very awkward indeed 
about the pronouns), and the means of recon- 
ciliation was "The Ambassador," which ap- 
peared in print not so very long ago. 

It struck me at the time as rather curious 
that " John Oliver Hobbes " should be spoken 
of as a path-breaker, as one of the very few 
literary fellows who had to do with the theatre. 

* THE AMBASSADOR : A Comedy in Four Acts. By John 
Oliver Hobbes. New York : Frederick A. Stokes Co. 



In this country, I know, the line is pretty 
sharply drawn ; but then, we are not talking of 
this country : " The Ambassador " was pre- 
sented in London. I found, however, as I went 
on, that the article was extremely exclusive in 
its conception of Literature. This appeared 
when I read later that " Dumas and Pinero are 
almost the only men who take a high grade of 
literary art to the theatre." You see it was 
before " Cyrano de Bergerac " had become 
known among us, and before the author of 
" Catherine " had been elected to the Academy. 
Still, to confine ourselves to the dramatists of 
our own tongue, why was Mr. Henry Arthur 
Jones left out ? That was surely too bad. It 
must have been an oversight, for " Michael and 
His Lost Angel " has been in print for some 
years, so that anyone may see how literary 
Mr. Jones is. Mr. Jones, I suppose, may have 
consoled himself at being classed as unliterary 
along with Ibsen, Hauptmann, Sudermann, 
d'Annunzio, Echegaray, and many Frenchmen. 

But, after all, what is a " literary play " ? 
What is meant by " taking literary art to the 
theatre " ? I don't know anything else to say 
except that a literary play is one that can be 
printed in a book and read with satisfaction by 
a cultivated person (i. e., somebody like myself : 
that 's what a man generally means when he 
says " cultivated person "). I do n't see much 
that can be said beyond that. The fact that a 
man is or is not professionally connected with 
the theatre has nothing to do with it. Moliere 
was an actor, Lessing a dramatic critic, Sheri- 
dan a manager ; yet they contributed to litera- 
ture much more, so far as the drama is con- 
cerned, than Voltaire, Klopstock, and Addison, 
who were distinctly men of letters. 

It may seem foolish to say that a literary 
play is one that is printed in a book. Still, 
there can be no doubt that there have been 
" literary plays " which never made a part of lit* 
erature, solely because they were never printed. 
People saw them, liked them perhaps, and for- 
got them ; and there was an end of it. But if 
you print your play and get the right people to 
read it and like it, then it becomes literature, 
in the sense, of course, that a great many other 
things become literature. 

If, however, we think of literature in a more 
confined sense, what then ? Is there not some- 
thing aside from the accident of paper and 
print about a play that we can say is literary ? 
Suppose there are two plays that both please 
us ; do we not often think of one as literary 
and the other not? A man said to me not

long since that " The Liars " was literature : 
but I never heard that said of " Tess of the 
d'Urbervilles." What is there about one play 
that there is not about the other ? If you see 
the two plays you are certainly more moved by 
" Tess ": why, then, is it not more literary ? 

I do not know, I 'm sure. Print the two and 
perhaps I could tell. But just now let us re- 
turn to " The Ambassador." 

" The Ambassador " may be compared (in 
fact, one cannot well help comparing it) with 
Pinero's " The Princess and the Butterfly." 
They are plays of much the same general 
character, comedies of character and incident, 
set in the same world, mostly in the same place, 
more or less alike in plot though not in motive. 
Being so nearly alike, then, any difference 
ought to be very clear. Now, as it is well 
known that Mr. Pinero is a practical play- 
wright, and not a literary man tempted to the 
theatre, we may have here a means of seeing 
what is the difference between a playwright's 
play and a literary play. 

It will interest you to read the two plays 
within a short space of time and try to see 
whether there is any real difference between 
them. It would not seem to be in the plot : 
Mrs. Craigie's plot is the simpler, but not any 
more literary. In fact, both are somewhat 
stagey. Pinero's play is of a middle-aged man 
and a middle-aged woman who were once in 
love with each other. Twenty years after their 
youth they meet and think they will marry each 
other. Each marries somebody else who has 
been introduced into the play solely for that 
purpose. In " The Ambassador " the middle- 
aged man has several middle-aged ladies who 
like to flirt with him. He marries none of 
them, but falls in love with a young woman 
who has to be disengaged from a worthy young 
baronet, who gets engaged to somebody else. 
The difference is that Mr. Pinero's plot is a 
little more regular in a way : each pair illus- 
trates the same notion. Mrs. Craigie's second 
pair has no very great reason for existence. 
Mr. Pinero's play is also a little more involved : 
there are more complications in it a young lady 
of doubtful parentage, for instance. Neither 
action is absolutely natural or probable, though 
both are natural or probable enough for the 
stage. " The Ambassador," being the simpler, 
is somewhat the more natural. 

Nor would the difference seem to be in the 
characters. St. Orbyn and Sir George Lam- 
orant, indeed, might change for each other 
sometime just for fun, and few would notice 



the difference: two middle-aged and pretty well- 
preserved gentlemen who fall in love rather 
suddenly, and without your really believing 
either to be serious. St. Orbyn is rather a 
cheerful diplomatist, it is true, and Sir George 
is a man of the world rather down in the mouth 
at being middle-aged ; but otherwise the differ- 
ence would depend largely on the actors. Of 
course, the other characters do not by any means 
run parallel. Still, you might compare Las- 
celles and St. Roche, if you like, or the ladies 
who come and call on the princess with the 
ladies who come and call on Lady Beauvedere. 
Doubtless a person more familiar with the 
world these remarkable people move in would 
see points of difference ; but I do not see much. 
On the stage they would probably wear differ- 
ent colored frocks. 

Then there is the dialogue. Here, too, there 
is a likeness, as there must be in any good rep- 
resentation of the talk of well-bred people. 
There is a good deal of sparkle, of course, 
Mrs. Craigie's probably the more genuine. 
Take these two specimens. The first is from 
" The Princess." 

LADY RINGSTEAD: I confess I hardly care to sit down 
to dinner at half-past six. 

MRS. SABISTON: Oh, I do n't mind that, but I cannot 
undertake to rise at half-past seven. 

This is from " The Ambassador ": 

LADY BEAUVEDERE: Nearly ran away ! Why, every- 
one knows that if she had n't been thrown from her horse 
and killed that very morning on her way to meet him. 

ST. ORBYN: I never attend post-mortems on a con- 
science. 

It seems somewhat of the same piece, and rather 
a well-known web at that. 

Yet, on looking back over what I have writ- 
ten I must confess to having rather deceived 
the reader. All the things I have said were 
alike, are alike, I believe, but there are 
also differences. I am not sure that these dif- 
ferences make " The Ambassador " more liter- 
ary, but I suspect they do : at least, I am pretty 
sure that they made " The Princess and the 
Butterfly " more successful on the stage. 

Take the dialogue : there is much that is 
alike, certainly. But here are two passages 
coming at precisely the same place in the two 
plays, the place where the middle-aged man 
and the young girl have just arranged matters. 
The first is by Mr. Pinero. 

SIR GEORGE: I have loved you since oh, for these 
many days. You know it. 

FAY, almost inaudibly : Yes. 

SIR GEORGE: You you you return my love ? 

FAY, faintly : You know it. 

SIR GEORGE: For how long have you loved me ?

FAY: Since for these many 
And here it is in " The Ambassador ": 

ST. ORBYN: I want to tell you how much but if I 
could say how much it would be little I love you. 

JULIET : Why ? 

ST. ORBYN: Because you are pretty . . . and yet 
that 's not the reason either. 

JULIET: What, then. 

ST. ORBYN: Because you are honest . . . that 'snot 
the reason either. 

JULIET: What? Well, guess again ! 

ST. ORBYN: Because . . . Oh, Juliet, it is because 
you make me forget the reasons why ! 

JULIET: Then remember the reasons why not. lam 
poor. . . . 

ST. ORBYN: So are the angels. 

JULIET: And then . . . 

ST. ORBYN: Well, dearest? 

JULIET: . . You make me forget the reasons why not. 

There is a difference, certainly : there 's not 
a shadow of a doubt Mrs. Craigie is the more 
natural and (to me) more charming ; but I 
rather think that Mr. Pinero would call forth 
more applause, especially when he repeats his 
little bit with a slight change in the course of 
a minute. 

Then as to the characters. I spoke of the 
two men : they certainly are more or less alike. 
But the two women : as certainly they are 
not. Juliet and the Princess are two very dif- 
ferent people. It is rather idle to try to ex- 
plain the difference to any purpose in short 
compass and without quotation. But the fact 
of it calls our attention to another thing. Mr. 
Pinero's characters are all more or less built 
on the model furnished by the idea of his play. 
They are people on whom middle-age works 
differently. Thus, one is a woman who still 
loves her husband, and one is a woman who 
chiefly loves her dinner. Of the men, one re- 
mains young in middle-age, or would like to ; 
and another has become middle-aged in the 
midst of his youth. In other words, the charac- 
ters are more or less consistent with the scheme, 
or balanced against each other, but not espec- 
ially real. Mrs. Craigie's characters are uncon- 
strained by any such conventionalities, and are 
therefore, other things being equal, rather more 
life-like. 

And then as to plot : the two are truly very 
much alike, but Mrs. Craigie's is much the 
simpler. In " The Princess and the Butterfly," 
Sir George has a ward whom he thinks is the 
daughter of his brother. She meanders pic- 
turesquely through the play, having nothing to 
do with it until Sir George finds out that she 
is not his brother's daughter but the daughter 
of some old Italian, having been changed in the 



cradle. So he kisses her, and, though that is 
not his intention at the time, falls in love with 
her afterwards. Certainly a very romantic love- 
making : certainly that belongs to the stage, 
no one would claim it for literature. Then 
there is another complication, a great mix-up 
about a woman of shady reputation who is en- 
gaged to a deluded young Frenchman : she 
goes where she should not, and there is a quar- 
rel which leads to a duel, and the deluded man 
who provokes the duel becomes good and mar- 
ries a little girl who is only in the play to be 
ready for him. As to the " Ambassador," the 
only complication comes to nothing by the reso- 
lute refusal of all parties to suspect each other 
of what would be very unlikely. That appeals 
to me : I like it. But I rather think the com- 
plication would do better on the stage : it gives 
more " go " to the business to have Demailly 
throw water on Sir George, and to have Fay 
appear in harlequin's clothes, especially when 
that part is taken by a lady who looks well in 
tights. 

So I think " The Ambassador " is the more 
literary : that is, it contains things that please 
me more as I read the plays over quietly at 
home, please me more than do various things 
about " The Princess and the Butterfly." Still, 
I doubt not that the latter play was the more 
successful on the stage (at any rate, it was suc- 
cessful enough to come over here, as " The 
Ambassador " has not yet), and very probably 
for the very things that are not wholly pleasing 
to one who only reads. 

In the Fifth Reader, or perhaps the Fourth, 
there used to be a tale about two sculptors who 
made two statues to go up and be set on a very 
high place. The reader may remember it : one 
statue seemed very coarse and rude till it got 
where it was intended to be ; the other, which 
was very charming and delicate when examined 
down below, lost a good deal when it was put 
in place. 1 think it is the same thing here. 
Mr. Pinero knows the stage better than Mrs. 
Craigie : he is somewhat conventional and con- 
fined, it is true, but he must know the stage. 
Ladies wear rouge on the stage and put black 
lines under their eyes, I believe, and do other 
things that would not render them attractive in 
the parlor ; and so do the men. I fancy that 
it may be that some of these things that we 
do n't like about Mr. Pinero may be necessary 
for the right effect across the footlights. 

But the others, the delicacies, the delight- 
ful half-tones, why must they miss their 
effect? Why can they never be put rightly

on the stage ? Why can they get no farther 
than to be realized by the kindly imagination ? 
Why should we not like them when we saw them 
in real flesh and blood? Even if the other 
things be necessary, why should we not have 
these too ? 

Be content, my dear insatiable ; your keenest 
pleasures, your most delightful half-minutes,

A ROUND-UP OF BOOKS OF THE WAR.* 

If students of history smile at the coloring given 
the facts in the war of 1812, where the retreat after 
Lundy's Lane is converted into a victory, and the 
sacking of York, the Canadian capital, is omitted 
in order to leave the British without reason for the 
reprisals at Washington, they will frown at the ex- 
posure of national weaknesses which make up most 
of the histories of the war with Spain. There is no 
place in the intelligent world of to-day for the sen- 
timent " My country, right or wrong," and there 
should be no place for the sensation-mongering with 
which an unscrupulous press is now contaminating 
our books. Of the many volumes relating to the war 
which have come from the pens of our soldiers and 
sailors, there is little complaint to be made ; they 
are for the most part sober, dignified, intelligent,

impartial, and painstaking. Of others prepared by 
civilians, whether in or out of the field, most of those 
hewed out by the swords of fighting journalists 
add new terrors of slander, untruth, partiality, 
suppression of vital facts, and vituperation to 
what, in General Sherman's profoundly truthful 
phrase, was already Hell. It is hardly needful to 
repeat here the fact, patent to everyone who glances 
at any of these volumes, that they are the raw ma- 
terial of history rather than history itself, the pro- 
toplasm from which time and patient study shall 
eventually bring something organic. So far, there 
appears to be hardly a suspicion of sources of 
information outside of our own country which must 
be consulted to insure accuracy of statement; and the 
prevailing assumption that there can be no other 
side to a controversy in which the United States 
is a party, is the final proof that these volumes are 
largely tentative and ephemeral. 

If there is any general fault in the books written 
by the various officers of our army and navy, it is 
that they are too long. Captain Sigsbee's account 
of the destruction of the " Maine," for example, 
could have been kept in half the space. There is 
in this work, too, an assumption of Spanish guilt 
which is not justified by tbe facts which have so far 
come to light, however strongly it may be inferred ; 
and there is a notable lack of information from that 
side, though it was at hand and available. But the 
story of the sinking of the great battleship has much 
merit as a bit of literary work. This is quite as 
true of Lieutenant Hobson's personal narrative of 
the sinking of the " Merrimac," in spite of his lack 
of reserve in describing the actual submergence of 
the vessel. But he dwells too long upon the minor 
matters of his imprisonment, making an anti-climax 
in spite of the thrilling scenes attending his return 
to his own flag. Had there been judicious suppres- 
sion in the account of his detention by Spain, the 
book would be nearly perfect ; even as it is, it de- 
serves wide circulation. If other naval officers can 
write half as well as these two, it is a pity that they 
are so ill-represented in our literature. 

Major-General Joseph Wheeler has limited him- 
self to a bare almost bald statement of fact, 
and to a reproduction of official reports from his 
own papers and those of his superiors and subordi- 
nates. His book on " The Santiago Campaign " is 
interesting in spite of this, and will increase in value 
with the years. Lieutenant John H. Parker was 
not only in command of " The Gatlings at Santiago," 
but it was due to him that there were any Gatlings 
there. What he has to say of machine-guns in the 
battle-line, and of their effect when opposed to artil- 
lery, is of real importance. Had all our officers 
been possessed of a tithe of Lieutenant Parker's zeal 
and intelligence there would have been fewer mis- 
takes. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Miley served as aide-decamp 
to the general commanding the expedition against 
Santiago, from the beginning to the end of the war. 
His book, " In Cuba with Shafter," has therefore

all the intimacy of a personal narrative and much 
of the importance of an official document. Bather 
with this and the foregoing books than with those 
of the professional journalists and compilers is to be 
ranked Mr. Stephen Bonsai's account of "The Fight 
for Santiago." All of these show General Shatter 
to be a patient, hard-working, thoughtful man, who, 
till he succumbed to illness which deserves pity 
rather than abuse, was doing the best he possibly 
could do under extreme disadvantages which were 
by no means of his making. 

It is well to remind the public here that the losses 
by sickness and mismanagement before Santiago 
were due chiefly to the deliberate inattention of Con- 
gress, for many years, to the needs of both army and 
navy. That preparation for war in the face of war 
is not only the least efficient but the most expen- 
sive preparation, has assuredly been clearly demon- 
strated ; but so great is the inertia of our people, that 
the new Congress will probably be found quite as 
incompetent to give us the skill and practice so sadly 
needed as these which have now left their shameful 
record behind. The evils of the spoils system, in 
which Congressmen from both houses played an unen- 
viable part, the unwillingness of the Administration 
to accept war as a probability or to stand out against 
an apportionment of military offices among mere 
politicians when there were trained soldiers kept in 
idleness, the favoritism in the navy which has led 
to such unnecessary wrangling and dispute, these 
are matters for the dispassionate hand of time to set 
down without fear and without malice. The thou- 
sands of ruined lives resulting from the expeditions 
in Cuba and Porto Rico were offered up on an altar 
of national ignorance and indifference erected long 
before the outbreak of hostilities an altar which 
has not yet been thrown down. 

In the face of these facts, and in the face of the 
books which have already been mentioned, it is im- 
possible to acquit Mr. Richard Harding Davis and 
Mr. John R. Spears of malice. In " The Cuban 
and Porto Rican Campaigns," the former is fairly 
scurrillous in his attacks upon General Shaf ter, while 
he exalts General Miles to a point which forces him 
to omit all mention of the illness which fell upon 
the soldiers in Porto Rico, though every whit as 
severe and extensive as that in Cuba ; while Mr. 
Spears, in " Our Navy in the War with Spain," 
makes a similar attack upon Commodore Schley, at 
the same time apotheosizing Admiral Sampson. 
Both journalists suppress and distort the facts to 
suit their ends, and both have written books which 
are to be classed as fiction rather than sober history. 

It may be well to add here that the insinuations 
of cowardice which are made against Shafter and 
Schley respectively are unsupported by any facts. 
In respect of Admiral Schley and Admiral Sampson, 
it must be remembered that both had served their 
country faithfully and without reproach up to the 
opening of the war with Spain, when Sampson was 
placed in command of one who was his senior and 
had been his superior officer during the War of the 



Rebellion. There both officers behaved as Amer- 
ican sailors have always behaved, though Sampson 
had the ill luck to lose the ship on which he was 
executive officer, the monitor " Petapsco," in 
Charleston harbor, a fact which may be looked for 
in vain in Mr. Spears's " History of Our Navy." 
Since the war, Sampson has presided over the des- 
tinies of the Naval Academy at Annapolis with 
dignity and decorum, has aided materially in bring- 
ing our ordnance to the point of efficiency shown in 
this war when in charge of the Ordnance Depart- 
ment, and, as Mr. Spears reminds us, has written 
an admirable paper on " The Naval Defence of 
Our Coast." Nothing is said of Schley's remark- 
able record, but it might have been told that he has 
landed blue- jackets in Central America, in Corea, 
and in the Cho-Sen Islands ; has cleared up the dif- 
ficulties with Chile ; has rescued the Greeley expe- 
dition to the North Pole, in short, has been in 
active and continuous service, doing deeds rather 
than writing essays or conducting experiments. It 
is not, then, the records of the two men which gave 
Sampson the position of commanding officer which 
availed him so little, as Mr. Spears disingenuously 
suggests. 

Mr. Goode, who was " With Sampson through 
the War " as correspondent of the Associated Press, 
is a little fairer than Mr. Spears and not quite so 
fond. His praise does not lack discrimination, but 
his partisanship is nevertheless complete. He sup- 
presses, for example, all mention of the dispatch 
from Sampson ordering Schley to hold his fleet off 
Santiago ; and, following Sampson again, he regards 
Schley's obedience to this order to be reprehensible. 
This is the more unpardonable, because Admiral 
Sampson has evidently supplied the writer with most 
of his material, including a chapter of his own. Mr. 
Goode, too, has his quarrel with Shafter, evidently 
by way of retribution for the General's criticism of 
the Navy. Yet the work shows painstaking, even 
to the extent of drawing upon the Spanish for 
information. 

"Campaigning in Cuba," Mr. George Kennan's 
account of services performed in connection with 
the Red Cross Society, is a vivid picture of suffer- 
ing and hardship, ameliorated in a considerable de- 
gree by the efforts of Mr. Kennan and his associates. 
The book, commendable in almost all respects, is 
injured by the persistency with which references to 
Siberian matters are dragged in, and far more by 
a determination to hold General Shafter responsible 
for all the calamities which fell under the writer's 
vision among the American soldiers. Both Colonel 
Miley and Lieutenant Parker disprove Mr. Ken- 
nan's statement that the lack of surgical attendance 
was due to the commanding general. 

The vivid account of " The Rough Riders " from 
the pen of Mr. Edward Marshall, the newspaper 
correspondent who achieved the distinction of being 
severely wounded while joining in a charge, is well 
worth reading, filled as it is with dramatic pictures 
by an eye-witness of the exciting events in the ca-

THE DIAL,

reer of that famous regiment. As is perhaps inevit- 
able in such a book, it lacks a sense of proportion. 
Without in the least reflecting upon the character of 
the work done by that excellent volunteer organiza- 
tion, there is here accorded a meed of praise which 
is surpassing in both quantity and quality. It is well 
to remember that not less than a thousand volunteer 
regiments, both North and South, were equally instant 
in performing their duty as they understood it dur- 
ing the Civil War. Let us not forget that we laughed 
at battles like Caney and San Juan when the Cubans 
and Spaniards were fighting two years or so ago, 
and that some notion of relative values must be pre- 
served or Gettysburg and the Wilderness will take 
on the dimensions of skirmishes. Mr. Marshall, too, 
has something to urge against Shafter, which rests 
more upon his mere averment than upon any facts 
he chooses to relate. 

The books remaining are of lesser moment, though 
having value as repositories of material. Mr. John 
C. Hemment is an expert photographer whose zeal 
carried him not only to Santiago but into the firing- 
line in search of subjects for his camera. To him 
are due many of the pictures that have given those 
at home so vivid a conception of the war, and it is 
in these pictures that the interest of his " Cannon 
and Camera" chiefly lies. Another abundantly 
illustrated book is " The Spanish- American War by 
Eye-Witnesses," compiled from original sources, 
chiefly the daily press. It is episodic, but of much 
interest, the materials being well chosen. Mr. 
Murat Halstead describes the battle of Manila in 
"The Story of the Philippines," styling himself 
"Historian of the Philippine Expedition." His 
voluminous work is encyclopaedic in its scope, but 
with neither alphabetical arrangement nor index. 
It also is illustrated. 

" A Short History of the War with Spain," the 
work of Mr. Marrion Wilcox, is an agreeable dis- 
appointment, being fair, comprehensive, succinct, 
and, considering the material at hand when it was 
put forth, accurate. " The War with Spain," by 
Mr. Charles Morris, is written down to the many, 
is filled with errors, and will be a real grief to those 
who welcomed his compendium of facts relating to 
our navy. General 0. 0. Howard, in " Fighting for 
Humanity," confines himself to the means taken for 
the christianization of American soldiers and sailors, 
and his book is of religious rather than warlike inter- 
est. It will supply some interesting paragraphs to 
the future historian. 

Though the war itself was waged with the wea- 
pons of civilization, the controversies which, have 
attended its close have the savor of those ill-smelling 
contrivances still in use, we believe, among the Chi- 
nese. It is to be hoped that unseemly partisanship 
in respect of such dissensions may give way to a 
spirit of reform, turning our national energies to 
the prevention of future scandals rather than to the 
reanimation of issues which need nothing so much 
as decent burial. JOHN j, CuLVER . 



RECENT POETRY.* 



The " Wessex Poems and Other Verses " of Mr. 
Thomas Hardy display much rugged strength and 
an occasional flash of beauty, but they are evidently 
nothing more than the literary diversions of a man 
who has cast his best intellectual effort in other 
moulds of expression. Yet at moments they exhibit 
qualities that almost persuade us a true poet was 
lost when Mr. Hardy became a novelist. Some- 
times it is merely a haunting phrase, such as " at 
mothy curfew-tide," that arrests our attention ; at 
others it is a longer passage of striking power, such 
a passage, for example, as this from the lines ad- 
dressed "to a lady offended by a book of the 
writer's ": 

" So be it. I have borne such. Let thy dreams 
Of me and mine diminish day by day, 
And yield their place to shine of smugger things ; 
Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams, 
And then in far and feeble visitings, 
And then surcease. Truth will be truth alway." 

Sometimes, again, although rarely, it is an entire 
poem, such as " Heiress and Architect," perhaps the 
strongest of all Mr. Hardy's pieces, too long to 
quote, and too compactly knit to bear dismember- 
ment. But we may find space for " Nature's Ques- 
tioning," which contains the essence of the poet's 
message. 

" When I look forth at dawning, pool, 

Field, flock, and lonely tree, 

All seem to look at me 
Like chastened children sitting silent in a school ; 

"Their faces dulled, constrained, and worn, 

As though the master's ways 

Through the long teaching days 
Their first terrestrial zest had chilled and overborne.

" And on them stirs, in lippings mere 

(As if once clear in call, 

But now scarce breathed at all) 
' We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here. 

" ' Has some Vast Imbecility, 

Mighty to build and blend, 

But impotent to tend, 
Framed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry ? 

" ' Or come we of an Automaton 

Unconscious of our pains ? . . . 

Or are we live remains 
Of Godhead dying downwards, brain and eye now gone ? 

"' Or is it that some high Plan betides, 

As yet not understood, 

Of Evil stormed by Good, 
We the Forlorn Hope over which Achievement strides ? ' 

" Thus things around. No answerer I . . . 

Meanwhile the winds, and rains, 

And Earth's old glooms and pains 
Are still the same, and gladdest Life Death neighbors nigh." 

This is one of the undated, and presumably later, 
poems ; its pessimism is that of " Tess " and " Jude 
the Obscure." But a similar note is struck in several 
pieces that bear the date 1866, which shows that 
Mr. Hardy has consistently maintained the same 
attitude toward the fundamental problems of exist- 
ence. More than thirty years ago he could pen such 
verses as these : 

" How arrives it joy lies slain, 
And why unblooms the best hope ever sown ? 
Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain, 
And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan . . . 
These purblind doomsters had as readily strown 
Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain." 

Of the " Wessex poems " proper we have said noth- 
ing, for they form the least interesting part of the 
collection. But there must be at least one word of 
mention for the simple and appropriate sketches 
made by the author himself to illustrate his poems. 
Mr. Maurice Hewlett's " Songs and Meditations " 
are dated more than two years back, but the vol- 
ume which contains them has only recently been 
sent us for review, an occurrence which we doubt- 
less owe to the large measure of popularity so de- 
servedly won by Mr. Hewlett's prose romance of 
last year. These poems are all that we should expect 
from the author of " The Forest Lovers " and 
" Earthwork out of Tuscany." They have a dis- 
tinction of manner and of phrase that is almost 
unfailing, and that at one moment suggests Mr. 
Henley, at another Patmore, and at still another 
our own Emerson. Yet no one could fairly charge 
Mr. Hewlett with being imitative, for his utterance 
is distinctly his own, as this " Dirge " witnesses : 

"How should my lord come home to his lands? 
Alas for my lord, so brown and strong ! 
A lean cross in his folded hands, 
And a daw to croak him a resting song. 

" And in autumn tide when the leaves fall down, 
And wet falls as they fall, drip by drip, 
My lord lies wan that was once so brown, 
And the frost cometh to wither his lip. 

" My lord is white as the morning mist, 
And his eyes ring'd like the winter moon : 
And I will come as soon as ye list 
O love, it is time ? May the time be soon ! " 



Here, in a very different measure, is an utterance 
even more original : 

" Man is a cage of pain, 
His thought is a pure thin fire 
That beateth against the bars 
And bonds of his grosser part, 
Astrain for the sky. And behold 
The flame roareth and rendeth, 
And the war nor stayeth nor endeth ! 

" Then at last when the bars 
Of the body shatter'd and torn 
Cleave asunder, the flame 
Winneth the bitter stars 
(Keener than scimitars), 
And man lieth prone in shame : 
Better not to be born ! " 

The elusive charm of such a poem as " Artemision " 
is not to be described, but the pleasure of feeling it 
is within the reach of every reader. 

" Now Winter stealeth out like a white nun, 
Cloaking her face behind her icy fingers, 
And men each day look longer at the Sun, 
While late and later yet the sweet light lingers. 

" Fast by the hedgerows, bit by gales of March, 
A chaplet for thy brows of delicate leaves 
Tendrils of briony, ruby tufts of larch, 
Wood sorrel, crocus pale, the New Year weaves. 

"Yet is thy smile half wintry, as forlorn 

To view thy state too solemn for thy years, 
And half amazed as a flower's, late born, 
And not more quick for pleasure than for tears. 

"Thy month austere telleth thy cloistral fashion : 
March frost thy pride is, March wind thy pent passion." 

We miss from this volume a very beautiful sonnet 
upon the Botticelli Madonna of the Uffizii, published 
in " The Athenaeum " several years ago. 

Nature and the soul of man, the solace of the 
one for the doubts and perplexities of the other 
these are the intertwined themes of Mr. Robert 
Burns Wilson's volume called " The Shadows of the 
Trees." This closing stanza of " A Walk with a 
Child " may be taken as a highly characteristic ex- 
ample of Mr. Wilson's work : 

" Come, I will cast this cloak of care aside, 
And break the world's false armour from my breast : 
His kingdom, from thine eyes, God doth not hide ; 
Come, we together, will go forth to rest, 
Somewhere secure wrapped in the sacred dream 

Which haply, waiteth still, 
Close nestled in the hollow of yon hill 
Amidst the drifting leaves. There shall the wild 
And inarticulate whisperings, once more, 
Speak, with unlying tongues. Once more the stream 
Shall sing of beauty which remaineth ever : 
No more shall bitter tears for lost endeavour 
Be known to us. All things that should have been, 
Shall vex us not. Thy steps shall go before 
Towards God's kingdom. On the hidden door 
Thy hand shall knock, and we shall enter in." 

The final philosophy of the poet finds its best ex- 
pression in this stanza from " Dust and Ashes ": 
" There be but two things which the soul may find 
On this sad earth, and, finding, should hold fast, 

The soul of beauty, which dwells in the mind 
And hence in all things, for all things are cast 
In our soul's proper measure ; and the last 

And best is love ; love truly can repay 



276 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



The heart's full sacrifice, for love, being past 

Leaves something with us that no fate can slay ; 
And if love linger till the end be here, 
What cause have we for sorrow then, what cause for fear ? " 

These two quotations afford sufficient evidence of 
the fact that Mr. Wilson's poetry is out of the com- 
mon, that it displays a deeper passion and a finer 
gift than most minor singers have at their command. 
We should like to enforce this proposition by nu- 
merous further extracts, but space forbids more than 
one other, a stanza from the poem which asks a 
question that often before this has put a too com- 
placent optimism to shame. 

" Would we return 

If love's enchantment held the heart no more, 
And we had come to count the wild, sweet pain, 
The fond distress, the lavish tears, but vain ; 
Had cooled the heart's hot wounds amidst the roar 
Of mountain gales, or, on some alien shore 
Worn out the soul's long anguish, and had slain 
The dragon of despair ; if then the train 
Of vanished years came back, and, as of yore, 
The same voice called, and, with soft eyes beguiling, 
Our lost love beckoned, through time's grey veil smiling, 
Would we return ? " 

One thing, and one only, about Mr. Wilson's vol- 
ume we regret. We find among the contents a 
battle song called " Remember the Maine." The 
sooner that discreditable phase of last year's war is 
forgotten, the better it will be for bur national 
reputation. 

The " Poems " of Mr. Philip Henry Savage are, 
for the most part, trifling and fanciful, although the 
light touch of the writer sometimes sounds a chord 
of deep feeling, as in these lines : 

" This crystal sapphire of the sky 
Is saner far than you and I, 
Who in our passions and our dreams 
Gun ever more to wild extremes. 

" The pure perfection of the sea 
Lies not in mirth and tragedy ; 
But like the silence of the snows 
In breadth of beauty and repose. 

u God give one moment, ere we die, 
As crystal clear as the blue sky, 
Serene as ocean, white as snow, 
And glowing as the heavens glow." 

Mr. Savage is often happy in his form of expres- 
sion, but not often as happy as this. 

" The Dream Beautiful," by Mr. C. H. Musgrove, 
is a small and not unpleasing volume of a conven- 
tional sort of verse. We are glad to reproduce 
" Cain, or Christ? " two quatrains written for Easter 
of last year, which express what so many thousands 
were feeling at that time. 

" Athwart the blazing ramparts of the day 

The white- robed hosts of peace come hand in hand, 
White palms and lilies strew the joyous way, 
And Christ, the risen King, smiles o'er the land. 

" Behind the sullen fortress of the night 

Cain's armed legions wait with feverish breath, 
While high above them, lost to mortal sight, 
Hover the black and steadfast wings of Death." 

Mr. William Norman Guthrie has approved him- 
self an essayist of sobriety and force, but he has not 



acquired freedom of motion when hampered by the 
restriction of rhyme and rhythm. Such lines as 
these 

" Dear moon. So white, so swift. 
That fliest from cloud to cloud 
Athwart each starry drift, 

How haughty and virgin-browed ! 
There clings about thy form 
A circle of hallowed light. 
It glides, and hides the swarm 
Of stars that would hide thy flight " 

are of the best that we can find in " A Booklet of 
Verse," a modest publication just put forth by Mr. 
Guthrie. 

Mr. Crockett's volume of lyrics called " Beneath 
Blue Skies and Gray " is one to be read with con- 
siderable pleasure, although the measures are some- 
what cloying in their sweetness, and a few senti- 
ments receive so much reiteration as to grow 
monotonous. The poet's inspiration comes almost 
wholly from natural beauty, which clearly means a 
great deal to him. His observation, too, seems usu- 
ally to have been faithful, although we cannot at 
all understand him when he writes of 

" The creek, where liriodendrons tall, 
Lift high their golden cups," 

and we are doubtful of the sense in which he means 
us to take the forced figure in 

" The mocking-bird is joyous there 
In wild parabolas of song." 

His best may be illustrated by this sonnet to 

" October." 

" Dim are the emeralds of dead Summer's crown, 
And to her throne, where rubies flash and glow, 
October comes with queenly step and slow, 
Pale asters braided in her tresses brown. 
The blue curled banners of the mist hang down, 
The milkweed bolls are white with silken snow, 
The thistle's silver argosies out-blow, 
And insect voices chant their Queen's renown. 
With tender eyes of happy, dreamful light 
She looks abroad on spreading fallow lands, 
On soft gray skies and wooded hillsides bright, 
The aged Year's offering in her outstretched hands : 
The partridge pipes a welcome leaping white 
The brook sings welcome from its leaf -strewn sands." 

Some pretentious occasional poems, in which the 
note is too forced to be altogether pleasant, a group 
of love songs and sonnets, often prettily done, but 
never more than that ; and a few pieces suggested 
by the war with Spain, form the chief contents of 
Mr. Hovey's lyrical collection called " Along the 
Trail." The things last mentioned come first in 
the volume, and, being mostly sound and fury, do 
not predispose to a favorable judgment of what is 
to follow. It is claimed, we believe, that the phrase 
"Remember the Maine," as it occurs in one of 
these pieces, is Mr. Hovey's own. If so, we wish 
him joy of it, and of the ignoble uses to which it 
has been put. We will illustrate his better work by 
means of the following sonnet : 

" My love for you dies many times a year, 

And a new love is monarch in his place. 

Love must grow weary of the fairest face ; 
The fondest heart must fail to hold him near. 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



For love is born of wonder, kin to fear 

Things grown familiar lose the sweet amaze ; 

Grown to their measure, love must turn his gaze 
To some new splendor, some diviner sphere. 
But in the blue night of your endless soul 

New stars globe ever as the old are scanned ; 
Goal where love will, you reach a farther goal, 
And the new love is ever love of you. 
Love needs a thousand loves, forever new, 

And finds them in the hollow of your hand." 

A set of translations from MaHamae" are about the 
most successful things in Mr. Hovey's new volume. 
They have no lasting value as poetry, but neither 
have their originals, and they do reproduce some- 
thing of the striking verbal effects at which the 
poet chiefly aimed. 

The pamphlet into which Mr. Armistead C. Gor- 
don has gathered a group of four occasional and 
memorial poems is so slight a thing in appearance 
that it might easily be overlooked. We are glad to 
call attention to it, for the quality of the verse is 
of a higher order than is usual in such productions, 
and is inspired by a deeper sentiment. In its mem- 
ories of the War, this verse is strongly Southern 
(or rather Virginian) in its sympathies. Here is a 
stanza, good as a whole, and made peculiarly im- 
pressive by the poignant pathos of the closing verse : 

" When came the bitter end, the bugle blew 

Its last sad note, that brought the blinding tears 
Down wasted cheeks from eyes that only knew 
Honor and Death through all the weary years. 
The long hard fight was done ; 
Silenced was every gun ; 
And what we lost, e'en now they do not dream, who won." 

One of the poems was written for the University of 
Virginia, and contains this fine tribute to the mem- 
ory of its founder. 

" One name, before which none in all time ever 
Hath been or shall be, shining there is writ : 

Worker of Revolutions, mighty giver 
Of Freedom's charter, and the Voice of it. 

When kingdoms shake, and iron empires fall, 

Through multitudinous time shall ring the clarion call 

" Of the eternal lesson that he taught : 
1 The gift of God is Freedom.' Never gift 
In all the ages with his promise fraught, 

Hath been bestowed like this one to uplift 
Mortality to godhood, and to light 
Man's pathway through the years till Time be put to flight." 

The sympathy which we felt for Mr. Kipling 
during his recent illness may fairly be matched by 
the sympathy that he at all times deserves for his 
sufferings at the hands of the parodists. Here, for 
example, is a volume called " Songs of Good Fight- 
ing," and the sort of thing it contains is almost 
wholly this : 

" We left a town where the sun stood slant on the fardled 

dead in the whetted square 
The murrey sun on a cruise foredone fluxed the West to a 

tawny glare, 
And a cozening wind coaxed at our sails, as we set forth to 

Otherwhere." 

The author of this volume appears to be a very 
bloodthirsty young person, and our slighting com- 
ment upon his work is made with some trepidation. 




" The Wayfarers " is the title of a book of song 
by Miss Josephine Preston Peabody. It is also the 
title of the opening poem, a sort of allegory of the 
spiritual pilgrimage, beautifully told and strangely 
impressive. Here is one stanza that will bear read- 
ing apart from the rest : 

" A red, red rose the early sun 

Came up, as glad as any guest ; 
A white, white rose whose bloom was done, 
The moon did wane unto the west. 
The waking fields breathed warm and stirred 
Small presences of song, half heard ; 

The wan stars closed against the day like flowers that fold 
them for their rest." 

It is a relief to find in this collection, after the wil- 
derness of lyrics and sonnets through which most 
minor poets bid us find a way, an attempt to do 
something else. We refer to a small group of 
" Idyls," Tennysonian or Landorian in their inspi- 
ration. Such verse as the following, while not re- 
markable, is sweet and satisfying. The subject is 
" Orpheus in Hades." 

" But when he came 

The trance of snow was troubled. Like the spring, 
I felt sweet stir of long-forgotten roots, 
Soft wakening in darkness, and afraid. 
Ever the air grew warmer, drew a breath 
Against the immortal heart-throb of the strings ; 
Till with some portent like a thunder-burst, 
My sleep was rifted. . . . There stood I, agaze, 
With them that gathered round him where he sang 
Bright as a torch in the bewildered eyes 
Of wistful hearers, pressing close, to melt 
The lonely peace away." 

In "The Song of Stradella," by Miss Anna 
Gannon, we have, to begin with, two longish poems. 
One of them gives the book its title, and the other 
is " A Dream of Shakespeare's Women," the charm- 
ing embodiment of a happy thought. We have also 
a number of simpler pieces, that display a moder- 
ate degree of poetic taste and sensibility. "A Song 
of Best " is a typical illustration. 

" I heard a song of rest so infinite 

That even thought was silenced, and a peace 
Fell on the spirit softer than the light 
Of quiet stars when dreary day shall cease. 

" Who hath not drifted to that fairy shore ? 

Who hath not longed to find that isle so blest, 

Where hope shall cheat and fate betray no more, 

And all life's fever turn to dreamless rest ? " 

Many of these pieces are reminiscences of scenes, 
persons, and books, gracefully obvious, and leaving 
no deep impression upon the memory. 

"The Immortals" is a small book of obituary 
poetry, devoted for the most part to singing the 
virtues of deceased Bostonians. A few outsiders, as 
Chatterton, Shelley, and Schubert, are admitted to 
this company, and all are extolled in hackneyed 
commonplaces that parade in the form of verse. 
There is no original beauty, no freshness of criti- 
cism, no inspiration in these pieces. Such lines as 
the following, inscribed to Shelley, which might have 
been written fifty years ago, are enough to make 
the poet turn in his grave : 



278 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



" Yea, verily there is a God in heaven : 
To know Him, unto thee it was not given. 
He yearned to draw thee to his mighty breast, 
And soothe thy weary, flattering heart to rest." 

A score or more of sonnets and sonnet-like poems, 
together with something like the same number of 
brief lyrics, make up the contents of a small volume 
of verse by Miss Helen Hay. It is verse that de- 
serves more than a perfunctory commendation, for 
it bears evidence upon every page of poetic sensi- 
bility and the artistic conscience. Miss Hay is 
clearly of those who work upon their verses until the 
first rough spontaneity is overlaid with the polish 
that betokens painstaking craftmanship, and then 
again until this polish is made so transparent that 
the first freshness reappears, softened and subdued. 
The lyric impulse is very strong in these pieces, 
often attuned to the chord of passion, yet rarely 
without the reflective element that makes of a poem 
something more than sensuousness alone. Let us 
take this sonnet for an illustration : 

" Kiss me but once, and in that space supreme 
My whole dark life shall quiver to an end, 
Sweet Death shall see my heart and comprehend 
That life is crowned, and in an endless gleam 
Will fix the color of the dying stream, 
That Life and Death may meet as friend with friend 
An endless immortality to blend ; 
Kiss me but once, and so shall end my dream. 
And then Love heard me and bestowed his kiss, 
And straight I cried to Death : I will not die ! 
Earth is so fair when one remembers this ; 
Life is but just begun ! Ah, come not yet ! 
The very world smiles up to kiss the sky, 
And in the grave one may forget forget." 

In these verses the passion is warm and throbbing ; 
how spiritualized another mood may make it ap- 
pears in the following sonnet, which we reproduce 
both for its own strange ethereal beauty and for the 
instructive contrast which it affords when set beside 
the other : 

" Ah, love, my love, upon this alien shore 
I lean and watch the pale uneasy ships 
Slip thro' the waving mist in strange eclipse, 
Like spirits of some time and land of yore. 
I did not think my heart could love thee more, 
And yet, when, lightlier than a swallow dips, 
The wind lays ghostly kisses on my lips, 
I seem to know of love the eternal core. 
Here is no throbbing of impassioned breath 
To beat upon my cheek, no pulsing heart 
Which might be silenced by the touch of Death, 
No smile which other smile has softly kissed, 
Or doting gaze which Time must draw apart, 
But spirit's spirit in the trailing mist." 

As for Miss Hay's lyrics, we are tempted to call 
them less lyrical than the sonnets. In other words, 
there is a marked reflective element in both her 
groups of pieces, and in the song proper this ele- 
ment should be felt rather than expressed as defi- 
nitely as it is here, at least in a few cases. But we 
would not close these comments without again indi- 
cating our sense of the finish and the distinction of 
Miss Hay's volume, which we wish were, and trust 
will in time become, a much larger one.

Democracy : ^he Poetical reformer, as well as the 

its evih and student of political philosophy, will 

their remedy. fin( j p ro f e88or James H. Hyslop's 

pungent and venturesome little study of " Democ- 
racy " (Scribner) decidedly interesting. Unlike 
Mr. Lecky and most recent critics of Democracy, 
Professor Hyslop does not content himself with 
fault-finding, with showing wherein and how griev- 
ously this form of government, which was ushered 
in with such salvos and plaudits and golden predic- 
tions a century ago, has fallen short of the millen- 
nial hopes formed of it. " Barking at the Devil," 
he says, " is not sufficient." He therefore not only 
points out (in a very plain-spoken and peppery way) 
wherein our political system is in its workings intoler- 
ably defective, but he grapples boldly with the much 
more difficult task of proposing specific remedies 
for the most crying defects. He offers for debate 
a set of apparently feasible remedial devices which 
go to form " a complete system of government which 
is neither a reaction toward monarchy, nor an ac- 
ceptance of the status quo" Professor Hyslop takes 
care to say that his scheme is not offered as an object 
of immediate practical politics, but only as a general 
conception to be borne in mind when proposing 
measures of reform. Broadly stated, the direction 
of political reforms should be, Professor Hyslop 
thinks, that of specializing the functions of govern- 
ment, simplifying those of the citizen, and of increas- 
ing the powers of the executive. The remedies he 
suggests, it must be added, are not in the direction 
of those popular nostrums, the referendum and the 
initiative which, however, he admits to be democ- 
racy's logical and natural consequences which may 
have to be allowed to develop their course. His 
plan may be regarded, then, either as a substitute 
for the referendum and the initiative, or as a remedy 
to be resorted to after these shall have been tried 
and found wanting. Briefly stated, Professor Hys- 
lop's plan is to enlarge the executive's appointing 
power, to curtail the power of removal through the 
establishment of an independent Court of Impeach- 
ment and Removal, and to modify the legislature's 
method of passing its laws. The " court of removal " 
he regards as the key to his entire system of reform. 
That system we cannot attempt to state here in de- 
tail, much less to discuss ; but we heartily commend 
it as well worth the study and consideration of our 
readers. It is not often that one finds a political 
treatise so thoughtful and philosophical, yet at the 
same time so practical, aggressive, and stimulating, 
as is this of Professor Hyslop's.

great minister is followed with fidelity from begin- 
ning to end. Any writer who attempts to do this 
in 500 pages mast sacrifice something : and Mr. 
Hume has sacrificed much. With every temptation 
to he picturesque, to describe, like Green, the En- 
glish people, to stir his readers' blood with the heroic 
achievements of that awakening age in which En- 
gland first found herself, he has resolutely stuck to 
his task. It was probably not easy writing, and it 
is rather hard reading : Cecil's cautious and self- 
seeking policy during the reigns of Edward VI. and 
Mary was essentially unheroic ; and his forty years of 
power under Elizabeth are splendid chiefly in their 
devotion to England's interest and William Cecil's 
advancement. The annals of a half-century's tor- 
tuous intriguing may be as tedious as those of that 
much prosperity ; and the fact that Lord Burghley 
lived safely through a period crowded with brilliant 
but disastrous careers vindicates his worldly wisdom, 
but withholds the meed of nobility. It was, indeed, 
as Macaulay has remarked, no place for a Riche- 
lieu : the sovereign was too masterful. Strange 
compound of her father's coarse violence and her 
mother's light vanity, Elizabeth Tudor had her own 
dower of sagacity ; and though she smiled on flat- 
terers, she always came back to the grave and pa- 
tient man who sat in her presence and gave her 
what she knew to be the best advice. She had 
many suitors, and talked always of marriage : but, 
Maiden Queen though she was and remained, she 
had an intellectual husband in her great Lord Treas- 
urer. He steered the ship of the realm with infinite 
skill and determination, by his own methods, through 
the troublous waters of threatened war with Spain, 
France, and Scotland : and the jibe of his enemies 
" regnum Cecilianum " was founded in fact. 
He saved Elizabeth from herself, often with no ac- 
knowledgment but complaint ; yet when she visited 
him in his sick-room, and the servant cautioned her 
to stoop on entering the low door, the Queen replied, 
" For your master only will I stoop, but not for the 
King of Spain." Mr. Hume's plan is, as above 
indicated, analytic, not descriptive. He steadily 
disentangles for our behoof the intricate web of 
manoeuvres, intrigues, plots and counter-plots, which 
made into one fabric English, French, and Span- 
ish affairs ; and has no space or but little 
for the story of the Armada, Mary of Scotland's 
execution, or the rise and fall of Ralegh. He has 
done his chosen work well and thoroughly, and ap- 
parently without prejudice ; and his estimate of 
Lord Burghley will probably command assent. 

Porto Rico is one of the choicest 
islands of the Greater Antilles. As 
a newly-acquired possession of the 
United States it has aroused almost universal inter- 
est. Located as it is on about the same parallels as 
Jamaica, it presents immense possibilities as a source 
of our tropical products. Mr. F. A. Ober's " Puerto 
Rico and its Resources " (Appleton) is an admirable 
compend of useful information about this charming 



little island. With good discrimination he discusses 
its commercial and strategic value, its coastal fea- 
tures, its climate, seasons, products, natural history, 
government, and people, and its history down to the 
present. With about 3,600 square miles of territory 
and more than 800,000 population, it presents few 
possibilities for anyone besides capitalists, tourists, 
and educators. Eighty-six per cent of its peoples 
more than one-half of whom are white, three- 
fourths of the remainder mulattos, and one-fourth 
blacks are entirely illiterate. The lack of trans- 
portation facilities, enough railroads, and good high- 
ways, limit the productivity of the soil, though it 
can readily grow under proper conditions almost 
any tropical product. Counterbalancing this lux- 
uriant tropical life are the evenness of the temper- 
ature, the humidity of the atmosphere, the frequency 
of storms and hurricanes. The evident work for 
the United States is to prepare good transportation 
facilities for the island, teach the Porto Ricans the 
possibilities of tropical agriculture, and to establish 
schools." The Porto Rico of To-day " (Scribner), 
by Mr. Albert Gardner Robinson, is a series of pen- 
pictures of the people and the country. In sixteen 
breezy chapters, the author sketches his experiences 
and observations in company with the military cam- 
paign which invaded Porto Rico last August. Life 
on a troop-ship, lack of organization in the " ag- 
glomeration " of soldiers which entered the island, 
personal encounters, and varied experiences during 
several weeks on the island, are appetizingly set 
before the reader. Mr. Robinson's observations on 
the future possibilities of the island are eminently 
sane, and cannot but do good among that restless 
class of people who are always plunging into risks 
with little or no capital. Amateur adventurers of 
any kind should read both of these books before 
rushing to Porto Rico. As set forth in these vol- 
umes, the field is an ideal one for foundation work 
in lifting up and training a susceptible and tractable 

people. 

We have already had occasion to 

Mr Jones'* plays express our opinion of the 8UCC6SS of 
in book form. H.-TT i i -r 

Mr. Henry Arthur Jones in serious 
drama, so far as literature is concerned. And we 
suppose that he must wish to have his plays regarded 
as literature: else why should he publish them? 
With the stage we have little to do : our readers 
have probably before this had occasion to form their 
opinions as to Mr. Jones's ability there. But an 
acted play is not literature, and we do not judge it 
as if it were. We are not in the habit of getting 
our literature viva voce : we get it in books. Other 
things we call " literary " pictures and plays, for 
instance ; but it is by a sort of figure of speech. The 
drama is a thing by itself ; it has its own canons 
and its own critics. But when a play is put into 
print, then it pretends to be literature, either is lit- 
erature or is not, for any one of us, as any one of 
us may decide. It is as foolish to judge a printed 
play by what it might be if it were acted, as it is to 
judge a play on the stage by what it might be if it

were printed. "The Rogue's Comedy " ( Macmillan) 
is, we imagine, better as a play to be read than as one 
to be acted, although Mr. Jones probably aimed at 
no such end. We recollect to have heard that it 
was by no means as successful as " The Liars," for 
instance. One of the reasons cfffered for its quali- 
fied failure was that it had no real love-story. This 
is practically the case : the play gives us the career 
of a charlatan, and the amusement comes mostly 
from its satire. Another thing that was probably 
ineffective on the stage was this : the charlatan's own 
son, who, never having known his father, has been 
successfully trying to expose him, brings matters to 
a head, and the fellow goes away without telling. 
The Rogue and his wife sail for America without 
discovering himself to his son, who marries the 
young lady and possibly finds out afterwards. This 
may not have pleased the audience. We think, 
however, that it will please the reader. At any 
rate, one will enjoy this play, and several more of 
Mr. Jones's things that are yet to be published. 
It must be remembered, though, that some of the 
volumes are not so good as others to put it mildly. 

Under the title of "Foot-Notes to 
Evolution " ( Appleton ) there has 
appeared from the facile pen of Pres- 
ident Jordan a volume of essays on evolutionary 
topics which presents even more than the title prom- 
ises ; for it sets forth in fresh and attractive guise, 
not some incidental jottings upon the subject, but a 
skilful treatment of the main theme in some of its 
most important phases. The various conceptions 
of the term " evolution " are discussed and objec- 
tions are vigorously raised against mistaken appli- 
cations of the word and illegitimate extensions of its 
scope. The doctrine of descent reappears as " The 
Kinship of Life," and " The Heredity of Richard 
Roe " is the text for a lucid and non-partisan pre- 
sentation and criticism of the theories of Galton and 
Weismann. Heredity, irritability, individuality, 
natural selection, self-activity, altruism, isolation, 
and inheritance are all recognized and discussed 
as elements of organic evolution. Professor E. G. 
Conklin contributes a chapter on the factors of 
organic evolution, in which he rejects both Weis- 
mann and Lamarck and counsels a return to Dar- 
win. Professor F. M. McFarland also adds a 
popular discussion of the physical basis of heredity, 
in which recent discoveries in cell-life and some 
of the latest speculations about the same are freed 
from their technicalities and elucidated for the gen- 
eral reader. President Jordan loses no opportunity 
to enforce the relation of biological laws and theo- 
ries to the questions of philosophy and to the un- 
solved problems of our modern civilization. The 
chapter on hereditary inefficiency is a strong protest 
against the perpetuation of crime and pauperism 
which our treatment of the delinquent classes now 
affords, and his discussion of the woman of pessim- 
ism and the woman of evolution is a vigorous pro- 
test, on biological grounds, against Schopenhauer's 



misogynous tirade. The breadth of view, the free- 
dom from the trammels alike of science and of 
dogma, the freshness and authenticity of the illus- 
trative data, and above all the pleasing style, render 
this book one of the best of the popular treatises 
upon this ever-interesting subject. 

An unaccountable Jt is hard to account for Mr. Justin 
history of the Huntly McCarthy's "Short History 

United Stales. of the United Stateg (R. S. Stone 

& Co.) except as an unusually desperate case of 
cram and potboiling. It is superficially conceived 
and crudely executed, and is often childish in its 
blundering incompetency. A more inadequate and 
misjudged sketch of the Civil War, for example, we 
do not remember to have seen. There is not even 
a coherent outline, and men and movements are 
jumbled together in an altogether hopeless muddle. 
All the disasters of the North in the first two years 
of the war are laid in a bundle upon the shoulders 
of one man McClellan. There is not a mention 
of Pope and his rout (the name is not even in the 
index ) ; Burnside and Fredericksburg receive a 
single line, and Chancellorsville is to this historian 
apparently unknown. Instead, we are told that 
" McClellan's removal happily handed the destinies 
of the armies of the North into the hands of greater 
men," and that with his disappearance " the story 
of the war took a new meaning and the fortune of 
the cause began to wear an unfamiliar brightness," 
the brightness, namely, of Fredericksburg and 
Chancellorsville, which succeeded the Union gloom 
of Antietam ! The reading of a single book written 
by his fellow-countryman, Colonel Henderson, might 
have saved Mr. McCarthy from blunders such as 
these. Minor blunders may be exemplified by the 
placing of Mr. Lincoln's second election after the 
close of the war in 1865 instead of 1864, and 
naming Fremont as the Republican nominee of that 
campaign. The gem of the book is perhaps in the 
chapter treating of our recent war on Spain, in which 
we are told that " Spain would do nothing, promise 
nothing, perform nothing for the better treatment 
of Cuba. All she would do was to declare war on 
the United States." It is depressing to think that 
any educated Englishman could suppose this to be 
the sort of stuff Americans wish to read. 



Recollections of a There is meat enough in the sizable 
British officer volume entitled " A Boy in the Pen-

to furnish out handsomely a half-dozen average 
military novels. While the incidents in the narra- 
tive (including the writer's own exploits) certainly 
lose nothing in the telling, its staple is truth, not 
fiction. The author is Robert Blakeney ; and he 
narrates in a very stirring and circumstantial way 
the story of his services, experiences, and adven- 
tures as a subaltern in the Twenty-eighth Regiment 
in the Peninsula with the allied armies against the 
French. Blakeney was of Irish birth and English 
blood, and he joined his regiment at the age of fif-

teen in 1804. During the next ten years he had 
fighting enough to last most men for a lifetime, and 
he could certainly bear witness to the truth of 
General Sherman's aphorism that " War is hell." 
His story of the storming and sacking of Badajoz 
(cleansed and softened as it is by the editor) is 
shocking beyond description. The British sol- 
diers got completely out of control of their officers, 
in whose sight (if we are to credit Blakeney) they 
perpetrated crimes inconceivable by a decent imag- 
ination. Blakeney left the army in 1828, and he 
seems to have spent the remainder of his life in 
administrative posts in the foreign civil service. 
He was for a time Health Inspector in the Island 
of Zante ; and it was during this period that the 
present memoir was prepared. The manuscript has 
been furbished up and prepared for the press by 
the author's son-in-law, Mr. Julian Sturgis ; and it 
is well worth the pains he has bestowed upon it. 
Notably interesting are the pen-pictures of Welling- 
ton and his officers, the story of the retreat through 
Spain to Corunna with Sir John Moore ; the ac- 
count of the death of that general, and of the bat- 
tles of Corunna, Barossa, Badajoz, etc. 

The pioneering * tne aterial means which have 
and building contributed to make the outward life 

of a railroad. o f to .d a y different from that of sixty 
years ago, certainly the railroad is foremost. Yet 
to the majority of people a vista of rails and ties 
and a train with its crew are about all the notions 
called up by the name. Mr. Warman, in his " Story 
of the Railroad " (Appleton), has endeavored to 
give a general idea of the vastness of the interests 
and the variety of the personnel involved in the 
great railroad systems of the West. And yet there 
are many phases of the work which he only hints at, 
as, for instance, the legislative management, 
which would make a couple of interesting volumes ; 
the financiering, of which Mr. Adams has told some- 
thing ; the operation, the most complex yet most 
perfect business mechanism in existence. In fact, 
it is the pioneering and the building of a railroad 
with which the book is chiefly concerned, and this 
in large measure the Atchison, Topeka & Santa 
Fe. There is adventure and romance enough con- 
nected with the building of any great transconti- 
nental railroad, but probably the Santa Fe had more 
than its share of these elements. As a consequence, 
Mr. Warman's recital, liberally illustrated as it is, 
is a fascinating story which ought to be much pre- 
ferred to a novel by those who want " a true story." 

The recollections of General Count 
The struggle for Enrico Delia Rocca, embracing the 

period from 1807 to 1893, are chiefly 
occupied with the important events of the struggle 
for Italian unity. General Rocca was in an excep- 
tionally favorable position to know whereof he has 
written, since he himself took a prominent part in 
the contest, having been intimately associated with 
King Victor Emanuel as his chief of staff, and

intrusted with several delicate diplomatic missions. 
His " Autobiography of a Veteran " (Macmillan) is 
accordingly an interesting contribution to the his- 
tory of the period. The book is remarkable in the 
fact that, although it is a record of matters in which 
the author had a leading part, it is singularly free 
from the vitiating influence of personal bias and from 
harsh criticisms of opponents. Remarkably supe- 
rior to jealousy, General Rocca was able to honor 
Cavour and to be just to Garibaldi and Mazzini. 

The Countess Cesaresco has written 
a very interesting account of the life 
and work of the great Italian diplo- 
matist and statesman, Cavour, which forms a vol- 
ume of the " Foreign Statesmen " series ( Mac- 
millan) . Not too much has been attempted by the 
author, and enough has been done to furnish within 
the limits of 220 pages an account of the career, 
from early youth, of the man to whom, more than 
to any other, Italian unity is due an account which 
will meet the requirements of the general reader. 
While the student of history will naturally have 
recourse to Cavour's correspondence and the pub- 
lished documents which throw light on his career, 
readers who wish a vivid presentation of the man as 
he lived and worked will find this book exceedingly 
interesting and profitable. The side-lights thrown 
upon contemporary history, and Russian, Austrian, 
French, and English diplomacy, constitute an attrac- 
tive feature of the work. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" The French Revolution and the English Poets " 
(Holt), by Dr. Albert Elmer Hancock, is unfortunate 
in the fact that, although completed before the appear- 
ance in book form of Professor Dowden's lectures upon 
exactly the same subject for the Princeton Sesquicen- 
tennial, its publication has been delayed until now. As 
the work of a beginner in criticism, it would not be 
fair to institute any comparison at all between this 
book and its predecessor in point of publication, let 
us rather say that the present work is so well done 
that we have read it with much satisfaction, and that 
our shelves have room for it as well as for Professor 
Dowden's volume. Professor Lewis E. Gates contri- 
butes a few introductory pages to the book. Indeed, 
what with the dedication to Professor Wendell, and the 
further miscellaneous acknowledgements of the preface, 
the trail of Harvard is over the whole no very bad 
thing for a book, all things considered. 

" The Rights and Duties of American Citizenship," 
by Dr. W. W. Willoughby, is a school-book of more 
than ordinary value recently published by the American 
Book Co. The book has two sections, the first devoted 
to the elements of political science in general, and the 
second to a description of civil government, both na- 
tional and local, in the United States. The author is 
fully abreast of the most progressive methods of dealing 
with these subjects, and his work is sound, practical, 
and compact. Our only criticism is that there does not 
seem to be quite enough matter in the book to fit it for 
use in the higher schools for which it is intended.

THE STORY OF 

The Rough Riders 

By EDWARD MARSHALL. 

The most intensely interesting book of modern times. The 
author, correspondent of the New York Journal, was a par- 
ticipant with the " Rough Riders," and was severely 
wounded by a Mauser bullet while at the extreme front of 
the firing line at Las Guasimas. His book is thrillingly inter- 
esting. It is devoted entirely to 

THE ROUGH RIDERS, 

The best Regiment of Volunteer Soldiers ever organized. 

The first to land in Cuba, who raised the first American 
flag, flown by the Army, on Spanish soil, and headed one of 
the most desperate charges in the history of warfare. Mr. 
Marshall's ability as a writer is widely known. His " Story 
Of the Rough Riders " is the best work he has ever 
done. It is by no means a history, although the greatest pains 
have been taken to make it accurate. It is full of anecdote 
and episode, and tells the story with a breezy freedom and 
dashing rapidity which is like that of the regiment itself on 
the battlefield. The personalities of many of its members, 
officers and privates, are vividly portrayed. It contains a 
complete Roster of the Regiment. 

"Mr. Marshall tells the history of this celebrated organiza- 
tion from its formation in Texas to the day it was mustered 
out in New York." New York Press. 

"It is one of the most intensely interesting books of the 
day." Albany Times Union. 

" It will stand unique and interesting among the books re- 
sulting from the late struggle with Spain. It is written in the 
clear and graphic fashion of the trained newspaper worker, 
written by one who saw more than the mere details which 
make common-place histories." New York World. 

" Enscrolled with emblematic colors of fidelity, constancy, 
and courage, shines fadelessly the entries of those horseless 
riders, that dismounted chivalry of knighthood, the First 
United States Volunteer Cavalry, which more than any other 
regiment opened to civilization the unwilling gates of Santi- 
ago. There is nothing Americans admire so much as pure 
pluck, and in any suffrage. Edward Marshall's name would 
lead in that quality. His ' Story of the Rough Riders ' has 
the authority, the conciseness, the piquant style, of the good 
reporter." Newport News. 

"No European who has had an opportunity to study the 
Rough Riders, fails for a second to appreciate the American 
soldier. It would be madness to back the English, German, 
or French fighting machines against men like those in the 
First Volunteer Cavalry." Captain Lee, English Military 
Attache. 

" It is a book which the members of that famous regiment 
and their innumerable friends will want to read, for the name 
on the title page is a guaranty that the story is told in a sym- 
pathetic spirit and with brilliant effects. Its power of realism 
stands alone in the literature of the Spanish war." New 
York Evening Sun. 

" Immediately interesting and destined to be of great value 
to the historian when he shall come later to his task. It is 
written with the verve and fluency of a newspaper report ; 
but, it bears internal evidence of a very conscientious accur- 
acy." George Gary JEggleston, in the New York World. 

"Few contributions to the literature of our time are more 
worthy of the attention of Americans than this book the 
plain tale of grand deeds done by their countrymen." The 
Criterion.

New Testament Churchmanship 

And the Principles upon which it 
was Founded. 

By the Right Rev. HENRY YATKS SATTERLEE, D.D., 
Bishop of Washington. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
The aim of this book is to show that Baptism, the 
Eucharist, the Visible Church, the Christian Priesthood, 
and other Church principles are set forth in the New 
Testament as inseparably connected with Christ's Res- 
urrection and Ascension ; that both Romanism and Pro- 
testantism, by stopping at the Crucifixion and losing 
the true meaning of the Resurrection and Ascension, 
have failed to realize the relationship of the Glorified 
Christ to His Church, and have thus fallen below the 
level of New Testament Churchmanship.

England in the Age of Wycliffe. 

By GEORGE MACAULAY TREVELYAN, B.A., Fellow of 
Trinity College, Cambridge. 8vo, $4.00. 
The object of this volume is to give a general picture 
of English society, politics, and religion, at a certain 
stage in their progress. It recounts also the leading 
and characteristic events of the same period in English 
history . . . the meeting point of tie mediaeval and the 
modern, and so of peculiar interest. Mr. Trevelyan 
bases his work on original authorities, many of which 
have now been unearthed for the first time in the Public 
Record Office and the British Museum.

Pictures of Life in Armenia. 

By AVETIS NAZARBEK, Editor of the Huntchak. Trans- 
lated by Mrs. L. M. ELTON. With a Prefatory Note 
by F. YORK POWELL, Regius Professor of History in 
the University of Oxford. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 
" The case of Armenia obviously claims attention, and it is for the 
purpose of forwarding this claim to the attention of the Western Euro- 
pean and American public that the author of this book has written. 
He has a right to speak, for he is familiar with the facts of the matter, 
and has an almost unique knowledge of the causes, progress, and aims 
of the late revolt of a large section of his countrymen against the 
Turkish Government. . . . He writes frankly from the Armenian point 
of view, but his stories are none the less based upon fact. He has known 
personally most of the characters he draws ; the opinions they express 
and those they actually held ; the adventures they go through are real 
experiences of his friends and kinsfolk." 

EXTKACT FROM PREFACE BY F. YORK POWELt. 



LONGMANS, GREEN, & CO., Publishers, 91=93 Fifth Ave., New York. 



By ALICE LOUNSBERRY. Illustrated by Mrs. ELLIS ROWAN. 

With an Introduction by Dr. NATHANIEL L. BRITTON. 

With 64 beautiful full-page COLORED plates, showing 79 different plants, and 100 black-and-white plates 

showing 103 plants, together with 54 diagrams. Better illustrated than any similar book. Makes reading 

a pleasure. 

Contains descriptions of nearly 500 plants, many more than any similar book. 

Many of America's most beautiful and unusual flowers, found in no other popular work, are given here. 
It is complete in itself, employing no technical terms that it does not define, and requiring no other book to 

make it intelligible. 

Condensed and free from padding, it is not too large to be a handy companion in the woods, field, and roads. 
Arranged according to the kind of Soil in which plants grow, the most natural classification. Family, Color, 

Odor, Range, and Time of Bloom are all given in each case. Indexes of Common Names, Scientific Names, 

and Colors aid in making identification easy. 

As a text-book for the instruction of beginners children or adults the book is unexcelled. 
While enjoyable and readable, it is strictly correct and in accordance with the latest scientific research. 
Non-botanists will enjoy it as much as botanists, and will learn much with little effort. 
Mrs. Rowan is the world's greatest painter of wild flowers. She has won more medals than are possessed by 

any other woman, and she recently refused $75,000 offered by the German Government for her collection. 

Her drawings are from the fresh flowers in or near their homes. While artistic and beautiful they are 

technically correct. 
Dr. Nathaniel L. Britton, Director of the New York Botanical Garden, Emeritus Professor of Botany, Columbia 

University, and author of " An Illustrated Flora," has made suggestions for the scientific part of the text 

and has written an introduction.

Miss Dougall has handled her subject with consummate skill. . . . She

and has succeeded in furnishing a story whose scope broadens with each 
succeeding chapter until the end." New York Mail and Express. 

'"The Mormon Prophet' is no less interesting than curious ; and

MISS FOWLER'S NEW NOVEL. 

A DOUBLE THREAD. 

By ELLEN THORN YCROFT FOWLER, author of " Concerning 

Isabel Carnaby," etc. 12mo. cloth, $1.50. 

The brilliancy of " Concerning Isabel Carnaby " is accentuated in 
this new novel, which, moreover, will be found to represent even more 
distinctly a story-telling purpose. There is a peculiar plot, with certain 
most unexpected developments, and the author's ingenuity in construc- 
tion is no less apparent than the wit, incisiveness, and intense modernity 
of her dialogue. The new novel deals for the most part with English 
country-house life. 

IDYLLS OF THE SEA. 

By FRANK T. BULLEN, author of " The Cruise of the Cach- 
alot," etc. $1.25. 

The success which Mr. Bullen has won by the force and vividness of 
" The Cruise of the Cachalot" imparts a special interest to the announce- 
ment of his forthcoming book, " Idylls of the Sea." This book sketches 
various phases of the life and experiences of those who go down to the 
sea in ships. It is not confined to the whaler's exploits, but includes 
the things which are seen and the adventures which are undergone by 
all manner of men upon the sea. The keen observation and dramatic 
quality of the author's first book are vividly illustrated in this fasci- 
nating volume. 

LOVE AMONG THE LIONS. 

By F. ANSTEY, author of " Vice Versa," etc. Illustrated. 

12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

This delicious little comedy is a happy illustration of the unexpected 
turns of Anstey's quaint humor. The plot must be discovered by the 
reader and not betrayed prematurely. The illustrations are in har- 
mony with the text. The novelette represents Anstey at his best, and 
it will be found an excellent promoter of good spirits.

THE ENDOWED THEATRE. 

The recent visit of Mr. William Archer to 
this country, for the purpose of making a close 
study of theatrical conditions on our side of the 
Atlantic, will doubtless result in a highly in- 
structive series of papers for the English peri- 
odical which commissioned him to make the 
investigation, and has already called fresh 
attention to, and evoked fresh discussion of, a 
number of old questions connected with the 
art of the dramatist and theatrical manager. 
Mr. Archer is himself peculiarly well-equipped 
for such a task as he has undertaken. Among 
English dramatic critics he occupies the fore- 
most place. He has both knowledge and so- 
berness, and these qualities combined make 
him a far more significant writer of dramatic 
criticism than the effeminately whimsical 
Mr. Beerbohm, the sensationally sentimental 
Mr. Scott, and the audaciously paradoxical Mr. 
Shaw. Even the writing of Mr. Walkley, 
brilliant and fascinating as it is, lacks the 
solidity of Mr. Archer's criticism, because it 
does not seem to be as firmly based upon the 
fundamental principles of dramatic art, or as 
widely conversant with the modern literature 
of the play. 

Among the many evils connected with the 
English-speaking stage of our own time, Mr. 
Archer marks out the " actor-manager," the 
" star system," and the " long run " for his most 
emphatic denunciation. In the address which 
he gave in this country before the Twentieth 
Century Club of Chicago and Columbia Uni- 
versity of New York, he sought to answer 
the question, " What can be done for the 
drama ? " and bore down upon these three evils 
with much weight. We imagine, however, that 
for his audiences upon these two occasions he 
was slaying the slain, for our cultivated public 
hardly needs to be persuaded that stars and 
long runs and actor - managers are directly 
inimical to all artistic endeavor for the better- 
ment of our theatrical conditions. We are 
as familiar as Englishmen are with the bad 
influence of these things, or, if we have not 
suffered as much from the actor-manager, we 



296 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



have for our very own the additional evil of 
the " theatrical syndicate," which more than 
tips the scale (this to be taken ironically) in 
our favor. 

We must, however, hasten to dislodge from 
the minds of our readers the notion that Mr. 
Archer was merely destructive in his criticism. 
Nothing could be farther than this from the 
truth. Unlike Mr. Zangwill, our English vis- 
itor of six months ago, who dealt with the same 
general subject of the low theatrical estate of 
England and America, Mr. Archer had definite 
things to propose. And if his address was 
without the pointed epigrams and the flashes 
of humor that made Mr. Zangwill so entertain- 
ing a speaker, it provided ample compensation 
for the lack of those superficialities in its ra- 
tional suggestions, enforced as these were by 
examples of what other countries have actually 
" done for the drama." In a general way, Mr. 
Archer was for the establishment of an endowed 
theatre, but with a difference from the usual 
speculations upon this subject, in that the sug- 
gested endowment was to be private rather than 
municipal, a matter for the voluntary enterprise 
of subscribers rather than for the forced enter- 
prise of tax-payers. Considered from the point 
of view of probability, we agree with Mr. 
Archer in looking forward to a private rather 
than a public endowment, although we think 
it would be entirely proper for the municipality 
to act in such a matter. And we need hardly 
remind our readers that THE DIAL has always 
advocated the endowed theatre, as it has always 
urged the desirability of the endowed newspa- 
per. One of these days, moreover, the idea is 
going to take practical shape in the mind of 
some philanthropist, who will prefer to make 
his gift to the public in this way rather than 
to establish a new hospital or art gallery or 
public library. 

Mr. Archer spoke at considerable length of 
the successful way in which certain German 
theatres notably the Deutsches Theater of 
Berlin and the Volkstheater of Vienna have 
dealt with this problem of supplying the " inner 
public" the public which wants good art, 
which demands that ideas shall be set above 
accessories in its plays with its dramatic en- 
tertainment. There is no reason why such 
theatres, the product of endowment and sub- 
scription, should not be duplicated in our own 
country, and even prove successful as commer- 
cial enterprises, no reason, that is, unless it be 
that our own "inner public" is not large enough. 
There is the rub, no doubt. The German pub- 



lic, the French public, the Italian public, the 
Scandinavian public, all contrive, in any city 
of considerable or even moderate size, to sup- 
port a stage in healthful activity, and this is 
just what the English public has hitherto failed 
to do. They have a good inherited tradition ; 
we have cared so little for ours that we have 
lost it altogether. Mr. Henry Fuller, who has 
recently been saying some unpalatable things 
about our lack of artistic aptitudes, would prob- 
ably observe (in his not too serious way) that 
it is not in us, racially or temperamentally, 
really to care for dramatic art, or to foster it 
in the fashion of the Continental peoples. Per- 
haps it is not ; but the experiment is worth try- 
ing, and as long as it remains untried, we shall 
have hopes. The saving element of the situa- 
tion may not impossibly come from the fact 
that we are not as English a people as our name 
implies ; that we have so much admixture of 
other strains as to make the case a new one, 
not to be judged by the analogies of the past. 
Our immigrants often practice segregation 
themselves, but their children become pretty 
well blended into the common American nation- 
ality, and who can tell a priori just what apti- 
tudes and potentialities will characterize the 
resulting race. 

What we want of our stage, and what we 
believe will be given us at no distant day, at 
least in our largest cities, by endowment or 
otherwise, is, in a word, this : We want a play- 
house with no stars, no popular successes, no 
waste in the form of expensive unessentials. 
We want upon the boards of this playhouse a 
body of trained and conscientious actors, capa- 
ble of playing many parts every year, bound 
to the institution both by loyalty to its funda- 
mental idea and by such material inducements 
as shall insure an honorable career and a com- 
fortable retirement. We want this playhouse 
to have a repertory of the most varied sort, 
catholic enough to include every genre of mer- 
itorious dramatic writing, but rigorously ex- 
cluding what is sensational, childish, or merely 
vulgar. We want it to present the classical 
drama of English and foreign literatures fre- 
quently enough to give those who wish it an 
opportunity to become acquainted with the mas- 
terpieces of ancient and modern dramatic art. 
We want it to be constantly on the lookout for 
promising works by new writers, extending to 
them the frankest recognition, yet never mak- 
ing a fad of any one of them, or any school of 
them. We want it to be both grave and gay, 
a place to which we may resort for diversion 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



297 



and for edification alike. We want it to be a 
place in which young persons may learn some- 
thing about life, and acquire standards of taste, 
yet a place from which young persons should 
sometimes be excluded, not by administrative 
prescription, but rather by the judgment and 
discrimination of their elders. Finally, we want 
it to be a place in which, while nothing is neg- 
lected that will heighten the legitimate interest 
of the drama, ideas shall be paramount to all 
other considerations in the selection and the 
mounting of the pieces to be produced. 

It does not seem to us that the plan thus out- 
lined is beyond the range of the immediately 
practicable. In New York and Chicago cer- 
tainly, in Boston and Philadelphia possibly, the 
public that desires such a theatre is large 
enough to justify its establishment. There must 
be thousands of people in those cities who would 
support such a theatre to the extent of from 
ten to one hundred dollars each, every year. 
What is needed is the organizing power neces- 
sary to bring these people into cooperation, 
with possibly the stimulus of the provisional 
gift of a site and a building. We notice that 
Mr. Howells, while commenting on the whole 
favorably upon this suggestion, seems to think 
that the well-to-do class of people who would 
control the management of such a theatre might 
impose a censorship inimical to the free devel- 
opment of the drama. " In a theatre founded 
or controlled by them, no play criticising or 
satirizing society could be favored," he says, 
and instances " An Enemy of the People," 
"Arms and the Man," "Die Weber," and " Die 
Ehre," as plays that could not hope for pre- 
sentation. This seems to us the merest bug- 
bear, and the force of the criticism is certainly 
not increased by the reference to " what has 
happened in some of our higher institutions of 
learning." Mr. Howells makes a much hap- 
pier suggestion when he finds an analogy 
between the subscription theatre and the sub- 
scription lecture organizations which exist in 
many parts of the country, and which, for a 
moderate fee, give themselves " the pleasure of 
seven or eight lectures during the season, from 
men who are allowed to speak their minds. 
With a subscription of twenty-five dollars they 
could have as many plays, from dramatists 
who also spoke their minds ; and if the experi- 
ment were tried in ten or twenty places, we 
should have at once a free theatre, where good 
work could make that appeal to the public 
which it can now do only on almost impossi- 
ble terms." 



THE " DIAL" OF 1840-45. 

There is hardly a more interesting episode in the 
history of American periodical literature than that 
formed by the conception, rise, and fall of the mag- 
azine called " The Dial," covering the period from 
1840 to 1845. This short-lived hopeful of litera- 
ture is not to be ranked with the ephemera, but 
holds some such place in the history of American 
magazines as the young Marcellus and Sir Philip 
Sidney occupy in the history of men : fascinating 
the imagination by the appeal of brilliant promise, 
early death, and pathetic unfulnlments. Like that 
other renowned periodical, " The Germ," which was 
started on the other side of the Atlantic just a de- 
cade later, it began as the organ of a coterie. What 
" The Germ " was to Pre- Raphael! tism in Great 
Britain, that " The Dial " was to Transcendentalism 
in New England. If the first issue of " The Germ " 
contained Rossetti's " Blessed Damozel," " The 
Dial " was launched with the equally characteristic 
though less precious freight of Emerson's " Prob- 
lem" and " Woodnotes." One aimed to be the 
germ, the other to be the dial of " a movement." 

" The Dial " began as the organ of a coterie and 
a movement, and it never became anything more. 
It was never, in fact, successful in meeting the intel- 
lectual necessities, even of those with whom it orig- 
inated. Yet, on account of the very impracticable 
and too ambitious character of its aspirations, it all 
the more typified and expressed the movement with 
which it was connected. To some of its promoters, 
indeed, it seemed to fly too high ; to others it seemed 
of the earth, too earthy. Its plans were broad and 
diverse, but its material capital was very limited ; and, 
while aspiring to give expression to all sides of the 
restless activities of mind and spirit which drew to- 
gether Emerson, Alcott, Parker, and other divergent 
sympathizers, it was frequently compelled to print 
what it could get or depend largely on the writing of 
some individual, now one and now another. Thus, it 
failed of the breadth aimed at, while at the same time 
it lacked unity and consecutiveness of character and 
purpose. As a result, the ambitious Protean flopped 
about mightily for four years, and then expired. In 
its giant throes it showed as many brilliant colors 
as the dolphin ; but it was out of water from the 
first, and seems never to have had in it the possi- 
bility of living. 

The natural desire which enthusiasm has for 
sympathy and for expression resulted in the forma- 
tion, at Cambridge, in 1836, of a club of the more 
independent thinkers and vigorous spirits who then 
and there came across one another. Transcendental- 
ism, as it has long been called, had been in the air 
for some time. A number of youthful enthusiasts, 
readers of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, the 
first apostles of Carlyle, and ardent students of Ger- 
man philosophy, young fellows of unusual brilliancy 
and intellectual aggressiveness, graduated from Har- 
vard College in the years from 1832 to 1836. Many 
of them were budding Unitarian preachers. Most 



298

[May 1, 



of them were looking for greater spirituality than 
had hitherto been characteristic of American thought. 
Their interests were varied theological, social, 
political, literary; but this they had in common, 
that they were young, enthusiastic, generous, and 
strongly American. They wanted " life," and 
wanted it "more abundantly" than it had been 
vouchsafed them in the conventional religion and 
literature of the times. These young theorizers 
naturally looked about for an opportunity to express 
themselves in their own way, which was, in general, 
a new way, a free way, and not in accord with the 
spirit and method of the established journals. Thus, 
among them the subject of a literary club which 
should publish a magazine of its own became a sub- 
ject of correspondence as early as 1833. This dis- 
cussion grew animated in 1835 ; but subsided with 
the removal to Bangor, Maine, of the Rev. F. H. 
Hedge, who had corresponded freely with Margaret 
Fuller upon the subject. 

It was after the bi-centennial celebration of Har- 
vard College, in 1836, that Emerson, Hedge, Rip- 
ley, and Putnam, four young Unitarian ministers, 
got into some discussion of the narrow tendencies of 
thought in the churches. They " talked the matter 
over at length "; and this consultation led to another, 
the following September, at the house of George 
Ripley in Boston, where they were reinforced by 
Theodore Parker, 0. A. Brownson, and others, 
among them two remarkable women, Margaret 
Fuller and Elizabeth Peabody. Thus began the 
meetings of an informal club, afterwards known 
among its members as " The Hedge Club." It was 
also occasionally known, as in Alcott's diary, as the 
" Symposium," and to the world at large its mem- 
bers were herded under the title of " The Trans- 
cendentalists." For some years the club continued 
to meet in a peripatetic way, now at Concord, with 
Emerson ; now, for the sake of Dr. Convers Francis, 
in Watertown ; and sometimes in Boston. 

The idea of a journal was in their thoughts from 
the first, and was urged with especial vigor by 
Alcott, who desired an outlet for his " Orphic Say- 
ings," and other idealistic and Delphic " Scrip- 
tures." A model was found in the "New Monthly 
Magazine," published in England by an eccentric 
character, one Heraud, who was ridiculed by Carlyle 
and Leigh Hunt, and "forgiven" by J. S. Mill, 
" for interpreting the universe, now that I find he 
cannot pronounce the <h's.'" The fact that this 
periodical made a shift to live seems to have nour- 
ished the hopes of Alcott and others for a journal 
of the " Spiritual Philosophy." Frequent mention 
of the new organ occurs toward the close of 1839, 
and " the proposed ' Dial,' " a title which Alcott 
used for parts of his diary, was discussed by Mar- 
garet Fuller at the " Symposium " of September 18. 
The urgent efforts of Mr. Brownson to merge the 
enterprise with his " Boston Quarterly," and, instead 
of publishing " The Dial," to open the pages of the 
"Quarterly" to these new writers, was rejected, 
apparently because Brownson's review was " pledged 



to a party in politics," and took " too narrow ground 
both in philosophy and literature." A letter of 
Miss Fuller's, dated January 1, 1840, and addressed 
to the Rev. W. H. Channing, speaks of the first 
number as practically assured for April 1. She 
concludes : " At Newport you prophesied a new 
literature : shall it dawn in 1840 ? " During the 
next few months we find her industriously whipping 
in the contributors ; and though this was not accom- 
plished in time to publish in April, the prospectus 
came out early in May, and the first number was 
issued July 1, from the press of Messrs. Weeks, 
Jordan & Co., Boston, under the editorship of Miss 
Fuller, with George Ripley as assistant. 

The first number of "The Dial" contained an 
"Introduction to the Readers" by Emerson, and 
two poems, one of them his now familiar poem be- 
ginning, 

" I like a church, I like a cowl." 

There were also two poems by Thoreau ; poems by 
Emerson's brother and sister ; an article of thirteen 
pages on " The Divine Presence in Nature and the 
Soul," by Theodore Parker; several poems by C. P. 
Cranch and others ; a reyiew of Brownson's writings 
by Ripley ; Chapter I. of Channing's " Ernest the 
Seeker"; Alcott's "Orphic Sayings"; half a dozen 
articles, mostly critical, by Miss Fuller herself ; and 
some others. As time went on, one or two con- 
tributors were added to the list ; but this volume 
may be considered as fairly typical. Lowell, later, 
gave them a few sonnets ; W. E. Channing contri- 
buted some of his verses and was discussed in a crit- 
ical notice in the second number. James Freeman 
Clarke, also, wrote for some of the later numbers. 

Few were satisfied with the first number of " The 
Dial." In the first place, there were some melan- 
choly errors in typography one of Thoreau's poems 
was especially mangled. Naturally, also, there were, 
even among transcendentalists, degrees of transcen- 
dentalism. Alcott, for example, represented the ex- 
treme of mysticism, and wanted too much of what 
Carlyle called a " potato-philosophy." There was 
not sufficient departure from accepted standards and 
conventional modes of expression to suit him. He 
wrote, in the true " Orphic " vein, to Heraud : " ' The 
Dial ' partakes of our vices, it consults the mood 
and is awed somewhat by the bearing of existing 
orders, yet it is superior to our other literary organs, 
and satisfies, in part, the hunger of our youth. It satis- 
fies me not, nor Emerson. It measures not the meri- 
dian, but the morning ray ; the nations wait for the 
gnomon that shall mark the broad noon." The dan- 
ger from Alcott and other less eccentric, but also less 
able ultra-transcendentalists, was, that they should 
cast discredit on the entire enterprise, by their ab- 
surd impracticalities. The "Orphic Sayings" of 
Alcott were, of course, the especial butt of those 
who were inclined to poke fun, and were much 
parodied. " The worst of these," says Mr. T. W. 
Higginson, " Mr. Alcott composedly pasted into his 
diary, indexing them, with his accustomed thorough- 
ness and neatness, as 'Parodies on Orphic Sayings.' "

THE DIAL 



299 



But the editors found it necessary to suppress " the 
first man Pythagoras would ask for if he came to 
Concord," and, as kindly and judiciously as possi- 
ble, " held him down." 

Theodore Parker furnished, perhaps, the oppo- 
site extreme from Alcott. His work was solid virile 
common-sense, and looked, for the most part, to the 
practical application of ideas to life. What his 
ideas were he showed later on in his " Massachu- 
setts Quarterly Review." This was to be, he said, 
" a ' Dial ' with a beard "; somebody else has said 
that it was " a beard without anything else." Nev- 
ertheless, Parker's work was more calculated to 
" take " than that of any of the others, not except- 
ing Emerson, who is reported to have said himself 
that Parker's articles " sold the numbers." It is 
rather interesting to note that the only early " Dial " 
to which Parker contributed nothing should have 
been the one to fall into the hands of Carlyle, elic- 
iting this criticism : " The ' Dial,' too, it is all spirit- 
like, aeriform, aurora-borealis-like. Will no Angel 
body himself out of that ; no stalwart Yankee man 
with color in the cheeks of him, and a coat on his 
back?" Emerson evidently saw and regretted this 
tendency of " The Dial " people to fire in the air ; 
among other things to the same effect, he said in 
his diary : "It ought to contain the best advice on 
the topics of government, temperance, abolition, 
trade, and domestic life. ... It ought to go straight 
into life with the devoted wisdom of the best men 
in the land. It should should it not? be a de- 
gree nearer to the hodiernal facts than my writings 
are. I wish to write pure mathematics, and not a 
culinary almanac or application of science to the 
arts." 

The force of this conviction, Emerson was to have 
an opportunity of testing, much against his desires. 
" The Dial " passed into his hands at the end of its 
second year. The strain of the editorship had been 
more than Miss Fuller could bear. She was at this 
time compelled to make her living ; but " The Dial " 
was not so much a bread-winner as a bread-loser. 
At the end of two years she prepared, with much 
regret, to give up the struggle, and wrote to Emer- 
son that unless he or Parker should be willing to 
become responsible for the periodical it must surely 
go to the ground. Parker was quite unable to incur 
the obligation, and as Emerson would not "will- 
ingly let it die," rather than have it fall into the 
hands of the Canaanites he concluded to try it for 
a time. During the two years that it continued 
to live, he was its banker, editor, and chief con- 
tributor. 

After " The Dial " passed into Emerson's hands, 
Thoreau contributed more and more liberally, and 
finally turned to prose, where he for the first time 
struck his best vein. Parker's devotion to the mag- 
azine had been largely a tribute to Miss Fuller ; 
to her assistance he had come with greater and 
greater vigor toward the close of her incumbency. 
The table of contents of her last number shows him 
to have written a good part of that issue. After 



she was relieved by Emerson, Parker's contribu- 
tions fell off rapidly, and Thoreau forged into his 
place. 

In spite of the loss of Parker, however, one seems 
to see a slight change toward a more substantial 
and helpful dealing with the real problems of life 
which it was the opinion of Emerson " The Dial " 
ought to undertake. In some cases, to be sure as, 
for example, in his essay on " Agriculture in Massa- 
chusetts " one is rather humorously aware of the 
conscious effort to deal with practical matters in a 
practical way. Emerson, trying to carry himself 
jauntily whilst giving advice to farmers about 
whether they shall sell their cows in the autumn or 
in the spring, is not conducive to gravity. 

Much of Emerson's best work, both prose and 
verse, was first published in " The Dial," for the 
sake of keeping the thing on its feet, when he might 
profitably have published elsewhere. Of his reviews 
and shorter criticisms, written especially for " The 
Dial," not so much can be said in the way of praise. 
Their quality is considerably below that of the pieces 
which were written for other purposes and after- 
ward found their way into the pages of the struggling 
magazine. Emerson was not at his best as a re- 
viewer. In dealing with characteristics, and the 
salient features of a great artist's spiritual message, 
he is himself great ; but in criticism of the minuter 
sort, in dealing with technique and those matters 
which appertain to art, he betrays frequently a sur- 
prising weakness. Often, too, he fails of the dis- 
tinction of manner which attends him on other 
subjects. In fact, if anything tends to weaken the 
general tone of Emerson's literary criticism, it is 
that he condescends to deal occasionally in the con- 
ventional euphuisms of the reviewer, the polite 
inanity of which Carlyle so early washed his hands. 
There is more than a touch of this in Emerson's 
mild characterization of Carlyle's " remarkable 
style." When he comes to modern literature, he 
sometimes lacks proportion, and can speak in the 
same breath of Wordsworth, Byron, Coleridge, 
Shelley, and Felicia Hemans. As a rule, how- 
ever, Emerson is superior to these weaknesses, and 
usually his humorous good sense stands by him 
manfully against the assault of whole battalions 
of the nonsense and freakishness of that senti- 
mental time. 

The fight to keep afloat such a periodical as " The 
Dial " proved more than Emerson could stand, and 
after a losing battle of two years he also gave it up. 
He left the pumps, and the water-logged craft dove 
to the bottom. The difficulties of successfully con- 
ducting such a magazine were well-nigh insuperable. 
It was a constant drain on Emerson. It never suc- 
ceeded in paying anything either to editors or con- 
tributors, and had only twelve copies for free dis- 
tribution. Frequently these gratuitous compositions 
would fail to come to hand as promised, and then 
the editors were compelled to fill in the gaps with 
their " ready pen," since the scissors were not to be

[May 1, 



the bilious eye of Carlyle was a particularly slim 
one, got out, under great strain, by Miss Fuller, who 
" wrote eighty-five of its one hundred and thirty-six 
pages." 

These difficulties, of course, account to a consid- 
erable degree for the shortcomings of " The Dial," 
its lack of unity, its frequent haziness, its repetitions 
and its lack of consecutiveness ; account, in short, 
for its want of that indispensable thing, distinct 
character as a periodical. Many magazines of infe- 
rior power have been better organized and have 
exhibited more individuality in themselves, with 
far less to draw upon in their several contributors. 
Yet on the whole it must be said, probably, that the 
failure of " The Dial " was more the fault of the 
times than of the managers or the contributors. That 
its spiritual aim was too high or too bold to enlist 
the interest of any large class of Americans of that 
time is fairly evident. Certainly " the Transcen- 
dentalists " were not a large contingent in American 
society in 1840-45. " The Dial " was undoubtedly 
" the precious life-blood," if not " of a master spirit " 
at least of a great many " remarkable " writers, and 
it quickened the veins of many others ; but it was 
rather intended to do its work by being " treasured 
up to a life beyond life " than by an immediate 
effect on the organs of society in its own time.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A PUBLISHER'S PROTEST. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In your issue of March 16 appears an article entitled 
" Author and Publisher," upon which I trust you will 
allow me to comment. I pass by the fact that it repro- 
duces in all their vague recklessness the vaguest and 
most reckless statements of Sir Walter Besant. To 
polemise against these were worse than useless. But, 
luckily or unluckily, a couple of very definite assertions 
are risked, and it is these I wish to challenge. I quote 
the ipsissima verba of the article: 

" If it is practically certain that a thousand copies of any 
book of the ordinary sort will find purchasers, there is no risk 
in its publication." 

Obviously it must be meant that it is practically certain 
that the thousand copies will find purchasers, and that 
a sale of one thousand copies is sufficient to cover ex- 
penses. 

Now, in the first place, a vast number of works are 
printed in editions of less than 1000, in editions of 750, 
500, or even 250. I enclose a catalogue of my publica- 
tions, in which I have marked with a cross books of which 
less than 1000 have been printed, in the majority of 
cases editions of 500. So far, then, from its being pos- 
sible to count upon a sale of 1000 for works of this 
class, one does not dream of doing so; on the contrary, 
one makes one's calculations upon the basis that a sale 
of 300 copies will cover prime outlay, and, let me add, 
one is frequently disappointed in one's expectation, sell- 
ing perhaps 150 or 200 only, instead of the estimated 
300. It is quite evident that for books of this kind 50 



copies more or less may make all the difference between 
profit and loss; equally evident that however carefully 
the publisher makes his calculations he cannot be sure 
of selling up to the required limit, and therefore must 
take a risk which in the case of a 2 2s. or 3 3s. book 
may easily run into a large sum. 

I know what will be answered. Such books, it will 
be asserted, are published on commission only. I can 
only say that nine out of every ten of the books I have 
marked in my catalogue with a cross, to indicate that less 
than 1000 were printed, are published solely at my risk, 
without any help or subsidy whatsoever. And I could 
cite many of an even more scholarly and abstruse nature 
than certain of my publications; e. g., Mr. Frazer's edi- 
tion of Pausanias, the cost of production of which is 
borne wholly by the publisher. Then it will be said, 
" Oh, but the statement applies to ordinary books," and 
the books you, Mr. Nutt, publish, and the class of books 
you have in view, are not ordinary books; they are books 
for the select few, for the scholar and the book-lover, 
not for the man in the street." Very well. Then I ask 
what is meant by an ordinary book ? And, so far as I 
can see, the answer must be : a book which is practically 
certain to sell to the extent of 1000 copies, and the sale 
of 1000 copies of which is certain to pay prime outlay. 
In which case, I submit, the bold assertion on which I 
comment becomes a singularly inept La Palissade. 

In the second place, just as the 1000 copy limit of 
sale is meaningless as applied to certain books because 
the calculations respecting them are made on a 300 to 
500 sale basis, so it is equally meaningless when applied 
to the still vaster class of popular (which should be 
ordinary) books which cannot bring in profit until the 
sales have reached figures of from 3000 to 20,000. In 
the case of perhaps the majority of illustrated children's 
books, and of educational works, the sale of 1000 copies 
would be insufficient to cover the illustrator's or the 
editor's fee, let alone other expenses. And books of 
this class are, to the extent of ninety per cent, publishers' 
ventures. Here again, it is, I think, obvious that if 
profit calculations have to be made on the basis of sales 
running into thousands, it is absolutely impossible to 
avoid a certain amount nay, a considerable amount 
of risk. 

So far, my criticism of the first assertion to which I 
take exception. The fact is, I venture to think, that 
the writer of the article, like Sir Walter Besant him- 
self, has in view a single class of book only : the medium- 
priced novel or hack-library book, biography, essays, or 
what not, books in which the elements of cost are almost 
exclusively paper, print, binding, and in the case of 
which the authors depend for their remuneration upon 
royalties. I should think it likely that with books of 
this class the 1000 copy limit of sale may be appli- 
cable. But in the case of works of erudition, of beau- 
tifully illustrated books, of popular educational works, 
of popular gift and children's books, that limit is wholly 
inapplicable, either because such a sale never can be 
reached, or because it must be largely exceeded. And 
my complaint against Sir Walter Besant, and against 
the writer of " Author and Publisher," is that they 
keep their eyes fixed upon the least deserving, the least 
intrinsically valuable, portion of the total output of 
books current hack-fiction to the utter neglect of 
the abiding, the vitally essential elements of literature. 
And this brings me to the second count of my indict- 
ment. 

Sir Walter Besant's emphatic declaration that " the 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

method of the future in publishing is one which treats 
the publisher as an agent working upon commission, 
who will take none but commission books, who will 
take his commission, and no more," is quoted with en- 
tire gravity and apparent approval. Yet can anything 
be more outrageously silly ? Even if the large class of 
collective publications encyclopaedias, dictionaries, and 
the like, where obviously the commission principle be 
applied be left out of account, and only individual 
work be considered, does Sir Walter Besant, does the 
writer of " Author and Publisher," really think that the 
average man of science, college professor, local histo- 
rian, jurist, theologian, or medical man, is willing or is 
able to bear the cost of bringing the result of his labors 
before the world ? Mr. Spencer's example is quoted, 
in ignorance, I would fain believe, of the true import of 
his testimony. For Mr. Spencer has put it on record 
(I quote his own words) : " The losses I suffered my- 
self were great, and continued for many years." How 
many scholars would be able, how many willing, to face 
" great and continued loss for many years " ? And 
what a comment upon the glib statement that there is 
no risk in publishing! One of the foremost philosophers 
of the century has to wait for years, has to risk great 
loss, before he derives profit from his books. Supposing 
he had died with his task but half achieved (and pre- 
mature death has caused many a publishing venture to 
fail), it is safe to say that the losses Mr. Spencer speaks 
of never would have been converted into a balance on 
the right side. The average scholar cannot count' upon 
combining in himself genius, long life, and a hand- 
some private income. 

I can only speak with certainty of my own publica- 
tions, but I can most certainly affirm that if I had waited 
to be " commissioned " I should never have published 
the " Tudor Translations," or Sommer's edition of the 
"Morte Darthur," or the "Grimm Library," or the 
" Tudor Library," or " Painter's Palace of Pleasure," or 
the " Bibliotheque de Carabas," or, in fact, ninety-nine 
out of every one hundred books I have published. I 
am always looking for the intelligent author who will 
publish on commission. But in the very nature of 
things the majority of authors are not and cannot be 
capitalists, and publishing more than any other manu- 
facturing business requires capital. Sir Walter Besant's 
" method of the future " would prevent the publication 
of nearly every book that is worth publishing at all. 

ALFRED NUTT. 

London, April 14, 1899. 



[Mr. Nutt forestalls our rejoinder to his main 
contention. When we spoke of " any book of the 
ordinary sort " it was with the express purpose of 
excluding the classes of books which we quite agree 
with him in thinking would require a larger sale 
than 1000 copies to prove profitable ventures. Nor 
had we the remotest intention of implying that 
works of the special and scholarly class illustrated 
by Mr. Nutt's own catalogue were likely to sell to 
the extent of 1000 copies. As for his grievance 
that we quote Sir Walter Besant " with entire grav- 
ity and apparent approval," we can only say that 
the approval is not so " apparent " as he thinks, but 
that Sir Walter's opinions are entitled to at least as 
respectful a consideration as are those of his pub- 
lisher-critics. EDK. THE DIAL!. 



ADMIRAL SAMPSON AT SANTIAGO. - 

A CORRECTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a notice of my book " With Sampson through the 
War," in your last issue, the reviewer says : " He sup- 
presses, for example, all mention of the dispatch from 
Sampson ordering Schley to hold his fleet off Santiago." 

On page 306 of the book the dispatch referred to as 
suppressed will be found mentioned and commented 
upon to the extent of half a page. 

Your reviewer adds: "This is more unpardonable, 
because Admiral Sampson has evidently supplied the 
writer with most of his material, including a chapter of 
his own." 

Admiral Sampson supplied me with none of the ma- 
terial except that which is directly credited to him 
i. e., his chapter, and a few short interviews. My mate- 
rial was obtained from personal observation and from 
the report of the Bureau of Navigation, where you will 
find in full all the official matter referred to in my book. 

As your reviewer's statements reflect upon the hon- 
esty of purpose of Admiral Sampson and myself, I trust 
you will do me the favor to publish this letter.

WHAT THE JAPANESE READ. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The tastes of the Japanese in reading are illustrated 
in a table accompanying a recent official report from the 
Imperial Library at Tokyo, of which I send you a sum- 
mary. During a period of twenty-four days covered 
by the report, the readers numbered 7,770, and the 
books called for were classified as follows: 

Japanese and European 
Chinese works. works. 

Theology and religion 635 14 

Philosophy and education 2,368 145 

Literature and languages 8,038 998 

History, biography, geography, travel . . 9,768 460 

Law, politics, sociology, economy, statistics 6,577 304 

Mathematics, natural philosophy, medicine 9,506 388 

Engineering, military arts, industries . . 4,943 205 

Miscellaneous books 4,840 530 

The table will interest American readers as showing 
how large is the number of European works included. 
It may be added that the Japanese are decidedly a 
reading people. Even the " jinrikisha man," waiting on 
the street-corner for a customer, is generally to be seen 
reading a newspaper, magazine, or book. And in Japan 
also, " of making many books there is no end."

AIRS OF SPRING. 

Among the willow tassels buzz the bees; 

Just sun enough to warm the butterfly, 
Dropt like the bright leaf fallen from autumn trees, 

To stir the light-heart squirrel scampering by; 

A numb snake coiled upon a sunny mound; 

Green of young mosses on the shadow's bed; 
Faint odors trustful incense from the ground, 

In misty lift where sleep the winter's dead; 

Anemones here, arbutus, violets there; 

The wind is busy with the maple flowers; 
Shy blisses glimmer up and down the air 

Where once again they hover love's own hours.

GREAT GENERALS nsr BLUE AND GRAY.* 

Thomas Jonathan Jackson occupies a pecu- 
liar place among the heroes of American his- 
tory. As the story of the great Civil War is 
being told, in these days when the passions of 
a generation ago are forgotten and the intensely 
partisan volumes of contemporary writers are 
revised with a cooler judgment, the worth of 
this great soldier of the Lost Cause becomes 
increasingly apparent. No one can estimate 
what a power for good in healing the wounds 
of a fratricidal strife one thought has been : If 
an intensely earnest, devoted Christian man 
like u Stonewall " Jackson believed in the jus- 
ness of the contention of the South and was 
willing to give his life for his convictions, then 
no one from the other side has the right to 
make sweeping condemnation of " rebels " and 
" traitors " without a fair and unbiased exam- 
ination of the questions at issue in the great 
contest which nearly severed the bonds of 
American union. 

Some such thought as this must explain the 
welcome given to the two noble volumes by 
Colonel Henderson, in which, with grace of lit- 
erary style and wealth of graphic aid, he has 
attempted the interpretation of the life of a 
great commander. Himself learned in military 
lore, no better one could have been chosen to 
paint the portrait of a general who took with 
him into the field the invaluable treasures of a 
well-ordered mind enriched by years of study 
of the achievements of the world's leading sol- 
diers. In the twelve hundred pages, besides 
the thread of the life-story of Jackson, the 
reader will find many a paragraph that will 
stimulate careful thought, many a bright phrase 
that will illumine the darkness of conflict, many 
a brilliant description that will charm. There 
can be no doubt that this work will be the 
standard biography of Jackson, and that, there- 
fore, the literature of the Civil War has received 
a notable addition. 

The personality of the hero is everywhere, 
and naturally so. It is probable that no one

could tell the details of the career of this sol- 
dier of the South without feeling his heart warm 
with enthusiasm toward one who was intensely 
popular, although his life throughout was char- 
acterized by rigid reserve, whose student's na- 
ture gave him self-control, who manifested tact 
in many a critical moment because of this self- 
possession, who cared little for the praise of his 
fellow men, and who seemed to enjoy surround- 
ing himself and his plans with a veil of deep 
mystery. In boyhood and youth, in the train- 
ing days of the Mexican War, and in the cam- 
paigns of the Valley, wherever Jackson appeared 
he was a power. His brain worked for others ; 
he did the thinking and oftentimes the doing 
as well. Perhaps the facts sustain such a notion, 
but there is such a fascination in the narrative 
that one who seeks to criticise is led to wonder 
whether this uniformity of laudation may not 
be a defect of judgment, the presence of which 
should lead to a closer examination of state- 
ments about other men and things which are 
interwoven into the story. 

It is probable, also, that no one could tell 
the details of the career of Jackson without 
being in sympathy with the cause for which he 
fought and died. When one is gone, the tes- 
timony of a friend is more to be desired than 
the tribute of an enemy. A Northerner, in 
these days of reconciliation and reunion, might 
write appreciatively of a Southern general, 
might give him due credit for honesty of pur- 
pose, for skill in strategy, for valor in conflict ; 
and yet there would be the certain bias of one 
who was reared under different conditions and 
with opposing fundamental notions. In like 
manner, if in any part of this work there is ap- 
pearance of too great praise for the Southern 
leaders and too much sympathy for the Confed- 
eracy, the unpleasant thought will come that this 
intensity of feeling may prevent that impartial 
examination of facts which an alien might be 
expected to make when studying military move- 
ments in the light of sober history, with a defi- 
nite view of contributing to the literature of 
warfare rather than to that of partisanship. 

It is more than likely that a writer who had 
had soldierly training and military sympathies 
would far better express the true estimate of 
the life of a great general than any civilian 
possibly could do. At the same time, in case 
of conflict between the military authorities and 
the civil, the bias of personal opinion and tech- 
nical training would certainly operate in cloud- 
ing the judgment to some degree. In every 
war there are times when the desires of the

civil authority go counter to the views of the 
military. Sometimes time shows that the civil 
arm was to blame ; sometimes the reverse is 
true. In Jackson's career, as in that of many 
a general of the Civil War, there were occa- 
sions when the feeling between these two forms 
of authority was intense. No one needs to read 
far in Colonel Henderson's volumes in order to 
find the strength of his opinion that the civil 
authorities are too apt to interfere with generals 
in the field, and that things would go much 
better were the military authorities to be given 
entire control. There are many who would 
contend that history does not sustain the cor- 
rectness of such a view. 

Having now a writer who has become thor- 
oughly imbued with the idea of the nobility of 
character of his subject, who either had a pre- 
viously formed conception of the justice of that 
hero's cause or reached such a conclusion after 
a sympathetic study, and who has the military 
bent of mind, the inevitable tendency will be 
that the heroic element will be made too prom- 
inent, and that every obstacle will give way 
before the mighty genius which Providence has 
determined shall triumph. No matter how over- 
whelming the odds, victory will be sure to come ; 
or, if it fails, will be prevented only because of 
the want of hearty cooperation on the part of 
someone else. 

These seem to be the lines of criticism along 
which the volumes devoted to Stonewall Jack- 
son may be, perhaps harshly, reviewed. But 
there is a sense in which these criticisms only 
increase the praise due the author. One feels 
that the history of a life is presented from the 
standpoint of that life. The reader here sees 
things as Stonewall Jackson saw them. He 
understands how the problem of slavery ap- 
peared to a thoughtful man of the South. In 
the words of Mrs. Jackson : 

" He found the institution a responsible and trouble- 
some one, and I have heard him say that he would 
prefer to see the negroes free, but he believed that 
slavery was sanctioned by the Creator himself, who 
maketh men to differ, and instituted laws for the bond 
and free. He therefore accepted slavery as it existed 
in the South, not as a thing desirable in itself, but as 
allowed by Providence for ends which it was not his 
business to determine." 

The reader understands how it came about 
that men believed that injustice was done them 
in the Union, and were willing to fight and die, 
if necessary, to sustain their convictions when 
once deliberately formed. The point of view 
can be appreciated, even if the arguments given 
do not seem decisive. The chapter on the 



causes of the war does not give attention to 
many topics which were influential in bring- 
ing about the struggle. Statements are made 
which are to be taken with much allowance. 
There is apparent inconsistency in places, 
as, for example, where the old fear of slave 
insurrection is used to warrant rebellion after 
the election of Abraham Lincoln ; while, ten 
pages later, the safety of the women and chil- 
dren in the midst of war's alarms, when only 
the slaves were near, is used to show the false- 
ness of any such ideas of the wrong treatment 
of slaves as were set forth in "Uncle Tom's 
Cabin." 

A reasonable argument for the justification 
of the South in rebellion is sought in many 
pages, and then much of truth is hinted at inci- 
dentally in a single paragraph : 

" It is impossible to determine how far the profes- 
sional politician was responsible for the Civil War. But 
when we recall the fact that secession followed close on 
the overthrow of a faction which had long monopolized 
the spoils of office, and that this faction found compen- 
sation in the establishment of a new government, it is 
not easy to resist the suspicion that the secession move- 
ment was neither more nor less than a conspiracy hatched 
by a clever and unscrupulous cabal." 

The volumes under consideration are remark- 
ably strong in two respects. They set forth a 
striking picture of Jackson as a man, and they 
show the value of strategy in warfare. Because 
Jackson was so successful as a strategist, he 
probably appealed to the author as one of the 
best of characters around whom might be woven 
the arguments for the most careful study of 
military science. 

The man appears everywhere. " He never 
smoked, he was a strict teetotaller, and he never 
touched a card." He was " as exact as the 
multiplication table, and as full of things mil- 
itary as an arsenal." " Few detected beneath 
that quiet demeanor and absent manner, the 
existence of energy incarnate and an iron will." 
" As the playful tenderness he displayed at 
home was never suspected, so the consuming 
earnestness, the absolute fearlessness, whether 
of danger or responsibility, the utter disregard 
of man, and the unquestioning faith in the 
Almighty, which made up the individuality 
which men called Stonewall Jackson, remained 
hidden from all but one" (his wife). Such 
brief extracts show glimpses of the man as he 
appeared to his fellows. 

As to his skill in strategy, there is need for 
little comment. He was an ardent admirer of 
Napoleon Bonaparte. He studied his cam- 
paigns with eagerness. He noted particularly 



304 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



the " swiftness, daring, and energy of his move- 
ments." One paragraph will suffice : 

" With God's blessing (this was a favorite phrase 
with him) let us make thorough work of it.' When once 
he had joined battle, no loss, no suffering was permitted 
to stay his hand. He never dreamed of retreat until he 
had put in his last reserve. Yet his victories were won 
rather by sweat than blood, by skilful manoeuvring 
rather than sheer hard fighting. ' I had rather lose one 
man in marching than five in battle,' and in order to 
achieve an easy triumph his men were marched till they 
dropped in scores. But the marches which strewed the 
wayside with the footsore and the weaklings won his 
battles. The enemy, surprised and outnumbered, was 
practically beaten before a shot was fired, and success 
was attained at a trifling cost." 

The story of George Gordon Meade suffers 
by comparison with the splendid narrative by 
Colonel Henderson, and yet there are many 
points of similarity. The early experiences of 
the two future generals of the Rebellion were 
much the same. Each followed his prelimin- 
ary training at West Point with service in the 
Mexican War, and this similarity of experience 
has naturally produced a similarity of treatment 
on the part of the two widely separated writers. 
Each has decided views regarding the superior 
worth of strategy in warfare, and each reaches 
the conclusion stated in the words of Colonel 
Henderson : " Providence is more inclined to 
side with the big brains than with the big bat- 
talions." 

It is exceedingly interesting to compare the 
views of the two authors as set forth in the 
Jackson life under the chapter heading " Se- 
cession " and in the Meade story under " The 
Cause of the Civil War " and in a second chap- 
ter entitled " Truths and Popular Errors Re- 
garding the Civil War." The parallelism might 
be further illustrated by a reference to the 
numerous maps and plans furnished by each 
work, the Meade biography being illustrated 
by twenty-two diagrams, some of them, how- 
ever, lacking the clearness of delineation de- 
sired by the student ; and the Jackson volumes 
by over thirty similar graphic helps. 

In style, however, Mr. Bache lacks the clear- 
ness of his contemporary. The sentences are 
often involved and the phrases stilted. It is 
somewhat difficult to read passage after passage, 
where the thought is expressed in the style of 
this selected sentence : 

" The absurdities which the contemplation of a mul- 
titude of sovereign states, without marked geographical 
boundaries, which have lived for nearly a century to- 
gether the common life of a nation, coupled with the 
right of secession at any time, exhibit to us, are infinite." 

This life of Meade, being the first one in a 



generation since the war, might have been made 
a model, truth and error being separated in the 
cold light of dispassionate recital. Laudation 
of an uncle by a nephew might be expected, 
but a few sentences will indicate the spirit 
which seems to mark the volume. 

It was Sheridan's " habitual practice never 
to blench from claiming more than the merit 
in whatever he was concerned" (page 36). 
McClellan was 

" A man without the poise that is capable of directing 
to great deeds. . . . Put to the actual test of war, and 
suspicions of his shortcomings for his task beginning to 
invade the sober common-sense of the people, not to be 
in the long run deceived as to what concerns them nearly, 
some abatement of this arrogance became perceptible, 
although he still had so false a view of his relations as 
a military man to the civil power that he could reconcile 
himself to writing to the President a letter unprece- 
dented in its assumption of ability to counsel in a 
sphere the threshold of which he should not have 
touched " (page 173). 

Halleck, too, receives such compliments as 
the following : 

" Halleck . . . made progress so slow towards Cor- 
inth, in Mississippi, moving fifteen miles in six weeks, 
that the enemy availed himself of the ample time placed 
at his disposal to evacuate the place with all his mate- 
rial, and leave only the husks of victory behind. Yet 
Halleck was the general who, from Washington, subse- 
quently told McClellan that his men did not march 
enough for exercise. . . . His generalship, however, had 
not, as we have seen, prevented Halleck from being 
called to Washington as general-in-chief of the armies 
of the United States " (page 249). 

Perhaps it is unnecessary to give further 
illustrations. One general after another is 
treated in such frank manner. One after an- 
other is given trial only to fail. Finally from 
the mists of defeat and demoralization and de- 
spair the true hero (Meade) emerges, and from 
that auspicious moment mistakes are few and 
difficulties are trifles. 

Getting such an impression of the tone of 
mind of the author, the result of examination is 
disappointing. " The alternative which has 
been discarded always seems to have extraordin- 
ary fascination for the average human mind, so 
easy is it to demonstrate success of the thing not 
tried." Such is the text which serves to illus- 
trate the truth that Meade was right and that 
all his critics were wrong, and if that statement 
be not accepted as convincing, then let every 
critic beware, or each will be treated with such 
stinging comment as is given one or two mild 
opponents of General Meade's policy. 

Returning once again, for a moment, to a 
comparison of the two works reviewed, the 
reader feels that Colonel Henderson is partial

to his hero, but this partiality is evidently the 
result of such deep study of the man and his 
time, that it becomes part of the nature of the 
writer, who sends his message from the heart. 
In the case of Mr. Bache, the conviction is 
strong that the desire to have the last word 
with a generation of writers about the war, and 
the over-anxiety to have a great general prop- 
erly appreciated by posterity, have clouded the 
judgment to such an extent that, in contro- 
verted questions, the Life of General Meade 
can scarcely be taken as a safe guide to the 
anxious seeker after the truth.

OLD-AGE LETTERS or SAVAGE IIANDOR.* 

Any work bearing the name of Landor would 
be certain to arouse the expectation of the lit- 
erary public. There are several reasons for 
this. In the world of letters Landor was a 
unique figure. " I am and will be alone as long 
as I live, and after," he wrote Brougham ; and 
the judgment thus pronounced upon himself 
has been accepted as final. He was, indeed, a 
sort of paradox. To some, to most perhaps, 
his manner was rough and crabbed, while to 
others it seemed imbued with all the affable 
grace of old-world gallantry ; the air of defi- 
ance with which he hedged himself in prevented 
many from seeing that he possessed a delicacy 
of sentiment almost unparalleled in others ; his 
childish crochets, his whims, his caprices, were 
but the cloaks to a larger and nobler nature ; 
and his slavery to impulse was at least extenu- 
ated by his kingly contempt for all that was 
mean and vile and base. To this man have been 
applied more epithets, good and bad, than to any 
English writer of this century, perhaps of any 
century. Carlyle, who had the ability that 
genius always has of describing a person or a 
thing in the word or the phrase which is a dis- 
covery, summed them all up in his " unsubdu- 
able old Roman ! " Always at war with the 
world, ready to marshall his armies at a mo- 
ment's notice, though sometimes borne back by 
force of numbers and never victorious, he yet 
never acknowledged defeat. He lived and died 
fighting. At times it pleases me to think that, 
as Coleridge detected in himself " a smack of 
Hamlet," so we may detect in Landor a smack 
of the mad Lear. " The mind of Lear," Haz-

PUBLIC. Edited by Stephen Wheeler. Illustrated. Phil- 
adelphia : J. 8. Lippincott Go. 



litt once said, and what I quote may be ap- 
plied with almost equal force to the mind of 
Landor, " is like a tall ship driven about by 
the winds, buffeted by the furious waves, but 
that still rides above the storm, having its 
anchor fixed in the bottom of the sea ; or it is 
like the sharp rock circled by the eddying whirl- 
pool that foams and beats against it, or like the 
solid promontory pushed from its basis by the 
force of an earthquake." And Landor, like 
Lear, we remember, was the wizard who dis- 
turbed the elements. 

The letters of such a man as this, it would 
seem, ought to be particularly interesting, be- 
cause in them we should naturally look for 
some expression of this singular personality. 
But when we open the book before us, the 
" Letters of Walter Savage Landor," we meet 
at the very start with a slight disappointment. 
The title promises rather too much, for the 
book actually contains only a small part of 
Landor's correspondence. We have here the 
letters written by him to Lady Graves-Sawle, 
before and after her marriage, and to her 
mother, during the years 1838 to 1863. In 
addition to these letters, which, with the ex- 
ception, so far as I can find, of only three short 
extracts printed in Foster's biography of Lan- 
dor, have hitherto been unpublished, are 
reprinted the public letters which Landor ad- 
dressed to " The Examiner " during the years 
1838 to 1855. These public letters may be 
dismissed with a word. Their tone and point 
of view are pretty well suggested in the follow- 
ing passage : 

" In my views on politics I have given offense to many 
good and sensible men. Perhaps I may be erroneous 
in some of my opinions, but is it quite certain that they 
themselves are exempt from fallibility in all of theirs ? 
Permit me to ask whether they have given proofs to 
the world of more research, more intellect, more infor- 
mation, more independence ? I come forward, not to 
offend, but to conduct; not to quarrel, but to teach; and 
I would rather make one man wiser than ten thousand 
friendly to me; yet I profess no indifference to the fav- 
ourable opinion of those writers who influence the public 
judgment. I suspect both of moroseness and of false- 
hood such as are guilty of this arrogant and contemptu- 
ous demeanor. It is only small dogs that run after the 
stones cast at them; and these small dogs, importunate 
to be petted and prompt at tricks, are of a breed not 
remarkable for sagacity or fidelity. 

" Dependent on no party, influenced by none, abstain- 
ing from the society and conversation of the few public 
men I happen to be acquainted with, for no other reason 
than because they are in power and office, I shall con- 
tinue, so long as I live, to notice the politics and politi- 
cians which may promote or impede the public welfare." 
Not all of these public letters were worth pre- 
serving, nor are they likely to entertain the 



306

general reader. Some of them, nevertheless, 
are manly appeals for justice, and their chief 
merit, I take it, is to show that Landor was at 
all times the friend of the oppressed and the 
enemy of the oppressor. 

It is the private letters that constitute the 
more valuable portion of the book. As might 
be supposed, these contain some interesting 
impressions of men and things. A few of 
these impressions are really good, as this one 
of Byron, for instance : " In Byron there is 
much to admire but nothing to imitate : for 
energy is beyond the limits of imitation." But 
more, by far, are of the " slap-dash " sort as 
Lowell once characterized them, which are 
interesting only because they bear the stamp of 
Landor's originality. Of this kind are Lan- 
dor's statements that Aubrey de Vere's " En- 
glish Misrule and Irish Misdeeds "is "a work 
which unites the wisdom of Bacon with the elo- 
quence of Burke," that " The world has seen 
only one man in two thousand years so eloquent 
as Kossuth," that Mrs. Somerville was " the 
most wonderful woman the world ever saw," 
and so on. 

The letters themselves are not as quotable 
as one familiar with Landor's works would ex- 
pect. Of the following extracts, which will 
serve as well as any, perhaps, to illustrate the 
author's manner in this form of invention, the 
last, if I mistake not, are in a strain somewhat 
unusual with Landor. 

" It is a horrible thing to have many literary friends. 
They are apt to fancy that, however your time may be 
occupied, you must at all events have enough to read 
what they send you. Alas ! alas ! There are few who 
have time enough to read even all the very good books 
that have been written, old and new ; and who can neglect 
the good for the bad without compunction and remorse ? 
... In regard to small authors, restless for celebrity, 
and wriggling on their level walks like worms exposed 
to the sunshine, I have scarcely ever seen one of these 
poor creatures who did not at one time excite my smiles, 
and at another my pity. . . . When years have stored 
your mind with observation, you will continue to prefer 
Goldsmith to Bulwer, Miss Edgeworth to Lady Morgan, 
Madame de Se'vigne' to Chateaubriand: in other words, 
the very best to the very worst." 

" There are few of us who do not know how a little 
grief swells a greater. Have you never seen two drops 
of rain upon a window, where the larger has been qui- 
escent until the lesser was drawn into it then it 
dropped." 

" Do not let the fishermen catch all the trout, for 
they are pretty creatures, and I am delighted to see 
them playing on the surface of the water. The very 
oldest of them may sometimes be detected in this idle 
occupation so there is a sort of sympathy between us." 

" You did right in not killing the grouse. Let men 
do these things if they will. Perhaps there is no harm 
in it perhaps it makes them no crueller than they 



would be otherwise. But it is hard to take away what 
we cannot give and life is a pleasant thing at least 
to birds. No doubt the young ones say tender things 
to one another, and even the old ones do not dream of 
death." 

" I have been to visit your flowers they are doing 
well, and the roses I planted seemed glad to see me." 

Thoughts like the last hint at the precise value 
of this collection of letters. To begin with, 
there is no treasure-trove of thought here. Two- 
thirds of the letters were written to a young 
and inexperienced girl wholly incapable of draw- 
ing from Landor his best ideas. The author, 
however, has thrown about this light gossip of 
his old age a charm that certainly delights the 
reader. Landor evidently had no thought of 
the public in mind when he wrote these letters, 
although, now that they are published, they may 
in a measure satisfy the curiosity the public 
always has to get a peep at the interior of the 
green-room. They add nothing to our knowl- 
edge of Landor, although they do emphasize 
the fact that under favorable circumstances he 
could be agreeable even amiable. In other 
words, the old Roman has for once put off his 
armor and donned the toga of a peaceful citizen 
of Rome, although, it must be owned, we 
never quite rid ourselves of an uneasy feeling 
that after all he may have his weapons within 
easy reach, ready to be seized at a moment's 
notice. TULEY FRANCIS HUNTINGTON. 



TWO EPOCHS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.* 



The great name of Gregorovius (1821 
1891 ) is chiefly associated with mediaeval 
Rome. This was the subject of his first his- 
torical study, and, as recast in 1883, the work 
displays all his mastery of form and abundance 
of accurate scholarship. The story of the em- 
peror who settled the boundaries and the for- 
eign policy of the Roman Empire, who made 
the last and greatest effort to revive the full 
splendor of Hellenic paganism, is well deserv- 
ing of such a monograph. For the man of gen- 
eral culture, the sixty-sixth chapter of Meri- 
vale's standard work may suffice. But every 
serious student of Roman history will find Gre- 
gorovius' book a necessity. 

Our American specialists in any such field 
are, however, as I believe, almost invariably

accustomed to the use of German books. The 
present translation must have been intended 
almost solely for insular students ; it is not 
intended, however, for the mere general reader. 
The French, Latin, and Greek, which occurs 
abundantly in the foot-notes, is never translated : 
German is left standing only in the titles of 
other works cited. 

Now, that a generation of students equipped 
in just this peculiar fashion really exists in 
England, there is abundant reason to believe. 
In spite of all ties, of old kin and recent roy- 
alty, our cousins still turn their backs on the 
parent Teutonic speech, in which half the vol- 
umes of constant reference in almost every 
American scholar's working library are writ- 
ten. German is a sealed book to many per- 
haps to most Oxford or Cambridge gradu- 
ates to-day. 

But if such a condition is to be endured and 
accepted, it must at least be faced consistently. 
Especially, such a work as this must be duly 
adapted to the reader we should in courtesy 
say the student who knows no German, and 
will not learn it. 

A mere translation of Gregorovius' text, and 
of the German portion of his foot-notes, does 
not fully accomplish this end. Three-fourths 
of the references in the notes are still to books 
cited by their German titles. In many cases, 
English translations exist ; in others, references 
were possible to English or French books. The 
only supplementary material in the English 
edition appears to be the all-too-brief and 
luminous " Introduction," of four pages, by 
Professor Henry Pelham. The swift sketch 
therein given of Hadrian's larger imperial 
policy supplies a real defect in Gregorovius' 
own work. But nearly every page needed the 
aid of the same masterly hand, in the English 
reader's interest. 

Thus, to Merivale, from whose closing vol- 
ume nearly everyone will turn to this mono- 
graph, there is apparently no reference at all. 
That such a vade mecum as Teuffel's " History 
of Latin Literature " is available in English, as 
as well as in German, has apparently not been 
revealed to the conscientious translator. In- 
deed, I find no serious attempt to supplement 
the bibliographical material for the fifteen years 
since Gregorovius' own work appeared. To 
take a most glaring instance, in the special 
"Bibliography" (pp. 382-402), Theodor 
Mommsen is credited with three German and 
two Latin monographs ; there is no mention of 
the existence, in German or English, of his 



great work on the " Provinces under the Em- 
pire " ! 

We must say, on the whole, then, that almost 
any student in America who needs Gregoro- 
vius' book at all will prefer the original, espe- 
cially if, as is probable, an edition has appeared, 
or shall soon appear, with revised bibliography. 

Though unable to compare this version with 
the original text, I have the impression that 
the translator has done her work faithfully. 
The printing has also been careful, and the 
outward appearance of the book is most luxu- 
rious. In general, the task undertaken seems 
to have been well performed. But the truth 
is, the mere " oversetting " of a valuable and 
scholarly monograph into another language is 
in itself unscholarly and unsatisfactory. The 
competent specialist, who should alone attempt 
to introduce an alien book to his own people, 
will inevitably find himself adapting it to the 
known needs of the new audience. This has 
not been attempted at all in the present instance. 

It is a pleasure to speak in a much heartier 
tone of Professor Dill's book. The outward 
form, and in some degree the subject, set it 
beside the "Hadrian," at least upon the re- 
viewer's desk. Our only quarrel, if any, is 
with its title. We hold with Professor Bury, 
that there never was a Western empire, at any 
rate until the coronation of Charles the Great. 
From the time of Constantine, the seat of em- 
pire was on the Bosporus ; while Rome or Milan 
or Ravenna was, even in Diocletian's day, but 
an outpost, or at best a provincial capital. Pro- 
fessor Dill undertakes to show how much clas- 
sical culture yet survived in Italy, and in 
Western Europe generally, through that terri- 
ble century from the first incoming of the Visi- 
goths to the disappearance of the poor puppet 
overburdened with the mighty cognomen Rom- 
ulus Augustulus. The very name of " Roman 
Society," in a local sense, seems to me all but 
effaced by Alaric's harrying (410 A. D.). 

But the task essayed is accomplished with 
diligence and learning, with grace, even with 
semi-poetic imagination, kept duly reined in by 
sober conscientiousness. The materials, indeed, 
are upon the whole scanty and unsatisfying. 
The courtly orator Symmachus, Ausonius, and 
Sidonius Apollinaris, poets whose very names 
are but half-remembered, such are the cen- 
tral figures ; for the mightier champions of early 
Christianity arise to destroy, not to uphold, the 
dying civilization. So much the defter is the 
artist's hand. 

What do the degenerate heirs of a perishing 



308

empire think about, before they go over the 
cataract ? Doubtless they meditate as little as 
possible ; least of all about their own unworthi- 
ness, as contrasted with their ancestors. Of 
what are the folk of Madrid thinking to-day ? 
As little as may be of Santiago and Manila ; 
never, if they can help it, of Ferdinand and 
Charles and Philip. Their talk is of the mor- 
row's bullfight. The cultivated classes of Can- 
ton and Pekin are doing little hard thinking. 
So, doubtless, it was in Rome, at least until 
Alaric actually thundered at the gate. 

A more interesting but unanswerable query 
to end half-querulously as we began would 
be : What did the wisest and most far-sighted 
of the Goths, the Franks, or the Lombards 
think, when first they began to realize that the 
star of Rome was setting forever, that the future 
mastery of the world was theirs ? How much 
of childish savagery was there really in their 
thoughts? Did they pour into the lands of 
older culture and milder climate as mere ma- 
rauders, or seeking a real home ? How early, 
how swiftly, how easily, did the blending of 
North and South begin ? 

We shall never know. But as we see the 
complete merging of the two at last, we almost 
question if the new voice is so certain to be 
right in assuring us, even, that 

"East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall 
meet." 

Strong races meet, and clash, and finally 
blend. Amid political and economic changes, 
the world over, more momentous than have oc- 
curred for many centuries, there is to-day a 
certain timeliness, a peculiar interest, in Pro- 
fessor Dill's scholarly and imaginative sketch.

THE WHITE MAN'S PROBLEM.* 

It is not absolutely necessary that a new book 
shall deal with the Philippines, or Cuba, or the 
Hawaiian Islands, in order to be of interest 
from the point of view from which most En- 
glish readers are studying the relations of

very likely to be Americans. Hence, at the 
present time a study by an American of what 
has been doing in South Africa in the past few 
years may well be characterized as timely, not 
in the same sense as was Professor Worcester's 
book on the Philippines, but in the larger 
sense that it comes when every source of infor- 
mation and light, even incidental, is likely to 
be welcomed and utilized. 

In more respects than one, the opening to 
settlement of Mashonaland and Matabeleland 
was analogous to undertakings in which the 
United States is now, more or less against its 
will, engaged. There was, in the one case, a race 
determinedly hostile to be dealt with ; in the 
other, a race avowedly friendly, which after a 
while revolted against the new ways of the white 
man and especially the white man's habit of 
regular labor, and in its revolt inflicted greater 
sufferings upon the whites than did the other. 
The ultimate result was the same in the two 
cases. It was not primarily the driving out of 
a resident people by an army of invaders ; there 
was in the territory ample space for all its occu- 
pants, black and white, and for a hundredfold 
more. But the new comers believed in labor, 
and had the effrontery to ask their black neigh- 
bors to break through their traditions and labor 
also ; that it was for hire did not matter, un- 
less, indeed, it made matters worse. Then there 
was revolt and bloodshed, and finally a rees- 
tablishing of the social order upon a new basis, 
the power being now definitely in the hands 
of the white man, that he might secure him- 
self against further revolt and at the same time 
compel the black to accept certain things that 
should ultimately make for his salvation. If 
the book makes one thing clear more than an- 
other, it is that no permanent improvement 
can be made in a benighted race that is not 
based upon power, upon the actual use of the 
strong hand as it is needed ; that there is no 
such thing as moral suasion in dealing with a 
savage, except in so far as the savage suspects 
that there is power behind it. 

But the author of this book discusses this 
and other political problems only by implica- 
tion. His object is to give a straightforward 
narrative of his own personal experiences as a 
member of the band of pioneers who pushed 
through the wilderness to Mashonaland, founded 
the town of Salisbury, and eventually, as part 
of a larger force, subdued the uprising inspired 
by Lo Bengula and put an end to the power 
of the Matabele king. As a young man recently

author found his way to South Africa as col- 
lector for the Smithsonian Institution ; and 
happened there in exciting times, which speed- 
ily made the young scientist a soldier and 
a gold-seeker, and finally a prosperous land- 
owner. Through what perils he made his way 
may best be read in the pages of his book, 
though the story is told so modestly that one 
needs to read many a passage a second time to 
realize what it means. Most marked in book 
as in author is its plain, unassuming style, its 
manner even and direct. Of especial interest, 
and perhaps best written, are the chapters 
treating of family and village life among the 
natives. That the author, by virtue of his ex- 
ploits as a provider of skins for the Smithso- 
nian, and consequently of much meat for the 
natives, had won their entire confidence, is fully 
evidenced by the freedom with which they im- 
parted to him their few traditions as of the 
sun setting in the headwaters of a great river 
and calmly floating eastward until morning ; 
and by the certainty with which a young woman 
who disliked her affianced purchaser appealed 
to him to provide her a way of escape by 
marrying her himself. 

If there had been any intention of making 
the book in any sense political in character, 
much might have been made of the doings of 
Mr. Cecil Rhodes and his dealings with the 
important questions affecting the new colony. 
But as with regard to other matters political, 
these doings and dealings are left to speak for 
themselves. One may easily draw inferences 
with regard to the author's opinion of Mr. 
Rhodes, and it is very evident that Mr. Brown 
is not a hero-worshipper if Mr. Rhodes is to be 
the hero ; while on the other hand, if it seems 
that Mr. Rhodes has taken especial care of the 
interests of Mr. Rhodes and of his Company as 
distinguished from the interests of the general 
Rhodesian public, he has nevertheless dealt 
with very hard questions in an eminently wise 
way, wiser than it may seem to an observer at 
a distance. And without Mr. Rhodes, there 
could, of course, have been no Rhodesia. 

The world has grown so small, and is becom- 
ing so well known in all its parts, that we may 
hardly hope to see many more added to the 
number of interesting books devoted solely to 
narrative of personal travel and adventure in 
strange lands. But " On the South African 
Frontier " is certainly one that has a message of 
interest to the general reader and that will well 
repay a few hours of study.

RECENT FOREIGN FICTION.* 

A considerable number of the romantic fictions 
of Mr. Maurus Jokai have found their way into a 
sort of English during the past ten years, but they 
have generally been open to the suspicion, if the 
fact were not avowed, of translation through the 
German, and we have never felt that they brought 
us into close contact with the thought of the writer. 
They seem, moreover, to have been chosen from the 
great mass of available material in a rather hap- 
hazard way, and we have not found it easy to find 
in them any adequate justification of the author's 
immense reputation in his own country. The firm of 
publishers who have now become the authorized rep- 
resentatives of the Hungarian novelist in this coun- 
try have undertaken to reproduce some of his novels 
more faithfully than others have done, and in direct 
translations by competent hands. Few readers un- 
derstand the importance of direct translation in such 
a case, or the great difficulty of transferring ideas 
from an agglutinative to an inflected vehicle of ex- 
pression. We will frankly say that the4wo romances 
now before us have impressed us more than any of 
their predecessors in English garb as saying just 
what their author must have meant to say in his 
own speech, and as confirming his title to rank among 
the foremost romanticists of the century. They are 
fantastic in their conception and careless in their 
attention to matters of detail, for these are doubt- 
less essential features of the writer's genius, but 
their effect is more coherent, or less kaleidoscopic, 
than that of earlier versions, which we take to be 
good evidence that they have been intelligently 
translated. The first of them, " The Nameless 
Castle," is provided with a preface by the author 
himself, and a sketch of his activity by " Neltje 
Blanchan " which is appreciative and just. The 
story is of the Napoleonic time, and of the Hun- 
garian army raised in 1809 to resist the invader. It 
has for its heroine a daughter of King Louis XVI., 
saved from her enemies by devoted royalist sympa-

thizers, who centre their hopes in a possible restora- 
tion which shall bring her to the throne of her 
ancestors. Her death makes the device innocent 
enough, a device justified, for the rest, by the inter- 
est of the romance that has been woven about her 
fortunes. 

"An Hungarian Nabob," the second of these 
translations, is one of the author's earlier books, 
having been published nearly half a century ago, 
and pictures Hungarian life in a still earlier period 
of the century, namely, in the twenties. Its interest 
is varied and sustained, and we can easily under- 
stand that it is reckoned among the classics of Hun- 
garian fiction. The translator has taken the liberty 
of cutting out " a good third of the original work," 
in order that the book " should attract at first sight." 
We consider such mutilations unwarrantable, and 
feel bound to protest against them upon every pos- 
sible occasion. 

A young Swedish priest in the district of Varm- 
land is so addicted to drink that he is expelled from 
his parish and becomes an outcast. Filled with re- 
morse, he is about to take his own life, when he is 
saved by a wealthy and philanthropic woman, the 
proprietor of large estates and productive industries. 
This woman has collected about her a number of 
picturesque ne'er-do-weels, who have become her 
pensioners, and whom she provides with a home, 
food, clothing, and whatever else they may want. 
Gosta Berling, the drunken priest, becomes one of 
these pensioners. Presently, through a turn of the 
wheel of fortune, this Lady Bountiful is expelled 
from her home, and the pensioners remain in pos- 
session. They live riotous lives and indulge in 
all sorts of mad freaks. It is evident enough that 
the story thus outlined has unusual originality, and 
promises new sensations even to the most jaded 
taste. But the outline conveys no notion whatever 
of the book itself, for the case is one in which the 
scheme counts for nothing and the treatment for 
everything. Imagine, then, that all of these things 
are told, not as by some first-hand observer, but in 
the form which they have assumed among a super- 
stitious and poetically-minded people after trans- 
mission from mouth to mouth for a hundred years 
or so. The story takes upon itself heroic propor- 
tions, and becomes invested with the attributes of 
the epic. It becomes, in fact, the " saga " of Gosta 
Berling, as the author calls it, and not the " story " 
that the translator has so unhappily preferred to style 
it in the English version. The work is certainly 
impressive, although we cannot say that it is alto- 
gether a work of art. It is too incoherent, too rhap- 
sodical, to deserve that title. But it is an exceed- 
ingly interesting exam pie of what young Scandinavia 
is now doing in literature, for its author, Miss Selma 
Lagerlof, is one of the very newest of Swedish 
writers. Its success, moreover, in its present form, 
has been such as to warrant the speedy preparation 
of another of Miss Lagerlof s romances for the 
English-speaking public, and to this second work 
we will now direct our attention. 



"The Miracles of Antichrist" is a work that 
represents a maturer stage in the development of 
this talented writer, although it still has the inco- 
herent and episodical character of the earlier book. 
In this case, Miss Lagerlof has turned from the 
Swedish to the Sicilian peasantry for her subject, 
and her insight into the racial and temperamental 
characteristics of a people so remote from her own 
is really remarkable. The fantastic basis of the 
story is provided by a false image of the Bambino 
of Aracoeli, which somehow finds its way into a vil- 
lage on Mount JEtna, and is believed to have mirac- 
ulous virtues. It brings various blessings to the 
village folk, but these are of the temporal rather 
than the spiritual sort ; in short, they are the mira- 
cles of Antichrist. In some strange way, not clearly 
worked out, the spirit of socialism is identified with 
Antichrist, and the one who made the falsified 
image scratched upon its crown the inscription : 
" My kingdom is only of this world." There is no 
continuous story of much interest, but there are 
many faithful and sincere studies of character, and 
many portions of the work glow with a strange poet- 
ical beauty. Miss Lagerlof is assuredly a writer to 
be reckoned with in the new development of Scan- 
dinavian literature. 

" Sielanka " is a companion volume to " Hania " 
in the authorized uniform edition of translations 
from Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz, as made by Mr. 
Jeremiah Curtin. It contains seventeen pieces, of 
which nine were published in two small volumes 
several years ago. Of those nine, " Bartek the 
Victor," " Yanko the Musician," and " The Light- 
house Keeper of Aspinwall " have been generally 
recognized as remarkable examples of the short 
story, and they remain the best things in the present 
volume, although we should place with them the 
tragedy called " For Bread," which tells the story 
of two Polish emigrants to the United States. 
Among the remaining pieces are two in dramatic 
form a sketch in one scene, and a five-act drama 
and a vigorous piece of literary criticism hpropos 
of M. Zola's nov.els. 

Readers of " Cosmopolis," that admirable inter- 
national review that came to an untimely end last 
November, were the first to be introduced to the 
examples of female portraiture to which M. Paul 
Bourget gave the collective title of " Voyageuses." 
There were six of them altogether, carefully studied 
pictures of charmingly or pathetically attractive wo- 
men " seen for a week, a day, an hour the romance 
of whose lives I divined (or, perhaps, imagined) from 
some sudden incident of travel." We are glad to 
have these stories in Mr. William Mai-chant's trans- 
lation, which is far above the ordinary level of such 
work, as the stories themselves are above the level 
of the novelist's productions. Indeed, we are im- 
pelled to say that the delicate charm of M. Bourget's 
style, and the penetrative sympathy with which he 
has studied human life, appeal to us more strongly 
from this book than from any other that he has 
written.

"The Secret of Fougereuse " is a romance of 
Provence in the fifteenth century, and is said to be 
taken " from the French." Of the literal truth of 
this statement we have our suspicions, for the name 
of no French author is given, and the romance does 
not read like a translation. At all events, we may 
thank Miss Guiney, whatever the source of her ma- 
terials, for an exquisite piece of literature, and, if it 
be indeed a translation, we can only murmur, si 
sic omnes. The romance is of the time of the crafty 
French monarch who lives forever in the pages of 
" Quentin Durward," although it is more immedi- 
ately connected with the court of the good but weak 
King Rene'. Tout passe fors aymer Dieu is the 
motto of the book, and tells the secret of Guy de 
Fougereuse, the hero. For this brave knight and 
steadfast friend is endowed with spiritual no less 
than with physical heroism, and has no other secret 
than the service of a higher Master than even the 
King. Brought to trial for his life upon charges of 
sorcery, the secret comes out, he is triumphantly 
vindicated, and exchanges the garb of knighthood 
for that of the monk. A still greater triumph awaits 
him when his burning love softens the heart of his 
most malignant foe, and reclaims what had seemed 
to be a spirit hopelessly lost. The religious feature 
of this story is strongly pronounced, but this does not 
prevent it from being a very stirring picture of its 
age, while its style is a constant delight to the sense. 

The last of our present list of books is the 
" Vicomte de Puyjoli," a translation made by Miss 
Emma M. Phelps from the French of M. Jules 
Claretie. It is a romance of the French Revolution, 
with all the familiar accessories unregenerate 
royalists, stern republicans, revolutionary tribunals, 
suspects, Emigres, ci-devants, the statuesque St.- Just, 
the big Danton, the repulsive Marat, and the rest. 
The special hero of the tale is one Charles de la 
Bussiere, a poor player, whose devotion to his friends 
during the dark days of Thermidor saved many 
heads from the guillotine. Hackneyed as the whole 
subject is, it receives fresh interest from M. Clare- 
tie's treatment, and as the story progresses to its 
climax, the attention of its readers becomes almost 
breathless. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



French fiction " A Century of French Fiction" 
of the (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is the latest 

nineteenth century, contribution of Professor Benjamin 
W. Wells to a series of studies in modern European 
literature that have won for their writer a high 
place among our critical essayists. Like its prede- 
cessors, this book is characterized by sobriety of 
judgment and charm of expression, and impresses 
the reader throughout with the painstaking processes 
by which the author approaches whatever task lies 
before him. He discusses, or at least names, no less 
than 688 stories by 115 novelists, and before ven- 



turing to discuss them, has read them all, note-book 
in hand. So we feel confident that his generaliza- 
tions are true critical syntheses, and not the airy 
speculations that are sometimes imposed upon a 
complacent public. The French fiction of the nine- 
teenth century is Mr. Wells's subject, and it is dis- 
cussed in seventeen chapters. Of these, three (or 
about a fourth of the whole book) are devoted to 
Balzac, " the greatest novelist of France, and per- 
haps of the world." Eight other chapters are spe- 
cial studies of Stendhal, Me'rime'e, Gautier, George 
Sand, Flaubert, Daudet, Maupassant, and M. Zola. 
The six remaining chapters are devoted to the con- 
sideration of groups of less important writers. We 
are unable to justify the treatment of Hugo as a 
mere member of the romantic group along with 
Lamartine and Dumas, and for our own part we 
have not the slightest doubt that the excessive crit- 
ical reaction against Hugo, even as a novelist, will 
be followed in the coming century by a swing of the 
pendulum whereby his reputation will come once 
more into its own. But we have no other serious 
quarrel with the perspective in which Mr. Wells 
presents his subjects, and we have taken much satis- 
faction in his lucid expositions. More careful proof- 
reading would have corrected such things as " Cau- 
casse," " Cimourdin," "Listz," " Thernardier," and 
" Le Maitre des Forges "; would probably have 
omitted the second article in "The Cat and the 
Racket "; and would not have left " The Mansion 
of Penarvan " to stand for " La Maison de Penar- 
van." Surely it is not the habitation, but the house, 
in the sense of family, that we are to understand by 
the title of Sandeau's novel. 

A single new letter from Charles 
uterary circle. Lamb to Thomas Manning would be 

sufficient reason, if not sufficient ma- 
terial, for a new volume. Unfortunately, Mr. E. V. 
Lucas is unable to offer us any such Milesian Mul- 
lets : he has letters from Lamb and letters from 
Manning, but not to each other. Robert Lloyd, to 
whom are addressed most of the letters in his volume 
entitled "Charles Lamb and the Lloyds" (Lippin- 
cott), was one of those persons who, though not espe- 
cially remarkable themselves, have the faculty of 
attracting remarkable persons to them. The same 
thing is to be said, perhaps, of his brother; but 
Charles Lloyd probably had more individual genius, 
and therefore was less able to attract and hold the 
regard of other geniuses. For a time, however, 
Charles Lloyd was one of a more brilliant group than 
his brother Robert ever knew: Coleridge, Lamb, 
Wordsworth, Southey, DeQuincey, all in their youth- 
ful days before being really famous. But it would 
seem that Robert had the more attractive character ; 
men took to him more. He was not such a genius 
as his brother, and got no such sermons from Cole- 
ridge ; but then, he got better letters from Charles 
Lamb, which, whether it consoled him or not, is at 
least happy enough for us. Among these young 
people sizzling with genius appears the staid figure

of Charles Lloyd senior, who amuses himself by 
translating Homer into the metre of Pope. This 
harmless occupation has resulted well for humanity, 
in that it brought forth three letters from Miss Anna 
Seward, the Swan of Litchfield, than whom the world 
never knew (in her sex) a more affected book-club 
president. These are newly discovered letters, and 
on the whole the find had something of value. Of 
the letters from Lamb, some are quite charming, 
though none (of course) are quite as good as our old 
favorites. The letters from Coleridge are as foolish 
as he was at the time he wrote them. The letters 
of Miss Seward are so preposterous as to be of great 
value. Several letters of Robert Lloyd's, especially 
those written to his wife during a visit to London, 
are also worth reading. Around these jewels Mr. 
Lucas has arranged a very nice setting of minor 
stones and of the pure and lovely gold of his own 
writing. _ 



The greatness f excellence is main- 

and decay tained by the editor of the " Cam- 

& Spain. bridge Historical Series" (Macmil- 

lan) in the successive volumes on the modern history 
of the great nations of to-day. One of the best is 
Martin A. S. Hume's on " Spain : Its Greatness 
and Decay" (1479-1788). It is a melancholy 
story, for Spain had every advantage for success in 
national development. If only the modern spirit 
could have entered, that unfortunate country would 
not now be the object of the world's contemptuous 
pity. But the Bull-fight and the Inquisition have 
remained typical of Spain's social and religious con- 
dition ; greed and oppression have made up its pol- 
itics. The formation of the centralized monarchy 
by Ferdinand and Isabella, and the glorious reign 
of Carlos I. (Charles V.), are described in an intro- 
duction of a hundred pages by Mr. Edward Arm- 
strong. Then the author takes up the narrative 
with the opening of the reign of Philip II., appar- 
ently the most glorious portion of Spain's history, 
but really the beginning of her decay. All the 
forces that make for national prosperity were neg- 
lected, while Spain went out to do battle for the 
Papal Supremacy and to extirpate all Protestant 
heresy from Europe. The European complications 
and mighty wars that followed are described, at the 
end of which Spain is found exhausted and demor- 
alized, and disappears from active participation in 
the world's affairs. But the main interest is that 
indicated by the sub-title of the book the story of 
the decay of a great nation. The book contains 
bibliography, index, and maps.

something of an achievement. It has

Britain ; and now comes Mrs. Emma Rauschenbusch-

of Women ' " (Longmans), to perform a similar 
service for that widespread and far-reaching move- 
ment which might perhaps be styled the Feminine 
Renaissance. The work is interesting to the gen- 
eral reader and to the historian. Mary Wollstone- 
craft led one of the unhappiest of lives, and the real 
services she rendered her sex have been obscured by 
the more brilliant career of her daughter, the second 
Mary Wollstonecraf t, author of " Frankenstein " 
and wife to the poet Shelley. Mrs. Rauschenbusch- 
Clough gives the facts in the mother's chequered 
life with sympathy and succinctness, and then expa- 
tiates upon her reply to Edmund Burke's " Reflec- 
tions on the Revolution in France," which she fairly 
proves to be the sounding of the first trumpet on 
behalf of a sex which from being " down-trodden " 
is almost taking on the characteristics of the down- 
treading. The influence of this magnum opus on 
contemporaneous thought is the occasion for dis- 
playing a quantity of real erudition, and the chain 
which connects the theoretical " Rights of Woman " 
in 1792 with the practical rights they have secured 
in 1899 is firmly wrought and secure. 

By dint of knocks so hard that they 
become abusive, Mr. David Wilson 
effectually defeats his own object in 
his book on "Mr. Froude and Carlyle" (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). The rather bulky volume is an 
attempt to make Froude out as pretty much every- 
thing a rational man would wish not to be, in revenge 
for the misfortunes of the Carlyle Biography. Even 
if the reader begins the book with strong preposses- 
sions in Mr. Wilson's favor, he will end with the 
conviction that no one can be quite so feeble and 
depraved as Froude is made out to be. There seems 
little reason to doubt the correctness of the author's 
criticism of Froude's course in the publication of 
the letters, etc., but the injustice of attacking his 
personal character and private life, setting him down 
as a hypocrite who bartered his soul for money, as 
a weakling and libertine in one, and a friend delib- 
erately false, is quite too much, and sympathy veers 
to the side of the over-abused. Mr. Wilson, in his 
preface, threatens to write a life of Carlyle himself ; 
if he cannot bring to it a wider range of thought, a 
higher tolerance, and a nobler charity than manifest 
themselves in these pages, the book should remain 
unwritten.

tells us that he has been at work more than twenty 
years in a limited department of biology connected 
with his profession as dentist. He had sought for an 
explanation of observed local defects in individuals, 
and had discovered that the causes were sometimes 
not to be found short of a deep study of the entire 
constitution and heredity. From these personal 
investigations the author was led out into a study of 
the general doctrine of degeneracy, atavism, and 
arrested development, and now gives us a summary

of the teachings of the most important authorities, 
American and European. The discussion is of very 
great social importance, and covers such subjects as 
the stigmata of degeneracy, heredity, atavism, con- 
sanguineous and neurotic marriages, intermixture of 
races, toxic agents, contagious and infectious dis- 
eases, climate, soil, and food, school strain, the de- 
generate cranium, and other anatomical signs, marks 
of reversion, and degeneracy of mentality and mo- 
rality. Parents, teachers, legislators, judges, and 
charity workers need to be familiar with the as- 
sured results and even the hypotheses of this vol- 
ume. The style is necessarily somewhat technical, 
but any intelligent person can, with the occasional 
use of a modern dictionary, apprehend the mean- 
ing. Dr. Talbot has personally made some contri- 
butions to knowledge, and has here put together 
reasonings which should influence social thinking 
and conduct. 

Dr Briggs Back in 1883 Professor Briggs issued

of Scripture. Thig vo i ume proved so popular that 

it has been issued from the press nine times since 
that date. The giant strides made in Biblical meth- 
ods and study since 1883, and the numerous new 
results acquired, demanded a revision of the original 
work. This book, " The Study of Holy Scripture " 
(Seribner), is a revision, with considerable addi- 
tions on the subjects of Canon, Text, Higher Criti- 
cism, Literary Study of the Bible, and Interpreta- 
tion of Scriptures. Many of the 688 pages of this 
new book on careful comparison are identical with 
pages in the 506 of the old book. Others are modi- 
fied by the change of only a few words, while valu- 
able new material adds many new pages and several 
chapters to the book. The original twelve chapters 
have become expanded into twenty-six. It is a pity 
that the whole work could not have been written 
anew. A higher critic can often discover the seams 
between the documents of '83 and those of '98. In 
spite of this unevenness in style and character, the 
author has laid under tribute to his pen the best lit- 
erature extant on the themes he discusses, and the 
literature is cited in foot-notes, by title, volume, 
and page. The style and spirit of the author are 
not always to be commended, especially when he is 
crying down his opponent or dogmatising on the view 
presented. But the addition of new material and a 
new paragraphing of the text constitute the chief 
value of this re-issue of a useful book. 



The famous ^ would, we suspect, be a very dif- 

" common-sense ficult task to narrate the life of 
philosopher." Thomas Reid, and to describe his 
philosophical system in such a way as to enthral the 
reader and at the same time leave him with a clear 
understanding of the famous " Common Sense Phil- 
osophy." In fact, it would not be too easy to effect 
either one of these results, even at the sacrifice of 
the other : of the two, the latter would probably be 
the simpler accomplishment. Reid was a noteworthy 



figure in the history of philosophy. He was certainly 
a famous Scot. As such he deserves the volume by 
Professor Campbell Fraser which has recently ap- 
peared in the " Famous Scots " series (imported by 
Scribner). The volume will certainly be of more 
interest to one who wishes to get a general idea of 
Reid's philosophy than to one who has only an intel- 
ligent curiosity on biography in general. Yet Pro- 
fessor Campbell Fraser tells the life easily, and gives 
us a curious picture of retired eighteenth-century 
university existence. Those who look a little into 
philosophy will probably like the book best ; but 
others, with a more merely human interest, will be 
likely to find something to their minds.

anonymously by Messrs. H. S. Stone 
& Co., could readily have a review extending into 
a history of the American people, so many and so 
varied are the causes which make a demand for 
such a treatise. This, like others of its kind, is a 
vade mecum for the manufacture of aristocrats out 
of the most variously assorted material imaginable. 
It is the work of a woman evidently a bright one 
and is intended for those who have passed the 
self-made stage and are preparing to enter the upper 
walks of life as ready-made. It is humorous, as 
such books must always be, but it differs from others 
in having its humor known by its writer. There 
is a chapter on the " Treatment of Reporters," 
which is a gem in its patronage of that useful ad- 
junct to social distinction. (See Dooley on Golf, 
passim). _ 

Dr. L. Forbes Winslow, one of the 
greatest of English alienists, has col- 
lected some of the results of his sci- 
entific studies and observations in a volume entitled 
" Mad Humanity " (M. F. Mansfield & Co.). How 
ignorant the world at large is regarding the import- 
ant topic of insanity, these pages abundantly prove ; 
for, though the malady is a growing one and pecu- 
liarly a concomitant of civilization so-called, Dr. 
Winslow shows that we still retain something of the 
superstition which made the insane in a special 
sense the work of the Almighty. The work is pro- 
fusely illustrated, is dedicated to Lombroso, and the 
voice of authority speaks from its many pages.

the Riviera" (Macmillan). There are no scientific 
nor historical truths enunciated which are not suffi- 
ciently well known, and the author has been satis- 
fied to go to popular sources for the little learning 
which he expends on his subject not always with 
accuracy. He was in the Riviera with nothing else 
to do, the little towns of ancient birth and mediaeval 
fortification attracted him, and he wandered about 
among them, obtaining exercise and sufficient men-

tal occupation to keep him satisfied for the time. 
Then be mistook the interest he had taken in the 
matter for a general interest, and put forth a book 
which will do no particular good, has no particu- 
lar reason for existence, and can do no particular 
harm. 



BRIEFER MENTION, 



Mr. Frank Russell's unbound volume of " Explora- 
tions in the Far North " (University of Iowa Press) 
contains an account, quite fully illustrated from photo- 
graphs, of a collector's journeys in the Mackenzie River 
Region and the Barren Grounds of British America. 
Descriptions are given of the native manner of life, 
including a record of some Cree Myths; and there is 
much about the animal life of the country, with a chap- 
ter on musk-ox hunting. The work is plainly and suc- 
cinctly written, and is of considerable interest and value. 

With the twelfth volume of the " Biographical " 
Thackeray (Harper), we come within one of the last, 
and Mrs. Ritchie's memoranda take on a melancholy 
tinge, although greatly softened in the retrospect, as she 
nears the closing years of her father's life. Indeed, 
these pages seem to be the end of the random biography, 
for they tell of Thackeray's brief illness and peaceful 
death. The contents of this volume are : " The Wolves 
and the Lamb," " Lovel the Widower," the " Round- 
about Papers," and the torso of " Denis Duval," includ- 
ing a hitherto unprinted chapter of that novel, which 
might have been the author's greatest, had he lived to 
complete it. 

The treatise of Egidio Colonna's " De Regimine Prin- 
cipiuin" was written about 1286, and, after the inven- 
tion of printing went through no less than eleven editions, 
from 1473 to 1617. A French translation, or " rather 
a cleverly prepared version " of the work forms the 
contents of an interesting thirteenth century MS. owned 
by Mr. J. E. Kerr, Jr., of New York, and this is now 
published, with notes, under the editorship of Dr. Sam- 
uel Paul Molenaer. The title is " Li Livres du Gouv- 
ernement des Rois," and the whole material offered 
makes a handsome volume of nearly five hundred pages, 
issued by the Macmillan Co. for the Columbia Univer- 
sity Press. 

A sixth volume in the uniform " Eversley " edition of 
Richard Holt Hutton's writings has just been published 
by the Macmillan Co. with the title, " Aspects of Re- 
ligious and Scientific Thought." Like earlier volumes 
of this edition, the contents are reprinted from " The 
Spectator," where they did service as leaders or reviews. 
There are more than fifty of them in all, upon a great 
variety of subjects, mostly of an interest sufficiently per- 
manent to warrant this reproduction in attractive book 
form. 

The " American Art Annual " for 1898 is the first 
volume of what we trust may prove to be a long-lived 
series. Its chief feature is a classified list of galleries, 
private collections, societies, and schools, classified ac- 
cording to cities, and filling over three hundred pages. 
We have besides directories of artists, institutions, and 
dealers, reviews of the year at home and abroad, sales 
and exhibitions of the past and coining years, obituary 
notices, and special articles. The work is abundantly 
illustrated. Miss Florence N. Levy is the editor, and 
the Macmillan Co. have undertaken the publication. 



IiITERAKY NOTES. 



The third volume of North's Plutarch and De Quin- 
cey's " Confessions of an English Opium Eater " are the 
latest additions to the Dent-Macmillan series of " Tem- 
ple Classics." 

" Composition," by Mr. Arthur W. Dow, is " a series 
of exercises from a new system of art education," pub- 
lished in a handsome quarto volume by Mr. J. M. 
Bowles, of Boston. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. publish " An Intro- 
duction to the Differential and Integral Calculus and 
Differential Equations," by Mr. F. Glanville Taylor. It 
is a volume of between five and six hundred pages. 

Mr. James Henry Brownlee is the compiler, and the 
Werner Co. the publishers, of a volume of verses, mostly 
doggerel, called " War-Time Echoes," relating to (we 
can hardly say inspired by) the recent war on Spain. 

" The Return of the O'Mahony," by no means the 
poorest of the late Harold Frederic's novels, although 
not nearly as well known as the others, has just been 
published in a new edition by the G. W. Dillingham Co. 

There are a few additional poems in the edition of 
Miss Lilian Whiting's "From Dreamland Sent," just 
issued by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co.; otherwise the 
volume contains the matter published in the first edi- 
tion, four years ago. 

" Rontgen Rays," translated and edited by Dr. George 
F. Barker; and "The Modern Theory of Solution," 
translated and edited by Dr. Harry C. Jones, form the 
third and fourth volumes in the series of " Scientific 
Memoirs " published by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Two little booklets that should find favor with col- 
lectors of " Kiplingiana " have been published recently 
by Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & A. Wessels. The first 
is a study of " The Religion of Kipling," by Mr. W. B. 
Parker, associate editor of the "Atlantic Monthly";, 
the second, a reprint of two issues of the Horsmonden 
School " Budget " containing a facetious letter from 
Mr. Kipling, together with Mr. Max Beerbohm's cari- 
cature of the writer. 

Professor Edwin A. Grosvenor's " Contemporary His- 
tory of the World " (Crowell) " attempts to outline the 
most prominent political events in Europe and North 
America during the last fifty years." It was planned 
in some sort as a continuation of Duruy's " General 
History," which stops at 1848, and the same general 
method and manner of narration are employed. The 
same publishers send us a new edition of Duruy's "An- 
cient History " in Professor Grosvenor's revision. 

The first annotated edition of " Cyrano de Bergerac " 
for the classroom has just been issued by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. The editor, Professor Oscar Kuhns, 
gives much interesting light on the manners of the 
times, and on the historic persons who suggested the 
characters to M. Rostand. He also gives Coquelin's 
description of the first night, and of his acquaintance 
with the author. Special emphasis is laid on the play 
as a picture of an interesting period, as well as on its 
theatrical effectiveness. 

Sir Frederick Pollock's " Spinoza: His Life and 
Philosophy " (Macmillan) has been for some score of 
years the standard English work upon the great philos- 
opher whose thought has so deeply penetrated the con- 
sciousness of our time, and seems to grow more modern 
with the passing centuries. We are now glad to note 
the appearance of a second edition, which was greatly

needed in view of the new material for the study of 
Spinoza provided by recent scholarly investigations. 
Only the later additions to Spinoza bibliography now 
appear in the introduction, and for such references as 
were previously included readers are directed to Van 
der Linde and the British Museum catalogue. The life 
by Colerus (London, 1706) " done out of French," serves 
as an appendix. 

Amidst the hurly-burly of hasty books on the Spanish 
war, we are glad to see a revival of interest in works 
relating to the more heroic period of the Rebellion. 
Besides the really great book on Stonewall Jackson 
(reviewed in this issue), we have had new biographies 
of Generals Meade and Sherman, and, more recently, 
of Secretary Stanton and Thaddeus Stevens the latter 
two certainly among the most striking and picturesque 
subjects to be found in American public life. 

The recent popular clamor in England for a moderate- 
priced edition of FitzGerald's " transversion " of the 
Rubaiyat has at last been met by Messrs. Macmillan, 
the holders of the English copyright, who now issue 
the work in their familiar " Golden Treasury Series." 
The full text of the first and fourth editions is given, 
together with FitzGerald's introduction and notes, the 
text of the stanzas which appeared in the second edi- 
tion only, a list of all variations between the four 
editions, and a comparative table of stanzas. It is alto- 
gether safe to say that FitzGerald's immortal rendering 
has reached its definitive form in this tasteful and 
inexpensive edition.

rpHE Proprietors who in 1861 purchased the Spectator have since that 
date conducted it themselves. They are therefore exempted from 
many influences which press severely on the independence of jour- 
nalism, and have from the first made it their chief object to say out 
what they believe to be truth in theology, politics, and social questions, 
irrespective, not only of opposition from without, but of the opinion of 
their own supporters. Their object is to reflect the opinion of cultivated 
Liberals, but in the matter of the American War they fought against 
the mass of the very class they are trying to represent, and were finally 
acknowledged by them to have been in the right. 

The news of the current week is compressed into an animated nar- 
rative, which the laziest or busiest may read, without missing the life 
or import of the events. 

The Spectator contains a list of all Books published during the week 
(not under one shilling in price), with the names of the publishers and 
the prices attached, a feature which will greatly increase its value to 
booksellers, librarians, literary institutions, and private gentlemen.

George Borrow. 

The Life, Writings, and Correspondence of George 
Borrow, 1803-1881. Based on Official and Other 
Authentic Sources. By WILLIAM I. KNAPP, Ph.D. 
In 2 vols. With 22 Illustrations. 8vo, $6.00. 
George Borrow was born in East Dereham, Norfolk, En- 
gland, in 1803. He spent much of his time studying languages, 
for which he had a great gift, acquiring among other tongues 
that of the gypsies. After much adventurous roaming and 
many struggles, in 1833 he received the appointment as agent 
of the British and Foreign Bible Society, in which capacity 
he travelled extensively, learning with marvellous ease the 
language of each country visited by him. He was noted for 
his eccentricities, his fondness for the gypsies, his passion for 
athletic exercises, his scorn for the gentilities of life, and his 
vigorous advocacy of the doctrines of the Church of England. 
Borrow was the author of many works and translations, the 
most important of these being " Lavengro " and " The Bible 
in Spain.' 7 

Gladstone. 

The Life of William Ewart Gladstone. Edited by Sir 
WEMYSS REID. In 2 vols. With over 200 Illustra- 
tions. 8vo, per set, $4.50. 

Mr. Gladstone's life was so full and his interests and work 
were so diverse that the editor of this biography, Sir Wemyss 
Reid, felt the expediency of dividing the many phases of his 
subject's career and character for treatment among different 
writers, each the person most fitted by association with Mr. 
Gladstone,' or by knowledge of public affairs, to discuss the 
subject treated by him. In the editing the various contribu- 
tions have been welded into a harmonious and well-balanced 
biography. Among the contributors are Canon MacColl, 
G. W. E. Russell, Henry W. Lucy, Arthur J. Butler, Alfred 
F. Robbins, F. W. Hirst, and others. 

The People of England 

in the 19th Century. 

By JUSTIN MCCARTHY, M.P. In 2 vols. Nos. 53 and 
54 in The Story of the Nations Series. Fully Illus- 
trated. Large 12mo, each $1.50. 

" The Story of England's Nineteenth Century" isa picture, 
rather than a record of England's development in all the arts 
of peace since the close of the great war with Napoleon. Since 
that time a complete revolution has taken place in all that 
relates to applied and industrial science. Railways, ocean 
steamships, the electric telegraph, the submarine cable, the 
telephone all these are the growth of this wonderful cen- 
tury, which has done more for the practical movement of civ- 
ilization than all the centuries that went before. The portraits 
of the great men who led all these different movements are 
carefully and vividly drawn, and the object is to impress the 
mind of the reader with a clear idea of each man and of each 
man's work in that period of English history.

Mr. Bruce is an authority on Alaska, having travelled for 
ten years in the territory in the interest of the government 
and also in connection with private enterprises. Mr. Bruce's

detailed information concerning its resources, these compris- 
ing among other things, minerals, fur, timber, and fish. The 
work also contains a full description of the various mining

and other French theatres, and cuts illustrative of tastes and 
manners especially with reference to the drama, M. Jusserand 
has studied the story of the fame enjoyed by Shakespeare in 
France in the two last centuries. Mole, Mile. Fleury, Talma, 
Clairon, Le Kain, Garrick, Mrs. Siddons, have their part to 
play in the story, which is carried, in an epilogue, down to the 
1830 romantic movement, and to our own days. 

Industrial Cuba. 

Being a Study of Present Commercial and Industrial 
Conditions, with Suggestions as to the Opportunities 
presented in the Island for American Capital, Enter- 
prise, and Labor. By ROBERT P. PORTER, Special Com- 
missioner for the United States, Cuba, and Porto Rieo. 
With 62 Illustrations and 4 Maps. 8vo, 438 pages. 

This volume deals with the economic and political condi- 
tion and outlook in Cuba. It deals with the live questions in 
that island, which are interesting every intelligent citizen in 
the United States. There is literally no chapter in it that does 
not have some bearing, and which does not give useful infor- 
mation on the problems which the Administration is endeav- 
oring to solve, and which General Brooke and his staff of 
provincial governors are at this moment working to solve sat- 
isfactorily to the people of Cuba. 

Two Women in the Klondike. 

The Story of a Journey to the Gold-Fields of Alaska. 
By MARY E. HITCHCOCK. With a Map of Alaska and 
105 Illustrations from Photographs. 8vo, 500 pages. 

The volume presents the record of a journey undertaken 
in the summer of 1898 to the gold-fields of Alaska. Mrs. 
Hitchcock's journal is a faithful record of her experiences, 
and is written in a vivacious manner and is full of interesting 
incidents. The volume is enriched by over 100 illustrations, 
and will contain an authoritative map of Alaska, showing the 
trails and steamboat routes to the gold-fields. 

Children of the Mist. 

By EDEN PHILLPOTS, author of " Down Dartmoor 
Way," Lying Prophets," etc. 8vo, $1.50. 

R. D. BLACKMOKE, the author of " Lorna Doone," writes 
concerning the book : " Knowing nothing of the writer or his 
works, I was simply astonished at the beauty and power of 
this novel. But true as it is to life and place, full of deep 
interest, rare humor, and vivid descriptions, there seemed to 
be risk of its passing unheeded in the crowd and rush and 
ruck of fiction. . . . Literature has been enriched with a 
wholesome, genial, and noble tale, the reading of which is a 
pleasure in store for many."

THE MENACE TO FREE DISCUS- 
SION. 

The opponents of the imperial policy in gen- 
eral, and of our unconstitutional Philippine war 
in particular, have good cause for congratula- 
tion in the outburst of fanatical intolerance 
which their defense of the fundamental princi- 
ples of democratic civilization has recently 
evoked. This sort of bigotry, arrogating to 
itself the name of patriotism, might be a dan- 
gerous symptom in any body politic less organ- 
ically sound than the American ; but in our 
own case it may hardly be considered more 
serious than a severe fever that will run its 
course and pass away. The American public 
may for a time be deluded by dreams of empire 
and the imaginary duty of assuming " bur- 
dens," but we cannot believe that it has lapsed 
for good from the faith that has made our na- 
tion great, and we are quite certain that it is 
sound at heart where the great question of free 
speech and the expression of honest convictions 
is concerned. 

The fever that is temporarily upon us should 
not, however, be left exactly to the vis medi- 
catrix naturae when its mitigation by rational 
appliances is possible, although one is strongly 
tempted so to leave it by certain of its manifes- 
tations. When, for example, it takes the fat- 
uous form of denouncing as unpatriotic and 
even treasonable the attitude and the utterances 
of those whom sober-minded Americans most 
delight to honor of such men as ex-Presidents 
Cleveland and Harrison, Senators Hoar and 
Edmunds, Bishops Potter and Spalding, Presi- 
dents Eliot and Rogers and Jordan, Professors 
James, Laughlin, and Sumner, and Messrs. 
Godkin, Schurz, and Charles Francis Adams 
its very violence affords the best promise of a 
speedy recovery. One would hardly resent for 
himself any kind of epithet that associated him 
with such men as these ; the attribution would 
arouse, rather than any personal feeling (save 
that of pride in the association), a sense of 
mingled indignation and contempt for those who 
could prefer so ridiculous a charge against so 
distinguished a company.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



But the philosopher, however clearly he may 
foresee the outcome of the conflict, is not 
thereby justified in holding himself aloof from 
the field, when there is any possibility that his 
efforts may hasten the desired end. It is, then, 
quite impossible for us to pass by without com- 
ment certain recent exhibitions of the spirit of 
intolerance in dealing with the question that 
so gravely concerns our country at the present 
day. There are many indications of an attempt, 
tacitly or otherwise concerted, on the part of 
those who support the Philippine policy of the 
Administration, to terrorize its opponents into 
silence until the nation shall have become so 
far committed to its present course that with- 
drawal will be practically impossible. No one 
can examine with a candid mind the ephemeral 
literature of this subject without recognizing 
the fact that, broadly speaking, the appeal of 
the anti-imperialists is an appeal to reason, 
while the appeal of the imperialists is an ap- 
peal to sentiment, to prejudice, to passion, to 
everything, in a word, that is not reason or 
akin to it. 

Things have come to a grave pass indeed, 
although we persist in regarding the aberration 
as merely temporary, when so many organs of 
public opinion have nothing better with which 
to meet the arguments of those who oppose our 
present administrative course than the old cry, 
" My country, right or wrong," and the studied 
use of invective. In the last analysis, this is 
the essential argument and this the character- 
istic method of the agencies that have rallied 
to the support of the war against the Philippine 
people as it was of those that rallied to the sup- 
port of the war against Spain. Even the abusive 
term " copperhead," which has lost little of its 
virulence in the years that have passed since 
its invention, is now freely applied by reckless 
editors and clergymen to men of national rep- 
utation whose every word and deed has always 
been inspired by the loftiest ideals and the 
finest patriotism. There is no American now 
living, for example, who deserves better of his 
fellow-countrymen than Mr. Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton, who represents more adequately the higher 
American conscience, just as Lowell and Curtis 
represented it when their voices were still raised 
in admonition and appeal ; yet Mr. Norton, for 
his courage in giving utterance to his deepest 
convictions upon the events of the past year, 
has been subjected to violent denunciation, 
frantically undignified, and from every point 
of view unworthy of the traditions of American 
manhood. 



A still more serious menace to the right of 
free discussion is afforded by the case of Mr. 
Edward Atkinson, now fresh in the public 
mind. Wanton calumny and wilful misrepre- 
sentation could not well go farther than they 
have done in this instance. Every intelligent 
American knows Mr. Atkinson to be a scholar 
of the highest distinction and a gentleman who 
illustrates the best type of American citizen- 
ship. Yet the newspaper press of the country 
has busied itself of late with the circulation of 
reports skilfully fabricated for the purpose of 
bringing him into disrepute. He has been 
charged with attempts to create sedition among 
our soldiers in the Philippine Islands by send- 
ing them pamphlets in which they are coun- 
selled to disobey orders and even to desert from 
the ranks. That such a story as this could be 
believed by any rational being is a significant 
illustration of the present excited temper of 
the public mind, and indicates a danger that 
should be faced before it assumes uncontrolla- 
ble dimensions. 

The simple facts of the case are these : Mr. 
Atkinson prepared two pamphlets in which his 
views of war in general, and of the present war 
in particular, were set forth with the cogent 
logic of which he is so complete a master. These 
pamphlets were introduced into the debates of 
Congress at its last session and printed as pub- 
lic documents of the United States government. 
About three weeks ago, " moved by a sense of 
profound indignation because it was said that 
parents of Nebraska volunteers in the Philip- 
pines were not allowed to communicate with 
their sons, and for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether or not the United States mails were or 
were not open to the citizens of the United 
States residing in Manila," Mr. Atkinson noti- 
fied the administration that he wished to send 
some pamphlets to the islands, and, receiving 
no reply, made a test case by posting copies of 
these pamphlets to Admiral Dewey, the chief 
officers of the army, and the members of the 
Peace Commission to eight persons alto- 
gether. " If this be treason, make the most of 
it," Mr. Atkinson might well say, and a sensa- 
tional newspaper press certainly has made the 
most of it. When we read that the Cabinet, 
in solemn conclave, has taken measures to ex- 
clude these pamphlets from the mails, we seem 
to be dealing with government as it is pictured 
in comic opera rather than as it is practised by 
a great nation. And when we recall the fact 
that the pamphlets thus excluded are public 
documents of the United States Senate, we may

THE DIAL

get some notion of what Senator Hoar meant 
the other day when he spoke of taking up this 
subject upon some future occasion. 

One more illustration of the existing menace 
to free discussion, and we have done. The 
meeting held in Chicago on the thirtieth of 
April for the purpose of protesting against the 
war in the Philippines was so notable for the 
sober dignity of the addresses made, for the 
deep earnestness with which they were received, 
and for the high character of the immense au- 
dience which the occasion brought together, 
that it made a profound impression upon the 
public mind. The presiding officer of this 
meeting was President Henry Wade Rogers, of 
the Northwestern University, and his special 
contribution to the programme was a statement 
of the Philippine question from the standpoint 
of international law, upon which he is an emi- 
nent authority. The conditions under which 
Dr. Rogers was placed invested his activity 
upon this occasion with an unusual degree of 
moral courage, and all fair-minded persons, 
whether they may agree with his opinions or 
not, will hold him higher in their esteem than 
ever before, just because he has convictions, 
and recognizes the duty of giving them utter- 
ance, whatever the cost. The way in which 
Dr. Rogers has been attacked, during the past 
fortnight, by ribald newspapers and hot-headed 
individuals, is perhaps the best illustration that 
has yet come to our notice of the malign influ- 
ences that are now at work endeavoring to 
stifle free discussion by terrorism, and is cer- 
tainly a disgrace to our civilization. But such 
an incident as this, however unpleasant to 
chronicle as it is at the time, is really a hope- 
ful happening, and impels us to recur directly 
to what we would have our readers take for the 
keynote of the present discussion namely : 
that with a public like ours, intolerance always 
reacts upon the intolerant, and prepares the 
way for its own discomfiture. 



" BALLADS, Critical Reviews, Tales, Various Essays, 
Letters, Sketches, etc." make up the miscellaneous con- 
tents of the thirteenth and last volume of the " biog- 
raphical " Thackeray (Harper). It proves to be the 
stoutest volume of the thirteen, and surprisingly inter- 
esting. Mrs. Ritchie's introduction alone extends to 
upwards of eighty pages, and her random biography, 
now completed, is here supplemented by a reprint of 
Mr. Leslie Stephen's article on Thackeray written for 
the " Dictionary of National Biography." There are 
nearly two hundred and fifty pages of the poems alone 
a quantity of matter far greater than most readers 
imagine, and the illustrations provided with this vol- 
ume are unusually numerous and interesting. 



THE KIPLING HYSTERIA. 

Only the hardihood of intense conviction, coupled 
with a stern sense of duty, impels men, as a rule, 
to advance an opinion diametrically opposite to the 
general, at a time when that general opinion has 
developed into a cult, and a cult militant to boot. 
But there is always high need, in all matters human, 
of men who are willing to stand alone or with few 
at their side. 

In the domain of letters proper there is perhaps 
no such constant necessity for this as in civics, pol- 
itics, or religious affairs. Yet we note in literary 
annals how frequently the protesting voice of one 
period becomes the commanding voice of another. 
The voices of Wordsworth and Shelley, for exam- 
ple, though promulgating different protests and 
artistic preachments, combined to influence for the 
better the makers of English verse in the last half 
century. To less trivial themes, to loftier views of 
the function of Art, they directly and indirectly 
incited ; and to a straightforwardness and simplic- 
ity of style, in the main, that reached its highest 
and most shining point in the calm work of Tenny- 
son, concerning whom our best critical writer has 
said : " His alone are idiosyncratic poems. By the 
enjoyment or non-enjoyment of the ' Morte D' Ar- 
thur ' or of the ' (Enone ' I would test anyone's 
ideal sense. Other bards produce effects which are, 
now and then, otherwise produced than by what we 
call poems ; but Tennyson, an effect which only a 
poem does." 

Now we have recently been commanded by a 
storm of tongues to consider that the true poetic 
heir of Alfred the Great has arrived in the pictur- 
esque person of Rudyard Kipling. He has been 
acclaimed the laureate of the Anglo-Saxon race 
which, however, as an ethnic entity has about as 
much vital value as Sairy Gamp's mysterious chum, 
Mrs. Harris ; and a prodigious amount of hyster- 
ical and chimerical stuff has been written of him, 
and even to him, by disciples and imitators toward 
whom he doubtless entertains a feeling compound 
of ennui and contempt. 

To this hysteria of unreasoned admiration, to this 
toy tempest of flatulent adulation, the dangerous 
illness of this forceful and brilliant writer has nat- 
urally given increase. But already signs of a reac- 
tion are appearing. Trained minds are beginning 
to question the new gospel of poesy and morals, art 
and ethics, as enunciated by and personified in this 
immensely clever and uniquely interesting English- 
man. Dr. Felix Adler recently, while cheerfully 
admitting the talents of Kipling, dared to denounce 
his teaching as a gospel of force, pernicious in the 
extreme and antagonistic to the true spirit of democ- 
racy and of civilization. It is not, however, with 
Kipling's jingoism and frank cynicism toward infe- 
rior races, as the Apostle of Force, of Might against 
Right, that literature is concerned, except inasmuch 
as these essentially pagan and very antiquated sen- 
timents might be shown to affect his art.

Since the writer of this was one of the first, if 
not the very first, of American reviewers to call 
attention to Kipling's powers as a composer of short 
stories, he cannot be accused of any animosity on 
this point. Indeed, he maintained stoutly the rare 
promise indicated in the early output, when other 
critics were deriding it, and even Mr. Howells 
to adopt the amusing phrase of a New York jour- 
nal was " refusing Kipling a niche in the Temple 
of Fame," probably because Mr. Howells had been 
too lavish of his niches, and had n't any fresh ones 
on hand just then, with the varnish dry and war- 
ranted not to crack. 

But how has that early promise been kept? Bet- 
ter than most early promises, beyond a doubt ; yet, 
while in the realm of the short story Kipling stands 
with Cable and Bret Harte, can he sanely be said 
to overtop them ; and has he as a presenter of hu- 
man character come anywhere near Thackeray or 
George Eliot to say nothing of Balzac ? Stress 
is laid on the extraordinary familiarity he shows 
with the technics and terminologies of different occu- 
pations and trades. But all that sort of stuff can 
be easily " crammed." Any first-rate journalist will 
turn out a story on a subject of which he knew 
naught forty-eight hours before, if he can get access 
to a good library or even mingle socially for a few 
hours with men who have the terms of that subject 
at their tongue's end. 

In the loftier region of poetry, what has Kipling 
done that should make him a laureate of the Anglo- 
Saxon race, even supposing there were such a thing? 
Can any calmly critical mind regard the " Barrack- 
Room Ballads " as more than clever ephemeralities, 
destined not even to the same place in future liter- 
ary estimation as Lowell's " Biglow Papers " now 
hold? The "Last Chantey," though marred by 
several serious blemishes in technique, strikes a bold, 
high note, and makes a felicitous nuptial of the gro- 
tesque and sublime which would have delighted that 
master in similar effects, Edgar Poe. The " Mary 
Gloster," though somewhat too risque", Virginians 
pnerisque, is a piece of rare power; and some 
other things in like wise undoubtedly entitle Kipling 
to serious consideration as a poet. 

But, on the other hand, are not the most of his 
verses on the same plane with the work of many 
minor English and American poets ; and are not 
some, which have achieved wide popularity, echoes 
of other bards? Such phrases as "Euchred God 
Almighty's storm," " Bluffed the Eternal Sea," 
must have raised an amused and flattered smile on 
Bret Harte's face; and the metrical manner of 
" The Vampire " is that of Poe in his ballad of 
" Annabel Lee " a rather bad manner, too, in 
some thinking, or, at least, one close to triviality. 
The phrase " hank of hair," by the bye, is " rem- 
inisced " from Browning's poem " James Lee's 
Wife." 

As for the much-belauded " Recessional," while 
the sentiment, aside from laying claim to Jehovah 
as peculiarly the God of the English, is far healthier, 



saner, and more to the purpose of civilization, than 
much of Kipling's, who will seriously assert that so 
far as technique or style goes there are not a dozen 
Englishmen who could have put the case as well or 
better? Mr. Austin doesn't count for much, of 
course, though that luckless official laureate has 
written some good verses ; but, surely, Henley, or 
Rennell Rodd, has given earnest of better work 
than this. And if we may venture to consider 
critically that jingo jingle, " The White Man's 
Burden " entirely apart from its horrible cynical 
indifference to the plainest facts of modern history, 
what can be said in defense of its style? Taking 
the same measure as that of Heber's noble hymn 
" From Greenland's Icy Mountains," to do which 
in itself seems like a covert sneer against the spirit 
of Christianity, the laureate of the Anglo-Saxon 
myth falls far behind the good, unlaurelled bishop 
in technique, as anyone can see by comparing the 
two productions. Heber's is double-rhymed, flow- 
ing, musical : and without rhetorical inversions of 
phrase. It leaves on the inner ear of the mind, as 
on the outer, a sense of beauty as well as a sense of 
benevolence. Kipling's is calculated to make those 
who "learn Messiah's name" learn it chiefly to 
curse with. 

Must not a great poet be a reflector, at least, 
if not an inspirer, of the noblest passions of 
his age and of the unfolding spirit of general hu- 
manity ? 

How much nobler than anything Kipling has cas- 
ually emitted in his glorifications of force or his 
clanging apotheoses of machinery, British muscle 
and British trade, are these quiet lines of Rennell 
Rodd a name dimly known to his own country- 
men, and not at all to us ! Singing to future men 
of Future Man, this poet declares : 

" They shall build their new romances, new dreams of a world 

to be; 
Conceive a snblimer outcome than the end of the world 

we see ; 
And their maids shall be pure as morning and their youth 

shall be taught no lie ; 
But all shall be smooth and open to all men beneath the 

sky. 
And the shadow shall 'pass that we dwell in, till under the 

self-same sun 
The names of the myriad nations are writ in the name of 

one." 

Not writ by the sword, ye semi-civilized Apostles 
and Disciples of Force and Fraud, but by the pen. 
It is this lamentable large lack in the spirit, in the 
outlook and the insight, in the foresight, if you will, 
of the richly-endowed man of talent, now recipient 
of so much loose laudation in American-speaking 
lands, which moves a warm admirer of his talent, 
and of all talents, to assert that, unless that lack 
shall be remedied, he has not the making of a great, 
enduring poet. That he may break away from 
false ideals, and renounce bad literary manners, 
remains a hope. He is yet gloriously young, and 
to youth all things are possible.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE PASSING OF THE MAN-POET. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the current issue of " The Nation," the reviewer 
of recent poetry rightly finds that the best of that poetry 
is by women. There is nothing surprising in this. It 
is more surprising that, as opinion trends, there should 
now be any poetry at all to speak of that is not by women. 
The fact is, men (manly men, I mean) are growing more 
and more shy of writing poetry, or at least of letting 
people know they do it, because they feel that a man 
making verses is more or less a ridiculous object. So 
if they do make verses it is usually sub rosa, in the 
secresy of their sanctums, and with every precaution 
against being caught red-handed in the act. Our age 
is practical. The sensibility that men used a hundred 
years ago to pride themselves on is nowadays looked on 
as a weakness in men at least. Prose is felt to be 
the essentially masculine form of expression, and the 
more prosaic the prose the more masculine it is felt to 
be. The old lurking popular notion that there is some- 
thing unmanly, or unmasculine, in the make-up of the 
poet has gained ground. As Justin McCarthy says 
somewhere, " A poet, with a great many people, seems 
a sort of woman." They expect to find him as Chi- 
cago's acute thinker, " Mr. Dooley," expected to find Mr. 
Richard Harding Davis "in a shirt-waist." They 
accept him grudgingly as a man, an all-round manly 
man, only on condition that his poetry is essentially 
good strong prose, virile prose cut up in lengths, like 
Mr. Kipling's. Their gorge rises at the notion of a big, 
brawny, bearded he-creature like Tennyson, with the 
frame of a coal-heaver and the face of a buccaneer, 
chirping about " Airy, fairy Lilian," crooning cradle- 
songs, or caterwauling in erotic strain over love and the 
moon. This current impression of a hard-fact, practical 
age the impression, namely, that writing verse is an 
effeminate pursuit has to be reckoned with by men 
who want to keep the respect of their ruggeder fellows. 
Will anyone deny that Mr. Lecky went down several 
pegs in the estimation of the practical world as a virile 
philosophic thinker the moment he shocked his friends 
with that ill-omened volume of verse ? That the book 
contained proof positive that Mr. Lecky was not a poet 
did not much help the matter, for few people read it. 
In fine, the trend of opinion points to the eventual van- 
ishing of the man-poet. This view will probably find 
small grace in your eyes; and to forestall rebuke I sub- 
scribe myself PHILISTER.

TENNYSON BIBLIOGRAPHIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Within very recent years at least four noteworthy 
bibliographies of Tennyson's works have appeared : Dr. 
Van Dyke's in the Study of Tennyson (now in its tenth 
edition), Professor Dixon's in his Tennyson Primer, 
Lord Tennyson's in the Memoir, and Dr. Rolfe's in the 
Cambridge Tennyson. Students of the poet are under 
the greatest obligation to these workers, for they have 
given us a substantially correct and complete list of all 
his most important works. Especially must we who are 
unfortunately isolated from great libraries cherish the 
sense of personal gratitude for these guides through 
Tennyson land. 

There is one respect, however, in which these other- 
wise excellent guides are likely to lead the special stu- 



dent astray: they give so much that they tempt us to 
believe they give all. But this they do not do. For 
example, no one mentions a later edition of the " Poems " 
than the eighth, published in 1853, and having men- 
tioned so many the natural inference is that this eighth 
edition was the last. The mind is lead almost unavoid- 
ably to this conclusion in following the very full lists 
of Dr. Van Dyke and Professor Dixon, where complete- 
ness seems to be aimed at. But the fact is, however, 
that between the year 1853, when the eighth edition was 
published, and the year 1872, when according to Prof- 
essor Dixon the next edition appeared, there were issued 
no less than eleven editions, as follows: the ninth in 
1853, the tenth in 1855, eleventh in 1856, twelfth in 
1858, thirteenth in 1860, fourteenth in 1862, fifteenth 
in 1863, sixteenth in 1864, seventeenth in 1865, eight- 
eenth in 1866, and the unnumbered edition by Strahan 
& Co. in 1870. These are all, except the last, from the 
same (Moxon) press as the earlier editions; are num- 
bered as above; and corrections and additions, slight 
to be sure, are found in most of them; so that they 
deserve a place in a complete bibliography. 

What is true of the " Poems " is equally true of " The 
Princess," " In Memoriam," " Maud," and the " Idylls 
of the King." Professor Dixon mentions no later edi- 
tion of " In Memoriam " than the fourth published in 
1851, nor any later of The Princess " than the fifth in 
1853, nor any later of " Maud " than the second in 1856. 
But there are many later editions, not mere reprints 
but numbered editions usually with alterations. Of 
" In Memoriam " there are at least eighteen editions, 
of " The Princess " seventeen, and of " Maud " four- 
teen. Some of these later editions are of much import- 
ance, for example, the sixth of " In Memoriam." 

Excellent as are these lists already published, still it 
is evident that an exhaustive bibliography of Tennyson's 
works is a desideratum.

BOND AND FREE. 



Head downward, brutelike, pent in selfish ways 
Who wanders stumbling, shall decry at best 
The vision shattered, meaningless, confused: 
Kosmos, for him, to Chaos turned again. 
And ever as the pathway onward runs 
The life and color vanish from the scene. 
If he had comrades, mute they slip away 
Into the shadow as the twilight nears. 
Companionless and dreaded is the dusk: 
Grimmer and closer steals the spectre pale. 

But he who seeks and holds the bench assigned, 
Although it be the lowest, straightway feels 
His straining muscles keep harmonious time 
To the great pulse that bears the galley on. 
His foamswept porthole rims a glorious world. 
With every passing hour the vision clears, 
A simpler meaning linking all to each. 
Sped by his stroke with those who toil beside 
Triumphant fares the great ship past the shores 
Of time, upon the path to wider ways. 
Perchance, in happiest hours, he wins a glimpse 
Of that unmeasured curve whereon we sweep 
Through countless a3ons toward the goal undreamed.

MR. MURRAY'S BYRON.* 

It is now many years since Matthew Arnold, 
speaking of Wordsworth and of Byron, made 
his somewhat bold prophecy : " When the year 
1900 is turned, and our nation comes to recount 
her poetic glories in the century which has then 
just ended, the first names with her will be 
these." This was said at a time when some- 
thing was still to be expected from Tennyson 
and Browning and Lowell, and when Kipling 
was but a boy of sixteen. We are now very 
near the date referred to, and already the 
achievements of the nineteenth century seem 
to recede in rapidly diminishing perspective. 
Partly, doubtless, owing to the influence of Ar- 
nold himself, English (or Anglo-American) 
criticism is less provincial than formerly, and 
consequently saner and less intolerant. Byron 
is coming to hold some such place in our esti- 
mate as he has long held in the estimate of the 
" Amphictyonic Council of European opinion " 
which Arnold used to appeal to. He is no longer 
without honor even in his own country. It 
seems a piece of justice which may fitly be called 
poetic, that now, in the closing year of the cen- 
tury, a John Murray in Albemarle Street 
should be engaged in the publication, on the 
most generous scale, of the complete works of 
Lord Byron. 

Nearly two years ago I spoke in these" col- 
umnsf of Mr. W. E. Henley's interesting first 
volume of an edition of Byron. Inasmuch as no 
second volume has been issued, it may be pre- 
sumed that the project has been dropped. Con- 
sidering the greater completeness and attract- 
iveness of Mr. Murray's edition, the withdrawal 
of Mr. Henley from the field is on the whole not 
greatly to be regretted. Could he be prevailed 
upon to utilize his materials in another way, 
and to devote his great talents to the writing 
of a definitive biography of Byron, including 
a critical survey of the work and an estimate 
of the genius of the poet, Mr. Henley would 
be doing us a greater service than by persisting 
in the production of an edition which must inev- 
itably take a secondary place. It appears that 



*THB WORKS OF LORD BYRON. A New, lie vised, and 
Enlarged Edition. With illustrations. Letters and Journals : 
Volumes I. and II. Edited by Rowland E. Prothero, M.A., 
formerly Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. Poetry : Vol- 
ume I. Edited by Ernest Hartley Coleridge, M. A. London:

ner's Sons. 

I See THE DIAL, September 1, 1897. 



Mr. Murray has at command great masses of 
unpublished Byron manuscripts which are be- 
ing utilized for the present edition. Thus, 
while Mr. Henley's volume contains 231 letters, 
Mr. Murray's two volumes, covering the same 
period, contain 379. The text varies consid- 
erably in detail, and there are some passages 
omitted by Henley and restored in the present 
edition. It is to be presumed that these pas- 
sages, which often contain some freedom of ex- 

o 

pression, are restored from originals to which 
Mr. Henley was denied access ; but one is puz- 
zled to find some such free expressions in Hen- 
ley's text which are omitted in Murray's. There 
are two instances of this in the letter to Drury 
of June 25, 1809. 

Mr. Prothero, the editor of the " Letters and 
Journals," informs us that a bundle of letters 
from Byron's father " still exists, to attest, with 
startling plainness of speech, the strength of 
the tendencies which John Byron transmitted 
to his son." The only passage containing an 
allusion to the child is printed here ; but why 
not print them all ? It would be absurd to sup- 
press them at this time of day on account of 
their " startling plainness of speech." In an 
age when even novelists deem it necessary to 
invent pedigrees for their heroes, the suppres- 
sion of a " human document " of such interest 
as these letters is a sheer anachronism. Noth- 
ing that advances our knowledge of man should 
be withheld. Moreover, in the present instance 
the suppression is a wrong to the poet's mem- 
ory, which would surely be held in greater 
honor could we know more about " his birth's 
invidious bar." They would form quite as ap- 
propriate an appendix as do the letters of Ber- 
nard Barton or of Lady Caroline Lamb. 

For Mr. Prothero's editing of the Letters I 
have little but praise. He is vigilant, judicious, 
and barring a few minor slips accurate. 
His notes are not masterpieces of characteriza- 
tion like many of Mr. Henley's, nor have they 
the defects incident to the latter's lively tem- 
per and positive opinions. Mr. Prothero's notes 
are very full perhaps as full as Mr. Hen- 
ley's : they are never obtrusive or impertinent, 
and they often contain information not supplied 
by the earlier editor. Most of the notes are 
biographical ; no one is mentioned in the let- 
ters about whom something is not told us. The 
same is true of Mr. Coleridge's edition of the 
early poems. These notes will make this edi- 
tion a mine of information concerning Byron's 
friends and contemporaries. Sometimes infor- 
mation given by Mr. Prothero is repeated by 



1899.]

Mr. Coleridge, and there is no system of cross- 
references to notes on the same subject. Thus, 
in Volume II. of the " Letters and Journals " 
there is a long note, beginning at page 314, on 
Monk Lewis. At page 356 there is a short 
note concerning him ; and at page 317 of the 
Poems Mr. Coleridge gives another biography 
of Lewis, apropos of the reference to him in 
" English Bards and Scotch Reviewers." -We 
can only trust that it is the intention of the 
editors to enable the reader to coordinate all 
these notes by means of an index at the end of 
the whole work ; but even with an index a sys- 
tem of cross-references is a time-saver, partic- 
ularly in a work like this of many volumes. Of 
Mr. Coleridge's work I will only say that it 
seems to be well done, although his scrupulos- 
ity in giving variant readings for the " Hours 
of Idleness " seems a bit pedantic. Variant 
readings to poems that are themselves of no 
human interest, except as having been written 
by a great poet in the nonage of his muse, might 
surely be dispensed with. If the dulness of the 
verse is mortal, these variants give us " super- 
fluous death." Encouraged by such a fatal 
example, some candidate for University honors 
may any day present us with an apparatus crit- 
icus to the " Poems of Two Brothers," or a 
variorum edition of " Original Poetry by Victor 
and Cazire " ! 

In the Preface to the Letters, Mr. Prothero 
sets forth three special grounds on which they 
appeal " to all lovers of English literature." 
" They offer," he asserts, " the most suggestive 
commentary on his poetry ; they give the truest 
portrait of the man ; they possess, at their best, 
in their ease, freshness, and racy vigor, a very 
high literary value." Every one of these asser- 
tions may be true, but I, for one, cannot accept 
them without question. Perhaps a brief exam- 
ination of them here may be at least suggestive. 
Let us select one or two passages which are 
good samples of what we find by way of com- 
mentary on the poems. Byron writes laconic- 
ally to Murray under date of September, 1813 : 

" Dear Sir, Pray suspend the proofs for I am bit- 
ten again and have quantities for other parts of The 
Giaour." 

Again in November to Moore, with reference 
this time to " The Bride of Abydos ": 

"All convulsions end with me in rhyme; and to sol- 
ace my midnights, I have scribbled another Turkish 
story not a Fragment which you will receive soon 
after this. It does not trench upon your kingdom in 
the least, and if it did, you would soon reduce me to 
my proper boundaries. You will think, and justly, that 
I run some risk of losing the little I have gained in 
fame, by this further experiment on public patience; 



but I have really ceased to care on that head. I have 
written this and published it, for the sake of the em- 
ployment, to wring my thoughts from reality, and 
take refuge in ' imaginings,' however ' horrible ' ; and as 
to success ! those who succeed will console me for a 
failure excepting yourself and one or two more, 
whom luckily I love too well to wish one leaf of their 
laurels a tint yellower. This is the work of a week, 
and will be the reading of an hour to you, or even less, 
and so let it go . . ." 

The curious interest of many passages of 
which these are favorable examples is undeni- 
able. If merely these two were from the hand 
of Sophocles or of Shakespeare and had rela- 
tion to works of theirs, a certain number of inter- 
esting inferences might be drawn from them. 
They are sufficient to show that the author is 
probably on good terms with his publisher and 
with one or two rival poets ; that he writes rap- 
idly and is apt to be seized, at inconvenient 
moments, with the impulse to make additions 
and alterations ; that he puts, or affects to put, 
a modest estimate upon what he writes, and is 
willing to be thought to have " ceased to care " 
for fame ; that there is something in his life 
which he does not enjoy thinking about and so 
writes to solace his midnights ; these infer- 
ences might fairly be drawn, and in default of 
other evidence many others would doubtless be 
made, and would have more or less weight ac- 
cording to one's faith in the truthfulness of the 
writer. Inferences like these, when abundantly 
supported by external evidence, are doubtless 
contributions to biographical knowledge, and 
so to our knowledge of man. But in what im- 
portant respect do they supply a commentary 
upon the poems in question ? Do we appre- 
ciate the " Giaour " or the " Bride " one whit 
the better for knowing these things, or from 
knowing that the author chose to assert them ? 
Does not the poetry of Byron find its best com- 
mentary in the events and the conditions of the 
time in which he lived ? Is not the character 
of its author writ large upon every page of it ? 
Are not the self-revelations Byron gives us in 
his poetry incomparably deeper and truer than 
those given by the Letters ? 

This is of course not the place for anything 
like a satisfactory examination of such ques- 
tions as these. In going over the Letters once 
more, they have presented themselves to me 
more and more obstinately. Not that I would 
for a moment deny the very great interest of 
the Letters ; but who can fail to see that, in 
comparison with the poetry, the Letters are 
superficial and external ? Still, the true Byron 
is here, there can be no doubt of it ; and the 
true Byron none the less that he is often un-

true to his better self. Here are Byron's flip- 
pant wit, his impatience, his rebellious temper, 
his foible of taking his role at times for reality, 

of forgetting himself at moments in the part 
he fancies he plays. Tangled in with this com- 
plex skein we descry traits of penetrating 
insight, of English moderation and good sense, 
of delicate generosity, of self-forgetful friend- 
liness. In order to perceive all this, one must 
have some faith in the man and not be so hasty 
as to mistake a passing cloud for the sun's 
eclipse. In order to know Byron for the manly 
fellow he is, one must have the tact to take him 
off his guard. The moment he fancies the eye 

% of the world fixed curiously upon him, he be- 
comes self-conscious ; and what follows is too 
apt to be something for which there is no one 
sufficient English word, but which the French 
expressively term grimace. The sad miscon- 
ception that some have fallen into, that Byron 
is a hollow personage one chiefly histrionic 

may be partly due to unsympathetic and 
undiscriminatiug reading of his Letters and 
Journals. The quite external things they re- 
cord need to be related by the reader to other 
things that are not recorded, to a thousand 
causes that are not disclosed to the casual or 
impatient reader. In brief, an exercise of 
imagination is required in order to create the 
true, deep, living Byron from the data furnished 
by the Betters. Letters, journals, anecdotes, 
show him as he looked, not altogether as he 
was. They show Byron in two dimensions ; 
an effort of creative imagination may body him 
forth in three dimensions. 

To claim " a very high literary value " for 
these Letters implies the ascription to them of 
qualities by virtue of which they would retain 
an interest quite independent of their author- 
ship. In the time of Madame de Sevigne, letter- 
writing was a branch of fine art, and her letters 
belong to literature as undeniably as do the 
" Characters " of La Bruyere. Madame de 
Sevigne is at her best in her letters ; Byron is, 
in a literary sense, pretty nearly at his worst in 
his. He dashed them off at the last moment be- 
fore going to bed in the small hours, and they 
commonly show the low spirits of a man jaded 
with pleasure, bored by society, or exhausted by 
production. " I am dull and drowsy, as usual. 
I do nothing, and even that nothing fatigues 
me." Confidences like these would be worse 
than tedious coming from a person otherwise 
unknown. Such things are the mere expression 
of the momentary mood, or even excuses for 
slap-dash brevity. Byron seldom takes pleas- 



ure in writing a letter, but writes the necessary 
things in the tersest terms. His letters to Mur- 
ray often have the ring of a skipper giving 
orders in the teeth of a gale. Not that he is 
morose, but dead tired : one fairly sees him 
fling pen on table and himself into bed. When 
he chances to be in high spirits, as he occasion- 
ally is, he lets himself run on in an amusing if 
not always a becoming style. The anecdotage 
of the Letters strikes one as not especially 
tasteful ; and the philosophy is that of one who 
says in his haste that all men are liars, and 
other things almost as bad ! The letters writ- 
ten during his travels in the East are for the 
most part extremely summary, not to say per- 
functory. There is absolutely nothing of that 
loving and lingering description which delights 
us in the letters written from Italy by Shelley 
just ten years later. There are, indeed, two 
long letters of Byron to his mother, one from 
Gibraltar giving some account of his adven- 
tures with the women of Spain ; another de- 
scribing his visit to Ali Pacha. To judge from 
the Letters, the incident of his travels to which 
he attached the greatest importance was his 
exploit of swimming the Hellespont, which he 
refers to in at least ten different letters. It is 
obvious that he was reserving all his art for 
" Childe Harold," which is the real diary of his 
voyage, and to which the Letters furnish but a 
lean commentary. 

The volumes before us contain only the 
Letters down to the end of 1813, when Byron 
had not yet completed his twenty-fifth year. 
Those that are to come will be in most respects 
more interesting, and the great numbers of 
unpublished ones are looked forward to with 
some curiosity. When this beautiful edition is 
once completed, we shall be for the first time 
in a position to form something like a true 
image of what the man Byron really was. By 
that time, too, it is to be hoped, a truer esti- 
mate of Byron the poet will prevail. Re-read 
to-day, his poetry seems singularly fresh, 
partly, doubtless, by reason of the fashionable 
neglect of it. That it has some saving quali- 
ties, I believe : but this is a large subject which 
must be reserved for a later article.

THE WRITINGS or PRESIDENT MONROE.* 

Historically, the new interest that has sprung 
up in the writings of our early statesmen is a 
most encouraging feature of our intellectual 
life. Politically, we do not feel so confident. 
It is indeed difficult to judge in such matters ; 
but we cannot lay aside the belief that the new 
interest belongs much more to students, teach- 
ers, and writers of history, than to our politi- 
cians and statesmen. Still, if this is the case 
it does not follow that the new interest will 
not touch and influence politics ; for the work 
of the scholars and writers, through their 
own writings and the men that they send out 
from the colleges and universities, is sure to 
enter more or less into the circles of political 
life. 

The list of splendid editions of the works of 
early American statesmen that the Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons have brought out within 
the last few years, beginning with Alexander 
Hamilton and closing for the time with James 
Monroe, has immediately prompted the forego- 
ing remarks. Some of these editions have been 
second or third ones, although generally or 
always more complete than the earlier editions ; 
others are wholly new. This is the case with 
this last candidate for the public favor : no 
collection of the writings of Monroe until now 
had ever apppeared. In view of his long and 
successful career of more than fifty years, this 
seems not a little strange. Monroe was a gal- 
lant soldier in the Revolution ; served in the 
legislature and executive council of Virginia ; 
sat in the Old Congress and in the National 
Senate ; was twice governor of his native state ; 
represented his country in France, Spain, and 
England ; was a prominent member of Presi- 
dent Madison's cabinet ; was twice president 
himself, and finally retired from the public 
view as he laid down the presidency of the con- 
vention which sat in 1829-30 to revise the 
constitution of Virginia. And yet, as Presi- 
dent Oilman said in the introduction to his 
useful biography : 

" No adequate memoir of his life has been written; 
and while the papers of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, 
and Madison his four predecessors in the office of 
president have been collected and printed in a con- 
venient form, the student of Monroe's career must 
search for the data in numerous public documents and 
in the unassorted files of unpublished correspondence." 

* THE WHITINGS OF JAMES MONROE. Including a collec- 
tion of his public and private papers and correspondence, now 
for the first time printed. Edited by Stanislas Murray Ham- 
ilton. Volumes I. and II., 1778-1796. New York : G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. 



We offer no explanation of this strange fact, 
although we shall presently state a circumstance 
that may suggest a part of the explanation. 
But now the reproach, whatever the cause may 
have been, is about to be removed ; we have 
the first two volumes of an edition of Monroe 
that promises to be all that our historical schol- 
ars and public men could reasonably expect. 
The materials to draw upon, the editor thus 
describes : 

" Monroe has left material in the shape of notes, 
together with a large collection of letters from and to 
the most distinguished men of this and other countries. 
In the early period, while in congress, his correspond- 
ence with Jefferson and Madison is the most conspicu- 
ous. With both, for nearly the whole of his life, he 
maintained relations of great confidential intercourse, 
and was closely connected with them in many important 
official trusts. Such intercourse led to a constant inter- 
change of intelligence, opinions, and views, resulting in 
an immense mass of correspondence and documentary 
history. That which marks the period of the War of 
1812 is of great importance in exhibiting the untiring 
zeal and patriotism that lightened the public councils 
of the nation during that gloomy period. The letters 
written during his missions to France, Spain, and En- 
gland, contain instructive lessons to students in Amer- 
ican diplomacy." 

Of the places where these materials are found, 
he tells us : 

" The greater part of this collection was acquired by 
Congress from Monroe's heirs, under an appropriation 
of $20,000 by Act approved March 3, 1849. These 
manuscripts are now deposited in the Bureau of Rolls 
and Library of the Department of State, handsomely 
mounted and bound and calendared ; others are in our 
greater libraries and familiar archives, and many yet 
remain in the hands of individual owners. From the 
greater collection this edition is substantially drawn; 
but generous and cordial responses from other sources 
have enabled me to include many of the scattered 
papers." 

The first volume consists mainly of letters. 
The series opens with one to Washington dated 
June 28, 1778, and closes with one to Jefferson, 
June 6, 1794, dates which will suggest to the 
reader that the series does not cover the most 
important events of Monroe's life. And yet 
many interesting transactions are included 
within these two dates. We may mention in 
particular the adoption of the Federal Consti- 
tution. Monroe was a member of the Virginia 
convention that ratified the Constitution, and, 
as is well known, took the wrong side ; but this 
he did in a manner thoroughly consonant with 
the general tenor of his mind and life, that 
is, with moderation. The letters that deal with 
these matters, especially those to Jefferson, 
while they perhaps do not yield new light, are 
nevertheless interesting reading. Writing to 
Jefferson, then in Paris, April 10, 1788, Mon-

THE DIAL,

roe sums up the situation as he sees it at the 
time, with these words : 

" The event of this business is altogether incertain, as 
to its passage thro the Union. That it will nowhere be 
rejected admits of little doubt. And that it will ulti- 
mately, perhaps in 2 or three years terminate in some 
wise and happy establishment for our country, is what 
we have good reason to expect." 

On July 12 of the same year, after the Vir- 
ginia ratification, he explains to the same cor- 
respondent that it is really a conditional ratifi- 
cation, and offers some remarks upon the course 
pursued throughout by Washington : 

" The conduct of Genl. Washington upon this occasion 
has no doubt been right and meritorious. All parties 
had acknowledged defects in the federal system, and 
been sensible of the propriety of some material change. 
To forsake the honorable retreat to which he had retir'd, 
& risque the reputation he had so deservedly acquired, 
manifested a zeal for the public interest, that could after 
so many and illustrious services, & at this stage of his 
life, scarcely have been expected from him. Having, 
however, commenc'd again on the publick theatre, the 
course which he takes becomes not only highly inter- 
esting to him but likewise so to us : the human character 
is not perfect; if he partakes of those qualities which 
we have too much reason to believe are almost insep- 
arable from the frail nature of our being, the people of 
America will perhaps be lost. Be assured his influence 
carried this government; for my own part I have a 
boundless confidence in him, nor have I any reason to 
believe he will ever furnish occasion for withdrawing it. 
More is to be apprehended if he takes a part in the pub- 
lic councils again, as he advances in age, from the de- 
signs of those around him than from any disposition of 
his own." 

The two appendices, together making some 
ninety pages, contain the two forms of a pam- 
phlet on the Constitution that Monroe laid be- 
fore his constituents on the eve of the Virginia 
convention, the first one of which, however, 
was never published. 

Volume II., consisting also of correspond- 
ence, covers the three years 1794-5-6. Events 
now move much more rapidly than before ; for 
Monroe is the minister plenipotentiary of his 
country in Paris, which is seething with all the 
interests and passions of the Revolution. The 
first letter is from Randolph to Monroe, con- 
veying Washington's instructions ; the last one, 
from Monroe to Pickering, Secretary of State, 
just before the minister's recall from the em- 
bassy. The threatening relations of the two 
republics are all the time at the front, but other 
important questions as Jay's Treaty, and the 
negotiations with the Barbary States and Spain 
are not far in the background. The letters 
are nearly all addressed to the Secretary of State 
and Washington, the French Committee of Pub- 
lic Safety and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mad- 



ison and Jefferson. Notes are more frequent 
than in the previous volume. The editor will 
find a provoking blunder in the " Contents ": the 
letters to Madison and the Secretary of State 
have changed places (pp. 456, 460). The value 
of both volumes is enhanced by " annals " of 
Monroe's life, which materially assist the reader 
in keeping track of contemporary events. 

The place that President Monroe will hold in 
history is already settled, at least so far as his 
general classification is concerned. Particular 
facts in his life may become more significant or 
less significant as time goes on ; these Writings 
will more fully illuminate his public career ; 
but nothing can occur that will advance him to 
the first rank among our statesmen, or relegate 
him to the third rank. In this sense he is a 
second-rate man, standing well up in his class. 
This is the circumstance referred to above as 
possibly tending to explain why his works have 
never before been published. To us, the most 
interesting feature in his long and useful life is 
his thorough comprehension of the problem of 
the territorial integrity of the Nation, what it 
involved, and the policies by which it must be 
maintained. One interesting instance or proof 
of this comprehension is covered by the open- 
ing volume : namely, his opposition, in common 
with Southern men generally, to any surrender 
or yielding of our rights on the Mississippi, at 
the time of Jay's unsuccessful negotiations with 
Gardoqui. The remarks that we had intended 
to offer on this interesting topic, however, may 
well be held in reserve until the progress of the 
publication brings further evidence of the same 
comprehension before us. B. A. HINSDALE. 



ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE MODERN PLAY.* 

Some people like to read plays, but on the 
whole, in this country at least, they are in a 
minority. There are not nearly so many peo- 
ple who enjoy reading a play they have not seen, 
as enjoy reading a novel. This is in some re- 
spects a little singular. We may remember 
how stupid Alice thought her sister's book be- 
cause it had no conversations. Now, a play is 
all conversation. We shall remember too, prob- 
ably, if we try to think, that most people dislike 
in novels and therefore skip descriptions, 
whether studies of scenery or analyses of char-

aeter. A play leaves character and scenery, 
when you read it, largely to the tender mercies 
of our imagination. In fact, a play has a great 
deal that we like in a novel, and it does not 
have a good deal that we do not like. Why, 
then, should not people like to read plays? 

One thing that may have something to do 
with the matter is that the drama is not, in 
America, an entirely recognized branch of lit- 
erature, or rather of contemporary literature. 
Say what we will of what ought to be, the fact 
is that it is not, taking the general conception 
of literature which commonly obtains. When 
we think of current literature, we think of 
novels, poems, essays, histories, but not of plays. 
This may be a cause or an effect of people's not 
reading plays ; it would take too long to deter- 
mine which. 

Abroad, the drama is far more a recognized 
branch of literature. In America there are 
certainly several novelists and poets who have 
now and then cast their .work in dramatic form, 
but as a rule it is merely for their own amuse- 
ment, or as an experiment, or as a wholly minor 
matter. Nor do these dramatic pieces see the 
stage except in private. On the other hand, 
our dramatists do not publish their plays : they 
write for the stage, and not for book form. 
Thus, although we may hear that " Secret Ser- 
vice " or " Nathan Hale " has " literary quality," 
or "is literature," or something of the sort, yet 
there is no good way of knowing anything 
about it. 

To some degree, the matter is different in 
England. There, two of the popular play- 
wrights, Mr. Pinero and Mr. Jones, publish 
their plays ; and so do two of the non-popular, 
Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. Davidson. Still, 
even in England the matter does not go quite as 
far as it does on the Continent. In Germany 
and France, in Norway and Belgium, we have 
the spectacle, curious to us, of men of letters 
of commanding reputations both at home and 
abroad being dramatists, and generally dram- 
atists successful on the stage. Hence there is 
more point in translating foreign plays than 
there would be in translating English plays. 
English and American plays are not as a rule 
significant of anything except the popular taste ; 
Continental plays often are. Ibsen, Maeter- 
linck, Rostand, Sudermann, Hauptmann, these 
are representative names, as representative 
almost as any in contemporary letters that could 
be found. 

Thus, although we may not think of it at 
once, a series like " Modern Plays," of which 



the first three volumes are before us, offers us 
something which we may well be really glad to 
have. Plays have been as a rule less translated 
than novels. We can, it is true, read almost 
all of Ibsen or Maeterlinck in English, but we 
can read only a play or two of Hauptmann, 
Sudermann, Rostand, and generally nothing at 
all by many lesser men whose work yet has a 
good deal of interest. The plays chosen for 
translation in this series have a good deal of 
interest : there are also a number of interesting 
plays which are not so far announced. Thus, 
it is good to have something by Villiers de 
1'Isle Adam, and of Emile Verhaeren, espe- 
cially if one likes to read Maeterlinck : we get 
thereby a better idea of the tendencies of dra- 
matic writing. But I cannot see why we have 
nothing in the list by the German dramatists ; 
even if the work of the strongest men is to 
appear elsewhere, there are other plays, like 
Ernst Rosmer's "Konigskinder " or Fulda's 
"Talisman," to show that there are dramatists 
in Germany as well as in Belgium or Norway 
or Russia. 

But to turn to the plays that are translated, 
instead of carping about those that are not. 
Of the three volumes issued, "The Storm," by 
Ostrovsky, is probably the greatest stranger to 
all not especially acquainted with Russian lit- 
erature. It is a modern play in the same sense 
in which we might call " La Dame aux Game- 
lias" modern; it was written about the same 
time. But of course mere chronology does not 
settle such a matter : we think of " The Ordeal 
of Richard Feverel" as being "modern" in a 
sense in which " David Copperfield " and " Pen- 
dennis " are not, although the three come in the 
same decade. Still, I rather think that " The 
Storm" is of about the same generation as 
"Fathers and Sons" or "War and Peace," 
which means that, however good in itself, it is 
hardly significant of contemporary thought. 

Good in itself the play is. Realism has lost 
a little of its fascination for us, partly through 
self - consciousness and its consequences. A 
realist nowadays can hardly help being self- 
conscious, can he? Mr. Gissing shows genius in 
not being so. Ostrovsky wrote before realism 
was fashionable, and it is therefore refreshing 
to read his play. Something has been said as 
to its value in psychology and its reflecting the 
life of Russia. On the whole, so far as those 
matters are concerned, I should be more inter- 
ested in the work of a psychologist, or of a 
traveller, say. In reading a play, I like it to 
be chiefly a play. This " The Storm " is, what-

ever else, although, as Miss Garnett remarks, 
it is delightfully untheatrical. 

" The Dawn," by Emile Verhaeren, I am not 
inclined to value very highly. There are un- 
doubtedly some rather stirring things about its 
method, for instance, the curious handling of 
the Groups which " act as a single person of 
multiple and contradictory aspects." There are 
other things, too ; but if you ask for more than 
method, I think you will find the play strangely 
vague and illusory. It is a curious thing that 
when writers are dealing with Revolution they 
prefer to deal in sounding generalities. It was 
so in "The Revolt of Islam," in "The Tragic 
Comedians," in "The Princess Casamassima." 
You hear of wonderful things, but you get small 
idea of what these things really are. Something 
of this difficulty exists in " The Dawn." Now in 
real life when we get a leader of the people who 
deals only with phrases we call him a demagogue. 
I am not able to offer evidence that Jacques 
Herenien was a greater man than Cleon or 
Dennis Kearney, although I think that was 
M. Verhaeren's idea. 

The "Three Plays" of Maeterlinck have 
been translated before ; indeed, two of them in 
this volume are reprinted. They are, however, 
excellent plays to have in the series, for they 
are very characteristic. "Alladine and Palo- 
mides" is representative of a romantic class 
consisting otherwise of "Pelleas and Meli- 
sande " and " Aglavaine and Selysette." " In- 
terior " represents the realistic class to which 
belong "The Intruder" and "The Blind." 
"The Death of Tintagiles" hardly represents 
any class, although there is a good deal in it 
that reminds one of the fourth act of " The 
Princess Maleine." Still, I always think of the 
play by itself : I think it has always been my 
favorite. The romantic plays I cannot persuade 
myself to care for, except in a literary way. 
The realistic plays I certainly do like, in spite 
of their symbolism. It might seem that a play 
which, like "The Death of Tintagiles," com- 
bined the drawbacks of both, would be less 
agreeable than either. On the contrary, as I 
have said, I like it better than the others, pos- 
sibly because it is more purely characteristic 
of its author. 

" Modern Plays " then, are so far interesting; 
and from the announcements it would seem that 
the rest would be so. One thing at least may 
be said : Here are plays that you can probably 
never see on the stage ; if you want to know 
about them you will have to trust to the books.

RTJSKIN, ROSSETTI, PR^RAPHAELITISM.* 

The publication of private correspondence 
should have its reason not merely in the fact 
that the writers were persons of distinction, but 
also in some intrinsic charm of the letters, or 
in their relation to particular time, influence, 
or social conditions. To students of the En- 
glish romantic movement, the volume " Ruskin, 
Rossetti, Prseraphaelitism " a collection of 
letters and other papers, edited by Mr. W. M. 
Rossetti cannot fail to be of interest, but 
even they will hardly claim for its publication 
such ideal apology. The names are distin- 
guished indeed, but there is no special grace 
of writing, and the matter with certain nota- 
ble exceptions, which constitute about a fourth 
of the volume is either purely personal or of 
small importance, while the connection, even of 
the excepted fourth, with Prasraphaelite prin- 
ciples and history is but slightly apparent save 
to those already familiar and concerned with 
them. It is for such, perhaps, that the book is 
intended ; certainly they will be its close read- 
ers, and they will probably find in the more im- 
portant passages an excuse, at least, for the 
publication of the whole. 

The papers which include, besides letters, 
a few miscellaneous items, and fragments from 
the diaries of Madox Brown and W. M. Ros- 
setti belong to the period between 1854 and 
1862. Among the most interesting as one 
who knows his Ruskin might expect are Rus- 
kin's letters to Rossetti, which suggest keenly 
the writer's character and beliefs. Their criti- 
cism is, as a rule, concerned with Rossetti's own 
work, but once or twice becomes quite general 
in application. In a letter of 1854 with 
regard to some ordered sketches the critic 
preaches thus to the young painter : 

" Now about myself and your drawings. I am not more 
sure of anything in this world (and I am very positive 
about a great many things) than that the utmost a man 
can do is that which he can do without effort. All beau- 
tiful work singing, painting, dancing, speaking is 
the easy result of long and painful practice. Immedi- 
ate effort always leads to shrieking, blotching, postur- 
ing, mouthing. If you send me a picture in which you 
try to do your best, you may depend upon it it will be 
beneath your proper mark of power, and will disappoint 
me. If you make a careless couple of sketches, with 
bright and full colour in them, you are sure to do what 
will please me. ... I don't say this in the slightest de- 
gree out of delicacy, to keep you from giving me too 
much time. If I really liked the laboured sketch better, 
I would take it at once. I tell you the plain truth

and I always said the same to Turner ' If you will do 
me a drawing in three days, I shall be obliged to you ; 
but if you take three months to do it, you may put it 
behind the fire when it is done.' And I should have said 
precisely the same thing to Tintoret or any other very 
great man. I don't mean to say you oughtn't to do the 
hard work. But the laboured picture will always be in 
part an exercise not a result. You oughtn't to do many 
careless or slight works, but you ought to do them some- 
times ; and, depend upon it, the whole cream of you will 
be in them." 

Equally in character are Raskin's scattered bits 
of technical criticism, whether on matters ar- 
tistic or matters literary ; for example, his plea, 
after reading some of Rossetti's translations 
from the Italian, " for entire clearness of mod- 
ern and unantiquated expression"; or, again, 
the following bit of advice in a letter to Miss 
Siddal regarding the use of color : 

" Work as much as possible in colour. I do not care 
whether they be separate drawings or illuminations, but 
try always to sketch with colour rather than with pen- 
cil only I mean so far as is agreeable to you. The 
slightest blot of blue or green is pleasanter to me than 
a whole month's work with chalk or ink." 

Whatever it may have been at a later time, 
Ruskin's attitude toward Rossetti is here one 
of extreme friendliness and admiration, 
proved by a delicate liberality, not only to Ros- 
setti himself, but also to Miss Siddal, to whom 
the painter was then affianced. In an early 
letter one almost too intimate to be quoted 

he puts his buying in a way which is at once 
airy and earnest. He says : 

" Thus then it stands. It seems to me that, amongst 
all the painters I know, you on the whole have the 
greatest genius, and you appear to me also to be as far 
as I can make out a very good sort of person. I see 
that you are unhappy and that you can 't bring out your 
genius as you should. It seems to me then the proper 
and necessary thing, if I can, to make you more happy, 
and that I should be more really useful in enabling you 
to paint properly and keep your room in order than in 
any other way." 

Of the letters written by Rossetti, only two 
are of special importance, the others, indeed, 
giving occasional glimpses of his character, but 
revealing nothing more than has been revealed 
in correspondence heretofore published. These 
two addressed to Mr. Charles Eliot Norton 

contain news which takes us back into the 
very midst of a group of ardent young roman- 
ticists. The first dated July, 1858 gives 
an account of the tempora painting, now per- 
ished, in the Union Debating Hall at Oxford. 
It is difficult to select passages for quotation, 
but the following will perhaps be most sug- 
gestive : 

" I may now go on to tell you something about the 
Oxford pictures. I dare say that you know that the 



building is one by Woodward the Debating Room of 
the Union Society. Its beauty and simple character 
seemed to make it a delightful receptacle for wall paint- 
ings, and accordingly a few of us thought we would 
decorate it, as an experiment in a style to which I, 
for one, should like to devote the whole of my time 
better than to any other branch of art. With the ex- 
ception of Arthur Hughes and myself, those engaged 
upon it have made there almost their debut as paint- 
ers; they are Edward Jones, W. Morris (of whom 
you saw some stories in the O(xford) and C(ambridge) 
Mag(azine), and who, I think, must have sent you 
his volume of poems, Spencer Stanhope, Pollen, and 
V. C. Prinsep. Jones's picture is a perfect masterpiece, 
as is all he does. His subject in the series (which you 
know is from' the Mort Arthur) represents Merlin be- 
ing imprisoned beneath a stone by the Damsel of the 
Lake. 

" My own subject ... is Sir Launcelot prevented 
by his sin from entering the chapel of the San Grail. 
He has fallen asleep before the shrine full of angels, 
and between him and it rises, in his dream, Queen 
Guenevere, the cause of all. She stands gazing at him, 
with her arms extended in the branches of an apple-tree. 
As a companion to this I shall paint a design, which I 
have made for the purpose, of the attainment of the 
San Grail by Launcelot's son Galahad, together with 
Bors and Percival. . . . The works, you know, are all 
very large the figures considerably above life-size, 
though at their heighth from the ground they hardly 
look so. I trust, when the work is finished, you will 
see it some day. There is no work like it for delight- 
fulness in the doing, and none, I believe, in which one 
might hope to delight others more according to his 
powers." 

The second letter to Professor Norton 
written in January, 1862 tells of " the 
firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co., 
Art workmen," and encloses a prospectus. 
Burne-Jones is again mentioned, and this time 
with a prophecy which has long been ful- 
filled. Apropos of the new firm, Rossetti 
says : 

" Our commissions as yet are chiefly in stained glass, 
but I wish you could see a painted cabinet with the his- 
tory of St. George, and other furniture of great beauty 
which we have in hand. . . . Morris, and Webb the 
architect, are our most active men of business as regards 
the actual conduct of the concern ; the rest of us chiefly 
confine ourselves to contributing designs when called 
for, as of course the plan is to effect something worth 
doing by cooperation, but without the least interfering 
with the individual pursuits of those among us who are 
painters. A name perhaps new to you on our list 
but destined to be unsurpassed, perhaps unequalled, in 
fame by any name of this generation is Edward 
Burne-Jones. He is a painter still younger than most 
of us by a good deal, and who has not yet exhibited, 
except at some private places; but I cannot convey to 
you in words any idea of the exquisite beauty of all he 
does. To me no art I know is so delightful, except that 
of the best Venetians." 

Among the " miscellaneous items " is a no- 
tice, taken from "The Athenaeum," of the 
Praraphaelite Exhibition of 1857. In this,

Millais is spoken of as " the chief of the sect," 
Holman Hunt as " the apostle of the order," 
and Rossetti as " the original founder of the 
three-lettered race, who is generally spoken of 
by them in a low voice " and who " does not 
and will not exhibit in public." Praeraphaelit- 
ism is praised, however, in that " its errors, 
eccentricities, and wilful aberrations are fast 
softening and modifying." A few months later 
there was held in New York an exhibit of pic- 
tures by English artists, in which the Prse- 
raphaelites were largely represented and it 
is claimed by Mr. Stillman that their work was 
more fully appreciated in America than in 
England. Captain Ruxton, the manager of the 
exhibit, wrote : " P. R. Bism takes with the 
working men. They look, and they look, and 
they look, and they say something that the au- 
thor of the picture would be pleased to hear." 
I have indicated only the important matter 
of the volume. The poems by Miss Siddal are 
notable, but mainly so because of her early 
environment ; the letters from Robert Brown- 
ing are unimportant ; and the literary criticism, 
though extremely interesting, consists of mere 
fragments. As for reading from these papers 
either the Prasraphaelite doctrines or the char- 
acteristics of Rossetti's genius a genius which 
far transcended all that that early " ism " could 
suggest such reading is, as I have said, for 
those who know. They will mark (for example) 
a letter of Coventry Patmore's which affirms 
the symbolism of " The Passover," and one of 
Ruskiu's which denies it ; and they will recall 
Rossetti's beautiful sonnet for " The Passover," 
which begins 

" Here meet together the prefiguring day 
And day prefigured " 

a comment which, even if inspired by Patmore, 
points out the discerning critic. Such faint 
hints as to Rossetti's qualities occur quite 
often in the book, and the little poem " At 
Last " one of those mentioned is distinctly 
Praeraphaelite ; but as to the meaning, spirit, 
and ideals of Praeraphaelitisrn, there is nothing 
definite. The letters quoted, however, breathe 
something of the atmosphere of their time 
and herein lies their chief value. The illustra- 
tion of the book is in photogravure the pic- 
tures selected for this being, with a single 
exception, Rossetti's work. The exception, a 
picture by W. L. Windus, is one which Rossetti 
greatly admired, and which takes its subject 
from the naive and passionate old ballad of 
" Burd Helen."

MUSICAL, MATTERS, AND OTHERS.* 

The books which are grouped together for men- 
tion in this article are all concerned, wholly or in 
part, with musical history or aesthetics ; yet in two 
or three cases the contents are of so varied a nature 
that this commentary cannot avoid touching upon 
extra-musical matters, and the qualification of our 
title is thus accounted for. Before taking the books 
up one by one, we would like to call attention to 
the recent marked development, of which there is 
much more evidence than this list of books affords, 
of popular interest in musical subjects, of a better 
taste among listeners to music, and of a clearer 
comprehension of both the aims and the technique 
of the art. The number of people who can listen 
to a musical performance with intelligence and ap- 
preciative sympathy was never before in this coun- 
try so large as it is at present, and it is a fortunate 
thing that the popular literature of the subject should 
keep pace with the growth of interest. 

The book to which attention shall be called first 
of all is the collection of essays upon " Music and 
Poetry," which Mrs. Sidney Lanier has just brought 
together, partly from the periodicals of twenty and 
thirty years ago, partly from the manuscripts left 
by her husband at his death. It is well known that 
Lanier was a musician of no mean accomplishment, 
but it is not quite so well known although it migbt 
be inferred safely enough from his treatise upon 
English verse as well as from the volume of his own 
poems that he was a serious philosophical thinker

upon the art of music, its physical and psycholog- 
ical bases, and the secret of its deep appeal to the 
soul. That Lanier was this also, is made evident 
by the three essays which open the present volume, 
and which have for their titles " From Bacon to 
Beethoven," " The Orchestra of To-day," and " The 
Physics of Music." The first of these essays is the 
most important in the volume, and furnishes it with 
a key-note. The title embodies an antithesis which 
the author frames for the purpose of showing how 
very modern an art (as we understand it) music is, 
and which he hastens to illustrate by a quotation 
from the " Essays," in which " the wise fool Fran- 
cis" expresses his contempt for all "fiddling." 
Having asserted the claim of music to be considered 
the modern art par excellence, the author goes on 
to make it very clear that a musical composition has 
no power to tell a story, although it may heighten 
the effect of a story by association with it. " Per- 
haps the most effectual step a man can take in 
ridding himself of the clouds which darken most 
speculations upon these matters is to abandon imme- 
diately the idea that music is a species of language 
which is not true, and to substitute for that 
the converse idea that language is a species of music." 
He meant by this substantially what Pater meant 
when, in " The School of Giorgione," he said : "All 
art constantly aspires towards the condition of mu- 
sic. Music, then, and not poetry, as is so often 
supposed, is the true type or measure of perfected 
art." We believe this idea to be fundamental to 
all rational discussion of musical aesthetics. Yet 
Lanier does not go to the extreme of condemning 
" programme-music," but rather urges that, although 
we should not be misled by it into an unsound logic, 
we may very properly enjoy it for what it really does 
accomplish. " Certainly if programme-music is ab- 
surd, all songs are nonsense." Again, nothing could 
be more soundly or beautifully put than Lanier's 
claim that music is a moral agent. These sentences 
will illustrate the point of view : " Just as persist- 
ently as our thought seeks the Infinite, does our 
emotion seek the Infinite." "It cannot be that 
music has taken this place in the deepest and holiest 
matters of man's life through mere fortuitous ar- 
rangement." The other musical essays contained 
in this collection are less valuable than that hitherto 
under discussion, and one of them, " The Physics 
of Music," is devoted to some rather unworthy quib- 
bling over some contentions of Richard Grant White, 
who certainly knew more about the physical aspect 
of music than Lanier was willing to admit, although 
he never reached a true philosophy of the art. The 
literary essays are upon such subjects as Bartholo- 
mew Griffin, Chaucer, Shakespeare, John Barbour, 
Paul Hayne, and the use of nature-metaphors in 
poetry. They are all suggestive and worth reprint- 
ing, although rather fragmentary in their character. 
Mr. Krehbiel's volume of essays on " Music and 
Manners in the Classical Period " is devoted to five 
main subjects. The first two, " A Poet's Music " 
and " Haydn in London," are studies based upon 



manuscript volumes in the author's possession. The 
second of these titles explains itself ; the first relates 
to Thomas Gray, whose nine volumes of annotated 
transcriptions of music, made by the poet in Italy 
about 1740, contain examples of many forgotten 
composers and singers of the early eighteenth cen- 
tury. These two essays have a certain measure of 
curious historical interest, but little of any other 
kind. In "A Mozart Centenary," Mr. Krehbiel 
records his impressions of the Salzburg festival of 
1891. The account is agreeably readable, and is 
supplemented by a brief paper on " Da Ponte in 
New York." Da Ponte, it will be remembered, was 
the librettist of " Don Giovanni " and " Le Nozze." 
He came to New York in 1805, and died there in 
1838. His activity as a teacher of Italian and an 
interpreter of Dante in America has been discussed 
by Mr. T. W. Koch in his valuable work, " Dante 
in America," but it has remained for Mr. Krehbiel 
to write the story of his life, as far as it can be re- 
covered, and to settle some disputed points in its 
chronology. In " Beethoven and His Biographer," 
Mr. Krehbiel writes of the life of A. W. Thayer, 
with extracts from his note-books, and describes the 
Beethoven Museum at Bonn. The closing essay, 
entitled " Reflections at Weimar," brings into con- 
junction and comparison the two periods of Wei- 
mar's artistic efflorescence the period of Goethe 
and that of Liszt. 

Mr. W. J. Henderson's " critical and explanatory 
account of the growth of modern music ' ' is one of 
the most satisfactory books of its kind that we have 
ever read. It is, of course, an elementary sketch, 
being intended for the wider public that takes an 
interest in music without knowing much about it, 
but, within these limits, it is an exceptionally suc- 
cessful performance. If we were to make any gen- 
eral criticism upon its perspective, it would be that 
opera gets a disproportionate share of attention. The 
history is considered under three periods, the poly- 
phonic, the classic, and the romantic. The first " is 
chiefly notable for its intellectual characteristics. 
It displays immense mastery of the elementary ma- 
terials of music and an enormous profundity of 
thought in purely technical processes." In the sec- 
ond period " we find wonderful symmetry of form, 
a continual subordination of profound learning to a 
pleasing style, and a sweetness and serenity of the 
emotional atmosphere." In the third period, " one 
finds a constant struggle for the definite expression 
of the profoundest emotions of our nature. Its 
forms are flexible, its diction the richest attainable, 
and its conception of beauty based largely on its 
ideal of truth." Speaking generally of these periods, 
the author properly says : 

" In listening to the music of any composer, the hearer 
should take into account the general tendency, purpose, 
and scope of musical art of his period, and also the par- 
ticular aims of the composer. No one has a right to say 
that Mozart failed because he did not accomplish what 
Beethoven did. Mozart accomplished all that could be 
accomplished with the resources of musical art in his 



340

day, and he himself enormously enlarged those re- 
sources. That is the achievement of a genius. Every- 
one has a right to say that Donizetti and Bellini failed 
because they not only did not succeed in accomplishing 
all that it was possible to accomplish in opera in their 
time, but deliberately ignored the fundamental princi- 
ples of the art and also the immense advances in its 
technic made by Gluck and Mozart. Everyone must 
admit that Verdi has achieved the triumph of a great 
master in his ' Falstaff,' for he has utilized everything 
contributed to operatic art by its leading geniuses, old 
and new, and yet has produced an entirely original and 
independent work." 

Besides such general criticism as this, the sanity of 
which is obvious, Mr. Henderson naturally has occa- 
sion to enrich his history with much critical com- 
ment of the specific sort. With this we are gen- 
erally in agreement, although we should not he 
willing to say, for example, that " there is no depth, 
no sincerity, in the music of Rossini." There is 
not much, it is true ; but " William Tell " remains 
one of the immortal masterpieces of the lyric drama. 
On the other hand, we believe that Mr. Henderson 
strikes the true critical note in his treatment of the 
man who was until about a year ago the greatest of 
living composers. 

" Some time, I think, if not soon, the world will see 
how profoundly representative of his nation and his 
time Brahms was, and he will be hailed, as Milton was, 
an organ voice of his country. The irresistible serious- 
ness of Germany has never spoken with more convincing 
accent than in the music of Brahms. There is a feeling 
in this music which is far removed from the possibility 
of a purely sensuous embodiment." 

Another book by Mr. Henderson, the first in a 
new " Music Lover's Library," is entitled " The 
Orchestra and Orchestral Music." It may best be 
described in the author's own prefatory words, as 
" simply an attempt to give to music lovers such 
facts about the modern orchestra as will help them 
in assuming an intelligent attitude toward the con- 
temporaneous instrumental body and its perform- 
ances." Further, "the author has endeavored to 
put before the reader a description of each instru- 
ment, with an illustration which will enable him to 
identify its tone when next heard in the delivery of 
the passage quoted." Other chapters are devoted 
to the methods of scoring, historically considered, to 
the evolution of the conductor, and to the evolution 
of orchestral composition. The task attempted is 
no easy one, and Mr. Henderson has been perhaps 
as successful as was to be expected. Such a matter 
as the theory of transposing instruments is not easy 
of comprehension to the amateur. The writer does 
not seem always to have given his explanations in 
the simplest form possible. He gives a long account, 
with examples in notation, of the pitch of the string 
family of instruments. It would have been better 
to say outright that the viola is a fifth lower than 
the violin, and to describe the double-bass as tuned 
in fourths, exactly reversing the G D A E of the 
violin. But this is a minor matter. The book is 
mostly matter-of-fact in its statements, although now 



and then an anecdote or a bit of criticism comes in 
to enliven the treatise. Of the latter, this is an 
example : 

" A symphony of Mozart orchestrated in the Richard 
Strauss style would be a tinted Venus; while a tone 
poem of Strauss scored a la Mozart would be like one 
of Cropsey's autumn landscapes reduced to the dead 
level of a pen-and-ink drawing." 

By way of anecdote, the following is so good that it 
must be quoted : 

" A conductor once went from another city to Boston 
to conduct an orchestra at the first appearance in this 
country of an eminent pianist, whose piece de resistance 
was to be Liszt's E flat concerto. At the beginning of 
the scherzo there are some lightly tripping notes for the 
triangle, which the player struck too heavily to please 
the conductor's fancy. He rapped with his baton to stop 
the orchestra. 

" Sir,' he said, gravely, addressing the triangle player, 
'those notes should sound like a blue-bell struck by a 
fairy.' 

"Whereupon the whole body of instrumentalists burst 
into uncontrollable laughter. I told this story subse- 
quently to a New York musician, a member of Theodore 
Thomas's orchestra, and he looked so amazed that I said : 

" ' But does n't Mr. Thomas talk to you at rehearsal ? ' 

" ' Oh, yes! Oh, certainly! ' was the reply. 

" ' Well, what does he say ? ' 

"'He says D n!"'" 

The book is illustrated by many passages of music 
printed in notation, and with eight portraits of emi- 
nent conductors, from Haydn to Mr. Nikisch. 

Mr. James Huneker's " Mezzotints in Modern 
Music " have for their subjects Brahms, Tschai- 
kowsky, Chopin, R. Strauss, Liszt, and Wagner. 
There is also a chapter on the literature of Etudes 
for the piano. Indeed, Mr. Huneker's interest in 
the men of whom he writes is predominantly pian- 
istic, although his windows are frequently opened 
for a wider outlook. The chapter on Brahms is 
highly eulogistic, although not unreservedly so, yet 
the writer is not without high appreciation of Wag- 
ner. On the whole, however, he holds Brahms to 
have been the greater and the more enduring artist 
of the two. Mr. Huneker's style is too pretentious, 
but he often says striking things. Here is a passage 
concerning the closing movement of Tschaikowsky's 
" Pathetic " symphony in B minor : 

" Since the music of the march in the Eroica,' since 
the mighty funeral music in ' Siegfried,' there has been 
no such death music as this adagio lamentoso, this as- 
tounding torso, which Michel Angelo would have under- 
stood and Dante wept over. It is the very apotheosis of 
mortality, and its gloomy accents, poignant melody, and 
harmonic coloring make it one of the most impressive of 
contributions to mortuary music. It sings of the en- 
tombment of a nation, and is incomparably noble, dig- 
nified, and unspeakably tender. It is only at the close 
that the rustling of the basses conveys a sinister shud- 
der; the shudder of the Dies Irse when the heavens shall 
be a fiery scroll and the sublime trump sound its sum- 
mons to eternity." 

Such writing cannot be freed from the charge of 
extravagance, although the subject in this case 



1899.] 



THE DIAL 



341 



almost justifies it. But the writer strains for his 
literary effects too frequently and too much to pro- 
duce the best impression. In his reaction from the 
academic manner in criticism, he goes too far, like 
some of his English contemporaries, of whom we 
shall have a word to say a little later in this review. 

Mr. W. F. Apthorp's two small volumes entitled 
" By the Way " consist of short essays upon musical 
subjects originally written for the programme-books 
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra during five years 
of the writer's editorship of that publication. Al- 
though he has set himself about " furbishing them 
up a bit" for publication in book form, these essays 
remain essentially what they were when written 
musical journalism of a better than the usual sort, 
yet hardly literary productions in the more dignified 
sense. The process of furbishing should at least 
have expunged such colloquialisms as "from the 
word go " or that particularly vile phrase " a par- 
ticularly brainy composer." It should also have led 
the writer to look up his Moliere and avoid the error 
of saying " trombe marine " for " trompette marine." 
These essays are upon all sorts of subjects. A few 
taken at random are " Musical Slips," " The Influ- 
ence of Surroundings," " People Who Hate Music," 
" Some Points in Modern Orchestration," " Tschai- 
kowsky in Paris," and " Musical Reminiscences of 
Boston Thirty Years Ago." The last of these is 
one of a peculiarly interesting group anecdotal in 
character. We have heard, but do not remember 
to have seen in print before, the anecdote of Billow, 
coming upon the platform after an atrociously bad 
piece of vocalization, and softly preluding on the 
theme from the Ninth Symphony : 

" O brothers, these tones no longer ! Rather let us 
join to sing in cheerful measures a song of joyfulness." 

He had an intelligent audience, and the joke achieved 
complete success. Readers of Longfellow's early 
prose will recall the story of the French dramatist 
author whose piece was entitled " L'amour a vaincu 
Loth" (vingt culottes) the announcement of which 
was greeted from the gallery with the cry, " Qu'il 
en donne une a 1'auteur," the author being known 
as an impecunious and seedy individual. This story 
is matched by Mr. Apthorp as follows : An actor 
had the line : " Mon pere k manger m'apporte," and 
the interpellation from the gallery was : " Eh bien ! 
alors, pourquoi done que tu ne files pas ? " Upon 
one of Mr. Apthorp's essays we feel impelled to 
comment. He is writing of " The Non-Musician's 
Enjoyment of Music," and seems really puzzled to 
understand how it is that a man may take pleasure 
in hearing a composition of the technical structure 
of which he cannot possibly have any grasp. That 
a musician should be thus perplexed makes us sus- 
picious that he himself does not enjoy music in the 
true sense that he subordinates the essence of 
such enjoyment to its accidents. It is much as if a 
philologist should ask how a reader can enjoy Shake- 
speare without knowing anything of the natural 
history of Shakespeare's language, or of the rhe- 
torical and syntactical terminology with which the 



philologist sets forth his analysis. No doubt the 
complete knowledge of the musician may add to his 
enjoyment of a composition, but to assume that it 
supplies the chief element of that enjoyment is to 
misapprehend the very nature of all artistic achieve- 
ment. The musician and the non-musician alike 
enjoy in music the rich emotional experience of the 
composer, in which they become temporary partici- 
pants ; this is the chief thing to say. In addition, 
the musician gets a certain intellectual satisfaction 
out of his appreciation of the structure of the work 
to which he is listening, but this is of small account 
in comparison with the message which the music 
has for all listeners alike, for the untrained no less 
than for the trained. 

The transition is a natural one from Mr. Ap- 
thop's little books, which are largely reminiscent of 
the musical life of Boston in the sixties and seven- 
ties, to the interesting biography of John Sullivan 
Dwight, who was for nearly half a century the mu- 
sical autocrat of the city in which he lived. In pre- 
paring this biography Mr. George Willis Cooke has 
done a highly acceptable piece of work, besides con- 
tributing an important new chapter to the spiritual 
history of New England's greatest period. The 
interest of Dwight's life is, of course, more than a 
narrowly musical one. It relates to Brook Farm 
and the Saturday Club only in lesser measure than 
to the art that he chose for his special domain of 
criticism. He knew most of the choice spirits of 
his time, and enjoyed both their esteem and their 
love. The story of his life is thus deeply rooted in 
all that was noblest and best in mid-century New 
England, and the associations evoked by its pages 
are indeed various. This extra-musical interest is 
so great that the book will find as many readers 
among those why do not care for the art (" Es muss 
doch solche Kauze geben '') as among those who 
do. As a critic of music, and as editor of his 
"Journal " for twenty years, the influence of Dwight 
upon the development of taste was great and lasting, 
this in spite of obvious limitations and short- 
comings. And there is always something inspiring 
in the contemplation of any life which, like his, is 
consistently devoted to the furtherance of high 
ideals, and which scorns to purchase popular favor 
at the price of sincerity. 

Dr. T. L. Phipson, the author of " Voice and 
Violin," is an old-timer in more senses than one. 
A writer who speaks of the " sublime beauties " of 
Bellini, comparing that tuneful composer with Dante 
and Shakespeare, cannot be taken very seriously ; 
yet his volume of " Sketches, anecdotes, and remin- 
iscences is by no means devoid of a certain sort of 
interest. The author is himself a veteran violinist, 
and this is not the first book of the kind that he has 
put forth. He draws upon a rich fund of pleasant 
material, gleaned from out-of-the-way sources and 
a life of personal associations with his fellow-artists, 
the whole being arranged with little or no coherence, 
and interesting in bits rather than as an entirety. 

Music is only an incident, although an important 



342 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



one, in the series of " essays on art and its relation 
to life " that Mr. Edward Carpenter has brought 
together into a volume entitled " Angels' Wings." 
The titular essay has for its text the query of many 
a child, on viewing the winged figures of sculpture 
and painting, as to how these beings got their clothes 
on, a query supplemented in maturer years by one 
concerning the anatomical difficulties of the concep- 
tion of a winged human figure. To the author, the 
abandonment of wings in the later developments of 
art is symbolical of the process by which art first 
becomes real, and enters into the fullest relations with 
life. "Art and Democracy " is the essential subject of 
this entire volume (as it is the literal subject of one 
of the chapters), and we must say that we approached 
the author's treatment with misgivings. There has 
been so much rubbish written of late upon this sub- 
ject, from Count Tolstoy down to the least of the 
Whitmaniacs, that suspicion is surely justifiable in 
such a case. Relief soon came, however, in a char- 
acterization of Count Tolstoy's " What Is Art ? " as 
" that strange jumble of real acumen and bad logic, 
of large-heartedness and fanaticism," and the fur- 
ther expression of regret that the great Russian 
writer " should be so completely dominated by the 
fear of the senses." Mr. Carpenter's attempted 
parallel between Wagner, Millet, and Whitman, 
also gave us pause, until it was discovered that he 
did not push it to an illegitimate extent. Our mis- 
givings thus removed, it was discovered that the 
essays were both stimulating and subtly suggestive, 
the product of a trained and regulated intellect, 
occupied with matters of the gravest human con- 
cern. The strictly musical section of the work is 
confined to the two chapters devoted to the sonatas 
and later symphonies of Beethoven. Here we have 
aesthetic interpretation of a very fine sort, which 
contrives to express the full of enthusiasm without 
plunging into excess of rhapsody. We commend 
these beautiful chapters to all lovers of music. 

There has been much talk in England during the 
past two or three years concerning the " new criti- 
cism " of music. The foremost exponents of this 
development are Mr. G. Bernard Shaw and Mr. 
James F. Runciman, who have had for their spe- 
cial organ " The Saturday Review," and whose most 
characteristic work is represented by two volumes 
now at hand. Of this " new criticism " in general 
it may be said that it is so violent a reaction from 
the severely academic and technical method that it 
tends to defeat itself by its own excesses. It is 
bound to be startling at any cost, and in its strain- 
ing for effects it strays far from the paths of sobri- 
ety. Yet we cannot deny that it makes interesting 
reading, is provocative of thought, and that a sound 
kernel is nearly always to be extracted from the 
husks of its paradoxical envelope. Mr. Shaw's " The 
Perfect Wagnerite," for example, is the work of a 
writer who really does appreciate the greatness of 
the Wagnerian art, and this being the case we shall 
not quarrel with him for seeking to make a pre- 
posterous interpretation of the Niblung story accord- 



ing to Wagner. If it amuses him to read a socialistic 
system of doctrine into the " Ring," it amuses his 
readers no less ; and we have no fear that they will 
take the vagary any too seriously. We are given, 
for instance, such extraordinary interpretations as 
this of the Tarnhelm : 

" This helmet is a very common article in our streets, 
where it generally takes the form of a tall hat. It 
makes a man invisible as a shareholder, and changes 
him into various shapes, such as a pious Christian, a 
subscriber to hospitals, a benefactor of the poor, a model 
husband and father, a shrewd, practical, independent 
Englishman, and what not, when he is really a pitiful 
parasite on the commonwealth, consuming a great deal, 
and producing nothing, knowing nothing, believing 
nothing, and doing nothing except what all the rest do, 
and that only because he is afraid not to do it, or at least 
pretend to do it." 

Mr. Runciman, dedicating his " Old Scores and 
New Readings " to the quondam editor of the 
" Review " in which the chapters first saw the light, 
makes some attempt to explain the attitude toward 
music of the " new critic." 

" If criticism is to be written at all, it must be written 
with a view of giving us new sensations and emotions 
and thoughts: it must open a new world to our view, 
the world created by the energy and temperament of 
the man who writes it. ... I claim to look at music 
with the expert's knowledge and with all my faculties, 
to see it always in relation to humanity, to all the activ- 
ities, thoughts, desires, joys, and sorrows of humanity: 
in a word, in relation to life. To me an opera or mass 
of Mozart or a symphony of Beethoven is not only a 
complete thing, but also an extension of the composer's 
individuality, which I never forget nor could find it 
possible to forget." 

This is certainly a lucid statement of a doctrine 
essentially sound, our only objection being to its 
excess of emphasis upon the subjective element of 
criticism ; for in music, as in literature, we believe 
in the existence of objective standards, which it is 
the business of the critic to recognize, and to assert 
in every possible way. Mr. Runciman is three- 
fourth a sane and rational critic ; the other fourth 
of him, we regret to say, is compounded of paradox 
and prejudice. But he has all due reverence for 
the masters Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner and 
expresses it in no merely perfunctory forms of 
speech. He has, moreover, the saving grace of a true 
appreciation of Mozart, and he who has this cannot 
go far astray. Mr. Runciman has produced what is 
certainly one of the most readable books of musical 
criticism that have ever come to our notice. 

Mr. Vernon Blackburn, who for a time took Mr. 
Runciman's place as critic for the " Saturday," is a 
gentler spirit who writes graceful little papers round 
about music " The Fringe of an Art," he appro- 
priately names his volume. He is a trifle over- 
subtle at times, as in the following distinction be- 
tween melody and tune : 

"Tune is melody a little overripe. The adjectives 
that are applicable to melody are of an order altogether 
different from those applicable to tune. You associate 
tune with a suspicion of slang; melody demands the

THE DIAL

language of literature. The quality, for instance, that 
gives melody the title of ' beautiful ' inspires you to call 
a tune ' fetching.' Gluck never wrote a ' tune ' in his 
life; Rossini seldom wrote pure melody." 

And yet there is an undoubted truth back of this 
rather strained antithesis. Sometimes Mr. Black- 
burn gives us a pretty epigram, as when he calls 
Tschaikowsky " a barbarian smitten by the musical 
Zeit-geist" And sometimes he writes words of 
true inspiration, as these of Wagner's last work : 

" Just now I compared the whole work to the opening 
and shutting of a flower; and I would use the same 
illustration to describe the separate motifs and particu- 
larly the Good Friday music of Parsifal.' They open, 
as it were, like the petals of a flower, slowly expanding, 
to reveal the depth and beauty of the blossom, and they 
close rhythmically, leaving unutterable memories, and 
dim, tearful signs of beauty within the inner circles of 
the heart. They are full of thoughts that lie too deep 
for tears. Long after the ear has listened to the actual 
sound, they return with a power, with an overwhelming 
and indefinite shadowing, that make this music a thing 
forever apart and sacred." 

If one had to restrict his musical library to a 
single volume, we doubt if he could do better than 
select the work called "Music and Musicians" 
which has just been translated from the French of 
M. Albert Lavignac. It is only a few months since 
we reviewed M. Lavignac's admirable work on 
Wagner ; and we find in this new volume the same 
lucidity of exposition, the same economy of arrange- 
ment, and the same comprehensiveness that make 
the Wagner volume one of the very best that have 
ever been prepared upon its subject. "Music and 
Musicians" gives us the acoustics of music, the gram- 
mar of the art, the description of the instruments 
which express it, and its history stated with much 
biographical and bibliographical detail. The volume 
is in fact, although not in form, a veritable encyclo- 
paedia of music, and will be found equally satisfac- 
tory as a work of reference and as a text-book for 
the actual study of counterpoint, the structure of 
instruments, the history of music, and the physical 
basis of musical production. A few supplementary 
pages, by Mr. H. E. Krehbiel, add American com- 
posers to M. Lavignac's list, and put the finishing 
touch of usefulness upon a work which we cordially 
recommend to both students and general readers.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Whatever else the critics may say of 
Mr * Charles H. Peck's book on "The 
Jacksonian Epoch " (Harper), they 
are pretty certain to agree that it is readable. The 
period has always been one of great interest to stu- 
dents of our history and politics, and it is more likely 
to become still more interesting than less as time 
goes on. No doubt the " questions " of the epoch, 
or at least most of them, are now seen to have been 



monstrously exaggerated by the men who partici- 
pated in their discussion ; but the loss of interest on 
this score is more than made up by the better un- 
derstanding of the epoch itself as a period of national 
transition. Then, Mr. Peck is well read on his 
theme, and has thrown his materials into good lit- 
erary form. He is, indeed, altogether too sure of 
some things, but his very positiveness will be one of 
the best features of his book to some minds. An- 
other of his merits is his distinct conception of the 
fact that, in the epoch treated, far less was due to 
what Carlyle called " individualities," and far more 
to general causes, than our fathers supposed. He 
sees clearly, for example, that General Jackson was 
a man of his time, and the Jackson party a party 
of its time ; he sees that the American republic was 
bound not only to become democratized, but to be- 
come democratized in a rude way ; and yet he 
might advantageously have used space that he has 
given to minor matters to give a fuller and better 
exposition of the causes that made these things inev- 
itable. The topic is an inviting one, and has never 
been adequately treated in all its bearings by any 
writer. So confident a writer as our author with 
such a subject could not have avoided offering nu- 
merous moot points to the critic. Here it must be 
said that if he is never dull he is often wrong or 
paradoxical. We read on one page that John Ran- 
dolph, having retired from political leadership, " re- 
mained to the end of his days the most consistent 
advocate, barring his occasional extravagances and 
abberrations, of the true theory of government," 
and on another page that he organized the South 
to a systematic defense of the slaveholding interest, 
and formulated the political theory by which it was 
to be maintained ; moreover, this theory "was wholly 
derived from the political doctrines with which he 
had begun public life." The meaning, of course, is 
that Randolph's devotion to slavery was merely one 
of his " extravagances " or " abberrations," and 
ought not to be counted against him in determining 
his rank as a political philosopher. Mr. Peck adds : 
" It is one of the seeming paradoxes of politics that 
the ablest early exponents of democracy were slave- 
holders." From his point of view he should have 
added, " and often aristocrats." The account of the 
introduction of the spoils system presents some very 
just observations and important facts that the stu- 
dent of the time needs to heed, but it cannot be 
accepted as a proper presentation of the subject. 
Mr. Peck thinks that John Quincy Adams was more 
to blame for the system than Jackson, owing to his 
absolute refusal to allow political considerations to 
influence the retention or selection of appointees, 
which stimulated the clamor and the efforts of the 
multiplying " outs." Even more unsatisfactory is 
the handling of the slavery question. The author 
sees that slavery was a great evil, but he criticizes 
all the men who strove to oppose it, and the Aboli- 
tionists with great fierceness ; but he does not, that 
we remember, drop a single hint as to what should 
have been done in reference to slavery. Nothing

is easier than to criticize every practical proposition 
that was ever made, looking to the doing away of 
the institution, or to restricting its influence ; but it 
was in the country, and something had to be done 
about it, as a writer of history at this late day ought 
to discern. 

Chapters from There are few books of the P* 81 year 
the inner life which thoughtful readers will find 

of a philosopher. better worth peru8a l t h an J^ J^ 

Beattie Crozier's remarkable piece of mental auto- 
biography entitled "My Inner Life" (Longmans). 
Mr. Crozier is the distinguished author of two pro- 
found and original works (one of them as yet un- 
finished) in the field of social philosophy ; and upon 
the general system therein unfolded the present Life 
has certain specific bearings. As we gather from 
the author's brief Autobiography, one of the main 
considerations that led him to compose the present 
work was the belief that the philosophic system 
elaborated in his books on " Civilization and Pro- 
gress " and " The History of Intellectual Develop- 
ment " could be most clearly expounded and in a 
measure popularized through a detailed account of 
the successive steps by which it grew and took shape 
in his own mind. We may therefore regard " My 
Inner Life " not only as an autobiography proper 
(and it is a thoroughly charming and singularly 
candid one), but as in some sort a clew or supple- 
ment to the author's larger works. With a gener- 
ous leaven of lighter episode and digression, Mr. 
Crozier traces in the main the story of his intel- 
lectual life and effort, from the immature days of 
his early dabblings in phrenology down to the period 
of measurably settled philosophic conviction. The 
chapters describing the author's earlier examination 
of the various abstruser philosophic systems are rich 
in comment and suggestion, and they should prove 
most helpful to the tyro in need of those brief indi- 
catory hints or flashes of elementary exposition and 
illustration which so often are to the puzzled be- 
ginner the magic key to the essential understanding 
of a novel system of thought. Mr. Crozier's account 
of the simple mental devices and homely compari- 
sons that helped him through his first perplexities 
in respect to thinkers like Kant and Emerson may 
well prove serviceable to the student whose path is 
blocked by like difficulties. Very delightful and 
refreshingly free from stale conventions are Mr. 
Crozier's chapters on men like Macaulay, De Quin- 
cey, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Arnold, Addison, the exem- 
plars of literary form to whom he turned succes- 
sively during the period of his efforts to achieve a 
style that might serve to allure the public to a con- 
sideration of his ideas. The opening chapters of 
the volume sketch with a light and animated touch 
the story of the writer's boyhood in a Canadian 
town, and introduce to us some odd, Shandean 
humorists notably a queer character called the 
" Man with the Bootjack," of whom Mr. Crozier 
might make much should he care to turn his hand 
to fiction. The book has a rich anecdotal and remi- 



niscential side. The most amusing chapter in this 
kind tells of a visit to Carlyle at Chelsea, under- 
taken by the author with a view of finding counsel 
and solace at a time of spiritual difficulties. He 
found the oracle in a bad humor, which was vented in 
abuse of eminent fellow-thinkers whom Mr. Crozier 
was rash enough to quote as worth consideration. 
Stuart Mill, for instance, was waved aside by the 
sage as " a thin, wire-drawn, sawdustish, logic- 
chopping kind of body," while Herbert Spencer was 
flatly dubbed " An immeasurable ass ! " As to the 
latter thinker, Mr. Carlyle went on to say : " And 
so ye have been meddling with Spencer, have ye ? 
He was brought to me by Lewes, and a more con- 
ceited young man I thought I had never seen. He 
seemed to think himself just a perfect Owl of 
Minerva for knowledge ! " and then, looking fiercely 
at Mr. Crozier, " ye '11 get little good out of him, 
young man." Must it not be regretfully owned 
that, with all his genius, Thomas Carlyle's nature 
was warped by some of the meanest, most hateful 
qualities that can disfigure humanity ? Mr. Crozier's 
book is a rarely readable, multifarious, and nutri- 
tive one of is kind ; and we heartily recommend it 
to our readers. 

Mystery and '^ nat t ^ ie ^ ate Elizabeth of Austria, 

romance of the a woman whose dislike of publicity 
Austrian Empress, became latterly a sort of mania, and 
who had ever loved to draw the veil of privacy alike 
over her benefactions and her sorrows, should have 
met death at the hands of a man whose chief motive 
for his deed was a thirst for notoriety, suggests a dra- 
matic contrast. Not long before the tragedy at Gen- 
eva, Luccheni, the assassin, said to a friend, " I am 
going to kill some person of high rank, so that I can 
at last see my name in the newspapers." This 
wretched fellow seems to have been a mere " notori- 
ety crank" of the dangerous sort who turn naturally 
to murder as the swiftest and surest means of gaining 
the distinction they crave. The web of the career of 
Elizabeth of Austria was woven largely of sorrow 
and romance, and the terrible closing episode of 
her life was scarcely more grimly tragic than some 
incidents that preceded it. Elizabeth was warm- 
hearted, generous, visionary, and eccentric. She 
was a rarely interesting and striking personality, 
and much was written of her during her life and 
immediately after her death. The two handsome 
volumes now before us " Elizabeth Empress of 
Austria," by A. De Burgh (Lippincott), and "The 
Martyrdom of an Empress" (Harper), represent, 
we think, the first attempts at a full and definitive 
account of her life and character. Both books are 
extremely readable, and each occupies a field of its 
own. Mr. De Burgh gives us a fairly written and 
tolerably accurate continuous biographical sketch, 
in which the profuse and well chosen illustrations 
form a commendable feature. The anonymous au- 
thor of "The Martyrdom of an Empress" confines 
herself in the main to matter of her own personal ob- 
servation and recollection. Her attitude is frankly 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

that of an adorer of her heroine, and her adoration is 
clearly unfeigned and not ill-grounded. She des- 
cribes herself as having been for some time the 
Empress's " only confidante and truest friend," and 
readers seeking personal details and "revelations" 
as to family concerns and secrets will find their 
account in her hook. A notable chapter is the one 
wherein the writer unriddles, or professes to unriddle, 
the ghastly episode at Mayerling, to which the gos- 
siping world has long sought the key. The book 
is picturesquely and effusively written, and bears 
every evidence of originating from the fulness of 
immediate knowledge. Many guesses will doubt- 
less be made at the author's identity. There are a 
number of pleasing illustrations, mainly portraits. 

In our issue of March 1, 1898, we 

reviewed at 8ome len s th the initial 

volume of the Earl of Suffolk and 
Berkshire's " Encyclopaedia of Sport." The second 
and concluding volume (Li Z) of this sumptuous 
work is now issued (Putnam) and it shows the same 
wealth of illustration and degree of expert collabo- 
ration that we praised in its predecessor. There 
are twenty full-page photogravures, together with 
a profusion of text-cuts ; and the table of contents 
shows a great array of names whose authority sports- 
men throughout the English-speaking world will 
recognize. Among these we may note Sir W. M. 
Conway, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, Mr. John Bick- 
erdyke, Mr. Caspar Whitney, Captain Hutton, Mr. 
G. E. A. Ross, Lord Dunraven, Mr. A. Rogers, 
Mr. A. E. T. Watson, Mr. A. Trevor-Battye, etc. 
In short, each article has been undertaken by a well- 
known expert and enthusiast in the branch of sport 
it treats of. Racing, Riding, Mountaineering, the 
Moors, the Partridge, the Pheasant, the Red Deer, 
Rowing, Yachting, Shooting, Salmon, Wrestling, 
Trout, Swimming, Skating, are among the leading 
themes in this volume. We were a little surprised to 
find included an article on Snakes snake-hunting 
being a form of sport we should scarcely expect to 
see anyone given to. But Mr. P. W. L'Estrange, 
who contributes this section, writes with due enthu- 
siasm of his pet pastime, and favors us with some 
explicit directions how to catch and keep snakes 
which we shall be very careful not to follow. The 
volumes make a good showing in their substantial 
bindings of dark-green buckram ; and they certainly 
form a very desirable adjunct to the sportsman's 
library. 

A forecaster of Dr - Sylvanus P. Thompson has done 
electric science a real service in his clear and concise 
fifty year, ago. mem oir of the great physicist Fara- 
day (Macmillan). At the Royal Institution of 
London, Faraday was the connecting link between 
Davy and Tyndall. Beginning with chemistry, his 
work was expended mainly upon studies which led 
to the discovery of the fundamental principles of 
the electric science of to-day. His mental vision 
was singularly acute. It discriminated clearly the 
facts revealed by his skilful experimentation, it per- 



ceived the relations between these facts and the 
science then known, and by an intuition almost 
divine it discerned the avenues leading to further 
progress. Like our own Henry, he made his life 
wholly unselfish. He bent all his energies to the 
elucidation of science, and was singularly oblivious 
to the seductions of wealth. For years he served 
the Royal Institution for the pittance of $500 per 
annum, with fuel, lights, and the house-room of two 
apartments for himself and his wife. Afterwards 
he was made rich with a pension of $1500 per an- 
num. Although constantly making discoveries of 
great commercial value, he never claimed for them 
any patent rights. It cannot be said of him, as of 
a famous American electrician, that the grass could 
not grow in the path between his laboratory and the 
patent office. The most notable of Faraday's dis- 
coveries were those of terrestrial magnetism ; the 
para-magnetic or dia-magnetic qualities which char- 
acterize and classify all substances ; and the basic 
principles of magneto-electric induction which fore- 
shadowed all the remarkable modern developments 
in dynamic electricity and the uses of electric mo- 
tors. He was not forgetful of the practical utilities 
of the forces he found. For example, in 1847 he 
proposed to the officials of Trinity House to mark 
harbor channels with incandescent lights carrying 
electric platinum wire spirals, and later gave much 
attention to the lighting of lighthouses by electricity. 
His life furnishes a most inspiring chapter in the 
history of modern science. 

Scattered through the pages of his- 
tory, such accounts as there are of 
the city of Rouen leave little impres- 
sion of its importance ; brought into the compass of 
a single book as in the pretty volume in the 
" Mediaeval Towns " series (Macmillan) written by 
Mr. Theodore Andrea Cook, illustrated by Helen 
M. James and Jane E. Cook, ^the ancient city 
fairly looms. The book is interesting, and serves 
to bind one's knowledge into a Compact and port- 
able sheaf. Rouen is recalled as the closing scene 
in the tragic history of Joan of Arc. It is also the 
city whence William the Bastard set forth for his 
conquest of England ; the home of those delicious 
kings of Yvet6t whom BeVanger sang and Thack- 
eray kept in memory ; the birthplace of Corneille, 
for whom a street has been named ; the place of 
Lord Clarendon's death ; the former residence of 
Pascal, where he invented his calculating machine, 
and a long list of other matters of less interest 
are to be gathered from these annals. The book is 
delicately and beautifully illustrated, and well pro- 
vided with maps. 

Lieutenant Peary made two cam-

a ready fellow for all the peculiar conditions which 
befall an explorer. This young man has given us,

in "With Peary Near the Pole" (Lippincott), a 
very readable book. After briefly outlining the two 
campaigns, he takes the points of interest by chap- 
ters. The most instructive of these are " The Na- 
tives of Smith's Sound," " Hunting," " Sledge Jour- 
neys of the Esquimaux," " The Esquimaux Manner 
of Life, Customs, Character, Moral and Social 
Circumstances," " Intelligence and Artistic Gifts, 
Religious Ideas, Customs," etc. The Greenland dog 
also claims large attention, as he is the most import- 
ant factor in Esquimau-travelling. The author 
vividly sets before his readers the hardships of that 
frozen clime, the life of its hardy occupants, and 
the struggle for existence on the part of every liv- 
ing thing. The results of the expeditions were not 
great, but the good done the natives, the more cer- 
tain definition of some coast-line of Greenland, and 
a knowledge through other eyes of the life of those 
regions, fully justify the appearance of this contri- 
bution of Mr. Astrup. 

In the " feminine renaissance " now 

u P on U8 ' . one of the most interesting 
features is the sort of book which is 
becoming possible through the remarkable interest 
taken by woman in herself and her ancestresses. 
While a number of paltry novels continue to pour 
out upon the world for the more belated of the 
sisterhood, such a book as " The Reign of Margaret 
of Denmark " (London : T. Fisher Unwin), by Mary 
Hill, is surely in response to the newly awakened 
sense of feminine importance. Queen Margaret 
was one of those earlier women who found time 
both to rock the cradle and to rule the world (to 
adapt Wallace's phrase), the latter very literally so 
far as the Scandinavian peninsula is concerned. She 
was daughter to that King Valdemar who made a 
rather famous reply to the Pope upon occasion ; 
wife to Hakon, King of Norway ; mother to Olaf , 
King of Denmark ; mother by marriage to Philippa, 
daughter of Henry IV. of England ; conqueror of 
Albert, king of Sweden, upon whose captive head 
she set a fool's cap in reply to an earlier gift from 
him of a stone to sharpen her scissors on ; and was 
in every respect a queenly, almost a kingly, woman. 
Miss Hill has brought the scanty facts concerning 
her into a succinct and very entertaining narrative, 
which should be exceedingly encouraging to all wo- 
men of to-day who need encouragement. 



Matter as intimate as that which goes 
to make up P. A. Sergyeenko's " How 
Count L. N. Tolstoy Lives and 
Works " (Crowell) is seldom free from f ulsomeness ; 
but if a minor modern Boswell, Sergyeenko is still 
a Boswell, moreover, he has a keen sense of hu- 
mor. Pleasant anecdote enlivens his pages, and 
goes far to redeem what might be called the " cant 
of familiarily with the great." Upon an occasion, 
Tolstoy was recognized on the street by an admirer 
not less drunk than enthusiastic. Rushing up to 
the author, with rolling eye, he exclaimed, " Oh, 



Home and 
private life 
of Tolstoy. 



Count Tolstoy, I am your adorer and imitator ! " 
The irrepressible American, man and woman, visits 
the Count with frequency. Two of our women 
called one day to inform him that they had travelled 
around the world in opposite directions, and were 
now met at his house in accordance with their agree- 
ment. " You might have made a better use of your 
time," said he. " There ! I told you he 'd say some- 
thing like that," they exclaimed to one another. 
The book, for all its praise, leaves the chief of Rus- 
sian writers human, which is probably all that should 
be asked from it in addition to the undoubted en- 
tertainment it provides. Miss Isabel F. Hapgood 
furnishes the translation, and the book is attrac- 
tively illustrated. 

Mr. Augustine Birrell, essayist, mem- 
ber of parliament, queen's counsel, 
and professor of law at University 
College, London, is an ideal lecturer on such a topic 
as is now embodied in " The Law of Copyright "; 
and his small book forms a suitable and valuable 
appendix to the greater work on the same subject 
from the pen of Mr. George Haven Putnam, who, 
fitly, is the publisher also of Mr. Birrell's book. 
The latter has given the subject a literary treat- 
ment what could deserve one more ? and is most 
amiably enthusiastic over the future. While he adds 
not a great deal to the information contained in the 
larger American work, he does present another 
point of view, and is exceedingly encouraging.

Mme. Blanc (Th. Bentzon) is a most industrious 
maker of books, and turns to the account of " copy "

A list of no less than thirty-three volumes is now cred- 
ited to her pen, the last of these being a collection of 
" Notes de Voyage " concerning " Nouvelle-France et 
Nouvelle-Angleterre" (Paris: C. Le"vy). Three-fourths 
of this readable volume are devoted to Canada, its 
women, its education, and its scenery. The other fourth 
is a series of rapid impressions of New England. Mme. 
Blanc is always a pleasing writer, and we have read 
these random sketches with much interest. 

The Text-Book of General Physics " (Ginn), pre- 
pared by Drs. Charles S. Hastings and Frederick E. 
Beach of Yale University, is a work of advanced grade 
for the use of colleges and scientific schools. It is es- 
sentially " a strictly quantitative study of various trans- 
ferences and transformations of energy," and as such, 
treats the subject of mechanics in an exceptionally 
thorough manner. It presupposes trigonometry but not 
calculus. We note one special feature in the form of a 
chapter on the limiting powers of optical instruments. 

A welcome volume in the " Temple Classics " series 
(Macmillan) is that containing the " Shorter Poems " of 
Shelley, edited by Mr. H. Buxton Forman. The vol-

Shelley's shorter poems, fifteen or sixteen in all; the 
short lyrics being (presumably) reserved for a separate 
volume.

Dr. B. A. Hinsdale's well-authenticated work on 
" The Old Northwest," issued several years ago, is to 
appear in a new and revised edition from the press of 
Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. 

Messrs. Eldredge & Brother publish a revised edi- 
tion of the text-book by John S. Hart, entitled " A 
Manual of Composition and Rhetoric." The revision 
has been made by Professor James Morgan Hart. 

Professor N. P. Gilman, whose book on " Profit Shar- 
ing " appeared a few years ago^ is at work on a related 
volume to be issued in the Fall by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. with the title A Dividend to Labor." 

The phenomenal success of " Mr. Dooley " justifies 
his publishers (Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co.) in an- 
nouncing a new book by him, " Mr. Dooley in the Hearts 
of his Countrymen," to be published in a few months. 
His first book, " Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War," has, 
it is said, reached a sale of fifty thousand copies. 

The Chautauqua Assembly announcements for 1899 
include a number of courses in literature, among them 
being lectures by Professor C. T. Winchester of Wes- 
leyau University; Professor Alcee' Fortier of Tulane 
University ; and Mr. Walter H. Page, the editor of the 
" Atlantic Monthly," who will treat " The Practical As- 
pects of Literature." 

A call has been issued for the organization of an 
Illinois Historical Society, an institution which is emi- 
nently desirable. A preliminary meeting of those inter- 
ested will be held at the University of Illinois, on the 
nineteenth of this month, and all who wish to do so are 
invited to attend. A special rate of one fare for the 
round trip to Champaign can be had from all points in 
the State. 

The Superintendent of Public Schools in Chicago has, 
it is stated by the daily press, instructed the school 
principals to teach their pupils that " thru " spells 
through, " altho " spells although, and other philological 
vagaries. If there are any " fine old educational mas- 
todons " in our School Board, this seems to be a case 
where the mastodontic foot should be put down, and 
put down hard. 

A valuable addition to American bibliography is fur- 
nished in the new Catalogue of Authors whose works 
are published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Bos- 
ton. It includes the best of our native writers of the 
century, and illustrates the supremacy of this house in 
American literature. The catalogue, with more than 



two hundred pages, well printed and neatly bound in 
boards, gives brief biographical sketches of the authors, 
with the titles of their books and the year of their pub- 
lication. Great care has been taken to secure accuracy 
and precision of statement. The frontispiece contains 
a photogravure of a group of six great American authors 
Longfellow, Emerson, Hawthorne, Whittier, Holmes, 
and Lowell. 

Heretofore there has been but one scientific journal 
in the world devoted to the prevention and cure of tuber- 
culosis; this was published at Paris. Another of like 
character has now been started in this country, at Ashe-

Karl von Ruck, a prominent specialist, as editor, and 
Mr. A. H. McQuilkin, well and favorably known in 
Chicago, as publisher. 

It is expected that the " War of the Rebellion 
Record of the Union and Confederate Armies," that 
most elaborate of our Government publications, will be 
completed in little over a year. Begun in 1874, the 
work has gone deliberately on, and will represent, when 
completed, an outlay of nearly three millions of dollars. 
The total number of volumes will be one hundred and 
twenty-nine, of which only about fifteen are yet un- 
priuted or undistributed. 

The University of Wisconsin has hitherto had no 
summer session, although Madison has been a favorite 
meeting-place for institutions of the Chautauqua type. 
The University now announces a summer school of six 
weeks' duration, beginning July 3, 1899. The courses 
cover all the principal departments, and are fully 
manned by resident and non-resident lecturers. Credit 
toward degrees will be given for work done at this ses- 
sion, just as has been the case from the start with the 
University of Chicago, of whose example the sister insti- 
tution is evidently emulous. 

Some curious questions regarding the rights of liter- 
ary property are raised by a suit against Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons, brought by Mr. Rudyard Kipling, who 
appears to have quite regained his vigorous health. It 
seems that the firm named lately purchased from various 
American publishers of Mr. Kipling's works some copies 
of these books in sheets, which they then bound up in 
their own styles of covers and offered for sale in their 
retail store in complete sets. So far, there was nothing 
unusual in this, the re-binding of books being common 
in the retail trade, and the sheets purchased yielding 
Mr. Kipling, of course, whatever royalty was fixed be- 
tween him and his authorized publishers who sold the 
sheets to the Messrs. Putnam. There was thus evidently 
no intention to interfere with the author's rights of roy- 
alty, since he was sure of his legal percentages, no mat- 
ter in what form the works were sold. But in re-binding 
the volumes the Messrs. Putnam had given the set the 
name of " Brushwood edition," and used decorations 
which are claimed to be in the nature of trade-marks; 
and here the legal rights are not so easily determinable. 
A further grievance is the inclusion, in this alleged " edi- 
tion," of matter which Mr. Kipling repudiates; and the 
arrangement of the pieces and the general scheme he 
regards as unauthorized and injurious. The develop- 
ments of the suit will be watched with much interest. 
It is but fair to add that the defendants have a reputa- 
tion for punctiliousness in their regard for the rights of 
authors as well as for the courtesies of the trade; and 
any injury sustained by Mr. Kipling through them will 
be felt to be an inadvertence rather than a deliberate 
or conscious attempt at wrong.

and a Portrait. $1.50 net. 

" Now that the people of the South are raising a memorial 
to Timrod's fame, the suggestion seems a proper one to make,

American poet, and worthy to stand in the narrow space that 
belongs to the best." The Century.

The poems in this book are of the same high order of

TWO NEW BOOKS FOR STUDENTS OF SOCIAL QUESTIONS. 

Pauperizing the Rich. 

By ALFRED J. FERRIS. 

This book contains a discussion of the merits and demerits of our social system which does not belong in any 
of the recognized classes. It is neither anarchistic nor socialistic, nor does it uphold the Single Tax, the People's 
Party, or the Free Silver propaganda ; yet it contains an unsparing arraignment of the present re'gime, and proposes 
as a corrective a measure of reform which is not lacking in radicalism. Its aim, as stated in the preface, is " to 
be as conservative as the Liberty and Property Defence League and as radical as the Socialists. It accepts, at 
least in spirit, the aspirations of the most visionary reformers, and attempts to reach their substantial fulfilment 
by a measure which yet respects the great underlying principles of the existing social system, and which will 
stand the closest scrutiny of the practical intellect." 

The book is stated by the author to be " directly founded " upon Henry George's " Progress and Poverty," 
but its conclusions and the process of reasoning on which they are based are far from coinciding with those set 
forth in the monumental work of the great apostle of the Single Tax. I2mo, cloth, pp. -432, $1.25 

A Handbook of Labor Literature. 

Compiled by HELEN MAROT. 

The need of such a work as this, and the place which it must fill, have been brought to the attention of the 
compiler in the course of her work as librarian of the Free Library of Economics and Political Science, Phila- 
delphia. The constantly increasing volume and complexity of the literature on this subject have made it almost 
impossible even for specialists to keep abreast of its various growths, and have made it a trackless wilderness 
for the general reader. As librarians and others who are called on for advice upon the subject well know, it is a 
branch of inquiry which is increasingly attracting public attention, and on which intelligent advice is increasingly 
sought. It is as a help to the giving of such advice, and a direct guide to the general reader, that this work has 
been compiled and is now offered to the public. I2mo, cloth, $1.00

THE BREAK=UP OF CHINA 

WITH AN ACCOUNT OF ITS PRESENT COMMERCE, CURRENCY, WATERWAYS, 

ARMIES, RAILWAYS, POLITICS, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS 

By LORD CHARLES BERESFORD 

'"THE whole book is a series of well-authenticated statements of the present situation, of 
* the dangers that can be easily foreseen, and of the necessary work to be carried out if 
the Chinese Empire is to be held together, based upon interviews with the great Chinese 
Viceroys, the famous Tsung-li Yamen, the escaped reformer, Kang Yu Wei, and others. It 
is safe to say that no book upon China has been published during this century that gives in 
such small space so clear and straightforward a statement of the position China occupies 
and is likely to occupy in the commerce and politics of the world.

A THOUSAND DAYS IN THE ARCTIC 

By FREDERICK Q. JACKSON 

CVERYONE who read "Farthest North" will remember Nansen's interesting story of 
J ' his meeting with Frederick G. Jackson, the explorer, on the snow-fields of Franz- 
Josef Land, and of the valuable aid he received at Jackson's camp. The object of the 
Fram expedition was to reach the North Pole. Mr. Jackson's object was to ascertain the 
importance of Franz-Josef Land as a way to the Pole. For those who are interested in 
the Arctic regions in a scientific way, we need only to say that Mr. Jackson has fully 
demonstrated that the path to the Pole does not lie through Franz Josef Land. For those 
who want a fascinating book of travel and exploration, we add that in "A Thousand Days 
in the Arctic " such a book is to be found.

THE AWKWARD AGE 

A NOVEL. By HENRY JAMES 

'"THE announcement of a new novel by Mr. Henry James is always an important event 
in the world of letters. " The Awkward Age " is fully up to the high standard which 
Mr. James has set in u Daisy Miller," and " An International Episode." The London 
Academy once said that " Mr. James was constantly attempting the impossible, and con- 
stantly achieving it." In " The Awkward Age," Mr. James once more bears witness to 
the truth of the Academy's statement.

e ^ WHO'S WHO in America ' 

A Dictionary of Living Men and Women in the United States Who Have Gained More 

Than Local Distinction. 

THIS work aims to give (as near as may be) a short sketch a speaking biography as it were of every 
living man and woman in America who has gained more than local distinction: brief, crisp, and to the point, 
giving no place to eulogy, but answering with sufficient fulness the question: Who's Who ? It is confined to no 
class or profession, but tells something of those who are prominent in every walk of life: Americans who are 
active as statesmen, scientists, authors, artists, educators, clergymen, lawyers, physicians, engineers, 
poets, literateurs, librarians, historians, farmers, architects, reformers, labor leaders, musicians, 
actors, editors, merchants, manufacturers, sculptors, engravers, soldiers, sailors, public officials, 
inventors, financiers, business men, and, in fact, people of worth and note in all branches of usefulness. 

OVER EIGHT THOUSAND LIVING AMERICANS 

Who They Are, What They Are, Where They Are. 

The book is absolutely authentic. In hundreds of cases dates and facts are given which differ from other published 
accounts. That is because they have been obtained from first hands, and are therefore correct. 

The address of each person is also given an exceedingly valuable feature which no other work attempts to present. 
This book not only tells Who's Who, but Where's Who. 

Endorsed the World Over. Leading Americans in every part of the world commend this book : 
HON. LEV1 P. MORTON, ex-Vice President of the United 

States, writes: "An exceedingly useful book. Send me two 

copies." 
WILLIAM E. CURTIS, Washington Correspondent of the 

" Chicago Record ": " You are doing a great favor to the public 

generally, as well as to men in my profession, by printing this book. ' '

The Prometheus Bound of

This translation of the masterpiece of JEschylus is of

scholarship to insure accuracy and adequateness in his 
rendering, and the literary skill to give it an English

Dr. Scudder, who is well and widely known as an 

authority on butterflies, here gives familiar accounts of 

sixty or more of the commonest butterflies taken in the 

order of the season. The stories of the butterflies are 

written in a pleasing manner, and the descriptions of 

them and of their habits have the clearness and easy 

grace which come from the fullest knowledge. 



A First Book of Birds. 

By OLIVE THORNE MILLER, author of " Bird-Ways," 
" In Nesting-Time," " Little Brothers of the Air,"

20 full -page illustrations, of which 8 are colored^ 
Square 12mo, $1.00. 

In this book for young people and older ones whose 
bird education has been neglected, Mrs. Miller describes 
birds' nests, the young birds, their growth and how 
they are fed, how they get their feathers and are taught 
to fly and to do various other things. She tells of the 
language of birds, their food, their migrations, their 
mental and moral development, their structure, their 
economic value to mankind. She instructs how to attract 
birds to visit about our houses and how to study their 
ways.

PROFESSOR RIP LEY'S GREAT WORK. 

THE RACES OF EUROPE. 

A Sociological Study. By WILLIAM Z. RIPLKT, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Sociology, Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology ; Lecturer in Anthropology at Columbia University, in the city of New York. Crown 8vo, cloth, 650 pages, with 
85 Maps and 235 Portrait Types. With a Supplementary Bibliography of nearly 2000 Titles, separately bound in cloth. 
(178 pages). Price, $6.00. 

Professor Ripley's important work furnishes a lucid description of the present living population of Europe from the stand- 
point of the physical anthropologist, and shows the intimate relationship which has gradually arisen between man and his 
geographical environment. Simple maps, specially drawn for the purpose, and a rich collection of original portrait types from 
all parts of the continent, increase the interest of the text for the general reader. The book is especially suggestive to the 
observant traveller who ventures beyond the great cities, and who would understand the life history of the European peas- 
antry from a study of their physical traits, such as the stature, color of hair and eyes, head form, and features. The final 
chapter, concerning the possible adaptation of Europeans to the climate of the tropics, is of special interest in the United 
States at this time in connection with its recent policy of colonial expansion. 

Ready Shortly: ALASKA AND THE KLONDIKE. 

A Journey to the New Eldorado. With Hints to the Traveller and Observations on the Physical History and Geology of the 
Gold Regions, the Condition of and Methods of Working the Klondike Placers, and the Laws Governing and Regulating 
Mining in the Northwest Territory of Canada. By ANGELO HEILPRIN, Professor of Geology at the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London, Past-President of the Geographical Society 
of Philadelphia, etc. Fully illustrated from Photographs and with a New Map of the Gold Regions. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 
It may fairly be said that Professor Heilprin's interesting and authoritative book presents for the first time an accurate 
general account of the region which has so recently become famous. Much has been written about the Klondike, but a large 
proportion of this material contains so many exaggerations that a proper perspective is impossible. It was for the purpose 
of discriminating between fact and fancy by means of a personal knowledge of the region and its varied conditions that 
Professor Heilprin, an experienced traveller and the leader of the Peary Relief Expedition of 1892, made his journey through 
the region. He now presents the results of his observations in a series of graphic chapters which describe the features of the 
journey, the character of the country, and the life of the mining camps. To those specially interested in the practical possi- 
bilities of the region, the book will make a special appeal. Students will find it the first adequate presentation of the Klondike 
gold problem made by a geologist, and it will prove invaluable to prospectors and others practically interested, since it furnishes 
assistance not to be found in any other publication.

IMPERIAL DEMOCRACY. 

By DAVID STARR JORDAN, Ph.D., President of Leland Stan- 
ford, Junior, University. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
Dr. Jordan's striking and timely book presents the various phases 
of a democracy's entrance upon imperialism in the light of history as 
well as recent facts and developments. He analyzes our relations to 
the Philippines and discusses various plans of conduct. He draws les- 
sons from our management of Alaska. While the author is opposed to 
American control of subject races, his discussions are broad and fair, 
and his statements of the arguments on either side will prove of gen- 
eral interest and value at this time.

A HISTORY OF BOHEMIAN LITERATURE. 

By FRANCIS, COUNT LUTZOW. A new novel in the " Litera- 
atures of the World" series, edited by EDMUND GOSSE. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Beginning with the " Question of the Manuscripts," the author takes 
up the hymns, dating probably from the tenth century, which are the 
earliest uncontested writings. In developing the theme of early Bohe- 
mian poetry several valuable translations are furnished as illustrations. 
Another large phase of the subject, the development of Bohemian 
prose in the sixteenth century, is fully treated, together with the various 
new impulses of the last hundred years. The author has developed a 
comparatively unknown field with tact and scholarly discrimination, 
and his treatment of the subject is happily reinforced by translations 
of characteristic examples of Bohemian literature. 

A HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN NATION. 

By ANDREW C. MCLAUGHLIN, Professor of American His- 
tory in the University of Michigan. " Twentieth Century " 
series. With many Maps and Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.40 net. 

The purpose of this book is to trace the main outlines of national 
development, to show how the American people came to be what 
they are. 

These events have been so narrated that the reader will come to an 
appreciation of his political surroundings and of the political duties that 
devolve upon him. For this reason especial attention has been paid to 
political facts, to the rise of parties, to the issues involved in elections, 
to the development of governmental machinery, and, in general, to 
questions of government and administration. 

The illustrative feature and especially the maps have received the 
most careful attention, and it is hoped that they will be found accurate, 
truthful, and illustrative. In short, the book is believed worthy of a 
place in the front rank of the Twentieth Century Text-Books.

AN AMERICAN ACADEMY. 

What we once called " the Academy game " 
has of late been going merrily on in the pages 
of " Literature " that is, in the American 
edition thereof under the genial direction of 
Mr. John Kendrick Bangs, and it seems to be 
worth while to announce the outcome, and point 
two or three of the more obvious morals of this 
and other similar plans for organizing a body 
of " immortals " on our own side of the Atlan- 
tic. It is difficult for minds of a certain class 
to escape from the obsession of this idea. That 
it has worked well in France is not seriously 
to be disputed, in spite of sarcasms about the 



" forty-first armchair," and the unpleasant part 
played by intrigue and wire-pulling in filling 
the vacant seats. The French Forty have, on 
the whole, always constituted a distinguished 
body of thinkers and men of letters. If their 
number has failed to include, now and then, 
some writer who was one of the chief intellec- 
tual forces of his time, it has rarely given place 
to a writer who was either a charlatan or a 
nonentity. If it has not always risen to the 
height of its opportunities, at least it has not, 
on the other hand, fallen far below them. 

The secret of this relative and considerable 
success in bodying forth, for two centuries and 
a half, the fine idea of Richelieu, is due to the 
fact that popular suffrage has had next to 
nothing to do with the selection of academi- 
cians. It also suggests the reason why an 
American Academy would not be likely to be 
a body truly representative of American cul- 
ture. In other words, our democracy is still 
far from having learned the lesson that it is a 
farcical proceeding to settle some questions by 
popular vote, and we cannot imagine any plan 
of organization likely to win general accept- 
ance which should not be based, in consider- 
able measure, upon the suffrages of more people 
than could possibly be expected to act intelli- 
gently in so delicate a matter. 

Even the body of readers gathered by so 
distinctly bookish a periodical as " Literature " 
displays little judgment in its choice, as may 
be seen by an inspection of the following list of 
names, the outcome of a ballot extending over 
several weeks.

Since each participant in this ballot voted for 
ten persons, and the total number of votes is. 
well within one thousand, we are safe in assum- 
ing that about one hundred voters are repre- 
sented. It is a small number, no doubt, but 
little significance need be attached to that fact % 
for had the number of voters been ten or a hun- 
dred times as great, we doubt if the result would 
have been essentially different from that now

recorded. And a glance at that result is enough 
to show its critical worthlessness. 

To substantiate this judgment, let us exam- 
ine the list somewhat in detail. While the 
claim that Mr. Howells is our foremost man of 
letters is not far astray, if at all, it may yet be 
reasonably urged that Mr. Stedinan, who is at 
once our leading poet and our leading critic, is 
even better entitled to head the list. And the 
place of Mr. Stoddard should at least be very 
near the head. The critical ineptitude that 
could set Mr. Riley above Mr. Stoddard, or set 
him anywhere in such a list of twenty, is alone 
sufficient to prove our case. And Mr. Stockton, 
delightful as is his gift of whimsical humor, is 
probably as much surprised as any of his read- 
ers to find himself outranking Mr. James, Mr. 
Harte, and Mr. Stedman, to say nothing of 
half a dozen others. And Mr. Davis, what on 
earth is he doing in this gallery ? Such ab- 
surdities as these, and others almost equally 
glaring, make the list too freakish to deserve 
serious attention. 

For one reason, however, not yet adduced, we 
wish to take it seriously for a moment. Three- 
fourths of the names selected are of poets and 
novelists ; to their company being admitted, by 
way of makeweight, one historian, one natural- 
ist, one old-fashioned essayist, one clergyman of 
letters, and one dramatist. Considered merely 
as a list of poets and novelists, it is conspicu- 
ously defective, for Mr. Gilder, Mr. Eggleston, 
Mr. Crawford, Miss Murfree, and Miss 
Thomas, at least, perhaps several others, count 
for more than some of the writers included. 
But the fatal defect of the list, of course, is to be 
found in its failure to include some of the most 
honored men in American letters, simply be- 
cause they are not primarily novelists or poets. 
We scan the list in vain for the two deans of 
our literary guild, Dr. Hale and Colonel Hig- 
ginson ; we note with absolute amazement the 
absence of the most typical academician we 
have, Mr. Charles Eliot Norton. It is for 
such reasons, rather than for any vagaries of 
ranking, that the list is so distinct an illustra- 
tion of what the membership of our Academy 
ought not to be. 

They do these things much better in the home 
of academies. A few weeks ago, the ranks of 
the French Forty were complete, a condition 
which had not previously obtained for more 
than a score of years. A classification of the 
members showed the following results : eight 
historians, five each of the classes of politicians, 
professors, dramatists, and novelists, four poets, 



two critics, two journalists, one ecclesiastic, one 
lawyer, one sculptor, and one scientist ; in a 
word, nine novelists and poets, thirty-one rep- 
resentatives of other types of intellectual dis- 
tinction. This tells the whole story. We might 
find it difficult to honor so many politicians 
and dramatists, but our Academy, constituted 
in the same spirit, would find places for such 
men as Senator Hoar, Professor William James, 
Mr. E. L. Godkin, Bishop Potter, and Mr. St. 
Gaudens, to take typical examples of the five 
classes absolutely ignored in the list we have 
been considering. It is because no form of 
popular vote would ever, by any possibility, 
single out the men most deserving of this sort 
of distinction that the plebiscite Academy can 
never be anything but a rather bad jest. 



TWO ORDERS OF CRITICS. 

Keats said that one of the three things his time 
afforded for rejoicing was Hazlitt's depth of taste. 
In the enunciation of general principles, the illum- 
ination of dark passages of the mind, Keats was 
himself a better critic than Hazlitt. The sense of 
pleasure in literature and art, and the expression of 
it, is the marked thing in Hazlitt ; the attempt to 
get at the meaning and underlying principles of 
poetry, the characteristic of Keats. Sir Richard 
Steele's saying, that it was a great service one man 
did another to tell him the manner of his being 
pleased, about indicates Hazlitt's achievement. We 
might call this method of criticism the criticism of 
enjoyment ; the other, the criticism of definition. 

When Hazlitt writes a sparkling and vivacious 
character of Millamant, when Walter Pater re- 
paints in words a picture of Leonardo, when Ste. 
Beuve projects on his pages the personalities of 
Cowper or Guerin, they each and all of them ex- 
ercise a minor sort of creative art. They are poets 
themselves or the satellites of poets. They reflect 
a light and heat from their principals, though they 
have little power or vitality of their own. But 
when Aristotle takes his compasses and fixes the 
bounds of the different kinds of poetry ; when 
Lessing defines the provinces of poetry, painting, 
and sculpture ; when Coleridge gives us the distinc- 
tion between imagination and fancy ; or when Ar- 
nold decomposes diction and provides such phrases 
as " natural magic " or " the grand style " to denote 
different qualities of expression, we are confronted 
by another order of critical talent, a kind which 
has none of the half- creative warmth of the first, 
none of its engaging sympathy, but which, never- 
theless, is probably more useful and more permanent. 
The one kind of criticism is qualified by depth of 
taste ; the other, by lucidity of reason. 

I am very far from denying reasoned judgment 
to Hazlitt, or Pater, or Ste. Beuve, or to critics who

share their gifts. They have enough of it to set up 
whole colleges. But it is, I think, a secondary thing 
with them. The main appeal with them is to taste, 
to sympathy. They deal with particulars rather 
than with generals. They are sensitively made to 
respond to excellence in special shapes. They viv- 
idly realize, and compel us to realize, concrete mani- 
festations of beauty or greatness. But we have to 
take them on faith ; their power over us is as of a 
laying on of hands. Hazlitt is perhaps the most 
vivid and various of English Essayists. He said of 
himself that nothing but abstract ideas made any 
impression on him ; but surely he was mistaken 
here. What impressed him most was that figured 
world existent in books and pictures. No one ever 
had a deeper sense of its reality. But when Haz- 
litt tries to think, he is, if not a child, at least a 
very boyish philosopher. No single generalization 
of his is a lamp for one's private feet or a star to 
pilot the world. I must confess to a very moderate 
appetite for Pater's books. His style so sweet, so 
cloying, so sticky is not for me. Yet he has sub- 
tle gifts of discrimination and definition. His re- 
marks as to the architectural necessities of style, 
and about the quality of soul in style, are very ad- 
mirably put, if they are not entirely new. And 
there is a web of close reasoning in all his works. 
But his force is elsewhere than in analysis. He is 
a half artist, a half creator. He tries to reproduce 
in prose the cadences of the verse he loves, and he 
tries to re-create with words the forms and colors of 
the statues and paintings that are ever hovering in 
his eye. Ste. Beuve is a library, and to dismiss 
him in a sentence is absurd. Yet I believe his weak- 
ness is akin to that of the two critics I have dis- 
cussed. Dealing with particulars, he is always 
sound ; dealing with generals, he is usually vague 
and unsatisfactory. His basis is the shifting un- 
certain one of taste. We are at sea with him. Every 
direction is a road, and one is as good as another. 
His definition of a classic is a good example of his 
strength and weakness. It is admirably thought out 
on the side of order, elegance, and art ; it fails en- 
tirely on the side of power, inspiration, and person- 
ality. It seems expressly framed to exclude the 
great books of the Bible, Shakespeare, and most of 
the Greeks. A definition is, as it were, a fence. 
A fence is certainly at fault when it leaves almost 
everything of value outside of it. 

The criticism of taste, of enjoyment, is a great 
breeder of fads and fancies and errors ; but it is also 
a propagator of enthusiasms. It seizes upon some 
partial truth and makes a banner of it, and calls the 
cohorts of literature to its back to press to victory. 
The armed camp of opposition awakes, and the strife 
is on that keeps the world of ideas from stagnating. 
The motto on the flag changes every decade : now 
it is the revival of the classics ; now the exploitation 
of the naive and the new ; now realism ; now roman- 
ticism. Great minds liberate themselves in the 
struggle, and do work which probably bears little 
relation to the theories on which it was founded. 



The abstract definitions and distinctions of the other 
kind of criticism do not in any similar degree con- 
tribute to human sociability or literary production. 
When once propounded they are almost as self- 
evident as the axioms of mathematics. Like mathe- 
matical axioms, also, they are apt to be brief, and not 
to depend on literary style for their value. Analyt- 
ical treatises of extent of course exist, such as the 
Poetics of Aristotle, the Laokoon of Leasing, and 
the aesthetic systems fathered by nearly every great 
German philosopher. But pretty nearly all of 
these are represented to the world by a few phrases 
or distinctions which have the validity of laws. Such 
are the Unities of Aristotle, at least the unity of 
action ; Lessing's discovery that poetry is a time- 
art, and painting and sculpture are space-arts, with 
the corollary that description is not a main business 
of poetry ; Schiller's theory of the play origin or 
nature of art ; and so forth. Pregnant phrases 
and sentences which are criticisms of definition have 
been dropped by great writers of all kinds. Such 
authors find their enjoyment in original work, and 
criticism for them is not an affair of pleasure or 
gratified taste, but a problem of guiding principles. 
Shakespeare's " The lunatic, the lover, and the 
poet " is a criticism of definition. So is Lord 
Bacon's description of " historians, compilers, and 
critics" as "takers of second prizes." Shelley's asser- 
tion that " poets are the unacknowledged legislators 
of the world " is one ; and so is De Quincey's sep- 
aration of the literature of knowledge and the lit- 
erature of power. Perhaps the best recent criticism 
of definition is Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton's class- 
ification of poets as those of Relative and of Absolute 
Vision. Perhaps this distinction derives from Cole- 
ridge's eternal object and subject, and it may draw 
something from that famous passage in the " Mod- 
ern Painters " where Ruskin contrasts the sculptor 
who carved the griffin he had seen with the other 
sculptor who merely carved a griffin as he thought 
it ought to be. But Mr. Watts-Dunton's distinction 
is not merely profound it is a good working one. 
It may be objected that the criticism of definition 
has covered the whole ground ; that, like mathe- 
matics or logic, it is nearly a finished business. But 
it has to deal with a subject-matter the produc- 
tions of the human spirit, infinitely more varied than 
numbers or the relations of sentences. And, besides, 
new applications of old principles are always in 
order. We moderns call ourselves the heirs of the 
ages ; and in a measure and in a material way we 
are so. We have huge accumulations of books, and 
art treasures, and the like. But all these posses- 
sions are not in any single man's head, still less in 
the general mind. Every generation comes forward 
full of bounce and confidence, and with an unim- 
paired fund of original ignorance. It does not know 
anything about literature or art, but it knows what 
it likes. It has a taste, the taste of the age. It is 
a serious objection to the theories of heredity and 
evolution, that the idea of excellence is not progres- 
sive in the human mind. Have our grandfathers

labored for nothing, that our heads are so unfur- 
nished? Sir Francis Galton says, if I remember 
rightly, that as the modern Englishman is to the 
Hottentot so was the Athenian of the best period to 
the modern Englishman. Man's faculty of forget- 
ting is as miraculous as his gift of memory. And 
so it happens that in art and literature and criticism 
we are all the time beginning anew. This newness 
of impulse and experience is a fine thing. In bustle 
and change is production. The literature of every 
age must be a record of what that age has experi- 
enced, not necessarily in action alone, but in thought 
and fancy. Yet there are things also which are 
enduring, and the best criticism will not allow the 
taste of the age to be imposed upon it, but will rather 
seek to impose upon the age the long-tested precepts

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A PHILISTINE VIEW OF POETRY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

How to reply to the " Philister " who in your last issue 
attacks the manhood of the poet, and be both truthful 
and parliamentary at the same time, is not an easy mat- 
ter, so wholly unfounded is every leading statement he 
makes. With prefatory apologies for a series of flat 
contradictions, let me then say: That the reviewer of 
recently published verse in " The Nation " should find 
better poems from women than from men is surprising 
and purely adventitious. It is so unusual that it 
probably never happened before, and it may never hap- 
pen again. There are now an average of ten volumes 
of original verse being published every week in the En- 
glish-speaking world about five hundred every year. 
Of these, not less than fifty deserve to be read by all 
who know and love literature in its highest form of ex- 
pression; and of these fifty, about forty are written by 
men. Women are not holding their own in poetical ex- 
pression are making nothing like the impression in 
poetry that they are making in almost every other 
department of the world of letters, particularly in 
romance and essay writing. Any magazine almost 
any newspaper should convince " Philister " that there 
were never so many persons struggling for poetic fame, 
and that the proportion of men among them was never 
so large as now. It is true that the poetry of most men 
does not " pay " in the monetary sense ; but that is an 
advantage which almost no other department of litera- 
ture enjoys, and its effects are rather favorable than 
otherwise, as the growing body of beautiful English 
verse abundantly attests. 

The notion that there is " something unmanly, or un- 
masculine, in the make-up of a poet" is neither " old," 
"lurking," nor "popular," nor is it "gaining ground." 
There is a feeling among English-speaking persons 
whose associations are remote from cultivated society 
that all artists are in some way reprehensible ; but these 
folk set all forms of enjoyment for enjoyment's sake in 
the same category, notably athletic exercise. This feel- 
ing, which is no older than puritanism, is frowned upon 
by everyone pretending to civilization, and is losing 
ground along with other forms of illiteracy. There has 



never been a time, from Homer to Browning and Tenny- 
son, when the poet was not worshipped in the old sense 
of the word by intellect and cultivation; and though 
we are to-day in a sort of poetical interregnum, many 
men now writing will attain undoubted worship of the 
same sort. Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman, one of the 
most respected men of business in Wall street, and a 
manly and virile writer of manly and virile poems (and 
essays as well), had occasion to say a few months ago 
that many Americans who have put forth poems within 
the last fifteen years would have achieved eminence 
had they written earlier; Mr. J. Churton Collins has 
said the same for the Englishman, and Mr. William 
Sharp for the Celt: and it is a truism to anyone who 
knows contemporaneous verse. This verse is conspic- 
uously robust; and one must have queer notions of ef- 
feminacy who thinks Tennyson, Browning, Meredith, 
Lowell, Stedman, Stoddard, and a score more of our 
modern " man-poets," are " effeminate " ! There are 
even in your correspondent's own Kansas City a number 
of men now striving earnestly and manfully for poetic 
reputation; and it is conceivable that the residents of 
that Missouri metropolis might be as willing to go down 
to fame as the townsmen of these poets, as to draw an 
example from " practical " life of those virile men of 
business who canned " roast " beef for the American 
soldiers during the recent war.

IS THE "MAN-POET" PASSING? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am not a poet nor the son of a poet, so that any 
remarks that follow are not prompted by the " pinch of 
the shoe." Your contributor, in his communication (is- 
sue of May 16) on " The Passing of the Man-Poet," 
seems for some reason to have swung to an extreme of 
cynicism, and it occurred to me that possibly the " pinch " 
was on the foot of " Philister " himself. But the West- 
ern city from which he writes would hardly be favor- 
able to the production of " a big, brawny, bearded he- 
creature like Tennyson . . . chirping about ' Airy, fairy 
Lilian ' "; no, that would be expecting too much. Per- 
haps we should not be disappointed if we sought there 
for men of the class to which "Mr. Dooley" belongs: 
men who represent the contributor's idea of the incar- 
nation of the practical tendencies of our age; men who 
can talk politics over the bar, and make occasional re- 
marks that are commented upon by even " Cousin 
George " Dewey. Yes,/m de siecle common-sense, and 
plenty of it the kind that thinks poetry should be 
given over to women because of a lurking popular no- 
tion that " there is something unmanly, or unmasculine, 
in the make-up of a poet" such common-sense is doubt- 
less what would most richly reward a searcher in that 
city. Your contributor would have us believe that men, 
manly men, in this age must yield to vulgar notions about 
matters of art. Granting for a moment that this notion 
about poets has a real existence, is it not true that there 
is a popular notion about painters and artists in general 
similar to that about poets ? Suppose that this lurking 
popular notion were allowed to grow into a prejudice 
strong enough to put down men who are burning with 
the divine flame of artistic inspiration: we should cer- 
tainly have an age prosaic indeed. But this is just what 
" Philister " says we are now coming to except for the 
poetry of women. Though it could be done, it is not 
our purpose to take the time and space to produce an

array of facts showing that some of the best poetry of 
the age is written by men; manly men, who are not 
ashamed that they write poetry. The opinion of the 
reviewer in " The Nation " is the opinion of an individual 
who had a pile of books on his table, among which (and 
he probably did not read all of them) he thought the best 
parts were written by women ; he is seconded in his opin- 
ion by " Philister ": two opinions make the passing of the 
man-poet ! In all previous literature, two great, really 
great, women-poets have appeared: Sappho and Mrs. 
Browning. The great men-poets are almost numberless. 
Is the ratio to be reversed at once ? 

But possibly your contributor did not intend his com- 
munication to be taken seriously. If he did not, he has 
allowed his cynicism to carry him too far. He not only 
does not encourage the writing of poetry by men, but 
he contemptuously discourages it; and he discourages 
not only the writing of poetry, but indirectly all forms 
of artistic endeavor that do not exactly coincide with 
popular notions. What cynics say must usually be taken 
with due allowance for the cynical mood. And so we 
should doubtless take what is said by " Philister."

THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

I wish with all my heart to congratulate THE DIAL 
on its spirited defense of the genuine American prin- 
ciple of freedom of speech. The Republic of Letters 
has no room for the official censor, and to be safe within 
its own domain it must at all times maintain its Monroe 
Doctrine of letters, forbidding the encroachment of the 
monarchical principle of censorship even upon the neigh- 
boring realm of political discussion. The man who does 
not see that the attack upon Mr. Atkinson threatens 
literature itself has simply failed to follow the matter 
to its logical end. One of the great powers across the 
sea has been imprisoning men of the type of Mr. Atkin- 
son about as fast as they have appeared during recent 
years, but it has also included men of the type of the 
author of " Mr. Dooley." Granting the premises on 
which it imprisons the one, it is perfectly logical in 
including the other. Our own authorities stop where 
they do, not because they have a logical stopping-place, 
but because they fear the people at the polls. They 
will go further if the people show themselves satisfied 
with the first step. It has already been hinted from 
Washington that the same censorship might be applied 
at home, if deemed desirable in the future, and that 
Mr. Atkinson might possibly be subjected to a criminal 
prosecution. Now, with conditions as they are, the 
press is liable to bring forth at any time a comedy on 
some such theme as " The Genesis of an Empire," before 
the effective sarcasm of which the heat of the authori- 
ties would wax much greater than before the Massa- 
chusetts pamphleteer. The material is at hand for such 
a play, and every city of size in the Union would have 
a fine audience at hand for it. If it should come, would 
it be prohibited as seditious ? 

The country is strong enough, and ought to be intel- 
ligent enough, to rise above persecution for opinion's 
sake, whether that persecution be through the press and 
platform, or the Postoffice Department and the Federal 
courts. Imperialism can furnish no satisfactory return 
for the sacrifice of the principles of free speech.

KNAPP'S LIFE OF GEORGE BORROW.* 

In point of documental richness, Dr. Knapp's 
Life of that eccentric man and original writer, 
George Borrow, should prove a pleasant sur- 
prise to even sanguine Borrovians. So far as 
we now know, the only noteworthy omission in 
this kind is the sheaf of newly discovered let- 
ters of Borrow to the Bible Society ; and one is 
almost glad, out of sympathy with Dr. Knapp, 
who has been at such immense pains to ferret 
out every shred and scrap of writing necessary 
to the completeness of his collection, to learn 
that the new " find " is of no special intrinsic 
importance. Dr. Knapp's plan has been to 
allow the original writings to speak for them- 
selves wherever feasible. His book may there- 
fore be defined as in the main a mosaic of 
documents relating to Borrow, so arranged, 
explained and supplemented as to give the care- 
ful reader a tolerably clear idea of what the 
real Borrow really was and did. Not that Dr. 
Knapp has essayed the impossible task of re- 
ducing George Borrow to the humdrum level 
of commonplace humanity, or the ungrateful 
one of proving him to have been, for all his 
mystic assumptions and bravura airs, a mere 
poseur and exploiter of human gullibility, of 
the Cagliostro or George Psalmanazar stripe. 
On the contrary, Dr. Knapp inclines to take 
Borrow, except as to his linguistic attainments, 
pretty much at his own valuation. " Laven- 
gro " he accepts as substantially an autobiog- 
raphy which of course it is, although, as 
Borrow put it, " in Robinson Crusoe style." 
Perhaps we shall not go far wrong if we regard 
that extraordinary book, and its sequel " Ro- 
many Rye," as reflecting the life and adven- 
tures of George Borrow as seen through the 
prism of George Sorrow's imagination. Let 
us glance at this remarkable life in outline, 
with the aid of the dry light of Dr. Knapp's 
researches. 

George Henry Borrow, born at East Dere- 
ham, Norfolk, July 5, 1803, was the younger 
son of Captain Thomas Borrow, an athletic 
Cornishman of good family, and Ann Perfre- 
rnent, a Norfolk woman of French Huguenot 
extraction. Ann Perfrement, prior to her mar- 
riage, was an actress of small parts at Dereham

Theatre. Captain Borrow rose from the ranks. 
He had " taken the Queen's shilling " to evade 
arrest as ringleader and chief combatant in a 
rural riot, in the course of which he had sig- 
nalized his known prowess by knocking down 
a score or so of people, including a peace offi- 
cer. Captain Sorrow's puissant fists were 
much in evidence throughout his career. He 
won fame as the conqueror of the celebrated 
bruiser, " Big Ben," in a Homeric combat in 
Hyde Park ; and he must have wept for joy 
to hear of his son's immortal victory over the 
" Flaming Tinman." These facts about the elder 
Borrow are noted as partly accounting for the 
pugilistic bent of his gifted son, who was much 
given to the ways and company of " the fancy," 
who attended many a " merry mill " in the 
days of his vagrom youth, who celebrated in 
manly prose the deeds of Spring, Cribb, Oli- 
ver, Painter, and Molineaux, and who was him- 
self, in his prime, second to few men in England 
in the use of nature's weapons. " Don Jorge " 
(who must have distributed " apostolic blows 
and knocks " almost as freely as Bibles in 
Spain) thus summed up in rhyme his youthful 
gifts and attainments : 

" A lad who twenty tongues can talk, 
And sixty miles a day can walk ; 
Drink at a draught a pint of rum, 
And then be neither sick nor][dumb ; 
Can tune a song or make a verse, 
And deeds of Northern kings rehearse ; 
Who never will forsake his friend 
While he his bony fist can bend ; 
And, though averse to brawl and strife, 
Will fight a Dutchman with a knife ; 
Oh, that is just the lad for me, 
And such is honest six-foot-three." 

George Borrow's regular schooling (there 
was not much of it) was had at Edinburgh 
High School, and latterly at Norwich Gram- 
mar School, where he slighted his set tasks, 
and plunged ardently into the study of the Ko- 
mance languages under such chance tutorship 
as offered itself. At Norwich he led an irreg- 
ular life, quite in the Lavengro way, consorting 
much with bruisers, strollers, horse-dealers, and 
other loose fish, including Thurtell, who after- 
wards murdered .William Weare,* and was 
hanged at Hertford in 1824, as Borrow's other 
crony, David Haggart, had been hanged at 
Edinburgh in 1821. Queer beginnings these 
for the future translator and disseminator of 
the Gospel ! It is difficult to acquit young 
Borrow of a taste for bad, or at least loose, 

* " His throat they cut from ear to ear 

His brains they battered in ; 
His name was Mr. William Weare, 
He lived in Lyon's Inn." Old Song. 



company, though in his case it sprang from an 
overflow of animal vigor and an inborn impa- 
tience of restraint and convention. High- 
mettled youth is apt to confound the lawless 
and vicious with the spirited and romantic, until 
experience and reflection come to its aid. No 
man could be morally sounder at the core than 
was George Borrow ; and, after all, these grimy 
doings and grimier companionships of his un- 
regenerate youth were grist for the mill of the 
future Lavengro. What Borrovian regrets 
them ? Another of Borrow's Norwich friends 
was scholarly, free- thinking, loose-living Will- 
iam Taylor, whose precept and example did 
him no good. At Norwich, too, his old gypsy 
friend Jasper Petulengro (now " orphaned " 
through the transportation of his worthy pa- 
rents) again turned up ; and many and weird 
were the dialogues of the twain on lonely 
Household Heath, where the wind blew, and 
the stars shone, and " Mr. Petulengro " devel- 
oped his truly great theory of the beauty and 
the delight of life. 

In 1819 Borrow was articled for five years 
to a firm of solicitors at Norwich, with whom 
he, naturally, learned little law, and a vast 
amount of matter that had nothing at all to do 
with law. He had formerly studied Latin, 
Greek, Irish, French, Italian, Spanish, and 
English-Gypsy ; he now began Welsh, Danish, 
German, Hebrew, Arabic, Gaelic, and Arme- 
nian as if he meant to rise superior to the 
curse of the builders of Babel. It is needless 
to say that Borrow's knowledge of tongues was 
always and at best wide rather than deep. In 
point of quantity he was, as Dr. Knapp says, 
" prodigious " (at the age of twenty he is re- 
ported to have " translated with facility and 
elegance twenty different languages "), and, as 
to quality, he was undoubtedly considerably 
more than the mere smatterer. But it is not 
on his scholarship, but on his remarkable style 
as a writer of English prose from 1841 to 1862, 
that his reputation rests. 

In 1821 Borrow met Sir John Bowring, then 
engaged in translating his way into public office 
and emoluments, and at once " fell into the 
translation snare." Bowring, a shrewd man, 
regarded translating merely as a stepping- 
stone to office, and he throve accordingly ; 
poor Borrow, on the contrary, regarded it as a 
life-absorbing work that would yield him fame 
and a competence. For ten years of mortifi- 
cation and poverty he was under this delusion, 
translating into English rhyme Welsh (" ten 
thousand lines of Ab Gwilym " !), Danish, and

German, and hunting a market for his indif- 
ferent and unsalable wares. Sorrow's father 
died in 1824, and in that year his term in the 
solicitor's office expired. So he packed up his 
precious versions of " Faustus," the " Ancient 
Songs of Denmark," and the everlasting " Ab 
Gwilym," and set out for London, eager to 
" begin" Then came a long season of poorly 
paid and unpaid pen-drudgery, casual gypsy- 
ing, actual want, of " drifting on the sea of 
the world " and of " digging holes in the sand 
and filling them up again," as Borrow mourn- 
fully put it, which we may pass over. These 
years included that mysterious " veiled period " 
of seven years, which Borrow hints were spent 
in " roving adventure " in distant countries, 
but which Dr. Knapp prosaically concludes 
were mainly passed between London and Nor- 
wich in " doing common work for booksellers " 
and earning the indispensable modicum of 
daily bread. It was George Borrow's humor 
to mystify, and he was quite willing his ad- 
mirers should infer from his vague hints that 
this really commonplace and squalid interim of 
eclipse in his " Robinson Crusoe " autobiog- 
raphy was spent in romantic wanderings and 
strange, nay unhallowed, enterprises in the 
Orient, over which it were well to drop the veil. 
Dr. Knapp assigns as Borrow's two leading 
principles : 

" (1) What was disastrous in his career was carefully 
concealed, and the proofs (he thought) destroyed. (2) 
The secrets thus obliterated were treasured up, and 
duly reappear in his writings under other names and 
characters, more or less distorted to evade detection 
and interpretation. A third might be added, viz. that 
he never created a character, and that the originals are 
easily recognizable to one who thoroughly knows his 
times and his writings." 

Borrow gave up the fight in London in 1830, 
and returned to Norwich, where he tarried three 
years, still " digging holes in the sand and fill- 
ing them up again." Just how the wind was 
tempered to him at this time does not clearly 
appear, and we find his artist brother John 
(equally in the dark it seems) writing him 
from Mexico, " You never tell me what you 
are doing ; you can't be living on nothing." 
This brother, who was of a practical turn, first 
recommended the army (for, he cheerfully 
urged, " you would make a good grenadier "), 
then " sticking to the law "; and he once ob- 
served, with considerable truth, " I am con- 
vinced that your want of success in life is more 
owing to your being unlike other people than 
to any other cause." Thus was the very qual- 
ity, by virtue of which in the main George 



Borrow lives and grows in the minds of men 
to-day, sincerely deplored. 

At last, in 1833, the dawn came. George 
Borrow's hitherto burdensome acquirements 
were to be turned to profitable account. The 
British and Foreign Bible Society happened to 
need an agent versed in Eastern languages to 
superintend the printing at St. Petersburg of 
a Manchu translation of the New Testament ; 
and Borrow was recommended by Mr. Gurney 
of Norwich as precisely the man for the work. 
The preliminary bargain was promptly struck 
much to the amusement of respectable Nor- 
wich, which laughed consumedly to think of 
the quondam chum of Thurtell and disciple of 
godless " Billy " Taylor thus suddenly con- 
verted into an instrument for saving the 
heathen. Says Miss Martineau : 

" When this polyglott gentleman appeared before the 
public as a devout agent of the Bible Society in foreign 
parts, there was one burst of laughter from all who re- 
membered the old Norwich days." 

But it was to be " the devout agent," and 
not Norwich " gigmanity," who laughed last. 
Borrow spent his stipulated six months in 
studying Manchu-Tartar, then passed the Soci- 
ety's competitive examination brilliantly, and, 
on July 31, 1833, started for Russia. Dr. 
Knapp's chapters on the Russian mission show 
Borrow in a new light. His duties were ardu- 
ous (the entire conduct of the business in hand 
fell upon him), and he performed them with a 
tact, zeal, and practical " push " that surprised 
and delighted his employers. The Government 
imprimatur secured, which was no small task 
to begin with, Borrow contracted for his mate- 
rial, engaged his printers, taught them to set 
the strange type, bullied, bribed, or cajoled 
them back to their work when they went " on 
strike," battled successfully with the thousand- 
and-one difficulties of red-tapeism, ignorance, 
and human wrong-headedness that daily beset 
him, and, in September, 1835, had his whole 
edition of one thousand copies of the Manchu 
Scriptures ready for use. He had also, largely 
with his own hands, cleansed, separated, and 
generally repaired an abandoned font of Man- 
chu type which had been apparently ruined in 
the disastrous inundation of the Neva ten years 
before. The stipulated work done, Borrow 
astounded the Committee with the " noble 
offer " to himself distribute his Bibles in the 
benighted regions of the then dim and myste- 
rious Far East. In his own words, he " would 
wander, Testament in hand, overland to Pe- 
king," by way of Lake Baikal and Kiakhta,

" with side-glances at Tartar hordes." This 
scheme, long seriously considered by the Soci- 
ety, in the end came to naught ; but, says Dr. 
Knapp slyly, " Borrow always believed that he 
went to Kiakhta, China, and over the East, 
and so did the readers of his books." When 
it came to his repute as a traveller, George 
Borrow never stood in his own light. 

Of the details of Sorrow's colportage in 
Spain, nothing need be said here. Dr. Knapp 
tells us not much that is new in this connec- 
tion, but he throws some light on what has 
been doubtful. It was evidently more due to 
the unfavorable change in Spanish politics in 
1838, than to differences with his principals at 
home, that Borrow's work in Spain was dis- 
continued. Such a mission as his could not 
flourish under a reactionary regime. How he, 
his work, and his immortal book, appeared in 
orthodox Spanish eyes, is manifest in the fol- 
lowing passage from the " History of Religious 
Dissent in Spain " by Don Menendez Pelayo : 

" The first emissary of these Societies was a Quaker 
by the name of George Borrow, a hoity-toity indi- 
vidual of little learning and less wit, and with a large 
amount of gullibility. Borrow wrote a most absurdly 
grotesque book on his travels in Spain, of which we 
might say as of Tirante el Blanco, that it is a ' storehouse 
of amusement and a mine of diversion ' a book, in 
fine, capable of exciting roars of laughter in the most 
ascetic of readers." 

The laughter of Don Menendez himself over 
Borrow's account of his countrymen does not 
appear to have been of the mirthful and jocund 
order. 

Borrow's marriage to Mrs. Clarke, in 1840, 
put an end to his wanderings and his vagrant- 
ism, gave him a comfortable home in England, 
and the leisure he needed for his real work in 
life. Of his wife he contentedly, if unroman- 
tically, writes, in " Wild Wales," that she is a 
"perfect paragon of wives can make puddings 
and sweets and treacle posset, and is the best 
woman of business in Eastern Anglia." Evi- 
dently Lavengro was in a snug harbor at last. 
The pair settled down at Oulton Cottage, 
Lowestoft, where Borrow proceeded to finish 
the " Gypsies of Spain," his first original book, 
the dutiful " paragon of wives " acting as aman- 
uensis. The gipsying, tinkering days of the 
wind-swept heath and the roadside dingle were 
gone indeed but their memory, as we know, 
loomed tinged and softened through the mists 
of time. The " Gypsies " was duly finished and 
submitted to Murray, as Dr. Smiles relates : 

"In November, 1840, a tall athletic gentleman in 
black called upon Mr. Murray, offering a MS. for pe- 



rusal and publication. Mr. Murray could not fail to 
be taken at first sight with this extraordinary man. He 
had a splendid physique, standing six feet two in bis 
stockings, and he had brains as well as muscles, as his 
works sufficiently show." 

The " Gypsies " was published in April, 
1841, and succeeded fairly well. Then came 
" The Bible in Spain " (substantially a mosaic 
of the author's letters to the Bible Society), 
issued in December, 1842, which at once took 
the reading and the reviewing world by storm. 
In England the sales far outran the hopes of 
author and publisher. As to America (alas !), 
the two works were printed at New York and 
Philadelphia " in tens of thousands," " by three 
rival houses "; and from these sales, we learn, 
George Borrow " derived nothing " ! The 
wronged man wrote to his wife : 

" A letter appeared last Saturday in the 'Athenseum ' 
which states that an edition of thirty thousand copies 
has just been brought out in America. I really never 
heard of anything so infamous." 

Let us congratulate ourselves that our law- 
makers have now shown signs of a dawning or 
rudimentary conscience in respect of the rights 
of the foreign author. 

The origin, progress, and character of " La- 
vengro " are satisfactorily indicated in Dr. 
Knapp's copious extracts from Borrow's corre- 
spondence. The book was " on the stocks " 
virtually before the " Bible " was issued. On 
October 2, 1843, Borrow wrote to Murray : 

" The book I am at present about, will consist of a 
series of Rembrandt pictures interspersed here and there 
with a Claude. I shall tell the world of my parentage, 
iny early thoughts, and habits; how I became a sapengro, 
or viper-catcher; my wanderings with the regiment in 
England, Scotland, and Ireland, in which latter place 
my jockey habits first commenced. Then a great deal 
about Norwich, Billy Taylor, Thurtell, etc., etc. ; how I 
took to study and became a lav-engro.* . . . Whenever 
the book comes out it will be a rum one." 

A " rum one " it was, in all conscience, 
too " rum " for the wiseacres of the reviews, 
who shook their sapient heads at it, and con- 
demned it with scarcely a dissenting voice. 
Borrow, of course, was furious, and laid about 
him like an angry bull tormented by a swarm 
of gnats. In the preface to a later edition he 
declared that he had had the honor of being 
rancorously abused " by every unmanly scoun- 
drel, every sycophantic lacquey, and every po- 
litical and religious renegade in Britain f"; and 
in his Appendix he truculently held up his 
critics, " blood and foam streaming from their 

* Word- master. 

t These were the words of the autograph original. Murray 
judiciously softened them into : " by the very people of whom 
the country has least reason to be proud."

jaws." Sorrow's abuse of his censors was of 
course as ill-judged and ineffectual as was their 
dispraise of his book. No author, as somebody 
observes, was ever permanently written down 
(or, let us add, written up) by anyone but 
himself ; and time is verifying Dr. Hake's pre- 
diction that " ' Lavengro's ' roots will strike 
deep into the soil of English letters." 

But we must now take leave of Dr. Knapp's 
valuable book. After the death, in 1869, of 
Borrow's wife, the course of his life ran un- 
eventfully and drearily to the end. The old 
fitful hypochondria dogged his closing years ; 
and the " Romany Rye " died alone in the 
more melancholy sense of the word, as there is 
reason to believe at Oulton, on July 26, 
1881. Soon afterward the cottage was pulled 
down and the grounds were modernized ; but 
the summer-house where " Lavengro " was 
written still stands among the trees a shrine 
for Borrovian pilgrims. 

On the score of style, Dr. Knapp's book can- 
not in candor be praised ; but it is on the whole 
a noteworthy and useful performance, for which 
students of Borrow especially will be thankful.

LOWELL, AND HIS FRIENDS.* 



Dr. Edward Everett Hale has drunk deep 
from the Fountain of Youth ; for, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that he wants but a few years of 
attaining to the dignity of an octogenarian, 
he still writes with all the vigor of the happy 
prime of manhood. Not all his years and labors 
have exhausted his inventiveness. His work is 
still characterized by the features which distin- 
guished it years ago. It is marked by the 
same genial humor, the same wholesome optim- 
ism, the same sound sense ; and the charm of 
his style with its ease, its simplicity, its seem- 
ing disregard of method is as fascinating as 
ever. He is still the supreme master of the 
material in which he works. 

In his latest work, " James Russell Lowell 
and his Friends," his object, he reminds us, 
was not so much to give a history of Lowell's 
life as " to show the circumstances which sur- 
rounded his life and which account for the 
course of it." Here certainly, there was need 
of a supreme master of material, for the friends 
Lowell made in the course of his many-sided 
career were legion, and a less gifted author

than Dr. Hale might easily have been led to 
say too much. That Dr. Hale has not said too 
much, goes without saying. In an age gone 
mad with the ungovernable desire of sweeping 
up the chips of every author's literary work- 
shop and of displaying these worthless frag- 
ments to the gaze of the public, it is refreshing 
to come across such a book as this, for the self- 
restraint which the author has shown in exclud- 
ing from his book all that was not absolutely 
essential is as admirable as it is unusual. 
Added to this there was the intimate personal 
knowledge of the men and manners described, 
which has enabled Dr. Hale to reproduce the 
life of the time the thoughts, the feelings, 
and the actions of these men of whom he him- 
self was an associate. The result of all this is 
that, no matter what period of Lowell's life we 
follow whether it be his childhood and boy- 
hood at Elmwood, his undergraduate days at 
Harvard, his rustication to Concord, his asso- 
ciations in Boston in the forties, his inner com- 
panionship with the young men and women 
known respectively as " The Club " and " The 
Band," his entrance upon a career of letters, 
his experiences as public speaker and editor, 
his professorship at Harvard or his connection 
with politics and war, his ministry in Spain 
and England or his last years in the Elmwood 
of his youth no one can rise from the perusal 
of this book without feeling that he has learned 
to know Lowell as a man better than ever be- 
fore, that he has come to regard Lowell with 
something of the affection that most people 
bestow upon Longfellow, and that of all men 
living Dr. Hale was the one best fitted to bring 
us to an appreciation of the really loveable side 
of Lowell's character. 

It would be manifestly impossible, in the 
space of a brief article, to give the reader any 
adequate idea of Dr. Bale's treatment of the 
several phases of Lowell's life, unless we were 
to select some one or two for special considera- 
tion. Perhaps the two most interesting por- 
tions of his book are the chapters dealing with 
Harvard during Lowell's undergraduate days, 
and with Boston in the forties, just as Lowell 
was entering upon his literary career. 

When Lowell entered Harvard in 1834 
to follow Dr. Hale's account that institution 
was what we should now call an Academy. 
There were some two hundred and fifty stu- 
dents, most of whom were between the ages of 
sixteen and twenty-two ; and these gave their 
days and nights when they were studiously 
inclined to the study of Latin, Greek, and

mathematics. On three days of the week, 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, teachers of 
modern languages appeared, and everyone not 
a freshman was obliged to choose some one of 
these languages and pursue it for four terms. 
When the student came to count up his credits, 
however, a modern language was worth only 
half as much as a classical language. Later in 
his career the student read rhetoric, logic, moral 
philosophy, political economy, chemistry, and 
natural history. There was at that time no 
study of English literature, although excellent 
drill was had in writing the English language. 
A day in the older Harvard was a rather dull 
affair. You attended morning and evening 
prayers in the chapel, half the year at six in 
the morning and six in the evening, or, when 
the days shortened, as late as half-past seven in 
the morning and as early as quarter past four 
in the afternoon. After morning prayers you 
went to the class-rooms and recited your lessons. 
The rest of the day you spent in the library, 
or reading and studying in your own room. 
In Lowell's undergraduate days, Josiah Quin- 
cey was president of the college the man who 
had been a leader of the old Federalists in 
Congress, who had opposed Eandolph and Jef- 
ferson, and who, like Socrates, believed he had 
a " Daimon " to direct him. Fortunately for 
Lowell, Edward Tyrrel Channing, one of those 
great teachers who have an individuality to im- 
press upon their students, was then a member 
of the Faculty, and to him, says Dr. Hale, was 
due the English of Emerson, Holmes, Sumner, 
Clarke, Bellows, Lowell, Higginson, and other 
men who came under his training. And if one 
stops to think of it what a tribute this is ! 
When Longfellow came to Cambridge in 1836, 
he inaugurated a sort of renaissance in modern 
continental literature. He was fresh from study 
in Europe* he came from Bowdoin thus show- 
ing the Cambridge undergraduates that accom- 
plished men could be trained outside of Harvard 
and he was already known as a man of let- 
ters. At that time the atmosphere of Harvard 
was distinctly a literary one ; and Longfellow's 
arrival made it more so. Dr. Hale says that 
the books which the fellows took from the col- 
lege library, and those they bought for their 
own subscription libraries, were books of liter- 
ature that is, " mere " literature. One of 
the books seen everywhere, for instance, was a 
volume printed in Philadelphia, containing the 
poems of Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats. We 
are told that Emerson's copy of Tennyson's first 
volume of poems passed eagerly from hand to 



hand, and that Carlyle's books were purchased 
and read as fast as they appeared. Three or 
four literary societies helped to foster this love 
of literature, as did also the Alpha Delta Phi 
when it was founded. The truth seems to be 
that if the fellows did dabble in anything be- 
sides literature, they were very like to show an 
indifference splendidly illustrated by one of 
Dr. Hale's anecdotes. He says : 

" In the year 1840, 1 was at West Point for the first 
time, with William Story, Lowell's classmate and friend, 
and with Story's sister and mine. We enjoyed to the 
full the matchless hospitality of West Point, seeing its 
lions under the special care of two young officers of our 
own age. They had just finished their course, as we had 
recently finished ours at Harvard. One day when Story 
and I were by ourselves, after we had been talking of 
our studies with these gentlemen, Story said to me: 
' Ned, it is all very well to keep a stiff upper lip with 
these fellows, but how did you dare tell them that we 
studied about projectiles at Cambridge ? ' 

" Because we did,' said I. 

"'Did I ever study projectiles ? ' asked Story, puzzled. 

" ' Certainly you did,' said I. You used to go up to 
Peirce Tuesday and Thursday afternoons in the summer 
when you were a junior, with a blue book which had a 
white back.' 

"'I know I did,' said Story; 'and I was studying 
projectiles then ? This is the first time I ever heard 
of it.' " 

Not five of the fellows, says Dr. Hale, saw a 
daily newspaper, and the isolation from the 
world outside of Cambridge and Boston was 
well nigh complete. Even as late as 1860, the 
men at Harvard paid little attention to what 
was going on elsewhere, a fact made clear by 
the story which follows. The accuracy of this 
story has been questioned, but Dr. Hale says 
he has taken care to verify all its details. 

" One of Lowell's fellow professors told me this curi- 
ous story, which will illustrate the narrowness of New 
England observation at that time. There appeared at 
Cambridge in the year 1860 a young gentleman named 
Robert Todd Lincoln, who ... is quite well known in 
this country and England. This young man wished to 
enter Harvard College, and his father, one Abraham 
Lincoln, who has since been known in the larger world, 
had fortified him with a letter of introduction to Dr. 
Walker, the president of the college. This letter of 
introduction was given by one Stephen A. Douglas, who 
was a person also then quite well known in political life, 
and he presented the young man to Dr. Walker as being 
the son of his friend Abraham Lincoln, ' with whom I 
have lately been canvassing the State of Illinois.' When 
this letter, now so curious in history, was read, Lowell 
said to my friend who tells me the story, ' I suppose I 
am the only man in this room who has ever heard of 
this Abraham Lincoln; but he is the person with whom 
Douglas has been traveling up and down in Illinois, 
canvassing the State in their new Western fashion, as 
representatives of the two parties, each of them being 
the candidate for the vacant seat in the Senate.' What 
is more, my friend says it is probably true that at the 
moment when this letter was presented by young Robert 



1899.]

Lincoln, none of the faculty of Harvard College, ex- 
cepting Lowell, had ever heard of Abraham Lincoln. 
The story is a good one, as showing how far it was in 
those days possible for a circle of intelligent men to 
know little or nothing of what was happening in the 
world beyond the sound of their college bell." 

So much for Harvard. Dr. Hale begins his 
account of Boston in the forties with the state- 
ment that he despairs of making anyone appre- 
ciate the ferment in the life of Boston at that 
time. However that may be, he has assuredly 
written a most entertaining account. Boston 
was then a town where everybody knew pretty 
nearly everbody else, he says, and where, as 
someone said, "You could go anywhere in ten 
minutes." Most of the people were of the old 
Puritan stock, who " lived to the glory of God " 
and who " believed in the infinite capacity of 
human nature." Whatever they did, they did 
on a generous scale and as if confident of suc- 
cess. Boston, in fact, " became the headquar- 
ters for New England, and in a measure for the 
country, of every sort of enthusiasm, not to 
say of every sort of fanaticism. . . . There 
was not an ' ism ' but had its shrine, nor a cause 
but had its prophet." 

Those were the days, too, of " The Five of 
Clubs," known also as the " Mutual Admira- 
tion Society," which was composed of Charles 
Sumner and his law partner, George Stillman 
Hillard; H. W. Longfellow; Cornelius Con way 
Felton, professor of Greek at Harvard and 
afterwards president of the college ; and H. R. 
Cleveland. Here is the story of an epigram 
which the Club made upon " In Memoriam ": 
" The firm, then Ticknor & Fields, were Tennyson's 
American publishers. They had just brought out ' In 
Memoriam.' One of the five gentlemen looked in as he 
went down town, took up the book, and said, Tennyson 
has done for friendship what Petrarch did for love, Mr. 
Fields,' to which Mr. Fields assented; and his friend 
say Mr. Hillard went his way. Not displeased with 
his own remark when he came to his office if it were 
Hillard he repeated it to Sumner, who in turn repeated 
it to Cleveland, perhaps, when he looked in. Going 
home to lunch, Sumner goes in at the shop, takes up 
the new book, and says, Your Tennyson is out, Mr. 
Fields. What Petrarch did for love, Tennyson has done 
for friendship.' Mr. Fields again assents, and it is half 
an hour before Mr. Cleveland enters. He also is led to 
say that Tennyson has done for friendship what Petrarch 
has done for love; and before the sun sets Mr. Fields 
receives the same suggestion from Longfellow, and then 
from Felton, who have fallen in with their accustomed 
friends, and look in to see the new books, on their way 
out to Cambridge." 

In this same chapter, " Boston in the Forties," 
there is a paragraph about Emerson which is 
worth quoting, partly because it shows how Dr. 
Hale makes use of Lowell's friends to enliven 



his book and partly because it hints at some 
of the practical difficulties Lowell himself had 
to overcome when he adopted a literary career : 
" The truth was that literature was not yet a profes- 
sion. The men who wrote for the ' North American ' 
were earning their bread and butter, their sheets, blan- 
kets, fuel, broadcloth, shingles, and slates in other en- 
terprises. Emerson was an exception; and perhaps the 
impression as to his being crazy was helped by the 
observation that these ' things which perish in the using ' 
came to him in the uncanny and unusual channel of 
literary workmanship. Even Emerson printed in the 
' North American Review ' lectures which had been 
delivered elsewhere. He told me in 1849, after he had 
returned from England, that he had then never received 
a dollar from the sale of any of his own published works. 
He said he owned a great many copies of his own books, 
but that these were all the returns which he had received 
from his publishers. And Mr. Phillips told me that 
when, after ' English Traits,' published by him, had in 
the first six months' sales paid for its plates and earned 
a balance besides in Emerson's favor, Emerson could 
not believe this. He came to the office to explain to 
Mr. Phillips that he wanted and meant to hold the 
property in his own stereotype plates. And Mr. Phil- 
lips had difficulty in persuading him that he had already 
paid for them and did own them. Emerson was then 
so unused to the methods of business that Mr. Phillips 
had also to explain to him how to indorse the virgin 
check, so that he could place it at his own bank account." 

Perhaps these passages will suffice to show at 
least the entertaining character of this work. 
While not all the passages here quoted bear 
directly upon Lowell's life, it should be re- 
marked that the reader is never allowed to for- 
get that Lowell is the central figure of this 
biography. Each period of his life is treated 
with a true sense of the proportion due it, 
although the chief object of the work, as already 
stated, was rather to show Lowell's environ- 
ment and the extent to which his life and char- 
acter were the products of that environment. 
The pleasure of tracing with Dr. Hale the 
course of Lowell's career, and be assured it is 
no small pleasure, we must leave to the reader. 

It should be said, in conclusion, that the 
attractiveness of Dr. Hale's book is enhanced 
by more than two score of portraits, facsimiles, 
and other illustrations, that in the course of 
his narration not a few of Lowell's poems are 
printed which either have not appeared before 
in print or are not now easily accessible. The 
most important of these poems, and a really 
beautiful poem it is, is one of sixty lines called 
" My Brook," which was written at Whitby in 
1889 and published the next year in the " New 
York Ledger." Owing to the circumstances of 
its publication, it does not appear in the " Li- 
brary edition " of Lowell's works.

FOLK-LORE TAL.ES or AMERICAN 
INDIANS.* 



Jeremiah Curtin needs no introduction to the 
folk-lore student or to the lover of good litera- 
ture. In his folk-lore work he is an original 
investigator, gathering his stories at first hand. 
His collections of Irish and Slav folk-tales are 
unsurpassed. The book before us, " Creation 
Myths of Primitive America," while not his 
first work upon American Indian legends, is 
the first he has presented in form for popular 
reading. The stories are gathered from two 
Californian tribes the Wintu and the Yana. 
These tribes have little importance numerically, 
and present a rather low grade of culture. 
Their stories are, however, rather unusually 
consistent and well-told. 

Mr. Curtin recognizes two cycles of myths 
among American tribes. " The first cycle of 
myths that is, those which relate to creation, 
in other words to the metamorphoses of the 
first people or gods into everything which is in 
the world, including the world itself is suc- 
ceeded by another in which are described the 
various changes, phenomena, and processes 
observed throughout nature. In this second 
cycle . . . light and darkness, heat and cold, 
opposing winds, heavenly bodies, appear as 
heroes and leading actors." These two groups 
Mr. Curtin calls creation myths and action 
myths. If these two are to be recognized 
and they should be, although they are often 
confused and intermingled a third group 
should be as clearly recognized. Barbarous or 
savage myths may profitably be distinguished 
as three in kind cosmogonic or creation 
myths, hero or action myths, and migration 
legends. 

Mr. Curtin considers only cosmogonic myths 
in this little book. Nine of those he presents 
are from the Wintu, thirteen from the Yana. 
They present considerable similarity, and illus- 
trate one system of thought. In an introduc- 
tory chapter the author, rather laboredly, dis- 
cusses " the Indian myth system." He quotes 
a native American as saying : 

"There was a world before this one in which we 
are living at present; that was the world of the first 
people, who were different from us altogether. Those 
people were very numerous, so numerous that if a count 
could be made of all the stars in the sky, all the feathers 
on birds, all the hairs and fur on animals, all the hairs 
of our own heads, they would not be so numerous as the 
first people." 

Mr. Curtin claims that the creation story 

* CREATION MYTHS OF PRIMITIVE AMERICA. By Jeremiah 
Curtin. Boston : Little, Brown, & Co. 



always begins with these conditions, and traces 
the actions of these " first people " and their 
final destruction or transformation giving rise 
to the world, animals, plants, and man. 

Certainly these Wintu and Yana stories illus- 
trate such a system. But is it not a little un- 
fortunate at this time to emphasize, as Mr. 
Curtin thus does, the unity of the American 
tribes ? All tribes do not give just such stories. 
We should cease, for a little, asserting the great 
likeness of all American Indians that " when 
you have seen one Indian you have seen all." 
Do not the works of Boas on American phys- 
ical types and the Northwest Coast myths, and 
the monographic studies of the Bureau of Eth- 
nology, show our present need to be the exam- 
ination of tribes in detail and the bringing out 
of differences rather than of similarities ? Just 
now, to lay out great systems for the whole 
" race " is confusing rather than helpful. 

Of course the stories are well-told : trust 
Mr. Curtin for that. The great number of 
actors and the strange names make it difficult 
sometimes to follow the narration, but on the 
whole the legends exhibit quaint ingenuity and 
shrewdness. Sometimes they show bold and 
lofty conceptions. The book is rather elegantly 
made up, but the binding is bad : the pages are 
likely to fall out with a single reading.

THE NEW EAST AND THE NEW SOUTH 
or THE OLD WORLD.* 

A new order of things is rapidly making its way 
in the Old World, and nowhere more rapidly than 
in the Far East. In Mr. Arthur Di<5sy's book 
on " The New Far East," we have an enthusiastic 
brief for Japan, proving by her late conquest of the 
Chinese her right and power as " a dominant fac- 
tor in Eastern Asia." Much to the disadvantage 
of the Chinese and Koreans, he compares them with 
the Japanese in their costumes, manners, and char- 
acters. In passing, he gives a curious origin to the 
immense broad-brimmed hat. 

" An ancient Korean king is alleged to have intro- 
duced them in order to put a stop to the continual riots 
and brawls that disturbed the country. In those early 
days the Korean was, as as he still is, a born plotter and

exceedingly fond of fighting not, indeed, of the strife 
with weapons on the battlefield, but of a good rough- 
and-tumble contest with fists and feet, cudgels and 
stone-throwing, such as the lower classes indulge in to 
this day, in the first month of the year, ward against 
ward in a city, and village against village in the coun- 
try. To him it is as much a ' divarsion ' as to any 
broth of a bhoy ' in the palmy days of Donnybrook 
Fair. This sportive pugnacity is not the only point of 
resemblance between the characteristics of Koreans and 
Milesians; both races combine charm of manner with 
a disinclination for sustained effort in serious matters; 
both are much attracted by politics of a militant sort. 
The condition of an earthenware hat, three feet in diam- 
eter, after a lively scrimmage between rival factions, 
may easily be imagined. Even that reproach to our 
civilization, the silk hat, would come better out of the 
fray. Now, a broken hat gives a disreputable appear- 
ance to its wearer in any civilized community; in ancient 
Korea it entailed more serious consequences than mere 
loss of outward respectability. Its possession rendered 
the purchase of a new hat unnecessary, as it involved, 
when brought under official notice, the instant decapi- 
tation of the owner. Nor was this the only advantage 
of the hat as a preserver of the public peace : it became 
simply impossible for the disaffected to put their heads 
together for the purpose of plotting treason when their 
skulls were surrounded by brittle brims a yard across." 

The author regards the Japanese as having no great 
vices and being free from many of the smaller ones. 
For example : 

" The Japanese cannot swear, even if he had a mind 
to; his language will not allow itself to be thus defiled; 
it contains absolutely no ' swear- words.' This limita- 
ation has its inconveniences; when a Japanese takes to 
playing golf he is obliged to learn English." 

The Japanese, Mr. Di<5sy maintains, are not merely 
imitative, they are constructing a new civilization 
as an expression of their own virtues and powers, 
the European civilization being merely an external 
stimulus. The enterprising cheap industry of Japan 
threatens the industrial supremacy of the West. 
The power of Russia and the inaptness of Britain 
in the Far East are emphasized. Russia regards 
it as her heaven-sent destiny to rule Asia and Eu- 
rope, to be the World-Power, and the Peace Con- 
ference is but " the truce of the Bear." Only if 
Britain ally herself with Japan and the United 
States, can Russia he kept in hounds. Such are the 
author's conclusions, and the book is certainly of 
interest and value as giving much real information 
on the vexed Eastern question from one who evi- 
dently has an intimate acquaintance with the peoples 
of the Orient. 

Another interesting hook on the New Japan is 
Mrs. Hugh Eraser's " Letters from Japan," a very 
pleasant account from the standpoint of a three 
years' residence in Tokyo and of some excursions 
in the country. The picturesque in landscape and 
people, and the poetic in legend and folklore, attract 
Mrs. Eraser, and she is of course greatly interested 
in the Japanese woman and child, both of whom 
she much admires. The intense patriotism of the 
Japanese, their unbounded simple-minded pride in 



their nation, was never more manifest than in the 
matter of the attack by a Japanese on the Cesare- 
vitch in 1891. 

" The theatres were closed, the shops and markets 
abandoned; everywhere people spoke in groups and 
with profound sadness in their tones. The little daugh- 
ter of Viscount A oka, the Minister for Foreign Affairs 
(she is ten years old), heard the announcement of the 
outrage with a stony face, and went away in silence to 
her room. There, for hours, she lay on the floor in an 
agony of grief and shame, moaning, ' I am a Japanese ! 
I must live with this shame ! I cannot I cannot!' . . . 
A little samurai girl, a mere child of sixteen, I think, 
was in service near Yokohama. She travelled to Kyoto, 
dressed herself in holiday robes, composed her little 
body for death by tying her sash tightly round her 
knees after the custom of samurai women, and cut her 
throat in the doorway of the great government offices. 
They found on her two letters: one, a farewell to her 
family; the other containing a message, which she 
begged those who found her to convey to the Emperor, 
saying that she gave her life gladly, hoping that though 
so lowly it might wipe out the insult, and she entreated 
him to be comforted by her death. Her name, they 
say was Yuko, which means full of valor. . . . People 
who were on board the Cesarevitch's ship told me that 
it seemed to sink with gifts ; the decks, the saloons, the 
passages were encumbered, and still they came and 
came and came ! The universality and spontaneousness 
of the manifestation gave it an overwhelming value, 
which the Prince here and his parents at home were 
quick to appreciate. Rich people gave out of their 
riches, and objects of unexampled beauty and rarity 
were brought out from the treasure-houses and sent 
with messages of love and respect to the boy who lay 
healing of his wounds in Kobe Harbour. The poor sent 
the most touching gifts the rice and shoyu, the fish 
and barley-flour, which would have fed the little family 
for a year; poor old peasants walked for days so as to 
bring a tiny offering of eggs." 

Mrs. Eraser has much to say of the social life of 
the highest circles of the Japanese officials ; she had 
exceptional opportunities of observation, and do- 
mestic life is portrayed with sympathetic insight. 
If ladies can be interested in books of travel, they 
will assuredly like this one. The illustrations are 
abundant and dainty. 

Africa, the New South of the Old World, ia 
changing most rapidly in the Far South. In the 
hook entitled " On the South African Frontier," 
Mr. W. H. Brown recounts his experiences and ob- 
servations " during seven years' participation in the 
settlement and development of Rhodesia." The 
hook " treats variedly of travel, collecting, hunting, 
prospecting, farming, scouting, fighting," and " had 
its origin principally in a desire to give to my 
fellow-countrymen in America a clearer idea than 
it has been possible to glean from fragmentary ac- 
counts, appearing from time to time, of the events 
which have taken place during the past nine years 
in connection with Anglo-Saxon conquest and colo- 
nization on the South African frontier." Mr. Brown 
had a hand in the opening up of Rhodesia, a country 
larger than France and Germany combined, with a 
climate like that of California ; a country fertile,

and rich in gold, iron, and coal. The natives made 
trouble on the African frontier much as the Indians 
did on our frontier, and several thrilling tales are 
given of conflicts between the whites and blacks in 
the Matabele and Mashona uprisings. Mr. Brown 
had a varied experience with them in war and peace. 
He notes an interesting trait of the Banyai. 

"High up among the rocks, in almost inaccessible 
places, these timid beings dwelt in neighborly proximity 
to the baboons and monkeys. Their fields were in the 
valleys below, where they raised Kafir corn, mealies, 
and melons. . . . The Banyai were apparently good- 
natured creatures, small of stature, though symmetri- 
cally and strongly built. The scouting party came upon 
a man working in his field, near whom were several big, 
shaggy baboons, industriously digging for roots. The 
savage was frightened at the appearance of the white 
men, but the baboons worked on, paying little heed to 
the intruders. . . . During the interview the baby 
baboons, up among the rocks near the dwelling of the 
natives, were heard crying, exactly like human babies. 
The Banyai were asked if the baboons did not molest 
the children, but they replied, ' No, they are friends 
with one another.' " 

"Under the African Sun," by W. J. Ansorge, 
concerns itself with the heart of Africa and the rise 
there of the Uganda Protectorate under British rule. 

" The Uganda Protectorate does not mean simply 
Uganda the kingdom which the famous autocrat King 
Mtesa ruled over once upon a time but it includes 
also the vast realms around it, territories where no 
white man has ever passed, lakes only recently dis- 
covered by hardy explorers and travellers, and races of 
men differing from each other in language, in manners, 
and in customs. Those who read stirring records of 
exploration and discoveries associated with names like 
Livingstone, Speke, Grant, and Mungo Park, are very 
much mistaken if they imagine that similar achieve- 
ments are out of their reach because all that can be dis- 
covered has been discovered. Within the last few years 
Count Teleki has added to the map two new lakes 
lying close together, and named by him Lake Rudolph 
and Lake Stephanie." 

Mr. Ansorge's work was not, however, that of ex- 
ploration ; but as medical officer and administrator 
he visited the various stations in Uganda, and re- 
cords in this book impressions of travel made since 
1894, describing the various districts and tribes, and 
giving some notes on hunting and collecting. Per- 
haps the most interesting of the tribes he visited 
were the Kavirondo. This people are not savages, 
nor even the lowest of barbarians, being farmers 
and iron-workers ; yet it is the fashion of all to go 
entirely nude. 

"Scanty dress may naturally be expected amongst 
savages of a low type and living in a tropical climate, 
but to find oneself among a race absolutely naked is a 
strange experience; and yet within a few weeks or 
months the novelty wears off, and one fails to notice 
anything extraordinary in such a mode of life. The 
inhabitants of Kavirondo recall the state of mankind in 
the Garden of Eden before the Fall. Banana-trees and 
other tropical vegetation around the huts, at least in 
some parts of their country, would strengthen this 
impression of being in a garden, were it not for the tree- 



less grass-plains outside the village. Young and old go 
about in the same primeval garb. Women often wear 
a curious ornament, in the shape of a tail, which con- 
sists of a number of plaited strings manufactured out of 
some sort of vegetable fibre. A tiny apron of the same 
material is worn by a few of the women. As it is never 
worn by the unmarried, I was told that its presence was 
the equivalent for the European wedding-ring; but I 
am sure this is incorrect, as I have come across numbers 
of young mothers and wives without this apron, and 
have seen widows with and without it. I believe it is 
simply a fashion, like the tail, without another object." 

The latter portion of the book is taken up with 
hunting adventures with elephants, lions, rhinocer- 
oses, hippopotami, gazelles, antelopes, and smaller 
game. This simple, clear, modest narrative makes 
attractive and agreeable reading, and the abundant 
illustrations are very good. 

While the advance of British influence is more 
rapid in South and Central Africa than in West 
Africa, yet here also, as Miss Kingsley indicates in 
her " West Africa Studies," England is fast increas- 
ing her power. But Miss Kingsley devotes some 
chapters to a sharp indictment of the English Colo- 
nial system, ending thus : 

" You have got a grand rich region there, populated 
by an uncommon fine sort of human being. You have 
been trying your present set of ideas on it for over 400 
years; they have failed in a heart-breaking drizzling sort 
of way to perform any single solitary one of the things 
you say you want done there. West Africa to-day is 
just a quarry of paving-stones for Hell, and those stones 
were cemented in place with men's blood mixed with 
wasted gold." 

Miss Kingsley probably knows more at first-hand 
about African fetish than any other living person, 
and there is much that is suggestive in her treat- 
ment of the subject. She finds in fetish a thoroughly 
natural and logical point of view which culminates 
in the highest philosophy. She can even learn wis- 
dom from a witch doctor. 

" He talked for an hour, softly, wordily, and gently ; 
and the gist of what that man talked was Goethe's Pro- 
metheus. I recognized it after half an hour, and when 
he had done, said, " You got that stuff from a white man.' 
' No, sir,' he said, that no be white man fash, that be 
country fash; white man no fit to savee our fash.' 
Aren't they, my friend?' I said; and we parted for 
the night, I the wiser for it, he the richer." 
Fetish often infects white people in Africa, and we 
suspect Miss Kingsley is too much of a fetishist to 
give the thorough objective analysis which science 
requires, though many of her remarks are very 
penetrating. Superstition everywhere is logical 
and rational in its own childish and foolish way. 
Miss Kingsley has many vivid sketches of the native 
African and we must close this notice with one ad- 
mirable bit on African volubility. 

" Woe to the man in Africa who cannot stand perpet- 
ual uproar. Few things surprised me more than the rarity 
of silence and the intensity of it when you did get it. 
There is only that time which comes between 10:30 A. M. 
and 4:30 P. M., in which you can look for anything like 
the usual quiet of an English village. We will give

man the first place in the orchestra; he deserves it. I 
fancy the main body of the lower classes of Africa think 
externally instead of internally. You will hear them 
when they are engaged together on some job each 
man issuing the fullest directions and prophecies con- 
cerning it, in shouts ; no one taking the least notice of 
his neighbors. If the head man really wants them to do 
something definite, he fetches those within his reach an 
introductory whack; and even when you are sitting alone 
in the forest you will hear a man or woman coming down 
the narrow bush-path chattering away with such energy 
and expression that you can hardly believe your eyes 
when you learn from him that he has no companion."

Petrarch as There are some men in the history 

scholar and of European culture whose manifold 

man oj letters. activities ref use to be brought within 
any single category. As writers, they occupy a 
place in the history of literature ; but all that may 
legitimately be said of them by the literary histor- 
ian is quite inadequate to explain why they loom so 
large in the broader history of the human spirit. 
Francis Bacon, Ludwig Holberg, and Leonardo da 
Vinci were such men ; such, preeminently, were 
Erasmus and Voltaire. And it is no mere " aberra- 
tion of national pride " that impels the greatest of 
Italian poets and critics now living to group the 
name of Petrarch with those of Erasmus and Vol- 
taire, as being, in their respective ages, the intel- 
lectual arbiters of Europe. This statement, indeed, 
is such a commonplace to the student of European 
humanism that we marvel at its seeming to need a 
defence, even for the popular mind, at the hands of 
the men who have prepared the very interesting 
book about Petrarch now before us. This book, 
which has for a title " Petrarch : The First Modern 
Scholar and Man of Letters " (Putnam), is the joint 
work of Professors James Harvey Robinson and 
Henry Winchester Rolfe. It consists mainly of 
selections from Petrarch's letters ; but the editors 
have added much matter of their own in the way 
of criticism, biography, and connective tissue. The 
result is such a presentation of the subject to English 
readers as had not previously been made, and we 
are heartily glad to have it. And it is an important 
thing to set Petrarch right in the popular estimate. 
" It is a sad commonplace to the thoughtful student 
of the past that the successful reformer is sometimes 
remembered for his weaknesses rather than for his 
true strength. Nothing is easier than to pronounce 
Voltaire a shallow deist, Erasmus a timorous dys- 
peptic crying peace when there was no peace, and to 
see in Petrarch only the lifelong victim of an unfor- 
tunate love affair." When we remember that " to 
their author, the incomparable sonnets seemed little 
more than a youthful diversion," we begin to get 
some notion of the true perspective of his life. He 
himself wrote of them thus disparagingly : " These 



popular songs, the result of my youthful distress, 
now overwhelm me with shame and regret, although, 
as we see, they are still acceptable enough to those 
suffering from the same malady." Again, we should 
recall the fact that, if it is important for us to know 
Petrarch for what he was in the history of culture, 
we are abundantly provided with the necessary ma- 
terials. Say our editors : " There is perhaps no other 
historical character before the age of Luther, with the 
possible exception of Cicero, who has left so complete 
and satisfactory account of his spiritual life and en- 
vironment." Thus we see that both the need and the 
matter for such a book as the one before us made its 
preparation desirable ; and in recognizing the one 
and dealing so intelligently with the other, Messrs. 
Robinson and Rolfe have laid us under a consider- 
able obligation. Among the interesting features of 
Petrarch's correspondence here given are some of 
the " Letters to Dead Authors," the letters to and 
about Rienzo, the famous description of the ascent 
of Mount Ventoux, and a series of letters and ex- 
tracts from letters in illustration of his classical 
studies. 

Letters of Two tastefully printed volumes of the 

18th century letters of Swif t, Addison, and Steele, 

essays. and of j o h n80 n and Chesterfield, 

edited by Mr. R. Brimley Johnson (Holt), intro- 
duce a series of a literary form most interesting to 
literary connoisseurs. The letter presented in serial 
groups, " each sufficiently large to create an atmos- 
phere," and together illustrative of the style and 
manners of the age chosen, is a new and welcome 
departure that promises to succeed, for the field is 
rich. In this century of Queen Anne and the first 
Georges, letter-writing was an art ; and then flour- 
ished also political parties and party literature. 
Although the tone of literature was lowered by the 
combative spirit, the fierce contention brought forth 
the greatest of English satirists and the most orig- 
inal writer of his age ; it unfolded the genius of 
the retiring scholar who gave to English literature 
a perfectly graceful style ; and its varying issues 
carried, now high, now low, the gay, imprudent, but 
generous, witty, and lovable adventurer, Dick Steele, 
whose name is always linked with those of Swift 
and Addison. In this turmoil, political and literary, 
we see on terms of intimacy the affairs great and 
small of each character. But familiarity does not 
breed contempt. Delightful are Steele's misspelled 
letters, " the most spontaneous unfeigned love-letters 
in the language." Addison appears here, as always, 
the Greek ideal, a just harmony of the virtues, noth- 
ing in excess, everything in measure, a model in 
propriety. Of the 239 pages of Volume I., 178, 
or three-quarters, are given to Swift ; and, indeed, 
the purpose of the book is to correct the common 
mistaken judgment of him derived from the essays 
of Macaulay, Thackeray, and Taine. This is the 
book's chief claim to a place on our already crowded 
shelves. The editor has placed the reading public 
under obligation for a real contribution to its knowl-

edge ; he has put into convenient form interesting 
letters available until now " only in more or less 
elaborate and expensive complete editions, or in 
small anthologies containing at most half a dozen 
letters by the same writer." The introductions do 
not attempt to cover the whole history of the time, 
and the notes are not chronological tables. Very 
properly, the letters are left to tell their own story, 
and thus the volumes seem well calculated for lovers 
of literature who enjoy the selection of letters, and 
can connote the historical, biographical, and literary 
setting. 

Memoir* of an The name of Henl 7 Reeve is not a 

English gentleman familiar one to the American public, 
and scholar. an( j one mav question whether it was 

much more widely known at home. This is sug- 
gested by the words that Mr. Lecky dedicated to 
his memory in the " Edinburgh Review," over 
whose destinies Mr. Reeve had presided for forty 
years. ' The career of Mr. Henry Reeve is per- 
haps the most striking illustration in our time of 
how little in English life influence is measured by 
notoriety. To the outer world, his name was but 
little known. He is remembered as the translator 
of Tocqueville, as the editor of the ' Greville Mem- 
oirs,' as the author of a not quite forgotten book on 
Royal and Republican France, showing much knowl- 
edge of French literature and politics ; as the holder 
during fifty years of the respectable, but not very 
prominent, post of Registrar of the Privy Council. 
To those who have a more intimate knowledge of 
the political and literary life in England, it is well 
known that during nearly the whole of his long life 
he was a powerful and living force in English litera- 
ture ; that few men of his time have filled a larger 
place in some of the most select circles of English 
social life; and that he exercised during many 
years a political influence such as rarely falls to 
the lot of any Englishman outside of Parliament, 
or indeed outside the Cabinet." But it is not for 
the interest that we may find in this career, singu- 
larly long and full as it was, nor for the pleasure 
and profit of knowing a fine specimen of English 
gentleman, that the two stately volumes of Reeve's 
" Memoirs " (Longmans) have their sole nor indeed 
their main value. It is rather for the familiar con- 
tact into which they bring us with many of the great 
political events and many of the most prominent 
men of Europe during the century just closing. 
One must not look to these volumes for " revela- 
tions "; but the near glimpses and the direct im- 
pressions of famous men, both of England and the 
Continent, and the selections from their letters to 
him, refresh and enlarge our knowledge of them. 
It was not a colorless medium in which they are 
here reflected. He brought to the observation of 
the men he met very positive opinions of his own 
prejudices, if you will ; but this contributes to 
heighten the vividness if not the truthfulness of his 
pictures as, for instance, in his account of his first 
meeting with Victor Hugo and Balzac. 



Mr. M. A. De Wolfe Howe's volume 

Some American "American Bookmen " (Dodd, 

men of letters. i ri \ i ml 

Mead & Co. ) does not call for the 
particular comment which would properly be given 
it were its contents not already widely known. The 
series of articles of which it consists was originally 
published in " The Bookman." This fact probably 
accounts for what seems to us an unfortunate title : 
in the ordinary use of the word (if there be an or- 
dinary use of a word so uncommon) a number of 
the men of letters here spoken of were not bookmen. 
We hesitate to think of Walt Whitman as a book- 
man, as Mr. Howe himself remarks ; and we should 
add Emerson or Hawthorne. But a title is often a 
minor matter : the title in its simplest significance 
has in this case little connection with the treatment. 
In some other ways the name does give an idea of 
the book, which is not a history of American liter- 
ature, nor a series of criticisms of American men 
of letters, although it contains a good deal that is 
historical and is written under the guidance of crit- 
ical estimate. It is a series of biographical sketches 
of the chief figures in our literature, well written 
and well illustrated. A book like this is of a good 
deal of value just now. Not that we have not 
enough books about American literature. There 
have been published in the last few years half a 
dozen school histories. Nor that this book is (or 
pretends to be) an adequate treatment of the de- 
velopment of letters in America. We can afford 
to wait for such a book until the end of the first 
century of American letters, which we incline to 
place in the year 1909, the centennial of " Knick- 
erbocker's New York." But while we wait, public 
interest is aroused and public opinion is stirred by 
such books as this. Mr. Howe had here a good 
opportunity, to which he proved himself quite equal. 
He includes the chief of our men of letters ; he 
writes a fluent account with rich illustration by por- 
trait, picture, and facsimile ; he has always some- 
thing of the critical idea in mind, and yet never 
really departs from his own plan to present his facts 
" primarily as a narrative." We are not sure that 
there is any other book which takes just the place 
for which this is planned : we certainly do not think 
of any that is better.

Auctions in England in the Seventeenth Century,"

period has not heretofore been treated in any de- 
tailed form, information relating to them, except 
what may with difficulty be gleaned from the orig- 
inal catalogues, being meagre and scattered. Mr. 
Lawler's little book, therefore, fills a want. Though 
book auctions had been common in Holland at least 
since 1604, the custom of disposing of libraries sub 
Jiasta did not begin in England till 1676, at which 
date a sale was held by William Cooper, a dealer

dwelling at the sign of the " Pelican " in Little 
Britain. The example of Cooper, who probably 
took his cue from the Elzevirs, soon found imitators, 
the method at once commending itself to collectors 
and persons wishing to dispose of their libraries. 
So from 1676 to 1700 over a hundred auctions were 
held, which meant the disposal of some 350,000 
works, bringing about 250,000 or a much 
greater sum if reckoned in the money value of to-day. 
The auctions soon spread to the provinces, and were 
held even in booths at country fairs. Dunton 
boasted of shipping " ten tuns " of books to Ireland 
to be sold under the hammer. Those were days of 
good bargains, too, of what would now be bar- 
gains undreamed of by the most sanguine collector, 
in books that now form the summum bonum of his 
pursuit. Fancy getting Holland's " HerOologia," with 
the fine portraits by Pass, for seven shillings ; Edward 
VI. 's " Prayer Book " of 1552 for sixteen shillings ; 
the Jenny Geddes " Prayer Book " of 1637 for four 
shillings ; or a first edition Bacon's " Advancement 
of Learning " for one shilling ! One's mouth waters 
at many such an item in these old lists. Mr. Law- 
ler's book comprises a general Introduction, followed 
by separate chapters on William Cooper's sales, 
Edward Millington's sales, those of other auction- 
eers of the century, the sale of Dr. Barnard's library, 
and John Dunton's Irish book auctions. There is

Afamou* j n a pre tty volume entitled " Story 

Frenchwoman , , r _ , J , TT . . . f 

at the court or the Jrrmcess des ursms in Spam 

of Spain. (R. jj. Russell), we have an account 

of one of those women of two centuries ago, who 
occupied high social station and made it the means 
of wielding real political influence. In 1701, the 
Princess des Ursins, then fifty-nine years of age, 
was appointed Camarera-Mayar at the court of the 
newly-established Bourbon dynasty in Spain. Her 
previous history and her experience in diplomatic 
affairs seemed to Louis XIV. to fit her for this post, 
and it was expected by him that her influence would 
serve to keep the vacillating Philip V. of Spain 
faithful to French interests in the war of the Span- 
ish Succession, then just breaking over Europe. 
The author of the present work, Miss Constance 
Hill, shows us that in this expectation Louis XIV. 
was disappointed, for from the moment of her ar- 
rival in Spain the Princess threw herself heart and 
soul into the cause of the Spanish Bourbons a 
course highly satisfactory to the King of France at 
first, but later distasteful to him when he would 
have sacrificed the interests of his grandson to the 
necessities of French policy. To her, indeed, more 
than to any other one person was due the stubborn 
courage which animated the loyal party in Spain, 
at a time when all seemed lost. Her discriminat- 
ing judgment of men, her careful estimate of the 
relative importance of events, her good sense in the 
every-day affairs of life, her skill in diplomacy, and 
above all her unfailing good nature and cheerful 
courage, are made plain by the pleasantly written 



narrative of her labors and by excellent selections 
from her letters to Madame de Maintenon and 
other personages of note in France. Even in her 
fall from power, after the contest with Austria was 
over and the battle won, we sympathize with her 
and admire her bravery, for in a measure she for- 
feited her position because she dared to attempt a 
reformation of that bHe noir of so many Spanish 
politicians, the Holy Inquisition. Possibly her part 
in the direction of Spanish policy is overestimated 
in the present volume, but certainly she was an 
influential woman, and her story is here prettily told.

u. s. Navy. Navy, which is shown on one side by 

the great increase in number and im- 
provement in character of the men anxious for 
naval service since the war with Spain, is reflected 
on another side by such a book as " From Reefer 
to Rear- Admiral " (Stokes), prepared a few years 
before his death by the late Rear- Admiral Benja- 
min F. Sands, U.S. N. The word "Reefer "in 
the title is misleading to a landsman, as indicating 
a rise from the ranks ; whereas Sands was a duly 
appointed midshipman from the beginning of his 
long and successful career. It is such a life as his 
which shows how unbroken is the tradition of our 
forces afloat. Sands, who was in active service for 
forty-seven years, from 1828 to 1874, including both 
the Mexican and Civil Wars, was the contemporary 
of Dewey, Sampson, and Schley, as he was of Far- 
ragut and Porter, the former having been a lieu- 
tenant on the first ship in which Sands saw service, 
and as the three great admirals of the war with 
Spain were of the two great admirals in the war 
between the States. David D. Porter was at the 
gallant taking of Tabasco from the Mexicans, as 
well as the gallant taking of Fort Fisher from the 
South ; and Farragut served with Porter's father, 
David Porter, Jr., in the famous cruise of the 
" Essex " in the war of 1812 ; while David Porter, 
Jr., was in the fight of the " Constellation " and the 
" Insurgente " in the naval war with France, serv- 
ing under Captain Thomas Truxton, one of the naval 
heroes of the Revolutionary War, and later with 
Decatur, Macdonough, Barney, and the rest, off 
Tripoli. David Porter, Sr., was also a Revolution- 
ary hero. Sands was a gallant officer, but his more 
memorable exploits were in the direction of the sci- 
ences. Here he was something of an extremest, 
inventing a deep-sea sounding apparatus, and being 
an astronomer at the bead of the Naval Observa- 
tory. The book is excellent reading, even if it 
makes no great addition to our knowledge of history.

effect a precipitate, may turn to Mr. W. M. Dixon's 
" In the Republic of Letters " (imported by Scrib- 
ner). These essays have been already published 
in magazines ; their author is Professor of English 
Literature in Mason College, Birmingham. So 
much will give a hint of what help Mr. Dixon will 
give the seeker. We have read the essays with 
interest. There are many critical essays published 
nowadays : in each we try to distinguish some new 
note. Here we distinguish none ; but to make up, 
we hear at times the clear, beautiful music which 
is now more like a reminiscence of some golden 
days of youthful appreciation than an allurement 
toward anything to come. There is no harm in that : 
we are prone to be too eager for " new notes " and 
" modern ideas "; there is such a thing as a charm, 
a beauty which is always old as old, say, as New- 
man, or Pascal, or Plato, and which is still mod- 
ern in spite of the Des Goncourts and Mr. Ruskin. 
We would hardly say that Mr. Dixon's work has 
the charm of those great persuasive writers whom 
we have just thought of. It does, however, have 
something more like it than we have found in much 
critical writing that has of late come to our notice, 
which is in some ways not saying very much, 
but in others is more than a little. 



The latest of In " The Physician " ( Macmillan ), 
the plays of the latest of the plays of Mr. Henry 
H. A. Jones. Arthur Jones to come to us in book 
form, we find the same originality of imagination 
and the same conventional staginess of treatment 
that have excited and depressed us before. It is 
something fresh and real to take for protagonist a 
famous specialist in nervous diseases who feels that 
his own life is poisoned by some strange trouble that 
his greatest skill cannot cure. There, it seems to 
us, the dramatist has a chance for some pretty deep- 
sea sounding in the human heart. But it also seems 
to us that it is not making the most of so good a 
chance to set your specialist down for six months' 
attendance on a temperance worker who is a victim 
to alcoholism to the extent of about one spree a 
month, all unsuspected by his charming fiancee 
whose tender solicitude it is that calls in the doctor. 
When one has got as far as that, it is not hard to 
foresee that the drunkard will escape the specialist 
and die in the gutter, and that the doctor's cruel 
nervous disease will be cured by the love of the 
ex-fiancee. Mr. Jones has been very successful 
in pleasing the many who gather in the theatres to 
see and hear ; it will be interesting to see how 
far he will please those who stay at home and read 
books. 

In the early part of the present cen- 
tury, that eccentric naturalist Con- 
statine Samuel Rafinesque published 
in " The Western Review and Miscellaneous Maga- 
zine " of Lexington, Ky., a series of articles on the 
fishes of the Ohio River. These were subsequently 
issued in book form, under the title " Ichthyologia

Ohiensis." This work contains the original descrip- 
tions of a considerable number of the fresh-water 
fishes of the Mississippi river system ; for the author 
had the evil fortune at least so far as his suc- 
cesses are concerned to stumble upon and to name 
many of the most common species of this great river 
and its tributaries. Indeed, he often wove a scien- 
tific description from an idle fisherman's tale, with- 
out ever seeing the mythical fish. Execrable as 
much of Rafinesque's work was, his " Ichthyologia 
Ohiensis " has become the foundation of fresh-water 
ichthyology in America. For many years his de- 
scriptions were often ignored, but the stricter appli- 
cation of rules of nomenclature in these later years 
has made his work the starting-point for all who 
would deal comprehensively with the subject. Dr. 
R. E. Call has done the science a service by his 
carefully edited reprint (Burrows Brothers) of this 
ichthyological classic. The book contains a portrait, 
several facsimiles, a complete bibliography of Ra- 
finesque's ichthyological publications, and a brief 
sketch of this versatile but unfortunate naturalist. 
The volume is handsomely gotten up, and will be a 
welcome addition to the library of every student of 
our fresh-water fishes.

at a reduced price, of " Without Dogma," the powerful 
psychological novel of modern Poland. The translation 
is by Miss Iza Young. 

" Sir Bevis," being an " adaptation " of the " Wood 
Magic " of Richard Jefferies, made into a reading-book 
for young people by Miss Eliza Josephine Kelley, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Giun & Co. 

" Books I Have Read," published by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead, & Co., is one of Lamb's biblia a-biblia. It is a 
blank book intended for readers of other books who may 
wish to note down their impressions. 

"Sound "is the first volume of "A Text-Book of 
Physics," to appear in five sections. It is the work of 
Professors J. H. Poynting and J. J. Thompson, and is 
published in America by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

Mr. Samuel Harden Church's " Oliver Cromwell," 
duly reviewed by us when published five years ago, is 
now put forth by the Messrs. Putnam in a sumptuous 
" Commemoration " edition, with eighteen full-page 
illustrations. The edition is limited to six hundred 
copies. 

Baedeker's " United States " (imported by Scribner) 
has reached a " second revised edition," in which we 
notice no material changes. It is a model of condensa- 



tion and reasonably up-to-date information, and we 
counsel travelling Americans, no less than visiting 
Europeans, to add it to their luggage, no matter how 
slender the latter may be. Mr. J. F. Muirhead, who 
has become a resident of this country, continues to be 
the editor of this highly useful publication. 

Two new volumes, the fourth and fifth, in the " His- 
tory of Egypt," of composite authorship, have j ust been 
imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Professor 
Mahaffy writes the volume upon the period of the 
" Ptolemaic Dynasty," while the period of " Roman 
Rule " has fallen to the pen of Mr. J. Graftou Milne.

JOHN LANE'S NEW BOOKS 



SOME MODERN CLASSICS 

THE COLLECTED POEMS OF WILLIAM WATSON. With Portrait. $2.50. 

" I prefer the poet who sings of my immortal soul to the chap who sings of windlasses and steam- winches. And BO I prefer William 
Watson to Kipling." Mr. VANCE THOMPSON in The Criterion, 

THE LAST BALLAD, and Other Poems. By JOHN DAVIDSON. Fcap 8vo, $1.50. 

The London Times says : " Mr. John Davidson, when the fine frenzy of inspiration is upon him, writes verse that must appeal to all who 
have any poetical instinct. His imagination glows and his phrases strike home. He stands among the few writers of the day who really write 
poetry, and ' The Last Ballad, and Other Poems ' is a volume in which his finer qualities are evident." 

THE SEQUEL TO "AYLWIN." 

THE COMING OF LOVE: Rhona BoswelPs Story and Other Poems. By THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON, 

author of ' Aylwin.' Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

Literature says : "In 'The Coming of Love ' (which, though published earlier, is a sequel to ' Aylwin ') he has given us an unforgettable, 
we cannot but believe an enduring, portrait one of the few immortal women of the imagination. Rhona Boswell comes again into ' Aylwin. ' " 

A NEW BOOK BY THE AUTHOR OF "FOREST LOVERS. 1 ' 
PAN AND THE YOUNG SHEPHERD. By MAURICE HEWLETT. Crown 8vo, $1.25. 

"Even more distinctively and richly imaginative than his 'Forest Lovers.' It is a bit of bold fantasy, veined with passion, lightened by 
the humors of rusticity." The Outlook. 

THE WIND AMONG THE REEDS. (New Poems ) By W. B. YEATS. $1.25. 

The London Outlook says : " In truth Mr. Yeats' work, for which we have waited several years, is a beautiful gift." 
MORE. By MAX BEERBOHM. A Volume of Essays. $1.25. 

" In his hands the knack of graceful impertinence is raised by dint of sheer mastery to the dignity of a serious art ; there are moments, 
indeed, when he brings it within measurable distance of the sublime." Literature. 

THE SPIRIT OF PLACE, and Other Essays. By ALICE MEYNELL Fcap 8vo, $1.25. 

The London Pall Mall Gazette says : " A rare book. One cannot believe that a writer whose perceptions are so fine but so human, whose 
reflections are so fine but so just, can write anything one would not wish to read." 



NEW NOVELS 



By Author of " Patience Sparhau'k," " The Californium." 
A DAUGHTER OF THE VINE. By GBBTRUDE ATHERTON. Sec- 
ond Edition. $1.50.

The authors believe that in the earlier years of English work the 
critical side of teaching should be subordinated to the constructive, stimulative side, and that 
the pupil should be encouraged to write freely, and to form habits of thought and of invention, 
before his expression is minutely criticized.

BOYS AND GIRLS AND BOOKS. 

The curse (we use the word deliberately) 
which at present rests upon the teaching of 
English literature in our elementary and sec- 
ondary schools is the imposition upon young 
people of a priori programmes. We try to 
inculcate a love of literature by making boys 
and girls read books that they do not like, sim- 
ply because in our Olympian opinion, and from 
our superior point of view, they ought to like 
them. The result is the natural one that a 
large proportion of our grammar and high- 
school children learn to hate the very name of 
literature, and by our injudicious treatment are 
cut off (many of them for good) from one of 
the chief joys of life. And yet nearly all of 
them have their literary interests, have some- 
where in their mental make-up the germs of 
good taste. Any intelligent teacher, free to 
deal with the problem presented by a particu- 
lar individual or even a particular class of stu- 
dents, can get at these interests and develope 
these germs. But this necessary freedom in 
diagnosis and treatment is denied to most teach- 
ers by the stupidity of the authorities placed 
over them, and they are condemned to the hope- 
less task of working within the rigid limits of 
prescribed texts and courses. The colleges, for 
example, announce that they will examine can- 
didates in certain texts, and the consequence 
of this announcement is that thousands of hap- 
less young students (to take two peculiarly 
flagrant cases of recent years) are set to study- 
ing Defoe's " History of the Plague " and 
Burke's speech on " Conciliation." Small won- 
der if, under these circumstances, the study of 
literature itself becomes a plague, because ab- 
solutely devoid of the sort of conciliation that 
is really needed. And if undue deference is 
not paid to the requirements of the colleges, 
there is never any lack of doctrinaires among 
superintendents and committeemen to devise 
programmes that are equally well calculated to 
destroy the nascent liking for literature that is 
the normal possession of healthy young minds. 

This way of dealing with the most sacred 
interests of children is educational quackery 
and nothing else, whether it proceed from auto- 
cratic individuals or from bodies of educators 
in solemn conclave. It is the proprietary-

medicine principle applied to the treatment of 
the mind. The fatuousness of prescribing cer- 
tain texts to be studied by children in certain 
stages of their education is so amazing that 
words are inadequate to deal with it. That 
one man's meat is another man's poison is a 
statement as true in psychology as it is in phys- 
iology. Imagine a body of representative phys- 
icians meeting for the purpose of preparing a 
course of drugs to be administered uniformly 
to young people of certain ages. At fifteen, 
let us say, they should take calomel for so many 
months, quinine for so many others, and thus 
throughout the whole period of development. 
The illustration is grotesque, no doubt, yet it 
offers a fair parallel to the methods of many 
educators when dealing with this delicate ques- 
tion of literary instruction. Mr. Ruskin once 
described himself as " a violent Tory," and the 
contemplation of such methods as these should 
be enough to make " a violent Individualist " 
of everyone having a proper appreciation of 
the aims to be kept in view by the teacher of 
literature. " Chaos is come again " would 
doubtless be the cry of the partisans of routine 
should their precious schemes be roughly set 
aside in the interests of the individual student. 
But in pedagogy, at least, there is one thing 
worse than chaos, and that thing is the sort of 
regimentation toward which so much of our 
modern education tends. 

We are impelled to these observations by 
the recent publication of a small book called 
" An Introduction to the Study of Literature," 
compiled by Dr. Edwin Herbert Lewis. It is 
a book of detached pieces, about one hundred 
and fifty in all, and, as we look it over, our 
first impression is that it offers one more incen- 
tive to that " reading by sample " against 
which Mr. Pancoast protests so effectively in 
the last number of " The Educational Review." 
A further examination, disclosing such juxta- 
positions as William Cullen Bryant and Mrs. 
Charlotte Perkins Stetson, Walt Whitman and 
Mr. William Canton, Shakespeare on " the 
fop " and Cardinal Newman on " the gentle- 
man," gives the impression that we are plung- 
ing into a sort of literary grab-bag, and curi- 
osity as to what will come out next becomes the 
predominant element in the consciousness. But 
our thoughts take a more serious turn when 
we seek in the preface of the book to discover 
the principle upon which it has been put 
together. It then appears in its true light as 
an attempt (the first of its sort that has come 
to our knowledge) to place before young peo- 



ple the kind of literature that they really like 
instead of the kind that their elders think they 
ought to like. The book is based upon actual 
experiment rather than upon a priori reasoning ; 
each selection is the result of an induction from 
many observations rather than of a deduction 
from any pedantic principle. But in this mat- 
ter Dr. Lewis must speak for himself. 

First of all, he tells us that the appeal of 
literature should be made to the " highest nor- 
mal interests " of the student. Then, " it must 
be ascertained by what stages the imagination, 
the emotions, and the character develope. The- 
oretically, there is a masterpiece for every 
month of the student's life. The surest way of 
learning where the masterpieces fit is to allow 
the student to ' browse ' in a library." The 
following passage describes the method which 
has resulted in the volume now under consid- 
eration. 

" Various classes in the Lewis Institute have been en- 
couraged to ' browse,' to see if they might not hit upon 
a body of literature that would remain a constant inter- 
est to their equals in age. However imperfect and 
incomplete these investigations, the sifting process, upon 
which the students entered actively and honestly, has 
been of the greatest value to all concerned. It has 
shown that noticeable differences of interest exist be- 
tween ninth and tenth, tenth and eleventh grades. In 
the nature-sense, for instance, as it appears in the youth 
not hopelessly hardened by ' business ' aims, there are 
usually marked changes between thirteen and sixteen. 
The change is first from the child's scientific curiosity 
about nature to a half-poetic, but objective, interest in 
her; the boy becomes capable of direct, unreflecting joy 
in nature, or even of direct displeasure with her, in 
something of the Homeric manner; then he slowly grows 
to sympathize with the modern view, so much more 
imaginative and sometimes so much less wholesome than 
Homer's." 

That the method thus outlined is the only 
rational one for the teaching of literature to 
young students seems to us beyond question. It 
makes the work attractive rather than forbid- 
ding. It coaxes the recalcitrant tastes and 
emotions instead of domineering over them. It 
prepares the way for that systematic study of 
literary history and aesthetics that has its un- 
disputed place in the later stages of education, 
but is entirely out of place in the earlier years. 
We should not be taken to mean that Dr. Lewis 
has prepared a book that may properly be 
administered to any class of young people of 
the age with which he has dealt. That would 
be denying the fundamental principle of our 
philosophy. But he undoubtedly has prepared 
the best sort of book for his own particular set 
of young people, and a book, furthermore, 
which points to other teachers the way in which

they should get at the interests of their own 
students. Nor must it be imagined that hia 
method runs to " chatter," or that it neglects 
the disciplinary aspect of instruction. He says 
at the outset that " there is need of Spartan 
severity regarding chirography, orthography, 
punctuation, syntax, and logic. The task of 
securing correctness by Spartan methods, and, 
at the same time, of arousing an unconstrained 
love for noble literature, is the almost hopeless 
labor set for the English teacher. Gradgrind 
and enemy of Gradgrind he must be within the 
same hour. But there is no escaping the double 
duty, and no denying that the second part of it is 
the more important." Note the emphasis of this 
latter clause, and note also the word " uncon- 
strained," which must be the keynote of suc- 
cessful endeavor. It is because constraint is 
applied at the wrong points that our schools 
make so miserable a failure of that part of their 
work which should exemplify the most shining 
success. And this misapplied constraint, be it 
observed, rarely comes from the initiative of 
the intelligent teacher ; it rather originates in 
the councils of those set above him in author- 
ity, and is transmitted by him, unwillingly 
enough, to the hapless victims of the system 
with which both teachers and students are 
burdened. 



SPIRIT OF SONG. 



O where, O where, 

Into the blue engirdling vasts of air, 

As fair and evanescent as the dawn, 

blithe and winged spirit, art thou gone, 
And why so far withdrawn ? 

Of yore, of yore, 

When sea and shore 

Were glad with summer or with winter frore, 

1 knew thy radiant presence eve and morn; 
Now am I lone and lorn! 

From day to day 

I wait thy coming in the old sweet way, 
Thy zephyr-soft surprisings grave or gay; 
Thy tremulous minors and thy majors bold; 
Thy melodies manifold! 

Return, return, 

O thou for whom I yearn! 

Gladden my heart, as doth the stir of spring 

The earth, with vernal hopes on fairy wing, 

All clearly cadencing! 

So. shall I know 

Once more the ecstacy, the thrill, the glow, 
That lifts above the whelm and surge of strife 
Wherewith the rondure of our days is rife, 
So shall I touch the haloed heights of life!

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



MR. KIPLING'S "CYNICAL JINGOISM" TOWARD 

THE BROWN MAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read with rather special interest the pages of 
your issue of May 16, in which Mr. Henry Austin (im- 
pelled by " the hardihood of intense conviction, coupled 
with a stern sense of duty ") reproves a public given 
over to a " hysteria of unreasoned admiration," to a 
" toy tempest of flatulent adulation," of Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling. 

It is quite unnecessary for any admirer of Mr. Kip- 
ling's work to attempt any reply to assertions that the 
" Recessional " is inferior in technique and style to the 
work of "a dozen other English poets," particularly 
Mr. Rennell Rodd ; or that " most of his verses " are 
" on the same plane with the work of many minor En- 
glish and American poets." With all due respect to 
Mr. Austin, such statements, even when they appear in 
THE DIAL, violate all laws of physics by having no ac- 
tion except a reaction. 

But when a journal like yours gives place to a char- 
acterization such as the following, I feel as if the most 
obscure reader had a right to protest. Mr. Austin, after 
quoting Dr.. Felix Adler's denunciation of Mr. Kipling's 
" teaching as a gospel of force," goes on: 

"It is not, however, with Kipling's jingoism and frank 
cynicism toward inferior races, as the Apostle of Force, of 
Might against Right, that literature is concerned, except inas- 
much as these essentially pagan and very antiquated senti- 
ments might be shown to affect his art." 

Now, it is the penalty of candor to subject itself to 
misunderstanding as well as wilful misrepresentation; 
yet it is difficult to conceive how a man of Mr. Austin's 
intelligence can make a declaration of so peculiarly 
inaccurate and unjust a nature as the above, except on 
the supposition that he has not read a large majority 
of Mr. Kipling's writings. Here is an author who 
writes of things as they are not as they might be; of 
men who do the world s work, dirty work, hard work, 
unpoetic work much of it, not of those who delude 
themselves and others into believing that matters are 
as they would like to have them. He is perhaps more 
entirely sincere, more thoroughly free from hypocritic 
cant or shadow of self-deception than any writer now 
prominently before the public: it is very natural that 
such frank disregard of their little air-structures should 
offend the sentimentalists; but it is almost incredible 
that any fair-minded person could speak of his " cyni- 
cism toward inferior races " after even the most super- 
ficial examination of his stories and poems that deal 
with the natives of India and the Far East. Is this 
quality to be found in " The Masque of Plenty " (" De- 
partmental Ditties ") written, too, when his work 
showed a far greater preponderance of head over heart 
than was later visible ? Or perhaps in " The Song of 
the Women " ? or " What the People Said " ? Does 
Mr. Austin's " intense conviction " result from a con- 
templation of "The Ballad of East and West" or 
" Guuga Din," or, in prose, of " The Story of Muham- 
mad Din," " Without Benefit of Clergy," " The Judg- 
ment of Dungara," "At Howli Thana," "Gemini," 
"The Sending of Dana Da," "On the City Wall," or 
any other of dozens of poems and stories which are to 
be found in Mr. Kipling's books ? 

What a miserably unfair thing is it, because an author 



390 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



tells more intimately and openly than ever before of 
" Tommy Atkins " whose chief business is policing 
and fighting black and brown men to cry out upon 
him as the " Apostle of Might against Right " ! Ignor- 
ing all the innumerable ways in which he has shown an 
understanding of the native, and a real manly, brotherly 
feeling for him, such as our literature does not equal 
elsewhere ! 

The truth is that Mr. Kipling has been the first 
man who has ever introduced the Anglo-Saxon to the 
real native of India a fellow-man, with hopes and 
fears, and pride and resentment, and hopeless resigna- 
tion. His best claim to attention is his infinite sympa- 
thy with all things animate and inanimate: this is the 
very warp and woof of his whole literary fabric. He 
has well earned the right to inscribe in his books as he 
has done in the beginning of his new " From Sea to 
Sea": "Write me as one that loved his fellow-men."

FREE DISCUSSION OF THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In reading your timely and pertinent editorial on 
" The Menace to Free Discussion," in your issue of 
May 16, one smiles at the thought that Mr. Atkinson's 
little pamphlet should demoralize our soldiers at Manila. 
These soldiers can tell far more those who have re- 
turned have told me far more than Mr. Atkinson ever 
dreamed of, of the horrors of war and disease. 

No doubt THE DIAL is right in believing that the 
impulse to emulate British colonial methods is " noth- 
ing more than a severe fever that will run its course 
and pass away." The heart of the patient is sound, and 
the reaction will come sooner or later. But one neces- 
sity of convalescence is that the patient be very careful 
to guard his ways. The sequelae of this illness promise 
to be appalling. Most of us have admitted, in loose 
fashion, that we were likely in a new enterprise to make 
blunders; but few anticipated such colossal and fatal 
mistakes as we have been led into, without our consent, 
within the last few months. 

No one dreamed, for example, (1) that we should 
break our pledge not to seek extension of territory by 
force of arms; or (2) that we should repudiate without 
explanation our promises to our allies in Luzon, what- 
ever these pledges were. We have (3) failed to con- 
ciliate these people, once our allies, or even to appear 
to try to conciliate them. We have (4) refused for 
mouths to give them any answer to their questions as to 
our plans. We have (5) rejected or insulted their en- 
voys. If the determination of policy rests with Con- 
gress, we have failed to tell them so, or (6) to arrange 
for a peaceful modus vivendi until Congress should meet. 
We failed (7) to take advantage of the hopeful begin- 
ning of civil government at Malolos. We have (8) 
played fast and loose with ourselves, talking in one 
breath of duties to civilization, in another of impe- 
rial conquest; in one breath of free constitutional rule 
in the islands, in another of industrial slavery and the 
demands of commerce. We have (9) adopted no pol- 
icy of our own, in the hope, apparently, that chance 
called " manifest destiny " may give us what justice 
must refuse. We began war (10) on February 5, the 
general in charge using as an excuse a drunken escapade 
of natives for which their leaders were not responsible. 
We (11) refused their explanations, and their request 
for a neutral zone and a truce. We (12) have held 



our army in such relations that friction with the natives 
was inevitable. We have (13) rejected all later offers 
of peace except on the outrageous terms of " uncon- 
ditional surrender." We have (14) treated these peo- 
ple on their own soil as " rebels," in defiance of fact, 
of justice, and apparently in defiance of our own Con- 
stitution and of the recognized law of nations. We 
have (15) permitted a declaration of war to be virtu- 
ally made by a general who at the best is regardless of 
statesmanship, and who is reported rarely to leave his 
office " where he devotes himself faithfully to the duties 
of a quartermaster's clerk." The operations of this 
most undemocratic war have been in part conducted 
(16) with the same waste and cruelty that roused us all 
to indignation in Cuba. The towns we occupy have been 
burned and looted ; and the natives, rich and poor, ed- 
ucated and barbarous alike, have been alike shot or 
driven to the swamps. I suppose that successful war- 
fare in tropical islands can be waged in no other way. 
Guerrilla warfare means devastation. Why not end the 
horror at once ? We have nothing to gain by victory, 
nor our opponents anything to lose save their lives by 
defeat. Meanwhile, the most gigantic blunder (17) 
known to man or nation is to refuse to retrace false 
steps. 

As matters are, we can only wait till the curtain falls. 
If in trying to do what seems wrong we have blundered 
so awkwardly, what would be the result of an attempt 
on the part of the powers that be to do what is right ? 
In hands unskilful or unclean any policy is doomed to 
failure. The American people can only watch the play 
till it is played out, and maybe heed its lessons for the 
future. Meanwhile, the problem of what to do with 
Cuba and the Philippines is tenfold more difficult than 
it was a year ago. DAVID STARR JORDAN.

SCORN NOT THE ASS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Have not " Pbilister's " critics, in THE DIAL of 
June 1, been a little harsh with that unfortunately 
constituted gentleman ? His case seems to me one call- 
ing for compassion rather than anger. Would Professor 
Rice and S. E. B. trounce a blind man for speaking ill 
of Raphael, or a deaf one for flouting Beethoven ? My 
own attitude toward " Philister " I have endeavored to 
convey in the subjoined stanzas. I trust he will see 
that, though the figure employed therein is homely, the 
sentiment is sincere. 

LINES TO A TETHERED ASS. 

(With apolfigiet to Sterne.) 
Pensive I view thee, thou poor drudge of Fate, 

In thy small circumscript abjectly tied, 

While the rude elements tempestuous beat 

Their pitiless tattoo on thy rough hide. 

For thee the rose is scentless, and for thee 
The fluting throat of Philomel is still; 

Thy fairest dream is of a thistle-field 

Where thou canst browse at ease and munch 
tl.y fill. 

I am not of thy scorners; for I see 

How bare thy lot is, and how dim thy day : 

My ear compassionate can e'en detect 
A plaintive note in thy discordant bray.

ATJBKEY BEARDSL.EY IN PERSPECTIVE.* 

It was while watching the progress of a 
friendship between two exceedingly unattract- 
ive boys an attraction between two repellants 
that I arrived at a sense of the possible 
charm of unlovely things. The connection of 
Beauty and the Beast is pathetic in some 
minds for Beauty, in others for the Beast ; but 
in the companionship of Beast and Beast, in- 
stead of a double pathos one finds a double 
beauty. This is a surprise that the hideous 
often contains for those who are apt to consider 
the non-existence of a quality proved by their 
inability to perceive it. Adroitly evaded as 
companions by their brighter eyed and more 
ready tongued kind, these two youths had dis- 
covered in each other of necessity piercing 
below externals that charm inherent in all 
humanity, the perception of which is love. The 
occasional wonder, to which we are all subject, 
as to whatever he saw in her or she in him, 
and why they married, is after all only a proof 
of our inferior and their superior sympathy or 
perception in that especial case, of course. 
So, in view of the first repulsive impression of 
the bulk of Aubrey Beardsley's work, and the 
strongly expressed sympathy of such trained 
perceptions as Mr. Joseph Pennell and Mr. 
Arthur Symons, it becomes somewhat of a duty 
to endeavor to understand what they saw in 
him, rather than to insist on what most of us 
do n't see. 

Of the three books dealing with Beardsley 
recently published, the smallest is a reprint of 
Mr. Arthur Symons's essay which originally 
appeared in " The Fortnightly Review." The 
next in size is a collection of fifty drawings, 
published without comment ; and the last and 
largest is the sumptuous volume published by 
Mr. John Lane with a preface by Mr. H. C. 
Marillier. Mr. Marillier avails himself of Mr. 
Symons's essay to a degree which would seem 
to make that essay the authoritative statement, 
backed up as its spirit is, in my mind, by Mr. 
Pennell's generous-spirited letter to the " Lon- 
don Daily Chronicle " soon after Beardsley's 
death. To anyone who is trying to range

ley. New York : John Lane. 

AUBREY BEARDSLEY. By Arthur Symons. Unicorn 
Quarto, No. 3. New York : M. F. Mansfield and A. Wessels. 



Beardsley's work in its relation to the absolute, 
Mr. Symons's critique is somewhat of a disap- 
pointment, as it deals mainly with Beardsley's 
work in its relation to Beardsley. Acknowl- 
edging the impossibility of entirely eliminating 
the personal equation, the real interest of the 
present moment would, however, seem to be 
rather the value of Beardsley's work in relation 
to ourselves and to our existence. Letting this 
unknown quantity be represented for the mo- 
ment by a:, we have, in considering these draw- 
ings, to remember three things : that they are 
the work of a young man who died at the age 
of twenty-six, that they are largely of that char- 
acter we have agreed to describe as Pagan, 
and that, given a few more years of life, the 
young man would probably have gone alto- 
gether to the good. Mr. Symons indicates the 
beginning of this last process in referring to 
Beardsley's last drawings, in which, he says, 

"Beardsley has accepted the convention of nature 
itself, turning it to his own uses, extracting from it his 
own symbols, but no longer rejecting it for a convention 
entirely of his own making. And thus in his last work 
we find new possibilities for an art which, after many 
hesitations, has resolved finally upon the great compro- 
mise, that compromise which the greatest have made 
between the mind's outline and the outline of visible 
things." 

That is very good, both for Beardsley and for 
Mr. Symons, who has put an important prin- 
ciple very featly and instilled a very definite 
regret that Beardsley died before these possi- 
ble futurities were consummated. The state- 
ment enables us to transfer to x the third fac- 
tor, that of Beardsley's probable volte-face, so 
that x = value of Beardsley's work to us and our 
existence = our regret at early death before it 
had any. This leaves the two factors of Beards- 
ley's youth and his paganism ; and looking over 
the drawings, one realizes that he was indeed 
young bitterly young. An assumption of 
knowledge of good and evil especially evil 
seems inseparably connected with the inexpe- 
rience of youth ; but this phase, evident as it is 
in Beardsley, is slight compared with another 
the impressionable quality with which he 
receives and records in rapid succession the 
many and varied influences of masters past and 
present. 

Mr. Symons, in discussing Beardsley's work, 
assists us to an understanding of it with epi- 
grams like this : " At one time of his life, a 
man works in order to please a woman ; then he 
works because he has not pleased the woman ; 
then because he is tired of pleasing her," 
which is good as an epigram, but hardly uni-

versal. We also find phrases such as "the 
spectacular vices," " sin transfigured by beauty 
and then disclosed by beauty," and he later 
tells us that " a profound spiritual corruption 
is a form of divine possession by which the 
inactive and material soul is set in fiery motion, 
lured from the ground into at least a certain 
high liberty. And so we find evil justified of 
itself, and an art consecrated to the revelation 
of evil equally justified." These illuminating 
sentences are powdered with descriptions of 
" bloated harlequins," " bald and plumed Pier- 
rots," " leering dwarfs," " immense bodies 
swollen with the lees of pleasure," "cloaked 
and masked desires smiling ambiguously at 
interminable toilets." Anyone reading this 
essay before seeing the drawings would be justi- 
fied in inferring that the dead artist did not 
draw very nice things ; but somehow the gen- 
eral impression is that the essay and the draw- 
ings are concerned with something too artificial 
to be really evil. One might even argue from 
Mr. Symons's pleasure in his own descriptions 
that he himself is somewhat youthful ; for " lees 
of pleasure " and " masked desires smiling 
ambiguously " are excellent terms, but terms 
derived rather from a good literary instinct 
than from any cryptic experience of the kind 
so darkly hinted at. And then, looking at the 
drawings and seeing the very evident and 
marked reflection of Burne-Jones, Botticelli, 
Velasquez, various Japanese artists, Diirer, 
Flaxman, and others, one is convinced that the 
character, plastic enough to receive so rapidly 
so many impressions, is youthful enough to be 
its own excuse for many errors of judgment. 
So it happens that when Mr. Symons says 
Beardsley expresses evil with an intensity which 
lifts it into a region almost of asceticism, there 
arises a mild impression that he is talking about 
a knowledge and an experience of evil which 
Beardsley could not and naturally did not ex- 
press. The general impression given by most 
of the subjects of the drawings is truly one of 
much vulgarity ; but to imply that the strange 
creatures therein represented are evil, or even 
unconventional, would be distressingly anthro- 
pomorphic. Mr. Wells, in his very exciting 
story " The War of the Worlds," has invented 
a race of Martians who cannot possibly be 
judged by our code of sexual morality, because 
they are bi-sexual, and reproduce by a budding- 
off process. Du Maurier did the same thing ; 
so have others ; and it would be uncritical, be- 
cause the nice people I know usually take wraps 
to the theatre, to condemn the race invented 



by Beardsley who conspicuously don't. They 
are evidently the product of different condi- 
tions, and different systems of ventilation, 
and cannot be judged by the standards by 
which we judge. As Mr. Wells's people, from 
our point of view, are neither moral, immoral, 
nor supra-moral, but are rather non-moral, so 
Beardsley 's people at the theatre or other- 
wheres can only be described in the same way. 
They are a strange race to whom may well be 
applied the artist's comment on himself : " Par 
les dieux jumeaux tous les monstres ne sout 
pas en Afrique "; their ethical standard is un- 
known, and, frankly, they inspire one with no 
desire for further love or knowledge of them. 
Mr. Symons and Mr. Marillier apparently 
think them profoundly evil. I may miss the 
point ; but then I have my consolations, and 
both gentlemen must know that we have seen 
the swollen bodies and lees of pleasure before, 
in Japanese work, rendered with a much greater 
skill than Beardsley's ; and of them we have 
always said that, judged by occidental stand- 
ards, they were rather low. 

The terrible annunciation of evil, which is 
insisted on so strongly, will, I think, when 
investigated, simmer down to an unpleasant 
vulgarity. Most terrible annunciations and 
denunciations do, and the dwarfs and monkeys 
and swollen bodies, and so forth, cannot mean- 
while obtain admission to the Palace of Art, 
on Mr. Symons's pretense that they are sym- 
bols. A symbol is something substituted by 
general consent for something else, and we are 
by no means agreed on these. The justification 
of this vulgarity in the minds of most, includ- 
ing Mr. Symons, is that " perfection of line is 
virtue." 

" That line which rounds the deformity of the cloven- 
footed sin, the line itself, is at once the revelation and 
the condemnation of vice, for it is part of that artistic 
logic which is morality. And, after all, the secret of 
Beardsley is there, in the line itself rather than in any- 
thing intellectually realized which the line is intended 
to express." 

Supposing the end it is wished to realize is a 
very ill-defined one, such as a terrible annun- 
ciation of evil is likely to be, it is of course 
pleasant to find that the medium per se is 
charming. Still, to be insulted wittily, to be 
drugged sweetly, to be smothered with roses, 
are states achieved by means which may be 
consolations but are by no means compensations. 
That struggle with his material which is the 
despair of every artist may well account for 
Mr. PennelPs admiration of one who seemed 
to dominate his so easily, but it is hardly a

factor that can be transferred to x. Drawings 
of the sort that Beardsley did with such power 
over line and mass and decoration, always seem 
to me to be accurately described by reference 
to one of Poe's stories, " The Facts in the Case 
of M. Valdemar." M. Valdemar is mesmer- 
ized in articulo mortis. This arrested the nat- 
ural post-mortem process, and retained the 
body in statu quo ante mortem for some months 
until the experiment of awakening him was 
made. As soon as the mesmeric influence was 
withdrawn, M. Valdemar became what seven 
months' death makes of us all. It is not a 
pleasant story, and those interested in details 
are referred to the original ; but, taking Beards- 
ley's power over mass and line as the parallel 
to the mesmeric force of the story, it seems as 
though in the majority of his drawings it were 
used in the same way to arrest the natural 
decomposition of a mass of matter which can 
only be maintained in a horrid semblance of 
life, has no virtue in it, and were better entirely 
dead. It is not a pleasant use of power (ref- 
erence is again made to Poe's story for details), 
but, however used, it is power ; and it is un- 
doubtedly in this very ability to delineate, to 
compose, to balance mass and void, to sustain 
a harmonious relation of line to line, of whole 
to unit, in this sensitiveness to organic rela- 
tionship, we begin to get a hint of that charm, 
that fineness, which Beauty discovered in the 
Beast, and Mr. Pennell in Beardsley's draw- 
ings. By any trained or sympathetic percep- 
tion, this inherent charm is doubtless at once 
divined ; but it must not be forgotten how large 
a part loneliness must have played in quickening 
the perceptions of Beauty ; the loneliness of a 
worker struggling with his material in the vast- 
ness of any art is a parallel situation, but one 
impossible to the multitude of us. 

With all due credit, then, to Beauty and to 
Mr. Pennell for their generous perception, it is 
yet somewhat of a relief to consider how much 
emotional effort was economized, and how many 
apologies Beauty was saved by the translation 
of the Beast into a handsome Prince that 
transformation which Mr. Symons mentions as 
occurring in Beardsley's last drawings, the 
possibility of which is evident in all. Beauty 
was probably as glad to be relieved from the 
strain of reminding herself that though hid- 
eous her husband had a beautiful disposition, 
as Mr. Symons must be at not having to 
sustain his paradox of an abstract spiritual 
corruption revealed in beautiful form. In the 
same way, most of us prefer the line of least 



resistance; and we shall undoubtedly evade 
those drawings in which the subject is nasty 
but the drawing skilful, in favor of those in 
which the Prince's sense of life is conveyed in 
a fine smile rather than a sneer. This qual- 
ity we find in such drawings as the " Chopin 
Nocturne " and " Ballade," the two Venus de- 
signs, " Les Revenants de la Musique," the 
outline portrait of Re jane, and most of the 
cover and catalogue designs. Herein we have 
the Prince (the fairy-tale Prince perhaps, 
somewhat light and glancing) ; Mr. Pen- 
nell is justified, and x ceases to be a merely 
minus quantity. For herein is the subject that 
attracts and induces us to linger until the 
innate quality penetrates also. Here we have 
no poor dead M. Valdemar maintained in an 
unconvincing semblance of life by a misuse of 
power, but life itself in a most delicate and 
evanescent aspect caught and depicted in a way 
that makes it a force in quickening the feeling 
for the delicate and fanciful in others. There 
never yet was anything but regret at the death 
of anyone who gave promise of ministering with 
power to the needs of the human character ; 
and in that promise, and some slight beginnings 
of fulfilment, lies the value of Beardsley to us : 
not the thing he did for the most part, nor the 
thing he started others doing, but the work he 
gave promise of doing. That promise, scat- 
tered through his executed work, excites a 
regret, a deep and tender regret, he nearly 
missed, but which is nearer to fame than the 
notoriety he desired and achieved. 

With regard to the books as books, it must 
be added that the Unicorn quarto came to 
pieces at the first possible opportunity, and Mr. 
Marillier's prefatory note in the large edition 
is, for a prefatory note bearing the address of 
Kelmscott House, vilely printed, ranging from 
a smudgy black to a very pale gray. The " Sec- 
ond Book of Fifty Drawings " is of course 
mainly interesting to those who have the " First 
Book," since it is a sort of addendum containing 
many drawings whose only interest is that they 
were done by A. V. B.

OUR NEW ISLAND POSSESSIONS.* 

Our national events of the past year have 
opened a new door to old writers and developed 
a host of new ones. Book-stalls are already 
groaning under the burden of books descriptive 
either of the events of the year or of the lands 
touched by these events. The new and fresh 
works on these islands are a welcome addition 
to our geographical and ethnographical litera- 
ture. Doubtless many who considered them- 
selves well-read in matters of general interest 
could have told little about them a year ago. 

The Philippine Islands especially were to the 
most of us an unknown land. One of the freshest 
and best of the accounts of this great archi- 
pelago, now the point of chief interest in our 
military affairs, is that written by Mr. Ramon 
Lala, a native Manilan, educated in England 
and in Switzerland, and now a naturalized 
American citizen. He is thoroughly conver- 
sant with his native land, its peoples, its former 
and present oppressors, its struggles for liberty, 
its customs, its resources and commercial im- 
portance. He writes as a man who has gathered 
his information at first-hand, and is enthusiastic 
in the telling of it. He sketches fluently the 
early history of the islands, the British, Dutch, 
and Chinese struggles on its shores, and the 
final Spanish colonial system of (mis)govern- 
ment. The poor Filipinos have been beaten, 
lashed, robbed, and almost crushed out of ex- 
istence by long centuries of corrupt and vicious 
methods of control. But we cannot properly 
speak of the Filipinos as a nation : they are no 
nation. They consist of about eighty different 
tribes distributed among the hundreds of islands 
of the archipelago. They vary in the scale of 
civilization all the way from the educated Ma- 
nilan or Tagalog to the wild men of central 
Mindoro or Mindanao, who recognize no supe- 
rior authority, and know as little about the 
refinements of civilization. The whole group 
of islands registers in area not far from 150,000 
square miles, or about as much as the combined

areas of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
Maryland, and Delaware. Luzon and Min- 
danao are about equal to all of the other islands 
combined, and either one of them is nearly the 
size of Cuba. All of the islands are mountain- 
ous, and of volcanic formation. The principal 
peaks in Mindoro, Mindanao, and Luzon, rise 
more than eight thousand feet above the sea. 
The flora of the islands is beautiful beyond 
description. 

" One that has never seen it can form no idea of the 
splendor of such a tropical forest teeming with all that 
is brilliant and grand in nature. It would seem as if the 
Creator had emptied the cornucopia of his gifts over this 
garden-spot of the world, making it a veritable Eden." 

This prodigious growth is forced by the hu- 
midity of the atmosphere, and by the enormous 
annual rainfall averaging ninety inches. 
This botanist's paradise is not surpassed any- 
where on the globe, either for the variety of its 
species or for the stupendous growths seen on 
every hand. Mr. Lala describes the principal 
agricultural industries of the islands, such as 
that of raising rice, hemp, tobacco, coffee, 
fruits, etc. The mineral wealth is supposed to 
be great, and its future a boon to the islanders. 
The volume closes with the American occupa- 
tion of Manila and the long wait for the con- 
clusions of the peace commission. Mr. Lala has 
done an excellent service for his native land, 
and, so far as we may judge from the scope of 
our reading, has done it in a fairly impartial 
manner, though leaving a more favorable 
impression of the Filipinos than found in other 
writers. The book is well written, very read- 
able and instructive, and profusely illustrated. 
For an all-around view of the Philippines, it is 
surpassed in modern works only by that of 
Mr. Foreman. 

Major Younghusband's work entitled " The 
Philippines and Round About " is a free-and- 
easy description of the Philippine Islands, 
Aguinaldo, Iloilo, Manila, Dewey's naval bat- 
tle, the fall of Manila, Admiral Dewey, the 
American soldier, the career of Rizal, the future 
of the Philippines, Saigon, Java, etc. The 
value of his work lies in the fact that it gives 
the impressions of a widely-travelled, wide- 
awake, and straightforward Englishman. The 
" inside " information furnished on the events 
of the last three years in the Philippines is 
enough to arouse the ire of the most phleg- 
matic temperament. The Spanish methods of 
buying off Aguinaldo, of robbing merchants to 
pay fees and fill their own pockets, of wresting 
exorbitant fines, of bloody, almost indiscrimi- 
nate, slaughter of suspects, furnish us examples 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

of the species of political and civil training that 
the Filipinos received at the hands of Spaniards. 
The author visited Aguinaldo at his own head- 
quarters and paints in vivid colors what he saw. 
" Aguinaldo is a young man of only twenty-nine years 
of age, stands about five feet four inches in height, is 
slightly built, and dressed in a coat and trousers of drab 
tussore silk. He is a pure Philippine native, though 
showing a slight trace of Chinese origin, of dark com- 
plexion and much pock-marked. His face is square and 
determined, the lower lip protruding markedly. On the 
whole a man of pleasant demeanor, even-tempered, and 
with strong characteristics. Slow of speech, and per- 
haps also of thought, his past career has hall-marked 
him as a man of prompt decision and prompter action. 
... A short time ago it appears that another of the 
insurgent leaders began to secure a following which bade 
fair to shake the supremacy of Aguinaldo. The Presi- 
dent stayed to take no half measures, attempted no 
parleying; he grasped the nettle firmly, and ordering 
his reputed rival out into the courtyard, had him shot 
on the spot. ... In conversation Aguinaldo professed 
his complete ignorance of the terms on which the En- 
glish exercise jurisdiction over the protected states of 
the Malay Peninsula, and of how a dependency like 
India is governed, and capped his ignorance of the out- 
side world by asking whether Australia was an island, 
and whether it belonged to America. . . . therefore it 
was no surprise to be asked whether the Americans or 
the English won the battle [of Omdurman]. In spite 
of the strict embargo placed on the importation of arms, 
Aguinaldo said that he was then expecting a large con- 
signment of Mauser rifles and ammunition from a Ger- 
man firm." 

The author attributes to Aguinaldo great credit 
for the manner in which he maintains his hold 
upon his people, and the determination which 
he exhibits to fight for complete independence. 
His criticisms of the American army are free 
and outspoken : 

" The army and navy of America and t'heir welfare 
are not in the hands of well-tried sages of the military 
and naval services, but are like many other vital mat- 
ters the shuttlecocks of political parties. . . . With- 
out for a moment wishing to criticize too severely a 
force thus thrown together, under officers without stand- 
ing, experience, or training, and remembering well what 
excellent troops men of the same nation were trans- 
formed into in the course of a prolonged campaign by 
leaders like Washington, Lee, or Grant, yet it would be 
only inviting the Americans to court future disaster if an 
outside critic were to refrain from expressing an opinion 
that such troops are not fit, under the rapid conditions 
of modern warfare, to meet an army highly organized 
and highly trained, and ready to take the initiative at a 
moment's notice. . . . We should be doing the Amer- 
icans an unkindness if we allowed it to be thought that 
such tardy mobilization [as that shown at the beginning 
of the campaign in the Philippines] would not put them 
under the severest disadvantages if their antagonists 
happened to be any one of the first-class Powers of the 
world." 

The author describes an arrangement with the 
Spaniards during the last days of the siege of 
Manila, 



" Whereby the town was to be saved from bombard- 
ment, and the Americans, after the brief show of resist- 
ance which would satisfy Spanish honour, were to be 
allowed to enter and occupy the place. . . . The Amer- 
ican fleet was for the space of an hour or so to shell the 
Polverina or Powder Magazine. ... At the end of the 
given period the fleet was to cease firing, and the Span- 
ish Governor would then hoist the white flag in token 
of capitulation, after which the American troops were 
to enter the town and occupy it." 

The subsequent clash between the Spanish and 
American troops, on the eve of surrender, was 
due to a failure to see the proper signal. Major 
Younghusband's tributes to the valor, good be- 
havior, and gentlemanly bearing of the Amer- 
ican soldier must be noted as in striking con- 
trast with that of the former occupants of the 
fortresses and camps about Manila. 

" Fully 75 per cent of the men are mature, power- 
fully built fellows, averaging probably 24 or 25 years 
of age, fine strapping fellows, who would do credit to 
the Grenadier Guards, and taken all round a more pow- 
erful and hardy set than are now to be found in a Brit- 
ish line regiment even after a prolonged foreign tour." 

Mr. Noa's little book entitled " The Pearl of 
the Antilles " is a brief, concise statement of 
some of the Spanish movements which aroused 
and justified the Cuban struggle for independ- 
ence. His access to sources and state papers 
not mentioned by other writers gives his book 
a kind of permanent value to students of Cuban 
history. 

"Our Island Empire," by Mr. Charles 
Morris, is a handbook of the four groups of 
islands mentioned in the title Cuba, Porto 
Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines. The author 
has compiled useful material regarding each of 
these on such points as (1) history, (2) phys- 
ical conditions, (3) natural productions, (4) 
civil and political relations, (5) centres of pop- 
ulation, (6) manners and customs, (7) agri- 
cultural productions, (8) manufactures and 
commerce. A very good small map and an 
index accompany the volume making it a 
kind of vade-mecum. Its information is not, 
as that of many new works on special islands, 
first-hand, but collated from many sources. 

" Everything about Our New Possessions " 
is a compilation, much of it in statistical form, 
of some things only, rather than everything, 
about our new possessions. It contains many 
valuable facts gleaned from many sources ; but 
lack of discrimination in the use of material, 
lack of harmony in matter taken from different 
sources, lack of any map or chart or table of 
contents, and a poor index, rather hastily de- 
cide the fate of this little book.

THE ECONOMICS AND PHILANTHROPY 
OF BUSKIN.* 

Although much has been written about Mr. 
Ruskin's economic heresies, and about his social 
theories in general, it is interesting to learn the 
opinion of one who is himself known as an 
economist, if not a very orthodox one; and 
especially when the opinion is so clearly and 
attractively expressed as Mr. Hobson's always 
are. That he is an appreciative critic appears 
from the preface, where it is said : 

" Mr. Raskin will rank as the greatest social teacher 
of his age, not merely because he has told the largest 
number of important truths upon the largest variety of 
vital matters, in language of penetrative force, but be- 
cause he lias made the most powerful and the most felic- 
itous attempt to grasp and to express, as a comprehensive 
whole, the needs of a human society and the processes 
of social reform." 

The further claim is made that Mr. Ruskin 
" has done more than any other Englishman to 
compel people to realize the nature of the social 
problem in its wider related issues affecting 
every department of work and life, and to en- 
force the supreme moral obligation of confront- 
ing it"; and again, he is called "the man who, 
by the conjunction of the keenest sense of jus- 
tice with the widest culture and the finest gifts 
of literary expression, has succeeded in telling 
our age more of the truths it most requires to 
know than any other man." 

But Mr. Hobson by no means permits his 
admiration to blind him to the economic defects 
of Mr. Ruskin's writings ; on the contrary, he 
criticizes particular propositions more in detail 
than one feels to be really necessary. Minute 
dissection is not the kind of examination which 
seems most appropriate to Mr. Ruskin's polit- 
ical economy; the exaggeration of eloquence 
leaves many points vulnerable, and yet the 
shafts of criticism aimed at these may leave 
the main body of the argument untouched. 
But at any rate, it speaks well for the real 
worth of Mr. Ruskin's philosophy that so severe 
a critic can be at the same time so enthusiastic 
a disciple. And it fulfils the saying of Mr. 
Ruskin himself, that no true disciple of his 
would ever be a Ruskinian: "he will follow, 
not me, but the instincts of his own soul, and 
the guidance of its Creator." 

However open to criticism Mr. Ruskin's po- 
litical economy may be in certain details, there 
are other points at which it will bear the closest 
scrutiny. In some of his word-contests with the 
orthodox economists of his time he but antici-

pated the more scientific economics of to-day. 
There is no more representative example of this 
than his insistence upon the fundamental im- 
portance of Consumption, as the human end 
for which the industrial processes of Produc- 
tion, Distribution, and Exchange all exist. To 
take a mere matter of nomenclature for another 
example (for Mr. Ruskin never thought the 
abuse of the Queen's English an unimportant 
matter), the economists now approximate his 
use of the word " cost " as meaning human dis- 
utility, and when they mean money cost or 
expense instead of real cost they now think it 
worth while to say so. Even in denying the 
name of Political Economy to the orthdox indus- 
trial science of his day, and calling it Mercan- 
tile Economy instead, Mr. Ruskin was right, 
and doubtless meant to enforce a lesson which 
might have been learned, or at least begun, 
with " The Wealth of Nations " for a primer. 
For a long time after Adam Smith's day eco- 
nomic theories were evolved with a notable 
disregard for the political or social point of 
view, and even Mill professed to consider only 
" some of their applications to social philoso- 



In Mr. Hobson's view, the most revolution- 
ary of Mr. Ruskin's positions is his use of the 
term " value " to mean intrinsic usefulness 
instead of value in exchange ; yet in that too 
he only amplified Adam Smith's conception of 
" value in use." While that is not just the 
sense in which the term is used by economists 
to-day, it is a use quite consistent with, and 
following naturally from, or else leading logic- 
cally to, his subjective conception of cost; and 
the economists have at least gone far enough in 
the same direction to see that value is largely 
a subjective phenomenon. Mr. Hobson attaches 
so much importance to the reduction of cost and 
utility to their true bases in human joy and 
pain, that he is led to say of Mr. Ruskin's 
work that it " will hereafter be recognized as 
the first serious attempt in England to establish 
a scientific basis of economic study from the 
social standpoint." We must at least admit, 
if we are reasonably unprejudiced, that while 
Mr. Ruskin may have been as far from the 
literal truth on some points as were the econo- 
mists whom he held up to ridicule and scorn, 
he has proved on the whole a true prophet; 
and true prophets are as rare and as valuable 
to society (in the Ruskinian sense) even as 
scientific economists. They are not as valuable 
in the commercial sense, of course, because no 
one cares to pay a prophet a salary for merely 



1899.] 



THE DIAL

being a true prophet ; they must " get out and 
hustle " with the rest of us. Even a prophet 
who is lucky enough to have prosperous and 
thrifty forbears is likely to spend his fortune 
and most of his earnings in good works, as Mr. 
Kuskin has done. 

It is in Mr. Ruskin's politics, rather than in 
his economics, that Mr. Hobson finds the most 
fundamental errors, and points out certain ap- 
parent inconsistencies, not of word or phrase 
merely, but of very substance, which are difficult 
to harmonize. Mr. Kuskin is at once a good 
deal of a socialist and an arch-individualist : the 
latter because of his aristocratic instincts, rein- 
forced by the philosophy of Carlyle, and the 
former owing perhaps to the negative influence 
of the mercantile economists. At times he 
recognizes that the democratic movement is 
inevitable, and not altogether to be regretted ; 
yet again he seems to stake the future upon the 
virtue of a ruling class to be composed of a 
regenerated nobility. If Mazzini, with whom 
he has much in common, had been his master 
in politics instead of Carlyle, his whole social 
philosophy would have been more consistent ; 
for it would have lost much of its individualism, 
and with it the dependence upon aristocracy, 
and gained more of collectivism and the demo- 
cratic spirit. To be sure, democracies need 
often to be reminded that they must have 
trained leaders that politics is a science and 
administration a profession ; but the reminder 
would have carried more weight with English- 
men and the sons of Englishmen if the de- 
mocracy of the message had been more 
apparent. 

Mr. Kuskin deserves to be called a social 
reformer quite as much because of his own 
actual attempts to improve matters as on ac- 
count of the ideas expressed in his books ; but 
Mr. Hobson gives no complete account of these 
experiments, though he devotes one chapter to 
a few of them, including especially the St. 
George's Guild and the revival of hand weav- 
ing and spinning. He also tells something 
about the principal institutions and associations 
which serve as monuments to Mr. Kuskin by 
carrying out his ideas, such as the Museum at 
Sheffield begun by the master himself, the 
Home Arts and Industries Association, the 
Kuskin Linen Industry of Keswick, the craft 
school in Westmoreland, and the Ruskin Soci- 
eties at Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, and 
elsewhere in both England and America. To 
many readers this will prove the most interest- 
ing part of the book; but they will wish there 



were more about the Working Men's College, 
the improved tenements, and even the " Hink- 
sey diggin's," and something at least about 
the tea-shop and the street- cleaning. Perhaps 
Mr. Hobson thought these matters sufficiently 
treated in Mr. Collingwood's " Life "; but there 
is other material in various out-of-the-way 
places,* and it would seem well worth someone's 
while to bring it all together. One growing class 
of Mr. Ruskin's admirers would like above all to 
know more about Mr. Ruskin's influence upon 
the University Settlement movement; they 
know that the idea was born at his house, at a 
meeting in which he had called together a hand- 
ful of university men who were already living in 
East London, but no one seems to know just 
how much of the plan was conceived by Edward 
Denison and John Richard Green, and how far 
it was Mr. Ruskin's own. There is a remark- 
able correspondence between the activities of 
the Settlements and Mr. Ruskin's conception 
of the functions of Bishops, which suggests that 
both ideas may be products of the same mind 
to a greater extent than has been supposed. 

In giving to the world this guide to the study 
of the Ruskinian social philosophy, Mr. Hob- 
son has performed a real service, for the phil- 
osophy in question is scattered through so many 
works, and sometimes expressed in such fanci- 
ful language, that most readers get but a hazy 
idea of what Mr. Ruskin's views really are. 
But, as Mr. Hobson says : 

" The confusion, even chaos, of which some careless 
readers of Mr. Ruskin complain, yields to a clear unity 
of system as we regard the meanderings of his versatile 
intelligence from the standpoint of social justice, a plea 
for honesty of transactions between man and man. This 
unity of system is not indeed a mechanical unity, an 
objective system of thought, but rather a unity imposed 
by personal temperament and valuation. When we 
understand it, we understand John Ruskin, his person- 
ality, his view of life." 

The tributes expressed and implied in this 
volume ought to gladden the heart of the grand 
old man at Brantwood, who believes his social 
and economic teachings to be the most import- 
ant part of all his varied work. It is indeed 
rare that so radical an iconoclast comes to be so 
all but universally hailed as a true prophet 
during his lifetime, or even has the satisfaction 
of reading so sympathetic and discriminating 
an exposition of his heresies.

STUDIES OF SOCIETY AND HUMANITY.* 

Professor Giddings has followed his " Principles 
of Sociology " with a " text-book for colleges and 
schools." In the effort to reduce his material to 
more elementary form for young students, there is 
a gain in clearness of style, and at many points the 
author has wisely learned from his critics. The 
claim is made, in the " note to the reviewer," that 
there are important developments of theory not 
fully presented in the earlier and larger work : the 
analysis of the practical activities of social popula- 
tions and of the motives from which they spring ; 
cooperation ; a fuller analysis of the social mind ; 
civilization, progress, and democracy ; and a new 
statement of psychological causes of social phe- 
nomena. 

In essential features, and modes of thought and 
treatment, we have the same book as " The Prin- 
ciples of Sociology "; but at many points this virile 
writer has written his way to greater clearness and 
fresh points of view. It is very desirable that so- 
ciology should be presented from many sides by 
minds of different orders ; and all students of the 
subject will be grateful for the many suggestive 
hints and interesting speculations of Professor Gid- 
dings. The teachers and the students who use this 
text-book for beginners ought to be put on their 
guard, however, against a certain danger in the writ- 
er's way of statement. This way may be illustrated 
by a part of the last chapter (p. 342), in which we 
are taught that our interpretations of our fellow-men 
are made by ascribing to them our own experiences. 
While there is an important truth in this statement, 
it needs more qualification in order to prevent im- 
posing on the outer world our own subjective modes 
of thought. There is a confidence in some of the 
generalizations set down which does not seem justi- 
fied by the present state of knowledge. At one 
place (p. 237) we read : " We are unable to ascer- 
tain very much about the earliest beginnings of hu- 
man society." But in the immediate connection we 
have generalizations which would require quite com- 
plete and connected knowledge to justify. In one 
sentence we have a double affirmation of certainty 
which almost awakens scepticism (p. 240) : " The 
process was undoubtedly the same in the early de-

velopment of spoken language in primitive human 
communities, except that the original process un- 
doubtedly occupied a much longer time." In another 
place we have the unqualified assertion (p. 232) : 
" There is hardly a single fact in the whole range 
of sociological knowledge that does not support the 
conclusion that the race was social before it was 
human, and that its social qualities were the chief 
means of developing its human nature." But the 
eminent naturalist Dr. L. F. Ward ("Outlines of 
Sociology," p. 90 ff.) seems to take precisely oppo- 
site grounds. The reader should at least take pains 
to compare the statements and see if the difference 
does not lie in different definitions of the word 
" social." 

While it does give one a comfortable sense of 
finality and completeness to have his sociology 
served up in such neat, comprehensive, and author- 
itative form, one can hardly avoid the feeling that 
much work remains to be done. The solution here 
offered appears to be too easy, in view of the mul- 
titude of unsettled problems in all the sciences on 
which sociology depends. If, therefore, this strong, 
clear, massive book is used with youngsters, already 
too quick to catch the dogmatic spirit and be done 
with philosophy at a gulp, we would advise a com- 
panion volume of more modest scope. The true 
pedagogue will know how to start with outward ex- 
pressions of social thinking, with local and verifi- 
able phenomena, and lead the pupil up to these 
heights of bold speculation. And the teacher who 
realizes the peril of prematurely closing discussion 
under the spell of a powerful book will be careful 
to start inquiry as to the grounds of assertion. In 
doing this, the teacher will but obey pedagogic sug- 
gestions made by the author himself, but not by any 
means uniformly followed. 

In the chapter on " The Theory of Society," the 
" law of least effort " is made to play a command- 
ing role. The claim must not pass without critical 
challenge. " The law of least effort " has a place, 
but it is too vague, general, and negative to give a 
true cause of, say, the English Constitution, the 
world of Shakespeare, the million social aspirations 
which seek expression in Tennyson and Browning. 
The attempt to explain the psychical life by modes 
of reasoning applicable to the physical sphere is 
unsatisfying. The formula which is adequate for a 
wind or a stream breaks down when it professes to 
meet the demands of the infinitely wide processes 
and contents of spiritual being. The " law of least 
effort " does have place in the physical side of being 
which is correlated to the psychical. But prema- 
ture identification of the two sides is not fruitful of 
discovery or explanation. One may agree with 
Professor Giddings (Preface, p. vi.) that the field of 
social phenomena should be outlined in high school 
and college, in order to coordinate politics, eco- 
nomics, ethics, and law, and yet see the necessity of 
having this text-book used by an instructor who 
knows enough of the history and schools of sociology 
to prevent his becoming a slave of any one of them.

A certain university training in sociology would be 
necessary for one who proposed to use this or any 
other text-hook in preparatory school or college. To 
these sentences of caution we may now add, in good 
conscience, that no one who professes to teach soci- 
ology has a moral right to neglect this volume. 

The United States Commissioner of Labor is in 
the most advantageous position for preparing the 
materials for such a hook as " Practical Sociology." 
The strength and limitations of this volume lie in 
the fact that the industrial and economic element is 
made the commanding feature of the discussion. 
This is entirely natural for one whose life has been 
devoted to collecting and interpreting materials of 
the economic order. In this field of thought, Mr. 
Wright's book presents more abundant stores of 
fact than any similar publication. The statistical 
matter is actually made interesting. Nor would it 
be fair to say that the author neglects those social 
values which are the really ultimate ends of wealth 
itself and of political organization. Indeed, the 
idealist is delighted to find everywhere a frank rec- 
ognition of the cultural aims of enlightened human- 
ity. But the limitation of the method of treatment 
may be seen in the meagre discussion of the aesthetic 
social interest, and the relatively large space given 
to industrial and commercial phenomena. Sociology 
still suffers from being in the frontier stage where 
the bare struggle for being monopolizes attention, 
and Aristotle's " well-being " loses its full meaning 
and is reduced to the economic order. This criti- 
cism does not signify that Mr. Wright has said too 
much on economics, when he talks as master and 
expert ; but only that the complete presentation of 
so vast a subject cannot be made by any one mind. 
The student of society is here supplied with a mass 
of data of great importance, and is directed to 
abundant and valuable sources of information and 
discussion. The treatment is rather elementary and 
popular in form, and the spirit almost too optimis- 
tic. One is grateful that we have such a man as 
Mr. Wright at the head of our Department of Labor. 

The papers relating to the work and studies of 
South End House, Boston, now collected into a vol- 
ume entitled "The City Wilderness," deserve a 
fuller notice than can here be given. They consti- 
tute one of the most weighty and significant con- 
tributions ever made in America to the interpreta- 
tion of crowded urban conditions and heterogeneous 
populations. The essays are not extemporized, but 
are the " hard-won gains of actual experience." 
Every phase of life is portrayed with a master-hand ; 
the history of the district, the elements of popula- 
tion, the conditions of health, the work and wages, 
the secret of political corruption, tendencies to vice 
and crime, amusements, religion, education, charity, 
philanthropy, city government, are all adequately 
described. Students of social amelioration will here 
learn the price of progress and the grounds of hope. 

It is far more satisfactory to read Mr. Wyckoff's 
story of " The Workers " in book form than in the 
fragments of magazine articles. The second vol- 



ume is even better than the first. The author has 
grown in power of observation. He has learned at 
every step. He gains in respect for the working- 
man as he understands his situation and motives. 
Old residents of Chicago will learn something of 
their own city from this volume, and if readers are 
not moved to act for betterment they are incapable 
of response to one of the finest appeals ever made to 
the higher nature of man. Every city official should 
ponder the treatment given the street wanderers, 
and be led to study the achievements of Boston, 
New York, and Indianapolis. In the next genera- 
tion these pictures of human beings, guiltless of 
crime, sleeping on stone floors in police stations, 
which reek with disease and swarm with vermin, 
will seem incredible. But there are the photo- 
graphs, and here is the testimony of a sensitive 
scholar, finely bred, who lay down among the vaga- 
bonds that he might help to know and redeem them. 
Mr. Wyckoff's account of country life in the West 
is charming and cheering. It is a soul's rest after 
the tragedy of the city and its congested labor mar- 
ket and sweating dens. 

If the public remains ignorant and apathetic in 
relation to the Unemployable, it will not be the fault 
of such writers as Professor Wyckoff and Mr. Jacob 
Riis. The latter's sketches of New York City life 
among the lowly are set forth by a master-hand, 
and tell the story with mighty pathos. One does 
not think of " literature," but of life, as he reads 
these stories. Here is one who has looked and thought 
and sympathized. He has watched the motley com- 
pany which throngs the miserable streets and police 
courts of the metropolis, until he knows all their 
types of character, all their tragedies and comedies. 
When our cities become habitable, and the poor are 
decently provided for, and the slums are cleansed, 
and humanity is restored, among the sons of the 
tribe of Abou Ben Adhem, Mr. Riis will be in the 
front row to receive plaudits. To bless his name 
will arise Denny the Robber, John Gavin the Misfit, 
the foundling Chinese baby, the brave fireman whose 
story he tells, the policemen whose vices he repro- 
bates while he glorifies their humanity and good- 
ness. It is not high life ; it is not beautiful, nor 
even clean ; but divine elements are discovered, and 
the promise of better things. " Love hopeth all 
things." 

The little volume of essays by Mrs. Bernard 
Bosanquet are fine illustrations of the working of a 
mind trained in the explanation of concrete phe- 
nomena of society. The paper on " The Standard 
of Life " is a trenchant treatment of a vital theme, 
and shows how definition and a certain ideal of 
comfort and culture help working people to stand 
firmly in the regulation of their own conduct and 
in facing the employers in unions. The criticism 
of a philanthropy which thoughtlessly helps to 
make wages lower is just and telling. The essay 
on the psychology of social progress is clearly writ- 
ten, and helps to grasp some of the elementary no- 
tions of social psychology. The treatment of the

education of women is instructive, without giving a 
new contribution to our knowledge. 

Full of social optimism and confidence in the 
regenerating power of kindergartens is Mr. Horace 
Fletcher, the genial friend of little children. " That 
Last Waif " is a phrase which shows confidence that 
the " unfit " are soon to disappear from the streets 
of our sodden cities. Perhaps the author has not 
counted in all the adverse forces which biologists and 
teachers are compelled to measure in their depths. 
Perhaps he has not made full account of heredity 
and the momentum of tradition. But then, he sees 
the hopeful side, and he urges the most timely meas- 
ure of progress. It is a pleasure to call attention 
to the scheme which the affable author calls " Social 
Quarantine " especially as all profits of his publi- 
cation go to kindergarten work. 

The little volume entitled " The Cry of the Chil- 
dren " draws its illustrations from English city life. 
The author has evidently studied at first-hand the 
occupations of young children in box making, belt 
and umbrella making, paper bags and sack making, 
artificial flower making, furniture polishing, and 
canal life. One may hope that this constant reitera- 
tion of the wrongs of children will help to promote 
the movements on their behalf kindergartens, 
parental schools, clubs, settlements, factory inspec- 
tion, compulsory education, and kindred measures.

England. haye cons id e rable difficulty in under- 

standing just what historical connection exists be- 
tween the subjects chosen for elaboration by Mr. 
Justin McCarthy in his " England in the Nineteenth 
Century " (Putnam). There are in the first volume 
eleven chapters, each treating of some interesting 
event or political movement, but each leaving the 
impression of a separate essay whose exact bearing 
on or relation to that which precedes or follows it 
is difficult to determine. Nor is the work as a whole 
up to Mr. McCarthy's usual standard. Never an 
exact historian, it is the less surprising that he re- 
peats at length the errors of the popular historian 
in the old tale of Canning's superlative prescience, 
and (by inference) Castlereagh's feeble grasp, .in 
diplomatic affairs. Canning is pictured as alone 
responsible for Enpland's emergence from the toils 
of the Holy Alliance, a fable long accepted by 
politicians, but never seriously asserted by any 
careful student of British state papers. Mr. Mc- 
Carthy's carelessness in historical statement is illus- 
trated also by his calm assertion of another historic 
lie, namely, that the Holy Alliance of 1815 did 
at that time definitely intend the suppression of all 
revolutionary movements in Europe. The chief 
merits of previous works by this author have been 



readableness and attractive characterizations ; and 
it is in respect to these features that the present 
work is not up to the usual standard. Haste is evi- 
dent in every chapter, and here and there extra- 
neous matter is inserted as if having come to mind 
at the moment of writing. The vim and movement 
usual with the author are utterly lacking, and the 
volume sinks to a dull level depressing in its effect 
upon the reader. Coming from Mr. McCarthy, the 
work is a distinct disappointment. The second 
volume (received since the above was written) in na 
way alters the opinion formed from a perusal of the 
first volume. Carelessness in language, in statement 
of fact, and in generalization, constitute its short- 
comings. For example, on page 171 of the second 
volume the misleading generalization, " the whole 
ambition of the Emperor Napoleon's life was to re- 
store the glories of the great Napoleonic time," is 
given, and in the same paragraph the inaccuracy of 
detail is shown in crediting to Prince Napoleon 
rather than to Thiers the saying that " the Emperor 
Napoleon III. had twice taken Europe in ! first 
when he made her to believe him to be a dullard, 
and next when he made her to believe him to be a 
statesman." On the whole, however, the second 
volume is more readable than the first, because of 
a better selection of topics illuminating England's 
history. Yet Mr. McCarthy's reputation for enter- 
taining and fairly accurate historical writing will; 
not be benefited by the present work. 

The translator of the critical essays 

Critical essays of M Ren Doumic hag done well in 

from the French. , 

taking no one book of his, but rather 
making a selection. M. Doumic's volumes have 
not, as a rule, much logical unity : they gather up 
the essays of a year or two, much as it may chance. 
In each volume a good many of the subjects are 
more interesting to the French reader than they 
would be to the American. But by selecting from 
several books the essays on the novelists, Miss Mary 
Frost has made an attractive collection in " Con- 
temporary French Novelists" (Crowell). People 
have heard more of French novelists than of French 
poets, preachers, or critics. So far as these latter 
are concerned, they have probably heard something 
of M. Doumic himself, because he was here in 
America a year ago, and because he writes for the 
" Revue des Deux Mondes." Those who regard 
that standard periodical as the cream of French lit- 
erature naturally regard M. Doumic as a critic both 
sound and rare. For ourselves, we have but a gen- 
eral interest in M. Doumic's criticism. It has not 
the attraction of the academic quality (so charac- 
teristic of France when it is at its best) that one 
may find in the work of M. Gaston Deschamps or 
M. Gustavo Larroumet, to mention but two critics 
who are in the habit of collecting their work. Nor 
has it the free-lance cheerfulness of M. Jules 
Lemaitre, or of that Thelemite of letters M. Ana- 
tole France. Nor has it the curious leaven that one 
may detect in the writing of M. Henry Bordeaux or

M. Paul Desjardins. Of course a man need not 
have these things, or anything like them, to be good. 
M. Brunetiere has not them ; he has something else. 
What has M. Rene" Doumic? Well, he is objective; 
he has chiefly facts and inferences. He regards 
literature as the product of men of letters ; there- 
fore, this book is on novelists rather than on novels. 
He has pretty definite ideas of what is worth doing, 
and a great deal of common sense ; so that his criti- 
cism, even if not very stimulating, is pretty sound. 
The present translation is not a model of excellence. 
Miss Frost has allowed herself various liberties : she 
has sometimes quite disregarded the original arrange- 
ment of paragraphs and sections, a matter about 
which modern French essayists are rather particu- 
lar ; she has always omitted a sentence or two when 
she felt like it ; she has sometimes overstepped the 
conventions of mood and tense, so as to offer us a 
freer translation than would be otherwise possible. 
We do not think, however, that she has anywhere 
really perverted the meaning of the original, so that 
those who want merely the ideas of the original will 
be pretty sure to find them. 

The fact that the regular diurnal

observed in varying degrees at all 

sea-ports, are caused by the moon and the sun, was 
ages ago recognized. The modern theories of grav- 
itation and of the translation of wave movements 
have accounted for most of the complicated and 
often contradictory phenomena, leaving yet much 
that is difficult of comprehension, so remote and so 
subtle are the influences in action. Professor George 
Howard Darwin, of Trinity, Cambridge, elucidates 
the subject in a well-devised course of lectures given 
in 1897 at the Lowell Institute in Boston, and now 
issued in book form by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. The range of the phenomena described and 
discussed is of the widest. From tidal activities 
detected in lakes and in enclosed seas, in the estua- 
ries of rivers, in the earth's interior, it extends to 
other planets, particularly to Saturn, to the forms of 
nebulae, and to the movements of double stars. The 
terrestrial tides are discussed as to their causes, 
their place of beginning and progressive movements, 
the prediction of their recurrence at specified ports, 
their influence upon the earth's figure, the periods 
of its rotation, and upon the revolution of the moon. 
On the crucial point, the attempt to show how the 
attraction of the moon can cause a heaping up of 
the waters upon the side of the earth opposite the 
moon involves the usual obscurity of representing a 
reversal of forces, as indicated in figure 22 on 
page 100. The influence of a centrifugal force, 
resulting from the revolution of the earth about the 
centre of gravity of the system composed of the 
earth and the moon, is brought into the account, 
properly of course, so far as it goes. But the cen- 
trifugal force generated in the time of a lunar revo- 
lution can have little part in the production of a re- 
sult like the reverse terrestrial tide which is a matter 



of daily occurrence. The key to the solution of the 
problem of the tidal form lies in the difference of 
the lunar force of attraction, as found at the centre 
of the earth and on the nearer and remoter surfaces. 
The distances of these representative particles from 
the moon vary as the numbers 51, 60, and 61, and 
the corresponding attractions vary as the squares of 
those numbers. The three particles may be figured 
by three boys holding to a rope and running in suc- 
cession with forces corresponding to their strength 
or to the influences arousing them. If the three 
were of equal strength there would be no strain upon 
the rope. If the foremost boy were stronger and 
the rear boy weaker than the middle boy, the fore- 
most will pull the middle boy forward ; while the 
rear boy, being unable to keep up, though running 
with all his might, seems to pull back. But for the 
rope which drags him along he would fall behind, 
as do the waters on the remote side of the earth. 
All the particles of the earth are falling toward the 
moon those on the nearer side with greater, those 
on the farther side with less, movement ; conse- 
quently they are distributed over a greater space in 
the direction of the lunar force. The resulting 
figure of the earth is a prolate spheroid, such as 
any body assumes when falling toward a centre of 
attraction. 

Memories ^ n "Wordsworth and the Coleridges " 

literary and ( Macmillan), Mr. Ellis Yarnall has 

political. written pleasantly of his acquaint- 

ance and friendship with some of the great men 
and women whom he met in the course of a long 
life. His recollections have to do with both En- 
gland and America, and date back in the one case 
to the coming of Lafayette to America in 1824 and 
in the other to his own visit to England for the 
first time in 1849. Of the ten chapters which make 
up the book, the four dealing with Wordsworth and 
the Coleridges Sara Coleridge and her two broth- 
ers, Hartley and Derwent Coleridge, and Sir John 
Taylor Coleridge and Lord Coleridge (late Lord 
Chief Justice of England) constitute the raison 
d'etre of the book. To these four chapters, which 
occupy about half the volume and give the work its 
title, are added various other memories, literary and 
political, treating of Charles Kingsley, John Keble, 
William Edward Forster, Oxford, and the House 
of Commons in the closing days of the American 
Civil War. Three of these chapters have been pre- 
viously published in a more or less complete form. 
Mr. Yarnall's acquaintance with the men he writes 
of, with one or two exceptions, seems to have been 
too slight to enable him to ascertain the distinctive 
traits of character possessed by each, a fact that 
has obliged him frequently to supplement his own 
opinions with those of others, and sometimes to 
introduce irrelevant matter into his book. His rec- 
ollections impress us as being those of a sympathetic 
and appreciative visitor to the homes and haunts of 
certain great men, rather than the memories of an 
intimate friend. On the other hand, Mr. Yarnall's

style is easy and natural, and he has written a very 
readable book. He has recorded many of the wise 
sayings which fell from the lips of the men and 
women he met, and he has related some interesting 
incidents that are worth remembering. He has also 
told us something of the awe with which most peo- 
ple came into the presence of Wordsworth ; some- 
thing, too, of the beautiful old age of Mrs. Words- 
worth; something of the traits of the wonderful 
author of " The Ancient Mariner " which could 
still be traced in the poet's children, Sara, Hartley, 
and Derwent Coleridge ; and a good deal about the 
late Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Coleridge, 
with whom Mr. Yarnall was on terms of cordial 
friendship and with whom he carried on a corre- 
spondence which extended over a period of thirty- 
seven years, all of which was well worth the telling. 

We are hardly familiar enough with 
The American ^e American acting drama of to-day

to be able to judge whether or not 
it is proper to regard Mr. Augustus Thomas's " Ala- 
bama" (Russell) as properly representative in a series 
that includes some of the finest dramatic work done 
of late in France and Germany. We should incline 
to hope (if nothing more) that we had something a 
little more serious to offer ; but we may demand 
more than there is. M. Rostand is certainly a dis- 
tinguished figure in the French drama of to-day, 
Hauptmann in the German : possibly America is fitly 
represented by Mr. Augustus Thomas. "Alabama" 
is an American play. It deals with peculiarly 
American situations, namely, such as might arise 
in the influx of Northern capital and energy into 
the South, some twenty years after the war. It 
deals with American characters, too ; Northern men 
of business and Southern planters. The play is 
thus perhaps as representatively American as any- 
thing we have, although personally we should have 
preferred one of Mr. Harrigan's Irish and Negro 
conglomerates, or one of Mr. Hoyt's racy eccentric- 
ities, or something like " The Old Homestead " or 
" Shore Acres." These plays seem to us to be more 
typical of some aspects of our civilization than 
"Alabama" is of others. Yet there is no use 
grumbling in such an embarrassment of riches. 
Perhaps the courage of Mr. Thomas in printing his 
play will lead others to follow his example. It is 
the first step that costs : we hope it will not cost 
Mr. Thomas and Mr. Russell very much, for we 
want to see more American dramas in print. 



Completion of The ^ na ^ instalment (Volume III.) 
Ratzeiv* Hittory of Prof essor Ratzel's great work on 
of Mankind. Tne History of Mankind" in an 

English dress (Macmillan ) presents the same char- 
acteristics as the preceding volumes, which have 
been fully noticed in these columns. The present 
volume is loaded with good cuts of ethnic types and 
ethnographic objects, and is supplied with some ex- 
cellent colored plates and maps. In Book IV. the 
discussion of the Negro Races is completed by 



chapters upon the Africans of the Interior and the 
West Africans. The final division of the work, 
Book V., deals with the Cultured Races of the Old 
World. In following the discussion of African ne- 
groes, we are constantly impressed by their political 
instability : how many kingdoms have risen sud- 
denly to power, and as suddenly have disappeared, 
leaving no trace ! Preliminary to the study of the 
Cultured Races of Africa and Asia, the author con- 
siders the desert and nomadism most suggestively. 
Islam and its influence are fairly treated. Consid- 
ering the great size of the work, the conditions de- 
scribed are astonishingly up to date. Recent 
political events in Africa and Asia are taken into 
the account. The discussion of China social and 
religious is good ; that of the European peoples 
is less notable. In a work of so wide scope, full 
and detailed accounts of peoples cannot be expected : 
Professor Ratzel has done wonderfully well in giving 
so much as he does. The subject and plan of the 
work necessitated dry and terse statement. Still, 
it is unfortunate that Ratzel could not have fallen 
into the hands of a better translator. The English 
could hardly be more difficult and obscure ; the 
author's meaning is sometimes lost ; the grammar 
is bad. The translator does not appear to know 
either authors or literature. He several times re- 
fers to Crawfurd as Crawford. Where English 
authors are quoted, it appears that their original 
statement is not looked up, but is retranslated. 
These translator's faults, manifest and constant, 
will prevent this English edition of volkerkunde 
from becoming popular. The work is, however, too 
valuable to students to be neglected, and will become 
an important book of reference. 

Mr. Max Beerbohm has been rather 
ingenious in making criticism on his 

f> 

later book " More (John Lane) im- 
possible. In criticism of any such book the all- 
important thing is point of view. Now the most 
obvious point of view for the critic of Mr. Beerbohm 
to take is that of Mr. Beerbohm himself : a proceed- 
ing quite out of the question, not because it would be 
difficult, but because it would be imitative and there- 
fore silly in anyone except the gifted author. And 
any other point of view would also be impossible, for 
it would have to be either in earnest or not. One can- 
not, of course, consider these bits in earnest. And 
if one is to think of them affectedly, one is practic- 
ally in the position of trying to go beyond Mr. Beer- 
bohm or else to vary from him, neither of which 
acts is self-respecting. We say nothing, then, ex- 
cept that one should not read these essays in a rage. 
This may seem a needless caution, but Mr. Beer- 
bohm's earlier labors did arouse rage in some hearts. 
These latter works will not be likely to do so ; in 
fact, in our heart they have aroused on the whole 
pleasure. One thing only we rather regret: we 
are quite unable to regard Mr. Beerbohm as a great 
thinker, veiling his ideas under a trivial form. We 
find a good many very sensible remarks here and

a delver after truth. He has no message to his 
time ; and that is a pity. The gifted man whom 
he so sedulously imitates did have a message, though 
he would have been zealous in denying the fact. 
Perhaps further and more careful study of Mr. 
Beerbohm would have shown that he has one, too; 
but we doubt it. Still, we commend a study of

ance to do. The book is of a size suitable for a

ollection. " The Bon Gualtier Bal- 
lads " have hardly survived the half-century, and 
" The Course of Time " has had even a shorter life. 
Yet Mrs. Masson's volume on these two " Famous 
Scots " ( imported by Scribner ) is worth reading 
for all that. It is a book which is more interesting 
on account of the considerations it gives rise to, than 
on account of the facts it details. These two men 
may be said to be a typical pair : the one, a poor 
and hard-working Scotch ploughboy student, work- 
ing at divinity and literature by the hardest toils, 
and reaching fame and position only a short season 
before his death ; the other, the well-to-do man of 
literary tastes and inclinations, passing a pleasant 
and appreciated life as contributor to " Black- 
wood's " and professor of belles-lettres. By all proper 
expectation, the former should be the real genius 
whose poetic fire still shines for the delectation of 
lovers of letters, and the latter should be merely the 
literary man of the hour whose productions have 
closely followed him into obscurity. The fact is, 
however, that the hard-working genius and the well- 
to-do litterateur are both forgotten, one almost as 
thoroughly as the other, with the odds against the 
genius. It is curious how often poetic justice is 
foiled. In spite of the prosaic harshness of destiny, 
Mrs. Masson's book is, as we have said, pleasant to 
turn over. We might think her a bit frivolous in 
her manner of dealing with so sacred a topic as a 
man of genius ; still, this is better than taking the 
matter too seriously. Beside the frivolities and the 
necessities of her narrative, she often turns a good 
phrase on her own account " the opal wonders of 
the Western Highlands," for instance. 

When we last wrote of Mrs. Meynell, 
Mn. Mtymivt ag we rememD er, we regretted a little 

new volume. 6 . 

that her work was becoming better 
known. Literary likings have three phases : first, 
they are enthusiasms ; then, cults ; then, fashions. 
All literary likings do not go through these three 
phases. The " Rubaiyat," however, is a very per- 
fect instance of all : first, in the seventies, when it 
was the passion of a few individuals ; then, in the 
eighties, when it was the esoteric possession of various 
coteries ; now, in the nineties, when it has become 
an ordinary drawing-room dissipation. Mr. Kipling, 
however, skipped the second stage, and some people 



have skipped the first as well. Browning will never 
reach the third, and Landor will never get even to 
the second. To return to Mrs. Meynell, who is on 
the border-land between a sincere enthusiasm and a 
cult. In certain circles it is getting necessary to 
"know" Mrs. Meynell, meaning, of course, her 
writings ; and we regret that pleasure in Mrs. 
Meynell's essays should become compulsory. Mrs. 
Meynell is an essayist of a high order. She does 
not sit among pigeonholes, like Miss Repplier, and 
decoct the choice treasure of her cells ; nor drop 
bunches of artificial grass about the floors of modern 
salons, like Miss Guiney. She has her own mode 
of distinction, a mode that we tried to describe some 
time ago. It is a mode that demands something of 
reader as well as writer, demands not more than 
it gives, certainly, but more than do most of the 
recent essays which are too often only the weekly 
wool-gathering of some mind that has wandered 
much in literature and life. We said, some years 
since, that the interest in Mrs. Meynell's essays lay 
largely in the temperament that they conveyed, in 
their quality. We think that this may be said of 
" The Spirit of Place " (John Lane) ; nor does it 
seem to us that the quality has changed in the last 
few years, or that its mode of expression has become 
less delicate and sure. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The " Cambridge " Milton (Houghton) is uniform 
with the other poets included in this favorite and inex- 
pensive edition that is, it forms a single volume with 
double-columned pages, has a portrait frontispiece, a 
compact body of notes, and an introductory essay. The 
latter, as well as the editing in general, comes from Mr. 
William Vaughan Moody, who has also provided prose 
translations of the Latin poems. Mr. Moody's intro- 
duction, considered both as biography and criticism, is 
an excellent piece of work. 

Mr. George Burton Adams's handbook of European 
History (Macmillan) should be of great value to teach- 
ers of history, for it contains in concise form just the 
material required in outlining for students the supple- 
mentary reading necessary in each epoch. The work is not 
in itself sufficiently expanded to be used as a text-book, 
indeed, it was not the author's intention that it should 
be so used, but taken as a basis for a lecture course, 
or for the seminary method of study, it will serve as the 
best of guides. It is particularly strong in well-selected 
references to such works in English, or in translation, 
as are easily obtainable, at small expense, by any school 
or college library. 

The following French texts are of recent publication: 
Augier et Sandeau's " Le Gendre de M. Poirier " (Holt), 
edited by Dr. Stuart Symington; a " Precis de 1'His- 
toire de France" (Macmillan), by Professor Alce'e 
Fortier; and an abbreviated " Histoire de Gil Bias de 
Santillane " (Heath), prepared by Professors Adolphe 
Colin and Robert Sanderson. An Italian text is Gol- 
doni's " Un Curioso Accidente " (Heath), edited by Dr. 
J. D. M. Ford, who also edits a Spanish text of " El Si 
de las Miiias " (Ginn), by Mdratin.

LITERARY NOTES. 

Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. publish a school edition 
of " The Ancient Mariner," edited by Dr. John Phelps 
Fruit. 

Mr. Moses Grant Daniell has edited for Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. a school edition of Macaulay's " Lays of Ancient 
Home." 

" Scotland's Share in Civilizing the World," by the 
Rev. Canon Mackenzie, is a recent publication of the 
Fleming H. Revell Co. 

The Macmillan Co. send us " Bible Stories " from the 
New Testament, edited by Mr. R. G. Moulton, and pub- 
lished in " The Modern Reader's Bible." 

A " Glossary to Accompany Departmental Ditties ' 
as written by Rudyard Kipling " is the title of a small 
book just published by Messrs. M. F. Mansfield and 
A. Wessels. 

" Retrospects and Prospects " (Scribner) is a posthu- 
mous volume of miscellaneous essays by Sidney Lanier, 
collected from various sources, and primarily historical 
in their interest. 

" The Athenian Archons of the Third and Second 
Centuries before Christ," by Mr. William Scott Fergu- 
son, appears as Volume X. of the " Cornell Studies in 
Classical Philology," published by the Macmillan Co. 

" The Metaphor : A Study in the Psychology of 
Rhetoric," by Miss Gertrude Buck, is published by the 
Ann Arbor Inland Press, in the series of " Contributions 
to Rhetorical Theory," edited by Professor Fred Newton 
Scott. 

" A History of the American Nation " (Appleton), by 
Professor Andrew C. McLaughlin, is a text book of a 
highly satisfactory sort, intended for secondary schools. 
It comes down to the war in the Philippines, and is 
copiously illustrated with maps and portraits. 

Mr. L. G. Bugbee sends us pamphlet reprints of two 
papers on Texas history. " Slavery in Early Texas " 
first appeared in the " Political Science Quarterly " and 
" Some Difficulties of a Texas Empresario " in the pub- 
lications of the Southern History Association. Both are 
interesting and important contributions to the annals of 
the State. 

A paper on " International Courts of Arbitration," 
written in 1874 by Thomas Balch of Philadelphia, and 
published in the London " Law Magazine and Review," 
has now, owing to the renewed timeliness of its theme, 
been reissued in book form by Messrs. Henry T. Coates 
& Co., and edited by Mr. Thomas Willing Balch, a son 
of the author. 

Burke's " Conciliation " speech, edited by Mr. Sidney 
Carleton Newsom; Goldsmith's "Vicar of Wakefield," 
edited by Mr. Henry W. Boynton ; and Dryden's " Pala- 
mon and Arcite," edited by Mr. Percival Chubb, are 
recent additions to the Messrs. Macmillan's series of 
" Pocket English Classics." 

The proceedings of the Chicago anti-imperialist meet- 
ing of April 30 have just been published in a pamphlet 
of about fifty pages, and constitute an impressive and 
weighty statement of the reasons which have impelled 
the larger part of the sober-minded public to protest 
against the war in the Philippine Islands. The addresses 
of President Rogers, Bishop Spaulding, Professor 
Laughlin, and the other speakers, are given in full, and 
the whole is issued as the first of a series of " Liberty 
Tracts " to be published by the Central Anti-Imperialist 



League. Copies of the pamphlet may be obtained from 
Mr. Edwin Burritt Smith, 415 First National Bank 
Building, Chicago. 

In speaking of the new edition of Baedeker's " United 
States" (Scribner), we find that we hardly did justice 
to the revisions that have been made since the first edi- 
tion was published. They include six new maps and 
plans, new railway routes, revised statements of Mexi- 
can and Alaskan routes, an extended bibliography, and 
an account of Greater New York. On the other hand, the 
vigilance of the editor has not been sufficient to avoid 
an occasional slip, such as the naming at the head of the 
list of Chicago hotels and restaurants of an establish- 
ment that ceased to exist some two years ago.
