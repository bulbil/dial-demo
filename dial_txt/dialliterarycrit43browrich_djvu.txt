NOTES 21 

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 22 



— t6e fallac y of specialism. 

We are often reminded of the fact that this 
is the age of the specialist, and that success in 
any field of endeavor, whether material or 
intellectual, is not likely to be attained save 
as the result of thorough equipment in some 
specialized department of activity. The more 
restricted the region chosen for research and 
its practical applications, the more nearly com- 
plete is the monopoly of knowledge and skill, 
and the more certainly can the specialist make 
his own terms with the world that has need of 
his services. The logic of this situation is too 
obvious to need enforcement, and countless 
iUustrations of the advantage in question will 
occur to every reader. Yet, sound as this 
reasoning may be fundamentaUy, it is fre- 
quently made a starting-point for fallacious 
inferences that work no little confusion to the 
judgment, and that sometimes become fairly 
mischievous in their effect. In a general way, 
it may be said that this effect is analogous to 
the physical phenomentm of irradiation, which 
unconsciously persuades us that an illuminated 
area is considerably larger than actual measure- 
ment would indicate. 

Before discussing this point, however, we 
wish to make it perfectly clear that we can 
have no quarrel with the most narrowly special- 
ized knowledge as such, even with knowledge 
that is seemingly of little or no practical use. 
Our sympathies have always been on the side 



of the legendary humanist who 



thanks 



because the English universities taught nothing 
that was useful (as men vulgarly employ that 
term"), and we long since took to heart the 
teaching that the attainment of truth is a 
worthy end in itself, irrespective of its possible 
bearings upon conduct or worldly success. The 
possessor of exact knowledge of any kind, the 
one who knows whereof he speaks, is the truest 
benefactor of man, and the credulous or vagrant 
instincts implanted in most human beings cannot 
be called too sternly to accoxmt, or too strictly 
subjected to the discipline of science. The mis- 
chief done to intellectual integrity by a wanton 
disregard of fact, by slovenly habits of reasoning, 
imd by the intrusion of prejudice into judgment, 
is in any case so enormous that we dare not 
speak slightingly of those whose influence serves 



:the dial 



[July 1, 



as a corrective of the evil, although they may 
sometimes seem to us shrivelled up by pedantiy, 
and possessed of weazened apologies for souls. 

Having made this disclaimer, we will revert 
to our metaphor of irradiation. When a man 
has attained gi-eat eminence in some department 
of knowledge, even a narrow one, it is difficidt 
to disabuse ourselves of the notion that his 
ideas upon any subject must be illuminating. 
A famous physicist declares his belief in " spirit- 
ualism," and the fact that he is a famous 
physicist makes many people think that the case 
of the spook is strengthened by his confession. 
A distinguished naturalist dabbles in socialism 
or astronomy, and his fantastic imaginings are 
taken seriously just becaiLse he is a distinguished 
naturalist. A great teacher of ethics proclaims 
his conviction that the world's estimate of 
Shakespeare is absurdly exaggerated, and the 
opinion is thought to have a certain weight 
merely for the reason that it has been pro- 
nounced by a profound moralist. In all such 
cases, we fall victims to the fallacious inference 
that authority upon one subject dignifies pro- 
noimcements upon any other, bestowing upon 
them a greater significance than could be given 
them by the average man. This trait of popular 
psychology is well luiderstood by editors of 
newspapers and magazines, by spokesmen of 
every sort of propaganda, and by all the shrewd 
host of those who have wares to advertise. Few 
people realize the extent to which the intel- 
lectual life, even of really great men, is con- 
ducted by a system of water-tight compartments, 
whereby it becomes quite possible for supersti- 
tion and clear-visioned science to have joint 
occupancy of the same bi-ain-tenement. And 
with men whose distinction rests upon a nar- 
rower basis, it is quite possible for one part of 
the intellectual mechanism to be in perfect 
working order, while the other parts exhibit 
loose screws and faulty adjustment. 

What we have called the fallacy of specialism 
is still more likely to escape detection when the 
case under observation, instead of concerning 
widely separated departments of knowledge, 
concerns only the different divisions of what, 
to the general view, seems to be one and the 
same area. A physician, for example, may have 
exceptional skUl in diagnosis, and yet his knowl- 
edge of the other subjects required by his pro- 
fession may be so defective as to make him an 
uncertain practitioner. A lawj'er may be pro- 
foundly versed in the principles of the civil law, 
and yet find himself all at sea in dealing with 
common-law cases. The most striking illustrar 



tion of this one-sided equipment that comes to 
our mind is offered by the .specialists who con- 
duct the instruction in English (to say nothing 
of other languages and literatures) in our uni- 
versities. In nine cases out of ten the instructor's 
credentials for the performance of his function 
are supplied by some fragment of technical 
linguistic investigation or the critical examina^ 
tion of some obscure author or exceptionally 
barren period of the literature. But the actual 
task which he has in hand is to acquaint yoimg 
people with the principles of literary art, to 
help them interpret the master-minds of the 
race, and to Inspire them with an enthusiasm 
for stately prose and noble poetry. Never was 
there a more evident malatljustment of means 
to ends ; never was there a more glaring illus- 
tration of the undistributed middle than is found 
in the argiunent which would prove these men 
fitted to these f mictions. To be a specialist in 
Gower or in the Northumbrian dialect of Old 
English — so runs the argument — Is a warrant 
of competency to expound the divine humanity 
of Shakespeare, the political wisdom of Burke, 
and the flawless art of Tennyson ! 

We are tempted to add to this discussion a 
few words upon what may not unfairly be styled 
the arrogance of specialism. The man who is 
conscious of knowing more than other scholars 
about some special subject is pretty apt to mag- 
nify his own importance, and to affect (perhaps 
really to feel) only scorn for those men who 
believe that breadth of view and philosophical 
grasp are more to be desired than any of the 
ends of specialism. He regards himself and his 
feUow-specIallsts as the only properly accredited 
members of the guild of scholarship, and lias 
at his command an array of contemptuous 
epithets for those who pretend to scholarly dis- 
tinction upon any other basis. Whoever woiUd 
rashly enter the sacred bounds without a doc- 
toral dissertation for a passport must be sent 
about his business, must be forced to haunt for- 
ever the limbo of amateurs. It was only the 
other day that we were reading in a specialist 
journal the review of a recent work of literary 
biography and interpretation. The work is 
an admirable one in every respect, and this 
the reviewer was honest enough to allow. But 
he could not refrain from expressing his plain- 
tive regret that it was not written by a 
Fachmann, even although the work might have 
been no better done. More effective than any 
labored exposition of the specialist's attitude 
toward the rest of mankind is the naive revela- 
tion afforded by this incident.

THE DIAL 



THE WEATHER IN LITERATURE. 

Calveriey thought that if such braTC rhymes of 
the olden time as " weather " and " together " were 
bwidled up and carted away, there woold be fewer 
volumes of verse. If the weather it»elf were to be 
eliminated from literatore, both prose and verse 
would show lacunje almost as groit as the space 
between the stars is to the stars themselves. The 
weather is the chief subject of human interest and 
intercourse. We b^in every conversation with pro- 
pitiatory or damnatory remarks about it We study 
its signs and signal its arrival or departure as 
though it were a royal guest. And rightly : for on 
the weather depends our harvests, our healths, our 
intellects, and our complexions. Whether we are 
Caucasian or Negro depends upon the intensity of 
our suns. Whether we are energetic or languid 
depends upon the quality of our atmoephere. We 
are all servUe to the skyey influences. 

A railroad train hurtles straight to the west and 
the sinking sun, like an arrow towards a shield- 
In a meadow at one side, a herd of horses breaks 
into frightened flight. A bird darts upward, sing- 
ing as though it would burst its breast. A young 
girL in whose eyes sleep the visions and images of 
the future, looks out from a cottage porch. All 
these varj-ing forms of force draw tJieir power from 
yonder reddened orb about to be obscured. 

Nothing exists, that we can apprehend, but the 
human spirit and the weather. All the phenomena 
of nature are only more advanced and stationary 
stages of weather. Spring belts the world with 
a band of blossoms which resembles the delicate or 
daring hues of dawn. The green mantle of Summer 
reechoes the blue of cloudless skies; and Autumn, 
with its purples and yellows and reds, mocks the 
sunset fires. The rivers and lakes and oceans are 
only a thicker kind of mist. The mountains them- 
selves are but secular clouds. If we could imagine 
a slow-lived being to whom centuries were but as 
our moments, we could think of him watching the 
eternal hills heaving and changing and crumbling 
away, just as we watch the storm-doods of our 
atmosphere. 

Every age is conceited about some one thing 
above the rest — usually with little eanse. The age 
of Louis Xr\'. thought it had perfected polite civ- 
ilization. The age of the French Revolution thought 
it had discovered Liberty. Equality, and Fraternity. 
Our age has been prouder, perhaps, of patronizing 
Nature than of anything else. Yet the Greeks 
studied natural effects with keener eyes than ours. 
The Romans were as much in love with country 
life as we are. Their villas were scattered all 
around the Mediterranean and among Alpine and 
Apennine hills. And under the early Christian 
regune, every dell and desert place had its hermit 
Perhaps Ruskin is right in thinking that neither of 
these races cared much for the higher mountain 
solitudes or the gloom of deep woods. But our 
Aryan ancestors or relatives who poured across the 



Himalayas were familiar with heights to which 
the mountains of Europe were mole-hills. They 
knew intimately forests to which our stateliest 
woods are toad-holes compared to temples. Their 
earliest gods were purely incarnations of physical 
phenomena. — India of the sky, Sniya of the sun, 
Agni of fire itself : the Shining Ones these. It was 
not until later that thb triad became metaphysicized 
into Vishnu. Brahma, and Siva. The Mamts were 
the storm-gods. The Apsaras and Gandharvas 
were the clouds turned into beautiful and friendly 
maidens and attendant youths. And from the woods 
arose dreadful Rakshasas, demons who contended 
not unequally with the golden gods. 

The difference between the ancients' way of view- 
ing Nature and our own is simply that they saw 
physical phenomena alive, animated with will and 
thought and pa^on ; whereas we see them a mere 
catalogue of dead things. We are content to assume 
that intellect belongs to ntan alone, just as if we were 
absolutely certain that an oak-tree has no intelligence, 
or that the ocean does not know what it is about 
when it rises in rage and dashes our vessels down 
to shipwreck. For the purposes of literature, at 
any rate, the old beliefs were better than ours. 
Where we only see a round ball blazing in the 
sky and cooking mankind with its fiery rays, they 
saw the angry Apollo striding from his Olympian 
halls with the bow in his hand and the arrows rat- 
tling on his shoulders. Where we only hear the 
thunder crashing Uirou^ the sky, they saw the 
terrible King of Gods lifting his majestic bead and 
hurling the bolts from his right hand. Where we 
only see the level floor of the ocean, they saw sleek 
Panope and all her sisters playing upon it We 
think we have got at the causes of things. — but 
really we do not know why different seeds produce 
each after its own kind, or why carbon and hydrogen 
combine in various proportions to form organic sub- 
stances. Why should not our elements or atoms or 
deetnins be the sentient forbears of many conscious 
races which unite, marry, oppose, or strive with each 
other, and in certain of their exhibitions arise to a 
divinity beyond the reach of man ? 

But of course it is nonsense to snppose that 
modem literature has done away with the super- 
ualunL Gods and goddesses sprung from and guid- 
ing the processes of nature, and interfering in the 
affairs of men, have to some extent been driven off. 
But their place has been taken bj angels, devils, 
witches, fairies, ghosts, and a thousand other forms 
of spiritual life. More important stiU. modem 
writers have given a soul to inanimate things ; they 
have brought nature into sympathy with man. they 
have harmonized their backgrounds with the action 
of the central figures, they have invented tone in 
literature or at least have practised it to a far greater 
extent than the ancients. 

It is recorded of the late Queen Victoria, that she 
objected to what she called " dark " plays — meaning 
pieces where the backgrounds were sombre and the 
lighting obscure. It is creditable to her critical in- 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



stinct that she divined the fact of there being such 
a totality of effect. The majority of writers have 
never made a guess at it. Where tone is apparent 
at all in literature, it may be divided mto dark or 
bright effects, or a mingling and contrast of the two. 

" Macbeth " is probably the most magnificent 
sombre tone-piece in literature. There are high lights 
in it, but they are awe-inspiring, unearthly, hellish. 
From the windy, cloudy sunset on the heath ( it is 
sunset, for Macbeth says, " So fair and foul a day 
I have not seen ") to the storm and lightning that 
presage and accompany the murder, to the fires and 
boiling cauldrons of the Witches' cave, to the ghost- 
like Lady Macbeth with her solitary candle, all the 
lights only accentuate the gloom and horror, the 
outward and inward tumult of the play. 

Scott's " Bride of Lammermoor" is keyed to a 
twilight melancholy rather than a stormy might. 
There is an autumnal haze about it through which 
the gaunt trees of the Master's lost estate, his 
dilapidated house, and even its gi'im steward of 
starvation, Caleb Balderstone, show half spectral and 
unreal. It is only in the dreadfully hinted story 
of the bridal night, and the Master's death in the 
ravening sands, that the thing leaps into tragedy. 

Dickens's " Barnaby Rudge " has two centres of 
light — the Maypole Inn and the Varden household. 
Around these whirl and surge the shadows of the 
story — the mysteries of the murder, Barnaby and 
his raven, that uncanny modern Caliban, Hugh, the 
Grordon riots, and all the rest of the gloomy turmoil. 
Grood as these things are, and whether Dickens 
intended it or not, they only serve to isolate and 
bring out the lighted parts of the picture, which by 
contrast acquire an inexpressible charm. It is doubt- 
ful if Dickens ever painted anything with more mel- 
low depth of tone than the Maypole Inn. Its wide 
hospitable spread of wings without, its cosy snugness 
within, its host and his crowd of village cronies, give 
the very sentiment and soul of inn-life once for all. 
And the companion picture, the household of the 
joUy locksmith, is aU sparkle and vivacity, cvdmi- 
nating in the rosy cheeks and many-colored garb of 
Dolly herself. Coming upon either of these scenes 
out of the darkness that surrounds them is like hap- 
pening upon a camp-fire in a forest at night. The 
great black tree-boles encircle it, the foliage keeps 
even the starlight away, but there on the shadow- 
sifted sward is a little heart of warmth and comfort. 

There is probably no piece of pure sunlight in 
literatm-e so perfect as Shakespeare's " Twelfth 
Night." It is hardly real sunlight, hardly even 
the sunlight of Greek poetry ; it is a half enchanted 
sunlight that turns even the ugly or the common to 
favor and prettiness. In the " Merchant of Venice " 
there is more contrast ; dark passions and stormy 
scenes intervene, making the play more picturesque 
and less serenely beautiful : but in the end aU the 
jarring elements are hushed into perfect peace and 
rest. 

This adjustment of environment and lighting to 
human action — the interpenetration of nature and 



man — which I have called tone, is present in 
Greek literature mainly by fits and starts. I can- 
not recall any single piece, except perhaps the 
Bacchanals of Euripides, where it is a predominant 
technical quality. In the night-raid of Diomed, in 
the Iliad, in the Nausikaa scenes of the Odyssey, 
there is the perfection of tone; but these passages 
are far from giving the keynotes of either poem. 
And similarly with the Dido episode in the .^neid, 
and the hero's descent into the underworld. They 
are only two of the many quite discordant elements 
out of which Virgil's poem is made. If we con- 
sider Dante's great work to be three separate poems, 
we shall find each of them marvellously toned to 
one predetermined effect. The black air of hell, 
lit by the red towers of Dis, lit by the fiery pyres of 
the sentenced sinners, lit by the falling flakes of 
fire, lit by those ineffable figures of God's mes- 
sengers drawn in hues of dawn against the dark 
background, — all this, in the first poem, is har- 
mony or intensifying contrast of hue. Nor is the 
" Purgatorio " inferior in total effect with its 
more eartlily and human, yet penitential, lights and 
shadows. And the " Paradiso " is one blaze of 
light, with hardly enough shadow to define the 
figures and objects. 

The human figure and its surroundings — these 
are the factors of literature. God must always be 
represented as supernatural nature or superhuman 
man. Sometimes, as in Wordworth, the natural phe- 
nomena crowd man out of the canvas — mountains are 
the heroes, cataracts the heroines of the work ; some- 
times, as in most social comedy, nature is an almost 
invisible frame to hold together the crowd of human 
actors ; sometimes, as in the very central art of 
Shakespeare, the earthy platform and its aerial dis- 
tances are a floor and backgi-ound which change and 
answer to the passions of the predominant soul of 
man ; sometimes, as in Greek literature, this back- 
ground is itself alive, and, taking a hundred human 
shapes, thrusts itself into the action. 

To carry the subject a little further, what are the 
probable effects on a national literature of thirty 
degrees of latitude ? I mean, how wUl the various 
climates of our country, ranging from a half-arctic 
desolation to tropic bloom and splendor, work them- 
selves out in our literary production? Most of the 
gi'eat literatures of the world have arisen in countries 
of circumscribed area and undiversified climate. 
However great may have been their voyagings of 
imagination, however vast the piratical spoils they 
may have brought back, the stamp of one home is 
impressed upon each. Thus, Hindu literature sprang 
from the gi'eat jungle at the foot of the Himalayas. 
The depths of those forests, the height of those hills, 
were impressed upon it. Greek poetry was the child 
of the carved hills of Attica, of the sunny Ionian 
isles. No matter what excursions it made into the 
savage or the unknown, it never lost its clear out- 
lines and serene air. The Scandinavian and Celtic 
literatures were born under the great forests, under 
the great mists, under the dark mountains of the

CASUAL COMMENT. 



In pr.\ise of fictios axd fictios-readehs 
the prevailing tone of Mr. Arthur E. Bostwick's ad- 
dress at the late convention of the American Library 
Association at Asheville, X. C. The speaker, who is 
one of the librarians of the New York Public Library, 
has had ample opportunity to study his subject, and his 
utterances were among the least hackneyed that were 
beard in the whole course of the convention. Mr. 
Bostwick is intelligently optimistic, and refuses to be 
alarmed by the eighty-four per cent of fiction that his 
library circulated last year. The demand for narrative 
literature he beUeves to be indicative of a healthy ap- 
petite ; for is not narrative the principal part of history, 
biography, and travel — and, he might have added, of 
epic poetry? He holds that not all book-drunkards are 
novel-readers; but that science and philosophy have 
their topers, and even mathematics may debauch the 
brain. He denies that a Ubrary's chief aim should be 
to circulate non-fiction. ^Vhile we may regret to see a 
young lady reading Laura Jean Libbey rather than 
Henry James, we can yet comfort ourselves with the 
reflection that probably her mother read less estimable 
books than Miss Libbey's — or, as he might again have 
added, no books at all, but only the newspapers. There 
is no cause for despair, we are assured. Romance has 
its place as dessert in the feast of reason, and it has 
been scientifically proved that even sugar is a food. 
Mr. Bostwick, we are glad to note in conclusion, is the 
newly-elected president of the A. L. A.

The protest agatsst "Shakespeare," from the 
pen of Mr. Clement Shorter, eUcits from our Cambridge 
Shakespeare scholar (for both Cambridges have their 
distinguished editors of the Stratford playwright) a 
vigorous counter-protest. Mr. William J. Rolfe says 
in a published letter: " Of course the dispute will con- 
tinue till the crack of doom, but I believe ' Shakespeare ' 
wUl hold its own as the Uterary form of the name. . . . 
Of the five indisputable autographs that survive, one 
b clearly 'Shakspere'; another is either that or 
' Shakspeare ' ; a third (on his will) is so faded that 
it cannot be certainly deciphered, but a fac-simile of 
1776 indicates that it was 'Shakspere'; the fourth 
and fifth (also on the will) have been read both as 
' Shakspere ' and ' Shakspeare,' but Sidney Lee says 
that close examination proves that the fifth is ' Shake- 
speare.' The dedications to ' Venus and Ad<mis ' and 
' Lucrece,' the only works of the poet that were cer- 
tainly seen through the press by himself, are both 
agned ■ William Shakespeare.' This is also the spell- 



ing on the title-pages of the forty or more editions of 
single plays printed during his lifetime (with only two 
exceptions), and of the four foho editions of the col- 
lected plays published after his death. It is the form 
almost unanimously adopted in the published references 
to him in the seventeenth century. It appears in many, 
if not most, of the old legal documents relating to him; 
as, for instance, in the license granted to him and his 
fellow-players by King James in 1603. It is also the 
spelling accepted by the great majority of the editors, 
commentators and critics of the last century." " Shake- 
speare " then let it be, even if '• Shakspere " does save 
ink, as Sarah Duchess of Marlborough said in explain- 
ing why she left her ('s uncrossed and her fs undotted.

A TBSTAXKSTARY cuRioeiTY has been going the 
rounds of the press, and most readers are now familiar 
with it. Perhaps fewer are aware that this alleged will 
of one Charles Lounsbury — who is represented as hav- 
ing been an occupant of an asylum for the insane at 
Dunning, HI., and whose generous bequest of all out- 
doors to the children made such charming reading — 
was a harmless hoax perpetrated in an idle moment by 
a Chicago lawyer, Mr. Williston Fish, and printed in 
" Harper's Weekly " nine years ago. Besides being 
widelv quoted, this bright httle piece was made the sub- 
ject of an editorial recently by the New York " Inde- 
pendent," and at a late dinner of the alumni association 
of the Xew York Law University, Judge Walter Lloyd 
Smith, of Elmira, read aloud this remarkable will, com- 
menting admiringly on its several clauses. Sundry 
newspapers have reprinted it, and the superintendent 
of the Dunning Asylum has been overwhelmed with 
inquiries concerning his supposed patient. Mr. Fish, 
who is a graduate of West Point, is reported as saying 
of himself and his writings: " My army life gave me an 
opportunity to write. I used to write for ' Puck ' and 
' life,' and ' A Last Will ' was just one of those little 
fancies that sometimes occur to you. It was published, 
paid for, and, as I believed, forgotten." Curiously 
enough, Mr. Fish had a great-grandfather named 
Charles Lounsbury; and perhaps to this ancestor he 
owes some part of that happy endowment that enables 
him, in his leisure half -hours, to throw off these " little 
fancies." ... 

A JEWEL IX A DCST-HEAP, tumed up by the prod 
of some humble delver for unconsidered trifles, could 
hardlv have brought greater surprise and joy to the 
finder than did the recent chance discovery, by a London 
dealer in second-hand books, of a perfect copy of Gabriel 
Thomas's " Account of the Province and Country of 
Pennsvlvania and of West-New-Jersey in America," 
with dedication to " Friend William Penn," published 
in London two hundred and nine years ago. This 
ancient volume, valuable as the earUest historically 
important work on Pennsylvania and as having a rare 
old map of the colonies, was one of several score old 
books purchased in a lump for a few shillings. But 
not for some time after examining his treasure did the 
lucky finder recognize its full worth. " He was even so 
reckless as to offer it for sale at a beggarly £5. For- 
tunatelv for him no connoisseur in Americana chanced 
that way before he had come to his senses; and he now 
hopes to get £160 for it, the price for which a copy 
was sold at Sotheby's not long ago. In this connection 
it may be interesting to note the reported discovery 
some months since, at a bookstall in the Mile-£nd 
Road — a shabby and unpromising neighborhood — of

a volume of Molifere which the unalert proprietor gladly 
parted with for twopence halfpenny, and which was later 
sold for £31. Who shall say that the era has passed 
for realizing great and sudden fortunes, or that the Old 
World does not vie with the New in money-making 
opportunities ? ... 

Pragmatism and metaphysics appear to be related 
to each other somewhat as are works and faith. The 
high priest of pragmatism, the new philosophy, is 
(in this country) the distinguished psychologist. Dr. 
William James, who is said to have resigned his 
Harvard professorship in order to devote himself wholly 
to the propagation of the new gospel. As fellow- 
workers in the cause he has Dr. Paul Cams, able editor 
of " The Monist " and "The Open Court," and Professor 
Dewey of Columbia, formerly of Chicago University, as 
well as other thinkers and scholars here and abroad. 
" Pragmatism," explains a pragmatist, " values ideas by 
their consequences. Those that have no consequences 
it casts out of consideration." Mr. James amplifies 
this as follows : " The only meaning of truth is the 
possibility of verification by experience," and "'Tnie' is 
the term applied to whatever it is practically profitable 
to believe." This doctrine must bring relief to many 
a weary and bewildered reader of mutually contra- 
dictory philosophy books, who, after heavily plodding 
through them all, has merely the consciousness of being, 
like Faust at the end of his studies, " so Hug als wie 
zuvor." ... 

An encourager of summer reading is the liberal 
librarian, or library trustee, whose love of red-tape is 
overborne by a desire to increase the library's useful- 
ness, and to turn wliat is often called "the silly season " 
into a season of edification. The ciurent montlily bul- 
letin of the Carnegie Library, Pittsburg, prints some 
rules that will delight vacation readers. Regular card- 
holders, leaving town for the summer, may take with 
them ten books, four of which may be novels, and the 
whole ten may be kept until the first of October. Books 
not yet a year old, m library ownership, are excepted, 
as are also such other works as it may seem miwise to 
remove from general circidation for so long a time. 
This arrangement is creditable to all concerned, and a 
like liberality is coming more and more to be exercised 
by the public libraries in our other cities.

The author of " Axick-for-siiort," Mr. William 
Frend De Morgan, who is also well-known as the author 
of " Joseph Vance," proves to be the son of no less a 
celebrity than Augustus De Morgan, the mathematician. 
Educated at University College, London, he began to 
study art in 1858, became a student in the Royal 
Academy a year later, practised arts and crafts till 
early in the present century, when he wrote the begin- 
nmg of " Joseph Vance," to see whether he had a turn 
for fiction. He decided in the negative, but his wife 
found the manuscript and persuaded him to finish it. 
The story is not autobiographical, as many have sup- 
posed; and its successor is equally a work of the imagi- 
nation. De Morgan fiction now promises to outrival 
De Morgan pottery — the ware produced at the works 
erected by Mr. De Morgan in the early seventies.

Keen discernment of literary genius has been 
evinced by American readers in the ease of more than 
one English author who later achieved recognition from 
his own countrymen. Under Emerson's lead we did 
much to hasten Carlyle's lagging fame; and this service 



to one of the greatest, if not the very greatest, of Vic- 
torian writers might have gone down in history as 
unequaled in its kind had it not lately been discovered 
that a far more famous name in English literature — 
the most famous, in fact, both in English letters and in 
the literature of all the world — owes its lustre, not 
partly, but solely, to intelligent citizens of our own 
country. A London newspaper man, who had been 
staying at Stratford-on-Avon, is reported to have asked 
his landlady one day: "Who is this Shakespeare I hear 
so much about down here ? Was he a veiy great man ?" 
To this jocular question the landlady made serious 
reply: " Lor', sir, 'e worn't thought nothing on a few 
years ago. It 's the Americans as 'as made 'im wh^t 
'eis." . . . 

A CRUSADE against THE CIGARETTE IN FICTION, 

and also against all indulgence in alcoholic liquors, is 
said to have been started by the Frances E. Willard 
branch of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. 
And more than this: not content with tabooing all 
novels in which hero or heroine smokes cigarettes { why 
not cigars also, and pipes?) or drinks intoxicants, these 
zealous ladies have decided to include in their con- 
demnation every hero and heroine whose language 
savors of profanity. "It is considered quite smart," 
a leading member of this band of reformers is quoted 
as saying, " for the hero to rip out an oath; but to me 
an oath is as bad as a murder." Shades of Dumas and 
Fielding, what a judgment! Will nothing induce these 
kind ladies to use a little discrimination — to make the 
punishment more accuratelj' fit the crime?

Plagiarism the sincerest flattery might serve 
as an appropriate device for the new London publishing 
house of " Collier & Co.," the firm name adopted by 
Mr. Ralph Hall Caine, son of the Manx novelist. The 
name Collier appealed to the young publisher because 
to him it seemed to stand for success in American 
publishing. He opens for business in Tudor Street, 
and begins with three-shilling novels, one of them by 
his father, who just at present is displaying much zeal 
for the shortening of works of fiction — after having, 
with industrious pen, done his best to induce satiety in 
the novel-reading world and thus to create a reaction 
in favor of stories less long-drawn-out than, for example, 
" The Christian " and " The Eternal City."

The English Ambassador's suggestion to col- 
lege women, in his recent commencement address at 
Bryn Mawr, was a good one. He urged the members 
of the graduating class to cultivate a thorough know- 
ledge of and a fine taste in literatiu'e — a field that the 
average male citizen has no time to enter. The habit 
of reading what is not ephemeral was strongly recom- 
mended. Even without this excellent advice to guide 
her course, woman has already, in these latter days, 
shown herself a formidable rival to man in the field 
of polite letters; and she is likely to push him still 
harder in the years to come.

A varying price for novels is sensibly enough ad- 
vocated by " The Publishers' Weekly," which lu-ges that 
the amount paid for a work of fiction shoidd bear some 
relation to its size and presumable excellence — long 
novels commanding higher prices than short, and the 
products of famous pens selling at a larger figure than 
the firstlings of untried beginners. But no commercial 
rating of quality would prove satisfactory to all con- 
cerned, and probably the most that could be effected

would be an adjustment of price to cost of manufacture 
— tliat is, in general, to the number of words in the 
book. Already Mr. Henry Holt has taken a step in this 
direction by fixing the price of Mr. WUIiam De Morgan's 
novel " Alice-for-short " — which in one sense might 
better be named " Alice-for-loug," since it extends to 575 
pages — at SI. 75. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE "SOUTHERN VIEW" EN LITERATDRE. 

(To the Editor of The Diai..) 
I have been a subscriber for and a thorough reader 
of The Dial for many years. As a review within its 
prescribed limits, I do not know one that is better. 
Your staff of critics is of the best. It is rarely — very 
rarely — that any reader can find a line in your columns 
that pricks or jars. 

In your last issue ( Jxme 16), your reviewer of recent 
fiction uses a few words that I think call for explanation. 
They occur in the review of " The Price of Silence," by 
Mrs. M. E. M. Davis. The reviewer says (page sisO) : 
" A document is in existence which seems to indicate 
that the most terrible of all disgraces (from the dis- 
torted Southern point of -s-iew) is hers; in other words, 
that there is a slight infusion of negro blood in her 
veins." The words in parentheses, " from the distorted 
Southern point of view," constitute the side-step — yes, 
siAe-swipe — of the reviewer that was not only inter 
alios but rather suggestive of an ethnic bias that I had 
never conceived as characteristic of The Dial. The 
whole parenthesis is an incongruous mosaic, but the 
word " distorted " is the equivoque I beg to have light 
thrown upon. That word is certainly ambiguous, and 
I doubt not that your reviewer will take pleasure in 
telling your Southern readers what was meant. 

That he may not be in doubt, nor think me sensitive 
above other men, including himself, I will put the door 
ajar for his appearance. The impression made on me 
by those foreign words is that the writer of them does 
not consider " a slight infusion of negro blood " as a 
serious objection to a woman when a man is looking 
around for a wife — one who is to be his companion 
through life, and, maybe, the mother of his children. 
If this inference be imjust, it will not require many 
words to set me right. If just, I do not think that 
anyone will deny that the inference is logical. If the 
" Southern view " is distorted, then your re\-iewer must 
be one of those at the North who do not object to a 
slight infusion of negro blood in a wife. 

It is needless to point out to any well-informed 
person that the " Southern view " your reviewer seems 
to deplore is unanimous and fixed. If, as he maintains, 
that view is " distorted," and his view is the Northern 
view, then the gulf between the North and the South 
will remain wide open. There seems to be (and I say 
" seems " purposely) a strong current of fellowship set- 
ting in between the North and South; but they can 
never be bed-feUows so long as the North shall insist 
that the negro shall occupy the same bed. Should the 
North take the negro on its side, and on the outside, 
there might be a hope for rest and sleep; but there can 
be neither rest nor sleep so long as the North insists 
that the negro shall not only sleep in the tripartite bed, 
but shall lie next to the Southern man, and on the out- 
side — the side away from the North. 

I may have said more than is necessary to my pur- 



pose, which is to request an explanation of this seeming 
fling at the South. I think this is due to your Southern 
readers, to The Dial, and to your reviewer.

Savannah, Georgia, June SO, 1907. 

[We cheerfully give space to Judge Norwood's 
communication, but can hardly open the gates for 
a discussion of the *' ethnic bias " which he suspects 
to be lurking in the background of the review com- 
plained of. The relations of the races in the South 
involve too large a problem to be opened in our 
columns by one small re^dew. The sentence quoted 
by our correspondent says — outlining the plot of 
the book reviewed — that a supposed '' slight infu- 
sion of negfTo blood " in the veins of the heroine is 
regarded as " the most terrible of all disgraces " 
from the Southern point of view, and this view is 
called " distorted." In other words, the view that 
an accident of birth for which an individual is in no 
way responsible could constitute '' the most terrible 
of all disgraces " is one which is held to be not 
normal, or sound, or natural, or whatever is the 
opposite of "distorted" — the word which our 
correspondent asks for light upon. The word 
•' disgrace " would seem to us the equivocal one, if 
any, in the sentence quoted. — Edr. The Dial.] 

THE TROT PUBLIC LIBRARY. 
(To tie Editor of The Dial.) 

Referring to the communications in your issues of 
April 1 (page 214) and May 1 (page 279), in regard to 
" German and American Reading Habits," I would like 
to correct some inaccuracies in the figures printed in 
regard to the Troy Public Library. The cost of the 
building has never been made public; but during my 
stay in Troy, now of nearly two years' duration, the 
most liberal estimate I have ever heard made on the 
cost of the building has never reached half the sum 
stated by your commentator, who also " ventures to 
guess " quite too large figures as to the size of the col- 
lection of books. The library is at present undergoing 
reorganization, and no one knows exactly how many 
volumes it contains, — 40,000 b nearer the mark. 

As to the circulation, the report for 1906, filed in 
the Regents' office, shows a circulation of 84,732 vol- 
umes, not 62,000 as stated. Troy claims 79,000 popu- 
lation since the annexation of Lansingburgh, not 60,651. 

As to the chief point of the communications — a 
comparison of the reading habits of Germans and 
Americans — in justice to Troy let me add that since 
the Public Library has been more freely open to the 
people the circidation has increased rapidly. In 1904, 
32,123 volumes were circulated; in 1905, 68,998; in 
1906, 84,732. The 1906 circulation includes that of 
the Children's Free Circulating Library, which has 
been moved into the building of the Troy Public Library 
and is being run by it as the children's department. 

The reading public of Troy is not limited to the use 
of the Public Library. There is an excellent library at 
the rooms of the Y^oung Women's Association, free to 
all, and two of the bookstores have large collections of 
books which they loan at the rate of five cents a week. 
These collections, largely though not wholly fiction, are 
well patronized. "jj^^ L. DA^^8, Librarian.

A True American Patriot.* 



The words " patriot " and " patriotism " have 
gained a wider meaning in these later days of 
aspiration toward universal peace and fraternal 
service. Charles Russell LoweU, ending his life 
at twenty-nine years in gallant fighting at the 
battle of Cedar Creek, was a patriot in every 
phase of his life and of its high promise. Cir- 
cumstances prevented him from revealing to the 
world the full measure of his patriotism. He 
has been recalled as a distinguished cavalry 
officer in the Civil War ; but the interpretation 
of his character by Dr. Edward W. Emerson, 
and through Lowell's letters, indicate the high 
hopes for yet greater service which he cherished 
from his youth and for which he had fitted him- 
self. Writing to his friend. Gen. Francis C. 
Barlow, about a month before the fatal battle 
at Cedar Creek, Lowell said : " There are better 
things to be done in the Country, Barlow, than 
fighting, and you must save yourseK for them 
too. There are as many campaigns for a fellow 
as there are half years to his life." Lowell's 
life-purpose, from youth, had been " to raise the 
standard of life and thought of the workingmen 
of America." But he was called away, in his 
young manhood, to more urgent service in the 
war ; and while his active plans and work were 
thus ended, his influence survived among his 
associates, many of whom carried out to noble 
ends his ideals for social service and the up- 
lifting of his fellow-men. 

Dr. Emerson has emphasized one special 
trait of Lowell, as a schoolboy, a mechanic, a 
railroad treasurer, and a military leader, — 
" power of concentration on the work of the 
moment." This ability made him a man of 
great value in every service which he undertook, 
and gave surety of his future leadership. In 
testunony of this, his biographer says : " His 
new acquaintances believed that in him they 
had discovered a remarkable man, made for 
just that place. Yet all soon saw the performance 
of the work in hand was but a low power of a 
force dimly seen behind." Such qualities, known 
to his family and friends and now shown to the 
world of readers, might well have inspired his 
poet-uncle to those tender lines in the great 
" Commemoration Ode," — 

•The Life and Letters of Charles Ehssbll Lowell. By 
Edward W. Emerson. With portraits. Boston: Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 



" In these brave ranks I only see the gaps, 
Thinking of dear ones whom the dumb turf wraps, 
Dark to the triumph which they died to gain : 

Fitlier may others greet the living. 

For me the past is unforgiving ; 

I with uncovered head 

Salute the sacred dead. 
Who went, and who return not. — Say not so ! 
' T is not the grapes of Canaan that repay, 
But the high faith that failed not by the way." 

By far the lai'ger part of this volume is given 
to letters from Lowell to his family and inti- 
mate friends ; but these are preceded by a brief 
comprehensive sketch of his life, by Dr. Emer- 
son, which is admirable in its dignity and 
effectiveness. Abundant notes supplement both 
the life-study and the letters ; to these notes are 
confided many of the most intimate revelations 
of the young soldier's personality. In all his 
relations with men, — in the rolling-mills where 
he was studying the manufacture of iron, in his 
responsible position as treasurer of a Western 
railroad, and in the army, — he carefully studied 
human nature and tried to uplift his associates. 
From subordinates he exacted faithful, often 
severe, labor ; but he never asked of them more 
devotion than he himself gave to the same 
cause, always cheerily, and with no false hopes 
of reward, often saying, " Nothing can repay a 
man for what he has done well, — except the 
doing of it." 

When the Civil War was imminent, Lowell 
was just entering upon what promised much 
satisfaction to his courageous nature, for he had 
been called to manage some unprofitable iron- 
works in Maryland. The attack on Massa^ 
chusetts soldiery in Baltimore roused his militant 
spirit ; and although he often expressed regret 
at the war, yet his sense of the duty of the hour 
called him to the army. Here he served as a 
captain in the Sixth United States Cavalry, 
and later was chosen to raise and command, 
as Colonel, the Second Massachusetts Cavalry. 
For a short time he was in McClellan's Penin- 
sular campaign, then was among those guarding 
the Potomac, and finally was in active service 
in the Shenandoah Valley. Dr. Emerson, with 
the aid of reminiscences and letters from Lowell's 
orderlies as well as his superior officers, has 
presented a vivid picture of this valiant soldier, 
almost rash in his bravery, modest in accounts 
of his own part, but emphasizing the courage of 
others, or deploring the injuries to his horses — 
for he had thirteen horses shot under him in as 
many weeks. The final scene in his life, after 
his fii'st wound at Cedar Creek, is told with 
sympathetic skill. Refusing to be taken from 
the field after the return of Sheridan, he was

mounted on his horse for his last charge, and 
gave his orders in whispers, but with no waning 
of spirit or determination. With justice. Gen. 
"Weslev Merritt. his immediate commander, said, 
" A more gallant soldier never buckled sabre." 

Combined with the valor and practical effi- 
ciency of Lowell's nature was a true refinement, 
shown especially through his letters. As a boy, 
he was an excellent scholar ; and he never lost 
his scholarly habits. After the day's work in 
mill or office, he spent his evenings among his 
books, sharing this plea-sure with others who 
were less favored. Writing to his mother from 
Burlington, Iowa, where he was acting as a 
rail^-ay official, he said : " I am contented here 
perfectly : but man does not live by bread alone, 
he must have human sympathy, real or imagined. 
Do I ever read a canto of Spenser, or of Chap- 
man's stout old Odyssey, without thinking fifty 
times how you would relish this or that, and 
fancying your sympathy ? " Again, he asked for 
Bunyan and Pascal, for dictionaries and poems : 
and on the arri\-al of a bundle of books from 
home, he welcome<l Carlyle with joy. saying, " I 
shall have him for my table companion for a 
month."' During the months which he was 
obliged to spend abroad in search of health, he 
kept his courage strong, wrote interesting de- 
scriptions of unusual scenes in Italy, Spain, and 
Algiers, and seemed to enjoy life, in spite of ill- 
health, with a zest and humorous insight which 
suggest Stevenson. 

The letters in this volume are carefully chosen 
to show the varied traits of Lowell at different 
periods of his life, and also to reveal his sym- 
pathetic qualities as son, husband, and friend. 
Yet the more intimate personal sentences are 
omitted, for the editor evidently holds the sane 
opinion that such passages are too sacred for 
publication. One of Lowell's true friend-s was 
Colonel Robert G. Shaw, whose heroic death 
in command of his negro regiment has been 
duly c-ommemorate<l in sculpture opposite the 
State House in Boston. C-olonel Shaw's sister 
Josephine became the wife of Lowell. They 
passed a few weeks of happy life together in 
camp in Virginia, before the soldier was sent into 
action. The letters to his wife, selected for this 
book, are full of cheery and often illuminating 
comments upon scenery and events, with im- 
pressions of his companions, and plans for their 
life of happy usefulness after the war. IVIrs. 
Lowell died two years ago. Throughout her 
long life she interpreted and fulfilled, in large 
measure, the hopes and purposes of her husband 
for the betterment of social conditions in the 



country which he loved and for which he gave 
his life. 

A close bond of friendship existed between 
Colonel Lowell and Mr. Henry Lee Higginson, 
dating from their school-days. Many letters to 
the latter are included, wherein are blended 
humor, earnest inquiries for his friends welfare, 
and philosophic comments upon life, which 
emphasize Mr. Hi^inson's notes of memory 
regarding Lowell's earlier philosophic habits of 
mind. One of the most self-revealing passages 
in these letters of this far-seeing and aspiring 
soldier is the following, written to Mr. Higgin- 
son in September of 1864 : 

" Don't grow rich; if you once beg-in, you will find it 
much more difficult to be a useful citizen. The useful 

j citizen is a mighty unpretending hero. But we are not 
going to have any Country very long unless such hero- 
ism is developed. There ! what a stale sermon I 'm 
preaching; but being a soldier, it does seem to me that 
I should like nothing else so well as being a useful 
citizen. That 's modest, is it not ? — well, trying to be 

I one, I mean." 

j The student of American history and litera^ 
ture may well be grateful for this record, so 

1 directlv'and fuUy told, of a life which is as 

I mspirmg m memory as it was m companionsmp. 
Thronsh the testimony of the friends of Lowell's 
youth and manhood, in school, m active civic 
life, and in the army, the reader recognizes the 
nobility of this " lost leader," and echoes the 
words of one who knew him well : " He was 
upright as a man, pure as a patriot, and emi- 
nently free from the finesse of the politician. 
Young in years, he died too early for his 
country." Axnte Russell Makble. 



The WORLD'S Great Painters.* 

Thirteen years ago, when Dr. Richard Muther, 
Professor in the University of Breslau, offered 
in the German language his " History of Mod- 
I em Painting," it was promptly recognized as the 
most complete and most brilliant treatment the 
subject had ever received. An English trans- 
\ lation in three volumes was published the f ollow- 
i ing year, but has long been out of print, much 
to the regret of art students and readers gener- 
ally. The work has recentiy been revised by 
the author and continued to the end of the 
nineteenth century, and is now published in an

English edition In four volumes, far handsomer 
than the old ones. Besides all the old illustra- 
tions from woodcuts and photographs, each of the 
new volumes contains about a dozen full-page 
plates in color — a fine gallery in themselves. 

At the same time, another work by Dr. 
Muther is offered by an American translator 
and an American publisher, in two volumes, — 
" The History of Painting, from the Fourth to 
the early Nineteenth Century." Although deal- 
ing with the earlier period (ending where the 
other begins), this is the newer book, having 
been wi-itten in 1900 but now translated for the 
first time. Naturally, these works are much 
alike in style and purpose, which the author 
thus explains : 

" These volumes do not constitute a text-book of the 
history of painting. The author has not luidertaken to 
present the biographies of the artists or descriptions of 
their pictures. For the reader who is interested in 
such personal and descriptive records the material will 
be found available in a number of authoritative works. 
The present purpose is rather to explain from the 
psychology (so to speak) of each period its dominant 
style and to interpret the works of art as ' human docu- 
ments.' " 

It is in the work covering the earlier period 
that the application of this purpose — to inter- 
pret the great masters thi-ough a study of the 
times and circimistances imder which they 
arose — is most marked and consistent. For 
example, Savonarola is characterized a.s "the 
speaking-tube of his time, proclaiming with loud 
voice what others had felt in silence." Like- 
wise, his contemporaries among the painters — 
Piero di Cosimo, Botticelli, Filippino Lippi, 
Crivelli, Perugino, Memling, etc. — are part 
and parcel of the great religious reaction that 
swept over Europe. Thus it comes about that 
some painters usually considered secondary 
step into imexijected prominence. Piero della 
Francesca is one of these. " Impressionism," 
first heard of by that name about twenty years 
ago, is traced directly from him. A true fore- 
runner of this modem school of art, it is shown 
that four hundred years ago this painter set 
forth the problem of realism and endeavored 
to show in what manner atmosphere changes 
color impressions. Born in the little town 
of Borgo San Sepolcro in the midst of the 
Umbrian plain, it was natural that he should 
attempt a solution of this problem. While 
artists who labored in densely populated and 
closely built cities were accustomed to observe 
near objects with sharpened vision, Piero, 
standing on the hill of his native town, saw 
only light and space. He saw the sun as it 



brooded over the valley and bathed objects, now 
in the splendor of the morning, now in the 
quivering light of noon, now in the soft twil- 
light. Narrowed by no limit, his eye swept 
over numbei'less hills into infinite space. The 
two problems of space and light became there- 
fore the chief objects of his life. 

Next to Piero deUa Francesca, Mantegna is 
credited with the greatest influence upon the 
artistic activity of the younger generation. He 
was the first to give figures their full plastic 
rotundity ; the earliest to create perspective 
ceiling decorations, to make portrait groups, 
to raise the study of the nude in motion and of 
draperies to a real artistic problem. The Flemish 
painter Hugo van der Goes is made a prominent 
factor in the evolution of the Florentine school ; 
his painting of the altar-piece for the hospital 
of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence is regarded 
as the greatest event in Florentine art annals 
between the years 1460 and 1470. To find 
Piero della Francesca, Mantegna, and Van der 
Goes, singled out as the epoch-makers in the 
very century where Masaccio has so long been 
conceded nearly the whole of the stage, is 
startling to a degree. 

The psychological contrast between the quat- 
trocento and the cinquencento is very happily 
illustrated by reminding the reader of the 
change of type in the Madonna. 

" In place of the umUla, which had been the ideal of 
the age of Savonarola, maesta now appears. If formerly 
Mary's hair was covered by a gloomy matron's veil, 
she is now clad in princely garments. If she had for- 
merly been the devoted handmaiden of the Lord, and 
later in the works of Correggio a woman of the world, 
she has now become a queen of heaven. Neither mel- 
ancholy nor tenderness beams from her eye; but proud 
and distinguished, lofty and unapproachable, she glances 
down from above. An odor di regina pervades her 
being. Tlie complete absence of the motive of the 
nursing Madomia, to which the age of Leonardo had 
imparted a slight tendency toward the sensual, must 
likewise be attributed to these conceptions of dig^nity 
and princely majesty." 

Thus it continued during the time of Leo X., 
when the gods of Olympus had taken complete 
possession of the Christian heaven, even Christ 
himself becoming but a beautiful Olympian. 
So Hellenic a taste did not wish to see its gods 
bleed and suffer. Then came the Council of 
Trent, which found the art of the Renaissance 
objectionable because it did not adequately 
I^ortray the self-sacrificing spirit of the martyrs. 
The art-hating, fanatical, and puritanic spii-it 
thus created at the beginning of the seventeenth 
century dominated what is here called the 
Counter-reformation. As the Renaissance had 



1907.] 



THE DIAL. 



13 



praised the power of the human body to enjoy, 
so the Counter-reformation glorified its power 
to suffer. Pictures of Christ crowned with 
thorns, and of the Mater Dolorosa, from the 
central figure, and the legends of the saints 
were searched for the most shocking deeds of 
blood. Poison, dagger, and cord, drawing, 
strangling, burning, — all such subjects were 
represented. St. Andrew is nailed to the cross, 
St. Simon struck with a club, St. Stephen 
stoned, and St. Erasmus disembowelled. The 
whole technique of the torture-chamber is re- 
vealed, and instruction is given in all the 
accessories of the Inquisition. 

The seventeenth century, however, made a 
noble record by developing a series of mightj' 
portrait-jjainters — Velasquez. Frans Hals, and 
Kembrandt. It was in Holland that the siui of 
a new day arose, the sun which still illumines 
the world. Art no longer shines only upon the 
eyes of Mary and the Hosts of Heaven ; it settles 
upon arid country lulls, streams upon the sea 
waves, is at home in peasants' houses and the 
dark woods, wanders through the streets and 
alleys, makes a temple of every market. Also 
the religious sentiments which stirred Protestant 
Holland had to find appropriate expression ; the 
living essence of Biblical subjects was released 
from a narrow ecclesiastical sphere, and ap- 
proached anew with all the deep German intro- 
spectiveness. These tendencies were all united 
in Rembrandt — perhaps of all masters, since 
the Christian era, the mightiest proclaimer of 
the great Pan ; to him the cosmic powers of light 
and air signified the divinity- that Michael Angelo 
had painted under a beautiful human form. 

In tracing the evolution of modem painting. 
Dr. Muther finds his task more varied and 
complicated, just as modem life itself is more 
complicated and varied than that of any pre- 
vious age. But he employs the same prin- 
ciple — namely, that the art of every period 
appears as its •• mirror and abstract chronicle." 
He does not accede tj the dicttun, repeated so 
often as to become a commonplace, that the 
nineteenth c*entury has " no style," and the 
whole purpose of his four volumes is to show 
that modern art has a distinctive style, and to 
make clear the logic and sequence of its evolu- 
tion. The question is, what new element the 
age brought into the history of art, not what 
it borrowed eclectically from earlier ages. The 
change that has taken place in the fundamental 
conditions of society has called upon art to 
express itself in a form different from that of 
any earlier time . Formerly , the chief supporters 



of art were the two leading powers of Church 
and King. The most noted works of Raphael 
and 3*Iichael Angelo, of Valasquez and Murillo, 
of Rubens and Van Dyck, were executed either 
for the churches or for the reigning princes of 
their country. The patron of modem art is 
the citizen ; the old culture of the clerics and 
aristocrats has been superseded by that of the 
middle classes. Fngland plays the pioneer part 
in this development, with the advantage of 
ha^Tng no old traditions to stand in its way. 
It had no great past. The plebeian paintings 
of Hogarth laid the foundations ; it was the 
quick eye of Hogarth that discovered the new

ing him, with its manifold idiosyncrasies, and 
proudly felt himself the son of a new age, in 
which rigid conventional forms were every- 
where penetrated by the modem ideas of free 
thought, the rights of man, conformity to nature 
in morals and manners. The world which con- 
fronted him he depicted truly as it was, in all 
its beauty and all its ugliness. With him was 
the origin of modem art- 
It was about the middle of the eighteenth 
century when English influences b^an to fer- 
tilize the Continent. The truth and nattiralness 
of English ideas were introduced as models, and 
England became in her whole culture the school- 
mistress of the Continent. The authors — some 
in the field of poetry only, others in the whole 
sphere of intellectual life — were leaders in the 
battle for liberty against fossilized tradition. 
In the province of art, it was ordained that the 
most powerful figure should be bom in the most 
mediasval country in Europe, on Spanish soil. 
Against an art that was more catholic than 
Catholicism, courtly and mystical, there came 
by far the greatest reaction in Francesco Groya. 
Spanish art, which began in a blind piety, be- 
comes in Goya revolutionary, free, modem. 

Goya is, in his whole nature, a modem man, 
a resdess, feverish soul, nervous as a decadent, 
temperamental to his finger-tips. His style in 
portraiture, his art of composition, his whole 
method, speak to our artists to-day in a language 
easily imderstood. One of the most fascinating 
figures of the beginning of the century, his 
pictures, whether they be violent or eccentric, 
tender or hard, gloomy or joyous, nearly always 
move and palpitate with life, and they always 
keep their charm. 

Thus the author proceeds, singling out die 
epoc-h-making personalities in each coimtry and 
at each period, concluding with a survey of 
present-day art. To Americans, it will be of

special interest to read what this brilliant and 
discriminating authority has to say about 
American art. 

" What is striking in all American pictures is their 
eminent technical ability. There is displayed in these 
pictures a strenuous discipline of talent, an effort to 
probe the subject as artistically as possible, a thorough- 
ness seldom equalled even by the ' thoroughness ' of the 
Germans. And technique being the basis of every art, 
the groundwork for the growth of a specially American 
school has been thus created. . . . Yet even those 
Americans who work in their native land betray an 
accent less national than the Danes, for example, or the 
Dutch; and national accent they cannot have, because 
the entire civilization of America, far more than 
that of other countries, is exposed to international 
influences." 

The excellent bibliography and the Index 
of Artists are additional merits of these 
exhaustive, original, and sumptuous volumes.

Science and Humanity.* 



" The Kingdom of Man," by Professor E. Ray 
Lankester, Director of the Natural History 
Department of the British Museum, is not, as its 
title might indicate, an anthropological treatise, 
but rather a group of three very interesting and 
striking essays on scientific subjects, especially 
as related to the needs and interests of humanity. 
The first is the Romanes lecture at Oxford in 
1905, and is a judicious, trenchant, and forceful 
plea that the English universities abandon the 
compvdsory study of Greek and Latin and make 
the study of Nature an integral and. predom- 
inant part of every man's education. "The 
knowledge and control of Nature," says Pro- 
fessor Lankester, "is Man's destiny and his 
greatest need. To enable future leaders of the 
community to comprehend this, to perceive what 
the knowledge and control of Nature are, and 
what are the steps by which they are gained and 
increased, is the duty of a great university. To 
neglect this is to retard the approach of well- 
being and happiness, and to injure humanity." 

The second essay is an outline of the advance 
in science ma<le in the last quarter of a century, 
being the presidential address at the recent 
meeting of the British Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science. With a bold hand, Pro- 
fessor Lankester sketches the salient features 
of scientific discovery in the fields of chemistry 
(especially with reference to new elements and 
radio-activity), in physics, astronomy, geology,

the biological sciences, and in the study of di.sease. 
One finds here a brief but lucid treatment of 
such matters of common interest as radium, the 
Becquerel rays, the canals of Mai-s, the okapi, 
the larval eel, radiobes, De Vries's mutation 
theory, malaria, the " sleeping sickness," etc. 
The author laments the fact that " there is by 
no means a corresponding ' advancement ' of 
Science in that signification of the word which 
implies the increase of the influence of science 
in the life of the community, the increase of the 
support given to it and of the desire to aid in 
its progress, to discover and then to encourage 
and reward those who are specially fitted to 
increase scientific knowledge, and to bring it to 
bear so as to promote the weKare of the com- 
munity." He believes this neglect of Science, 
and the questionable treatment of scientific men 
by administrative departments of the govern- 
ment, is due to the defective non-scientific edu- 
cation of the governing class in England, and 
to the racial dislike among all classes to the 
establishment and support by public fimds of 
posts which can only be filled by men of special 
training and ability, and not by the candidates 
of popular clamor or class pri\'ilege. The organ- 
ization and technical character of scientific work, 
together with the widely prevalent and easily 
accessible forms of manufactured gaiety, are, 
in the author's opinion, the causes of the con- 
siderable falling off of popidar interest in mat- 
tei'S scientific, and the disappearance of the 
formerly numerous class of amateur naturalists. 
The closing essay, on the " Sleeping Sick- 
ness " which is now devastating tropical Africa 
and bids fair to become the third great plague 
of the ra«e, would make a splendid tract for 
the propaganda now at work in this country to 
bring about the establishment of a Department 
of Public Health coordinate with the other 
departments in the Cabinet at Washington. 
" Medicine is organized in this country by its 
practitioners as a fee-paid profession ; but as a 
necessary and invaluable branch of the public 
service it is neglected, misunderstood, and 
rendered to a large extent futUe by inadequate 
funds and consequent lack of capable leatlers. 
The defiant desperate battle civilized man wages 
with Nature must go on ; but man"s suffering 
and loss in the struggle — the delay in his 
idtimate triumph — depend solely on how much 
or how little the great civilized communities 
of the world seek for increased knowledge of 
Nature as the basis of their practical adminis- 
tration and government." If this be true in 
the British Isles, what must be said of our own

A Haxf-Cexturt of Xatiokal 
Gro\>-th.* 



Two years and a half have now passed since the 
publication of the first volume of the notable histor- 
ical series entitled •' The American Nation," and 
a year has gone by since the appearance of those 
volumes which were last reviewed in The Dial. 
In this interval, eight instalments have been added, 
which cover roughly a half-century of our national 
history — from 1819 to 1865. 

In "The Rise of American Nationality," by 
President Babcock. previously reviewed in The 
Dial, the historj- of the United States had been 
brought down to the new problems that presented 
themselves at the close of the second war with 
England. It is with the fuller discussion of these 
new problems that Professor Turner begins liis 
'■ Rise of the New West," which forms the four- 
teenth volume of the series. The first chapters 
treat of the sections, the Eastern, Middle, and 
Southern States, as yet marked off by ec-onomic 
lines rather than by conscious political differences. 
One finds a fresh and penetrating analysis of the 
religious influences which were re-shaping New 
England thought After this the author reviews 
the material conditions of the central coast states, 
which were the most democratic of all the seaboard 
states, but were already under the leadership of 
professional politicians like Van Biu-en. He then 
takes up the old South, with the economic decline 
of the tidewater section, and with the losses sus- 
tained through the migration of the enterprising to 
the "West or to Georgia. He marks the analogy 
between the economic sectionalism developed within 
the individual states and that which later helped to 
isolate the South from the rest of the Union ; and 
stops to comment upon the political ability with 
which the statesmsn of the South developed the 
defense of their interests. 

All this is but preUminarj-, however, to the central 
theme of the volume, which is the development of 
the West — the land of the frontier. Here Professor 
Turner unfolds at greater length the results of the 
research of many years, foreshadowed in the same 
writer's brilliant essays. — describing the lines of 
emigration and colonization ; the distinctive phases

of economic development, such as the sale of the 
public lands, and the banking experiments of the 
western commonwealths ; and the social conditions, 
both in the nearer and the farther West. Through- 
out the book. also, the author keeps clearly before 
the reader the relation of the g^at party leaders to 
each other, and the personal rivahy that grew out 
of the " era of good feeling." The account of the 
elections of 1820 and 1824 is eminently clear, as is 
also the discussion of single topics, such as the 
Monroe Doctrine and the Missouri Compromise. 

The transition from this volume to that of Pro- 
fessor MacDonald on •' Jacksonian Democracy " 
involves some repetition, for in Professor Turner's 
book Jackson appears as having been long in politics, 
while the new volume goes back to his earlier career : 
even Jefferson's notice of Jackson " choking with 
rage " appears again. But soon the narrative reaches 
Jackson's election to the Presidency, from which 
point his administration serves to bind together the 
various movements of the next eight years. The 
personal politics which distinguished Jackson's con- 
trol of affairs, the use of the patronage, the fights 
over internal improvements, public lands, the tariff, 
nullification, and particularly the Bank of the 
United .States. — these, with Jackson's diplomatic 
success, form, of course, the chief subjects of the book. 
There Ls also a very interesting though crowded 
chapter on the life of the States in Jadkson's time, 
as apart from that of the Federal Government. 

In any work on Jackson's period, the most inter- 
esting if not the most essential part is sure to be dje 
author's estimate of Jackson himself, of his motives, 
his personal judgments, — in short, of his place in 
history. The volume before us is fortunately free 
from the prejudice that mars so able a book as 
Sumner's Life of .Jackson. Of Jackson, Professor 
MacDonald tells us that "in a coarse and corrupt 
society, a society whose moral standards were lax 
beyond anj-thing that would be tolerated now, 
Jackson retained a singfular purity of life, thought, 
and speech." The charge that his state papers were 
written for him. Professor MacDonald questions, 
after comparing the rough drafts with the finished 
letters and speeches. On the other hand, "his 
quarrels, which attained political significance, par- 
ticularly the Eaton and Calhoun affairs, were such 
as only a mind at once narrow, vindictive and 
intense could have prosecuted." His second admin- 
istration "shows deterioration in personal ways," 
and " he not seldom posed before the public for 
mere popular effect" Yet he ♦■ retained to the last 
in the main, his extraordinary hold on the popular 
mind." Of unclear thinking, yet with ''the intui- 
tion of woman rather than the rea.son of man," he 
nevertheless " had hold of the right end of the mat- 
ter in every one of the great issues of his adminis- 
tration." Finally, in this volume our attention is 
^ain called to the emergence of the West as a dis- 
tinct and influential factor in national politics, and 
to Jackson as the embodiment of Western ideals. 
The next volume holds a unique place in the 



16

[July 1, 



series, in that the course of the general narrative is 
for the first time interrupted to devote ahnost an 
entire volume to a special topic, Slavery and Abolition. 
The editor of the series has, moreover, reserved this 
topic for his own handling, — a fact which, in view 
of Professor Hart's well-known interest in and 
investigation of this subject, is significant of the 
importance which he attributes to this instalment. 

The first three chapters present a general sketch 
of the social, intellectual, and economic conditions 
of the United States about 1830, and include an 
account of the earlier phases of railroad-building. 
The six chapters which follow deal with slavery, — 
the system, the Southern whites, the free negroes, the 
plantation life, the control, and the sale of slaves. 
In the next seven chapters we find the arguments 
for and against slavery, — first the Southern defense, 
then the various forms of anti-slavery doctrine. From 
this the author proceeds to the question of slave 
revolts, fugitive slaves, the Underground Railway, 
and the relation of the movement to the interest of 
the slaveholdei". With the seventeenth chapter the 
treatment passes to a legal phase. After chapters 
on anti-slavery in the States and in Congress, we 
reach the problems of the interstate and international 
relations of slavery. There is a single chapter upon 
the politics and finance of Van Buren's administra- 
tion, and the book closes with a discussion of the 
results of abolition. 

What may some day be the most valuable infor- 
mation concerning slavery now lies hid in planta- 
tion records, local tax-books, and journals of minor 
courts. Apart from this inaccessible material, the 
sources upon which Professor Hart has drawn are 
numerous and varied. Perhaps the greatest weight is 
laid upon the accounts of travellers (with Olmsted 
facile princeps) of which, in the bibliographical 
appendix, an extensive and valuable list is given. 
While the cumulative effect of such testimony is 
very great, it must be conceded that careful weigh- 
ing is necessary, especially when outsiders describe 
the domestic concerns of another people. Tocque- 
ville, for example, is quoted for his opinion on the 
incompatibility of slavery with democracy. There is 
considerable testimony, however, to the existence of 
such a democracy, and another dictum of Tocque- 
ville, that the Union " is an accident that will last only 
so long as circumstances favor it," would perhaps be 
discounted to some degree by Professor Hart. 

Another gi'oup of sources comprises the pamphlet 
literature that continually increased in bulk, the 
bitter attacks and the multiform defenses that were 
put forth. A third body consists of the slave codes 
of the various States. Professor Hart has studied 
with care the history of the Virginia Convention of 
1829-30, and has noted the erroneous impression 
that a bill to abolish slavery failed by a single vote. 
It would have been interesting to add to this an 
account of the debates in other States, about the 
same time, wherein is revealed the seriousness with 
which the positions of the slaves and of the free 
blacks were then considered. 



To Benjamin Lundy, Professor Hart ascribes 
the credit of being the first abolitionist journalist. 
This may be practically true ; but Elihu Embree's 
establishment, in 1820, at Jonesborough, Tennessee, 
of " The Emancipator," should be noticed, even 
though Embree's work was short-lived. This omis- 
sion is of slight importance, however, in view of the 
discriminating history of the anti-slavery and aboli- 
tion movements, in their various ramifications, which 
follows. The author shows how Garrison jipheld 
the extreme view, urging the eradication not only 
of slavery but of all the laws, discriminations, social 
customs, and practices, which bore against the negro 
race. The refusal of the abolitionists to enter the 
territory of their opponents, as the Quakers entered 
Massachusetts, and their preference for agitation at 
long range, is offset by the refusal of the South to 
tolerate discussion within its borders, — a limitation 
of speech which Professor Hart holds up as one of 
the weakest points in the logical armor of the South, 
however great its practical necessity may have been 
considered. 

On the economic injury of slavery to the owners, 
and to the South as a whole, everyone is to-day 
agreed. On the benefit or injury of it to the negro 
himself, there are still different opinions. There is 
of course no question in Professor Hart's mind, and 
he repeatedly places the slave defense in logical 
difficulty with the assertion that as a race the negro 
could not be at the same time " a brute and a happy 
serf, a criminal and a family friend." There lies 
here apossible/aMacia accidentis ; and, years after- 
ward, the sad paradox comes sometimes so near to 
being the truth as to grieve and worry those who 
have at heart the welfare of the freedman. Regard- 
ing the negro's economic incapacity and the differ- 
ence in wealth between North and South, Professor 
Hart is constrained to admit that " the experience 
of the last forty years has shown that slavery was 
not a complete explanation. The negro could not 
be made as efficient as the intelligent, well rewarded 
and productive labor of the North, simply by set- 
ting him free. The South," he rightly adds, " was 
equally mistaken in insisting that slavery was the 
only thing that made the negro efficient : it was 
clinging to a cast-iron and rigid system which 
America had outgrown." 

With respect to accumulating new facts and 
presenting judgments based on fresh investigation, 
no volume of the series surpasses the " Westward 
Extension " of Professor Garrison, who for many 
years has been identified with the work of the 
collection, publication, and study of the Spanish and 
other archives of Texas. The author's style, how- 
ever, lacks the fascination that has marked the 
writing of some of the volumes ; and it seems to 
us that the political side has been developed to the 
exclusion of social and economic life. The theme 
of the book is Expansion, which links it in a way 
to that of Professor Turner ; while the importance 
of the slavery controversy during the decade 1840- 
1850, which this volume covers, puts it in natural

succession to that of Professor Hart. In his second 
chapter. Professor Gan-ison describes the field for 
expansion, -which consisted of Oregon, California, 
and Texas. In later chapters, the author tells us 
of the adjustment of the Oregon and Maine con- 
troversies, and of the negotiations for an Isthmian 
canal. There are two or three chapters on general 
politics. Beyond this, the work is wholly devoted 
to Texas and to the Mexican War. In the opinion 
of Professor Grarrison, the documentary evidence 
entirely disproves the idea that the colonists of 
Texas went thither to establish slavery in that 
country, or that the Texas revolution was brought 
about priraai-ily by influences working from the 
United States. He presents, also, a strong defence 
of President Tyler in the latter's quarrel with the 
Whigs, rejecting the theory that Tyler was moved 
either by flattery or by personal pique, and holding 
that he was actuated in the main by courage and 
consistency, and that he acted as a " brave and 
determined believer in State rights." 

A third divergence from older views is found in 
the chapter on the rupture with Mexico, where 
Polk's conclusion that the boundarj' of Texas 
extended southward to the Rio Grande is shown to 
have rested not only on the doubtful Texan statute 
of 1836. but also on the treaty which Santa Anna 
had concluded while a prisoner in the hands of the 
Texans. Consequently, Polk himself considered the 
advance of Taylor to the Rio Grande, not as an 
invasion, but as a reannexation. When we add to 
these points Professor Garrison's extended rehabil- 
itation of the Slidell mission to Mexico, his argu- 
ment that her rejection of Slidell put Mexico in the 
wrong, his suggestion that the Wilmot Proviso was 
simply " a manoeuvre for political advantage in a 
family quarrel among the Democrats," and his 
contention that the Compromise of 1850, though it 
did not prevent war, is nevertheless redeemed in 
history by the opportunity it afforded for the trans- 
continental expansion of the American States. — 
when we consider all these propositions, backed by 
the weight of long research, it will be agreed that 
this volume is one of the most original in the series. 

The aftermath of the famous Compromise is 
revealed by Professor Smith, in the volume on 
•' Parties and Slavery." It begins with a discus- 
sion of the finality of this measure, so devotedly 
urged by the old Union-loving leaders North and 
South, and so unreal in the outcome. There foUows 
a very clear analysis of the parties and party leader- 
ship of the fifties, contrasting '• Clay, Webster. 
Adams, and above all others, Calhoun, who had no 
love for office-broking," and the rising generation 
of party leaders, of whom Davis, Toombs, Seward, 
Chase, Lincoln, and Douglas " alike considered the 
filling of oflices with personal and party friends as 
the natural course of events." Besides the develop- 
ment of the spoils system, another feature of the 
new politics of the decade was the appearance of 
corruption, which is connected with the influx of 
foreign immigrants. 



The central feature of the work is the Kansas- 
Nebraska affair. Professor Smith has made a 
careful study of Douglas and the evolution of the 
doctrine of popular sovereignty. The results of 
this doctrine, the organized immigration from New 
England, the Missourian retort of fraud and intim- 
idation, the illegal voting and the extreme pro- 
slavery action of the Shawnee Mission legislature, 
were utterly beyond the imagination of the senators 
and representatives who voted for the bill in 1854. 
The surprise of the Eastern Anti-Nebraska men at 
the action of the Free-State men in Kansas, the 
political situation thus created, and the imminent 
danger of war, explain the necessity which arose 
for some sort of Federal action. The outcome of 
the policy which Buchanan adopted and his mistake 
in risking all on the effort to force in Kansas as 
open to slavery, and the consideration of Douglas's 
victory in Illinois, lead to the final verdict upon 
Buchanan, — that " no president has a record of 
more hopeless ill-success." 

The book closes with what is really a psycho- 
logical study of the •' Northern ferment " and 
" Southern sectionalism " of the time, — titles which 
partisans of that day might have reversed. Before 
these concluding chapters. Professor Smith has 
found space for an excellent discussion of the wider 
social and economic phenomena of the era, — the 
railroad building of the fifties, the enormous land- 
grants of Congress and the lavish stimulation of 
the states, the expansion of agriculture and manu- 
factures, of ship-building, mining, banking, and 
foreign trade, — together with a brief discussion 
of foreign affairs and finance. Separate chapters 
treat of the panic of 1857 and of the Dred Scott 
decision. 

In passing from Professor Smith's book to the 
next in the series, one naturally expects a direct 
continuation of the narrative ; but Admiral Chad- 
wick's volume, with the modest title '• Causes of the 
Civil War," spends the first four chapters in a 
review of the preceding ground, a discussion of 
•'Southern nationalization," a description of the 
slave-holding South, an apology for Douglas, and a 
long indictment of Calhoun. In view of the various 
prefaces and summaries of both the authors and the 
editor, so liberally distributed through the former 
volumes, this seems rather supererogatorj', and the 
account is hardly so impartial as the general tone 
of the series would demand. The fifth chapter tells 
the story of the raid of John Brown, with fuU reali- 
zation of Brown's enthusiasm, and with condemna- 
tion both for the misdirection of this enthusiasm 
and for the g^Ut of the men of saner mind who 
lent their aid to the plan. With regard to the elec- 
tion of 1860, the author stresses the large Southern 
vote opposed to Breckinridge and Lane, and con- 
siders the decision to secede as forced upon the 
people by their leaders. The next phase is an 
extensive survey of Buchanan's last months, with 
the futile attempts at compromise. 

After a careful discussion of the establishment of 



IS

the Confederate government at Montgomery, and 
of the Constitution of tlie Confederate States, Ad- 
miral Chadwick turns to the second attempt at com- 
promise, known as the Peace Conference, noting the 
disappointment of the country at large, and espe- 
cially the border states, at the resolute and unyield- 
ing spirit of the leaders in Congress. The rest of 
the book constitutes a detailed study of the rein- 
forcement of Sumter, the attitude of President 
Lincoln, and the negotiations concerning the evac- 
uation of the fort. The strictures of Southern sym- 
pathizers upon the candor of the administration are 
met with the statement that Seward, in his assurance 
that the fort would he evacuated, acted without the 
knowledge or consent of President Lincoln. The 
last chapter tells of the bombardment. 

From the weary tale of preliminaries it is a relief 
to tui-n to the narrative of action. In the two vol- 
umes entitled " The Appeal to Arms " and " The 
Outcome of the Civil War," which Dr. Hosmer con- 
tributes to the series, we have a model of what 
historical writing ought to be. Of the technical 
accuracy of military history, it is rash for a layman 
to judge ; but those who, on particular points, may 
differ from Dr. Hosmer must admit that his opinions 
are expressed not only with caution but with the 
utmost freedom from bias. While the greater part 
of these volumes deals with fighting, Dr. Hosmer 
has studied with care the material bases necessary 
to support the war. The service of the Engineer 
corps, the development of the Sanitary Commission, 
and Stanton's energetic control of details, receive 
due appreciation ; while finance and general politics 
are not neglected. Dr. Hosmer writes with some 
detail of the suffering in the South. In one point 
his opinion seems to us at fault : in describing the 
Southern indignation at Butler's New Orleans order 
concerning the treatment of women, he says that 
" the usual treatment of such persons was confine- 
ment in the calaboose or lockup, and neither Butler 
nor his soldiers had any other intention." It was 
hardly the actual punishment that was resented. 
Another topic perhaps insufficiently handled is the 
influence of immigration in swelling the numbers of 
the Northern armies. 

But as we suggested of the Jacksonian era, so 
in the case of the Civil War, we are perhaps most 
interested in estimates of disputed matters, — such, 
for example, as the failure of McClellan, Lee's rela- 
tion to Longstreet and to Stonewall Jackson, or 
the question of the burning of Columbia. On these 
moot points, and on such others as the prison con- 
troversy. Professor Hosmer gives both sides, and 
presents his own opinion with dignity. Finally, in 
no way does the author's ability to rise to the tragic 
power of his great subject appear more brilliantly 
manifest than in the characterizations which he has 
given us of the leaders of the War, of Grant, of 
Chase, and of a score of others, — above all, of the two 
heroic figui'es, Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee. 

The publication of these volumes in the order of 
their chronology conduces to the advantage of the 



series. The writers of all the later volumes have 
had ample time for the preparation and construction 
of their work, which shows almost none of the evi- 
dences of haste that marred some of the earlier 
volumes. The typography continues to be most 
satisfactory, though a strange exception is found 
where, in his own book, pater potestas escapes the 
editor's eye. As the series progresses, and the 
periods assigned to the several volumes are made 
shorter, each author has greater opportunity for 
detail, till in the last of the volumes just reviewed 
only two or three years are covered. Thus all the 
defects and merits of the cooperative system are 
exaggerated ; on the one hand, each period is han- 
dled by one supposed to be an expert ; on the other, 
there are many repetitions that would be avoided in 
the work of a single hand, and that seemingly defy 
the linking process undertaken by the editor. It is 
indeed questionable whether the series as a whole 
is not too large for the general reader, to whose 
interests it is professedly devoted. The eight vol- 
umes of which we have endeavored to give this 
outline contain over twenty-four hundred pages of 
reading matter, excluding prefaces, bibliographical 
matter, indexes, tables of contents, and maps.

"Making a Newspaper" (Holt) can hardly be 
worth the telling ; or at least the reader of his fuU 
and interesting and seemingly trustworthy account 
of all branches of his profession may well be left 
with that impression. In eighteen chapters, each 
packed with practical details, the story of the gi'eat 
American newspaper, as it now exists, is gi-aphically 
told. Noteworthy and unexpected is this experi- 
enced journalist's admission, in his chapter on 
" Preparing for Journalism," that " the elements of 
newspaper work might be taught [in a school] as 
successfully as are the elements of law, medicine, 
or anything else," although as yet, he declares, 
" there is in existence no well-equipped school 
which teaches journalism." Mr. Given's tendency 
to regard " yellow " journalism rather as a huge 
joke than as anything more serious or deplorable, 
and as even not without its merits, is open to criti- 
cism. While the editors of these sensational sheets 
do not, as he admits, " like everything about yellow 
journalism, . . . their contention is that they go to 
extremes to attract readers, but that in doing this 
they gain wide followings, and are thus enabled to 
right wrongs, protect the weak, and strive with effect 
for the public good. That the yellow journals really 
do some of these things cannot be denied." But 
that nevertheless their influence is on the whole bad, 
many thoughtful observers must still believe. As

to the disputed origin of the term "yellow journal- 
ism." Mr. Given's explanation (the common one) 
is that this tj-pe of newspaper '• got its name in 1897 
when the leading exponent of the school was exploitr 
ing with much ostentation a series of colored 
pictures in which the foremost character wore a 
yellow dress." As a matter of fact, the Yellow Kid 
was cutting his capers as early as 1896 ; but this 
may not conflict with the foregoing statonent. 

Mr. Philander Deming, one of the 
lawtemoir^pKer pioneers of court stenography in this 
andttory-friter. country, and also the author of some 
good short stories of American ante-bellum life and 
manners — stories that have appeared in the pages 
of " The Atlantic " — now gathers up some loose 
threads of autobiography and romance in a small 
volume entitled "The Story of a Pathfinder" 
(Houghton. Mifflin & Co), the six chapters or 
sections of which are chiefly reprints from the 
above-named and other periodicals. Opening with 
an account of his rise to the dignity and emoluments 
of a court stenographer, Mr. Deming goes on to 
relate how he wrote his first successful story, then 
gfives a few tastes of his qualitj- as a narrator of 
fiction, and concludes with another bit of autobio- 
graphic reminiscence- His style, easy and conver- 
natinnal, is attractive ; and the plots of his tales, 
which have the touch of real life, are ingenious 
without being involved, and all end with a finely- 
conceived and unexpected stroke that pleasingly caps 
the already well-developed climax. His account of 
how he sent forth that first manuscript that stayed 
where it was sent will strike a responsive chord in 
many a breast. Even more subtly soul-stirring is 
his attempt to describe, from his own experience, 
the consecration and the poet's dream. ** The gentle 
breeie," he says, writing of himself in the third 
person, " the soft gusurrug of the flowing stream, 
and the shining of the sun, became to him very 
beautiful, and he was suddenly conscious of a h^ipi- 
ness beyond these, and of which he could not speak 
and which he did not in the least know about or 
■ understand. It was nothing ; it was formless as 
the viewless air. And yet it made his whole life 
broader and brighter. . . . And as time has gone 
by, at intervals of years this visitation has come 
again and again, and it has been the same sQent 
joy under all kinds of outward experience and 
circumstances."

the inuiieetual that of Professor Mitchell of the 
tupert* of life. University of Adelaide, to which he 
gives the title " Structure and Growth of the Mind " 
(Macmillan). the reviewer feels keenly the unfor- 
tunate limitations that stand in the way of his pre- 
senting in a manner to interest the general reader 
a work at once technical, comprehensive, and dis- 
tinctive. To set forth the psychologist's vista of the 
intellectual world ; to give the impress of his interest* 
and temperament -. to elucidate his problems and his 
methods of approach, — to do all this wisely and well 



requires an unusual talent, especially if we add to 
the requirements that of maintaining an appeal to 
the interested and arable student or reader. Pro- 
fessor Mitchell's '"-""■l of five hundred pages suc- 
ceeds in all these respects. It is, however, frankly 
technical : it is a book to be studied, not to be read. 
It has the discursive form of lectures, yet, after all, 
of written lectures that reflect the slow and careful 
growth of his phrasing and presentation, and assume 
a like attentive and painstaking attitude on the part 
of the student in the class-room or the study. The 
problem is the large and general one of the source, 
nature, and warrant of the intellectual aspects of 
life ; of the kingdom of knowledge, yet not of 
knowledge alone, but of experience, suffused with 
emotion, interwoven with values, guided by ideals. 
It is, in brief, the very heart of the psychological 
territory which is here described and interpreted by 
a master naturalist of the mental domain. A vol- 
ume of this type does not lend itself readily to 
synopsis or comment, except to the circle of those 
specifically minded to follow the pursuit. To gneh 
the work is enthusiastically recommended as a notable 
addition to the modem literature of psychology.

industry, ingenuity, and wise choice, the compiler 

has made historic Concord tell its own story, as 

one might say, with very little editorial interference. 

The authors quoted include, of course, Emerson

with Concord, but sure of a hearing in their hdp- 

ful contributions to the book. Forty-nine excellent

text, and two maps aid one in finding the way

Grapevine Cottage, with old Ephraim Wales Bull,

Excellent is the biographical feature of the book: 

it serves as a handy biographical dictionary of 

Concord worthies. The only thing to criticize 

(mildly) is the editor's or printer's practice of using, 

throughout, quotation marks only at the beginning 

and end of the paragraphed excerpts, thus allowing 

manv quoted passages to assume the appearance 

of original matter. A little puzzling, too, is the book's 

appiarent beginning with chapter three, a brief 

railway guide and a map counting as the first two 

chapters or sections. It hardly need be added that 

this " Story of Concord " is good for stay-at-home 

travel, as well as for tourist use.

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



The ttorv of There is no better test of the roman- 
tnEiiaiilT'' t'" element in English literature than 
poetry. the stoiy of King Arthur. Wherever 
there is any interest in romance, there is pretty sure 
to be a corresponding interest in Arthur and his 
knights of the Round Table. There is no group of 
stories in the middle ages that has exercised upon 
English literature a fascination comparable to this 
one, none that has combined so much of the poetic 
and the picturesque for the use of subsequent poets. 
It was therefore a particularly happy idea that 
prompted Dr. Maynadier to present, in " The Arthur 
of the English Poets " (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.), 
the story of Arthur from the earliest times to Ten- 
nyson, and thereby to note the fluctuations of the 
romantic throughout our literature. Beginning with 
the historical Arthur, of whose existence there does 
not seem to be much doubt, Dr. Maynadier traces 
the growth and the various developments of the 
story in the middle ages. He shows how the several 
elements of the legend — Merlin, Lancelot, the holy 
grail, and Tristram — came together and were given 
their finest mediaeval expression in a complete form 
in Malory's " Morte D' Arthur." Then follows 
Spenser, the last of the medisevals and the first of 
the moderns, after whom there is comparative silence, 
especially during the unromantic stretches of the 
classical period, tiU the nineteenth century, when 
the early and the late romanticists found embodied 
in it all the enchantment of the middle ages, the 
strangeness added to beauty of which Pater speaks. 
It remained for Tennyson to give the story its most 
artistic expression. Dr. Maynadier's treatment of 
his subject is most scholarly and sympathetic, and 
nowhere is it more so than in his discussion of 
Tennyson's presentation in modern form of this old- 
world legend. 

Interest in the history, geography, 
legends, and literatm-e of the Emer- 
ald Isle has never been stronger than 
now, and it is increasing. No true son of Erin will 
lightly put aside Mr. Stephen Gwynn's attractive 
and scholarly volume entitled " The Fair HUls of 
Ireland" (MacmUlan), which is designed as a 
topographical, historical, and legendary g^ide for 
the desultory rambler (or reader) imbued with a 
love for the scenic beauties and the storied antiqui- 
ties of the island over which good Saint Patrick 
extends his protection. The book, says Mr. Gwynn, 
" has been written for the traveller rather than for 
the tourist, for Irishmen rather than for strangers ; 
but in general for all who will sympathise with the 
project which sent two of us out on a pilgrimage of 
pleasure undertaken in pursuit of knowledge. Our 
object was to represent by typical instances Ireland 
as a whole ; and so to a number of places and dis- 
tricts up and down the country we went looking for 
what would help to realise, for ourselves and for 
others, Ireland as she is, and as she has been." The 
" two of us " are the author, and the artist, Mr. 
Hugh Thomson. In the matter of history, the very 



Ireland as

has been. 



early period is especially illustrated, when Ireland, 
in spite of the Danish invaders, was still Ireland of 
the Gael, not Ireland of the Gael and the Gaul. 
Descriptions of ancient monuments and passages 
from early documents are given. The thirty-five 
illustrations are sketchy and suggestive rather than 
finished pictures. That the art of illustrating in 
color is stni in its crude infancy, again makes itself 
evident. A glossary of native terms would have 
been a convenience to the reader, as also a map with 
the places referred to marked. 

A boon to the Once in a while it is one's fortune to 
health-seeker come across an unpretentious book or 
tnthe nest. booklet which is thoroughly satisfy- 

ing from cover to cover. Such an one is " Gaining 
Health in the West" (B. W. Huebsch, New York). 
The author, Mr. Geo. B. Price, nine years ago went 
to Colorado Springs in quest of relief from lung 
trouble. He has studied conditions in Colorado, 
New Mexico, and Arizona, and his book is packed 
with information and sound advice for those who 
contemplate migrating west for the purpose of com- 
bating the white plague. Such practical topics as 
where and how to live, getting employment, avoid- 
ing loneliness, and finding suitable comradeship, are 
treated with eminent sanity and straightforwardness. 
Social and ethical questions are handled with a sure 
and accurate touch. The nature of the disease is 
discussed in the light of the latest research, and 
good advice is given as to things that are to be 
done as well as those to be avoided by the health- 
seeker. Anyone contemplating a Colorado resi- 
dence, especially if in search of health, will find this 
little volume an admirable substitute for such advice 
as he might expect from an experienced, sensible, 
and sympathetic friend. 

The record of " ^he Shameless Diary of an Ex- 
an tmsuccessfui plorer " is rightly named by its 
mountain climb, author, Mr. Robert Dunn. He was 
one of a party that sti'ove to reach the summit of 
Mount McKinley, crowned with everlasting snow 
and ice in the sub-arctic solitudes of Alaska. Day 
by day he kept a diary of the movements and adven- 
tures of the party, noting the smallest details. After 
the unsuccessful attempt had ended, and those con- 
cerned in it had returned to civilization, the idea of 
publishing the diary occurred to its author, and he 
determined to lay before the public an unvarnished 
tale. The author might advantageously have omitted 
some of the profanity and coarseness which he has 
retained, but apart from this blemish the book is a 
vivid account of exploring in the strange wilds of 
the remote Northwest. The reader may learn much 
about the natm-e of the country, and will be likely 
to imbibe the notion that he never will desire to 
explore that part of the world, especially if he has 
to go in the company of the particular men of whom 
he has read in this book. A number of half-tone 
reproductions from photograplis form an attractive 
feature of the volume. (Outing Publisliing Co.)

eight men who have won naval victories for America, 
from Jerry O'Brien, who was rather an amateur in 
naval affairs at the breaking out of the Revolutionary

were privateers in the days before we had a navy. 
Of the later period, the Civil War contributes three 
to the list, and the war with Spain two. Altogether, 
the twenty-eight biographies fail to show anj-thing

naval officers whose heroism has been devoted to the

" Phrases and Names : Their Origins and Mean-

the work is an excellent one, but it does not go nearly 
far enough, and the one who consults it will be rather 
more Ukely tlian not to fail to find the particular name 
or phrase wliich has excited his curiosity. Mr. Trench

membership of one hundred has been secured, and that 
the organization is ready for active work. Further

For the benefit of the layman, we may explain that 
Mendelism is a theory of heredity propounded half a

attention, and now made the starting-point of much fresh 
research along the lines marked out by this pioneer. 

Dr. David Starr Jordan's occasional addresses are

TITLES IN TRANSLATION. 

The fabled Frenchman who hit upon " La 
Demiere Chemise de 1' Amour " as a translation 
of " Love's Last Shift." has afforded the light- 
hearted much amusement. By way of turning 
the tables, the whimsical author of " Alice-for- 
Short " suggests •• Miserj' Nosegay " as a suit- 
able version of " Bouc-emissaire," thereby 
making what is probably the worst international 
pun on record. But jesting aside, the problem 
of translating a foreign title is often a seriou.s 
one ; for between book and title there is always 
in the author's mind something of a subtle 
harmony that is likely to be rudely jarred by 
the hand of the foreigner. What shall be 
done, for example, with such titles as " Les 
Miserables," •' Piccolo Mondo Antico," and 
•• Det Flager i Byen og paa Havnen " ? Well, 
we know what has been done. The first is 
reproduced in the original form as clearly 
untranslatable ; the second is frankly aban- 
doned with substitution of •• The Patriot," and 
the third is clumsily given as " Flags Are 
Flying in City and Harbor," which misses the 
idiomatic force of '• det flager." just as " the 
rain is falling " woidd miss the terse brevity of 
•• it rains." 

Happy is the translator who has only a proper 
name to deal with, for this he can reproduce 
with an easy conscience, although not without 
qualms as to the fashion in which his readers 
wUl pronounce it. We remeraljer Balzac's 
frantic search for the proper name he needed 
as a title for one of his stories, and his rap- 
turous delight when he at last discovered it — 
Z. Marcas — over a shop- window. But even as 
felicitous a name as that can hardly be expected 
to have for the English reader much of the 
significance that it had for its French discoverer. 
" Jom LTil " is exactly the name for Pastor 
Frenssen's marvellous novel, but for the reader 
of the English translation almost any other 
German-sounding name woidd do equally well. 
And we doubt not that for a Russian, Anna 
Karenina, for a Spaniard, Maximina, and for a 
Dane, Niels Lyhne, are respectively names that 
have esoteric associations not revealed to us, 
just as we are sure that no Frenchman or 



28 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



German can share our own keen satisfaction in 
such names as Martin Chuzzlewit and Enoch 
Arden. 

Sometimes the title given to an English trans- 
lation is a wanton metamorphosis of the original ; 
at others it is simply perverse, made so through 
ignorance of the exact force of certain words. 
Mary Howitt, who made the first English trans- 
lation from Herr Bjbrnson, balked at the name 
"^Synnove Solbakken," and called the book 
"Trust and Trial." Conversely, Miinch- 
BeUinghausen's " Der Sohn des Wilderness " 
is known to us only by the name of Ingomar, 
its barbarian hero. These are illustrations of 
the former case ; of the latter, an example in 
point is provided by Ibsen's " Et Dukkehjem." 
This title, which should be translated " A Doll 
Home," has vmfortimately become perverted 
into the colorless phrase, " The Doll's House," 
and custom has so fixed this form upon the 
English mind that it is now almost useless to 
protest against the mistranslation. 

The older and more classical works of Euro- 
pean literature have fared tolerably well in this 
matter of title-translation, mainly because their 
titles have offered no great difficulties. Dante, 
Cervantes, Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Moliere, 
Rousseau, Manzoni — these have no cause to 
complain. Moliere's " Le Boiu-geois Gentil- 
homme " has made trouble, and it is, of course, 
one of those titles which cannot be translated ; 
Goethe's " Wahlverwandtschaften " might have 
made trouble, had not its translator hit upon 
" Elective Affinities" as a happy equivalent. 
The idiomatic title presents a serious problem, 
and lucky indeed is the translator who finds in 
his ovra language a corresponding idiom of 
similar brevity. Freytag's " Soil und Haben " 
is a typical illustration of this case, for as 
"Debit and Credit" it retains in English its 
exact original meaning. " Dame Care " for 
Herr Sudennann's "Fi-au Sorge " and "Ground 
Arms ! " for Fran von Suttner's " Die Waff en 
Niederl" also offer illustrations of felicitous 
idiom in translation. Another of Herr Suder- 
mann's books, grimly entitled " Es War,"' con- 
fronts the translator with a delicate question. 
Does it mean, " the past is over and done," or 
does it mean, " we are responsible for the past 
and cannot escape the consequences of oiu* 
deeds" ? Our recent version of the book calls 
it " The Undying Past," deciding for the latter 
interpretation ; but we are inclined to thmk 
that the former was the one the author meant 
to emphazise. 

The tendency of modern novelists and play- 



wrights to invent far-fetched or enigmatic titles 
makes the question of translation more compli- 
cated than it used to be. Particidarly in the 
case of a play the title has so large a share in 
determining its fortunes with the public that 
the selection of an alluring device becomes a 
matter of great consequence. Hence it is the 
rule rather than the exception that plays of 
foreign origin are served up to us with new 
English names. " Les Pattes de Mouche " 
becomes " A Scrap of Paper," and " Der Raub 
der Sabinerinnen " becomes " A Night Off." 
Novels seem to have less need than plays of 
this sort of masqueratle, perhaps because they 
are purchased, for the most part, on the score 
of their authors' reputation. A species of title 
peculiarly puzzling to the translator is that 
which is taken from some popular proverb, or 
consists of a literary tag. Biblical titles offer 
less difficulties than others of this kind, because 
they have familiar equivalents in most lan- 
guages, but such a title as " Problematische 
Naturen " requires, for all except Goetheans, 
a note to explain it. This practice of finding 
titles in familiai' quotations is, however, far 
more common with English than with foreign 
writers, in consequence whereof the problem is 
more theirs than ours. 

Foreigners, in fact, pi-obably have greater 
troubles than we do in finding suitable names 
for translated books. Sometimes they make diffi- 
ciUties where such do not exist. Mr. Sinclair's 
" The Jungle " might have been published in 
French as " Le Fouri-e,'' but its actual appear- 
ance was made as " Les Empoisonneurs de 
Chicago." The difficulty goes all the way back 
to Shakespeare. In the German text, we may 
easily enough recognize an old acquaintance in 
" Ende Gut, Alles Gut," but we are apt to 
puzzle, for a moment at least, over " Der 
AViderspJinstigen Zalimung. ' And we take 
special delight in picturing to ourselves the 
foreigner racking his brain to convert into 
French or German such a title as Browning's 
" Red Cotton Nightcap Country ; or. Turf and 
Towers." He would have to go back to 
Rabelais, or Abraham a Sancta Clara, to find 
anything comparably fantastic in the book- 
nomenclature of his own literature. To cap the 
examples contained in this article with a final 
word of counsel, we wish to emphasize the obliga- 
tion resting upon every translator who modifies 
the title of his original, to print that original 
also upon his title-page. No translation has 
the right to masquerade in an impenetrable 
disguise.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A Yankee at the cocbt of Kixg Edward — not 
a Yankee in the strictest sense, but the term will serve 
— has of late been attracting the general gaze. His 
appearance, too, at Oxford, in academic robe, to receive 
his doctorate, must have been a memorable spectacle. 
Even to the imagination of the absentee it is a rare 
treat to picture Mark Twain a» thus solenmlv apostro- 
phized by Lord Curzon: " Vir jocundissime, lepidissime, 
facetissime, qui totius orbis terrarum latera nativa tna 
hilaritate coneutis, ego, anctoritate mea et totius uni- 
versitatis, admitto te ad gradum doctoris in litteris 
honoris cajisa." But why, it may be asked, has staid 
old Oxford thus honored our great humorist ? Is it for 
his " native hilarity," or for some deeper, more humanly 
appealing, more lasting quality ? Possibly the answer 
may be found in a few sentences, tremulous with feel- 
ing, that followed the fimny part of his address to the 
Pilgrims' Club in London. After holding a number of 
persons and things British up to good-natured laughter, 
the humorist suddenly turned grave and touched in a 
heart-stirring manner on the ties binding him to En- 
glaud, on the sadness that had entered his life in the 
death of a beloved daughter in mid-ocean seven years 
ago, and on the duty he felt to be his, knowing sorrow 
as he did by personal experience, to benefit humanity 
with all the cheerfulness of thought and speech at his 
command. It must be for his great heart, for his sym- 
pathy with the imder side — which will be remembered 
as another great humorist's definition of humor — that 
Mark Twain has been admitted to the " grade of doctor 
in letters." ... 

A TWICE-TOLD AUT0BI06RAPHT, as it appears, is that 
of Miss Ellen Terry, which began with great promise in 
the June " McClure's Magazine," was continued in the 
July number, and now is abruptly discontinued. The 
McClure editors chanced upon the disconcerting dis- 
covery that considerable portions of what they were 
publishing had already appeared, either in substance 
or verbatim, in " The New Review " sixteen years ago, 
under the title " Stray Memories." This unfortunate 
plagiarism of oneself is charitably, and plausibly, 
charged to the amanuensis who prepared the manu- 
script for market; and as no payment has yet been 
made for the "dead wood,' as the McClure editors 
style it, there is not likely to be any impleasantness 
over the matter, unless Miss Terry's agent, disap- 
pointed of his commission on a handsome purchase- 
price of the autobiography, should take legal action. 
On the whole, the discontinuance is to be regretted, 
since the probability is that the narrative would soon 
have worked itself free of stale matter and offered 
nothing but fresh and highly interesting reminiscences 
of the popular actress. The " Xew Review " chapters 
were short, confined to three numbers of that magazine, 
and gave very little of the narrator's life after 1878. 
For the twenty-nine subsequent years she must have 
much to relate that is well worth reading, to say nothing 
of the fact that even for the earlier years her discon- 
tinued memoirs were more detailed than those pub- 
lished in 1891. . , . 

A FTmNG Longfellow memorial takes the form of 
a fellowship in literature at Bowdoin College, the poet's 
alma mater. His three daughters, Miss Longfellow, 
Mrs. Dana, and Mrs. Thorpe, have given ten thousand 
dollars to the college as an endowment, the income from 



which will be paid each year to some promising grad- 
uate for purposes of study abroad, or at some university 
at home, in languages and literature. Among the late 
commencement exercises at Bowdoin was a Longfellow 
address by Professor Henry Leland Chapman, who 
occupies the chair of English literature at that college. 
He spoke in the historic First Congregational Church, 
where Longfellow delivered his '* Morituri Salutamus " 
<m the fiftieth anniversary of his graduation. The 
speaker foimd the explanation of Longfellow's unique 
appeal " partly in the essential nature of his art," and 
added that " the truest art is that which reflects the 
simplicity of nature and lays upon the human spirit a 
spell not unlike that which is wrought in a thousand 
familiar ways by nature herself." He quoted aptly 
frran Sidney's " Apologie for Poetrie," which makes 
the poet monarch of all sciences. " He cometh to you 
with words set in delightful proportion; and with a tale 
forsooth he cometl^ to yon; with a tale which holdeth 
children from play, and old men from the chimney 
coiner; and, pretending nothing more, doth intend the 
winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue." Not 
in Brunswick, Maine, alone, but far beyond will satis- 
faction be felt at the honor filially paid to Longfellow, 
poet of " old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good," as 
Ixaak Walton might call him, were that amiable angler 
now alive. ... 

Expecting the impossible of school-children is 
not good pedagogy, to say the least. The prescribing 
of literary exercises that would set even a well-fnmished 
adnlt head to aching is folly. New York boys and 
^Is, if <Mie may believe a New York journal not given 
to the printing of untruths, are required by their teachers 
to write essays and prepare debates on such topics as 
"The influence of the United States on the World's 
Diplomacy," "Resolved, That any infringement upon 
the dual interpretation of the Constitution should be 
regarded as a menace to the stability of democratic 
institutions," " Trade in the East during the Fifteenth 
Century," and " The Economic Development of the 
L'nited States from the Civil War to the Present Time." 
The public librarian is expected to smooth the path for 
the young feet so that the twelve-yeaiM)ld essayist and 
the fourteen-year-old debater shall acquit themselves 
creditably on the day of doom. But what can the best 
of librarians do except furnish such books as are least 
hopelessly beyond the comprehension of the youthful 
mind, and then wink at the wholesale copying of the 
little-understood contents ? It is all simply a lesson 
in plagiarism to those who are too young to know that 
plagiarism is wrong. Far wiser on the teacher's part, 
and just as useful (or useless) to the pupil, would it be 
to prescribe a task in copying so and so many pages of 
Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations " or De Tocqueville's 
" Democracy in America." The same end would at least 
be honestly reached, and by a less eiicuitoos course. 
... 

Introducing Shakespeare into England is what, 
if one may credit Mr. Arthur Symons, has recently been 
effectively done by Mr. Sothem and !Miss Marlowe, " the 
Englishman and the Englishwoman who have come to us 
from America, in the guise of Americans." How it is 
that our cousins across the ocean " get from the acting 
and management of these two actors a result which no 
one in Ijigland has ever been able to get," is thus 
explained by Mr. Symons: " Well, in the first place . . . 
they have the odd caprice of preferring Shakespeare to 



30 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



themselves; the odd conviction that fidelity to Shake- 
speare will give them the best chance of doing great 
things themselves. . . . There is no actor on our stage 
who can speak either English or verse as these two 
Americans can. It is on this preliminary technic, tliis 
power of using speech as one uses tlie notes of a musical 
instrument, that all possibility of great actmg depends." 
After praising Mr. Sotheru's rendering of Hamlet's 
soliloquy, the friendly critic continues: " Every solilotjuy 
of Shakespeare is meant to be overheard, and just so 
casually. To render this on the stage requires, first, an 
understanding of what poetry is ; next, a perfect capacity 
of producing by the soimd and intonation of the voice 
the exact meaning of those words and cadences. Who 
is there on our stage who has completely mastered those 
two first requirements of acting ? No one, now aeting 
in English, except Julia Marlowe and Edward Sothern." 
He further affirms, still referring to their acting: " We 
have nothing like it in England, nothing on the same 
level, no such honesty and capacity of art, no such 
worthy residts." It is pleasant to note this hearty rec- 
ognition, but one could have wished tliat it had been 
more generally shared by the London public, and that 
Mr. Sothern and Miss Marlowe had met with greater 
pecuniary siiccess than appears to have attended their 
venture. . , . 

A SKY-SCRAPING MONUMENT TO THE PlLORIM 

Fathers will have its comer-stone laid next month by 
President Roosevelt at the Cape Cod town of — Ply- 
mouth, the uninformed would naturally conclude; but 
it is not Plymouth. Provincetown, the fist at the end 
of the bent arm that defends the Massachusetts coast 
and presents hostile elbow and aggressive knuckles to 
the outside world, strenuously claims the honor of hav- 
ing first received on its shifting sands the imprint of 
a puritanic foot, at least twenty-four hours before the 
famous landing at Plymouth. How upsetting is all this 
to fondly cherished tradition ! The " holy gromid, the 
soil where first they trod " now ceases to be that jeal- 
ously guarded bit of Plymouth granite on which so 
many sight-seers have gazed with swelling bosoms. 
The " stem and rockbound coast," against which the 
breaking waves dashed high, must no longer call up a 
picture of the cranberry marshes around Duxbury Bay, 
but rather the gently sloping beach of Barnstable 
County. How liigh tliis interesting memorial at Prov- 
incetown is to rear its head cannot here be exactly 
stated, but the confident hope of the " Tip-Enders " is 
that it will attain an altitude sufficiently lofty to look 
down on the humbled pride of Plymouth. At any rate, 
its erection is to start imder highly favorable auspices 
— a speech from the most illustrious representative of 
the Dutch in America, and verses from a New England 
poet of more than New England repute. To anyone 
familiar with the narrow limits of Provincetown it will 
be a matter of doubt whether the little place will be 
able to contain itself on that proud day.

A MULTIFARIOUSLY USEFUL PUBLIC LIBRARY is that 

at Grand Rapids, Michigan, of which appreciative 
mention has already been made in these columns. Its 
Thirty-Sixth Annual Report, an elaborate, well-edited, 
well-printed publication of 123 pages, treats of a sur- 
prising number of interesting matters. This library's 
activities are so numerous, without any foolish dissipa- 
tion of energy, that one may safely conceive of its head, 
Mr. Samuel H. Ranck, as a decidedly wide-awake and 



efficient sort of pereon. Lectures, exhibitions, story 
liours for children, readings to the blind, " sunsliine 
work " for the benefit of the shut-in, personal talks to 
young people, the sending out of travelling libraries, — 
these are some of the minor functions of a library that 
circulates more than 250,000 volumes a year among a 
population of about 96,000, and maintains an increasing 
number of branches in various parts of the city. Pos- 
sibly an outsider might indulge in criticism, not so much 
of the library as of the board of health and the hospitals 
of Grand Rapids, for letting a literary institution bear 
the burden of an Anti-Tuberculosis Exliibition and 
coiu-se of lectures, as it generously did last year. A 
curious connection between literature and crime, or 
literature and the decrease of crime, comes to light in 
this Report. The fund aimually available for new 
books is mostly derived from police-court fines and 
county fines, of which the police-court contribution last 
year was eleven hundred dollars less than the year 
before. How much of this falling off, one queries, was 
due to the dissemination of wholesome reading-matter 
by the library? Have we not here a novel kind of 
" vicious circle " ? The greater the usefulness of this 
admirable library, the more does it cripple itself for 
further usefulness,- and vice versa.

The Harvard class poem this year was of such 
merit as to attract attention. One Boston newspaper 
even pronounced it the best class poem ever delivered 
at Cambridge. Its spirited call to engage high-heartedly 
in the battle of life had a swing and a fervor about it — 
trite as was the theme — that quickened the hearer's 
pulse. " On to the walls, and over ! " rang the closing 
refrain, amid applause of manifest spontaneity. Perhaps 
it will not seem an odious comparison to Mr. Hermann 
Hagedorn, the class poet, to say that his performance 
showed all the vigor, and something of the variety in 
facile command of metre, although not a spark of the 
playfid humor, of that most famous in the long list of 
Harvard class poems, Lowell's youthful (not to say boy- 
ish) assault on cant and humbug. As a spoken piece, it 
had the distinct superiority over Lowell's poem of brevity 
and simplicity, or unity. But that product of the 
nineteen-year-old poet's pen was not spoken (whereby 
hangs a tale of woe), nor indeed has it ever been pub- 
lished for general circulation. " The baby arrows of 
that wit " wherewith he " dared assault the wouudless 
Truth " were in mature manhood accounted as but feeble 
shafts by him whose hand had so jamitily sped them. 
Although young swans have a famous way of developing 
anserine traits in later life, one cannot but cherish hopes 
of Mr. Hagedorn's muse. May this lay of his not prove 
too literally — or, rather, metaphorically — the swan- 
song of his muse. ... 

The knight of the comic libretto. Sir William 
Schwenck Gilbert, will be begrudged his new honors by 
no one that has chuckled over his " Bab Ballads," 
applauded the amusing conceits of " H. M. S. Pinafore," 
and laughed uncontrollably at the delicious absurdities 
of " The Mikado." The function of humor in easing 
the stress of our strenuous life is receiving increased 
recognition. Mark Twain has been made a doctor of 
letters by conservative old Oxford, and Mr. Gilbert has 
been knighted by his sovereign. No such honors were 
ever paid to those master humorists. Swift, Sterne, 
Thackeray, and Dickens. Swift, to be sure, was a 
thought too caustic in liis satire, and Sterne not of

irreproachable cleanness of thought ; but the other two, 
if alive to-day — which they could be without being 
centenarians — could hardly fail of being raised to the 
peerage. After the long years that hare feiiuiliarized 
ns with the be-lording of fat-pursed brewers and com- 
plaisant money-changers, it is refreshing to witness, 
now and then, a due tribute paid to letters, even letters 
of the lighter sort. The mission of mirtili, as well as the 
mission of money, is coming to be recognized in high 
quarters. . . . 

Ltteraby achievemkxt after forty is a theme of 
interest to the middle-aged. The masterpieces of men 
and women of eighty and over have already been briefly 
referred to in these columns. A much longer list of 
important works produced by writers of forty and fifty 
could easily be drawn up, as we are reminded by a 
paragraph now being quoted from an English jonrnaL 
Scott had passed the forty line before he really fonnd 
himself and gave to the world the first of his " Waver- 
leys." Mrs. Stowe was forty when she put the finishing 
touches to " Uncle Tom's Cabin." The best work of 
Xewton and Darwin was done after they had counted 
two-soore birthdays ; Swedenborg's " illumination " came 
in his fifties; and " Mother " Eddy, if we mistake not, 
had seen forty summers (besides autumns, winters, and 
springs) before she astonished the world with "Seienee 
and Health, with Key to the Scriptures." 

The HorsE where the ^ Bad Boy " lived — Le. 
the late T. B. Aldrich's Portsmouth home — is likely to 
be preserved as a memorial to the poet. At a public 
meeting of Portsmouth citizens, the mayor presiding, 
measures were adopted for the purchase and preservation 
of the building. Mrs. Aldrich has generously offered to 
repaint and refurnish it in the closest possible conformity 
with its condition during her husband's boyhood, and one 
room is to be especially set apart as a memorial of his 
later literary life and equipped with appropriate remind- 
ers of the man and the writer. And thus, though we 
have no feudal castles or monastic ruins, we are gradu- 
ally ac-quiring a storied atmosphere and enviromnent, 
with our Longfellow and Lowell and Irving houses (to 
name only a few ), our projected monument to Poe, and 
this hoped-for rescue of the most interesting^ straetnic hi 
" Rivermouth." . • , 

A curiosity-coxpeixikg book of the coming season 

will be the long-awaited " Lettere of Queen Victoria," 
on which Mr. A. C. Benson and Lord Elsher have been 
editorially at worii for many months — or, rather, !Mr. 
Benson has been at work in the intervals of writmg half 
a dozen other books, tandem or abreast ; the intensity of 
his lordship's application is only matter of conjecture. 
Presumably the editor of the letters of •* T. B." is findii^ 
it a congenial task to edit those of " V. R." They will, 
it is reported, cover the period from 1837 to 1861, 
presenting a picture of the maiden queen, the young 
wife, and the woman sovereign learning to master affairs 
of state. The later letters, however, would prove more 
interesting to this generation of readers — too interest- 
ing, perhaps, for present publication.

I whether in fiction, history, biography, travel, poetry, or 
any other class.

A GUEAT INBEPENDKNT EDITOR.* 

Tlie eventful life-story of a remarkably gifted,

man is well and fidly told by General James 
Harrison Wilson in his " Life of Charles A. 
Dana." Bom in 1819, at Hinsdale, N. H., of 
purest New England stock, which in turn was 
of genuine Old-England origin, on both father's 
and mother's side, Charles Anderson Dana was 
at nine years of age thrown on the world to battle 
for himself, and also, in part, for two younger 
brothers and a sister. If ever there was a self- 
made man, he was one. Humble toU, patient 
perseverance, thirst for knowledge and its eager 
and rapid acquisition in the face of obstacles, 
admission to Harvard self-taught and uncon- 
ditioned, and two years later a compulsory 
relinquishment of the unequal combat because 
of weakened eyesight — all this, interestingly 
set forth by the biographer, leads up to the 
famous Brook Farm episode in young Dana's 
life ; and that again opens the way to his 
acquaintance with Greeley, his connection with 
" The Tribime," his services to the government 
as special correspondent from General Grant's 
headquarters, his a-ssistant-secretaryship of war, 
and then his return to journalism, first in 
Chicago and finally in New York onee more, 
where his conduct of " The Sun " made him the 
most famous and the most widely read and 
quoted editor of his time, and insured him, when 
he died at his post ten years ago, a deathless 
renown as the bitter enemy of political corrup- 
tion, the ardent advocate of civil liberty, and 
the never-failing friend of reform and progress 
in every walk of life. 

A paragi-aph from the account of Dana's 
experience of community life may serve as the 
first of our somewliat random excerpts from 
chapters that all contain quotable passages. 

" Dana's tastes and inclinations during his connection 
with Brook Farm, while primarily occupied in complet- 
ing his education according to his preconceived notions, 
naturally led him to write for such journals as would 
pay him for his contributions. As the Dial at first, 
and the Harbinger afterwards, were the official organs 
of the association, he by preference wrote much for 
them, but as he covered a multitude of subjects, it 
would be difficult to summarize what he said. While 
it was thoughtful, vigorous, and virile, it was like much 
which goes to make up the sum of our daily lives, of 
but little permanent value. It broadened and strength-

ened his mind, and cultivated his style, which steadily 
became more practical and direct and less fanciful and 
florid. The life of actual labor combined with his intel- 
lectual pursuits and strengthened liis body, improved his 
eyesight, and increased his confidence in himself, and 
this was of the first importance to him at least." 

The oft-told story of the causes leading up 
to our Civil War, its outbreak and, in part, its 
progress, with the subsequent problems of recon- 
ciliation and readjustment, is once more narrated 
at some length in connection with Dana's work 
on " The Tribune " and later in government 
service. His summary dismissal, in 1852, of 
the idea of violent eniancipation shows even his 
prophetic vision to have been sometimes blurred, 
his reading of the signs of the times to have been 
not always correct. The foUowing extract pre- 
sents a picture of him in 1863 as ostensibly a 
" special commissioner of the War Department 
to investigate and report upon the condition of 
the pay service in the Western armies," but 
in reality a confidential agent sent out from 
Washington " to report daily what he might see 
and learn." The author, a member of Grant's 
staff at this time, writes from personal knowl- 
edge and observation. 

" After the foregoing statement it will be understood 
that Dana was received with every mark of respect 
and consideration. He was taken into one of the head- 
quarters' messes on the footing of an officer of the 
highest rank [though his official rank was only that of 
major of volunteers] . His position was a difficult one, 
even with all we did to make it easy for him; but as 
this narrative will show, he tilled it with tact, ability, 
and patriotism to the end. He was at all times not 
only modest and unobtrusive, but alert and ready to 
go where he might observe and learn for himself. In 
the full vigor of life, an excellent horseman and athlete 
entirely without timidity or fear, he was a Iielpful and 
encouraging influence upon all with whom he came in 
contact, and with no one more than with General Grant, 
who adopted towards him the most friendly and cordial 
manner and seemed to take special pleasure in his com- 
pany both in camp and on the march. In fact, Dana 
was in a certain sense a revelation to Grant as well as 
to those of us who were younger. He was not only 
genial, unaffected, and sympathetic in his manners, but 
far and away the best educated and most widely 
informed man that any of us had up to that time ever 
met. His companionship was therefore most acceptable 
and beneficial to all." 

The student of contemporary politics sees 
much to persuade him that this is preeminently 
an age of corruption (of " graft," as the slang 
term lias it) in the public service, of investiga- 
tions and scandal-probing and muck-raking. 
But let him turn back a moment to the period 
of Grant's second term, to the days of the 
Whiskey Ring and the Credit Mobilier, of the 
appointment to high office of the president's 
fat-pursed benefactors, and their subsequent

forced retirement to inglorious privacy : then 
will it perhaps appear that, wicked as we are 
to-day, we have, at least in some respects, made 
progress toward a better state during the last 
third of a century. The following letter ends 
with a phrase that, forty years ago, went the 
roimds of the press and was repeated with 
mocking laughter by its countless readers. The 
letter was written by a Pennsylvania state 
treasurer to "Titian J. Coffey, Esq., Wash- 
ington, D. C." It belongs to the early days of 
Grant's first administration, an era of compara- 
tive virtue. 

" Allow me to introduce to you my particular friend 
Mr. George O. Evaas. He has a claim of some magni- 
tude that he wishes you to help him in. Put him 
through as you would me. He understands Addition, 
Division, and Silence." 

Concerning Dana the etlitor, one short para- 
graph sums up well his main characteristics. 

" It is the testimony of those who had an opportunity 
to know, that no office of any kind was ever more quiet, 
happy, harmonious, and well-governed than was the Sun 
office imder Dana. Every man in it fell unconsciously 
under the sway of his chiers personality, and from the 
first regarded himself as the respected and trusted ser- 
vant of a master whose eye for what was praiseworthy 
was never shut, and whose quick and generous impulse 
was to recognize and reward merit and ability wherever 
he found them. Xo newspaper at that time paid better 
salaries than the Sun and no better school of journalism 
ever existed in this coimtry. While the principal in- 
struction was given by the blue pencil, it was so thorough 
and so effective that those who were fortimate enough 
to receive it «oon came to be known to the press at 
large as ' the clever young men of the Sun,' and many 
of them now hold high and lucrative positions in jour- 
nalism." 

Among personal qualities and gifts for which 
the great editor was little known to the world 
in general were his unusual accomplishments 
as a linguist, his taste and zeal as a collector of 
Chinese porcelain, and his love and practice of 
arboriculture. Ser\ing a few years as clerk in 
a Buffalo dry-goods store, young Dana came 
into trade relations with many civilized Indians 
of the Six Nations ; and to facilitate his deal- 
ings with them he learned to speak their tongue. 
Long afterward, at the siege of Vicksburg. he 
fell in \*-ith a full-blooded Seneca Indian wearing 
a captain's uniform in the Fedei-al army, and 
he greatly astonished the redskin by opening a 
conversation in the Seneca dialect. His ready 
acquisition of French and German helped to 
make him a valuable foreign correspondent to 
" The Tribune " in the revolutionary epoch of 
'48. His facility in German excited the admir- 
ation of General Carl Sehurz in a chat the two 
enjoyed together while riding from Knoxville 



to Chattanooga, in General Wilsons company. 
Spanish, too, and the Scandinavian tongues, 
he spoke with ease. To show the man as dis- 
tinguished from the editor, let two instructive 
passages be given. 

" It follows, almost of course, that a man of such di- 
versified tastes and accomplishments, of such sane and 
enli^tened occupations, must have been a man of rare 
personality; and such was the case. His love of fi ndi n g 
interest for the mind in everything he did made the 
world a joy and a delight to him in all its parts. His 
bodv was as vigorous and healthy as his mind. It was 
in harmony with all its surroimdings. He was a strong 
and sturdy walker, an excellent swimmer, a fair boat- 
man, and an admirable horseman, skilled in all the arts 
of the 'high school.' . . . 

" From what has been said, it should he inferred that 
Dana had practically perfect health throughout life. 
Even such a thing as a headache or a rheumatic pain 
was unknown to him, and notwitanding his exposure at 
times during the Civil War, he never had what could 
be called an ailing moment. Temperate and simple in 
his tastes and habits, he made no complaint of cold, 
hunger, or privation. He was by nature disposed to 
make the best of what life brought to him, and to look 
not only calmly but confidently to the future. He 
claimed but little for himself, but instinctively credited 
his fellow-men with good rather than bad motives. 
Suspicion was foreign to his nature, and although he 
was a man of high passion, strong enthusiasm, and vivid 
imagination, it would have been difficult to find among 
his contemporaries one whose habit of thought and 
philosophy of life were marked by greater sanity or 
more evenly balanced judgment." 

The author has of course drawn freely on 
Dana's published " Recollections of the Civil 
War." as well as on other published and unpub- 
lished sources of information ; but his long and 
intimate acquaintance with and admiration for 
the man have qualified him to write understand- 
ingly without dependence on such outside aid.

Thk Structltkk of English Versk.* 



The average lover of poetry has for so long 
looked down upon versification as being merely 
dry bones, and has been so depressed by the 
difficulty of seeing any relation between some of 
the ndes and the verse that he likes best, that 
he may find it hard to believe in the existence 
of books on prosody which are really interesting 
and stimulating. Mr. T. S. Omond's " English 
Metrists in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth 
Centuries " is one of the most important books 
on versification that have appeared since Sidney

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Lanier's "Science of English Verse " came out 
in 1880. It is quite as noteworthy in one direc- 
tion as the fii-st volume of Professor Saintsbury's 
" History of English Prosody " is in another. 
What Mr. Omond undertakes to do, and what 
he actually accomplishes surpassingly well, is 
to give a brief summary of whatever in the past 
two hundred years various writers on English 
prosody have put forth in explanation of the 
structure of our verse. The number of theorists 
Mr. Omond thus passes imder review will cer- 
tainly astonish all but the very few who know 
how extensive the bibliography of the subject 
is ; for even the more prominent of these theorists 
have been ignorant of the work of many of their 
predecessors, and have therefore often claimed 
a priority that belonged to others. 

Mr. Omond has his own theory, as those 
know who have read his admirable " Study of 
Metre " (London, 1903) ; but in this latest vol- 
ume he shows a most exhilarating degree of 
fairness and discrimination. He has a keen 
eye for original thinking, and for attempts to 
get at the facts of our verse-structure ; and he 
does not allow any heap of rubbish in the sliape 
of iU-expressed or ill-applied theories to keep 
him from imcovering whatever is worthy of 
praise. 

At the outset, Mr. Omond defines his terms, 
and re-states his theory of verse, which he first 
set forth in his " Study of Metre." Quantity, 
he explains, refers " solely to the time syllables 
take to pronovmce," and this depends " either 
on vowel-duration or on retardation by sepa^ 
rately pronounced consonants." As compared 
with the Greeks and Romans, "we have a 
powerful stress-accent, which reduces quantitar 
tive distinction to low and fluctuating values ; 
they, apparently, had a very slight one."' Of 
accent, he says : 

"Three elements must be distinguished in every 
spoken sound — pitch, force, and duration. I purposely 
use the least ambiguous terms. Pitch is synonymous 
with height of tone, force with loudness ; dviration repre- 
sents what we have just called ' quantity.' These three 
elements are distinct and different, separable always in 
thought, separated often in practice. No analysis can 
be accurate which confuses them. In the books before 
us accent is defined sometimes as one of these (each in 
turn by different writers ! ), sometimes as any two of 
them, occasionally as all three together. At present it 
is usually defined as consisting of force. ... I submit 
that, as a matter of fact, 'accent' with us does not 
necessarily imply either elevation of pitch, or increase 
of loudness, or prolongation of time. Normally we 
like to unite all three on one syllable, and this is prob- 
ably our commonest type of accent" (pp. 2-4). 

The writers Mr. Omond deals with agree in 
one point. 



" Unanimously they assert that accentuation plays in 
our verse the part that quantity did in Greek and Latin. 
Even this, surely, is but a half-truth. How can accen- 
tuation form a basis of metre ? It is an intensive, not 
an exteusive, factor. The phi-<ise ' accentual foot ' in- 
volves a misconception. The essential quality of a 
'foot' is duration, and this is not created by accent. 
Without doubt, accentuation is the most saUent feature 
of our verse, as ' quantity ' of Classic verse. But to 
presume identity between their fiuietions is illogical. 
The one records time, the other only illustrates it. With 
us, accent is mainly a signalizing element. It calls 
attention to periods, but does not and cannot create 
these. So far as it makes the voice linger on a syllable, 
it becomes a constitutive element in verse ; but its main 
function is to emphasize the recurrence " (pp. 5-6). 

Mr. Omond believes, in short, that syllables do 
not make feet ; they either whoUy or in part 
fill up feet, and feet are merely temporal units. 
Of course, Mr. Omond is opposed to syllable- 
counting, which practically ruled in the eight- 
eenth century and still persists as a most pes- 
tilent heresy ; he is opposed to every theory of 
verse which does not take into careful account 
the element of time. 

Mr. Omond divides the two huudre<l years 
of his survey into four equal periods, to each of 
which he devotes a chapter. The first chapter, 
on " The Old Orthodoxy," fills only sixteen 
pages ; for Edwai-d Bysshe, Gent., in his " Art 
of Poetry," 1702 (with many later editions), 
fairly represents not only what had preceded 
him, but what was to follow almost exclusively 
until after 1750. To be sure, there was one 
small protest by John Mason in his two " Essays 
on the Power of Numbers," 1749 ; but Mason 
surpassed the rest only by recognizing some- 
thing of the clo.se analogy between verse and 
music. All our verse-criticism up to 1750 is 
based on authority, on dogmatic assertions as to 
what our verse ought to be, and not at all on 
analysis of what it actually is. 

The period between 1750 and 1800, which 
Mr. Omond calls that of " Resistance and Re- 
bellion," started out like the first one, with a 
substitution of " assertion for argument, and 
imagination for fact," in the Granunar prefixed 
to Dr. Samuel Johnson's Dictionary. Of Thomas 
Warton's " History of English Poetry," the 
first volvmie of which appeared in 1774, Mr. 
Omond says : 

" Students speak with respect of its siu^vey of our 
elder literatiu'e, and at the time it was thought wonder- 
ful. But to us the most astonishing fact about it is that 
it contains absolutely no discussion of verse-structure. 
This enidite and accomplished historian of our poetry 
never asks himself what is the actual nature of the verse 
he is describing. . . . Historically, his survey is admi- 
rable; philosophically, it is naught. I do not think a 
more striking uistance could be fomid of how entirely

English scholarship had blinked the qneston of prosody, 
taking for granted a traditional view which applied 
Latin rules to English verse without ever enquiring 
whether as a matter of fact sueh application were pos- 
sible and justifiable" (pp. 41-2). 

In 1775, however, came the most remarkable 
book on prosody of the whole centurv — Joshua 
Steele's •• Essay Towards Establishing the 
Melody and Measure of Speech, to be Expressed 
and Perpetuated by Peculiar Symbols,"' which 
in a second edition in 1779 was called •' Pro- 
sodia Rationalis." Of Steele. 3>Ir. Omond 
writes: 

"For the first time (I believe) in the history of our 
literature, a writer proclaims that verse is essentially 
matter of musical rhythm, and applies musical methods 
frankly and fully to the aotation of metre " (p 57). 

Steele's great innovation was the recognition of 
rests or pauses. ^Ir. Omond's comment on this 
is worth giving in full, because it gets at the 
very heart of the whole matter. 

'• This last idea was wholly new. The ' pauses ' spoken 
of by earlier writers were merely csesnral divisions, 
affecting the debvery rather than the substance of a 
line ; Steele was first to treat tbem as Actors of metre. 
That this should be so is truly surprising, and shows the 
artificiality of previous prosody. For, surely, it is a 
adf-evident proposition that in any ordered succession 
of articulate or inarticulate sounds an interval of sflenoe 
may on occasion be substituted for utterance, and may 
count toward the total result; just as in dancing a 
measured interval of quiescence may form part of the 
' steps,' or as in music ' rests ' are an integral part of 
the bar. Incredible as it may seem, this obvious fact 
had escaped notice, and was not admitted even after 
Steele called attention to it. Succeeding metrists, 
except a few avowed followers of Steele, ignored it in 
their teaching, as to this day it is ignored in the ' Pros- 
ody ' Section of our grammars. Coleridge never men- 
tions it in his references to metre. Poe does not notice 
it in his protest against scholastic scansion, not even 
when it would seem impossible to avoid doing so. As 
lately as 1870, Professor Sylvester appears to claim it 
as his own peculiar discovery. During recent years not 
a few writers have, as they were well entitled to do, 
recognised its obvious reality. Yet when in my ' Study 
of Metre ' I took it more or less for granted (as I have 
done since the first day I began to think about verse- 
structure), many of ray reviewers pronoonced this 
revolutionary. I should have deemed it a matter hardly 
needing demonstration that pauses as well as syllables 
go to make up a metrical unit " (p. 58). 

In the third chapter, on " The New Verse,"' 
the poets themselves b^in to be prominent ; 
Coleridge. Southey. and Poe are matched in 
importance only by Guest. The chapter b^;ins 
with a discussion of precisely what Coleridge 
meant by his principle of '* counting in each 
line the accents, not the syllables." Mr. Omond's 
explanation is that •' Coleridge's practice, if not 
his definition, restored time to its true pre- 
eminence. He does not say that his accents 



occur at equal intervals, bat oar ears tell as 
that they do. The • feet " are uniform in length, 
though diverse in the niunber of syllables they 
oontain " (p. 89). 

In "The North American Review " for Sep- 
tember. 1819, appeared the first American con- 
tribution to English prosody — William Cullen 
Bryant's article on " Trisyllabic Feet in Iambic 
Measures." Southey 's importance to prosody 
consists in his having started a tremendous con- 
troversy by publishing, in 1821, his " Vision of 
Judgment " in '• English hexameters." Guest's 
" History of English Rhythms."' 1838, owed its 
importance in the first place to the fact that it 
has been until very recently our most exhaustive 
treatise in English, and in the second place to 
the fact that^ with its seriously mistaken notions, 
it has for two generations been accepted as 
authoritative. The period closed in 1848 with 
Poes •• Rationale of English Verse," which ]SIr. 
Omond calls "incomparably the most impor- 
tant contribution to prosodic study at this time " 
(p. 138). 

In the chapter on " The New Prosody, 1850- 
1900," Mr. Omond singles out for special praise 
A. J. Ellis, Coventiy- Patmore. J. B. ilayor. 
Professor Gummere, A. H. Tolman ; and above 
all these, and fairly rivalling Joshua Steele in 
epochal importance, he puts Sidney Lanier. 
Walt ^Tiitman he considers very important 
as raising in acute form the question whether 
metre is essential to poetry. 

" Whether irregular rhythms such as those favoured 
by Whitman will ultimately oust the more regular, — 
whether, to go no fitrtber, recondite harmonies of 
prose, often nobly illustrated by Whitman, will finally 
supersede the more definite tliytluns of verse, — these 
are qnestions which no eritie can answer " (p. 148). 

If we omit even men of deserved prominence 
and importance, and pick out (mly those who 
according to ilr. Omond have made the greatest 
contribution to a satisfactory theory of English 
metres, we find that these men are Joshua Steele 
(1775), Edgar Allan Poe (1848), Coventry 
Patmore (1859), and Sidney Lanier (1880). 
It is pleasant to find that three of these men 
are poets of repute, but rather surprising to 
find that these three have written within the last 
sixty years. 

Mr. Omond values highly another's " deter- 
mination " in defending a theory, and he is 
singularly candid and open-minded. At the 
end, although he has throughout criticised from 
the point of view of his own theory, he declares : 

"Here is a cardinal point on which contzadiefaKy 
opinions still prevail. At the end of the

century, people are still asking whether a bar of verse 
may — or, at least, for several centuries did — contain 
now two and now three syllables. We may think that 
the question answers itself; but such is not the belief of 
all experts. The very fomidations of English prosody 
are still in doubt. Its ' essential prmciple ' cannot be 
said to liave been placed beyond question " (p. 225). 

Mr. Omond had intended to close his survey 
with 1900, but the contributions since that date 
have been so many (he enumerates more than 
twenty-five in his confessedly imperfect list) 
and so interesting that he added a Postscript of 
seventeen pages. 

Misprints are noticeably few, and the refer- 
ences are admirably exact and painstaking. 
At the end of the volume are two Appendices 
of atlditions and corrections, one to Mr. Omond's 
previously published list of English quantitative 
verse, the other to his old list of works dealing 
with English verse-structure by native writers. 
It is a matter of regret that Mr. Omond did not 
incorporate these appendices in revised lists 
which he might either have bound in with this 
volume or issued separately. It is earnestly to 
be hoped that he may still see his way to giving 
us these revised lists, which are exceptionally 
complete and acciu-ate.

One of the Oldest of Handicrafts.* 

The greater accessibility in recent years of 
the rich stores of historical documents in private 
possession in England, as well as those preserved 
in the national archives, has been an inestimable 
boon to students in many fields. Without the 
aid afforded by these ancient records, a work 
so thorough and comprehensive as Mr. W. G. 
Thomson's " History of Tapestry " could not 
have been written. The records have, as he teUs 
us in his preface, been " fi-eely used," the residt 
being " the discovery of manufactories never 
chronicled m books on Tapestry, fuller informal 
tion about those already known, and much fresh 
material relating to Tapestries in general.'' 
The large yield from these researches, supple- 
menting the author's expert knowledge, has 
enabled him to write what must take rank as 
the standard work on one of the oldest of the 
handicrafts.

lead up to the main subject — the elaborate 
hangings that fi-om a very early period down to 
modern times were such an important feature 
in the furnishing of churches, palaces, and the 
dwellings of all who could afford such costly 
luxury. The sketch of tapestry weaving in 
Egypt, Greece, and Rome, in ancient times, is 
most interesting, and is properly marketl by 
restrained and cautious statement. Still, the 
avoidance of definite expression occasionally 
suggests unwarrantable inference, as in the 
ca.se of the famous hangings from Babylon, 
mentioned by Pliny, afterward bought by Nero 
for a sum estimated as equal to about #80,000 
of our money. They may have been tapestries ; 
but it woidd not have been out of place to men- 
tion the uncertainty as to their precise nature. 
The term tajjestry, it is perhaps well to explain, 
is a technical plu-ase designating a particular 
weave in which, to quote Mr. Thomson's defi- 
nation, " the weft or horizontal threatl is pressed 
down so as to envelop completely and conceal the 
warp or vertical threads." It is a curious fact 
that one of the most ancient textile fabrics in 
existence, a piece of white linen from the tomb 
of Thoutmosis IV., about 1449 B. c, is tapestry 
woven. The Egyptian weavers in the course of 
many centuries deyelojjed extraordinary skUl. 
Bits of tapestry now extant that were woven by 
them for dress material evoke Mr. Thomson's 
imrestrained enthusiasm. 

" Perfect in colour, gossamer-like in its sUken and 
Unen textiu-e of exquisite fineness, need we wonder that 
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries specimens of it 
brought westwards were attributed to the powers of 
enchanters and fairies?" 

In Western Europe, during the early ages 
and up to the fourteenth century, the weaving 
of tapestry was almost universal in the monas- 
teries, but the total output was probably not 
very large. With the crusades came a taste 
for luxurious appointments, stimidated by the 
magnificence of the carpets and hangings of the 
East. Gradually centres of secidar manufacture 
of tapestry grew up, and by the beginning of 
the fifteenth centuiy the industry liad become 
one of gi'eat importance. It is not easy for us 
to realize the part that tapestry played in the 
life of people of that period. In the mansions 
of the great it was the chief furnishing. For 
festive occasions, pageants, and elaborate cere- 
monials, it was indispensable. Of the entrance 
into London of Elizabeth, Queen of Henry VII., 
we read that " Al the strets ther, whiche she 
shulde passe bye wer clenly dressed and besene 
with cloth of Tappestrye and Arras ; and some

streetes an Chepe, hanged with riche clothes of 
golde, velvettes and silkes." 

The most highly esteemed of these sumptuous 
hangings were the products of the looms of the 
Flemish town of Arras, which during the first 
half of the fifteenth century was the principal 
centre of tapestry weaving. Under the liberal 
|jatronage of Philip the Good, Diike of Bur- 
gundy, the tapestries of Arras became world- 
famous. Not only were the weavers most skilful, 
but no pains were spared to secure designs from 
the most competent hands. With the accession 
of Charles the Bold, the fortunes of the town 
began to decline : and when, in 1477, it was 
captured by King Louis XI., its fate was sealed. 
The taxes and restrictions laid upon the weavers 
were so onerous that within two years nearly 
all of them had emigrated. Though in 1484 
Kins Charles VIII. strove to rcAave the indus- 
try, his efforts met with no success. Its great 
centre had been destroyed as effectually as the 
earlier centre of tapestry wea^-ing in Paris had 
been destroyed by the English occupation under 
Henry V. 

The tapestries woven in Toumai in the fif- 
teenth century were scarcely less celebrated than 
those of Arras, and there were many excellent 
weavers in other towns in Flanders and else- 
where in Western Europe. The artistic quality 
of their products suffered no marked deteriora- 
tion imtU Pope Leo X., in 1515, commissioned 
Raphael Sanzio to design a set of ten cartoons 
of the Acts of the Apostles, which were sent 
to Brussels to be woven. Very properly. Mr. 
Thomson lays stress upon the malign influence 
these famous cartoons were destined to exercise. 
As he points out, 

" With the execution of the cartoons of Raphael, one 
of the most rapid changes of style in any art took place 
in Brussels. Dramatic and pictorially decorative com- 
positions took the place of the old crowded and formal 
arrangements. Tapestry, without imitating the tech- 
nique of painting, became as it were a woven picture 
or fresco in aught else. The excessive richness due to 
wealtli of detail in natural objects such as flowers was 
discontinued, and with it went the loving treatment of 
things inanimate. Richness of effect was attempted 
more by the iLse of broad spaces worked in gold and 
silver than by elaborate pattern." 

Dazzled by the reputation of the foremost 
artist of his day, men faile<l to perceive the 
unsuitability of his designs for the purpose of 
reproduction as tapestry. If the weavers, to 
whom they presentetl strange problems, recog- 
nizetl this truth, their taste was overborne by 
commercial considerations. Even the old de- 
sigms had erred through too much realism. In 
general it may be said that superb as were 



' many of the hangings made from them, lovely 
in texture and in color, their artistic value was 
seldom of a high order. The verj' nature of 
tapestry calls for conventional design, or in 
other words for design carefully adapted to the 
process of weaving and the effects proper to it. 

j The old verdures and archaic renderings of 

' figures and architectural details were right in 
principle. And in modem times the beautifid 
hangings woven at Merton Abbey from the 
designs of William Morris and Sir Edwin Bume- 
Jones conform to every canon of good taste. As 
for the pictorial tapestries of the sixteenth 
century and later, while they are remarkable as 

i tours de force of weaving, they have small merit 
as works of art. And for the most part, time, 
by destroying their charm of color, has left 
little that can justly claim our a^lmiration. 

This phase of the subject Mr. Thomson 
avoids, though a stray word here and there 
indicates that his ideas upon it are sound. He 
writes as a historian, not as a critic. Some of 
the tales he tells, as, for example, that of the 
^-icissitudes of the hangings of "The Apocalypse'' 
in the cathedral of Angers, are stranger than 
fiction. And occasionally there is a peep into 
general historj', as the reference to the dis- 
patching by Henry VIII., who was a most 
enthusiastic tapestry collector, of agents to Ant- 
werp on the pretext of buying hangings, but in 
realitj- to acquire political intelligence. Lists 
of roj^al collections, names of weavers, and a 
wealth of miscellaneous data of various kinds, 
are scattered through the book. The history of 
tapestry manufacture in England is told for the 
first time, in especial an ample account being 
given of the factory established at Mortlake in 
the seventeenth century. At the end of the 
volume is a valuable chapter devoted to weavers' 
marks. In it are represented aU that are known 
to have been used by the tapissiers since the 
r^ulation promidgated at Brussels in 1528, 
making it obligatory that everj- piece of more 
than six ells woven in the town should be 

, marked. The illustrations are nimierous and 
well selected. Many of them, notably the 
reproductions in color of the famous " Hunting 
Tapestries " at Hardwicke Hall, accounted the 
finest fifteenth century hangings preserved in 
England, are from drawings by the author. 
Altogether the book is a most satisfactory one. 
It is not only a treasury of information, but .so 
cleverly have the innumerable details been 

j woven into the narrative that it is readable as 
well as interesting.

[July 16, 



The Mistress of the Adihatic* 



The great cities of Italy — Rome, Florence, 
Venice, Milan, and the rest — have long been 
objects of profound interest, not only to the 
traveller but to the student as well, especially 
to the student of histoiy. It is probable that 
this interest will long continue, though at times 
the student's attention will doubtless be at- 
tracted more strongly toward one city tlian 
another. If we may judge from the number of 
recent works dealing with the history of Venice, 
we shall have to conclude that at present the 
chief interest centres about the wonderful city 
on the Adriatic. 

Among those who have made a serious study 
of the Venetian past, perhaps none is more 
eminent than the Italian historian Pompeo 
Molmenti. By birth a Venetian, he is naturally 
attracted to the history of his native state, a 
history " fidl of varied episodes, some felicitous, 
some disasti'ous, almost all glorious." But the 
story of the Doges has been told so often by 
winters of eminence that on the narrative side of 
the subject little that is new can be found to teU. 
Professor Molmenti, however, as an art critic 
and a teacher of literature, is naturally inter- 
ested in other matters than what we usually call 
" events "; he is drawn toward the more intel- 
lectual phases of his country's development — its 
laws, culture, and mode of life. Twenty-seven 
years ago he published his first important work, 
a study of Venetian history " as revealed in the 
private life of the people." But this was merely 
an introductory essay. Since its publication the 
author has continued his researches, collected 
more materials, and developed newer views ; 
these are to be published in a large work of six 
volumes in which is traced the individual growth 
of the city " from the earliest beginnings to the 
fall of the republic." The volumes are divided 
topically into three sections (two vokunes each), 
the first section dealing with mediaeval Venice, 
the second with the golden age of the city, 
and the third with the years of its decadence. 
Sinndtaneously with the Italian publication an 
English translation is appearing, the work of Mr. 
Horatio F. Brown, British archivist in Venice, 
widely known as an authority on Venetian sub- 
jects. The first section comprises two attractive 
volumes of about five himdred pages, provided 
with a large number of excellent illusti-ations, 
mainly copies of contemporary illuminations

ninirs to the Fall of the Republic. By Pompeo Molmenti.

and photographs of historic remains such as 
monuments, buildings, and works of art. Of 
the translator's work, so far as it has been com- 
pleted, the reviewer's criticism must be favor- 
able tliroughout ; stiU, it is unfortunate that 
so many passages have been left mitranslated. 
The reader who knows Italian will no doubt de- 
light in the numerous citations of Italian verse, 
but the general reader also is entitled to some 
consideration, and it is unfortunate that so much 
Latin and Romance should be insertetl in an 
English edition without even an English para- 
phrase in a foot-note. 

What impresses the reader first of all is the 
absence of narrative, as that term is commonly 
applied. Professor Molmenti's history is de- 
scriptive ; it deals with institutions and customs, 
with social castes and classes, with the material 
interests of the entire popidation, not with the 
achievements of individual leaders and states- 
men. Names of prominent Venetians are indeed 
mentioned, and their work is to some extent dis- 
cussed, especially in the chapters on Fine Arts 
and Culture ; but, as a ride, personages are 
brought into history merely to determine the 
chronology. The history is a series of essays 
each of which carries its particidar theme down 
to the close of the middle ages. An introduc- 
tory chapter discusses the origins of the city and 
of the early settlements. Other topics are the 
appearance of the city, its houses and public 
buildings, its constitution and laws, its systems 
of conmierce, its finance and economy, the vari- 
ous classes of its population, popular festivals, 
martial exercises, and amusements. The second 
volume is devoted to the more intellectual phases 
of Venetian civilization — manners, customs, the 
industrial arts, the fine arts, and cidture. At 
the close of this volmne the author lias added a 
number of mediaeval documents which the his- 
torical student will find exceedingly useful. 

We usually thmk of Venice as a product of 
the troublous times in the fifth century when 
Huns and Germans were terrorizing the civilized 
south. Professor Molmenti does not dispute 
the venerable story that the city originated as a 
refuge from the wrath of Attila ; but he holds 
that the islands — or some of them at least — 
in the upper Adriatic had been inhabited for 
centuries, and that the movement referred to 
must not be given too much credit. He thor- 
oughly discredits the story that Venice was born 
free and always remained independent, as early 
Venetians have taught. " Such complete inde- 
pendence was not in the spirit of the age, and no 
Latin race would ever have dreamed of refusing

to acknowledge, at least in outward form, its 
obligations toward the Roman Empire and, 
later, toward the Greek." The author dates the 
beginning of " the glorious history of Venice " 
from 814, when the Doge removed the seat of 
government to Rialto. 

That a large part of the work should be de- 
voted to commerce, finance, and related subjects, 
is to be expected ; but so great were the achieve- 
ments of the city in these regards that the author 
has had to content himself with giving compar- 
atively brief sunmiaries instead of detailed ac- 
counts. An interesting subject is that of explo- 
ration and colonization. '• San !Marco sent his 
children far afield in search of fortune ; and the 
constitution of the Republic, and even the very 
aspect of Venice herself, were reproduced in for- 
eign cities. Whole colonies of Venetians settled 
abroad and were protected bj- special laws and 
by their own consuls." When we remember the 
journeys of Marco Polo into eastern Asia, and the 
explorations of the Zeno brothers in the North 
Atlantic, we realize the truth of the statement 
that the mediaeval Venetian did wander far afield . 
Professor Molmenti gives full credence to the 
Zeno letters, and holds that Niccolb Zeno actually 
" touched the coasts of Newfoundland and New 
England." He also appears to believe that the 
Norse colonies in America, which were planted 
in the eleventh eenturj'. were still existing when 
Zeno visited this continent in the fourteenth cen- 
tury. It must be said, however, that while the 
audiors conclusions on this point are interesting. 
they do not seem to be founded on a sufficient 
study of all the available evidence. 

The second volvune does not record such re- 
markable achievements as the first ; in the middle 
ages the material culture of Venice was always 
far in ad\-ance of the intellectual. Especially was 
the literature of the city wanting in poetry. 

" The vast and silent spaces of the lagoon would seem 
to unlock the dirine fount of song, and yet the mnses 
were never held in high esteem in Venice, or perhaps it 
would be truer to say they were never worthily wooed, 
and never attained any great influence upon general cul- 
ture, even when refinement had reached a high standard. 
The genius of the Venetians was always more inclined 
to matters of trade, to political discussion, to severe 
studies, than to the graces of verse and song." 

The city possessed, as the author clearly demon- 
strates, a varied and \Tgorous culture, but both 
in purpose and in character it was almost wholly 
utilitarian. But Professor Molmenti also finiis 
much to say in defence of Venetian learning : 
it was, after all, in many respects of a higher 
character than that which flourished at the courts 
of the Italian despots. •• The state of Venice 



was strong enough in wealth and wisdom to dis- 
pense with the purchased praises of the erudite ; 
Venice, if she did call to her service the learned, 
did not do so to purchase facile compliments, 
but to instruct her youth destined to high public 
office, and to open schools for the teaching of 
grammar, rhetoric, and other useful sciences." 
To our author, any extraordinary developments 
in the realm of intellectual culture seem to mean 
the passing of youth, the failure of energy, and 
the call for rest, ease, and comfort. " By the 
end of the fifteenth centurj- the mistress of the 
seas had reaped the harvest of her energy, of 
her activity, of her sacrifices : but her splendor, 
which had already touched its apogee, now began 
to pass into the region of culture and of art, and 
already held in itself the earliest germs of decay." 
Laurence M. Larson. 



The Poet of DisrLLUsiOJfMExr.* 



In a sur\"ey of the development of realism in 
literature, George Crabbe has a distinctive place 
among pioneer leaders of the movement in En- 
^and. He soimded a challenge in verse against 
the merely idyllic and romantic with as much 
force as did Jane Austen and Fielding in fic- 
tion. He framed detailed contrasting pictures 
of country life and its yeomanry, to correct the 
idealized portrayals of similar scenes by Gray 
and Goldsmith. In his life and literary im- 
pulses, Crabbe was limited in vision ; he lacked 
the love of beauty and the sympathy of Cowper 
and Wordsworth, yet he had keen observation, 
good skill in delineating certain kinds of char- 
acters, and an undaimted love of the truth. 
These qualities, while they brought him the title 
of " the poet of disillusionment." yet gave to 
" The Village," " The Parish Register,'" and 
" Tales in Verse " some merits of real literary 
value. 

These general thoughts are recalled by the 
new biography, in translation, of Crabbe, written 
by M. Rene Huchon and well rendered into 
English by Mr. Frederick Clarke. As a basis 
of biographic facts, the standard life of Crabbe's 
son, published seventy years ago, is chosen ; 
while new material is incorporated and new 
interpretation of the poet's work is freely offered. 
From his mother Crabbe inherited a strain of 
nuld piety : but the robust father, with excesses 
of temper and habits, left his influence upon his

son in many ways, notably in a love of science 
and a fondness for the sea. In " The Village " 
and " The Borough," Crabbe photogi-aphed 
certain features of his early life at Aldborough, 
and of his visits to the sailors' cabins, where he 
listened to their wierd tales and was fascinated 
by curious relics from foreign shores. He was 
a lad of dreamy, imaginative nature, keen in 
sensibility and in pride. At thirteen his school- 
days were ended, and he passed thi-ough vicis- 
situdes, lai'gely painful and irritating, for seven 
years, as apprentice to apothecaries at Wickham 
Brook and Woodbridge. These experiences, 
coupled with a keen study of men and women 
of unfortunate lives, awakened his satire against 
the rich and led to his psychological portrayal 
of outcasts and down-trodden men tod women 
in his mature poems. 

There was one compensating pleasure and 
influence for good during these vexing years of 
youth, namely, his friendship for Sarah Elmy, 
the " Mira " of his poems, who became his wife 
after many years of patient waiting for him to 
win recognition and income. During the sea- 
sons of discouragement and promise alike, he 
kept alive his mental interests, studying botany 
and geology as well as medicine, and writing 
poetry spasmodically. After a futile effort to 
enlist the patronage of Lord North, he finally 
gained the interest of Burke, to whom he sent 
the prospectus of his poem on " The Library." 
From this encouragement dates the success of 
Crabbe's literary work. 

Burke was a true friend to Crabbe for many 
years ; he paid his debts, made him his com- 
panion, urged him to study for the church, and 
finally secured for him a place as curate at 
Aldborough, in 1781. The villagers, however, 
were inclined to sneer at the new curate whom 
they had known as work-boy and apprentice, 
and Crabbe was glad to secure a place as do- 
mestic chaplain to the Duke of Rutland, while 
he took revenge on his feUow-townsmen by 
many lines of satire in " The Village." Through 
the opportimities offered at the palace of his 
noble patron, he met Joshua Reynolds, Dr. 
Johnson, and other men of note. To Dr. 
Johnson he submitted the manuscript of " The 
Village " for revision, and the honored critic of 
the day pronoimced the poem to be " original, 
vigorous, and elegant." This panoi-ama in verse, 
like nearly all of Crabbe's work, lacked unity, 
and was too purposeful to be artistic. 

One of the best examples of Crabbe's mode of 
procedure against the conventional treatment of 
the beauties of the country is found in this poem. 



" Fled are those times, when iii harmonious strains, 
The rustic poet praised his native plains: 
Rank weeds, that every art and care defy, 
Reign o'er the land, and rob tlie blighted rye; 
There thistles stretch their prickly anns afar, 
And to the ragged infant threaten war; 
There poppies, nodding, mock the hope of toil; 
There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil; 
Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf, 
The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf; 
O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade, 
And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade; 
With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound. 
And a sad splendor vainly shines around." 

"The Newspaper" was a return to more 
impersonal and artificial themes, as in " The 
Library "; but these discursive satires and dis- 
sertations in rhyme are forgotten, while " The 
Village," "The Borough," and "The Parish 
Register " are still significant. Domestic trials 
came rapidly to Crabbe, culminating in the 
illness of his wife and the loss of her mental 
balance during the remainder of a long life. 
She remained, however, the chief care and ob- 
ject of her husband's affection ; he never wearied 
in seeking comforts for her and gratifying 
her childish whims. In " The Borough " and 
" The Parish Register " he found saving relief 
from these home-trials and the routine of a 
coimtry curate's life. Looking over an imagi- 
nary page of a parish register, divided into 
three parts — births, marriages, and deaths — 
the poet introduced varied types, aristocracy, 
clergy, shopkeepers, laborers, and gave in the 
completed form of the poem a vivid realistic 
picture of English rural life at the end of the 
eighteenth century. 

By grouping such isolated characters and 
scenes as he had chosen to portray in his earlier 
poems, and weaving a romantic thread of action, 
he reached a natural sequence in " The Tales in 
Verse," " Tales of the HaU," and " Posthumous 
Tales." While his characters in these later 
" Tales " are no more vigorously drawn than 
some of those in " The Village " and " The 
Borough" — like Fanny Price, Widow Goe, 
Isaac Ashford " the noble peasant," pretty 
Phoebe Dawson, and Peter Grimes the fisher- 
man, — yet the men and women act and react 
upon each other through distinct motives, as is 
well outlined by M. Huchon. Nearly all of the 
" Tales " are pathetic, sometimes tragic ; yet a 
few have less " pathos of disenchantment " and 
more optimism of outlook, as " The Confidant " 
and the idyll of " Jesse and Colin." The last 
lines of this latter poem summarize Crabbe's 
philosophy of happiness, the quiet joy of simple 
domestic life.

" I know not if thev live 
With all the comforts wealth and plenty give; 
But with pore joy to envious souls denied. 
To suppliant meanness and suspicious pride; 
And village maids of happy couples say, 
' They live like Jesse Bourn and Colin Grey.' " 

The happiest years of Crabbe's life, in the 
opinion of this biographer, were passed at 
Trowbridge from 1813-1818, the place asso- 
ciated in our memories with FitzGerald and the 
Quaker Bernard Barton. Journeys to London, 
entertainments at Holland House, and acquaint- 
ance with Moore, Campbell, and Scott, gave 
\-arietT and zest to these quiet years. M. Huchon 
disputes, if he does not disprove, Lockhart's ver- 
sion of Crabbe's visit to Scott; indeed, a severe 
tone of criticism toward Lockhart appears oc- 
casionally throughout the l)ook. At times the 
narrative is too discursive — the five hundred 
pages might be condensed to advantage ; but on 
the whole it is a just and clear biography, with 
sympathetic interpretation. The author makes 
no claim of poetic superiority for Crabbe ; he 
emphasizes dtdy the limitations and bourgeoisie 
of his nature, and the prosaic qualities of his 
subjects, but he also pays tribute to his integrity, 
courage, and true influence as preacher and poet.

tary, that prevented Kentucky from seceding from 
the Union. In a volume entitled •• The Union Cause 
in Kentucky. 1861-65" (Putnam). The author 
was much dissatisfied, he says, with the way in which 
Kentucky historians have written about the Civil 
War period, and so has undertaken to correct some 
of their mistakes. Professor Shaler of Harvard, who 
wrote the volume on Kentucky in the " American 
Commonwealths " series, receives rough treatment 
at the hands of Captain Speed. Shaler was also a 
Union soldier from Kentucky, but Speed asserts that 
he was entirely too favorable to the Confederates of 
that state. The book under review is mainly an 
attempt to disprove certain propositions of Professor 
Shaler, which may be summarized as follows : The 
Kentucky Confederates were from the wealthier 
families of the fertile Blue Grass section, while the 
Unionists were poorer people from thinner soik ; 
the Confederates were younger men and made better 
soldiers than the Unionists : the s%-mpathies of Ken- 
tucky were really with the .South, but she was held 
in the Union vi et armis ; during the war the Fed- 
eral provost marshals were guiltj- of the grossest 
outrages against Southern sympathizers. To prove 



that these conclusions are wrong is the task that 
I Captain Speed undertakes. The attempt is not 
I altogether successful The work has those faults 
to which the author objects so strongly in the other 
state historians. It is a frankly partisan account 
of the Union side, just as some of the others are 
biassed accounts in favor of the Confederates. The 
method employed is interesting, but unfortunately 
not convincing. The author qaotes objectionable 
passages from Shaler and others, and then proceeds 
to demolish them with statements of his own views 
or with quotations of opinion from others with whom 
\ he agrees. The result is that much of the work 
consists merely of denials of the conclusions of other 
writers. There is little of the historical temper mani- 
fested: the account of Professor Shaler is far more 
temperate and philosophical. But aside from these 
&uilts, which are serious, there is much that is useful 
in the work. The author g^ves a good account of 
how the Unionists organized their forces, in 1861, 
to hold Kentucky in the Union. This part of the 
book coold not have Ijeen better done. Of consid- 
erable value and interest also are the lists given of 
Unionist leaders, election statistics, and enlistment 
statistics. Other informing chapters are those on 
the location of Union sentiment, the fighting within 
the state, the guerrillas, and Morgan's raids. In 
spite of Captain Speed's controversial method, which 
canses him often to neglect facts for arguments and 
opinions, the work will be found useful for it is the 
best available source of information about the Union 
eanse in Kentucky.

by Jostos Lipsius (1547—1606), translated by the 
chief editor of the series. Mr. John Cotton Dana, 
with an introductory note by Mr. Henry W. Kent, 
the assistant editor. This slender account of the 
libraries of Egypt, Pergamum, Greece, and Rome 
(the earlier Assyrian and Babylonian libraries of 
baked clay are not mentioned) is rated at its full 
value, and perhaps a little more, by the zealous 
editors, to whom the things of their profession are 
of such preponderating importance that the excel- 
lent Lipsius is thus spoken of in the Introduction : 
"Whatever defects of matter or style our writer may 
have had, like all the humanists he served a great 
purpose in retailing to further generations — and 
especially to librarians — the opinions of the classic 
writers on the history of libraries," Were there 
then no humanists uninterested in library history, 
or silent on the subject? Lipsius was a prodigious 
bookworm, but the results of his burrowings must 
sometimes be taken wnth a grain of salt — as his 
statement that in the Byzantine Library " was the

whole of the Iliad and the Odyssey." A puzzling 
discrepancy, if one chooses to puzzle over it, exists 
between the translator's announcement that his ver- 
sion is from the second edition, Antwerp, 1602, 
and Mr. Kent's enumeration of the known editions 
as ^^ Ed. 1. De Bibliothecis Syntagma, Antwerp, 
1602 ; Ed. 2. Helmstadt, 1620 ; Ed. 3. Antwerp, 

1629." Volume six contains " The Surrender 

of the Library of Cardinal Mazarin," and " News 
from France, or A Description of the Library of 
Cardinal Mazarin," two tracts by Gabriel Naudd 
(1600-1653), librarian successively to Richelieu, 
Mazarin, and Queen Christina of Sweden. Miss 
Ruth Shepard Granniss contributes a good bio- 
graphical sketch of Naud^. The " Surrender " is 
translated by Mr. Dana and Miss Victoria Richmond ; 
the " News from France " is in the English version 
contained in volmne six of "The Harleian Mis- 
cellany." Both tracts are very short, and chiefly 
noteworthy as furnishing touching evidences of poor 
Naud^'s fond attachment to the library whose rude 
dispersion it was his sad fate to witness. He lived 
just long enough to hear of Mazarin's triumphant 
return to Paris and his resolve to re-collect his scat- 
tered volumes. 

The romance History by biography seems to be the

and adventure, ^il^ej-o" series — heroes of the na- 
tions, heroes of literature, great statesmen, great 
captains, etc. We are familiar with the titles of 
these lengthening " series," in which variety of style 
and treatment is assured by assigning the different 
volumes to difEerent writers. But in the "Heroes 
of American History " the seven biographies thus 
far issued are the work of one man, Mr. Frederick 
A. Ober, the well-known student of Spanish-Amer- 
ican history, who has made personal researches for 
the government with a view to a clearer knowledge 
of our earlier annals. The romance of discovery 
and adventure clinging to six great names has been 
admirably set forth by Mr. Ober in the volumes 
dealing with Cortes, Columbus, Pizarro, Balboa, 
De Soto, and Amerigo Vespucci ; and now he has 
reached the end of the hemisphere, if not of his 
studies, in his latest book, " Ferdinand Magellan " 
(Harper). Like Columbus and Amerigo, the great 
Portuguese explorer has left his name on the map, 
in the great waterway which he discovered and which 
remains his chief claim to immortality. In clear and 
convincing style, and with candor as well as sym- 
pathy, Mr. Ober traces the short and stormy career 
of Magellan from his birth (1480) in Traz-os- 
Montes, an obscure province of Portugal, to that 
fated 27th of Api-il, 1521, when he fell, gallantly 
fighting against overwhelming odds, on the beach 
of a small Philippine island, after a voyage which 
had lasted a year and a half. Sailing from the

Eastern seas could be reached by a direct voyage 
across the Atlantic (and perhaps that other ocean 
which Balboa had espied from Darien), instead of 
by the circuitous route around the Cape of Good 
Hope." How they moved slowly along from head- 
land to headland, making history and re-making 
geography, how one ship after another was lost, how 
the gallant and unselfish leader, Moses-like, died on 
the verge of the Promised Land, without a sight of 
the " Spiceries," the attainment of which was left 
to his less worthy lieutenants — all this is a stirring 
tale, for whose details we must refer the- reader to 
Mr, Ober's graphic pages. It constitutes one of the 
greatest chapters in that great record of the sixteenth 
century, which no American can read without a 
thrill. 

Professor Von Klenze's " Interpre- 
ifZZTiZv. t^^>°n «f Italy during the Last Two 

Centuries " (University of Chicago 
Press) is practically a monograph, a bibliography 
of travel-literature as regards the famous peninsula 
for the period named. A reflecting student is 
always surprised that out of the wreck of war and 
time anything of ancient Italy remains ; and a new 
surprise may await the reader of this book when he 
learns the very tardy recognition of what is left us. 
It seems that the appreciation of Italy, as of much 
else of value in the world, awaited the revival of 
learning and the Reformation. In fact, hardly by 
the middle of the eighteenth century had educated 
people any real conception of the culture-value of 
what every Roman town and city could still show. 
Italy was discovered as literally and quite as slowly 
as America ; not that visitors were lacking, but that 
those who did see Italy saw so very little. Even 
the most appreciative foimd only one thing at a 
time : thus, the celebrated Winckelman saw in Rome 
only a depository of the art of ancient Greece, and 
it remained for Diderot and the men of the Revolu- 
tion to appreciate Angelo and Rafael. The present 
volume is intended, further, as a contribution to a 
more exact appreciation of Goethe ; and while not 
a commentary on the Italienische Seise, it is yet 
designed to supply needed perspective to the student 
who would understand that piece of German litera- 
tm-e. Goethe was in Rome in 1786, and was a 
traveller in various parts of Italy and Sicily for 
many months. The impress of this experience 
appears in all the subsequent work of the poet, but 
the formal record of the journey to Italy did not 
appear until 1816. It would seem that Goethe 
destroyed most of his original notes, and yet, judg- 
ing from those that remain, first published in 1886, 
the '' taffebiicher " had doubtless interested men 
to-day much more even than the finished and 
studied volume which is designed to take their 
place. But Professor Von Klenze does not intend 
to tell us what Goethe saw or reported so much as 
to give an idea of the intellectual conditions, the 
tuition under which he worked. We have accord- 
ingly the bibliography of Italian travel up to Groethe's 



1907.]

_. . , President Nicholas Murrav Butler's 

inpoiaie* " True and False Democracy 

omee more. (Macmillan ) is made up of three 

addresses. — first, one with the same title as the 
book, and delivered last spring at the University- of 
California : second, a commencement address before 
the University of Michigan, 1899, on "Education 
of Public Opinion "; and, third, " Democracy and 
Education,"' delivered at the convention of the Na- 
tional Educational Association in 1896. In all 
three, stress is laid on the importance of enlightened 
liberty under a democratic form of government, and 
its antagonism to that deadJevel equality that was 
the impossible ideal of the French revolutionists, 
and that would be fatal to all progress, all happi- 
ness, and, in short, to all government. The author 
declares himself emphatically in favor of the present 
system of political parties, subject to abuse though 
that system is : and, as a necessary consequence, he 
holds the independent voter in rather slight esteem. 
In harmonj', too. with his general political leanings 
is his conviction that it is not our chief executive 
who is usurping legislative functions, but quite the 
opposite. Certain legislative abuses he censures 
littingly. especially the unwieldiness, obstructive- 
ness, and openness to corruption, that characterize 
our overgrown law-making bodies : •' for it is well- 
nigh a political axiom that large constituencies make 
independent representatives, and that small con- 
stituencies make tools and ciphers. We must not 
forget how much farther a bullet will carry than a 
few score of small shot.'' Worthy of passing notice, 
perhaps, as a typographical curiosity are the author's 
references to Gladstone the leader (with a small I) 
and to Mr. Croker the Boss ( with a large B) — 
an unintentional reversal of dignities. Throughout, 
the book insists on the necessity of liberal educa- 
tion to secure enlightened government and political 
purity — a theory of salvation by the scholar in poli- 
tics which, it must be said, has received some rather 
rude shocks in recent vears.

In " Holderness : An Aeconnt of the 
Beginnings of a New Hampshire 
in SrwEnaiand. Town ' (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). 
Dr. George Hodge* tells the story of the settlement 
of a typical little New England hill town, named 
from the Yorkshire Holderness, and pleasantly 
situated on Squam Lake, not far from Plymouth, 
in Grafton County. It was under a charter from 
Gov. Benning Wentworth. in 1761, that the little 
community began its corporate existence. Of the 
sixtj--one grantees named on the back of the charter. 
Samuel Livermore, the " Squire," became the lar- 
gest land-owner and the most important personage 



of Holderness, and was almost the only one whose 
name ever got beyond the borders of the state. 
The town's foremost citizen in his lifetime, at his 
death he left to it a memory that is sdU its best 
posseaBion. "At his mansion on the bluff," sajs 
the historian, •' he dispensed a generous hospitality, 
practising the fine but difficult virtue set forth in 
the text which is inscribed on the tombstone of his 
son, beside the old man. • Give alms of thy goods, 
and never turn thy face from any poor man.' On 
his kitchen table there was always a great iron 
liasket and a huge pottery pitcher, the basket filled 
with corn-and-rye bread, and the pitcher with cider, 
free to all passers-by." Another interesting charter 
member of this Yankee oommnnity was Colonel 
Hercnles Mooney, who, after serving in both the 
French and Indian War and the Revolution, laid 
aside the sword for the ferrule, and resumed his 
peaceful calling of schoolmaster. From his place 
behind the teacher's desk this long and lank, 
bronzied and scarred veteran of two wars most have 
commanded the ready respect and prompt obedience 
of his young disciples. Dr. Hodges concludes his 
narrative with the death of Robert Fowle, the first 
parson of Holderness, in 1847. Maps, illustrations, 
and appended notes make the little book as complete 
le.

Breeding" (Open Court Publishing Co., Chicago). 
The origin and significance of specific forms is still 
one of the most fascinating subjects with which 
naturalists may be concerned. De Vries's position 
in the argument, thanks to his own lectures in this 
country and to the writings of his friends and oppo- 
nents everywhere, b now pretty well understood. 
He urges that species originate in what the gar- 
deners call " sports." sudden and unexplained de- 
partnres from the habitual type. In this De Vries 
would controvert the Darwinian view that species 
result from very slow and gradual minute changes 
responsive to changing environment. For the sup- 
jx>rt of his theory, Darwin made constant appeal to 
the experience of breeders, especially of cattle and 
birds ; although as a botanist he himself made a 
great many very interesting experiments in breed- 
ing jdants. De V^ries. in support of his contention, 
cites not only his own experience, but is able to 
bring into the field the results offered by experiment 
stations and investigators who have worked since 
Darwin, in all parts of the world. The book is, 
accordingly, a summary of what has been achieved 
by such men as Nilsson in Sweden, Burbank in 
California, and others, especially as the results 
obtained by these men bear upon the que^on of 
species derivation. De Vries, of course, finds in aU 
the more recent results obtained by gardeners and 
experimenters confirmation of his own theory,

In Helen Abbott Michael's " Studies

Literary Papers (Riverside Press) 
we have the record of a simple but strenuously 
active life. Born in 1857 and dying in 1904, Mrs. 
Michael has left us records of investigation not only 
surprising in bulk, but, as Dr. Wiley, the govern- 
ment chemist, says, "prominent in the annals of 
American chemistry." For Mrs. Micliael was a 
chemist, and long before her marriage Helen Abbott 
was known to the learned societies of this country 
and of the world as an investigator of wonderful 
originality, ability, and skill. Her work lay in the 
domain of organic chemistry, especially the chem- 
istry of plant products ; and it was her contention 
that the true taxonomy of vegetable forms lay 
revealed in their attainments in the construction of 
chemical compounds. This is not the place to enter 
upon extended criticism either of Mrs. Michael's 
theories or her work ; suffice it to say that she has 
done more than any other woman in the United 
States to promote research in this particular field, 
and must be reckoned with hereafter by all, in all 
lands, who attempt work in the subtle chemistry of 
plants. Withal, Mrs. Michael appears to have been 
a woman of charming personality, possessed of all 
the graces of her sex, and fortunate in an acquain- 
tance world-wide in its extent. The volume contains 
an extended biographical sketch ; an introduction to 
Mrs. Michael's work in chemistry, by Dr. Wiley ; 
sixteen papers on organic chemistry, four of them 
in German ; and four literary papers which discuss 
such themes as " Science and Philosophy in Art," 
"The Drama in Relation to Truth," Whitman, 
Browning, etc. A photogravure porti-ait forms the

this famous Frenchwoman in his book entitled 
" Madame R^camier and Her Friends " (Scribner). 
Virtuous, sympathetic, and tactful, she seems to have 
been able to fill her salon with notable personages 
of widely varied schools and opinions, and of all 
grades of social rank. Soldiers and dandies of the 
Empire, statesmen and diplomats of the Restoration,

observed, her career runs like a fine silver thread 
through the web of history and is inseparable from it, 
the reader of her biogi-aphy receives, in a desultory 
way, some vivid pictures of the times. Were this 
not true, Mr. Williams might be said to lack an 
excuse for his work, since Madame R^camier had 
no creative ability and her talent was merely social. 
But granting the raison d'etre of the biography, it 
may be said that the author has conscientiously 
studied the life of his heroine, together with those 
of her friends as they affected hers, and presents the 
results in a pleasant, easy manner, which makes the 
book an entertaining one.

In these letters, Mr. Ostwald discusses the methods 

in the technique of painting ;• the various processes, 

their advantages and limitations. He makes a 

definite plea for a knowledge of science in art, and 

insists that unconscious inspiration must gfive way 

to conscious understanding of the processes and 

methods of work. The art student will find in these 

letters much food for reflection, particularly in the 

treatment of media, their optical characteristics and 

results. The general reader, perhaps, unable to cope 

with Mr. Ostwald's theories, wUl nevertheless learn 

from the book many interesting facts concerning the 

art of painting. By means of concise explanations, 

the technical terms necessary to the subject-matter

Mr. Beerbohm Tree, Sir Charles Windham, Mr. W. S.

The late Frederick Eli Dewhurst was a Congrega- 
tional minister who impressed all who came to know 
him with his spiritual earnestness and intellectual sin- 
cerity. He was not a popular preacher, for he scorned 
the sensational methods and rhetorical artifices by which 
preachers become popular, but he satisfied to a rare 
degree the wants of those who go to church for ethical 
and intellectual sustenance. The last years of his 
ministzy were spent in a church near the University of 
Chicago, and it is peculiarly appropriate that the Press 
of that University should issue a volume of his sermons. 
" The Investment of Truth " is the title of the volume, 
which includes sixteen sermons, written during the last 
two years of Mr. Dewhurst's life. They are provided 
with a sympathetic introduction by Ptotesam Albion 
W. Small. 

County Berks, in England, is interesting as having for 
its northern boundary- the upper waters of the Thames 
for a hundred miles of its course, and containing within 
its borders Windsor and its famous castle. It has 
further interest in having been the home of " Fair 
Rosamond " in the twelfth cemur>~ and of Amy Rt^wnrt 
in the axteenth. It has also within its bordos the 
famous White Horse Hill, the puzzle of antiquaries, 
besides the average picturesque bits of English scenery ; 
and it is otherwise rich in material for gossip and com- 
ment, such as is in demand for the volumes of the 
" Highways and Byways Series " (Macmillan). Never- 
theless the volume demands of its author a good deal of 
padding and chatting about inconsequential things, to 
bring it up to the standard size set for that series of 
topographical books. The author, Mr. James Edmund 
Vmcent, is a newspaper correspondent, who has sought 
the highways and byways of his adc^>ted county, as he 



calls it, on a bicycle, and with good resnits. Hb pen 
rtms on and fills out his stint of pag<es, and the scenes 
are well chosen for illustration by Mr. Frederick L. 
Grigg with remarkable sneeess as to pictaresqne effeete; 
so that the book, while perhaps not the most entertain- 
ing of the series in which it belongs, is certainly not the 
least so.

Scribner are the publishers. 

A new edition of John Fiske's " Essays Historical and 
Literary " (two vohmies in one) is published by the

Governor Hutchinson, Chai'les Lee, Hamilton, Jefferson, 
Madison, Jackson, Harrison, and Webster; among the 
subjects dealt with in the second volume are Milton, 
Connecticut and the Constitution, the Boston Tea-Party, 
Huxley, Spencer, and Tyndall. 

« John Bull's Other Island," « Major Barbara," and 
" How He Lied to Her Husband " are included ui a new 
volume of Mr. Bernard Shaw's plays just published by 
the Messrs. Brentano. The first play is provided with 
a " Preface for Politicians " and the thii-d with a chapter 
of " First Aid to Critics." Mr. Shaw's prefaces are 
almost as good fim as his dramas, a fact which his 
readers hai-dly need to be told. 

Miss Agnes Tobin's translations from Petrarch have 
attracted the favorable attention of many critics. To 
the two small collections previously published, she now 
adds a third one, much larger, which is entitled " On 
the Death of Madomia Laura," and comes from the press 
of Mr. William Heinemann. It makes a beautifully- 
printed book of beautiful verse. Messrs. Paul Elder & 
Co. are the American agents for its sale. 

The "Rivista di Scienza" is a new international 
quarterly published at Bologna, with Messrs. Williams 
& Norgate for its London agents. It is mider the 
editorship of an Italian Comitate di Direzione, but its 
pages are open to contributions ui the fom' cliief lan- 
guages of cultiu-e. The initial number contains eight 
leading papers, three in Italian, two in French, two in 
German, and one in English. The appended reviews are 
also of a polyglot character. An extensive pi-ogramme 
of some fourscore papers already arranged for gives 
evidence of the weighty nature of this important new 
publication. They bear the names of the most distin- 
guished specialists now living.

LIST OF NEW BOOK^ 70 



LITEBATURE IX OFFICE. 

The city of San Francisco has honored both 
literature and itself by the appointment of Dr. 
Edward Rol>e.son Taylor to the office of the 
mayoralty'. There is no reason (despite the 
jx)i)ular prejutlice to the contrary) why a good 
}X)et shoidd not make a good administrator, and 
we exjject that Dr. Taylor will apply to his new 
( iWc ta.sk the same nicety of discriminating judg- 
ment that he has applied to his translation of 
Here<lia. The literary mayor is not altogether 
a noveltj' in our public life, since Mr. Brand 
\\Tiitlock offers us another example in Toledo, 
and even the mayor of New York is the author 
of a highly ci-etlitable monograph upon Venetian 
history-. Had it not been for the lamentable 
defeat of Mr. John Kendrick Bangs, when he 
sought the votes of the unappreciative citizens 
of Yonkers a few yeai"S ago, another shining 
name might have been added to our list. The 
faculties of the humorist ai-e no less likely than 
those of the poet to find fitting exercise in the 
control of civic affairs. The legislative fimc- 
tion quite frequently develojjs humorists ; why 
.shoultl we not now and then choose for its per- 
foi-mance a jester whose quality is already 
known to the public"? As for the novelist, is 
he not, by the very nature of his calling, an 
authority upon political and social conditioiLS, 
an exposer of the very evils that law-makers 
have it for theii- duty to destroy ? It was by 
his title of novelist that Mr. Rwth Tarkington 
made his way into the legislative councils of 
his native Indiana. When Mr. Winston 
Churclull got into the legislature of New 
Hamjjshire, did not the corruptionists shake 
in their boots, and the representatives of the 
railroad monopoly turn their thoughts toward 
the .subject of cyclone-cellars'? By all means 
let us have humorists and novelists in greater 
numbei-s — and poets too — among our i-epre- 
sentatives at the state capitals. 

There is no public office to which literature 
may not climb in an age which has chosen a man 
of lettei-s to be the President of the Unitetl 
States. We do not imagine that " The Winning 
of the West '" alone would have won for Mr. 
Roosevelt the distinction of the chief magistracy, 
but there is a legitimate source of gratitication 



62 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



in the fact that the most exalted office in the 
land is filled by a man who has an honorable 
position among American historians and essay- 
ists. There is hardly another example in our 
history of a President having lit^iury distinction 
apart from his office, although something might 
be said on this score for Jefferson and for John 
Quincy Adams. Some of our Presidents have 
had their " works " posthumously published in 
imposing sets of volumes, but the voliunes be- 
long, for the most pai"t, in Lambs category of 
books that are not books. 

In the past, the rule of our public life seems 
to have been that a few foreign legations and 
consulates might properly be awarded to gentle- 
men of the literary profession, although even 
this largess has been rather grudgingly doled 
out. It has never been altogether true to say 

with the satirist that 

" We 're oiJy kuowii 
In courts where Adauis trtxl and Franklin shone, 
By mute Ambassadors who grandly scorn to 
Maim any language save the one they 're born to," 

for the early appointments of Joel Barlow as 
minister to France and Irving as minister to 
Spaui established a literary tradition in the 
diplomatic service which has been occasionally 
observed ever since. The names of Motley and 
Taylor and Lowell occui- at once to the mind 
as among the most conspicuous that have ever 
jitlomed that service, while mention of the con- 
sular service as promptly suggests Hawthorne, 
Howells, Harte, and a host of others. 

The briUiant success of our men of letters in 
these important public positions abroad might 
projjerly have suggested similar experiments at 
home. It has done so in occasional instances, 
although we cannot at the moment recall either 
a postmaster-poet or an excise-essayist. Walt 
Whitman, it will be remembered, occupied a 
petty government office until some one discov- 
ered that he was a poet, whereupon he was 
summarily dismissed I The late John Hay as 
Secretary of State offers our best recent example 
of a man of lettei-s in high official station, but 
it was rumored tliat the years of his officialdom 
brought him to the opinion that his most dis- 
tinctive litei-ary perfoi-mances had been sins of 
his youth for which he hoped to be forgiven. 

Litei-atiu'C appears to receive somewhat more 
of public recognition (although none too much) 
in England than it does in the United States. 
We remember that Burns and Wordsworth 
were excise officers, and we take a certain pride 
in the fact that a poet and a diumatic critic, 
Mr. Dobson and Mr. Walkley, ai-e, respectively, 
efficient public public servants in the Board of 



Tratle and the Post-Office Department. A mere 
essayist, Mr. Birrell, is next to the Prime Min- 
ister the most conspicuous figure in the present 
Government, while the leader of the opixjsition, 
Mr. Balfour, is a gi-aceful, if not a profound, 
metaphysician. Imagination balks at the effort 
to figure our own party leaders as either essay- 
ists or metajjhysicians. We do occasionally 
discover men of letters strayed by accident into 
the halls of Congress, — 

" Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto," — 
but we do not find that generous sprinklmg of 
them that we observe in the avei-age British 
Parliament. Moreover, England has in the 
laureateship one public post to which poets alone 
are eligible, which fact is clearly an official 
feather in the cap of literature. 

Even royalty sometimes gi-aces litei-ature, not 
merely with patronage, but with actual per- 
formance. Jidius Cffisar was a man of letters 
(as schoolboys know), and a very great man of 
letters in the opinion of so high an authority 
as Signor Fen-ero. Nero was not the poet he 
thought himself, but he held his art in projjer 
esteem. All men of English race take pride ui 
the litei-ary activities of Alfred the Great. In 
our own day, the King of Sweden and the Queen 
of Roumania are authors who woidd be taken 
seriously even if they did not occupy tlu-ones, 
while the German Emperor, just because he 
occupies one, is taken seriously enough by his 
entourage when he drops into jroeti-y. Having 
thus in our progress reached the pinnacle of 
rank, any further illustrations of literature in 
office would have the effect of an anti-climax, for 
which i-eason it seems best tliat no more be said. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A FACTITIOUS DEMAND FOR AN AUTHOR's WORKS 

is always created when that author marries, dies, 
divorces his wife or is liimself divorced by her, or 
otherwise does or says sometliing that gets his name 
into the newspapers. " We are obliged," says one 
of the assistants in a large public library, '• to watch 
the daily papei-s studiously in order to keep prepared 
for the demand for certain books and the works of 
cei'tain authors. Whenever a prominent author dies, 
gets married, or figures prominently in the news- 
papers in any way, there is sure to follow within a 
day or two a greatly increased demand for his books. 
The same is true when a novel is dramatized." Mr. 
Bryce's " American Commonw^ealth " has of late 
enjoyed a renewed vogue — or, at least, the first 
volume has ; for it is surprising ( no, not surprising, 
human nature being what it is) how many pei-sons 
yield to this sudden impulse to read an author, but

ncTer get beyond a volume or two. Thus all our 
public libraries show mnltitades of rebound and 
re-rebound first volumes, a lesser number of shabby 
second volumes, and a prett}* uniform display of 
third and subsequent volumes of increasing imma«- 
nlateness as we approach the end of the set. This 
state of things tells of a culture far other than that 
which develops steadily and silently from an inner 
principle, working itself out more and more into a 
self-poised and symmetrical whole. There are two 
classes of readers that are notably free from the 
outside influences above mentioned : they are the 
staid and sensible older readers, and the ever- 
conservative juvenile frequenters of the library, to 
whom *• Robinson Crusoe " is as delightful as it was 
to their great-great-grandfathers. Theirs is the 
kingdom of literature, in its best sense.

Spadt's litekakt awakexxxg is becoming a 
subject of frequent approving comment. A scholarly 
writer in La Revue ( Paris ) says that at last Spanish 
authors •• have placed themselves in contact with the 
vibrant and sincere soul of the multitude." They 
have '■• transformed their sentiments, their processes, 
their verj- vocabularies, in such manner that it is not 
difBcnlt to predict the flowering of a vigorous and 
original art worthy of Spain's historic greatness. 
. . . The novel has been ennobled and developed 
to the point of becoming the very opposite of what 
it had been at the close of the nineteenth century. 
... In the hands of the new-comers it gains vigor 
in that it appears to emanate from the verj- soul 
of the j>eople. . . . Two traits in particular charac- 
terize the work of this great modem group : the 
perfecting of style, formerly diicoixlant and riotous, 
and the successful effort to escape from those gran- 
diloquent and irregular formulas which made the 
reading of earlier novels tedious." And thus, we 
are assured, •• the way is opened for the triumph of 
sincerity and the final overthrow of rhetoric" In 
the other branches of literature also. es]>ecially in 
poetrj-, the drama, and criticism, the same demo- 
cratic tendencies are asserting themselves. Fur- 
thermore, a political transformation to match the 
literary revolution is confidently predicted. It does 
reallj- seem as if drowsy old Spain, with her young 
king, her new queen, her infant crown-prince, her 
lately achieved freedom from colonial dogs, and her 
newly-hatched brood of singing birds, were respond- 
ing to the quickening influences of modern life.

A QtrEKT FOK THE vuLL SEASOX, and one which 
many an idle dreamer has already asked, is this : 
Can it be that the ancients lived in a present that 
was as real and as matter-of-fact to them as our 
present is to us ? Yes, we venture to answer, and 
a good deal more so — excepting, perhaps, the era of 
the Renaissance and the brave days of Elizabethan 
voyaging and discovery. We live in an age of 
rapidl)- increasing wonders that would have driven 
the hungriest novelty-seeker of Athens dizzy with 
amazement A converse query, not so often heard. 



is this: Will our very real and very modem pre- 
sent ever take on the ancient aspect and clothe 
itself in the vague mists that attach to the period of 
Rameses the Great ? To this also we reply with an 
emphatae yes. With things material and spiritual 
taking new shapes and gaining new meanings every 
day. how can the men and women of the sisrtieth 
century fail to regard the reality of our existence 
with the same incredulity that fills us on contem- 
platii^, for example, the ruins of Nineveh or 
Thebes? This thought may make the novmess of 
this year of grace 1907 turn pale and wan : but to 
the oppression of midsummer heat it brings a sooth- 
ing sense of the transitoriness of all tilings, even 
of mosquitoes, hand-organs, automobfles, and other 
nuisances. . ... 

A TRULY ENCTCLOPJKDIC EKCTCLOP.KDIA, if one 

may judge by its size, is the famous Chinese Ency- 
clopaedia prepared by Chinese scholars nearly two 
centuries ago, issued in 5020 volumes (limited to 
ICK) sets), and known to the Western world chiefly 
through the highly prized copy in the British Mu- 
seum. Renewed attention is at this time called to 
the mammoth Chinese work because of the retire- 
ment of Sir Robert Douglass from the custodian- 
ship of Oriental printed hooks and manuscripts in 
the Museum. It was through his efforts, about 
fifteen years ago, that a set of the ponderous ency- 
clopedia was secured. A certain Chinese prince 
was pinched for ready cash, and offered his copy of 
the work in question for sale. But as he would not 
part with it to a foreigner, some little scheming was 
necessary to obtain it for England. Through the 
agency of a discreet middleman the 5020 volumes 
were safely delivered, in fifteen cartloads, at the 
door of the British Legation, and in due time 
forwarded to London. The work, besides being a 
compendium of all Chinese knowledge at its date 
of pnUieation, is adorned with many quaint illustra- 
tions. Sir Robert, its erstwhile guardian, is accounted 
an authority on things Chinese, and his retirement 
will be regretted. ... 

A POVEETT-STEICKEN' CREATOK OF UtAGIX ART 

WEALTH is somewhat piathetically presented to our 
view In the person of that prolific producer of splen-

as "Ouida.'" After luxuriating, with her tens of 
thousands of readers, in all the elegant superfluities 
that money can buy (in the pages of a novel), tlie 
unfortunate lady is said now to be hardly able to 
command the bare necessities. She who seemed 
born to live in princely palaces and to dispense 
hospitali^ with queenly hand, is reported to have 
fallen into a state of dej)endence on her own serv- 
ants, a condition from which, however, she was 
fortunately rescued by a pension from the British 
government. The pecuniary relief was small, but, 
whatever its amount, there will be satisfaction felt 
that the contributor to the pleasure — we even ven- 
ture to say, the innocent pleasure — of so many of 
her ooimtiywomen, and of her countrjiuen in smaller

numbers, has at least been freed from the g^im dread 
of starvation. Well would it have been for this 
woman, so generously endowed with creative imagi- 
nation, could she have received also from some kind 
fairy a slight intermixture of conservative prudence 
among the gifts bestowed on her at birth. Surely, 
a little tlirift in her days of prosperity would have 
safeguarded her from her present straits.

Literary events in Tokyo receive no promi- 
nent mention in our newspapei-s, but from late 
Japanese journals we are pleased to learn that inter- 
est in the latest European and American literature 
is keen among the educated classes. Premier 
Saionji has been giving dinners to novelists, poets, 
and other writers, and there seems to have been 
much good talk at these gatherings on books and 
authors of other countries besides Japan. A char- 
acteristic feature of the banquets was the impromptu 
writing of sentiments, verses, or even plain signa- 
tures, on " spotless silk," as souvenirs of the occa- 
sion. The applause elicited by some of these 
extemporaneous efforts appears to us, it must be 
confessed, a little excessive. For example, we read 
that " among others, Rohan won the praise of all 
by writing in his maidy caligi-aphy [a Japanese 
verse, thus translated] : ' On the Musashi plain 
vegetation gtows free in its varied beauty.' " But 
the charm of poetry is untranslatable, and we nmst, 
in our ignorance of Japanese, take the rare beauty 
of these specimens on trust. Among English and 
American books advertised by Tokyo booksellers are 
to be noted Leslie Stephen's " Agnostic's Apology " 
and Dr. WUliam James's " Varieties of Religious 
Experience." Free-thought is nowhere more at 

home than in Japan. 

• « • 

A WAVE OF LITERARY PlTRITANISM, or Something 
like it, appears to be sweeping over England and 
engidfing her educational authorities. Kingsley's 
" Westward Ho I " has been blacklisted at Tilbury, 
and the London Education Committee has declared 
" Mary Barton " unfit for juvenile reading. Mrs. 
GaskeU, it is alleged, is guilty of admitting to her 
book sundry disquieting " references to immoral 
doings " ; and the descriptions of riots in Lanca- 
shire would *' rdnd the hearts of young children." 
Children must, no one would dispute, sooner or 
later learn to distinguish between good and evil ; 
but the method of training here adopted cannot but 
suggest the inadequate natatory drill of the girl 
immortalized in nursery rhyme. The boys and girls 
of Britain will become objects of pity when Marryat 
and Stevenson and perhaps even Miss Yonge and 
Mrs. Marshall are put under lock and key, and the 
most exciting literature allowed is furnished by the 
" Bessie Books." ... 

A LIBRARY REPORT ON A NEW PLAN is that pre- 
pared by Mr. John Cotton Dana, librarian of the 
Newark (N. J. ) Public Library. Its arrangement 
of topics is alphabetical, with occasional cross- 
references. This is a time-saving device, and though 



the dictionary plan may have been used by other 
librarians, this is the fii-st instance we have noticed 
of its employment in this connection. The Newark 
library occupies a line new building — that is, new 
six years ago — and under Mr. Dana's headship it 
is doing good work in all its many departments. It 
maintains police-station and post-ofiice libraries, sends 
out to otlier cities and towns a noteworthy book- 
binding exhibit, opens its rooms for the meetings of 
ninety-one literary, educational, charitable and other 
organizations, gives lessons on the use of its facilities, 
circulates annually a number of books nearly equal 
to twice the population of the city, issues more than 
two hundred mimeograph bulletins and lists to aid 
readers, and engages in many other praiseworthy 
enterprises. Evidently the new librarian and the 
new building have given a fresh impetus to library 
activity in Newark. ... 

A Byron Memorial in Westminster Abbey 
is among the possibilities of the near future. Mr. 
Charles Rathbone Law, the historian, is reported as 
actively interested in the matter ; and he must have 
a considerable following in all English-speaking 
lands. It appears that when Byron died. Dean 
Ireland refused to let his remains be buried in the 
Abbey; and it has been plausibly conjectured that 
his motives were the same as those suggested by 
Henley when he wrote : " Two obvious reasons why 
Byron has long been a prophet more honored abroad 
than at home are his life and his works." But there 
are many monuments in Westminster Abbey erected 
to genius rather than virtue, and some bear testi- 
mony to neither. There are even kings of England 
reposing beneath its pavement who might find it 
hard to show cause why they should not have been 
excluded from the sacred precincts. 
... 

Public libraries in. the South are almost as 
rare as violets in October. Georgia, one of the least 
backward of Southern States in library progress, has 
only eight free public libraries that occupy their own 
buildings, with three more in process of construction. 
This information is found in a '• Handbook of the 
Libraries of the State," issued by the Carnegie 
Library of Atlanta. It contains also an account 
of the State Library Association, the library laws 
of Georgia, the Georgia Library Commission, and 
an illustrated summary of public libraries in the 
State. Our great South, with its dearth of libraries, 
ought to make Mr. Carnegie take heart of grace : 
there is stUl hope that he need not die disgracefully 
rich, so numerous are the unlibraried cities and 
villages awaiting the bestowal of his bounty. 
... 

IMONUMENTAL NEGLECT OF DiCKENS is perhaps 

the appropriate phrase for the astonishing lack of 
that sort of visible memorial of the great novelist 
which one would have most confidently looked for 
in London. But though thirty-five years have passed 
since he died, no bust to perpetuate his memory has 
until now been on view in any public spot in the 
city. A bust by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald has 'just

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



EABLY ENGLISH DRAMA GIVKX BY AMERICAX 

STUDEXTS. 

(To the Editor of Th« Diai.) 

In a paragraph concerning the presentation of the 
earlier English drama by undergraduates of American 
colleges, in a recent issue of The Diai. (June 16, 1907), 
I find two errors that are worth correcting. The re- 
cent Princeton production of Marlowe's " Dr. Faostos " 
was antedated by a production at Brown Univenity, 
April 23, 19l^4. Udall's " Roister Doister " has never 
been given at Harvard, but was presented this season 
in Boston by students of the Emerson College of Ora- 
tory. Other revivals of " Roister Doister " are: Tufts 
College, June 6, 180.5 (I think its first presentation in 
.\inerica); Bryn Mawr, Nov. 8, 1895; Butler College, 
Indianapolis, 1896; Yale University, May 2, 1900; the 
University of Vermont, the spring of 1900; and the 
Roxbury (Mass.) High School, April 1,3 and 16, 1904. 

An interesting chapter is yet to be written, containing 
a full account of American academic representation of 
Shakespeare's predecessors and contemporaries. Mean- 
while, perhaps The Di.\i. has room for a few desultory 
data on the subject. In the order of time, the following 
college presentations have been made. Harvard, March 
20, 1895, gave Ben Jonson's " Silent Woman," the east 
acceptably filled by students from the American Acad- 
emy of Dramatie Arts, New York City. The interior 
of the Swan Theatre was faithfully reproduced, and 
twenty-two Harvard undergraduates gave vivid illustra- 
tion of the customs of Shakespeare's time. The Delta 
Upsilon Society of Harvard presented Dekker's " Shoe- 
maker's Holiday," .\pril 28, 29, 30, 1898, and has been 
accustomed to give annually an older English play — the 
last (1907) being Beaumont and Fletclier's " Knight of 
the Burning Pestle." These performances are, in acting 
and in management, in care of the undergraduates. 
Tufts gave the "First Pageant of the Shepherds" 
(Towneley series), Feb. 27, 1900. A little later the 
" Second Pageant of the Shepherds " was played by 
students of Y'ale, in conjunction with a dramatized 
version of Chaucer's « Pardoner's Tale." The year 1901 



saw the " Shoemaker's Holiday " again, at Butler Col- 
lege, Indiana ; an out-of-door " As You Like It," June 
14 and 15, at the University of Chicago; and Milton's 
" Comus," June 4 and 5, at Tufts. Brown University 
gave a series of performances in 1904, including, be- 
sides the " Faustus " already mentioned, the Chester 
version of " Noah's Flood," " The Slaughter of the 
Innocents," " The Revesby Sword Play," a scene from 
the Robin Hood plays, and John Redford's morality, 
" Wyt and Science." 

This hasty enumeration makes no mention of 
Wellesley's marked activity, through the Bam Swal- 
lows and the Shakespeare Society, in bringing to life 
half-forgotten plays. Shakes[>eare's romantic and fairy 
comedies, such as " Midsummer Xight's Dream " and 
•• The Tempest," have more than once been plaved out- 
of-doors, with brilliant light and costume effects ; " The 
Knight of the Burning Pestle " and Ben Jonson's " Sad 
Shepherd " have delighted well-informed audiences. 
Anyone who has witnessed one or more of those charm- 
ing plays upon the green at Wellesley has a memory of 
enchantment. Tufts vied with Wellesley in an open- 
air performance of Thomas Dekker's " Old Fortunatus," 
June 1, 2, and 4, 1906, with thirty-five speaking parts, 
and fifty-six mutes, including Queen Elizabeth herself 
before whom the play was presented. The costumes, 
music, and dancing were c<HTect as well as impressive.

THE ORIGIN OF -GRAFT." 
(To the Editor of Thk Dial.) 

In this word, which has rushed into extraordinarv 
popularity and common use within the last two or three 
years, so that it can hardly be called any longer mere 
slan^ we have another example of the degradation of 
a oaee honorable word. One of Dean Treiieh's p<^u]ar 
books on the English language discusses such changes 
with several examples. Such are " knave " and " churl," 
the first of which meant boy, then servant, at last rogue ; 
the second meant man, especially a strong man, and 
next a rude man, as one who presumes on bjs strength. 

Now if anyone has puzzled himself in tiying to con- 
nect this new word of opprobriiun with the horticultural 
operation whereby a twig is inserted into a tree to win 
a new source of life, let him understand that he is look- 
ing in the wrong direction. Forty or fifty years ago, 
"graft," which has succeeded the less euphonious 
"boodle," meant one's regular occupation or bosiness. 
See Hotten's Slang Dictionary, which gives no other 
meaning (date about 1865). When one EngUsh work- 
man asked another, " What is your graft ? " he imputed 
uo dishonor. The answer involved the name of a trade: 
" I 'm a mason," or " I 'm a tanner." 

In fact, it was a slight mispronunciation of the word 
craft, familiar to readers of the New Testament in the 
nineteenth chapter of Acts, in the story of the tumult 
at Epbesus. Demetrius the silversmith said, " Bv this 
craft we have our wealth . . . this our craft is in dan- 
ger." The Revised Version substitutes the words 
" business " and " trade." While the words " handi- 
craft " and " craftsman " have retained their dignity, 
•• crafty " has passed from its orig^inal meaning, skilful, 
into the disgrace of tricky, deceitful. "Craft" is 
dropping out of use ; hence the revisers used those other 
words, and its derivative " graft " is sorely degraded.

AND Diplomat.* 



If for convenience' sake, and %vitli the sanc- 
tion of good authority, we let the words " eight- 
eenth century " denote the period between the 
last English and the first French revolution 
(1688-1789), we shall find the life of not the 
least representative eighteenth-century English- 
man falling entirely within that term, with six 
years' margin at one end and sixteen at the 
other. Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth Earl 
of Chesterfield, believed the end and aim of 
our mortal existence to be the repression of 
spontaneities and the assiduous cultivation of 
elegant artificialities. His excessive regard for 
externals, and his cynical disbelief in anything 
genuine behind the mask, helped to make his 
the " age of prose, of lying, of sham, the 
fraudulent-bankrupt century," that Carlyle so 
mercilessly railed at, at the same time that he 
chose not a few of his heroes — his Friedrich, 
his Goethe and Schiller, his Johnson and his 
Burns — from the middle and end of that era 
of corruption and cant. 

Mr. W. H. Craig announces, in a brief 
preface to his " Life of Lord Chesterfield,'' the 
motive that has prompted him to add to the 
" already over-crowded list of writings " on the 
courtly Earl. He believes that hitherto enough, 
and more than enough, attention has been 
given " to his private life and correspondence, 
and to his wit, his savoir /aire, his peculiar 
system of practical ethics, his sallies into the 
field of literature, his theory of the ' Graces,' 
and his various questionable proclivities "; but 
that too little has been devoted " to the con- 
sideration of those rarer and higher qualities 
which distinguished him as a valuable public 
servant to whose ability, zeal, energy, political 
foresight, incorruptibility, and dexterity En- 
gland is more indebted than she appears to 
recognize at present." Therefore he avoids 
dwelling on the former and more familiar attri- 
butes, and seeks to emphasize the latter. The 
i-ecord of Lord Chesterfield's public services is 
open to all ; but how far they were disinterested 
services, and how far prompted by personal and 
selfish motives, is matter for debate. His 
apologist, if one may so designate his latest 
biographer, is temperate and judicious in tone, 
and has presented what appears to be a not too

flattering picture of the man. A glimpse of 
Chesterfield in a role that well suited him is 
afforded in the following passage descriptive of 
his ambassadorial life at The Hague ; the para- 
graph furnishes also a fair sample of the writer's 
impartial treatment of his theme. 

" His new vocation was pleasant to a man of his 
temperament, who, though he affected to be ' simph' a 
man of pleasure,' was m reality fond of work and 
desirous of pleasing others. ... A remarkable instance 
of his desii'e to conciliate those whose opinions might 
differ ever so widely from his own, is afforded by hLs 
account of an incident, by which, as he remarks, ' I have 
acquired some degree of reputation.' ' You must know,' 
he proceeds [in a letter to Lady Suffolk], 'that last 
Sunday I treated the people here with an English 
cliristening in my chapel of a Black-a-moor boy that I 
have, liaving had him first instructed fully in the Chris- 
tian faith by my chaplain, and examined by myself. 
The behaviour of the young Cliristian was decent and 
exemplary, and he renounced his likeness with great 
devotion, to the infinite edification of a very numerous 
audience of both sexes.' And then follows the inevitable 
mocking tag, ' Though I have by these means got the 
reputation of a very good Christian, yet the more thrifty 
and frugal people here call my parts and economy a 
good deal in question for having put it out of my power 
ever to sell him.' That he was an assiduous man of 
business is evident from the references we meet with 
in his correspondence with the Secretaries of State at 
home, and more especially from Lord Townshend's 
repeated tributes to his zeal and activity. His store of 
energy was inexliaustible. Before he left England it 
expended itself chiefly on society; but when he was 
given the chance of employing it more usefully, no man 
could devote hmiself with a keener z&st to the work 
before him." 

Lord Chesterfield's gi-eatest public service was 
the introtluction of the reformed or Gregorian 
calendar into England, after the accumulated 
error of the Jidian calendar, then in use, had 
amounted to eleven days. The English year, 
too, had liitherto begim on the 25th of March, 
while all other European countries, except 
Russia and Sweden, began their }-ear with the 
first of January, Gregorian reckoning. Of 
course the popular resistance to a change — 
to the acceptance of a calendar amended by a 
Pope of Rome — was gi-eat : but Chesterfield's 
eloquence carried Parliament with him, and 
the new order went into effect in 1752. Nor 
does the chief author of the reform appear to 
have incurred the people's ill-will, though they 
were bitter against Lord Macclesfield and Dr. 
Bradley, the Astronomer Royal, his efficient 
helpers in the good cause. This event in 
Chesterfield's life is worthy of especial note, 
since his name is so seldom associated with the 
reform of our calendar.

precepts so la^^shly scattereJ through his letters 
to his son, is all in the temper of an impartial 
biographer. For instance, he writes : 

" It is not the object of these pages to whitewash 
Chesterfield. He was not a ' good man ' in the conven- 
tioual sense of the term, but one of those who assign to 
esi)ediency that position which is the right of conscience; 
and readers mast be left to decide how far, considering 
the time in which he Uved and the special object he had 
in view, he was justified in laving down such a code of 
morals as the Laten contain for the guidance of his son. 
When we come to discuss his precepts as to manners 
and deportment, we find ourselves upon firmer ground, 
though, even here, the march of time has played havoc 
with much of his wisdom. Dr. Johnson averred that, 
' leaving out the immoralitj-, the Letters might be made 
a very pretty book which should be put into the hands 
of every young gentleman; ' and to a certain extent this 
is true, though young gentlemen of the present day 
would be slow, and very justly, to accept his lordship's 
code of manners. Our youths have outgrown the pM- 
maUreAsta which was the distinguishing characteristic 
of an elegant young gentleman of Chesterfield's day, 
and any youth formed upon that model would now be 
regarded as a milksop and a prig. Still the Letter:: 
abound with invaluable rules for ctmduct which, though 
every well-brought-up lad knows them perfectly well, 
he will be nothing the worse for being reminded of."' 

There are manj' acts in Chesterfield's life 
that became him less than his manner of leaving 
it. In ac-conlanee with instructions contained 
in his last will and testament — " Satiated with 
the pompous follies of this life of which I have 
had an uncommon share^ I would have no 
posthumous ones displayed at my funeral, and 
therefore desire to be buried in the next biu-ying- 
place to the place where I shall die, and limit 
the whole expenses of my funeral to £100 " — 
he was buried in Grosvenor Chapel, South 
AucUey Street. London ; but his friends after- 
ward so far disregarded his djTng washes as to 
remove his body to the family burying-place at 
Shelford. 

The book is written in an agreeable narrative 
style that shows marks of scholarly care, 
although a slight lack of system betrays itself 
in some few repetitions and in an occasional 
disregard of chronological order. Many por- 
traits and a full index are provided, as well as 
numerous footnotes.

Toltunes on the history of Costume ? From page 
to page the reader wavers between the two 
expressions, smiling over the grotesque and 
incongruous fixings, sighing over the extrava- 
gance, the discomfort, the ugliness. Fortu- 
i nately, however, both authors take an indidgent 
j attitude toward the facts thej^ record, so that 
I under their influence the smile is likely to pre- 
i dominate, though chastened by consciousness of 
pathos. 

For the manner of both recortls, the reader 
can have littie but praise. Both authors are fully 
responsive to their subjects, both describe clearly 
and fuUy, and both know the value of plentiful 
illustrations. Mrs. Aria, writing much the 
smaller book, takes a wider range of subject, 
and treats it eclecticaUy. After brief but in- 
cisive comment on Greek, Roman, and mediseval 
dress, she gives a chapter to the most striking 
characteristics of costume in each century from 
the thirteenth through the nineteenth. While 
English costume is chiefly considered, there are 
iUimiinating glimpses of German, French, and 
Italian fashions, at corresponding times. Added 
chapters on peasant, oriental, bridal, dancing, 
ceremonial, and threatrical dress will make the 
volmne a lamp and a guide to those in search 
of inspiration for fancy dress costumes. The 
text is often witty and always interesting. Mr. 
Anderson, the illustrator, can scarcely be over- 
praised for the excellence of his work. Hating 
all ugliness, he deftly turns a picturesque aspect 
of even the most impossible fashions toward us. 
How he manages to make them so attractive is 
past comprehension, unless it is by associating 
them with beautiful faces. Who would not wear 
a monstrous hennin on her locks, or a ship in full 
sail, or even horns a yard long, if by so doing she 
coidd look as winsome as these pictured ladies ? 
Even to Queen Elizabeth in full panoply of 
peace (and was ever panoply of war so formid- 
able?) he gives a face as sweet as the traditional 
dairymaid's. The sixteen colored plates are a 
delight to behold, with form and line studied to 
the perfection of grace, and colors so delicate 
and so weU blended that they fairly melt in the 
eye. Between author and illustrator, the reader 
closes the book with a thoroughly kindly feeling 
toward departed fashions, though with the hope 
that there is no impiety in being thankful they 
are departed. 

Intensively, Mr. Calthrop is much more 
ambitious in his book, though he confines his 
attention to English costume. Of this his treat- 
ment is so thorough as to merit for his work 
the old-fashioned phrase " a complete compen-

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



dium." Each reign, from the Conqueror's 
down, receives a chapter impartially divided 
between the wear of men and of women, and 
illustrated with two full-page figures in color. 
These seventy canvases — one can scarcely 
speak of them as anything less — destine the 
book to be used chiefly as that most delectable 
of creations, a picture-book for " grown-ups," 
with educational value enough to salve the 
mature conscience for enjoying such things. 
This destiny is ma<le more sure by half-tone 
reproductions of some thirty engravings by 
Hollar and sixty by the Dightons, with innu- 
merable line-tlrawings by the author. Mr. 
Calthrop is his own illustrator, and oft«n says 
"If I can't describe this, I can draw it." His 
use of color is daring, but his artistic sense is 
as sure as it is cheerful ; so that his portrait 
gallery, though higher in tone than Mr. 
Anderson's, is equally grateful to the eye. In 
his drawings, his sense of humor is often appar- 
ent. What matter whether the sketch is pretty 
or not, if it correctly represents the fact ? In 
his writing, Mr. Calthrop is something less of 
an artist. Still, in making a conij)endium, he 
could hardly avoid packing his facts. After 
the enormous amount of research, it is remark- 
able that he can handle his subject as lightly as 
he does. Interesting and reatlable he certainly 
is, in spite of an occasional sli^) in idiom or 
construction. He has a happy faculty for mak- 
ing his costumes live, as it were, in the times 
to which they belong. Taking his stand in 
Caxton's shop at the beginning of Edward IV. 's 
reign, he says : 

" You will notice that all, or nearly all, the passers- 
hy Caxton's have long hair; that the dandies have extra- 
long hair brushed out in a cloud at the back; that the 
older men wear long, very simple gowns, which they 
belt in at the waist with a stuff or leather belt, on which 
is himg a bag-purse; that these plain gowns are laced 
across the front to the waist over a vest of some colored 
stuff other tlian the gown. . . . Edward himself has 
been to the shop, and has consented to become patron 
of an edition of Tidly, — Edward with his verj' subtle 
face, his tall, handsome appearance, his cold, elegant 
manners. He is dressed in a velvet gown edged with 
fur; the neck of the gown is low, and the silk vest 
shows above it. Across his chest are gold laces taper- 
ing to his waist ; these are strait across the front of his 
gown-opening. His hair is strait and falls to the nape 
of his neck. The skirts of his gown reach to his knees, 
and are fur-edged; his sleeves are full at the elbows 
and tight over his wrists; he is wearing red Spanish 
leather tall boots, turned over at the top." 

This vivifying method, together with the fact 
that Mr. Calthrop does not forget to describe 
the dress of the common people, will render the 
book invaluable to students of history. Equally 



satisfactory is his evolutionary sense, by which 
he traces the continuous development of new 
species from old ; he not only declares that the 
liripipe came from the peak of the hood, the 
vest from the surcoat, and the coat from the 
timic, but shows by description and drawing 
how it all happened. He believes, too, in the 
causal connection between life and clothes, and 
the doubts which that belief gives ri.se to atld 
the spice of imanswered inquiry to his pages. 
He can go so far as to say that " a fashion is 
born, not maxle." But whether clothes result 
from character or character from clothes, he 
has not yet decided. It is much, however, to 
keep before us the Sartor-philosophy that " in 
this one pregnant subject of Clothes, rightly 
understood, is included all that men have 
thought, dreamed, done, or been," and we shall 
not blame him if he could not, any more than 
Sartor himself, tell us just how the inclusion 
came about. May Estelle Cook. 



Ten Famous Frenchmen.* 



Mr. Tallentyre's " Life of Voltaire," published 
a few years ago, was favorably received, and 
aroused renewed interest in the character and 
career of the man who stood for liberty when 
the word, for France, was nothing more than a 
historical expression. But Voltaire, as is well 
known, was only one — though the leatling one 
— of a cluster of great names, the " alpha," as 
astronomers say, of a constellation which illu- 
minates that part of the heavens of history 
known as the eighteenth century. It was 
inevitable that Mr. Tallentyre, while prosecut- 
ing his Voltairean studies, should have become 
profoundly interested in the other thinkers and 
philo-sophers whose lives and writings constituted 
a noble protest against the age-long tyranny 
whose knell they helped to sound. These by- 
products of his researches he has now gathered 
into a volume which forms a valuable supple- 
ment to his Life of Voltaire and will be welcomed 
by all atlmirers of that book. 

" The Friends of Voltaire " is cast in the 
form of anecdotal biography, and tells the stories 
of ten men whose lives fell very closely together, 
the earliest birth among them dating from 1713, 
and only one of them (Grimm) living into the 
nineteenth century (1807). The ten men were 
thus true contemporaries ; and, aside from their 
friendship with Voltaire, they were more or

York: Q. P. Putnam's Sons.

THE DIAL

less closely associated with one another. Mr. 
Tallentyre endeavors to characterize them by 
giving each an identifying label, as follows : 
D'Alembert the Thinker, Diderot the Talker, 
Galiani the Wit. Vauvenargues the Aphorist, 
D'Holbach the Host. Grimm the Journalist, 
Helvetius the Contratliction, Turgot the States- 
man, Beaumarchais the Playwright. Condorcet 
the Aristocrat. 

At one period or another in his long and 
stormy life, Voltaire was brought into touch 
with these apostles of liberalism. Some of them 
knew him but slightly, and he did not hesitate 
to criticize them caustically enough at times : 
but on the whole, as the author says. '• their 
aim was his aim, to destroy from among the 
people * ignorance, the curse of God '": and they, 
like him. " were the prophets and the makers 
of a new dispensation." So the term '• Friends 
of Voltaire " is not Ul-chosen. 

The ten studies are of nearly the same 
length, but of varying merit : the most penetra- 
tion and sjTupathy being shown in the papers 
on D'Alembert and Diderot, the creators of 
the famous Enoyclop&lic. The gay little abbe 
Galiani is sketched with something of his own 
incisive wit , and the good-natured " mmtre 
tj' hotel of philosophy."' the rich Baron d'Holbach, 
whose hospitable homes in the Rue Royale and 
at Grandval were for nearly thirty years head- 
quarters for the wits and celebrities of all 
nations, is given a meed of gratitude as having 
provided the remhzvou» for those who were 
engagetl in the great intellectual revival of the 
time. Vauvenargues, the author of a single 
lxx)k, is perhaps the most winning face that 
looks upon us from the walls of this little gal- 
lerj-. A Rochefoucaidd without the cynicism, 
his maxims leave only a good taste in the mouth 
and a good impidse in the heart. Prosperity- 
soured La Rochefoucauld ; adversity traine<l 
and sweetenetl Vauvenargues, and we may, with 
Mr. Tallentyre, say of him that the flippant 
and false, clever and silly eighteenth centurs* 
is " in some sort redeemed by the brave silent 
life and the high ideals he proved practical and 
not visionary by fulfilling himself, of this soldier 
aphorist." 

In this decade of essayists, probably the 
least articidate was the statesman Turgot : but 
he wrought with all the powers God and man 
had given him for the betterment of his oi>- 
pressed feUow-coimtr^nuen. It is a familiar 
story to the students of French history, but 
it is not one to be told with leWty; and Mr. 
Tallentyre, on approaching it. lays aside the 



spaiUing and debonair style which seemed an 
appropriate medium for Voltaire and his friends. 
With grave and measured speech, as of one 
walking over a* battlefield, he sketches the eon- 
tlitions which prevailed in France during the 
reign of Louis the " Well-beloved." " Consider 
that these people had been scourged for genera- 
tions by hundreds of imjust and senseless laws, 
made by and for the benefit of their oppressors, 
' and that they were now the ■snctims of taxes 
whose very name has become an indictment and 
whose description is a justification of the French 
Revolution." Then follows a brief accoimt of 
the oppressive taiUe, corvee, mil ice, and guhelle, 
and of the still more frightful irregular burdens 
which could be imposed at any time by the 
autocrat at Versailles. 

" What effect would hundreds of years of such oppres- 
sion hare on the character of the oppressed ? Hopeless, 
i filthy, degraded, superstitious with the cra-»ien superstition 
which made them the easy prey of their unscrupulous 
olergT and left them wholly sensual and stupid; as 
animals, without the animals' instinctiTe joy of life and 
fearlessness of the morrow ; with no ambitions for them- 
selves or the children who turned to curse them for 
having brought them into such a world ; with no time to 
dream or love, no time for the tenderness which makes 
i life life indeed, — they toiled for a few cruel years be- 
I caoae they feai«i to die, and died because they feared to 
live. Such were the people Turgot was sent to redeem." 

As Intendant of Limoges, and later as Con- 
troller-General of Finances, Turgot succeeded 
in alleviating many abuses which it would take 
a French Revolution to sweep entirely away. 

Of other friends of Voltaire, — of Grimm 
the astute journalist. Helvetius the materialist, 
Beaimiarchais of "Figaro" renown, — Mr. 
Tallentyre writes with a light but assured 
touch, doing justice to their merits and their 
services in the great cause, and leaving of them 
all such convincing pen-picttires as almost to 
make needless the ten portraits with which the 
lx)ok is embellished. 

There are many glimpses, too, of the brilliant 
women whose gay and easy society was alike a 
relaxation and a stimiUus to these thinkers and 
%\-riters — from Catherine the Great of Russia 
down to ilme. de Tencin, the intellectual but 
heartless mother of D'Alembert. This philo- 
sopher was later comforted, however, for his 
i mother's desertion of him, by the companionship 
and affection of Julie de Lespinasse ; and the 
admirers of Mrs. Humphry Ward will appre- 
ciate the allusion to one of her later novels in 
the following paragraph : 

I " The history of that menage, of the brilliant, impul- 
sive, undisciplined girl, with her plain face and her 
matchless charm, and of the blind old woman she

is one of the familar anecdotes of literature." 

The book, throughout, is entertaining, and 
helpful to a clear understanding of a momentous 
and often misunderstood epoch in both history 
and literature. JosiAH Renick Smith. 



The Old British Engravers.* 



Mr. Salaman's account of the old English 
engravers is a work of rare interest and enter- 
tainment. To the lover of the old copper-plate 
prints, who appreciates an engraving for its 
beauty, its charm, and its artistic merit, whether 
in line, in mezzotinto, or in stipple, the book 
will commend itself most highly, as it is written 
wholly from the artistic standpoint, with no 
consideration for the commercial side which 
measures the value of a print alone by its 
auction-room price. On this point the author 
says : " I have liad no thought for that print- 
collector with whom considerations of ' state ' 
and margin are more urgent than the appeal of 
pictorial beauty or human interest. To him, 
the price at Christie's will count, perhaps, for 
more than the intrinsic interest of the print, or 
the life-story of the engraver." 

Mr. Salaman traces copper-plate engi-aving 
in England from 1540, when it made its first 
appearance "in a book of midwifery called 
' The Byrth of Mankynde,' surely a very ap- 
propriate title to begin \vith," and tells us that 
"the earliest known example of copper-plate 
engraving devoted by a native artist primarily 
to the service of portraiture " was " Eliza 
Triumphans," a portrait of England's Virgin 
Queen, by William Rogers, in 1589. Rogers 
was not, however, the earliest known engraver 
in England, that distinction belonging to 
Thomas Geminus, a surgeon in the household 
of Henry VIII., who copied the plates for the 
famous book on anatomy by Vesalius, in 1545. 
Among the seventeenth-century men who fol- 
lowed in line engiaving, the names best known 
are Elstrack, de Passe, Droeshout (who at 
twenty-two engraved Shakespeare's portrait for 
the first folio edition of his works and which, 
mirahile dictu, called forth Ben Jonson's lines

of approval), William Marshall (whose portrait 
of Milton the poet derided in Greek lines that 
he gave to the unsuspecting engraver to set 
beneath it), Faithorne (who has preserved for 
us jjossibly the only authentic likeness of the 
blind Milton, which he rendered from life when 
the poet was sixty-two), Wenceslaus, HoUar, 
and Robert White. 

The beautiful art of mezzotinting not unnatu- 
rally comes in for the greatest space, and its 
history is most admirably given in the running 
story of the lives and works of the famous 
scrapers, from Prince Rupert down to Reynolds, 
Turner, and Cousins, the last of the masters 
who began by using cojjper-plates and finished 
their careers on jilates of hardened steel. The 
great English line engravers of the eighteenth 
century. Strange, Woollett, and Sharp, whose 
best works have never been equalled by men in 
any other land, receive just and appreciative 
consideration, and the volume closes with a 
notice of Bartolozzi, Ryland, Caroline Watson, 
Schiavonetti, Burke, and the other like pro- 
ducers of those " pretty " stipple pictures after 
Angelica Kauffmann and Cijiriani that have 
won the admiration of beginners in the cultiva- 
tion of a taste for the gi-eat reproductive art of 
engraving. 

The volume is indeed a combination of good 

things well served. Gossip and portraiture and 

art are deftly interlaced, so that the reading of 

the pages is no less agreeable than instructive.

A Forgotten Chapter in Western 

EXl'LORATION.* 



So little is heard nowadays of the achieve- 
ments of that notable little gi'oujj of adventurous 
mariners who explored the Northwest coa.st of 
our continent, that one is inclined to welcome 
with more than ordinary enthusiasm Professor 
Meany's bulky volume bearing the alluring- 
title " Vancouver's Discovery of Puget Sound." 
From the words of his preface, one is indeed 
led to expect a contributioil of much more than 
ordinary importance to the literature of North- 
western discovery, — in fact, such an exhaustive 
piece of editing as, for instance, is associated 
with the name of the late Dr. Elliott Coues. 
" The sources for a work of this kind," says Pro- 
fessor Meany, " are not easily accessible. Part 
of them have been jirinted in journals and voy-

ages, the books being long since out of print 
and rare ; but by far the greater portion of the 
sources are in the public and private archives of 
England and Spain." One gathers from what 
follows that Professor Meany was fortunate 
enough to enlist the cooperation of a host of 
helpers at home and abi-oad, including the Lords 
Commissionei-s of the . Admii-alty, the Elder 
Brethren of Trinity House, the Secretary of the 
Spanish Royal Academy of History, and the 
Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, — to 
mention no others, — and that his ovm researches 
extendetl over many yeai-s. In face of all this 
it is somewhat disconcerting to discover that of 
the 340 pages in Professor Meany's lx)ok some 
280 are taken up with a verbatim reprint of 
Vancouver's narrative (pp. 33 to 385 of vol. II. 
of the second edition). To this text Professor 
Meany adds a number of foot-notes, for the most 
part, in the words of his sub-title, " biographies 
of the men honored in the naming of geographic 
features of Northwestern America." The first 
sixty pages are occupie<l by an introduction, 
followed by brief biographies of Vancouver and 
Quadra, and an historic sketch of Xootka Sound. 
With a few trifling exceptions, the material 
embodied in these sixty pages is readily acces- 
sible elsewhere, as is also of course Vancouver's 
own narrative. There remain the foot-notes. 
These, indeed, reveal much patient research, 
and are unquestionably of interest and value as 
a commentary upon place-names occurring in 
Vancouver's narrative ; but they go far beyond 
the necessities of the case. For instance, 
Vancouver named a low sandy point of land 
New Dimgeness, because of its resemblance to 
Dungeness in the English Channel. Professor 
Meany not only gives a detailed description of 
the old Dungeness in his foot-note, with a chart 
of the harbor, but branches out into a descrip- 
tion of the old lighthouse at Dimgeness, with 
a photogi-aphic reproduction ; the lighthouse 
brings up the venerable institiition of Trinity 
House, whose history is succinctly given ; and 
this again suggests the new lighthouse, a de- 
scription of which is clipped from an English 
newspaper. All this is doubtless interesting in 
its way, but does not seem very essential to an 
interpretation of Vancouver's narrative. 

In the Introduction, Professor Meany quotes 
a number of passages from one of several logs, 
kept by officers and men of the " Discovery " 
and the " Chatham," and now preserved in the 
Public Record Office at London, a2iro2)os of 
Sir Joseph Banks's charge that Vancouver's 
discipline was harsh in the extreme. Why 



i these disjointed passages are pressed in to bol- 
ster up a charge which. Professor Meany admits 
a page or two later, hatl no adequate foundation, 
it is difficult to imderstand ; but it is much 
more difficult to imderstand why, having access 
to this mine of contemporary material, he should 
have made no further use of it. One can think 
of many obscure points in Vancouver's nar- 
rative which might have been made clear by 
the evidence of these original records, if some 
of the energy devoted to the elucidation of quite 
irrelevant questions had been turned in this 
direction. 

All this soimds rather imgrateful, but it is 
disappointing to find so much genuine scholar- 
ship expended to, comparatively speaking, so 
little purpose. Lawrence J. Burpee.

unknown to us. He proves his quality so well in 
" Fanshawe of the Fifth " that we hope to make his 
further acquaintance. The story, which drags at 
first, but grows steadily in interest, is concerned with 
the adventures of a younger son of the Fanshawes

not, however, a stoiy of warfare, for the hero pet-

whose simple virtues react upon his own character, 
giving it strength and serious purpose. When for- 
tune unexpectedly comes to him, we feel tliat he 
fairly deserves it, as well as the love of the Quaker 
maiden whose gentle influence has done so much for 
him. The story is essentially one of manners and 
customs — the manners and customs of a rough age, 
and of both the higher and the lower classes of 
society. Gamblers, horse-thieves, blackguards, and 
rustics of many types figure in its pages. It is a 
story which exhibits much knowledge of men and 
affairs, a story which could not have been written 
by anyone not thoroughly imbued with the traditions 
of his race. It offei-s us the real thing, as distin- 
guished from the artificial fabrication of the novelist 
who " gets up " his subject. 

" Katherine " is the latest novel of Mr. E. Temple 
Thurston. Katherine Crighton was a young woman 
with a temperament. When her portrait (at the age 
of eighteen months) was exhibited in the galleries 
that fact was recognized, and it was generally pre- 
dicted that she would be heard from when she gi-ew 
up. When the eighteen months had become that 
number of years, or thereabouts, she married John 
Spurrier, Member of Parliament. Then she dis- 
covered that she wanted to be loved, and concluded 
that John did not love her in the right way. As a 
matter of fact, he loved her in the best way possible, 
but what she wanted was an effusive sentiment which 
it was not in his nature to bestow. So she allowed 
a philandering military gentleman to captivate her 
fancy. Presently she heard her death-warrant from 
the lips of a physician. She was a victim of cancer, 
and had not more than two years to live. This made 
her desperate, and she very nearly let herself go. 
Like the Abbesse de Jouarre, she wanted to get all 
there was out of life before the end came. She wa.s 
indiscreet enough to visit her lover in his lodgings, 
and had just decided to run away with him, when 
John took a hand in the affair, had a brief but 
lK)inted interview with the military gentleman, and 
persuaded liim that he had better quit. Then it 
turned out that the physician liad been mistaken in 
his diagnosis, and that she was in no danger after 
all. This changed the whole face of matters. The 
lover would have been all very well for a year or 
two, but she concluded that John vrould wear better. 
He, being highly magnanimous, forgave her for the 
sinful intention, and we are expected to believe in 
a happy future for the two. This story, weighted 
with much futile philosophizing, is not exactly 
edifying, and its dulness is relieved by few flashes 
of brilliancy. 

Another woman with a temperament is the heroine 
of " The Wingless Victory," by Mr. M. P. Willcocks. 
She lives on the South Devon Coast, and is the wife 
of the village physician. The husband is a rough 
diamond, and there was no sentiment in the marriage 
upon either side, the man having been impelled to 
it by the most prosaic considerations, and the woman 
by an experimental impulse. Not long thereafter, she 
turns the head of a youthful artist, native to those 



parts, and allows him to make callow love to her. 
When he is driven to supposed suicide, she takes the 
matter much to heart, and wonders what punishment 
fate has in store for her. Presently a child is born, 
becomes blind, and then dies of croup, which occur- 
rences seem to indicate that her imaginary sin has 
found its punishment. Meanwhile, an interesting 
situation has developed in the village over the ques- 
tion of water-supply — -a situation which finds her 
husband nearly in the position of Dr. Stockmann in 
" An Enemy of the People." He is hounded out of 
position and practice, and his wife finds a hiding- 
place in Dartmoor. Here she poses as a maiden, 
and spreads her net for a young farmer, who is 
captured only to discover that he has been tricked 
by a married woman. Having carried this experi- 
ment to successful completion, the woman concludes 
that duty now calls her back to her husband, with 
whom, after some difficulty, she reassumes conjugal 
relations. The author seems to find some sort 
of justification for all this erratic conduct in the 
woman's desire to live, to have experience, to realize 
herself; but the reader of sane instincts will foUow 
her career with slight sympathy. The book has 
strength, however, although not in this plot with 
its dubious ethical implications. It is the strength 
of keen analysis, vivid descriptive power, and a 
characterization of the rustic population of Devon 
and Dartmoor fairly comparable with the work of 
Mr. Phillpbtts and other disciples of the school of 
Thomas Hardy. 

In summing up our recollections of "The Country 
House," by Mr. John Galsworthy, we are a little 
surprised at the contrast between the slightness of 
the story and the degree of interest which it has 
awakened. It concerns only the members of a small 
country family, with a few neighbors and visitors, 
only a few episodes of rather commonplace character. 
The only thing approaching the dramatic is the son 
and heir's entanglement with the wife of a drunken 
reprobate, who has, iievertheless, sufficient self- 
respect to institute divorce proceedings when he 
learns of the intrigue, and decency enough to with- 
draw them when he realizes that the prosecution of 
his case would hurt other people besides the guilty 
pair. This same son and heir also goes in for 
horse-racing, and gets deep into debt as a conse- 
quence. He makes a pretty poor hero ; in fact, the 
story has neither hero nor heroine in the proper 
sense, and only a couple of characters with whom 
we have any sympathy whatever. Yet it is, as we 
have already suggested, an extremely interesting 
story, made so by the extraordinary precision of 
its characterization and literary phrasing. Few 
novelists are as successful as Mr. Giilsworthy in 
adapting their means to their purposes, with the 
result, as in the present instance, of giving vivid 
reality to a group of commonplace people, and of 
reproducing the very atmosphere of the scenes in 
which they move. 

It was no very serious matter — an indiscreet 
note, the gift of a trinket, and a stolen kiss — but

it had serious consequences. Tony Palliser, heir to 
an English country estate, and betrothed to Violet 
Wayne, was the culprit, and he was weak enough 
to let his poor kinsman. Bernard Appleby, bear 
the blame. The girl with whose affections he had 
trifled was a gamekeeper's daughter, and her father 
proceeded to blackmail Tony with considerable 
success. Finally. Bernard took a hand, interviewed 
the fellow, and knocked him down. The game- 
keeper, who was drunk at the time, picked himself 
up, then stumbled into the river and was drowned, , 
When his body was found the next day. bearing | 
marks of violence, Bernard promptly drew suspicion 
to himself by fleeing from the country. We are 
glad on the whole that he fled, for otherwise we 
should have missed the capital«story which follows. 
Bernard finds his way to Cuba, becomes a leader 
of a band of insurgents, and is mixed up in many 
exciting skirmishes. Then a rich American who 
has befriended him puts him in charge of a sug^- 
plantation in the disaffected district. When news 
comes of the Maine disaster, he concludes that the 
psychological moment has arrived, and he saves his 
employer's interests by boldly coming out on the 
side of the insurgents. Jleanwhile. his employer's 
daughter, who has gone to England, finds herself 
among the scenes from which Bernard has fled. 
She causes the truth to transpire, and the wretched 
Tony, convicted of cowardice, starts for Cuba to see 
if he can make reparation. He makes it by saving 
Bernard's life, and at the same time conveniently 
dies in a skirmish. Tliis leaves the field clear for 
Bernard, who presently goes back to England, 
renews his actjuaintance witli Violet whom he has 
loved in secret all the time, and receives the pledge 
of her affection. This is the bare outline of a story 
which is rich in dramatic interest, and which ex- 
hibits remarkable powers of characterization and 
description. It is the work of ^Ir. Harold Bindloss. 
and is called " The Dust of Conflict," 

The historical romance of classical times is apt to 
be an unsatisfactorj' performance. The Crermans 
have been its chief practitioners, but have rarely 
succeeded in giv-ing dramatic cogencj' to their pro- 
ductions, or to their characters the breath of life. 
Bulwer and Charles Kingsley probably came as neai- 
to success as is possible for a modern novelist, for 
the difficulties of the task are well-nigh insuperable. 
Either the story will be so stiffened by archaeologj- 
as to present but the semblance of living action, or 
the treatment will be so frankly romantic as to 
destroy all verisimilitude. Mr. William .Stearns 
Davis, in •• A Victor of Salamis," has been measur- 
ably successful in steering between this Scylla and 
this Charybdis, and it is possible to read his book 
with a certain degree of interest, although he has 
to rely largely upon the adventitious aid of those 
consecrated associations which make the heart leap 
at the verj- names of Thermopylae and Salamis and 
Plataea. These memorable struggles are his theme, 
and his list of characters includes Leonidas and 
Themistocles. Mardonius and the Great King. The I 



battle scenes are described with vivid particularity, 
and the private interest of the narrative is provided 
by the fortunes of one Glaucon. an Athenian, falsely 
accused of medizing, driven into exile with the 
Persians, and returning at a critical moment to 
assist in the final repulse of the barbarian invader 
and bring discomfiture to his personal enemies. 
Knowledge and deep sympathy combine to make 
the book something more than readable, which is 
perhaps all that was to be expected of it. 

"Beatrix of Clare," by Mr. John Reed Scott, 
is tite latest example — and a glaring one — of 
Wardour Street fiction. It is a romance of 
Richard III., representing that maligned monarch 
as a noble character, albeit astute enough to fall in 
with the conditions of fifteenth century political 
morality. The story b^^ shortly before the mur- 
der of the princes in the Tower (of which crime 
Richard is held guiltless), and ends just before the 
invasion of Richmond. In manner and sentiment 
it is poor stuff, and about as unreal as possible. The 
knightly hero and the proud heroine are tricked out 
with the usual attributes of such lay figures, and 
the course of their love has to conquer the usual 
impediments before they are finally united. 

Squire Warden is the leading citizen of a small 
New England Town. He is something of a skin- 
flint, and his wealth has been acquired by various 
forms of sharp practice. In one case, many years 
before we become acquainted with him, cupidity had 
made him a criminal, for he had forged a wnll to 
his own benefit. Retribution is long delayed, but 
i-omes at last with the visit to his house one night 
of a piratical sea-farer, who brings with him a little 
girL This picturesque old ruffian is the person 
whom the f org^ wfll has dispossessed, and the little 
girl is his child. By a combination of moral suasion 
with physical violence he persuades the Squire to 
adopt the child and pay a substantial sum of hush- 
money to her father. Several years then elapse, 
and the girl grows up to be an attractive young 
woman. Then the pirate reappears, settles down 
in the village, and proceeds to bleed the Squire at 
frequent intervals. His operations are conducted 
with a fine sense of humor, and we sj-mpathize with 
them to a certain degree, especially when we dis- 
cover that the money he wrings from his unwilling 
^'ictuu is- being hoarded for the benefit of his 
daughter. Then the Squire, who owns a mill, has 
trouble with his men, and his tormentor takes parti- 
cular delight in forcing him to make concessions to 
the fanatical agitator who has fomented the disturb- 
ance. The heroine, who is sought after by this very 
objectionable young man. is almost persuaded to 
become his wife in order to appease her guardian, 
now driven frantic by the dread of exposure. But 
she is saved from this fate by the intervention of 
an artist-lover, who bears her triumphantly away. 
These are the chief ingredients of a storj- wliic.h, 
despite its fantastic character, sustains our interest 
to the end. It is called " The Upper Hand," and 
is the work of Mr. Emerson Gifford Tavlor.

THE DIAL. 



[August 1, 



The New Villain of American fiction, as we all 
know, is not the primitive creature who used to be 
the foil of virtue, and whose vulgar crimes we so 
willingly abhorred. His place is now usurped by 
the industrial magnate whose instruments of crime 
are political corruption, and the exploitation of 
the masses, and the crushing of the weak com- 
petitor. He has his nemesis, as a rule, not in the 
shape of unmasking and outward disgrace, but 
in the sting of a tardily-awakened conscience, or 
an uneasy realization that his success has not been 
worth its cost. The favorite form of treatment is 
to represent him as a loving husband or parent, 
woimded in his tenderest susceptibilities by the wife 
or children whose eyes become opened to the sources 
of his wealth, and whose condemnation, silent or 
expressed, is to him the most terrible of punishments. 
A typical example of this new-fashioned treatment 
of an old theme is given us in '' The Giant's Strength," 
by Mr. Basil King. Paul Trafford, who is the richest 
man in America, is the giant, and his strength is 
tyrannously used for the purpose of driving his rivals 
to the wall. Discomfiture comes when his daughter 
falls in love with the son of one of those defeated 
rivals, and grows estranged from her father when 
she learns by what means he has acquired his 
fortune. The conclusion of the whole matter is 
touchingly sentimental, but not, we fear, altogether 
probable, for the chastened magnate undergoes a 
change of heart, becomes reconciled to his foes, both 
of the household and the mart, and we leave him 
bestowing his blessing upon the lovers and seek- 
ing to repair as far as possible the mischief he has 
done. 

The contrasted ideals of civic and political moral- 
ity held, respectively, by the older and the younger 
generation, are once more presented to our view 
in " By Right Divine," Mr. William Sage's latest 
invention. The older generation is represented by 
Senator Fordyce of Keenville, who has long held 
his State (politically) in the hollow of his band, 
having for his allies a choice assortment of leading 
citizens. Francis Thayer, elected Governor of the 
State at the age of thirty-five, represents the younger 
generation, and it becomes his task to unmask the 
Senator and defeat the nefarious schemes of the cor- 
rupt political ring. Having outlined so much of the 
situation, we are almost ashamed to waste further 
space by adding that the Senator has a daughter, who 
is devoted to her father, but who is forced to condemn 
him when his iniquities are exposed. Mr. Sage 
handles this stock situation skilfully, and gives his 
story a certain freshness by various accessory devices. 
The plot contrived for the hero's undoing is too 
flimsy to gain much credence, and it must have 
been a very guUible Senate (we forgot to mention 
that the Governor had been translated to Washington 
as his enemy's colleague) that voted to unseat him 
upon the evidence offered. At the critical moment, 
the arch-offender comes to the scratcli, confides his 
guilt to an astonished Senate, and takes his leave 
of politics forever. We refrain from insulting the 



intelligence of our readers by telling them what be- 
comes of his daughter. 

Miss Marjorie Bowen is a young woman who 
will bear watching. Her first novel, '' The Viper 
of Milan," was rather preposterous, and nothing but 
the extreme youth of the writer could justify the 
praise which it got in certain interested quarters. 
Her second novel, " The Master of Stair," is so 
much more creditable a work that its merits are in 
no need of puffery. The breeziness with which it 
handles a disputed historical situation is a passport to 
our favor, although hardly suggestive of the critical 
temper. Its subject is the massacre of Gleucoe, and 
the Master of Stair is the arch-villain of the tragedy. 
As for the King, he stands acquitted of anything 
worse than thoughtlessness in signing an order the 
purport of which is concealed from him, and his 
one appearance in the narrative is very cleverly 
managed. Miss Bowen has an amiable way of 
despatching her characters when they have served 
their purpose, a practice to be commended, because 
it greatly simplifies the cleai-ing-up process of the 
closing chapter. 

There seems to be no subject of scientific con- 
jectm'e that the novelist may not, sooner or later, 
find fitted to his purpose. This eagerness to exploit 
the latest thing in thought or discovery shows how 
hard-pressed the writer of fiction is becoming under 
the stress of the popular demand for more, and 
still more, novels. It is not altogether a wholesome 
tendency, since the old material is good enough for 
the writer who knows how to use it, and the new 
material is often of questionable value for the uses of 
fiction. The subject of dual personality is just now 
in the air; it is a subject of which science itself 
knows next to nothing as yet. But this fact offers 
no obstacle to the novelty-seeking story-teller ; rather 
does it encourage him in his determination to dis- 
course of all things on earth and in heaven, with 
small regard for anything but picturesque or imagi- 
native effect. We have read three novels of dual 
personality within the past twelvemonth ; two of 
them were trifling affairs designed to be amusing 
and nothing more, but the third is the work of 
a serious wTiter whose talents we regi'et to see 
wasted upon so unprofitable a theme. It is entitled 
" The Invader," and is written by Mrs. Margaret L. 
Woods. The heroine is a young woman, a student 
struggling for honors at an Oxford College, who has 
the unpleasant habit of falling into a long sleep 
every few months, and awakening with a different 
character and a different set of memories. This is 
particularly embarrassing to the don whom she mar- 
ries, because he is in love with one of her alternating 
characters and indifferent toward the other. More- 
over, such is the perversity of man, it is the frivolous 
and reckless Mildred whom he loves, and not the 
clinging and conscientious Milly. When the young 
woman awakes in the former character, she makes 
things particularly lively for her entourage, and 
when she becomes MUly once more, she suffers 
from the consequences of Mildred's pranks. In

the chara<"t*r of Milly. ■which seems to be that which 
is normally hers, she conceives a horror of the other 
creature who invades her peaceful domestic existence, 
and when she finds out that her husband prefers 
Mfldred to herself, she puts an end to her rival's 
existence by drowning the tenement common to 
them both. The interest of this fantastic tale is 
but moderate, which is chiefly due to the fact that 
the author takes her subject over-seriously. instead 
of frankly abandoning herself to its possibilities of 
comedy and dramatic effect. 

'• FrSnlein Schmidt and Mr. Anstmther " is a 
story told wholly in letters. Moreover, the letters 
are all written by one person, to wit.. Fraulein Rose- 
Marie Schmidt, of Jena, the daughter of an impe- 
cunious scholar who writes unsalable books, and 
who occasionally takes young Englishmen into the 
family to teach them German. One of these guests 
is Roger Anstruther. who, when the storj- opens, 
has just left for England after making violent love 
to Rose-Marie, and contracting a secret engagement 
with her. It is in her letters to him that the story 
is unfolded : from them we learn how his love grows 
chill after a week or so. how he becomes engaged 
to an English heiress, about whom he writes in great 
detail to Rose-Marie, how he fares in various ways 
during the foUowring year (for he keejjs on writing 
and she keeps on replying), how eventually the 
heiress takes umbrage at his voluminous Gennan 
correspondence and transfers her allegiance to a 
convenient duke, and how Roger then pleads in vain 
to be taken back into the affections of Rose-Marie. 
It is not very much of a story, but that does n't 
greatly matter, because it is Rose-Marie who really 
interests us all the while, and because her letters are 
the most delightful compound of bourgeois realism, 
sentimental fancy, and delicate humor. In one 
aspect, the book gives us the annals of a new 
Buchholz family ; in another, it pictures a charming 
individuality. It is quite evident that Roger made 
a bad mistake when he let Rose-Marie slip from his 
grasp. 

Mrs. Martin's intimate studies of the " Pennsyl- 
vania Dutch " have again borne fruit in a story 
marked by unusual powers of penetrating observa- 
tion. It is, moreover, a story of considerable human 
interest in the wider sense, although we find it some- 
what difficult to accept the extraordinary heroine. 
This young woman is of gentle extraction, but she 
has been abandoned in her infancy, and has fallen 
into the hands of a thrifty and illiterate German 
farmer, in whose family she grows up as the house- 
hold drudge. To all outward seeming the embod- 
iment of stolidity, she has, nevertheless, by the aid 
of a library of good literature left by her parents 
and stowed away in an unoccupied corner of the 
farmhouse, made herself a woman of refined culture 
in the best sense, although childishly ignorant of the 
actual world of cultivation. When the farmer opens 
his doors to take in summer boarders, her opportunity 
appears, for among these boarders is the young 



professor of psychologj' in a neighboring university. 
He discovers the young woman's true character, and 
at the same time discovers documents which make 
her an heiress. For all this, she could do no less 
than love him, and the conventional romantic out- 
come ensues. A vein of charming comedy is 
supplied by the appearance, among the summer 
boarders, of the university president's daughter, a 
soulful creature for whom life is one protracted pose. 
During her stay, the professor protects himself by 
assuming the disguise of a farm hand, maintaining 
the deception far beyond any probable limits. Her 
endeaTors to arouse his slnggish faculties to some 
conception of the higher life makes very diverting 
reading. 

Judith Harriman is the heiress of a French estate 
amounting to twenty million francs, of which she 
may take possession at any moment by presenting 
her claim. This she refuses to do, for some imex- 
plained reason, and comes to America to earn her 
living. This causes despair to her mother, who is 
living in poverty in Paris, and also to the Duke 
de Montr^sor, who has ardently wooed her charms 
and her millions. When her story begins for us, she 
is occupied in giving parlor-talks and recitations at 
a summer-school of soulful philosophers somewhere 
in Connecticut. Here she meets the popular novelist 
and poet, Sidney Conningsby. who promptly suc- 
cumbs to her fascination. After an episode in which 
she is kidnapped by the duke, chloroformed, impris- 
oned in a New York hotel, and m^es her escape, 
she returns to the summer colony, presently marries 
the poet, and goes away with him to spend a year 
on the Isthmus, where be is to write Ids great novel. 
The year elapses, and they return with a manuscript 
and a ehOd. The manuscript is rejected (for some- 
how the novelist seems to have lost his grip) and the 
child dies. Povertv' overtakes the couple, and the 
husband is unfaithful to the wife, who leaves him. 
and becomes the " social secretary " of the real hero 
of the book, a man of ample cardiac and muscular 
development, who has cherished the memorj' of a 
casual meeting with her in France years before. 
Then the faithless husband starts to run away with 
the new object of his affections. Their vehicle 
collides with a trolley-car. and Conningsby is fatally 
injured. Then Judith takes possession of his para- 
mour, carries her away to Paris, claims the millions, 
divides them between her rivaL her mother, and an 
amiable clergyman devoted to charitable works, and 
returns to America penniless. The death of her 
husband has left her free to marry the man who 
has loved her all the time, and she yields grace- 
fully to the inevitable. It will be seen from this 
s\-nop8is that Judith's story is abundantly supplied 
with exciting incident: this is about all that may 
possiUy be said in its favor, for it is both imreal 
in characterization and preposterous in invention. 
It is the work of Miss Frances Agmar Mathews, 
and is entitled " The Undefiled " for some mysteri- 



ous reason.

Romance and » , , , i i t 

hiitoryofihe of the event celebrated, the Janies- 
Jamettownfoik. town Exposition has called out fewer 
books than former expositions. Among the James- 
town books, Mrs. Roger A. Pryor's " The Birth of 
the Nation " (Macniillan) is easily the best. Mrs. 
Pryor has already made interesting contributions to 
history in " The Mother of Washington and Her 
Times " and " Reminiscences of Peace and War," 
both of which are more serious efforts than the 
present volume. In the work under review, Mrs. 
Pryor aims simply to give a readable sketch of the 
early attempts at colonization by the English, with 
special attention to the Jamestown settlement and 
the work of Captain John Smith. It is based upon 
all the available sources, and these have been fairly 
well used. There is no offensive display of the 
critical spirit ; neither is the author credulous. Her 
attitude toward the traditions may be illustrated 
by her comment on John Smith : '- He has been 
accused of coloring his narratives too highly ; indeed, 
of inventing some of them. For myself, I admire 
him too much to concede more than the cum grano 
salts with which, also, we daily and hourly season 
much that we hear." Some of John Smith's fabri- 
cations are forgiven as having been based on the prin- 
ciple enunciated by the Sunday-school boy : " A 
lie is an abomination unto the Lord and a very 
present help in time of trouble." The reader is 
" thankful to Mrs. Pryor for exhibiting the humorous 
side of things. Even the temperance people cannot 
prevent us from feeling amused at the first Indian 
who met his " greefe " through '' hot drinks, liut 
was all right next morning " ; and what a country 
it was where much land could be purchased for 
" two great guns and a grindstone " ! and what a 
man was the redoubtable John Smith, for whom a 
gallows was erected, but who " could not be pre- 
vailed on to use it " I In the way of criticism, it 
may be said that the author seems to think that 
Powhatan is a name, not a title; that too much 
space is devoted to descriptions of the Indians and 
their life, and not enough attention to conditions 
among the colonists ; that there is no index, and 
some of the illustrations would be better suited to 
a work of fiction. The reviewer would also like 
tremblingly to object to the statement of the \'irginia 
lady that a " hoe-cake " is now cooked before the fire ; 
that method is of the past. Mrs. Pryor speaks a 
good word for the too numerous gentlemen who first 
came to the new world ; and her estimate of the 
Jamestown colony is worth quoting : *' The minia- 
ture republic — for such it rapidly grew to l)e in 
nearly everything except in name — held within its 
borders just the elements that distinguish the great 
republic of to-day : some noble spirits with high aims 
and fervent patriotism ; some sordid souls intent 
alone on gain ; some unprincipled, desperate char- 
acters ; others simply useless, idle and ignoble." 



JVative stories ^' ^^ manifest that a unique people 
of Japanese life can best be understood from its own 
anucharacter. literature. A first-rate translation, 
giving the substance and color of the actual thought 
of an insular nation like the Japanese, is worth 
a wagon-load of the impressions of aliens. We 
have in two books by Dr. Walter Dening, issued 
by the Methodist Publishing House of Tokio, 
Japan, such a mirror of life. These two works 
ought to be in every public library. One is entitletl 
" Japan in Days of Yore," in which are ten good 
stories, mostly of the Yedo period of Japan's history, 
with six appendices containing storiettes, essays, de- 
scriptions, and anecdotes, which richly supplement 
the main narratives. The second volume, historical 
and critical in its character, is entitled " A Xew 
Life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi," and is a revised and 
much improved edition of the author's work pub- 
lished in 1888. Dr. Dening, the translator, has 
lived nuich of his adult life-time in Japan, and his 
knowledge of the language and literature is profound 
and exact. His English is limpid, flowing, and well 
reproduces the original. Almost the only criticism 
to be made is upon his two-frequent use of allusions, 
references, and " modern instances," which detract 
from rather than add to the value of his work. 
Nevertheless, it may safely be said that since 
Mitford's " Tales of Old Japan " there has been 
nothing of the sort quite so useful and entertaining 
as these stories of actual .Japanese life, with its lights 
and shadows, its curious customs, its odd and quaint 
phenomena of emotion and ethics, which were pos- 
sible only in feudalism and on an island shut away 
from the rest of the world. The anecdotes of judicial 
procedure under the famous Oka, Echizen no Kami, 
who was a sort of Japanese Solomon, are particularly 
racy. He, too, certainly knew how to decide when 
two women claimed motherhood of the same infant. 
Mr. Dening's foot-notes and explanations of such 
peculiarly Japanese institutions as hara-kiri, ju-jutsu, 
and phases of Bushido, are especially timely when 
even the average Occidental is beginning to discover 
some of the reserves of power which do not appear 
on the surface, but explain why and how the Japanese 
succeed. Turning from native fiction to history, Mr. 
Dening, having digested many books on his favorite 
theme, gives in his other work an animated narrar 
tive of a man who, like Napoleon, was not physically 
imposing, yet who rose from the lowest stratum of 
society to be the unifier and dictator of Japan. Hide- 
yoshi made his way through all obstacles, and even 
built a temple to his own honor, hoping that after 
his death he might be enrolled among the gods of 
his people. Although he failed in this, it is certain 
that in courage, originality, fertility of resource, 
knowledge of human nature, generosity, and versa- 
tility of mind, Hideyoshi had among his countrymen 
few equals and no superiors. lyeyasu, who gave 
Japan peace for two centuries and a half, built upon 
the foundations of Hideyoshi, — or, in the Japanese 
caricature, Xobunaga pounded the dough. Hideyoshi

Those who have read "Ten Acres 
Po'r^."* Enough " and Hubert's " Libertv- and 

a Living " are likely to recall both 
those works on taking up " Three Acres and Liberty," 
by Mr. Bolton Hall : and, aside from the title, there 
are suggestions of both books in the contents — not 
in any attempt at copying, but in the spirit that 
informs the writer. It will be seen that Mr. Hall 
goes several steps farther than the author of the 
first-named book : and he is more enthusiastic than 
Mr. Hubert, who is known to have given up his 
experiment at country living. The volume under 
consideration is not a text'book in agriculture or 
horticulture, but rather a series of suggestive chap- 
ters as to what may be accomplished by those who 
are wearj- of the confinement of city life and are 
willing to work for their freedom. The author has 
been deeply moved by the help afforded needy men 
and women by means of the vacant city lots which 
they are allowed to use for gardens ; and he cites 
many examples, with facts and figures, to show what 
may be done with the smallest plot of ground, both 
in growing and in marketing produce. He lavs 
great stress on intensive culture, and includes a 
chapter descriptive of accessible places where cheap 
land may still be obtained, mentioning also what mav 
be grown there. Of course, not everything that prop- 
erly belongs in such a work could be included, yet 
one notes with some surprise the omission of any 
reference to the peach region of ilichigan. In fact, 
the author is not always sufBciently specific in re- 
gard to regions adapted to special products, probably 
assuming that those who are interested in the sub- 
ject will Investigate further. While, as has been 
said, the work is not a text-book, yet on some un- 
familiar topics there are quite full directions, — 
as. for example, the construction of greenhouses, 
conducting a -violet farm," and prejjaring wild 
drug-plants for market. Other subjects treated are 
••How to Buy the Farm." ••The Kitchen Garden." 
"Tools and Equipment," "Advantages of Capital." 
'• Fruits," " Flowers.'" '■ Novel Live Stock," " Clear- 
ing the Land," " How to Build." While one chapter 
only is headed •• Results to be Expected," the author 
is so full of the subject that it crops out everywhere. 
The style is somewhat colloquial, perhaps inten- 
tionally so. There is an index, also an appendix 
containing a good list of practical reference Ikx^s 
and a vegetable-planting table. 



Thriifr-ttorv Almost half a centnry had passed 
of a famotu between the death of Julie Lespinasse 

FY^hwoman. ^^ ^^^ pubUcation of that corre- 
spondence of hers with the Conte de Guibert which 
made all Paris ring with the passionate love-story 
of this leader of eighteenth cenrurj' salons, a story 
so entirely unsuspected during her lifetime that even 



d'Alembert, her dearest friend and constant com- 
^ panion, accused her of being entirely without heart 
and incapable of love. The correspondence has 
become a part of the world's famous literature, and 
has served as a basis for fiction in many tongues. 
' Only a few years ago, reviewers vied with one 
another for the credit of discovering .Julie de 
Lespinasse in the heroine of '* Lady Rose's 
Daughter," and all those who had not yet made 
the acquaintance of the historical Julie hastened to 
read the famous letters, which were far more fasci- 
nating than any novel written about them could ever 
hope to be. But there was much of mystery still 
: clinging to the noted Frenchwoman's life ; the 
tragedy of her last years had little connection with 
the equally interesting and complex history of her 
youth. — her long Platonic friendship for d'Alembert, 
her influence on Condorcet, Turgot, Hume. Soard. 
Nor did the Guibert letters more than hint at an 
earlier love-affair, quite as intense, as tragic, and as 
mysterious. The Marquis de S^;ur, therefore, did 
a woric of interest to many when he searched the 
archives of all the great French families in any 
intimate way connected with Julie de Lespinasse, 
and, having solved most of the riddles of her life, 
published a book detailing his discoveries. The 
volume is not entirely well constructed, but this is 
; partly due to the necessity under which the author 
I labored of wiping out some mistaken but generally 
' current theories of Julie's birth and early life before 
he proceeded to his direct testimonj-. It would have 
been quite impossible to make a bald biography with 
such interesting material, and the ^larquis de S^^ 
has brought enough personal interest and en^n- 
siasm to his work to counteract largely his lack of 
constructive literary ability. The book has been 
I adequately tnutalated by P. H. Lee Warner, and is 
published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., with an 
interesting photogravure portrait of the charming 
subject.

lettos of this kind under the conditions described: 
' the identity of the writer is concealed, and no 
meaiK are given of substantiating the startling

of the volume, Mr. B. L. Putnam- Weale., is known 
[ as an intelligent writer on Oriental politics and 
i life, and the fact that he becomes in a measure 
I responsible for the contents of the letters seems to 
I give them something of historical value. Whoever 
i the writer is, he certainly has an eye for the pic- 
turesque and the striking, whatever may be said 
of the correctness of his vision in other ways. It 
would be hard to find a more depressing revelation 
of incapacity, indecision, cowardice, and selfishness

than is here given in the account of the terrible 
times tlirough which the besieged legations passed ; 
and the writer does not hesitate even to call the 
names of the diplomats and nationalities of the men 
and women who showed these unlovely qualities. 
A few stand out as real men, — a Japanese colonel, 
an American missionary, a German ambassador ; but 
in the tierce trial most of those whose training ought 
to have made them strong failed to stand the test. 
The reader cannot help feeling that the narrative is 
colored, that the real facts cannot have been quite 
80 lurid or the characters of the men and women 
quite 80 mean as they are here portrayed. But after 
all deductions are made, the story here given, of 
the Warning, the Siege, and the Sack, is remarkably 
interesting, even though it is full of horrors, largely 
through the remarkable power of the writer to make 
his cliaracters and events live in his pages. 

Theaeveiopment ^^ pointed out by Mr. Otto Walter 
of photography Beck, in his " Art Principles in Por- 
at a free art. ^rait Photography" (The Baker & 
Taylor Company), the processes inherited from 
Daguerre remain practically unchanged to-day, and 
their results are known popularly as " good straight 
photogi'aphy." Mr. Beck asserts that this plain 
photography, enslaved by commercialism, has run 
into a lifeless groove. Its direct result has been to 
instil a taste for literalism chilling in its effect upon 
every form of art. " Art in photography is possible 
only in an extension of the methods known and in 
the employment of new processes to effect a mani- 
pulation of the photo-image. When the tool is made 
so pliable that it records more than the surface 
appearance of things, when the personal element 
enters to give life to the accurate records, the pre- 
sent limitations of impersonal representation are 
removed from photography, and its large true 
sphere of influence opens." In the treatise before 
us, Mr. Beck has shown, by description and pictorial 
illustration, that if creative work is to enter into 
photography it must be possible to make on the 
negative a line of any character and to control the 
light and shade with the facility of one who paints. 
In fact, his illustrations show that those powerful 
resources of the graphic arts, light lines and dark 
lines, can be made on the negative as readily as on 
paper and canvas. It is interesting to follow the 
divagations of this enthusiastic artist, as he pro- 
pounds the principles and processes that wiU remove 
photography from its limited conventionalities and 
place it among the free arts. The book is worthy 
of perusal by amateur as well as professional photo- 
graphers. 

To people who have not been in 
'^^■delTook!" California, it may seem strange that 

a special book should be needed for 
the would-be gardener in that state. But so peculiar 
is the climate, which is widely varied even within 
the state limits, and the soil, often of several kinds 
and depths on a single ranch, that such a work is 
essential. The well-known volumes on California 



fruits and vegetables, by Professor Wickson, have 
now been followed by one on flowers and orna- 
mental gardening, by Mrs. Belle Sumner Angier. 
" The Garden Book of California " (Paul Elder & 
Co. ) tells many things that the new-comer to 
California, if interested in gardening, will wish to 
know. It presupposes a knowledge of gardening 
in general, and emphasizes those points wherein 
garden operations and conditions on the coast vai-y 
from those existing elsewhere. The introductory 
chapter, however, on the flower-garden as a factor 
in home-making and child-training, is applicable to 
any region. Following this are chapters on simple 
gardening methods, a planting calendar, the culture 
of common plants and bulbs, palms and tropical 
plants, rose-culture in California, ferns and fern- 
eries, the mission of the vine, boundaries, tree- 
planting and protection, insecticides and plant 
diseases, backyard problems, out-of-door living 
rooms, the equipment of the aviary, and native 
trees, flowers, and shrubs. The last chapter is 
necessarily incomplete, and shoidd be supplemented 
by reference to a book on the wild-flowers of the 
coast ; but it is pleasantly suggestive. The book 
contains twenty illustrations from photographs, 
showing numerous typical California scenes, such as 
the palm and the pine as neighbors, a marguerite 
hedge, a rose-bower, an avenue of Eucalypti, and 
charming residences in the Mission style of archi- 
tecture with appropriate garden surroundings. 

A ».„j;.j*„. Ill his "Persecution in the Early 

A new liijni on ^-i . • 

the early Chris- Church, a Chapter in the History of 
tian martyri. Renunciation " (Jennings & Graham) 
Mr. Herbert B. Workman, Principal of Westminster 
School, has set before his readers in a new light the 
relations of Christianity to the Roman Empire in the 
first three centuries of the Christian era, and has 
shown that the persecutions of those times were due 
not so much to a deep-seated intolerance of the new 
religion on the part of the Romans as to the lack of 
wisdom for tempering the zeal of the Christians. 
Regarding self-sacrifice as the highest recognized 
principle of the kingdom of God, and looking upon 
martyrdom as the highest expression of that prin- 
ciple, the early Christians sought it, rather than 
escape from it. To participate in the sufferings of 
the Master was an assm-ance of participation in his 
glory. And instead of making their position in re- 
gard to the kingdoms of this earth clearly understood 
by the Roman authorities, they, consciously or other- 
wise, put themselves in the category of those who 
were disloyal, law-breakers, guilty of l&sh majeste, 
atheists, anarchists, outlaws, and non-conformists to 
the orderly regulations of the Roman Empire ; and 
they chose to suffer the consequences that must in- 
evitably arise. The Cliristians were, furthermore, 
unfortunate in retaining many superstitions, beliefs 
in demons and other supernatural agencies, which 
rendered them liable to penalties imposed by Roman 
law upon the practice of the magical arts. Mr. 
Workman's book is a valuable contribution to the 



1907.]

Taking the tenets of Kai'l Marx as 
a point of departure. Mr. Edward 
Le Rossingnal. in his " Oi-thodos 
Socialism'" (Crowell). presents a critical study of 
the socialistic theory in its most rigid form. The 
doctrines of the English Classical School — the 
corner-stone, as it were, upon which socialism was 
built — are examined and their inconsistences noted. 
A student of socialistic theories as well as an astute 
observer of facts. Mr. Le Rossingnal perceives the 
fallacies of socialism and flagrantly exposes them. 
He shows how the basic principle of Marxian philo- 
sophy — the economic interpretation of history — 
ci-umbles away under Marx's assertion that there 
will be an •' era of perfect peace." Furthermore, 
he sees slight ground for predicting that this social- 
istic era — economically disastrous, as he believes — 
wiU ever be realized. Mr. Le Rossingnal makes his 
points skilfully, but one must bear in mind tliat in his 
small volume he in no way attempts to consider the 
]X)sition of the " opportunists," a large sect of less 
radical socialists. In his pertinent discussion of '' or- 
thodox " socialism, however, he is convincing in his 
conclusion that it is as yet " but a faith, not a science. ** 

How Germany Dr. Earl D. Howard's essay on « The 
ahead to Cause and Extent of the Recent 

indiitiriai waj/«. Industrial Progress of Germany " 
(Houghton) is an attempt to describe and account 
for the recent extraordinary industrial development 
of the German Empire — a development in many 
respects comparable to that of the United States, 
and one which lias enabled Germany to surpass all 
her Continental competitors and excite alarm in 
Great Britain. Until recently the population of 
Gennany was predominantly agricultui-al and 
unprogressive. Her soil is not fertile, and her 
mineral resources have been in a state of rapid 
decline. In spite of these and other drawbacks, 
however, Germany has within the last quarter of a 
centuiy become one of the leading industrial powers 
of the world. One of the most fundamental and 
important causes of the pi-esent prosperity of the 
German nation, says Dr. Howard, is the close rela- 
tionship between science and practical affairs, as a 
result of which German indusby is able to avail 
itself of the technical skiU and knowledge of trained

AN INDISPENSABLE BOOK FOR EVERY READER 



Come of the most notable things which distinguished 
*~^ writers of the nineteenth century have said in praise of 
books and by way of advice as to what books to read are 
here reprinted. Every line has something golden in it. — 
Netv York Times Saturday Revirw. 

A NY one of the ten authors represented would be a safe 
'^ guide, to the extent of the ground that he covers ; but 
the whole ten must include very nearly everything that can 
judiciously be said in regard to the use of books. — Hartford 
Courant. 

'T'HE editor shows rare wisdom and good sense in his selec- 
tions, which are uniformly helpful. — Boston Transcript. 

T^HERE is so much wisdom, so much inspiration, so much 
* that is practical and profitable for every reader in these 
pages, that if the literary impulse were as strong'in us as the 
religious impulse is in some people we would scatter this 
little volume broadcast as a tract. — Neiu York Commercial 
Ad'vertiser.

THE LEADING NATURE BOOK OF THE YEAR 
Professor CHARLES C D. ROBERTS'S 

The Haunters of the Silences 

With 62 illustrations [ 4 reproduced in colors) by Charles Livingston Bull. $2.00. 

" Of all the natare writers he is by far the most channing. the most literaiy, aud the most interesting." — New 
York Saturday Times Revietr. "We swear by the whole Ixjok." — New York Sun. There is always the 
dignity of reality in his animal stories." — Buffalo News. •• He is king in this field of literary achievement. 
His other stories were niotlels, unsnq>as.sed until by his latest work." — Netc Haven Journal. "It remained 
for him to crystallize in a series of vibrant character studies, told with power, insight, and sympathy, the 
salient features of the horizonless life of the animal world." — The Bookman. "Whatever of verbal or 
poetical embroiderj- or picturesque description is woven into the stories only adds to their charm and fasci- 
nation." — Brooklyn Eagle. " Poet Laureate of the animal world, he displaj's the keenest powers of observation 
closely intermingled \vith a fine imaginative discretion. His poetic feeling for nature and the niceties of his 
language rank him as a stj'list of the highest class." — Boston Transcript. " As the Landseer of literature he Ls 
the ideal biographer of the animal world. These are fa.scinating stories of animal life." — Boston Herald. 



New Novels of Interest to be Published in September 
Mr. Robert NeUson Stephens's last romance CLEMENTINA'S HIGHWAYMAN 

With »ix illugtratioitg in color* by Adelaide Everhnrt. $l.oO. 
A dashing, sparkling, vivacious comedy of which the heroine is as lovely and changeable as an .\pril day and the hero all 
ardor and daring. The exquisite quality of Mr. Stephens's literary style clothes the tale in most delicate word-fabric, and 
never before have hie setting and atmosphere been so perfect. 

Mr. Nathan Gallizier's THE SORCERESS OF ROME 

With four drawinr/t in colors bv The Kinnev'. tl.50. 
The author has used the love story of Otto ni. and Stephania as the main theme of the second book of his trilogy of 
romances on the mediseval life of Italy. In detail and finish the story is a brilliant piece of work, even superior in its 
color, absorbing action, and sumptuous word-painting to its predecessor. " Castel del Monte." 

Mr. Edward's H. Hurst's MYSTERY ISLAND 

frontispiece in colon bv Orituald Tva. $1M. 
By the murder of one of their nimiber in a hunting camp on a swampy island in the Florida Everglades the secret of egress 
is lest and the campers find themselves marooned. Cnt off from civilization the conventional veneer is soon worn away, 
and an unusual and difficult plot is developed. The author handles the situation between the men and the woman with 
skill and a fine delicacy. 

Mr. Grover Clay's HESTER OF THE HILLS 

Frontispiece in colon bv (rriswald Tyng. tl-iO. 
This novel will, the publishers believe, cause much discussion. It has a motif which is new both to 
real life and fiction, and which should prove absorbingly interesting to all those who believe in the 
approaching physical and mental freedom of man from inherited tendencies and unnatural laws.

THE UNIVERSITY IDEAL. 



The former president of an American uni- 
versity, speaking last June at eommenoement 
exercises which he had been inritetl to adorn 
with his oratorj% delivered himself of the fol- 
lowing message to his student audience : 

" Keep step with the procession. It is a pretty good 
crowd, and it is generally moving in the right direction. 
Act with a party ; veil for a ticket ; whoop it up for the 

The advice is hardly necessary for the average 
college student, who is only too apt to regulate 
his life by philistine standards. But it offers 
cause for melanchol}- contemplation when we 
ctntiust it with the kind of advice that used to 
be offered upon such academic occasions. We 
have lieen calleil upon of late years to witness 
the replacement of the old-time clerical univer- 
sity president by the president versed in prac- 
tical affairs, and have been expected to applaud 
the change as a sign of progress. Progress in 
some directions it doubtless does indicate, — in the 
management and enlargment of endowments, 
in the efficiency of administrative machinery, 
and in the creation of a general impression of 
bustling prosperity. But it is a prepress that 
may be dearly purchased at the price of dignity, 
or of a weakened consecration to the id«ds of 
which a university should be the visible embodi- 
ment. It is a prt^^ress that may mean, indeed, 
nothing less than a parting of the ways. For 
what can there be in common between the sen- 
timent of the modem vulgarian, as expressed 
in his " whoop it up for the flag," and the sen- 
timent that clings about the " Veritas '* of Har- 
vard and the " Dominus Dluminatio Mea "' of 
Oxford? 

Reverence for truth, concern for the things 
of the spirit, — these are musty old ideals that 
have had their day. Keeping step with the 
procession is evidently the counsel of practical 
wisdom, concerned with the importance of being 
a good fellow, of letting well enoxigh alone, of 
substituting realities for dreams, — all with the 
object of getting through life comfortably. We 
are far beyond the foolish notion of the Shorter 
Catechism respec-ting the chief end of man. It 
is clear as daylight that his chief end is to make 
his " pile." and enjoy it afterwards with what 



80 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



remains to him of eapatdty for enjoyment. An 
Irish moralist much in vogue just at present 
assures us that the man who should lose the 
whole world to gain his own soul woxdd make 
an astonishingly bad bargain ; and the opinion 
receives delighted acclaim. Institutions, no less 
than individuals, are moulded by the pressure 
of current opinion ; and it is not surprising that 
even universities shovdd now and then hearken 
to the counsels of a base opportunism. 

Yet there is an older ideal of university 
influence that it would be well not to forget, 
even when our intellectual life seems most at 
the point of suffocation in the welter of present 
day materialism. It is the ideal formulated 
in severely simple speech by Newman when he 
says : 

" A university training is the great ordinary means to 
a great but ordinary end; it aims at raising the intel- 
lectual tone of society, at cidtivating the public mind, 
at purifying the national taste, at supplying true prin- 
ciples to popular enthusiasm and fixed aims to popular 
aspiration, at giving enlargement and sobriety to the 
ideas of the age, at facilitating the exercise of political 
power, and refining the intercourse of private life." 

It is the ideal embodied in the glowing eloquence 
of Arnold's apostrophe to Oxford : 

" Adorable dreamer, whose heart has been so romantic! 
Who hast pven thyself so prodigally, given thyself to 
ideas and to heroes not mine, only never to the Philis- 
tines ! home of lost causes, and forsaken beliefs, and 
unpopular names, and impossible loyalties ! . . . Appar- 
itions of a day, what is our puny warfare against the 
Philistines, compared with the warfare which this queen 
of romance has been waging against them for centuries, 
and will wage after we are gone." 

The advisability of yelling for a ticket, and of 
whooping it up for the flag is, strangely enough, 
not even hinted at in these expressions of old 
fogyism ; nor is there any suggestion that in 
keeping step with the procession is the sum of 
practical wisdom. Such counsels may win the 
cheap applause of a pack of thoughtless under- 
graduates, but to the serious mind they are of 
melancholy omen. 

The temper that is the product of University 
discipline should, to prove itself worth what it 
has cost, repudiate the very thought of a life 
controlled by impulse and swayed by partisan 
prejudice. These are the forces that have caused 
nearly all the mischief recorded in the annals of 
human history, and the trained intelligence is 
under bonds to oppose a solid front to their men- 
acing array. And so far from its being proper 
for the educated man to keep step ynth the pro- 
cession, it is his most solemn duty to get well in 
axivance of it, and to keep step only with those 
who know what the goal of that procession should 



be. His course should be that desci-ibed with 
a fine sense of responsibility in one of Ibsen's 

letters : 

" I maintain that a tighter in the intellectual vanguard 
caji never collect a majority round him. In ten years 
the majority will, possibly, occupy the standpoint which 
Dr. Stockmann held at the public meetuig. But during 
these ten years the Doctor will not have been standing 
still; he will stiU be at least ten years ahead of the 
majority. As regards myself, at least, I am conscious 
of mcessant progression. At the point where I stood 
when I wrote each of my books, there now stands a 
tolerably compact crowd; but I myself am no longer 
there; I am elsewhere; farther ahead, I hope." 

For the educated man to keep step with the 
procession is for him to abdicate his well-earned 
leadership, to annul the patent of his rank in 
the aristocracy of intellect. 

This aristocracy rules indeed by divine right. 
All others are artificial creations, protected by 
mercenaiy cohorts, and embodying the selfish 
interests of class. This alone, by the very prin- 
ciple of its establishment, by the cachet of its 
honorable distinction, exists for the good of 
humanity, and its titles are secured by an 
indefeasible claim. Nature, no doubt, does 
most to determine what persons shall be the 
proud possessors of these titles ; but it is the 
university (taken as type of all the organized 
instrumentalities of culture) which searches out 
the individuals whom nature has thus marked, 
and transforms mute inglorious Miltons into 
vocal personalities of reno%vn. And once ap- 
proved of this aristocracy, as Ruskin reminds 
us, a man may never become an outcast save by 
his own faidt. It is an aristocracy in which 
responsibility goes hand in hand with privilege, 
and which values the latter chiefly because it 
entails acceptance of the former, and thereby 
makes for the service of mankind. 

The university, in its function as thtis con- 
ceived, does not attempt to " whoop it up " for 
any cause whatever. Not by vociferation, but 
by the refined method of the persuasive reason, 
are its ends attained. It stands aloof from the 
turmoil of the market-place and the contention 
of the arena, not indeed without sympathy, but 
certainly without noisy participation, content 
that its sane and reconciling influence should 
promise to prove effective upon the far-reaching 
future. Other agencies for the elevation of 
thought and conduct may lose their hold upon 
men and lapse into desuetude ; but the univer- 
sity, precisely because it is universal in its nature 
no less than in its name, takmg all knowledge 
and all life for its province, must persevere in 
its beneficent leadership. This obligation is 



1907.] 



THE DTATi 



81 



brought home to us here in America by the 
words of the editor of " The Hibbert Journal," 
who recently paid us a \'isit. He said : 

" I have been greatly struck with the interest shown 
in the higher ethical and religious aspect of things by 
the men who are responsible for the teaching in your 
universities — I mean, of course, men who are not pro- 
fessionally engaged in the service of religion. I believe 
this will have a profound effect on the young men who 
pass through these colleges. I may be wrong, but it 
seems to me that the moral guidance of the nation is com- 
ing rather from the universities than from the churches 
as such." 

There is much to justify this prediction in our 
present-day university acti^-it^-. But it must be 
vmderstood that the moral guidance in question 
wtU not be commensurate with, or very definitely 
related to, the showing we make in material 
equipment, in imijosing educational statistics, 
and in the midtiplication of special schools of 
science. It will be measured in terms of quality 
rather than of quantity", and the spirit in which 
our universities meet the demand upon them 
will provide the real test whereby we may know 
whether they are concerned with substance 
rather than with shadow, with the core of intel- 
lectual endeavor rather than with its outward 
trappings. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The EVOLiTiox of the card catalogue, now 
so generally used in libraries and in many other 
institutions as well, is not so drearily uninterest- 
ing as might at first be expected. It has pre- 
sented some curious phases since the day, long ago. 
before the French Revolution, when a certain abb^ 
conceived the germinal idea and set about index- 
ing his libi-ary by writing the titles on playing- 
cards, one tide to a card, and placing the cards on 
end in alphabetical order in a little tray. From 
this sanctified use of " the devil's picture-book," Mr. 
Seth Hastings Grant, librarian of the New York 
Mercantile Library in the middle of last century, 
advanced to the application of the card-index system 
to the record of books loaned ; and from that, later, 
when he became comptroller of New York, to its 
emplojtuent for business purposes, whereby he 
detected certain frauds practised by some of his 
subordinates. Thereby Mr. Grant attained a sort 
of national renown, and the commercial card-index 
rose rapidly to its present prominence. The latest 
development is a card catalogue for the blind, now 
nearing completion (which is a contradiction in 
terms, as a card catalogue of a growing collection of 
books is never complete) in the department for the 
blind in the New York Public Library. The cards, 
which are larger than the ordinary index cards, are 



inscribed by pricking the entry by the point sys- 
tem, both authors and subjects l>eing indexed. The 
drawers hold these pricked cards in an inverted 
position, so that by running the finger-tips over the 
backs of the cards a blind person may readily de- 
cipher the inscriptions. More than three thousand 
volumes, printed for the blind, and on the library's 
shelves, are thus made conveniently available with 
little aid from attendants.

Cape Ax>f in histoey and liteeatitbe has an 
importance and an interest that receive partial recog- 
nition in the remarkable monument dedicated this 
month at Gloucester. Everj'one knows about the 
Reef of Norman's Woe and the legendary wreck of 
the '" Hesperus " (although the Gloucester fisherfolk 
stoutly aver their belief that there " never was no 
such " a vessel ) immortalized by Longfellow. But 
perhaps not everybody has heard or read of the first 
settlement of Gloucester in 1623, seven years before 
Boston had its beginnings, and its re-settlement 
about ten years later under the fostering care of the ' 
Rev. John "White, of Dorchester, England. It is to 
perpetuate the memory of this founder of what is 
sometimes called " the birthplace of the Massachu- 
setts Bay Colony " that a monster boulder, two hun- 
dred feet long and twenty-seven feet high, has been 
selected to bear the memorial tablet, sixteen feet by 
thirteen, with its sculptured enclosure in bas-relief, — 
the largest bronze, it is said, ever placed in this 
country. According to the programme drawn up 
for the day's festivities. Senator Lodge delivers 
the oration and Mr. Madison Cawein recites the 
poem — about the time that President Roosevelt and 
Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole perform the same parts 
respectively at the other extremity of Massachusetts 
Bay. The artistic part of this undertaking has been 
in charge of Mr. Eric Pape, who is reported to have 
entered grandly into the spirit of the occasion, as 
indeed became a citizen of the Cape. He is a 
summer resident of Annisquam, we believe, and thus 
of course is thoroughly familiar with Cape Ann and 
its legends and history.

The exact meaxing of a curious Southern 
IDIOM, ''you all," and its first-person and third- 
person forms, is pretty well established by Professor 
C. Alphonso Smith, of the University of North 
Carolina, in tlie July " Uncle Remus's Magazine." 
Though " ydu all " (with accent on the you) is some- 
times used in addressing one person only, there is 
a distinct implication that this one person is repre- 
sentative of a group or class. "You dU " (accent 
on the all), in both South and North, means the 
same as ''all of you." Furthermore, Professor 
Smith points out the adjective force of you in "ydn 
'• all," and the prominal part played by all ; whereas 
in "you dll." the parts of speech are reversed. He 
also thinks he finds traces of this idiomatic use of 
•• ydu all " •• in Sliakespeare, the King James version 
of the Bible, and elsewhere in classic English liter-

Brief reference is made to the conjectural derivation 
of the phrase from the French, vous tous, nous tous.

is the French vous autres and nous autres, although 
even here the analogy is far from close. Inciden- 
tally the writer speaks of " there being not the 
slightest difference in meaning or propriety between 
the alternative forms [' you ^11 ' and ' all of you,' 
' we ^11 ' and ' all of us,' ' they itll ' and ' all of 
them ']." A stickler for verbal propriety might 
object that " all of you, of us, of them " is a false 
use of the partitive genitive; there are purists who 
are severe in their condemnation of the phrase. 
Professor Smith has done a service in contributing 
toward a final settlement of a much -discussed 
question. ... 

HoNOKs TO Henley, come somewhat tardily, but 
they have come at last in gratifyingly full measure. 
His bust, recently unveiled at St. Paul's with impres- 
. sive dedicatory exercises, could not have been more 
fittingly placed than in the heart of the city whose 
manifold sights and sounds he celebrated in verse. 
Would that he might have had some foreglimpse of 
this loving tribute when from his bed of pain he was 
writing " Out of the night that covers me, black as 
the pit from pole to pole ! " The poet of the 
" unconquerable soul," it will be remembered, dared 
to speak his mind a few years ago when the memory 
of Stevenson was being deluged with tears of mawk- 
ish sentimentality ; and for this word of manly 
protest he had to face the finger of scorn and suffer 
the false charge of petty malice, of envy, and of 
ingratitude. But the last hiss is now hushed, and in 
London it is the prevalent fashion to style him the 
Walt Whitman of English literature. In a letter 
read at the unveiling, Mr. George Meredith said of 
Henley : " He had the poet's passion for nature, 
and by reason of it the poet's fervent devotion to 
humanity." Peculiarly fitting was it that his bust 
should be from the chisel of Rodin, another indom- 
itable independent, whom Professor Kuno Francke 
has not hesitated to call " the greatest plastic genius 
of our time." , , 

A DECREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR FICTION is, 

rather strangely, indicated in the last annual report 
of the London Library. By the Borough Librarian 
of Holborn this further statement is given out to the 
press : " There is no doubt that the craze for novel- 
reading is dying out. Ten years ago the percentage 
of books delivered to readers in the borough was 
66.1 for works of fiction and 32.9 for historical, 
scientific, and other works. Last year the percentage 
stood at 56.5 for novels and 43.5 for other books. 
This shows conclusively, I think, that readers, so far 
at any rate as this district is concerned, are becoming 
more and more interested in books of a higher 
character and merit than the average contemporary 
novel. This I cannot consider but as a welcome 
cliange in the intellectual taste of the public. Yet, 



strange to say, there is no decline in the demand 
for the works of such classical novelists as Scott, 
Thackeray, Dickens, and George Eliot. Next to 
these, historical works find most favor among our 
readers." It would be interesting to know whether 
this falling-off in novel-reading was a spontaneous, 
or an assisted, perhaps even to some extent a forced, 
diminution. There are subtle ways, known to 
librarians, for discouraging an over-fondness foi' 
current fiction. , . . 

Government recognition of literary worth 
in England has already been approvingly noted 
of late in these columns. To the men and women 
writers in receipt of pensions from the British gov- 
ernment are now to be added the following, who 
have deserved well of their country : Sir F. C. 
Burnand, £200 yearly ; Mr. John Davidson, " in 
consideration of the merits of his poetical works," 
£100 a year ; Miss M. Betham Edwards, £50 annu- 
ally ; Mrs. Florence Maitland, in recognition of 
her late husband's services to law and history, £100 
each year ; Mr. George Howell, for his writings 
upon labor subjects, £50 yearly ; and " Ouida," for 
her services to romance, a pension of £1,50. It is 
pleasant to be thus honored. It is even more than 
pleasant to be able, as was Carlyle, to decline such 
honors. ... 

A well-earned tribute to a veteran editor 
was that lately paid to Mr. Henry M. Alden by the 
college from which he was graduated fifty years 
ago. Rather noteworthy are some of the details of 
the ceremony that made Mr. Alden a doctor of laws 
of Williams College, which had already honored 
itself by making him a doctor of letters. President 
Henry Hopkins, who has, as executive head of the 
college, bestowed this later honor, is the son of 
the famous Mark Hopkins, in the twenty-first year 
of whose presidency of Williams young Alden took 
his baccalaureate degree, one year before the present 
president was graduated from the same college. 
Thus the two college mates came together again — in 
a more amicable relation, it is safe to say, than that 
into which they entered fifty-thi-ee years ago as 
sophomore and freshman, respectively.

A New York state historian whose recent 
appointment by the wisely discriminating Governor 
Hughes will be applauded by the library world is 
Mr. Victor Hugo Paltsits, assistant librarian of the 
Lenox Library since 1893, and bibliographer of 
industry and ability, as proved by his work on the 
" Jesuit Relations " and in other departments of 
early American history. But probably he is better 
and more pleasantly remembered for his expert 
assistance always com'teously tendered to Lenox 
Library visitors of the last two decades ; for it is 
now nearly twenty years since Mr. Paltsits's connec- 
tion with that librai-y began. His departure (pre- 
supposing that he accepts, or has accepted, the new 
appointment) will be regretted.

COMMUNICA TION. 



RECENT LIBRARY PROGRESS IN ALABAMA. 
(To the Editor of The Diai..) 

K paragraph concerning the iibrarj' situation in 
Georgia, in the issue of The Dial for August 1, impels 
me to write this brief uote concemiug recent library 
progress in Alabama. I think your remark that " public 
libraries in the South are almost as rare as \-iolets in 
October "contains a gratuitous reflection on a part of the 
countr>' which, while far from being as forward as other 
sections in this respect, is evidencing at the present time 
most commendable activity. There are many reasons 
why we have not developed fi-ee public libraries in the 
States of the South, notably because of the poverty of 
this section for the last forty years. For the last ten 
years, however, there has been a decided renaissance 
in library work, and our progress during that period is 
quite as advanced as progress elsewhere during the first 
decade of the beginnings of the movement. But I am 
not writing this in a controversial way, and only wish 
you to know that your readers in the South would prefer 
that, after full information, a word of commendation 
for praiseworthy effort be given, rather than criticism 
for a backwardness which, on examination, can be satis- 
factorily explained. 

The library notes that appear in The Dial from 
time to time indicate an interest in the furtherance of 
this phase of educational acti^aty, and I therefore wish 
particularly to call yoiu- attention to one part of the 
programme of the recent AshevUle Conference of the 
American Library Association, held during the latter 
part of May. At that session Miss Anne Wallace, 
librarian of the Carnegie Librarj" of -Atlanta, reviewed 
the history and recent progress of library development 
in the South generally smce 1899, and she was followed 
by representatives of the several Southern States. Her 
address appears in the June issue of "The Library 
Journal," and while not altogether as full as it might 
have been made, I think in the main it b a good review. 

I had the honor to appear for Alabama. While 
Georgia was the first of the States of the South to 
create a State Library Commission, no appropriations 
have as yet been made to carry forward its work. 
Therefore to Alabama belongs the honor of first enter- 



ing upou State-supported librair work in the South. 
At the Spring session of our State Legislature, by act 
of March 5, 1907, the Department of Archives and His- 
tory, of which I am Director, was required to promote 
the organization and development of pubhc and school 
libraries, etc., and to build up a leg^.slative reference col- 
lection. The act is herewith given in fuU, inasmuch as 
it is very short, and particidarly as it further illustrates 
how much can be stated in a general way on a given 
proposition without burdeuiug the statute with details 
wliich are properly left to administrative development. 

" In addition to the duties now required by law. the Depart- 
ment of Archives and History shall do and perfonn the following : 

"l. It shall encourage and assist in the establishment of 
public and school libraries, and in the improvement and 
strengthening of those already in existence ; it shall give advice 
and provide assistance to librarians and library workers in 
library administration, methods, and economy; and it shall 
conduct a system of travelling libraries. 

" 2. It shall bring together and arrange for ready constilta- 
tion a reference collection of materials for the use of the 
members of the legislature. State ofBcers. and others, on all 
sabjects which may. from time to time, be deemed of public 
interest and importance to the people of the State." 

Not to speak now of the development of the division 
of Legislative Reference, the division of Librarj' Exten- 
sion went into operation June 1, its work has been out- 
Uned, and an assistant has been placed in charge. The 
plan of work proposed involves public Ubrary promotion, 
school Ubrary promotion, uistruction and supervision, 
travelling Ubraries, magazine clearing-house, and library 
publication. The activity of the new diraion has already 
been evidenced from the fact that I have secured the 
incorporation of the following section in the municipal 
code, only adopted in the hjst few days by the late 
Summer session of our State Legislature: 

■■ Sec. 178. Cities and towns shall have the right to establish 
and maintain, or aid in establishing or maintaining, public 
libraries, either separately or in connection with the public 
schools." 

I think you wiU agree witii me that the adoption of this 
section puts beyond peradventure the development of 
free pubhc hbraries in Alabama. Their establishment 
now only depends upon the amount of inspirational work 
which the new division of Library Extension can do. 

Before closing, I desire to say that we have in 
Alabama more than a himdred free public and institu- 
tional hbraries, of which eleven are Carnegie hbraries. 
Three of the latter are, however, school Ubraries. I 
might further add that our Legislature of 1907 has made 
possible, by adequate appropriations, the erection of sepa- 
rate library buildings at our State University and also at 
our Polytechnic Institute, to cost in each case over fifty 
thousand doUars. News has just been received that 
our State Girls' School, at Montevallo, has elevated its 
library to a separate department, with a trained Ubrarian 
in charge; as has also been done by our Jacksonville 
State Normal School. The new division of library 
Extension will conduct a summer school for the prelim- 
inary training of Ubrariaus, beginning next siunmer. I 
ought also to add that we liave a State Library Associ- 
ation, organized in 1904, which has held three annual 
meetings, and is doing good work, with a membership 
of over seventy-five. All in all, our progress is indeed 
considerable ; and I liave written thus at length in order 
that the facts may be known to your readers. I doubt 
not that you will be as much gratified as anyone else.

Men axd Max neks of French 
Revolutionary Days.* 

A volume of lively memoirs, written by a 
gifted Frenchwoman to divert her thoughts from 
personal sorrows, and left lying in manuscript 
for the better part of a century, is now, after 
all fear of hurting the feelings of any persons 
concerned is past, brought out in both French 
and English and offered to a public almost as 
greedy of this kind of light literature as it is of 
fiction. The Comtesse de Boigne does not claim 
for her book any historical importance, nor does 
she strive for accuracy in matters of fact ; but 
with running pen she records chiefly her mem- 
ories and impressions of persons, mostly persons 
of note, whom the curious reader cannot look 
at from too many points of view, and who are 
here handled with that quick and pitiless pene- 
tration that makes many women and all children 
at once a terror and a delight to those aroimd 
them. 

Charlotte Louise Eleonore Adelaide d'Os- 
mond (1781-1866), daughter of the Marquis 
d'Osmond, a military man, a courtier, a diplo- 
mat, and a stanch royalist to the end, owed to 
the turbulent times in which her youth was cast 
her early experience of life in several lands and 
her wide acquaintance with notable characters 
of many sorts. Some of her most interesting 
memories go back to her sojourn in England, 
where her family for several years lived as 
emigres. It was in London that the young 
Comtesse's charms attracted the notice of Gen- 
eral de Boigne (known in earlier life as Benoit 
Leborgne, the son of a furrier), who, though 
nearly three times her age, succeeded in win- 
ning her hand in marriage. But there was no 
love lost on either side : he admired her beauty 
and valued her high birth, and she desired his 
wealth, which had been amassed in India, to 
relieve the necessities of her family. In accept- 
ing him she yielded to the generous impidse of 
a girl of seventeen ; and if she never regretted 
her act of self-sacrifice, it was not because her 
ill-bred husband gave her no cause. He died 
in 1830, leaving her a fortune to enjoy for 
thirty-six comparatively serene years after her 
thirty-two troubled years of matrimony. It was 
a union unblessed by offspring, and at her death 
her grand-nephew, the then Marquis d'Osmond,

Scribner's Sons. 



was made her chief heir and her literary ex- 
ecutor. At his decease, not many years ago, his 
intimate friend, Charles Nicoulland, became re- 
sponsible for the disposition of the Comtesse de 
Boigne's memoirs, which are now made public. 
A few passages, descriptive of persons and 
manners, will be quoted, as much more inter- 
esting than any labored synopsis of what the 
author's lively pages contain. And first of aU 
a brief reference to the writer herself in her 
childhood will be in order. She appears, even 
as an infant, to have possessed unusual accom- 
plishments. 

" I was brought up literally upon the knees of the 
royal family. Tlie King and Queen especially over- 
whelmed me with kindness. . . . My father had taken 
pains to develop my intelligence, and I was honestly 
regarded as a little prodigy. I had learnt to read with 
such facility that at the age of three I could read and 
repeat the tragedies of Racine for my own pleasure, 
and, it i.s said, for the pleasure of others." 

Some years later, when she was in her 'teens, 
we find her reatling Adam Smith's " Wealth of 
Nations " as a pastime, for which she was well 
laughed at by her friends. 

Respecting the peculiar etiquette of French 
society shortly before the Revolution, the 
Comtesse writes : 

" The social tone was so free that my mother [a 
Worcestershire woman] has told me tliat she was often 
embarrassed to the point of tears. During the first years 
of her marriage the sarcasms and jests to which she was 
exposed often made her very imhappy. . . . An old grand 
vieaire, who happened to be in the midst of this cheer- 
ful company, seeing her very sad one day, remarked: 
' Marquise, do not worry ; one of your faults is your 
beauty, but that will be pardoned. But if you wish to 
live peaceably, take more pains to conceal your love for 
your husband; it is the one kind of love which is not 
tolerated here.' . . . On the whole if the language 
of this society was free, its actions were extremely 
restrained. A man who placed his hand on the arm of 
a chair occupied by a lady would have been considered 
excessively rude. Only the greatest intimacy coidd 
justify a walk arm in arm, and that was imusual, even 
in the country. Gentlemen never offered their arms or 
their hands to take a lady in to diimer, and a man would 
never have sat down on a sofa together with a lady ; but 
language, on the other hand, was free to the point of 
licentiousness." 

The descriptions of prominent persons of the 
time are numerous and good. Even to name 
all the great with whom the writer mingled and 
whom she has thus sketched, would take too 
long. As a specimen of her art, here is a 
realistic picture of Mme. de Stael : 

" At first she seemed to me ugly and ridiculous. A 
big red face, a complexion by no means fresh, and her 
hair arranged in a manner which she called picturesque, 
in other words, badly done; no fichu, a white muslin 
blouse, out very low, arms and shoulders bare, no shawl,

scarf, or veil of any kind — snch was the stnmge appa- 
rition which appeared in a hotel room at mid-dav. She ^ 
held a small twig, which she was constantly twiddling 
in her fillers, with the object, I think, of showing off a 
Tcty besatiful hand, tho^fa it was bat the finishing 
toueh to the eceentricitr of her eostnme. At the end 
of an hoar I was entirelT under her charm.*' 

Admiration for the beautiful and virtuous 
Comtesse is increased by reading what she had 
to endure from the coarseness and brutality of 
her husband. 

"The rapidity with which he had passed from the 
lowest rank to the position of commander-in-chief and 
from povertv to vast wealth had never permitted him to j 
acquire any social polish, and the balnts of polite society 
were entirelv unknown to him. An illness from which 
he was recovering had forced him to make an immoderate 
nse of <^iimi, which had paralyzed his moral and physical 
jiowera. Tears of life in India had added the fall force 
of Orieotal jealousy to that which woold naturally arise 
in the mind of a man of his age; in addition to this he 
was endowed with the mast diaagieeaUe character that ; 
Providence ever granted to man. He wiriied to arouse 
dislike a^ others wished to please. He was anxioas to 
make every one feel the domination of his great wealUi, i 
and he thought that the only mode of malm^aaii npres - I 
$doD was to hurt the feelings of otlKr people. Heinsalted 
his servants, he offended his giteate, and his wife was 
a fortiori, a victim to this grievous &alt of character." 

The first beginnings of sea-bathing in France 
are incidentally described by the author. This 
cure for headaches and other ailments she had 
found successful in England, and in the summer 
of 1806 she detennined to trj- the same at 
Dieppe. 

"As for the cHHnforts arranged for the convenience 
of bathers which Dieppe has since organised, they were 
non-existent at that time. My brother was able to find 
a little covered cart, and with great trouble and great 
expense, notwithstanding the universal poverty, a man 
was hired to lead the hones down to the sea, and two 
women to go into the sea with me. These preparations 
raised the public cariosity to such a pitch that my first 
hadies were watched by' a crowd on the shore. My 
servants were asked if I had been bitten by a mad dog. 
I aroused extreme pity as I went by, and it was thought 
that I was being taken to be drowned. An old gentle- 
man called on my &ther to point out to him that he was 
aasoming a great responsibility in permitting so lash an 
act. It can hardly be imagined that the inhabitants of ' 
a seashore should be so afraid of the sea. Bnt at that ' 
time the people of Dieppe were chietly occupied in keep- 
ing out of sight of it stud in protecting themselves from 
the disasters which they feared the sea might Mng, i 
so that it was for them nothing more than a means of ' 
annoyanee and suffering. It is carious to think that 
ten yeais later bathers were arriving in hondreds, that 
special arrangements were made for their convenience, 
and that sea-bathing of every kind went on without 
producing any astonishment in the neighborhood. I 
have thus attempted to point out that the costom of 
sea-bathing, whi(^ is now so universal, is comparatively 
r««ent in France, for Dieppe was the fint place where 
it began." 

The memoirs cover onlv the first thirty-three 



years of the writer's life, leaving more than half 
a century of varied and rich experience unre- 
lated. Bat doubtless her earlier impressions had 
a vividness and charm at the time she recorded 
them (many years before her death ) that would 
not have attached to her later memories, and 
the revolutionary and Napoleonic period is more 
interesting to most readers than the less eventful 
subsequent decades. A useful device has been 
employed by the editor to indicate the extent 
of his excisions. Dots, equal in number to the 
words suppressed, appear in a few places, and 
show the omissions to be infrequent and brief. 
A number of illustrative letters have been added 
in an appendix, and a six-page index concludes 
the whole. A delicate frontispiece portrait pre- 
p ooncaocs the reader in the Comtesse's favor. 
The translator, modestly anonymous, has suc- 
ceeded in giving to his version the agreeable 
efiEect of an original work.

The P.^^ssixg of Korea-* 



Certain fimdamental changes which are com- 
ing about as results of the late war in the Far 
East are described with insight and vigor by Mr. 
Homer B. Hulbert in his latest book, •• The 
Passing of Korea." Mr. Hulbert has been for 
many years a resident of Korea and editor of 
•• The Korean Review," and it may be doubted 
whether any other man is so well qualified to 
give the world a trustworthy portrayal of Korean 
civilization. In him the Koreans have a warm, 
though discriminating, friend ; and we are given 
frankly to understand that the present Ixx^ 
has been wTitten with the purpose primarily of 
"■interesting the reading public in a cotmtry 
and a people that have been frequently maligned 
and seldom appreciated." 

Country and people are therefore described 
in all their more, important aspects, and with 
much detail : and there is. besides, a good deal 
of history- — some ten or twelve chapters con- 
densed from the author's previously published 
" History of Korea." Both history and descrip- 
tion are well done, but for most readers doubt- 
less the chief interest in Mr. Hulbert's book will 
coitre about its discussion of the future of Korea 
as an integral part of the new Japanese Empire. 

The ineWtable absorption of Korea by Japan, 
which was merely legalized by the Treaty of 
Portsmouth, is regarded by Mr. Hidbert as.

[August 16, 



from the Korean standpoint, a genuine calamity. 
The reasons for his view are interesting. They 
are two-fold : the agreeable and jiromising char- 
acter of the Korean people, and the external and 
ai-tificial nature of Japan's alleged modern civil- 
ization. " The Koreans," says the author, " ai-e 
overshadowed by China on the one liand in 
respect of numbers, and by Japan on the other 
in respect of wit. They are neither good mer- 
chants like the one nor gootl fighters like the 
other, and yet they are far more like Anglo- 
Saxons in tempei-ament than either, and they 
are by far the pleasantest people in the Far 
East to live among-st." If the Korean appears 
unthrifty, happy-go-lucky, and narrow-minded, 
he is so, in Mr. Hidbert's opinion, not because 
these ai-e his intrinsic characteristics, but only 
because he has had to bear for a thousand years 
the incubus of Chinese civilization, without being 
allowed an opportunity to develop his capacities 
independently and naturally. It is his environ- 
ment that has been at fault, rather than his 
natural endowments. Rational conservatism, 
generosity, hospitality, personal pride — these are 
some of the good qualities wliich have not been 
crushed out of him. His veracity and business 
honesty are at least up to the best standards 
of the Orient, and the same thing, if nothing 
l>etter, can be said for his personal morals. 

On the whole, the Koreans are not so exce}> 
tional a people that their absorption by a more 
powerful nation would be a cause for general 
regret, provided the absorbing nation were able 
to guarantee the extension of a civilization fun- 
damentally superior. Bvit this is a guarantee 
which Mr. Hulbert firmly believes Japan is 
unable to give. In these days of universal and 
more or less indiscriminate laudation of Japan 
and everything Jajjanese, it is perhaps whole- 
some to have such an incisive, even if somewhat 
overdrawn, presentation of the weaknesses and 
dangers of contemporary Japanese culture and 
influence. In a succession of pungent para- 
graphs, Mr. Hulbert has sought mercilessly to 
strip the glamour from Japanese progress dur- 
ing the past half century. The national meta^ 
morphosis which has challenged the attention of 
the world is declared by him to have been, with 
very few exceptions, a thoroughly selfish move- 
ment, conceived in the interests of class dis- 
tinction and propagated with anything but an 
altruistic motive. "When he [the Japanese] 
adopted Western methods, it was in a purely 
utilitarian spirit. He gave no thought to the 
principles on which our civilization is based. It 
was the finished product he was after and not the 



process. Everything goes to prove that Japan, 
insteatl of digging until she struck the spring 
of Western culture, merely built a cistern in 
which she stored up some of its more obvious and 
tangible results." The bearing of this upon the 
future of the Koreans constitutes Mr. Hulbert's 
second reason why Korea's absorption by Japan 
is a misfortune. " Herein," he says, " lies the 
pathos of Korea's ]X)sition : lying as she does 
in the grip of Japan, she cannot gain from that 
power more than that power is capable of giving 
— nothing more than the garments of the West. 
She may learn science and the industrial arts, 
but she will use them only as a parrot uses 
human speech." Waiving the question as to 
whether Occidental civilization can be taken over 
by an Oriental people in any other fashion than 
as the Japanese have taken it, the point which 
Mr. Hulbert makes seems to have much weight. 
At any rate, the American who in these days 
of rapid transition in the East, and notably in 
Korea itself, is desirous of having put before 
him a view of things which is quite out of the 
conventional, cannot do better than read Mr. 
Hulbert's book. 

Among chapters purely descriptive of the 
Koreans, the best are those dealing with their 
industries, their literature and folk-lore, their 
art, and their religion and superstitions. The 
volume is copiously illustrated with tinted repro- 
ductions of photographs taken by the author. 
These could scarcely be improved, and, indeed, 
mechanically the book is in every respect a model.

Woman and Her Position 
from homer to methodius.' 

" A true conception of woman's ideal life can 
be reached only by the long experience of the 
ages." This rather self-evident truth has been 
so culpably neglected by self-confidenb issuers of 
sweeping and final verdicts about woman that it 
wiU bear insistent iteration. Even the most 
backward human representative of the " happy 
afterthought," — for that according to the hardy 
biologist is the place of the male element in 
nature, — must welcome the current appreciation 
of his anterior and superior mate ; he must value 
highly every continbution to a knowledge of her 
nature, her history, or her rights ; he must 
acclaim every forward step in her emancipation ; 
but withal he must feel that upon no other theme

has the last det-atle produced quite so much 
written trash. The delving anthropologist is 
certainly quite right in enlarging upon the matri- 
archate among primitive peoples : and the latest 
critic of things American may be right when he 
insists that intellectually we are under a gyneco- 
cracy. It does not therefore follow that Mars 
is inhabited, or that the Millennium will burst 
upon us when the " happy afterthought " returns 
to his primal inferiority. It is surely time to 
cease uttering haphazard conclusions or fleeting 
dreams as reasoned and abiding truth. We need 
definite historical studies on essential phases of 
the problem in significant periods. 

Manifestly, one such period is formed bj' the 
centuries that saw the transition of the Greek 
and Roman world from paganism to Chris- 
tianity. It is remarkable how the cataclysmic 
interpretation of hLstorj' has persisted in so many 
treatments of the position of woman during 
this epoch ; and the concomitant niLsconceptions 
have been not less harmful than unptanlonable. 
Xausicaa of the white arms, Asjiasia of the 
unspeakable charm, the giftetl and noble 
Ojmelia. the pagan mart}T Arria, and the 
Christian martyr Blandina. may seem a strange 
group ; yet they must lie studied together if 
we are to deal intelligently with the historical 
aspects of our pi-oblem. 

From the Homeric poems one can draw only 
a pleasant picture of woman and her position, 
even when the disagreeable elements have been 
given all possible prominence. The civilization 
depicted was high but young : and even the 
Greeks, favorites of the gods though they were, 
coiUd not escape the laws of development. If 
more writers had borne this in mind we should 
have been burdened with fewer apologies for 
the existence of concubinage and some kindred 
customs. In any event, the Homeric concubine, 
who might be the mother of well-beloved chil- 
dren, was appreciably higher in the scale of 
humanity than the modem sterile femme entre- 
tenue. Probably, too, she was quite as happy. 
Withal, the Homeric Greeks had arrived at 
monogamy based on affection, and were capable 
of high and glowing devotion. That senti- 
mental passion, in our modem sense, had a real 
existence, it would be hartl to prove ; but true 
marital affection has seldom been as highly 
prized as among these restless tribes. And in 
this connection a dictum of Gibbon is woi-th 
recalling : " The refinements of life corrupt 
while they polish the intercourse of the sexes. 
The gross appetite of love becomes most danger- 
ous when it is elevated, or rather disguised, by 



sentimental pa-ssion." When future ages have 
grown weary of mati-imonial discussions in tome 
after tome, they wUl tiu^ with joy that is ever 
fresh to the pictiii-es of Hector and Andromache, 
of Penelope and her wandering lord. To the 
womanhood of the poems we may apply the 
wokIs of the poet himself about the fair lady 
of Ithaca : " The fame of her virtue wdll never 
perish, but the immortals will make a gracious 
sons in the ears of men on earth to the fame of 
the constant Penelope." K woman is honored 
as a wife and revered as a mother, if she lives 
in an atmosphere of mildness, if she is happy and 
healthful, most of her crying wrongs be«ome 
significantly insignificant. And inasmuch as this 
is fairly true of the Homeric woman, it would 
seem that there is not much of a woman question. 
In later Greece the sky is not so unclouded. 
At Athens, for instance, in the second half of 
the fifth century B. c, the citizen woman — so 
we are always told — was a dutiful nonentity, 
and the charm of female society was sought 
from the flowers of delight known as " hetaine " 
or companions. Unfortimately. one may dis- 
coimt the least reliable evidence and still find 
an ugly balance of truth in the current con- 
ception. However, as to the traditional complete 
submissiveness of the " dutiful nonentity " and 
the utter wretchedness of her lot, your reviewer 
is decidedly skeptical. A little weighing of this 
anecdote and that, a careful reading of Euripides 
and Aristophanes, with an occasional peering 
between the lines, would seem to show that 
Athenian wives hatl almost American wills and 
even ultra- American resourcefulness. Likewise 
a few general considerations would suggest con- 
clusions rather at variance with accepted views. 
By way of example, one might ask how it could 
come to pass that Aspasia and so many others 
of her profession should have incomparable 
brilliance, and at the same time not a single 
respectable woman should manifest a glimmer of 
brightness. Or again, is it quite probable that 
utterly stupid women were the mothers of all the 
men of genius that made the Periclean period 
the envy of its most enlightened successors ? 
Indeed, Ein-ipides insists on the cleverness of 
the softer sex : and clever women have never 
lacked effective methods of exercising influence 
or ameliorating their condition. Taking it all 
in all, we may safely conclude that Athenian 
women in the golden age were something more 
than dutifid nonentities ; and one could even 
adduce considei-able evidence to show the exist- 
ence of a woman "s movement of no contemptible 
proportions.

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



When we transfer our observations to pagan 
Rome, we find an exceptional opportunity to 
follow the emancipation of woman in its rela- 
tion to economic influences. The wife in the 
struggling town on the hUls by the Tiber became 
a different woman in the city that ruled aU Italy, 
and she in turn became a third woman when 
Rome rose to be the opident domina orhis ter- 
rarum. In this last period the matron and her 
daughter achieved a degi-ee of freedom that has 
only been regained in i-ecent years. Of these 
centuries the average person has a most thorough 
misconception, partly because of the tendency in 
human nature to dwell upon the striking side of 
things, partly because " it has been the delight of 
writers who wish to demonstrate the superiority 
of Christianity to heathenism, to bring into 
special prominence the supposed vices and 
humiliations of pagan women." 

Herewith we are brought to Christianity, and 
the most important part of the book we are 
considering. The early church is a field in 
wliich Principal Donaldson has worked long 
and patiently. Furthermore, he has reached the 
age of sober and mature judgment, and he is 
apparently able to doff the prejudice that so 
often mars the treatments of our subject in 
this period. Accordingly his conclusions seem 
eminently worthy of respect, and we may quote 
a central paragraph. 

" At the time when Christianity dawned on the world, 
woman had attained . . . great freedom, power, and 
influence in the Roman Empire. Tradition was in favor 
of restriction, but by a concurrence of circumstances 
women had been liberated from the enslaving fetters of 
the old legal forms, and they enjoyed freedom of inter- 
course in society; they walked and drove in the public 
thoroughfares with veils that did not conceal their faces, 
they dined in the company of men, they studied liter- 
ature and philosophy, they took part in political move- 
ments, they were allowed to defend their own cases if 
they liked, and they helped their husbands ui the govern- 
ment of provinces and in the writing of books. One 
would have imagined that Christianity would have 
favoured the ertensiou of woman's freedom. For 
ChiTstianity itself wa-s one of the most daring revolu- 
tions which the world has ever seen. It defied all past 
customs, it aimed at the overthrow of the religions of 
the world, it overleapt the barriers of nationality, and 
it desired to fuse all mankind into one family and one 
faith. Necessarily, such a movement was aecompauied 
by much excitement and agitation; but when enthusiasm 
sways any association of men, and they live in a state 
of ferment, they break in pieces the bonds of custom — 
those very bonds which most firmly chain women down 
to a slavish position of ivutine. Accordingly, at the 
very first stage women take a prominent part in the 
spread of Christianity and all the activities of Christians. 
But in a short time this state of matters ceases in the 
Church, and women are seen only in two Qapaoities — 
as martyrs and iis deaconesses." 



The degradation was rapid. It is not long 
before TertuUian speaks of wives as " women of 
the second degree of modesty, who have fallen 
into wedlock "; and Clement of Alexandria not 
only regards birth as the entry upon a bitter 
road of life, with the gi'ave as the wayfarer's 
inn, but holds the mother responsible for this 
beginning of woe. It was a terrible age, when 
those who lived nearest to their ideals left the 
fewest children. Our author might have pointed 
out that these phenomena were pretty closely 
connected with the early Christian belief in the 
proximate ending of the world, — not a vague 
figurative transition, but a literal, terrible crash- 
ing of earth's old bones. With this belief 
keenly operative, the male Chi-istian was bound 
to regard his female comrade as a source of 
imhappiness and dire temptation. Woman was 
the devil's gateway. It was inevitable, then, 
that she shoiUd be treated with all possible 
contumely ; and her position needs no comment. 

Strictly, this notice need go no further ; 
but we may be pardoned foi- insisting that the 
progress of woman has been simply a phase of 
our general forward movement. We may prate 
of Teutonic influence and church influence as 
we will ; the fact remains that the Renaissance, 
with its intellectual awakening, was tremen- 
dously important in this field as in so many 
others. As man's mind developed, it was a 
matter of course that a new attitude toward 
woman should come into being. To assign this 
change to Teutonic or Christian influence is to 
lose one's historical perspective. We return 
to another phase of the thought with which we 
began : " A true conception of woman's ideal 
life can be reached only by the long experience 
of the ages." 

In the volume before us. Principal Donaldson 
has reprinted several articles from the " Con- 
temporary Review "; but they have been care- 
fully revised as well as considerably augmented. 
To these he has added a supplementary section 
of sixty-three pages containing notes that are 
interesting and important. Herein the brief 
chapter on " Women in Egypt " is perhaps the 
most deser\'ing of attention, particularly for its 
utilization of recently discovered papyri. An 
actual maiTiage contract dating from 92 B. c. 
is evidence of the sort that replaces most 
acceptably almost any number of controversial 
allegations. After this supplementary book 
comes a bibliography, which is all the more ser- 
viceable for daring to be incomplete. There is 
also an adequate index. 

We conclude by recording the impression of

sanity and clarity produced alike by the first 
and the second reading of this modest work. 
Occasional!}- we might quarrel about a nuance of 
interpretation or of presentation. For instance, 
in dealing with Homeric davs there is surely an 
undulj' modem connotation when a writer speaks 
of the captive woman's becoming the mistj-ess of 
her husband's conqueror. Again, in the chap- 
ter on " Athenian Women " we read : " This 
state of matters had a |K)werful effect on their 
wives. Many of them consoled themselves in 
their loneliness with copious draughts of un- 
mixed wine." It is true that we do hear of 
resort to this source of comfort; but the state- 
ment as it stands is a little too suggestive of a' 
prevalent custom. Aristophanic merriment is 
not to be taken too seriously. However, a 
continuation of these criticisms of scattered 
points woidd only emphasize the pleasing gen- 
eral impression of carefidness and soimd work- 
manship. The essential parts are readable and 
instructive ; the whole is valuable.

The Fall of Xapoleox.* 



The student of the Napoleonic period may 
be a little mystified on discovering that he is 
deeplj- touched by a simple narrative of the 
transfer of Napoleon's body from St. Helena to 
France, of words spoken or acts of homage as 
the body was raised from its resting-place in 
the Valley of Silence, and, after a long voyage, 
given a splendid tomb in The Invalides. The 
reason for this feeling is not to be sought in 
things said or done. These were fitting, but 
the}' do not create the feeling, they only serve 
it ; at most they oft'er an opportunity to receive 
an impression of the greatness of a career set in 
relief against a background of exile and death. 
And all this is in spite of the fact that most 
persons cannot study carefidly Napoleon's later 
career without being con\nnced that he had 
come to use his power for evil ends, and that 
his overthi'ow was neces.sary to the welfare not 
only of Europe but even of France. The con- 
trast between this conviction and the feeling

stimulated by this apotheosis has its counterpart 
in one of the incidents related in a little book 
that has provoked these reflections, " Napoleon : 
The Return from Saint Helena." The author, 
Mr. Phyfe, says that as the vessel bearing Napo- 
leon's body ascended the Seine from Rouen, 
" Aged pea-sants were seen discharging anti- 
quated firearms in salute, or weeping in sUence 
as their hero passed by." Although many of 
these may have been, as Mr. Phyfe suggests, 
veterans of the Grand Army, no class had suf- 
fered more from the sins of Napoleon's later 
years than the peasants. These sufferings they 
had forgotten ; but they remembered the epic 
experiences which some of them had had, and 
the glory that had covered France. Every 
great adventurer finds his best ally in the imag- 
inations of his dupes. 

There are still students, even outside France, 
who cannot think evil of Napoleon. One of 
these is Mr. Oscar Browning, whose book on 
"The Youth of Napoleon," reviewed in these 
columns several months ago, showed, like the 
present volume on "The Fall of Napoleon," an 
attitude of unqualified admiration. This atti- 
tude does not lead Mr. Browning to cover up 
facts which others regard as damaging, but 
simply to look at them from another point of 
view. He al.so relates quite impassively many 
incidents which prove that Napoleon, in 1813, 
1814, and 1815, had become unpopular locally. 
The first third of the volume is taken up with 
an account of the wars and diplomacy of 1813 
and 1814, and impresses one mainly as being a 
spirited resume, subject, however, to reserves 
touching interpretations of diplomatic policies. 
The narrative gains in interest after this pre- 
liminary work is done and attention is concen- 
trated upon Napoleon himself, his conduct, and 
the strange vicissitudes of his fortune during 
the months which followed the first abdication. 
Here the groxmd is not bristling with contro- 
versy, and, through the labors of French writers 
like Houssaye and Masson, a good deal of fresh 
material is available. One noticeable feature 
of Mr. Browning's work is the sense of propor- 
tion which he has maintained throughout his 
treatment of these singularly troubled years. 
If he has ever wished to linger over the details 
of some favorite incident or theme, he has re- 
sisted the temptation. 

In studpng the diplomatic situation, particu- 
larly that of 1813, Mr. Browning has closely 
followed the late Albert Sorel. In his preface 
he makes this one of the chief merits of his 
book. It is unfortunate that for this very period 



90 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



M. Sorel's work supports a brilliant but not 
impartial interpretation of the changing attitude 
of the Allies, and especially of Austria under 
the guidance of Metternich. Too completely 
persuaded by M. Sorel's arguments, Mr. 
Browning calls Metternich's plans an " infa- 
mous plot." His theory is that Metternich's 
propositions were simply a lure, by which 
Napoleon was to be drawn into a negotiation, 
and put at a disadvantage from which he was not 
to extricate himself untU he had been stripped 
of honor and provinces and driven back within 
the ancient boimdaries of France. He believes 
with Sorel that the convention made by Austria 
with Russia and Prussia at Reichenbach in Jime, 
taken in connection with a convention between 
England and Russia earlier in the montli and 
the treaty of Kalisch between Prussia and 
Russia in February, bound Metternich to the 
extreme terms which England wished to make. 
The comparatively moderate terms wliich 
Metternich proposed to Napoleon through 
Count Bubna, or which had been suggested by 
his own conversations with Narbonne, had not 
the purpose, therefore, of offering a basis for 
peace, but were intended merely to conunit 
Napoleon to the policy of retreat, to start him 
" on the rmi "as it were. Once entered on the 
road of concession, he was not to be allowed 
to pause, as harsher and harsher terms were 
revealed, until the veil was finally torn aside 
and he. found himself humiliated, face to face 
with his inexorable antagonist, forced to accept 
an " English " peace. Such a theory does not 
take sufficient account of the distinct policy 
which Austria had followed in 1812 and was 
following again in 1813, and which became fully 
developed as Metternich recognized in the happy 
situation of events the possibility of recovei'ing 
her ancient prestige and territory upon the ruins 
of which the Grand Empire had been founded. 
If Mr. Browning did not lay so much emphasis 
on this feature of his book, it would be a mis- 
take to do it here ; but the reader should be on 
his guard against accepting as proved a thesis 
so doubtful. 

In reading an account of the campaign of 
1813, one's mind goes back naturally to the 
earlier struggle with Prussia and Russia, when 
Jena and Friedland were followed up in a 
manner so different from that of Liitzen and 
Bautzen. The comparison is all the easier 
because of Mr. Petre's republication, in a third 
edition, of " Napoleon's Campaign in Poland," 
and of the appearance of his new volume on 
^ Napoleon's Conquest of Prussia." The con- 



trast is not so nmch in the capacity of the man 
at the two periods as in the resources which he 
had at his disposal and the way in which he had 
organized them. Nearly half of the new volume 
is filled with a detailed description of the relent- 
less pursuit of the fragments of the Prussian 
army after Jena. Of the two principal battles, 
Jena and Auerstiitlt, the description of Auer- 
stadt seems clearer and more interesting. The 
photographs of the field of Jena, to which Mr. 
Petre seems to attach some importance, con- 
fuse the impression of the layman, especially 
when studied in connection with the map which 
exhibits the contour of the country. The most 
instructive passage of the book is the description 
of Napoleon's army atlministration in the field 
and of the loose and ineffective organization of 
the Prussian staff. In the crisis of a campaign, 
the element of time is vital ; and it was by util- 
izing this better than did his opponents, as well 
as because of their mistakes, that these victories 
were won. The two volumes by Mr. Petre 
show Napoleon's military atlniinistration and 
campaign management at the height of his 
power, when it was used to complete the edifice 
of the Gi-and Empire ; and Mr. Browning's 
book, read discreetly, furnishes a clear account 
of the rum of this Empire while its creator was 
playing the game of its defence with a gambler's 
recklessness. Henbt E. Boukne.

lection into a volume of many scattered pieces of 
verse, the whole being entitled '* Said the Rose, and 
Other Lyrics." Although "Christine, and Other 
Poems," an earlier volume, was published during 
the poet's lifetime, and dieted praise from such men 
as Holmes, the author is practically unknown to our 
day. and his name appeals neither in Mr. Stedman's 
" American Anthologj' " nor in tl>e standard histories 
of our literature. Reading the fifty pages of Mr. 
Collins's appreciative essay, we learn anew the lesson 
of fame's caprice, for we become ac({uainted with a 
writer of admirable qualities, whose performance 
certainly deserved something less than the entire 
forgetfulness that seems to have become its portion. 
The titidar lyric is the plaint of a rose, plucked by a 
lady to wear upon her bosom for an hour, and then 
east ruthlessly away. 

'* How the jealous garden gloried 

In my fall ! 
How the honeysuckles chid me. 
How the sneering jasmins bid me 
Light the long, gray grass that hid me 

Like a pall. 

'• There 1 lay beneath her window- 
In a swoon. 
Till the earthworm oer me trailing 
Woke me just at twilight's fuling. 
As the whip-poor-will was wailing 
To the moon. 

'■ But I hear the storm-winds stirriagf 

In their lair : 
And I know they soon will lift me 
In their giant arms and sift me 
Into ashes as they drift me 

Through the air. 

'■ So I pray them in their mercy 

Just to take 
From my heart of hearts or near it 
The last living leaf, and bear it 
To her feet, and bid her wear it 

For my sake." 

These are the last four of the fourteen charming 
stanzas. A number of the poems in tliis volume are 
impressions of Italy, piarticnlarly of Italian art, and 
the influence of Browning is veiy e\'ident. Here is 
the striking close of the lines on the Sistine Madonna : 

■' Sir. "tis strange ; 
That wondrous Virgin face, which Raphael plucked 
From his vast soul four centuries ago. 
Is breathing now, — not in his Italy — 
Bnt on the shores where then first flashed the sail 
Of Genoa's ocean Pilot. Years ago. 
We met mid-heav'n, like drops of summer rain. 
Then, falling, parted I — But — observe the picture : 
Am I not right ? — There — just before them bums. 
Viewless to us, the unveiled Omnipotent. 
Yet, somehow, critics fail to see. or say this." 

How easily that defective last line might have been 
changed to its advantage. 

■■ Yet this, somehow, the critics fail to see." 
A poem of a very different sort is the " Aladdin's 
Palace," written for the semi-centenary of the 
Catholic college wnth which the poet was connected. 
In these lines he waxes satirical over the degeneracy 



of the age. The moral of it all is that the work of 
the Saint is needed to complete tlie Aladdin pala«e 
of oiu- material civilization. Here is a passage con- 
cerning literary taste that — with a suitable .substi- 
tution of names — may be taken to heart in onr 
oym days: 

" Alas ! the river where the millions drink 
Flows from a Helicon of tainted ink : 
Lower and lower the darkening stream descends. 
Till, lost in filth, the sacred fountain ends. 
Who reads Andrea ? here 's a penny tale 
That melts the milkmaid o'er her foaming pail ; 
Who weeps with Luria that can weekly sob 
With all the victims of Sylvanns Cobb ? 
To ' In Memoriam ' why trembling turn 
When fonder pathos flows from Fanny Fern ? 
Why wake the organ wail of Hiawatha 
When piping publishers assume the author ? " 

The degenei-acy of our political life evokes these 
telling couplets : 

" O Land of Lads, and Liberty, and Dollars ! 
O Nation first in schools and last in scholars ! 
Where few are ignorant, yet none excel. 
Whose peasants read, whose statesmen scarcely spell ; 
Of what avail that science lights the way 
When dwindling Senates totter to decay, — 
Like some tall poplar withered at the head, 
Onr middle green, but all the summit dead. 
We do not ask that mind and manners meet — 
Utopian dream — in every Justice seat : 
In troubled times 'tis not to be expected -r 

That Law and Grammar be at once protected : 
We can endure that barristers dispense ' "> 

Tropes, neither rhetoric nor common sense. ., 

While all the rabble bolt the fluent store 
Of broken image, battered metaphor. — 
But, great Diana, when we 're only known. 
In courts where Adams trod and Franklin shone. 
By mute Ambassadors who grandly soom to 
Maim any language save the one they 're bom to ; _ ^ 
When laughing Europe vainly would escape 
Yankee sublime, refulgent in red tape. 
Might not the torch that fired the Ephesian Dome 
Be well employed — a little nearer home ?" 

And Ibsen himself might have signed the following : 

" Enough for us, our earthly errand run. 
To pass an untithed purse from sire to son. 
Too modest to bestow lest men appland, ' ' 

Faith just too feeble to invest with God, 
Just zeal sufficient to shun godless knowledge. 
And just too little to endow a College." 

About three years ago we had occasion to say a 
few appreciative words al)out a slender book of 
" Gedichte " by Mr. George Sylvester Viereck. The 
author, a German- American youth of twentj-, seemed 
to exhibit an unusual degree of talent, both for versi- 
fication and for imaginative effect. Since that time, 
he has been rather conspicuously advertised, and 
his name has come to mean something to our 
English-speaking public. He now reveals himself 
as a bilingual poet by publishing a volimie — 
•' Nineveh, and Other Poems " — which reproduces 
the "Gedichte" in English garb, and supplements 
them bv a number of new pieces. Despite the note 
of sensuality only too apparent in these compositions, 
they are remarkable productions, and we trust that 
their licentiousness illustrates what will prove but a

passing phase of their writer's expression. As it is, 
they suggest such poets an Ernest Dowson and Arthur 
Symons in their most morbid vein, and this is not a 
suggestion to be aimed at by a poet who hopes to be 
taken in a spirit of high seriousness. In the lines 
called " Nineveh " we are given the poet's image of 
the great city of New York. The following stanzas 
end the poem: 

" I, too, the fatal harvest gained 

Of them that sow with seed of fire 
In passion's garden — I have drained 
The goblet of thy sick desire. 

" I from thy love had bitter bliss, 
And ever in my memory stir 
The after-savours of thy kiss — 
The taste of aloes and of myrrh. 

" And yet I love thee, love unblessed 
The poison of thy wanton's art ; 
Though thou be sister to the Pest 
In thy great hands I lay my heart ! 

" And when thy body Titan-strong 
Writhes in its giant couch of sin, 
Yea, though upon the trembling throng 
The very vault of Heaven fall in ; 

" And though the palace of thy feasts 
Sink crumbling in a fiery sea — 
I, like the last of Baal's priests. 
Will share thy doom, O Nineveh." 

We cannot help recalling to what noble purpose 
another youthful poet, some fifty years ago, moral- 
ized upon the burden of his Nineveh, the metropolis 
of our mother-country. Mr. Viereck's garden seems 
thus far to have grown fleurs du mat for the most 
part ; if he were to replant it with roses, or even 
with turnips, he would be well-advised. The inspi- 
ration of Dowson and Oscar Wilde, of Baudelaire 
and Verlaine, is neither vitalizing nor wholesome. 
But there are in Mr. Viereck's pages some indica- 
tions of a nobler mood than derives from the ex- 
ample of such writers as have just been named, and 
he appeals to us far more deeply with his sonnet 
" Friendship " than with all the riotous imagery of 
his *' Ballad of Sin " or the affected satiety of his 
" Sphinx " poems. 

" Lo, in my hour of need I called on thee. 

Asking thy friendship's none too heavy toll ; 
Comrades were we when I was glad and whole. 
And yet thou cam'st not, and at last I see 
Twain are the ways of friendship, and there be 
One that laughs with us o'er the fragrant bowl, 
And one that wanders with the troubled soul 
In the great silence of Gethsemane. 

" I can forgive, and while glad days abound 

Thou shalt be with me ; but when Autumn flings 
The rose-leaf and tlie wine-cup to the ground, 
Then would I call upon the heart that hears 
With intimate love the depth of human things. 
The eye that knows the sanctity of tears." 

Says Mr. William Ellery Leonard at the outset 
of his poems, 

" I would make mention of primeval things." 
An illustration of the fulfilment of this purpose may 
be found in " Mens Immortalis." 



" I am the Lord of Heaven and Hell ; I reign 
King from the blue void to dim gulfs below ; 
My counsellers were gathered long ago 
From conquered hosts of pleasure and of piun. 
And when at sanction of their .suzerain 
They speak the wisdom only they can know. 
My just decrees work thrift or overthrow 
Throughout my old and eminent domain. 

I plant the mountain where I laid the plain. 
Create the seas .md suns of afterglow. 
Call the great thunder and the wild, slant rain. 
And rear me shrines for worship or for show — 
Destroying all, when, for my growth and gain, 
I wish new worlds to rise, new winds to blow." 

The combined intellectuality and austere restraint 
of these lines well exemplify the character of Mr. 
Leonard's "Sonnets and Poems" — some fifty son- 
nets and some score of other pieces. Nature means 
a great deal more to this poet than a mere decorative 
background for human life. She is a solace for 
grief, since 

" When storms are done, 

The wet leaves sparkle on the mountain tree ; 

The gold clouds lie about the setting sun ; 

The blue waves roll their white crests in from sea ; 

The gentle stars mount heaven one by one 

With ancient light, as now they mount to me," 

and she is an unfailing source of strength, for 

•' StiU, 
Tho' we have glossed anew the psalmist's verse. 
Our help shall come from out the ancient hiU, 
And we shall promise largely and fulfil, 
Feeling, as heroes, our unconquered will, 
Part of the epic of the universe I " 

Sometimes the author's joy in nature is touched with 
a note of indignation, as in the lines suggested by a 
rumored sale of the White Mountains to a lumber 
company. 

" We traffic with our birthright : our domain 
Of torrents thundering inland shall be dumb — 
We have sold our cataracts to turn our mills ; 
And having lifted up our eyes in vain. 
Whence our help cometh, but no more may come ; 
Now we would sell the everlasting hills ! " 

These sonnets tempt us to much further quotation. 
Their technique is remarkable for several things, 
for precision and verbal economy, for rhythmical 
balance and sonerous culmination. We cannot alto- 
gether approve of the sort of ruhato trick whereby 
the sestet is frequently shortened by half a line in the 
interests of the octave, but perhaps this is an article 
in the author's creed of revolt against " the marble 
order, the preciser creed " of academic versifiers. 
The poems in other than the sonnet-form include 
some fine specimens of blank verse, among which 
the paraphrases of Heraclitus and Empedocles are 
noteworthy, as are also the lines on " The Cloud," 
dedicated with " reverent love " to the spirit of 
Shelley. 

Mr. Peter McArthur is a thoughtful poet, although 
his inspiration is apt to be a little tame. Occasion- 
ally, as in this sonnet on " Silence," he makes a high 
imaginative flight:

THE DIAL.

•• Beyond the reach of sun or wandering star, 

In that deep cincture of eternal night , 

That shronds and stays this orbid flare of light 
Where many a god hath wheeled bis griding car, 
Silence is brooding, patient and afar. 
Secure and steadfast in his primal right. 
Reconquering slowly, with resistless might. 
Dominions lost in immemorial war. 
The throng^ suns are paling to their doom, 
The constellations waver, and a breath 
Shall blur them all into eternity ; 
Then Ancient Silence in oblivious gloom 

Shall reign — where holds this dream of Time and 
Death 
Like some brief bnbble in a shoreless sea." 

Sometimes the verse is in a lighter vein, illustrated 
by these stanzas '• To the Birds ": 

" How dare you sing such cheerful notes ? 

Yon show a woful lack of Caste ; 
How dare vou poor from happy throats 

Such merry songs with raptured haste. 
While all our poets wail and weep, 
And readers sob themselves to sleep ? 

■■ Tis clear to me. you 've never read 
The turgid tomes that Ibsen writes. 
Nor mourned with Tolstoi virtue dead. 

Nor over Howells pored o' nights : 
For you are glad with all your power ; 
For shame ! Go study Schopenhauer." 

We fear that ilr. McArthur himself has not read 
his Ibsen : if he had, so gpx>tesquely inaccurate a 
phrase as " turgid tomes " could hardly have been 
used as a description of the plays. 

Beginning with a g^roup of classical idyls, and 
ending with a Christmas mystery, Mr John Erskine's 
•* Act«on and Other Poems " offers a series of poet- 
ical exercises, wholly derivative in merit, and of 
slight significance. The stanzas called •' Parting " 
arrest the eye for a moment — they at least express 
a clean-cut thought, and express it prettily. 

■" Not in thine absence, nor when face 
To face, thy love means most to me. 
But in the short-lived parting-space. 
The cadence of felicity. 

■■ So music's meaning first is known. 

Not while the bird sings all day long, 
But when the last faint-falling tone 
Divides the silence from the song." 

Mr. Louis Ledonx informs us that his 

" Song is from a heart 
That tracking orbM Beauty through the world 
With ardor undismayed, self-consecrate 
To follow where the quest may lead, though strange 
And perilous the pathway be, but finds 
Illusive gleams, ineffable desire." 

His book is called " The Soul's Progress, and Other 
Poems." more than half of it being occupied by the 
poem thus named, which is a group of lyrics descrip- 
tive of the journey of the soul " through the realm 
of emotion." These verses, for example, voice the 
mood of " Youth ": 

" I sing the joy of the wind-swept woods. 
The joy of the sunlit sky, 
The joy of the solemn solitudes 

Where the stars bum clear on high ; 



" For life is a joyous song of Love, 
Of Beauty and Delight. 
And human souls in cadence move 
With a hymn of noon and night." 

Mr. Witter Bynner has concocted •• An Ode to 
Harvard " which records the impressions of a 
gTAduaie revisiting his Alma Mater in after years. 
It is a lengthy composition of jocose patter, lacking 
in both dignit}- and restraint. The miscellaneous 
poems which fill the latter (and lesser) half of his 
volume make a somewhat better impression, although 
their artistic quality remains inconsiderable. The 
last poem of aU, " Over the Hills," seems to be the 
best, and we quot« it entire. 

" Over the hills to climb and flee. 

And let no heart be braver ! 
And when they arise like waves of the aek 
O like a bird of the sea to be — 

Over the hills forever I 

" Over the hills to find content. 

To loee the gall and sorrow 
Of letting life and love be spent 
For happiness that came and went, 

Or may not come to-morrow. 

" Over the bills hide half-miknowB 

High haunts of starry cover ; 
O to steal out in the night, alone 
With one close-clasp 'd whose hair is blown — 

And be the perfect lover ! 

** Over the hills at last to know 

The soul of some deep river I — 
And sweet in the fields to rest and grow. 
And swift in the winds to rise and blow — 

Over the hills forever I " 

If the author's habitual flight were as high as this, 
he would be by way of becoming a poet. 

Mr. Edward Gilchrist's ''Tiles from the Porce- 
lain Tower " are the lyrics of a reflective mind, but 
their flow is far from mtisical — a defect due in part 
to the frequent collocation of Ul-matched vocables, 
and in part to the fact that the movement is too much 
clogged with ideas. We select for quotation '"A 
Floral Calendar," having for emblems of the four 
seasons the arbutus, the rose, the cardinal-flower, and 
the goldenrod. This is the first stanza : 

'' Hail and farewell. 
Sweet blossom nurtured in the anow 

That doth compel 
Hiy shape with its star-crystals ere they go ! 

Thou caUest Spring 
Back from the sealM sepulchre of earth. 
Yet diest witnessing her strange new birth 

When the first robins sing 
O'er broken shell. 

Hail, raayflower '. Farewell I " 

The final stanza runs as follows : 

'* Hail and farewell. 
All blessed saints of floral calendar ! 

Now in the cell 
And catacomb of bitter days ye are : 

But pagan frost 
Of persecution shall not long prevail, 
Winter and Death are Knights who hring the Grail 

That we need last and most, — 
Sleep's qnick'ning spell. 

Hail, flowers! Hail and farewell!"

A few translations from the Greek, the Danish, the 
Russian, and the Chinese are appended to Mr. Gil- 
christ's original vei-ses. 

A little gi'oup of volumes from San Francisco, 
containing matter new and old, now claims our 
attention. The smallest of them, but by no means 
the least significant, is " Hathor," the work of Stanly 
Coghill, a young writer who died recently. The 
friend who contributes a prefatory note by way of 
a memorial tells us that the poems are " the over- 
tone of a strangely beautiful soul that was always 
seeking for a half-remembered and perhaps, in this 
world at least, unattainable glory." We quote the 
titular poem. 

" From what far gulf of Time hath she arisen 
To haunt me with her spirit beauty now ? 
How hath she crossed the fathomless abysm, 
The olden glory on her face and brow ? 

*' Does she yet know how once I did adore her 
In that far land where the old river flows ? 
Remembers she how there I knelt before her 
And crowned her witli the lotus and the rose '.' 

" The rose the symbol of her deathless beauty. 
The lotus of her fateful spells tlie sign. 
Of charms that lured ns from the paths of duty, 
Of love that poured forth blood as free as wine ? 

" Remembers she the temple by the river, 
The line of white-robed priests that by her passed, 
The deathless adoiation we did give her, 
The longing looks of love toward her cast ? 

" And sees she one upon the pylon kneeling, 
Watching the white moon sweep across the sky ? 
Heara she the wild and agonized appealing, 
The prayers to look upon her face and die ? 

" Hears she the murmur of the ancient river, 
A-flowing, crooning thro' the Nihis reeds, 
And wonders she if he can yet forgive her 
Who slew his people and his ancient creeds '.' 

" Regrets she e'er the olden love still flies us. 
And new Gods rule us in the old Gods' stead ? 
Hates she the grim Time Spirit who defies us. 
And sweeps away the memory of the dead ? " 

This little book is distinctly worth while. It.s ideas 
are mostly echoes, and it is too much tinged with 
the melancholy in which youth is apt to revel, but 
it has harmony, and flowing rhythm, and something 
of the historical imagination, 

Mr, Louis Alexander Robertson's '■ Through 
Painted Panes, and Other Poems " consists mainly 
of matter reprinted from earlier volumes, the plates 
of which were destroyed in the great fire. But 
the chant royal of the dedicatory " Resurgam " is 
clearly one of the new pieces, and from it we take 
the opening stanza. 

■' The cataclysmal force to which we owe 

Our glorious Gate of Gold, through which the sea 

Rushed in to clasp these shores long, long agt>, 
Came once again to crown our destiny 

With such a grandeur tliat in sequent years 

This period of pain which now appears 

Pregnant with doubt, shall vanish a.s when day 
Drives the foreboding dreams of night away. 

Born of the womb of Woe, where Sorrow sighs, 
Fostered by Faith, undaunted by Dismay, 

Earth's fairest City shall from ashes rise. " 



Dr Edward Robeson Taylor, whose civic honors 
are still fresh in the memory, ha.s put forth a new 
edition of his translation of " Les Troph^as," and a 
new volume of " Selected Poems." It is now ten 
years since his first version of the sonnets of Heredia 
appeared, and by dint of much polishing, the work 
is given, in its present fourth edition, what is likely 
to remain its final shape. Readei-s of poetry have 
much reason to thank Dr. Taylor for the loving 
pains with which he has given them this highly 
acceptable translation of Heredia's finely-chiselled 
poems. Concerning Dr. Taylor's own " Selected 
Poems," which fill a handsome volume of one hun- 
dred and sixty pages, we have to note that most of 
the pieces are reprinted from volumes the plates of 
which were destroyed in the fire. And, as in the 
case of Mr. Robei-tson, we may safely choose a« 
an example of the hitherto unpublished work the 
following sonnet on the diaster which supplied San 
Francisco with a new era from which to reckon her 
chronology: 

'■ Dawn scarce had lit tlie torch of smiling day 

When quaked the earth as witli convulsive fear 
And palsying horror, till, both far and near, 
Death's trurapeta blared where ruin's wreckage lay. 

Then Fire demoniac raged along its way 

On flame-wreathed pinions, hurtling spear on spear 
Of direful doom, while still the strangely drear, 
Calm sun shone on with blood-encrim.soned ray. 

And Devastation through the waste did stride 
With glut so sated, that it truly seemed 
His cup of joy could hold not one drop more. 

But in her fine magnificence of pride 

St, Francis' child blenched not, but greatly dreamed 
Of nobler, grander glories than before."' 

This sonnet is the first of a series of six, all impres- 
sive in imagery and stately in diction. 

William Moeton Payne.

affairs of that society. His presentation of the 
claims of "the religion of humanity," full and satis-

and much more — sympathetic wotk with men and 
for men." Here is morality, it is true, but not suf- 
ficiently tinged with emotion to satisfy every heart. 
The same objection that he urges against pantheism 
as the worship of a vague absti-action, and the same 
reasoning that makes him see poetry but not religion 
in Wordsworth's ''TiDtern Abbey" will operate in 
many minds to discredit " humanity " as an object of 
worship because of its failure to meet the demand 
for a pei-sonal deity. Yet everyone who has thought 
deeply on religion, and its relation to science and to 
practical life, must take delight in the clear thinking 
and the intellectual honesty of one who was early 
" saved from those two intellectual curses of oui- age : 
fii-st, a pedantic specialism which limits students 
to a single group of laws and debilitates the whole 
mind ; secondly, from the presmuptuous foUy of 
attempting to settle ultimate principles by vague 
hypotheses and so-called intuitions, without even an 
elementary conception of true physical law." There 
is cheer in Mr. Harrison's declaration that the world 
is daily growing more and not less religious — not in 
a rapturously ecstatic and foolishly sentimental fash- 
ion, but in a rational, mutually helpful, and soberly 
practical way. 

An interfttina The Parish Clerk is an institution 
in"hf'^"'*' "^ the English Church existing from 
Enrjiifh Chureii. early Saxon times to the present 
though now passing from the stage before the ad- 
vance of improvements wliich the Church has wit- 
nessed during the past fifty years. He gave his 
name to Clerkenwell, a certain locality of London. 
He took a prominent part in the mystery plays of 
his day. His duties and his rights have fi'om time 
to time been defined by law, ecclesiastical and civil. 
He was the choir leader, the representative of the 
people in the responsive services of the Church, 
often the sexton, and quite as frequently the mentor 
of the clerg)-man. He might otherwise be a useful 
member of the community in which he lived in 
the pursuit of some other calling, — as parish-school 
teacher, cobbler, or stone-cutter. Either he was a 
man of little education with a genius for mispro- 
nouncing many of the words of the Church service, 
or else the parish clerks of a better sort have failed 
to leave any impress upon the life and traditions of 
the English communities. He was of such impor- 
tance in London in the thirteenth and subsequent 
centuries that a Parish Clerks' Company was duly 
registered at Guildhall, received subsequently a 
succession of royal charters, and erected a building 
which still exists under the name of the Parish 
Clerks' HaU. Altogether he has deser\'ed much at 
the hands of the historian, and at last he has come 
to his own. The Reverend Peter H. Ditchfield, 
Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and writer of 
many charming books of antiquarian lore, devotes 
a large octavo book to "The Paiish Clerk" (Button), 
illustrating the volume with pictures from many 
sources, chiefly old manuscripts. He relates many 
entertaining stories of the vagaries of the Parish, 



Clerk, but concludes with the suggestion that the 
office be restored to its former functions and that 
the effort be made to obtain more learned and able 
men for the discharge of the duties, and that the 
office be made a sphere of training for those who 
wish to take holv ordei-s. 



,-,.,% . , Professor John C. Van Dyke's new 
and eitjovmeni volume on "Otudies m Pictures 
„f:,,entpiciu,ei. (gcribner) is an attempt to induce 
visitors of picture galleries to adjust tlieu- judgments 
by taking into consideration certain matters likely to 
be ignored. For example, all of the old masterpieces 
now on exhibition in public gfalleries are in a foreign 
environment, uncongenial to their original state with 
respect to lighting, framing, distance, etc. ; most of 
them have been either restored or repainted ; very 
many are wrongly atti-ibuted or copies, sometimes 
forgeries ; their original meaning is frequently quite 
obsolete for the mo<lern mind. All the Madonnas 
and Magdalens and Dianas of the Italian painters, 
all their portraits of lords and ladies, belong to a 
by-gone age ; our sympathy with their subjects can 
go Uttle further than an atlmiration for a ^pe or a 
liking for a sentiment. But though the subjects be 
obsolete, the skill of the artist still lives, the work- 
manship of the pictures is still of vital interest. The 
teaching of the Sistine Ma<lonna, or the story in 
Botticelli's Spring, niay and do slip away ; but the 
figures, the colors, the workmanship endure. To 
study these, to regard art from the artist's point of 
view as something beautiful, decorative, appropriate, 
attractive in itself apart from any meaning symbolic 
or otherwise, — this is what the real study of pictures 
means. To help the reader toward this end. Pro- 
fessor Van Dyke devotes Part I. of his simply-written 
and entertaining book. In Part II. we liave chapters 
on figure-painting, portrait-painting, ffenre painting, 
the animal in art, landscape and marine painting, 
which bring the subject down to modern times and 
living artists. Forty full-page half-tones are well 
chosen to illustrate the text. 



A Irafiedv of 
anti-Sfmititm 



"Why do human beings hurt one 
another so?" is the unanswerable 
question that closes Dr. Max Nordau's 
four-act tragedy, " A Question of Honor," which was 
published in Gei-man nine years ago under the title 
•• Doctor Kohn," and is now translated by Miss Mary 
•J. SafEord and issued to the English-reading public 
by Messrs. John W. Luce & Co. With too little 
action and variety for successful stage production, 
the piece is a moving picture of that form of race- 
hatred known as anti-Semitism. Of Jewish extrac- 
tion himself, the author has wTitten feelingly and 
with first-hand knowledge of that whereof he speaks. 
The plot of the play is briefly this : Dr. Kohn, a Jew, 
— a talented PrivatdocerU (not quite accurately 
translated "'private tutor"), more Gentile than Jew 
in his faith, or want of faith, and in all his habits and 
associations, — falls in love with a girl of ostensibly 
Teutonic parentage, but really half-Jewish herself

through her father, a Hebrew who has renounced 
his race and religion and changed his name. All 
might have gone smoothly, on the surface at least, 
had the lover been willing to embrace Christianity ; 
but he honorably refused to profess a faith that had 
never commended itself to his acceptance, or to dis- 
own a name and an origin that he felt it no shame to 
avow. The heroine remains true to him, even though 
all her relatives except her father turn against her. 
The hero, insulted beyond endurance by her brother, 
demands satisfaction, and falls on the duelling field, 
after firing his pistol into the air. Thoroughly 
German in its details of university life and of social 
and family intercourse, the play is manifestly a hard 
one to turn into idiomatic English that shall not 
violate "local color"; and though the translator has 
done well, in a few places she might have done bet- 
ter. For instance, Frau Moser, surprised by some- 
thing her husband has done, exclaims, "I do not 
recognize you," meaning of course, "that was not 
like you." The play is excellent reading, and offers 
food for thought. 

Stu,He>m ^^- ^^V^ Adams Cram's volume 

eccieaiasttcai " The Gothic Quest " contains a 
areiittecturc. number of lectures and essays that 
have appeared singly in various publications, and 
are here brought together. The essays are not inter- 
related, although the Gothic thread runs through 
them and binds them into a more or less harmonious 
whole. That they are vigorous in expression, and 
not wanting in thoughtfulness and purpose, is what 
those who know him expect in the essays of Mr. 
Cram. Those in the present collection are mainly 
a discussion of ecclesiastical architecture from the 
Gothic standpoint, or, rather, from the standpoint of 
the English High Church. Formalism and ritual- 
ism seem to hold as high a place in Christian art, to 
Mr. Cram's mind, as do form and abstract beauty in 
art generally. The purpose is so evident in these 
chapters, and the literary expression is so lost in 
emphasizing the point, that the charm of certain 
other of Mr. Cram's writings is missing here. There 
is meat in the essays, and good reading for the 
non "Beaux " artists, as well as what might be whole- 
some reading for them. In Mr. Crani's architectiu-al 
work, as in his literature, there is an avowed leaning 
to the English ; but his power of selection is finer in 
his architectm-e, — at least it seems to us, who admire 
and sympathize with his work, — than in his literary 
form. It is hard to account for the frequent occur- 
ence of the phrase " different to " in the writing of 
a born. New Englander ; there are sweeter draughts 
to be drawn at the font of " English pm-e and unde- 
liled." But, after all criticism of form and matter, 
one must feel that what underlies the volume should 
be known and appreciated by every individual or 
committee or congregation interested in the building 
of a Christian shrine, or house of worship, or temple. 
A chapter on Architectural Education is good read- 
ing for architect or layman. The Baker & Taylor Co. 
have published the volume in attractive form. 



A final edition ^he third and concluding volume 
«/ America's of "The Poems of Philip Freneau, 
earliest poet. p^gj „f jjjg American Revolution" 
(The University Library, Princeton, N. J.), of which 
Volume I. was reviewed in The Dial of June 16, 
1903, has now appeared. It contains the poems 
written between 1790 and 1815, a quarter-century 
in which many things happened. Freneau was a 
keen though by no means impartial observer of 
European as well as of American affairs, and re- 
corded his thoughts in verse so freely that this vol- 
ume may be said to form a running commentary on 
the entire period. There are several spirited jwems 
on the French Revolution ; and in his remarks on 
the War of 1812, Freneau still wields the same 
biting weapon with which he had scourged the 
Tories of an earlier day. The volume concludes 
with a list of poems (119 titles) which, for various 
reasons (in only one instance for coarseness alone), 
it has seemed wise not to reprint ; a bibliography of 
Freneau's poetry, based on Mr. Paltsits's more elab- 
orate volume of 1903, which it corrects in some 
details and sujjplements ; and a good index to the 
whole work. The editor. Professor Pattee, is to be 
congratulated upon the very satisfactory appearance 
of this definitive edition of America's first poet. 
" Hezekiah Salem" (as Freneau, a born fighter, 
frequently signed himself in 1809) deserves to be 
something more than a mere name in histories of 
our literature, and will now become better known. 
He was far from gi'eat ; but it is something to have 
portrayed so faithfully and so fully that spirit which 
defied King George, and which laid the foundations 
of the Republic , — and who shall say how much his 
stirring verse helped to do these things ?

Times" (Putnam), nor is the exact cause of her 
quarrel with the peppery little poet determined ; but 
the book is the first, as it may well enough suffice 
for the last, detailed and painstaking recital of all 
that diligent research can find to say about this 
remarkable woman. Other lives of her we have in 
some abundance, but they are mostly in the form of 
prefatory memoirs prefixed to her works, and do not 
compare in fulness with Mr. Paston's 559-page 
octavo. He has had access to " four or five hun- 
dred unpublished letters" to and from the Wortley 
Montagus, and has also drawn upon Lady Mary's 
unpublished fragment of an autobiography. Numer- 
ous portraits are of course pi'ovided ; there was no 
lack of these to choose from. The appended list of

Socialism" (Crowell), presents a critical study of 
the socialistic theory in its most rigid form. The 
doctrines of the English Classical School — the

will be an -'era of perfect peace." Furthermore, 
he sees slight gi-ound for predicting that this social- 
istic era — economically disastrous, as he believes —

his points skilfully, but one must bear in mind that 
in his small volume he in no way attempts to con-

equally as fascinating as his former successes, if not

THIS MONTH'S 
MAGAZINES 

A Word to Librarians: 

Every librarian is constantly 
being asked questions like 
this about current periodicals: 
"What new magazine is that 
article about in ?" 

The only index that supplies this 
kind of information is WHAT'S 
IN THE MAGAZINES. 

Your regular periodical index, un- 
equalled as it is for general refer- 
ence, is necessarily three or four 
weeks behind time. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

for October (for instance) comes 
out when the October magazines 
are being published. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

gives a classified index of the con- 
tents of one hundred leading peri- 
odicals, grouped according to sub- 
ject and general character, and 
arranged alphabetically. 

Although complete and accurate, it 
is so simple in arrangement that 
the library patrons can use it as 
easily as the librarian. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

is very inexpensive — fifty cents a 
year — and every library should be 
a subscriber. If you are the li- 
brarian of a library with many 
magazine readers, you can readily 
see what an aid it will be to you. 

We should be glad to receive 
your subscription, or to send you 
a free sample copy upon request.

A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF 
SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS. 



What joy to write of Shakespeare ! To deal 
with him is like clipping into the Fountain of 
Youth and rising renewed and resplendent. It 
is said of Rossetti that he never tired of anyone 
who could talk to him of Keats. No reiteration 
of critical comment can weary the Shakespeare- 
lover. He can read the driest gossip that has 
to do with his god, he can sit out the fiftieth 
hearing of one of the plays. Merely to recite 
to himself the names of the plays, to call the roll 
of his favorite characters, to let the music and 
picture of the verse steal over his mind, is like 
holding up to his eye jewel after jewel from an 
Orient casket — ruby, diamond, emerald, and 
pearl — and watching the flash and sparkle and 
play of color ; it is like walking in the garden 
of Alcinous, where apple succeeded apple and 
pear succeeded pear, and blossom and fruit were 
on the branch at once. 

For Shakespeare is not only himself alone. 
The intellect of the world has been squandered 
upon him for centuries. He has, as it were, 
robbed generation after generation to add t» his 
own store. Think of the critics who have come 
from all four quarters of the globe, bearing their 
gifts of honey or spices to lay at his feet I Think 
of the artists and illustrators whose embodi- 
ments, whether successful or not, are r^ged tier 
beyond tier in our minds ! Think of the players, 
at once the best critics and best illustrators of 
Shakespeare, whose melody of voice, whose state- 
liness or beauty or charm of person, are inex- 
tricably blent in our memories with the poetry 
itself I Our thought of Shakespeare is truly a 
complex of association. 

It is more for mere delight in dealing with 
the subject, than with any hope of unearthing 
a critical treasure-trove, that some suggestions 
are ventured as to the classification of the plays. 
A chronological arrangement, if it could be got 
at, would be the ideal one, as showing the devel- 
opment of Shakespeare "s mind and art. But that 
is not to be hoped for. The ordinary division, 
into comedies, histories, and tragedies, is crude 
enough. Some of the plaj's classed as comedies 
are thoroughly tragic ; and there are many of 
mixed species. Why not let them pair and group 



108 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



into families, according to their inward charac- 
teristics ? Mates and natural companions would 
suit and set each other off better than if sep- 
arated by intruding and discordant pieces. 

There are, first, the two farces, " The Comedy 
of Errors " and " The Taming of the Shi-ew." 
Barring the Christopher Sly framework of the 
latter piece, which is in his richest natural vein, 
these plays are like nothing else of Shakespeare's. 
He was trying his hand at the Latin or Italian 
type of comedy ; and while they are mechanical 
to a degree compared with his other work, they 
have immense skill and vivacity and theatrical 
life. 

Then there are the two comedies of fancy, 
" The Two Gentlemen of Verona " and " Love's 
Labour's Lost," — the first, boyish, gentle, tame, 
but with gleams of the truest humor and with 
the unfolded buds of half of Shakespeare's gar- 
den of comedy in it ; the second, the vei-y riot 
of youthful wit and imagination and feeling. 
Tennyson's " Princess " is the modern analogue 
of " Love's Labour's Lost," and, though rich and 
elaborate, has little of the vividness and reality 
and headlong high spirits of the older work. 

Next come Shakespeare's great plays of pure 
humor and wit. There is the dazzling " Much 
Ado about Nothing," which, though with a 
sheen of poetry over it, and even a sudden open- 
ing abyss of passion, is yet predominantly humor- 
ous. Then there ai-e the two parts of " Henry 
IV.," with their scenes of heroism and war and 
statecraft serving as a mere foil to the more 
important adventures of Falstaff. And there 
is the " Merry Wives of Windsor," where that 
incarnation of Original Evil, that projection of 
the irresponsible part of humanity, wallows 
about like Behemoth in a sea too small for him. 
Cleon, Miles Gloriosus, Trimalchio, Panurge, 
Sancho Panza, and their later descendants Dick 
Swiveller and Micawber, all creep ^long in 
fiction imder the shadow of the mighty bidk of 
Falstaff. 

" Twelfth Night " and " As You Like It " 
form a separate species of Shakespeare's work 
— the species of poetic hmnor ; and they are 
alone in their kind in literature. Aristophanes 
beats Shakespeare in airy inventiveness, as in 
"The Birds" and "The Clouds." Rabelais 
rivals him in the comedy of wisdom — the sage's 
look behind the grotesque mask. Cervantes and 
St«rne equal him in the humor of contrasts ; 
Moliere surpasses him in cool social satire. But 
for poetry, romance, passion, tenderness, wit, 
humor, fun, all blended together into an intoxi- 
cating draught of happiness, there is nothing 



like these two plays. They are the top and 
crown of the whole world's work in comedy. 
And, as being unique, we could almost have 
the heart to declare them Shakespeare's master- 
pieces. For in tragedy the world may produce 
sometliing to equal his best, as indeed it has 
done in the past ; but it is improbable that any- 
one will ever again recover the Golden Age as 
it is embodied in these two plays. 

In the two comedies of the imagmation, 
" The Tempest " and " A Midsummer Night's 
Dream," we are on the turn of the tide which 
is to sweep us toward great and serious poetry. 
Comedy abounds in both ; but the latter piece 
is an ironic, not a real, ^presentation of life, and 
in " The Tempest " the deep gi-ave notes of 
poetry boom like surf on a sunny day, advertis- 
ing one of shipwreck and death. As anyone 
who has seen Miss Russell's recent production 
of " A Midsummer Night's Dream " can realize, 
that piece is a view of human life seen from 
Fairyland. The fairies ai'e the sane and rea- 
sonable personages, the men and women the 
incongTuous and absurd ones. 

" Cymbeline " and " The Winter's Tale " 
have always been called romances, and there is 
no better name for them ; only I woidd add 
" The Merchant of Venice " and " Romeo and 
Jidiet " to the gi-ouj}. In aU, the serious, if 
not tragic, interest prevails, and in all there is 
a rich vividness in the outward setting and a 
tumultuous passion in the life portrayed, which 
is different from anything in the comedies. The 
sunlight is stronger and the shadows are deeper. 
" The Merchant of Venice " is the more multi- 
form and many-colored. It is like a bed of 
tiger-lilies , which in the end blanch out into 
pure white. " Romeo and Juliet " is the most 
intense in feeling and most single in action of 
all Shakespeare's plays. It leaps on like flash 
after flash of lightning, almost intolerably 
dazzling and splendid. "The Winter's Tale," 
handicapped by a bad story in the beginning, 
and divided into two parts, only recovers itself 
as a poem in the second half, where the pastoral 
scenes and pomp of festival and Perdita s charm 
lift it to a high level. Yet the earlier action is 
more theatrically effective. In reading the 
play, one almost pities Shakespeare for such an 
obvious " god from the machine " device as the 
oracle. But the thing is triumphantly powerfid 
on the stage. We are all agreed about the 
central character and central scenes of " Cym- 
beline." Nothing in Shakespeare touches the 
imagination and the heart more deeply than 
Imogen's adventurous flight and seeming death ^ 



1907.] 



THE DIAJ^ 



109 



There is a group of four pieces which might 
be named the satire plays. It consists of *' All 's 
Well that Ends Well," " Measure for Meas- 
ure," " Troilus and Cressida," and " Timon of 
Athens." No other play is so hard to place in 
this arranjrement as the first of these. It is 
highly romantic in the figure of the heroine, 
but Bertram and Parolles are dealt with in the 
spirit of unsparing satire. " Measure for 
Measure " is Shakespeare's grimmest work. 
Earth's blackness and earth's decay pervade it, 
with one figure of the purest light moving 
about amid its bagnios and prisons and charnel- 
houses. *' Troilus and Cressida " is Shake- 
speare's one great parody. After spending his 
life in celebrating gi-eatness and beauty and 
truth and honor, he turned in inexplicable dis- 
gust to strike at everything he believetl in. In 
" Timon of Athens " he followetl the Lucianic 
work so closely that the play has less originality 
than anything he did. He added a scenic 
splendor and fuhiess to the bare Greek dialogue, 
and to the later speeches of the great misan- 
thrope gave a power and majesty of scorn which 
makes all other satire seem tame and hollow. 

The foiu" great tragedies of power and pas- 
sion, '-Lear,' "Hamlet," "Macbeth," and 
" OtheUo," have always been recognized as iso- 
lated in Shakespeare's work, the equal and domi- 
nating peaks of his moimtain range. " OtheUo " 
seems decidedly inferior to the other three in 
power and interest. Yet its theme — the con- 
test of Good and Evil, which is the central 
idea of most religions — has probably never 
been so clearly and strongly embodied. In 
" Faust " there is really no struggle of oppo- 
nents, for the German Doctor is at heart as bad 
as his familiar, and Marguerite is weak. In 
Milton, the moi-al principle has somehow got 
twisted, and we sympathize with the brave and 
noble Devil. In the Hindoo Ramayana, with 
its contest between Kama and Ravana over the 
pure and beautiful Sita, the theme is set forth 
powerfully, though with less concentration than 
in " OtheUo.'" Perhaps the reason for the slight 
coldness I feel towards " OtheUo " — I know 
not if anyone else shares it — is that the piece 
is too painful, too pathetic. The misfortunes of 
the gootl characters are undeserved, are brought 
about by their frankness, trustfulness, and 
nobiUty. Lear's fate is largely due to his own 
temper, and his ruin is demanded for the exhi- 
bition of the utmost grandeur of human char- 
acter. Macbeth and his wife only get their 
come-uppanee. And I defy anyone to pity 
Hamlet of the kingly mien and mind. But we 



must say " Poor OtheUo ! " " Poor Desdemona ! " 
" The pity of it " is predominant in our minds. 
The three Roman plays we shoidd denomi- 
nate scenical tragedies. Shakespeare's mind 
does not seem thoroughly at home in the Roman 
world of law and form. He was, indeed, Uke 
a mountain, which has one side facing the 
north, lit by gray skies or the mystic glamor of 
the moon, with prodigious precipices, with 
glaciers, with impenetrable forests ; but whose 
other side slopes gently to the south and to the 
sun, and shows fields and vineyards and tem- 
ples and peopled towns. But it was the Greek 
or later Italian life of the South with which he 
was in sympathy, — a life whose ideals were 
Uberty and leisui-e, art and love. Roughly 
speaking, it may be said that nobody works in 
Shakespeare's plays. Warriors and statesmen, 
of course, there are; but most of his characters are 
technically ladies and gentlemen. If tradesmen 
or handicraftsmen are introduced, they are 
treated with a good deal of contempt. The 
i harsh Roman world of duty and discipline did 
I not much inspire him. It did not inspire the 
I Roman poets. So it foUows that, good as " Cori- 
! olanus " and " JuUus Caesar "' are, Shakespeare's 
one triumphant achievement in this field is in 
" Antony and Cleopatra." The Greek queen 

— that colossal coiui«san who took in empires 
for a night's caress — is studied with loving 
care and portrayetl with supreme success. 

The inferiority of historic to legendary or 
freely invented material for literary creation is 
iUustrated in the chronicle plays which remain 
to be noted. With the exception of two or three 
of the comedies, they are the least valuable of 
Shakespeare's works. Only two of them, indeed, 
— and those the two in which legend has the most 
part, " Richard III." and " Henry V." — possess 
at aU the fused and flaming character of works 
of art. The rest are things of shreds and patches 

— splendid shreds and patches indeed, as in the 
passion of Constance, the pathos of Arthur, the 
superb truculence and truth of Falconbridge in 
" King John," the character of Catherine in 
"Henry VIII.," and passage upon passage in the 
three parts of " Henry VI." In " Riclmrd II." 
Shakespeare is beating up against the wind of 
an unpromising subject — tacking and veering 
with great skiU and persistence, but not reaUy 
arriving anywhere. 

Of the two doubtf id plays, " Pericles " is not 
doubtfid at aU. It is authentic Shakespeare in 
great part, though doubtless patched up with 
older work. The wanderings of the Prince of 
Tyre and the sufferings of his daughter are most

affecting, and there is little to wonder at in the 
popularity of the piece which moved Ben Jonson 
to wrath. " Titus Andronicus " is about as bad 
a play as was ever written, but that is no reason 
why it should not have been the work of the 
youthful Shakespeare. That such a mind as his 
shoidd have come to years of majority without 
doing anything in verse, is incredible. Crude 
and horrible as the piece is, it has power. The 
young poet who begins with power may go far ; 
the one who begins with good taste has ah-eady 
reached the length of his tether. 

It is hardly necessary to say that the order 
in which the plays are printed does not seem of 
any particular importance. But it is interest- 
ing to note the resemblances and relationships 
among them, and to observe the considerable 
number of groups into which they break up. 
For Shakespeare's title to the throne of univer- 
sal literature rests on his variety. He is lord 
of more domains than any other poet. Homer 
has no humor, no mystery, no romantic idealism. 
-liEschylus is altogether outside of hmnor, almost 
outside of humanity. Dante has a grim wit, but 
the lighter and kindlier traits of man are hid- 
den from him ; he is intolerant of two-thirds 
of human nature. And if we turn to the come- 
dians, they fail in seriousness, in splendor, in 
beauty. But Shakespeare's hand is on all the 
sceptres of aU the rulers of literature. Supreme 
religious ecstasy is the only region where his 
dominion is not a.ssured ; and he wanders around 
its borders in constant metaphysical debate and 
wonder. Charles Leonard Moore. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The prosperity op the writers of the "best 
SELLERS OP THE SEASON " has moved Mr. H. G. 
Wells to epigram. He says that in old days the 
authors died and the books lived ; whUe now the 
books die and the authors live. Mr. Wells himself 
is so good a writer that his chance of breaking into 
what he calls the motor-car class in literatui-e must 
be remote. For so delightful a humorist, he is 
singularly serious. He takes the fate of mankind 
and the follies of society hard. The world is too 
much with him ; like Atlas, he has it always on his 
shoulders. He has reformed the world, or prophe- 
sied its dire and hopeless future, in a half-dozen 
books. Fascinating and remarkable as these are, 
they are so redolent of chemicals, so resonant with 
the buzzing of machinery, that they repel the or- 
dinary literary instinct. It is Poe without his 
profundity, Jules Verne without his cheerfulness. 
The tragedy in them is not the tragedy of individ- 



uals, which the masses always thrill to, — it is the 
tragedy of the masses, which only a few individuals 
can recognize. Fortunately for Mr. Wells's fame, 
a number of his books are written in a diflPerent 
mood, under another inspiration. There is " The 
Wheels of Chance," for example. One associates 
this story with Mr. Aldrich's " Queen of Sheba," 
Mr. HoweUs's " Lady of the Aroostook," and Mr. 
Viele's " Inn of the Silver Moon." It is more real 
than any of these, and not less romantic. How, in 
a mere handsbreadth, as it were, of apparently 
unstudied prose, there can be crowded so much 
humor, so many clear and glowing vignettes of 
English scenery, and such a collection of eccentric 
yet unforced characters is a wonder and a study. 
Mr. Wells's longest novel, " Kipps," is a re-handling 
of the same theme. It wants the freshness of the 
earlier story, but is even more masterly, and has 
one character at least which is in the ranks of first- 
class comedy creations. But even in this book Mr. 
WeUs's social worries rather embarass his art. He 
seems to have an ever-lingering doubt whether in 
this sorry world he has the right to take joy in his 
own creative gifts. ... 

The GENTLE ART OP EXTRA-ILLUSTEATING, in 

these days of cheap and numerous process prints, is 
within the reach of nearly everyone who has taste 
and time for it. A pile of discarded magazines or 
a dollar's worth of " Perry Pictures," with scissors 
and paste, will furnish means for increasing the 
value and interest of a shelf-ful of old books — not 
new ones, whose immaculate pages and stiff bind- 
ings deprecate the extra-Ulustrator's attentions. A 
well-read and preferably somewhat loose-jointed 
copy of Hawthorne's " House of Sev^n Gables," for 
example, can be turned into a lavishly-illustrated 
volume by inserting appropriate plates from a ten- 
cent album of old Salem's historic scenes. Long- 
fellow's poems, too, offer material for the exercise 
of literary-artistic taste and skill. An easily obtain- 
able view of the fine old tree-shaded mansion on 
East Street in Pittsfield where stood the ancient 
time-piece that ticked out its endless refrain of 
" forever — never ! never — forever ! " gives fresh 
meaning to "The Old Clock on the Stairs," and a 
penny picture of the Reef of Norman's Woe appro- 
priately illustrates " The Wreck of the Hesperus." 
This is good work for invalids and convalescents ; 
it helps to hang about the walls of the mind a tap- 
estry of literary and historic associations, and, inci- 
dentally, it sometimes proves to be a pecuniarily 
profitable use of one's time — as when some rich 
collector takes a fancy to some product of the extra- 
illustrator's art and pays him a fancy price for it.

of college stadents. " Nowhere in the world," said 
Ambassador Bryce in his late address at Chicago 
University, •' does there seem to be so large a part 
of the people that receive a university education as 
here in America. The effects of this will no doubt 
be felt in the coming generation. Let us hope they 
will be felt not only in the complete equipment of 
your citizens for public life and their warmer zeal 
for civic progress, but also in a true perception of 
the essentild elements of happiness, a larger capacity 
for enjoying those simple pleasures which the culti- 
vation of taste and imagination opens to us all." 
Earlier in the same address, which was entitled, 
•• What University Instruction May do to Provide 
Intellectual Pleasures for Later Life," Mr. Bryce 
took occasion to emphasize the need that we increas- 
ingly feel as we grow older " to have all the help 
and inspiration for our own lives that poetry can 
give. Much of everyone's work is dull and depress- 
ing, and that escape from dulness which the strain 
of fierce competition or bold speculation gives is a 
dangerous resource. It is better to feed what I have 
called the inner life. Not all can succeed in life ; 
none can escape its sorrows. He who under disap- 
pointments or sorrows has no resources within his 
own command beyond his business life, nothing to 
which he can turn to cheer or refresh his mind, 
wants a precious spring of strength and consolation." 
Let us hope, then, that out of the multitudes enter- 
ing college this fall some considerable number will 
enter for the purpose of feeding the inner life 
rather than the foot-ball eleven, the boat crew, or 
the base-ball nine. ... 

Who are "fobeigx authobs"? is a question 
forcibly presented by Miss L. H. .Soutar, a Scotch- 
woman, in a recent number of " The Author " of 
London. In the articles of association of the Society 
of Authors, the phrase " English and foreigfn 
authors " occurs : and Miss .Soutar objects, as do 
many of her race, to this comprehensive use of the 
proper adjective. " Like the majority of Scotch 
and Irish people," she writes, '•! feel resentful 
when our countries and peoples are grouped under 
the titles of England and English. If the Incor- 
porated Society of Authors is a national institution 
and instituted to assist British authors, then I con- 
sider there is a lack of correctness in substituting 
the word English for British." Reference b then 
made to some of .Scotland's famous writers, who 
could not properly be included in a list of English 
authors, but would surely take a high place in a 
catalogue of British poets and novelists. But what 
are we to do with Irish writers, with Charles Lever 
and Thomas Moore and Clarence Siangan? The 
people of the Emerald Isle would surely never con- 
sent to be called British, and still less would they 
care to have all authors of the L'nited Kingdom 
grouped together under the designation Irish. There 
is Mr. Hall Caine, too, a Manxman, not to mention 
the Welsh writers ; what are we to do with them ? 
The ilanchester " Guardian " humorously suggests 



the mouth-filling compound •' Anglirwelscotmanx ' 
for the literature of the British islands. But the 
term ''English" will not be driven out; as well 
might one object to the use of "* Roman " as applied 
to the ancient empire of that name, or to " Yankee " 
as designating a citizen of the United States, The 
most important or best-known part usurps the pre- 
rogatives of the whole. A curious reverse usage, 
however, is found in the adjective " American," 
which is commonly understood as referring to this 
country. ... 

The self-conscioushess ok modeku liteka- 
TtJKE, its sophisticated, scientific, positive tone, and 
its individualism, which makes each writer a canon 
and measure to himself, are somewhat depressingly 
insisted upon by Mr. R. A. Scott-James in an En- 
glish journal. He declares at the outset that good 
criticism, which Matthew Arnold defined as "'a 
disinterested endeavour to learn and propagate the 
best that is known and thought in the world," can- 
not now be confined to the limits thus fixed. " For 
surely," he explains, '' you cannot possibly know 
the best until you know something of the worst." 
But is that true? One might quote here, without 
too great irrelevancy, the definition of a good and 
wise judge in Plato's " Republic," and the philoso- 
pher's conclusion that •' vice cannot know virtue, bat 
a virtuous nature, educated by time, will acquire 
knowledge both of virtue and vice." And this 
sentiment, as is well enough known, our New En- 
gland Plato has repeated. 3Ir. ScottnJames main- 
tains, further, that science has killed superstition, 
reason strangled fancy, and modern psychology 
made us introspective and unspontaneous. This is 
true in part but not in so full a sense as to leave us 
with the barren prospect contemplated by the 
essayist. We are conquering new kingdoms, invad- 
ing and taking possession of new realms ; yet this 
extension of our frontiers does not mean that there 
is to be no terra incognita beyond. We still march 
with it, the only difference being that our boundaries 
are immensely enlarged. The literary outlook was 
never so richly promising as now. From the chaos 
of contemporary publications, those fit to survive 
will in time be recognized by that " high serious- 
ness " which Mr. ScottJ^ames admires in Matthew 
Arnold, but thinks to be no longer possible in 
literary criticism. ... 

The populab dema:xt> for poetry is admit- 
tedly small ; hence the satisfaction we take in noting 
one poet — not a great poet, perhaps rather a mem- 
ber of the numerous company of minor poets — 
whose works have been in such demand as to neces- 
sitate their reprinting nearly every year since their 
collective issue eleven years ago. The following 
letter from Mr. Alfred Nutt to the London "Press" 
is worth reprinting for the encouragement it affords 
to those that have the cause of poetry at heart 
'' WiU you allow Henley's publisher," writes Mr. 
Nutt " to state his opinion that public appreciation 
of his work is far more widespread and deep-seated

than the writer of the admirahle leader in your 
issue of the 1 1th inst. is disposed to admit. For a 
certain kind of popularity Henley would have had 
nothing but loathing, equal loathing for the tricks 
and artifices by which certain popular writers allow 
themselves to be boomed into public favor. Even 
if such artifices were not equally repugnant to 
myself, I should have felt precluded from using 
them on Henley's behalf. It is therefore significant 
that the sale of his best work maintains itself at a 
high level, it having been found necessary to reprint 
the ' Poems ' almost every year since the collected 
edition of 1896 ; that there is a steadily increasing 
demand from compilers of anthologies for permission 
to include specimens of his work ; and that com- 
posers also show an increasing appreciation of the 
essential singing qualities of his lyrics which kins 
him closer to Heine than any other English poet of 
the nineteenth century. The public is really not so 
fickle or so unintelligent as is sometimes feared. 
Good work finds its level, and the lovers of the 
best literature are not so few as is imagined." This 
letter is a credit to the publisher who writes it, as 
well as to the poet whose name it exalts.

The prevalence of transmitted stupiditt 
is more noticeable than that of inherited genius. 
Great men's sons are conceded to bear little resem- 
blance to their fathers, as a rule. It takes several 
generations for nature to recover from the exhaus- 
tion consequent on the endowment of a genius. 
Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon, Shakespeare, 
Scott, and Dickens, left no sons that could wield their 
sceptres. And yet Dickens did have one son, his 
youngest, the late Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, 
who could on occasion show a spark of his illustrious 
father's wit. Emigrating (not under compulsion) 
to Australia, he represented for six years a con- 
stituency in the parliament of New South Wales — 
although his legislative experience appears to have 
been unhappy, since he was heard to say, after being 
defeated by a labor candidate, that he was " out of 
health, out of temper, and out of pocket," because 
of having accepted an election to parliament. Once 
— and this vras when he displayed a gleam of his 
father's brightness — he was addressing the House, 
when an opposing member, Willis by name, annoyed 
him repeatedly with snappish interruptions. Finally 
endurance could no further go, and Mr. Dickens 
turned to the chair and said : " Mr. Speaker, my 
father coined a famous phrase — ' Barkis is willing.' 
Under present circumstances I am strongly tempted 
to reverse it and say, ' Willis is barking.' " Laughter 
from the House and quiet from Willis then ensued.

A kevivad of Greek tragedy in France is 
reported, and it appears to enjoy a popular success 
that is both astonishing and gratifying. Houses are 
filled, and the people give unmistakable evidence of 
a capacity to appreciate something higher than 
continuous vaudeville. The movement began about 
twelve years ago, when the little city of Orange, in 



the Midi, recollected that it had the remains of a 
Roman amphitheatre, built in the days when Gaul 
was in that tripartite condition of which every 
schoolboy has learned with tears and groans. With 
the aid of M. Mounet-Sully and support from the 
Theatre Fran^ais, Sophocles's " Qidipus the King " 
was impressively rendered, in free translation. 
Other towns with ruins of Roman theatres, and even 
towns without them, took the hint, and out-of-door 
performances of Greek tragedy attained a certain 
vogue ; eminent composers furnished the necessary 
choral music, and the best orchestras of France 
conti'ibuted of their skill as executants. The new 
fashion spread northward from rural southern 
France until the very suburbs of Paris caught the 
fever, and now it is reported that in the heart of 
the city itself, on the stages of the Com^die Franjaise 
and the Theatre Frangais, ^-Eschylus, Sophocles, and 
Euripides are played to appreciative audiences. In 
the spring and summer of this year " Electra " has 
had thirty performances — not a bad run for a 
Sophoclean play in the twentieth century. Note- 
worthy, too, is the popular refusal to be satisfied 
with any modern imitations of Greek tragedy: the 
real thing is demanded, and tliat with an urgency 
that makes it pay to give it. It looks as if it were 
turning out, after all, to be impossible to fool all the 

people all the time with inferior drama. 
• • • 
The decline of the poetic dr.ima in En- 
gland receives a new explanation, and to our mind 
not a very convincing one, from Mr. Walter Raleigh, 
who in his recent life of Shakespeare cuts off the 
heads of a good many flourishing weeds of criticism, 
while planting not a few new ones himself. " With 
the disappearance of the boy-players," says Mr. 
Raleigh, " the poetic drama died in England ; and 
it has had no second life." Mr. Raleigh's " most 
exquisite reason " for this amazing theory is that 
" Poetry, like religion, is outraged when it is made 
a platform for the exhibition of their own talent or 
passion by those who are its ministers." In other 
words, the better a piece of literature is interpreted 
the worse it is, and the nearer to its death. We do 
not believe that the advent of women players had 
anything to do with the fall of the poetic drama. 
The elaboration of scenery may be partly to blame. 
But the simplest explanations are the lack of poetic 
genius in the dramatists, and a gradual coarsening 
of taste in the public. Even yet, audiences are re- 
sponsive to what they think is poetry or fine vrriting. 
Claude Melnotte's picture of his imaginary palace can 
always be relied upon for a round of applause. And 
as a rule, Shakespeare's set speeches are listened to 
with pleased attention. If actresses killed the poetic 
drama in England, why did they not prevent its rise 
in France and Germany ? One does not place the 
drama of Corneille and Racine, or that of Hugo and 
Musset, or thatof Goethe and Schiller, on an equality 
with the Elizabethan theatre, but they are each and 
all of them great enough, and poetic enough, to make 
Mr. Raleigh's theory untenable.

Puritans. Why, then, did he make the historical 
part of his speech fairly bristle with the words 
Puritan and Puritanism, and never onc« name the 



' Pilgrims ? The founders of Plymouth had naught 
of the Puritan's reli^ous bigotry and fanaticism, 
and Mayflower descendants are quick to resent any 
such imputation. The compact drawn up in Pro- 
vincetown harbor, in the cabin of the little vessel 
that had survived the bufferings of the stormy 
Atlantic, was conceived in no spirit of Puritanical 
strictness : it has been commended for its liberalism. 
It is significant that the speakers who followed the 
chief orator were scrupulously correct in avoiding 
the word Puritan and in paying due tribute to the 
virtues of the Pilgrim fathers and mothers, many 
I of whose descendants were in the audience. Senator

BtJBTON THE Unappreciated.* 

The " real " Washington or Cromwell or 
Franklin which it has become the literary 
fashion to offer with so solemn an air of at last 
serving up the genuine man as he walked and 
talked, and as his contemporaries saw him, is 
of course nothing but the writer's conception or 
ideal of the character he has chosen to paint, 
labelling his picture " The Real Agamemnon," 
much as the schoolboy writes under the rude 
drawing on his slate, " This is a horse." Mr. 
Walter Phelps Dodge's "Real Sir Richard 
Burton " is actually a panegyric rather than a 
biography, and appears to owe its origin to 
the writer's dissatisfaction with Mr. Thomas 
Wright's much more detailed and more " real " 
presentation of the same interesting man. But 
the later and smaller work will serve its uses as 
a handy epitome of the chief events in Burton's 
life, and as a glowing tribute will help to keep 
fresh the laurels on the dead hero's brow. To 
original research or critical acumen it can make 
little claim, nor does the author appear to have 
had any personal acquaintance with the subject 
of his sketch. 

As Mr. Dodge chooses to dwell so insistently 
on the injuries his hero has received from the 
world in general and from Mr. Wright in par- 
ticular, it may be worth while to examine a few 
of these charges of crying injustice. He says 
of the offending biogi-aphy that it "is more of a 
Criticism than a Biography, and is a note book, 
practically devoted to a discursive and abortive 
effort to prove that Burton did not rank as a 
translator with John Payne. Wright also ab- 
surdly states that Burton borrowed much of the 
material in his ' Arabian Nights ' from Payne." 
And further : " The charge made by Wright 
in his so-called Life of Burton, that the Haji 
plagiarised from Payne ... is ridiculous." 
Why all this heat? The glory of the home- 
keeping, dictionary-thmnbing translator is one, 
and the glory of the restlessly wandering student 
of men and manners, and the marvellously 
versatile speaker of many tongues, is another. 
Not even Mr. Dodge would like to think of the 
Chevalier Burton as biting his nails to the quick 
in a futile endeavor to hit on the exact English 
equivalent of an Arabic term, nor should he 
begrudge the scholarly Payne his weU-eamed 
distinction as a skilful interpreter of alien lan-

guages. To make light of Mr. Wright's " deadly 
parallels," whereby the later translators ap- 
propriations from his predecessor's version are 
made glaringly apparent, is no satisfactory 
explanation of these curious instances of verbal 
identity — an identity that must be regarded 
as something more than " a necessary resem- 
blance in Englishing the text." Phrases and 
sentences alike in both versions occur too often 
to be ascribed to chance ; and identical passages 
of considerable length are not wanting, one of 
them reaching to the length of forty-four words. 
The assertion, too, that Burton's translation has 
" replaced aU other versions of the ' Nights ' " is 
a bold one to make so soon after the publication 
of anew edition of Lane's stUl popular selection. 

Again, concerning Burton's long poem, " The 
Kasidah," Mr. Dodge says : " It seems to have 
enraged the latest of Burton's biographers, 
Wright, who devotes more than a couple of pages 
in his second volume (pp. 20-22) to abusing it." 
To an unprejudiced reader there is neither rage 
nor abuse apparent in the pages referred to ; and 
near the close, after citing two couplets that 
" flash with auroral splendour," Mr. Wright so 
far subdues his alleged wrath as to remark that 
" neglecting the four reaUy brilliant lines, the 
principal attraction of The JTasulali. is its redo- 
lence of the saffron, iuimeasurable desert. We 
snuff at every turn its invigorating air ; and 
the tinkle of the camel's bell is its sole and per- 
petual music." 

That Burton's conterapoi-aries often failed to 
recognize his genius, and that his coimtry 
refused him the honors and the offices that were 
heaped upon lesser men, is not to be disputed. 
An excess of the fortiter in re and too little of 
the suaviter in modo, in Burton's character and 
bearing, are accountable for this injustice. It 
is now so freely admitted that he was a bigger 
man than the jealously cautious Foreign Office 
was willing to allow, that there is no occasion 
to make extravagant claims in his behalf. To 
declare him " the pioneer of African explora- 
tion," for example, does violence to history. 
Livingstone (to name no others) had already 
discovered Lake Ngami and crossed South 
Africa from Zambesi to Loando some years 
before Burton started to explore the Dark Con- 
tinent in quest of the sources of the Nile. 
Coming to the question of his hero's purity of 
morals, the eulogist gravely declares that 
" Burton throughout his life was a moral man. 
Whether his morality was mental or tempera- 
mental matters little. The fact remains." 
Without puzzling over the exact distinction 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



115 



between mental and temperamental morality, it 
is pleasant to believe that the author of " The 
Scented Garden " was chaste in thought and 
word and deed : and perhaps we are as free to 
hold this belief as to maintain with Mr. Wright 
that in his early East Indian days, " like the 
rest Burton had his Bubu." But what grounds 
for confidence in so private a matter does either 
writer possess ? 

Enough about the book ; now let us have a 
taste of its style as illustrated by a few typical 
passages. Of Burton at Damascus we read : 

"No British Consul in a great Oriental town ever had 
half the power or influence wielded by Richard Burton, 
and had the Foreign 0£Bce appreciated the benefit to 
British prestige gained by his exertions the whole his- 
tory of British policy in the near East could have been 
different; England might have had an ambassador at 
Constantinople who would have had the ear not only of 
the Commander of the Faithful, but that of the Shaykh- 
ul-Islam as well. With one class in Damascus Burton 
was at once on bad terms. He would have nothing to 
do with the Jewish money-lenders who flourished there 
under British protection, and declined to allow his 
Consulate to be used as a debt-collectiug agency. The 
Hebrew usurers resented this, as they had foimd earlier 
consuls more pliable, and at once began to plot for his 
recall. Indeed, this was the foimdation of that unholy 
alliance between the Shy locks of Damascus and the 
pitiful British missionary cabal at Beyrout, the alliance 
that ultimately resulted in the recall of the most bril- 
liant and successful consul Great Britian had ever had 
in the Orient." 

Soon after this came the appointment to the 
consulship at Trieste, in succession to Charles 
Lever, who had just died at his post, as did 
Burton eighteen years later. 

" To offer a man with the fame of Burton a small 
dull Consulate like Trieste after his great ser^-ices was 
no less than an insult; but Burton showed his pluck by 
accepting it without complaint, hoping that it might 
prove a stepping-stone to the Eastern Embassy he 
longed for but never obtained. Had Burton been an 
American he would have had the English mission, or 
later would have been Governor-General of the Philip- 
pines. Being an Englishman, he took what he could 
get and was as thankful as his sardonic humour woiild 
allow. The greatest Orientalist of his age became 
Consul at Trieste, where Lingua Franca and bastard 
German were the tongues understanded of the people! " 
At least one thing, then, this imdervalued 
genius hatl reason t» be thankful for — only he 
didn't know it. Xot being an American, and 
not living into the present century, he was 
sparetl the dreary task of trying to impose an 
Anglo-Saxon government upon a Polynesian 
people. 

The unconscious humor of Mr. Dodge's clos- 
ing page tempts to further (and final) quotation. 

" No one who reads all the so-called ' Lives ' [of 
Burton] can help a feeling of distressed wonder at 
these squabbles in print over unimportant pomts of 



detail. - Burton — who thought Imperially — would 
have brushed them aside with a reference to the gossip 
of the servants' liall. It takes a great man to write the 
life of a great man, and there are few such ' Lives ' ! 
In spite of the differing accounts of his career, now 
over-flattering, now venomously friendly, he will be 
judged fairly by posterity — tliis most fascinating 
ancient among the modems." 

Like his hero, Mr. Dodge indidges in occa- 
sional odd or archaic terms, as for instance, — 
coolth, travestation, knowledged, and mote (past 
tense of might). He also sanctions by his use 
the time-honored misquotation, "fresh fields 
and pastures new," and he or his printer gives 
us the strange word " encyclopaedic." The 
only portrait offered of the " real " Sir Richard 
is a curious and not easily recognizable cartoon 
from " Vanity Fair." However, it may repre- 
sent the genuine Burton whom we have never 
before encountered. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Tragkdy of the Puritan Revolu- 
Tiox ix Dialogue.* 



The volume entitled " From King to King," 
by Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson, is made up of a 
series of dialogues assigned to various significant 
moments from 1632 to 1662, from the impris- 
onment of " lion " Eliot to the execution of Sir 
Henry Vane. On the purpose in our author's 
mind, the preface throws this light : 

" The pages that follow contain an attempt to state, 
in a concrete form, certain universal aspects of a par- 
ticular period of history. The tragedy lies in the 
conflict of reforming energy with actnal men and insti- 
tutions; and it has been the object of the author to 
delineate vividly the characters of leading actors in the 
struggle, their ideals, and the distortion of these as 
reflected in the current of events. . . . The dramatic 
form was deliberately chosen because that of aa essay 
appeared insufficient." 

In other words, the dramatic dialogue was to be 
tried as a form of essay ; and we need hardly 
say that such an experiment in the hands of 
Mr. Dickinson coiUd not fail to be worth a 
fairly careful examination. 

Perhaps, then, one's first clear conclusion is 
that our author has chosen a most suitable his- 
torical epoch for his purpose. The future of 
responsible government and of the individual 
conscience was upon the razor-edge of Fate ; 
complicated and important issues were met by 
divergent and interesting personalities ; and 
within such a period it is not hard to select 
dramatic moments or impressive characters. If 
we turn to the second dialogue, we find Laud

116 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



and Chillingworth as the principal interlocutors, 
and the date as June 30, 1637. First we have 
an attendant's vivid account of the moving 
scenes at the piUorying of Bastwick, Burton, 
and Prynne ; and we recall that Mr. Trevelyan, 
in his readable presentation of " England under 
the Stuarts," is inclined to take this ill-timed 
punishment as the beginning of the revolution. 
Then follows an interchange of thoughts between 
Laud, the thoroughgoing formalist and prelate, 
and Chillingworth, the academic moderate, who 
looks upon the world from a student's window. 
In five pages both men are put before us in 
their essential features ; but naturally Laud is 
the more prominent. Here is a type — the man 
who believed with all his vital powers that the 
life of religion depended upon its forms, and saw 
in the church, as Professor Gardiner suggests, 
not a temple of the spirit but the palace of a king. 
" Men are governed by custom rather than convic- 
tion. . . . He who is accustomed to bow his knees will 
the sooner learn to humble his heart. ... As there is 
one truth, so should there be one observance. . . . 
Maintaining the authority of the church, we maintain 
the bond of all society. ... If we fail (which God for- 
bid!) the state fails with us. The Monarchy stands or 
falls with the Church, England with the Monarchy." 

And so, with Strafford, he drove along the fate- 
ful way. 

A review of the remaining dialogues woidd 
show no less felicity of choice. For instance, 
the captions of the ninth and tenth chapters 
are : " The King and his Groom of the Cham- 
ber, Thomas Herbert, at Newport," and "John 
Lilburne before the Council." The tenth, 
" Strafford and his former tutor, Gi'eenwood, 
in the Tower," recalls Browning's drama, 
perhaps more happy in subject than successful 
m execution. But Mr. Dickinson has been too 
wise to limit himself to major personages ; and 
in " The Camp of the Parliamentary Troops at 
Naseby " he has given us some suggestive minor 
characters. Here, along with other types, we 
have the formal Presbyterian minister quoting 
Scripture interminably for a purpose, in sharp 
contrast with the sturdy soldier who has fought 
and felt too much to speak by the book. " We 
wiU set up our congi-egatipn in the fields, and 
our liturgy shall be the promptings of the 
heart " has the ring of such hearts as we like to 
think of in the " New Model " army. 

In the second part of the same dialogue we 
have an opportunity to ob.serve how our author 
can weave description into his general plan. In 
many ways, Falkland is the most interesting 
character in the whole period, — "one whose 
purpose by two much thought was vexed but not 



perverted, " who knew that the tumultuous tide 
of Fate may drive the little bark of man over 
strange seas to strange shores or may whelm 
it in the deep. It is with all conscientiousness 
that " the impeacher of Finch, the shaker of 
Strafford, the putter to shame of bishops " be- 
comes the faithfid minister of a faithless king. 
And it is thus we leave him at the end of the 
sixth dialogue. Then in the above mentioned 
section we have the following : 

" First Officer. — ' I know him; he was a wise man.' 
" Second Officer. — ' On the wrong side.' 
" First Officer. — ' If so, he had at least tlie grace to 
be imhappy there. They tell me that as the war pro- 
ceeded he lost his wonted cheerfulness, neglected his 
dress, grew careless of food or drink, spoke not at all, 
or only with a sliarp intemperance; and, starting at 
whiles from melancholy reverie, would frecjuently in- 
geminate the burden " Peace! Peace! " In battle, as he 
was careless of danger, so he cared not to kill, but 
rather to succor the wounded, till at last, as one who 
was weary of life, he deliberately laid it aside in tlie 
thickest of the fire at Newbury.' " 

With the help of this passage we see clearly 
the man whom even Clarendon had the gi'ace to 
love ; and it is perhaps no accident that our 
author borrows a line from that flagrant par- 
tisan's i-emarkable history. 

Thus far our quotations have happened only 
upon prose ; but in nine of the thirteen dialogues 
blank verse is freely employed, in most cases 
with success. Mr. Dickinson must have studied 
this phase of seventeenth-century literature very 
profitably ; for he has succeeded in putting ap- 
propriate verse on the lips of his different char- 
acters. Indeed, there is as much difference in 
the metrical speeches assigned to MUton and 
Cromwell as in their prose utterances. To 
show how happUy our author has caught the 
Miltonic breath, we may be allowed to make a 
brief quotation. 

"To sucli [the heavenly choir] attune, though weak, my 
mortal voice 
That, while this island nation, bom anew, 
A golden eagle, beats her dauntless wings, 
Undazzled, full against the blaze of noon, 
I, with not too presmnptuous aim, may sing 
Her praises right, nor, honoring her, forget 
To celebrate, as due. Thee, sole Supreme, 
Thee first. Thee last, and Thee eternally." 

An examination of the whole passage would show 
more instances of the hypermetric syllable than 
we should find in a simQar number of Milton's 
lines ; but the imitation is still a rather remark- 
able performance. Space forbids, or we coiUd 
adduce not a few other passages of real merit 
and attractiveness. We knew that Mr. Dickin- 
son was a master of prose ; apparently he might 
have written admirable verse.

THE DIAL 



117 



However, all criticism of the work must re- 
turn to the question of the success of the dra- 
matic dialogue as an essay form. Some kindl}- 
critics have already spoken of the production as 
"closet drama'"; but surely this loses the point 
of view. Mr. Dickinson is primarily an essayist ; 
and the present volume is simply a variant in 
form. On the whole, one finds himself inclined 
to decide that the experiment is successful ; for 
the dialogue has enabled our author to realize 
his hope of effectively setting forth the clash of 
the individual with a movement. At times we 
wonder whether Mi*. Dickinson has secured the 
unity which he aimed at ; but he himself saw that 
he was writing for readers having a general ac- 
quaintance with the period, and for such readers 
liere would be no urgent need of the intimate 
bond of plot demanded by the drama. That 
he could not have accomplished so much by 
the same number of pages in any other essay 
form, we are inclined to believe; so that from 
the critic's point of view the dramatic dialogue 
is justified. 

And yet there is a little reserve about one's 
commendation of the book as a whole. In the 
first place, it can appeal only to a much nar- 
rower circle than most of Mr. Dickinson's other 
productions, and he is too able a writer to be 
excused for atldressing hiuLself to an audience 
in any way circumscribed. In the second place, 
there are occasional suggestions of the cold lit- 
erary exercise. " We talk like rhetoricians," 
cries Cromwell, in bitterness, to Vane ; and there 
is a dangerous tang of truth in his words. 
Perhaps it is the influence of Mr. Dickinson's 
foreseen audience, perhaps it is an academic 
preoccupation with his art ; but occasionally 
his production borders on the faultily faiUtless. 
Let us glance at one excerpt : 

" Milton. — ' O sir, the title were an honor indeed. 
The poet is he who understands the world in its essence 
and origin, Love. The beauty he perceives and cele- 
brates is the final expression of truth; and that which 
action and philosophy forever seek, he in a moment 
arrests and fixes in enduring lineaments. His life 
passes out of himself into the larger life of the whole, 
whereby he is turned insensibly to virtue, following 
from the necessity of his nature the maxims the mor- 
alist enjoins. His aim and achievement is immortality, 
so that even while yet in the bonds of the flesh, he is 
rapt at whiles into the heaven of heavens, catching 
sound of those eternal harmonies, whose echoes alone 
inform his vital and inevitable numbers.' " 

It is absolutely flawless ; but it is not in the 
personal and living style of "A Modem Sym- 
posium " or the " Letters from a Chinese 
Official." 

The preface of this work tells us that the 



first edition appeared in 1891, and one imme- 
diately concludes that Air. Dickinson's subse- 
quent success was not at all strange, if he could 
write so well sixteen years ago. However, a 
personal note from the publishers states that 
the dialogues have been " largely edited and in 
some places re- written." In any event, it is 
safe to say that to most Ailierican readers, as 
to the present WTiter, " From King to King " 
is entirely new ; and that in this country it will 
be thought of as belonging to the author's later 
works. The volume will be a source of genuine 
pleasure to Mr. Dickinson's old admirers, as 
well as to a few new readers who are interested 
in the Puritan revolution ; it will not materially 
\*'iden his circle, nor does it represent his highest 
possibilities as a factor in the molding of con- 
temporary thought. Y. B. R. Hellems. 



ExGLAxcs Colonial, Campaigns 

rV A3IERICA.* 



William Pitt, the elder, was Secretary of 
State in England from 1757 to 1761 — four 
years memorable in the history of the English 

I people. They laid the foundations for the Brit- 
ish empire in India, decided the long contest 
for supremacy between the British and French 
nations in America, and drove the French 

; from the Mississippi Valley. They embrace 
the victories of Louisburg, Ft. Duquesne, and 
Quebec. The participation of the American 
colonial militia in these campaigns taught them 
the higher arts of war and inspired in them the 

• confidence that enabled them, nearly a score of 
years later, to face the British regulars on the 
slope of Breed's Hill. The large drafts for men 
and supplies during these wars persuaded the 
colonies that they had contributed more than 
their just share for the defense of the realm, 
and this feeling was largely responsible for the 
resistance to the .stamp-tax at a later time. 

In the conduct of the American campaigns, 
the colonial and military governors acted as 
representatives of the crown, and were in con- 
stant correspondence with Pitt as Secretary of 
State. The letters comprising their correspon- 

1 dence bear on many parts of American history ; 
and for this reason the National Society of 
Colonial Dames of America has rendered a use- 
ful service in making possible the publication 
of copies of the letters, edited by Miss Gertrude

Selwyn Kimball, already favorably known as 
editor of the correspondence of the Colonial 
Governors of Rhode Island. The originals of 
the letters written to Pitt are pi-eserved in 
the Public Record Office in London, and those 
written by him are preserved in a clerk's hand, 
in a duplicate dispatch book. Of the 507 let- 
ters covering the period, 114 were rejected by 
the editor as unimportant, leaving 493 printed 
in the present volume. Of this large number 
of letters, only 68 have heretofore appeared in 
print, — a statement which at once shows the 
value of these volumes to the student. Pitt wrote 
170 of the letters, and the remaining ones were 
written to him. The letters are preceded by 
an excellent historical sketch by the editor, 
touching on the chief events with which the cor- 
respondence is concerned. In copying the letters 
the spelling and punctuation have been followed, 
giving them an added air of authenticity. 

Upon nearly every page of these volumes the 
reader gets a glimpse of the difficidties of con- 
ducting military campaigns in the New World. 
The constant bickering between the Governor 
and the Assemblies in the several colonies over 
the voting of supplies to the home government, 
the reluctance of the Quakers to assist in the 
war, and similar sources of friction, are every- 
where revealed. The Governors complain of 
the " refractoriness " of the Assemblies, and of 
the Friends who write to the Indians begging 
them to remain neutral, while the British wish 
to use them against the French. Wealthy 
colonists who enlisted their indented servants 
were keen in demands for their bounty and pay. 
Military expeditions were obliged to establish 
depots of supplies forty miles apart along their 
line of march, because the country was unin- 
habited. The Indians were " like sheep, — 
where one leaps aU the rest follow." Governor 
Dinwiddie of Virginia apologizes for sending 
Indians on a scalping foray against the French, 
declaring it " a barbarous method of conducting 
war, introduced by the French, which we are 
obliged to follow in our own defense." 

Evidence of the discrimination constantly 
practised between the British regulars and the 
colonial militia are not difficult to find. A 
commandant advises that Fort Cumberland, on 
the Potomac, be garrisoned by militia rather 
than by regulars, because the fort could not 
withstand an attack, and its capture when 
guarded by provincials would be " less an affair 
of Eclat " than if garrisoned by the King's 
troops. Instances are found of the difficulty 
the Governors experienced in trying to deter 



settlers from advancing beyond the safety-line 
on the frontiers ; and there are interesting 
glimpses of the Acadians, and of their dispersal. 
Franklin's name appears as a prominent citizen 
of Philatlelphia, and General Israel Putnam 
plays an important part ; but one looks in vain 
for the name of Washington, although he was 
actively connected with the taking of Fort 
DuQuesne. 

Teachers and students of early American 
history owe to the patriotic society of women, 
and to Miss Kimball, their thanks for making 
available these interesting records, and for 
pointing a way which other patriotic organiza- 
tions may profitably follow.

Choick Facts Choicely Embellished."' 



It seems little short of rudeness, in the face 
of such sumptuous volumes as these on Canada, 
Cambridge, the Thames, and Paris, to recall the 
old lady who entitled her commonplace book 
" Choice Facts." But after reatling the texts 
one cannot help recognizing the appropriateness 
of her title as a criticism. Why cannot people 
who write about places remember that in them- 
selves places are not very interesting to read 
about, and that art must supply what the in- 
trinsic nature of the subject lacks ? A place 
used as a background has the perspective of 
human interests, but a place brought into its 
own foreground and made the whole subject of 
the picture has the flat appearance of a child's 
dra^ving, with one feature following another in 
purely surface succession unless through some 
principle of relation the artist focuses and 
embosses. It is the lack of such a principle that 
leaves these four handsome books mere colloca- 
tions of facts, more or less " choice " according 
to the selective power of the writers. One feels 
the absence of artistic unity in the text all the 
more because of the beauty of the book-making. 
Paper, print, binding, and illustrations are as 
perfect as may be. Indeed the pictures, which 
are colored reproductions of paintings, are so 
numerous and beautifid that to certain minds 
they will constitute the chief merit of the books,

and cause the text to be looked upon as mere 
padding. 

In compiling his work on Canada Mr. Wilfred 
Campbell must have had occasion to echo ilr. 
Crothers's complaint that '• the trouble with 
facts is there are so many of them." He 
deserves especial praise for selecting well from 
such a mass of material. The value of his book 
to the ordinary reader is that it brings together 
various kinds of information which without it 
would have to be gathered from many sources. 
Thfere is a little history, a little biography, a 
few statements of political and economic prob- 
lems, woven together with considerable descrip- 
tion and numerous quotations of poetiy. Mr. 
Campbell's original work is mostly in the 
descriptions, many of which are very good. It 
is scarcely fair to quote detached sentences, but 
the spirit of the descriptive passages is well 
illustrated by these extracts from some pages 
on the forests : 

" The beech-wood is purely Greek in all of its spirit 
and characteristics. There is something about the 
beech-tree itself, in all its form and character, which 
suggests statuary — the pure smoothness and perfection 
of trunk and limb ; the firmness of the leaf, with its 
copper-brown in autumn, which suggests beauty in 
form, and delicacy of color and finish in outline. It 
suggests culture, outward beauty, simplicity, and finality. 
. . . How different it is from the beech-wood in the 
shade of the mighty elm, the maple and the bass-wood ! 
Here the sense felt is purely Gothic. The sense of 
beauty, form, and finality is lost in reverence, sublimity, 
vastnesB, and infinity. . . . Far different from the 
others is the identity of the pine-forest. As the beech- 
wood is Greek in its suggestion, and the maple and elm- 
wood Gothic, so the pine-wood is in its whole character 
distinctly Celtic. Everything here suggests withdrawal 
and seclusion, that almost childish pride in self which 
is so true of the Celt. There is that shadowed gloom 
which seems to hold an imagination peculiarly its own. 
.\nd the sunlight which reaches these deeps seems to 
stab with a passion that only the true Celt can feeL" 

There is some clear exposition of government 
problems — that of amalgamating the French 
Canadian, •' whose ideals, race-traditions, and 
loyalty to all that is French must be left alone," 
and that of importing cheap labor to British 
Columbia, where the United States labor boss 
continues to step in. The tone of enthusiastic 
loyaltj- which pervades the book will commend 
it to more than a Canadian audience. But its 
first claim to popularity rests on ilr. Martin's 
beautiful " pictures," some eighty in all. 

Mr. BeUoc attempts a task almost equally 
difficult in the history of the Thames. His plan 
is to give a scientific account of the effect which 
the conformation of the banks and the location 
of fords has had upon the growth of towns and 



the movements of armies, then to give an account 
of a few important places — Oxford, Windsor, 
London Bridge, and the Tower, — and then 
to trace the economic development of the valley 
which was brought about by the founding of 
the great monasteries. He has interesting 
things to say on these subjects, but in spite of 
evident efforts to the contrary he becomes in- 
volved in the tangle of the Thames's history 
with that of England, and ends in a tedious 
recital of the destruction of the monasteries, 
which has little to do with his subject. As a 
result his writing is likely to be looked upon 
only as a pretext for the pictures. These in 
themselves are an entertainment, though one 
tires somewhat of the over-refined and some- 
times affected coloring. 

Mr. Tuker's book on Cambridge is by far the 
most seriously important of the group, and will 
at once be recognized by students as a valuable 
work. But from the standpoint of the reader who 
likes to exereise his •' pleased attention " it is a 
disappointment, because the title rouses anticipa- 
tions of enjoyment which are not fulfilled. Is 
it only the siunmer mania for being entertained 
that makes one long to see the genius loci of so 
tmiqne and significant a place evoked as a real 
presence? It would take a wizard touch, cer- 
tainly, to bring forth so complex a spirit, but 
the truly trusting mind thinks that the thing 
might have been done. Instead, we have two 
hundred pages — more than half the book — 
of facts, facts, facts, about the founding of 
colleges and the conferring of d^rees, with only 
a breath of suspicion now and then that a genius 
of any sort lurks behind them. Yet that ilr. 
Tuker feels the presence of a " spirit of the 
institution " is occasionally made evident by 
such a paragraph as this : 

" Cambridge has always suggested a certain detach- 
ment; neither zeal — perfervid or sour — nor the 
pressure of tradition upon living thought has had its 
proper home there. It has not represented monastie 
seclusion nor hieratic exclusion, and it did so at this 
moment of its history [Chaucer's time] less than ever. 
The dawn of the coming renascence shone upon the 
walls at which we have keen looking. The modem 
world has been bom of the birth-pangs which have 
since convulsed Europe, and the walls which were then 
big with the future are now big with the past. But it 
is the greatness of Cambridge that amidst the midtiple 
snggestiveness of its ancient halls of learning, tyranny 
of the past has no place. About it the dawn of the 
renascence still lingers; and the early morning light 
which presided at its birth still defies the shadows and 
seems to temper the noon-day heat, as light and shade 
alternate in its history."

THE DIAL. 



[Sept. 1, 



if Mr. Tuker had chosen to do for Cambridge 
what Mr. Shaff has just done for the Spirit of 
Old West Point ! Still, one cannot quarrel 
with an author's purpose, and if Mr. Tuker 
chose to write a reference book instead of evok- 
ing a spirit, perhaps there is nothing to say 
except that he has performed his task well. 
Only, in giving up the contention, the critic 
may perhaps ask why the chapters on the 
" regulai' " colleges could not have been made 
as interesting as the closing chapter on Newn- 
ham and Girton, and why some of the men 
could not have been presented as clearly and 
memorably as is Miss Clough. 

The book on Paris by Mr. Menpes — or 
perhaps we should say by Miss Menpes, since 
the father attributes the text to her — is much 
smaller and less elaborate than the others, but 
much nearer the ideal in interest. The pictures, 
too, are even more successful than in the other 
books, because of greater depth of color and 
originality of treatment. There is no attempt 
at history, but only the purpose to present the 
city of to-day. The method is fragmentary, 
the style discursive. Chapters on the fas- 
cination of the city, the joy of life, children's 
pleasures, art and artists, are interspersed with 
descriptions of boulevards, cafes, and suburbs 
with no attempt at correlation. Yet there is 
the vividness of actual impression, the realizar 
tion of activity, color, gaiety. One can see the 
Rue St. Honore on a summer morning, where 
perfectly di-essed women, followed by pet ter- 
riers in " costumes " of the same color as their 
mistresses', enter shops to inspect hats of a 
" daintiness, crispness, and innocent freshness 
peculiar to the boulevards"; where the men 
walk in groups chatting and laughing, not 
morose and intent as in other cities ; where the 
horses of rich or titled ladies stand for hours 
waiting before a great dress-making house, and 
only the actress' carriage is i-eceived and dis- 
missed promptly ; where perhaps a pi-ocession 
of the blanchisenses goes by, " each laundry 
sending its chariot, with its queen and her 
court "; or possibly " a little cortege, sad-colored 
in the midst of so much gaiety, passes," and 
every hat is taken off, " as if a magic impidse 
had passed over Paris, leaving every head bare." 
The scene is infuiitely varied, but always fas- 
cinating, and always full of beauty, for to the 
Parisian " beauty is not a luxury, but a neces- 
sity." It is a great accomplishment to have 
caught as much of it aU within the pages of one 
book as the Menpes have done. Yet there is 
no denying the truth of the statement with 



which they begin the book, that "the picture 
has still to be painted, the poem has still to be 
written, that will present Paris, as a whole, in 
her versatile attractiveness."

Problems of Amekican Democracy.* 



In the view of Professor Reinsch, as set forth 
in his recent work on " American Legislatures 
and Legislative Methods," the present era bids 
fair to rival in historical importance even the 
years during which the Constitution was form- 
idated and set in motion, as the relations now 
calling for adjustment are deeper of reach than 
the matters of institvitional form settled by the 
Fathers. 

" For the present age deals with the coordination of 
our established political system, democratic in form, 
with the powerful economic and social forces which the 
recent past has brought forth and which are oligarchic 
in their tendency. We are livuig m an age in which 
new social categories are being established. It is no 
longer the form, but the substance, of political and 
social life that is being affected, through the creation 
of new groupmgs of power, and through a new correla- 
tion of influences acting directly upon social and 
economic life." 

Accordingly, Professor Reinsch goes more 
deeply into the actual workings of Congress 
and the State Legislatures than is usual in 
works on political science. An introductory 
chapter by Piofessor Bernard C. Steiner deals 
with the constitutional law affecting Congress ; 
but in the remainder of the volume constitu- 
tional forms are referred to only as the basis 
upon which rest the actual processes of legisla- 
tion. Here a large collection of facts, gathered 
from a great variety of sources, are arranged and 
interpreted with a philosophical breadth of view 
that brings out their underlying significance. 
In discussing the influence of the President 
upon legislation. Professor Reinsch passes over 
as a superficial half-truth the view that it 
depends upon the personal element, and says : 

" The liistory of institutions shows that there is a 
deeper current than mere personal influence or legal 
arrangement which determines the rise and fall of the 
power of the various organs of government. ... In

proportion as an institution or magistracy succeeds in 
making itself the index and exponent of the most per- 
vading economic and social forces within the national 
life, its influence rises or falls." 

Of the Senate he says : 

" Any measure which in the remotest manner trenches 
upon the interests of concentrated wealth, which in the 
least impedes the activities of great corporations, has a 
hard road to travel in the Senate. No matter how- 
insistent may be the popular demand, no matter what 
expert cMicensus may t-all for such legislation, it will 
be ignored or endlessly delayed by the Senate, and if 
allowed to pass, will ordinarily be equipped with a few 
unobtrusive amendments, which, however, are often 
efficacious to defeat its main purpose. Should this ten- 
dency prevail, should the Senate allow itself to become 
chiefly a vetoing agency, the result wUl be equal to a 
national calamity. It is a revolutionary act to oppose 
healthy growth, to shut off active currents of develop- 
ment; and the Senate, which by its high position is 
called upon to mediate between classes and between 
interests, is in need of a broader philosophy, of more 
liberal temper, than many of its recent actions indicate. 
Through constantly favoring certain interests, it would 
sharpen existing antagonisms, and might ultimately 
threaten the bursting of constitutional restraints and tl^ 
attempted creation of new and more popular authori- 
ties. Moreover, the Senate onght, from its own point 
of view, to consider that no political body can retain 
permanent influence and power through a purely nega- 
tive policy." 

Rather more than half the book is devoted 
to the State Legislatures. There is a depressing 
chapter on " The Perversion of Legislative 
Action "' which goes to the root of things in 
explaining the political actiWtj' of special inter- 
ests : but the author's conclusions are, after all. 
hopeful. " A little more wakefulness, a little 
more attention to the detailed workings of gov- 
ernment, a more careful scrutinizing of the 
personalities to be endowed v^-ith public power,"' 
he says, " may yield returns and restore to 
tisefulness and public confidence the institutions 
now so generally decried." Something has 
already been accomplished toward improving 
the legislative product by the appointment of 
commissions on tmifomi statute laws, and in a 
few States of committees of revision, or, better, 
of legislative counsel and draftsmen, or legisla- 
tive reference librarians who are more than 
librarians. 

The intimate relations between party bosses 
and those dependent upon them for favors is 
even more vi%-idly set forth by Mr, Frederic C. 
Howe in " The Confessions of a Monopolist."' 
These are imaginary confessions, it is true, but 
are penned so e^^dently with a purpose as to 
leave no doubt that the author intended them 
to picttire typical conditions in the actual world 
of to-day. The narrative follows the fortunes 
of a successftd business man, from the time he 



obtained an exclusive privilege to sell papers 
in his town as a boy, through the period of 
franchise-grabbing, to the exalted positions of 
State Boss and United States Senator, It is 
not pleasant reading — it is too true to life, 
though possibly somewhat exaggerated or im- 
naturally concentrated either for artistic effect 
or for the sake of argument. One instinctively 
wonders why iilr. Howe chose fiction as the 
vehicle for his message on the evils of special 
privilege and monopoly. It is not because fic- 
tion is his natural element, for he is much more 
a master of straightforward argument and of the 
simple statement of facts. Perhaps he sought 
the widest possible audience for this expositicm 
of his convictions ; or can it be that he was not 
sure enough of his ground to state as a general 
condition what he has imagined as possibly an 
extreme case ? At any rate, he is more at home 
in the final chapter, where he sets forth the 
'■'■ rules of the game," t^ian in the thick of the 
story. " It 's not thrift, prudence, or the saving 
of gas-bills, that makes the millionaire "; the 
rules of the game are stated thus : 

" First, let Society woit for yon; and, second, make 
a business of politics. Upon an understanding of these 
rules the great fortunes of America have almost all 
been reared." 

In a volume entitled " The Tariff and the 
Trusts," Mr, Franklin Pierce, of the New York 
bar, presents a formidable array of arguments, 
quotations, and facts, to prove that the pro- 
tective tariff is the mother of monopoly. The 
argument is very one-sided, but is so well put 
together that the stand-patters cannot well af- 
ford to n^lect it. There are chapters addressed 
respectively to the manufacturers, laborers, and 
farmers, sketches of American tariff historj- and 
of the free-trade movement in England, a chap- 
ter cm the tariff in Germany, and one on " pro- 
tective tariffs and public virtue " in which the 
author charges the tariff with corrupting Cmi- 
gressmen. The specific instances of corruption 
he cites are not exactly to the point ; but what 
he says about Senators and Representatives 
voting on tariff bills in which they are person- 
ally interested may tend to make the reader 
feel the hopelessness of a scientific tariff. One 
of the strongest chapters in the book is that on 
" American and English Shipping," in which 
the decadence of American shipping is attrib- 
uted to the denial of American registrj- to ships 
built abroad, and to the increased cost of ships 
and restriction of commerce due to the protective 
tariff. The moral intended to be drawn from 
this chapter, of course, is that a subsidy is not

the proper remedy for this state of affairs. A 
convenient list of the more imjjortant " trusts " 
is given in Chapter II. 

A lecture by Mr. Charles Fletcher Dole on 
" The Spirit of Democracy," delivered three 
years ago before the Twentieth Century Club 
of Boston, has grown in the meantime into a 
book of the same title, wjuch has been pub- 
lished chapter by chapter in the " Springfield 
Republican." Beginning with some well-written 
though well-worn platitudes about " the teaching 
of liistory" and democratic ideals, the author 
sets forth his views of what democracy ought to 
achieve, in a series of chapters on such miscel- 
laneous practical problems as the suffrage, treat- 
ment of crime, pauperism, democracy and the 
executive, the party system, the rule of the cities, 
war, imperialism, the Monroe doctrine, taxation, 
immigration, labor unions, socialism, anarchy, 
religion, education, and the family. Of course, 
the treatment of so many subjects in one small 
volume must necessarily be superficial and 
unsatisfactory. The author shows his open- 
mindedness and independence by indorsing pop- 
ular and unpopular reforms alike, and hence 
every type of reformer may find in this volume 
some crumbs of comfort. These, perhaps, are 
the rea<lers to whom the book will chiefly make 
its appeal ; no hard-headed conservative or skep- 
tic will be convinced by it, for it fails to answer 
their objections, and they may even be inclined 
to think the author something of a faddist. Yet 
it will not satisfy reformers of the " crank " 
type, either ; for it recognizes no panacea, is 
always optimistic in tone, stops short of extremes, 
and lays the emphasis after all on the spirit un- 
derlying outward forms. Mr. Dole would abolish 
political parties if he coidd, but he believes that 
the thing most necessary to make democracy a 
successfid experiment is what he calls " good- 
will," by which he seems to mean an enlightened 
altruism magical enough to overcome the sel- 
fishness and social indifference of faidty human 
nature, and so make good citizens of the ruling 
majority. 

According to President Baker, of the Uni- 
versity of Colorado, the essential problems of 
America are not commercial, political, military, 
or territorial, but are ethical, sociological, and 
educational. Consistently with this point of 
view, his book on " American Problems " is 
divided into three parts, entitled " Ideals," 
" Sociological Problems," and " Education " ; 
yet the ideals and problems discussed are in 
part political. Since the volume is made up of 
addresses and essays, the reader must not look 



for unity in theme or in treatment. Suffice it 
to say that the author firmly believes that the 
world is growing better on the whole, and sets 
forth his belief in an interesting if not sti'ik- 
ingly original manner. This optimistic attitude 
of President Baker, Professor Reinsch, and Mr. 
Dole, notwithstanding the difficulties they fully 
recognize, together with the problems of impe- 
rialism discussed by the latter, recalls Mr. 
Dooley's hopeful dictum : " They 's wan conso- 
lation, an' that is, if th' American people can 
govern thimsilves they can govern annything 
that walks." Max West.

population. globe, it 18 fitting that we should 

know just who we are and where we came from, 
who of us have the best opportunities, behave the 
better, work harder, have the larger families, etc. 
Heretofore, such information lias been locked up 
from the average person in large volumes of gov- 
ernment publications. But now the most interesting 
of the population statistics have been worked over 
and interpreted by Professor John R. Commons in his 
" Races and Immigrants in America " (Macmillan). 
The work is scientific as to method and popular in 
style, and forms a very useful handbook about the 
American population. Professor Commons describes 
the colonial race elements, the nineteenth century 
additions to the American population, the negroes 
and their problems, and questions of race and 
nationality as related to industry, occupations, labor 
unions, city life, crime, health, and politics. In the 
opinion of the author, the inferior races are those 
of the tropics ; these can be assimilated or Amer- 
icanized only with difficulty. The Jews are the 
most healthy of the American people, and the 
negroes least so ; the negroes are the most criminal, 
with foreign-born people coming next; up to this 
time the Germans have come to this country in 
greater numbers than any other nationality ; the 
Scotch-Irish have been, in proportion to numbers, 
the most influential elements in our population ; the 
Irish have proved to be the best fitted to unite 
diverse nationalities under their political leadership. 
These are some of the points discussed, with 
enlightening explanation by the author. It is his be- 
lief that it is becoming more difficult to Americanize 
immigrants, because our population is nearing the 
point of saturation; consequently more stringent 
regulation of immigration is necessary. Race 
problems, we are told, are hostile to true democracy. 
According to the standards set up by Mr. Commons, 
we are far from being a true democracy, the greatest 
obstacle being the presence of the negro race, which 
at present, it seems, will not be assimilated.

Crete is in thoroughly competent hands ; that the 
final results will be tremendously important for our 
knowledge of early Mediterranean history and 
development ; that in the second milleniom B. c. a 
powerful and opulent dynasty held sway in this 
island over a highly civilized community ; that its 
relations with Egypt and the Orient were exceed- 
ing^j- close : and, above all, that the archaeological 
situation for this period has become desj)erately com- 
plicated, and that a few thousand pressing and inter- 
esting questions must remain unanswered for several 
years. Throughout the book. Professor Burrows has 
adhered conscientiously to his plan of setting before 
the classical scholar and general cultured public 
" a dear and comprehensive account of where we 
stand." But the trouble is, we do not stand any- 
where in particular. Indeed, as is implied in the 
preface, " the next month's spade-work " is likely to 
put any book out of date ; and the temporary Itill in 
the excavations can hardly save the present volmne 
from being ephemeral even if opportune. In the

days learning about Provincetown and the earlier 
landing made there by the Mayflower Pilgrims, to 
say nothing of the almost forgotten landing of En- 
glish voj-agers at Pemaquid. Maine, in the summer 
of 1607. The writer speaks of Miles Standish's 
dinner-pot as "rather insecurely mounted on three 
rudimentary l^s "; but of course he remembers that 



I it was a kettle to be hung over the great open fire, 
not a pot for the oven, and the l^s had a good right

gave it as a perpetual jdeasnre-grotmd to the public,

Kennedy Foundation, and treating of the formation 
of public opinion, the ^lics of trade, the ethics of 
corporate management, the wordings of our polit- 
ical machinery, and the political duties of citizens. 
All these subjects are discussed with the writer's 
wonted deamess, force, and good sense, and with 
a first-hand knowledge derived from his early ex- 
perience as a labor commissioner and as a journal- 
ist. Sometimes, as a scholar should, he points his 
moral with an allusion at once witty and learned, 
as in his citations from Aristotle's ** Polities "; and 

I his general tone, that of one impartial and open 

{ to conviction, tends to win assent. His recognition 
of party machines and party basses as practical 
necessities maib him out as not exactly the typical 
''scholar in politics." and his lack of enthusiasm 
for arbitration and for profiV«haring in the com- 
mercial world shows him to be other than a theorist

ter on the citizen's political duties will give the

I he deserts his party. Therefore, if a man's record 
shows that he has been honestly anxious to do public 
service, I am very slow to criticise him for standing 
by his organization through a good deal that is rather 
bad." Excellent though the book is. a little more 
of the " scorn of scorn." the " hate of hate." the love 
of all ideals of even impossible perfection, might 
have been expected — and twenty years ago would 
have been expected — in a New England college 
president's treatment of the subjects discussed.

to be thrown on the matter, and that argument only 
is left. The so-called exjwsure of the forged copy 
of the missing " Cape Fear Mercury," in the period- 
ical and quarterly press last year, shows the lengths 
to which those must go who would add to the facts 
in the case. Mr. Hoyt attempts only to collect and 
examine the existing material. He makes no at- 
tempt to discredit the story that certain resolutions 
were adopted by the people of Mecklenburg County 
in 1775, but thinks the date should be May 31 rather 
than May 20. Then he produces arguments to prove 
that whatever the people adopted could not have 
been " independence " bectiuse it did not secure them 
independence — a polemic situation which much 
resembles a man of straw. This seems to be the 
only myth the author feels called upon to destroy. 
He absolves Thomas Jefferson from the charge of 
plagiarism, in his Declaration of Independence of 
1776. The volume may be regarded as a history 
of the controversy, rather than a history of the 
Declaration. The last page leaves the reader as 
helpless as tlie first, in ability to separate hearsay 
from evidence. But the book is valuable as a history 
of a controversy which has raged for more than a 
century, at one time intensified by sectionalism, 
which has brought a heroic defense from the de- 
scendants of the signers, which has induced forgery, 
and seems as yet no nearer a settlement than when 
it began. The appendix contains valuable documents 
connected with the dispute, while in the volume may 
be found facsimiles of the forged newspaper of 1775 
containing the resolutions, of the spm-ious docu- 
ment lithographed for the anniversary celebration 
at Charlotte in 1892, and of various letters by which 
the " recollections " of the event were written out 
twenty-five years after they occurred. A biblio- 
graphy and an index would have added to the use- 
fulness of the work.

pen-name oi " Vernon L,ee ) are is- 
sued in a second edition by the John Lane Company. 
They are " Genius Loci : Notes on Places," and 
" Pope Jacynth, and Other Fantastic Tales." Though 
the first book is buUt on a more substantial basis of 
fact than the second, the imaginative element predom- 
inates in each, and they may well be grouped together. 
In the introduction to her notes and reminiscences of 
favorite haunts in Italy, France, and Germany, tlie 
writer says of her chosen title : " Genius Loci. A 
divinity, certainly, great or small as the case may 
be, and deserving of some silent worship. But. for 
mercy's sake, not a personification; not a man or 
woman with mural crown and attributes, and detest- 
able definite history, like the dreadful ladies who sit 
round the Place de la Concorde. To think of a place 
or a country in human shape is, for all the practice of 
rhetoricians, not to think of it at all. No, no. The 
Genius Loci, like all worthy divinities, is of the sub- 
stance of our heart and mind, a spiritual reality." 
Her " fantastic tales " are suggested in each instance 



by some scrap of mediaeval legend, or bit of art, or 
relic of antiquity : and the treatment has always 
jwetic grace and romantic flavor, even though the 
supernatural, the weird, and occasionally the grue- 
some and horrible, tend to predominate. As fairy 
tales they are too highly wrought, too much embel- 
lished with learned allusions and far-fetched con- 
ceits, to please younger readers — for whom they 
were doubtle-ss not intended ; but for those who care 
more for exquisite form than solid substance these 
airy creations of a rich and lively imagination are 

excellent reading. 

A new biographical series dealing 
o/i'^eyTca'"^ with the lives of " Leading Ameri-

promising editorship of Professor W. P. Trent. 
The series opens well with " Leading American 
Soldiers " by Mr. R. M. Johnston, whose books on 
Napoleon have shown his training and skUl as a 
writer. Thirteen generals are selected for discus- 
sion, — Washington and Greene from the Revolu- 
tion, Jackson, Taylor, and Scott from the middle 
period. Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, McClellan, and 
Meade from the North, and Lee, Jackson, and J. E. 
Johnston from the South. From fifteen to sixty- 
five pages are given to each subject, including the 
main facts of his life and an outline of his campaigns, 
with intelligent criticism of them. Tliis criticism, 
though briefly expressed, is the valuable feature of 
the book and makes it worth a careful reading, 
especially by those who have accepted the tradi- 
tional opinions found in the popular histories. 
There is necessarily some repetition of facts in the 
ti-eatment of the eight generals of the Civil War, 
but the emphasis is dift'erent in each case as a dif- 
ferent soldier occupies the centre of the stage. 
Volumes of the series are announced on our leading 
scientists, historians, lawyers, novelists, and others, 
to be written by men whose work is known and 
approved. (Henry Holt & Co. ) 

Professor W. C. Bagley's new book 
fhXaiher °^ " Classroom Management " (Mac- 

millan ) will be useful to any teacher 
who has not solved all his practical problems, and 
particularly valuable to the j'oung teacher. The 
great virtue of the book is its actuality ; its material 
has been gathered mainly from experience and ob- 
servation. The writer constantly sums up the best 
expert opinion upon the question in hand, and while 
not without decided opinions of his own, expresses 
them with modesty and fuU recognition of the great 
range of belief upon most practical questions. The 
contents of the book may be suggested by a few 
of the chapter titles : " The Daily Program," " Hy- 
gienic Conditions in the Schoolroom." "Order and 
Discipline," " Penalties," " The Problem of At- 
tention." The thought is sane and illuminating 
throughout, and the form is always clear and strong. 
We know of no other book that will bring more 
varied and abundant help to the teacher in actual 
hand-grips with his task.

XOTES. 



"The Elements of Mechanics." by Jlessrs. VV. S. 
Franklin and Barr\- Macnutt, is a text-book for colleges 
and technical schools just published by the MaemillanCo. 

A volume of "Character Portraits fpoiu Dickens" 
has been compiled by Mr. Charles Welsh, and will be 
published during the fall bv Messrs. Small, Maynard 
&C«. 

Dr. Todhimter has translated into English verse 
Heine's " Buch der Lieder," and the result will be issued 
shortly as one of the volumes in the "Oxford Library 
of Translations." 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a new edition of 
that very valuable work, the " Ancient Society " of 
Lewis H. Morgan. The original copyright Is dated 
jtist thirty years ago. 

The Messrs. Scribner import the latest edition (the 
twenty-second in English) of Baedeker's " Switzerland," 
that book which has been the Alpine tourist's guide, 
philosopher, and friend for half a century and more. 

Still another " .\raerican History " for the use of 
secondani- schools has come to us from the ^lacmillan 
Co It is the work of Mr. Roscoe L. Ashley, the author 
of a series of text-books on civil government which are 
among the best in existence. 

" The Travel Lovers' Library," one of the most suc- 
cessful of the many excellent series published by Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Co., will be augmented this year by a 
work in two volumes on the Umbrian Cities of Italv, bv 
A. M. and J. W. Cruickshank. 

From Mr. David Xutt, London, we have a seeond 
edition of Mr. G. G. Coulton's " From St. Francis to 
Dante," containing a considerable amount of fresh mat- 
ter from Salimbene's chronicle, and many additions to 
the notes and appended matter. 

Palgrave's " Golden Treasury," with one himdred 
additional poems (bringing the collection down to the end 
of the 19th century), is being published in the Oxford 
editions of standard authors. The whole of FitzGerald's 
version of Omar Kharyam is given. 

Mr. John Belcher's " Essentials in Architecture," 
imported by the Messrs. Scribner, is a popular treatise 
which is confined to a few general principles instead of 
being overloaded with details, and which is illustrated 
by a choice selection of photographic examples (rf typical 
styles. 

Volume VII. of the " Proceedings of the .Vristotelian 
Society," published by Messrs. Williams & Norgate, 
includes eight papers read before the Societj- during the 
past vear. Among their authors we mav name the Rev. 
Hastings Ra^hdall, Professor F. C. S. Schiller, and Mr. 
Shadworth H. Hodgson. 

"Steps in English," a book of composition and 
rhetoric, by Dr. Thomas C. Blaisdell; "An .\merican 
Book of Golden Deeds," by Mr. James Baldwin; and 
"iL volume on " Foods." in Mr. Frank G. Carpenter's 
" Industrial Readers," are three recent school publica- 
tions of the American Book Co. 

A set of reprints called the " Indian Captivities 
Series " is being imdertaken by the H. R. Huntting Co., 
Springfield, Mass. The first issue gives us " A Narra- 
tive of the Captivity of Mrs. Johnson," reproduced from 
the third edition, published in 1814 at Windsor, Vermont. 
The volume is supplied with a historical introduction by 
Mr. Horace W. Bailev- The edition is limited. 



The growing popularity ot Richard Jefferies is attested 
bv two new editions of his best-known books — " The 
life of the Fields," "The Open Air," and "Nature 
near London," — annoimced for fall publication. One 
of these sets, with introdoetious by Mr. Thcnnas Coke 
Watkins, wUl be issued fagr Mwwrs. T. Y. Crowell & 
Co.; the other, of English manufacture, will bear the 
imprint of Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co 

The latest issue in the "Old South Leaflets" is a 
" Longfellow Memorial," in which are brought together 
the noteworthy tributes paid to Longfellow at the 
meeting of the Massa^^-hnsetts Historical Society follow- 
ing his death in 1882, together with some of the tributes 
at the meeting in February of the present year, the 
month of the centemiial i-elebration. Longfellow, Em- 
erson, Lowell, and Holmes were all members of the 
Historical Society, and all deeply interested in local as 
well as general history ; and this is impressively shown 
in this memorial leaflet relating to Longfellow. It is 
sold, like all the leaflets, for five cents a copy. 

Meass. Houghton, Mifflin and Co.'s fall season will 
open on September 14, with the publication of the 
foUowing: "The Familiar Letters of James Howell," 
in two volumes, with an Introduction by Miss Agnes

Charles Sprague Sargent's " Trees and Shrubs "; anew 
series of popular poets, in leather bindings at popular

erson, Aldrich, Holmes, Lowell, Hart, Sill, and others;

Eliot Griffis's "Brave little Holland," both in the 
" Riverside Juvenile Claaaics." 

The following detailed information regarding the 
important forthcoming " Cambridge History of English 
Literature " is sent us by the American publishers, 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons: "The work will cover 
the whole course of English literature from Beowulf to 
the end of the Victorian age. Each chapter will be 
the work of a writer who is familiar with the subject, 
and who has been accepted as an authority on his sub- 
ject; while the editors will retain the responsibility for 
the character of the work as a whole. The list of con- 
tributors includes American and Continental as well as 
English scholars. It is intended (1) to give a connected 
account of the successive movements, both main and sub- 
sidiary, in English literature ; this implies an adequate 
treatment of secondary writers, instead of leaving these 
to be overshadowed by the greater personalities; (2) to 
trace the progress of the Enghsh language as a vehicle 
of English literature; (3) to take note of the influence of 
foreign literatures upon English Uterature, and (though 
in a smaller degree) of the influence of English upon 
foreign literatures; and (4) to provide each chapter 
with a snflicient bibliography. The work is intended to 
appeal to the general reader as well as to the literary 
student. Facts that have been duly verified rather than 
surmises and theories, however interesting, are to form 
the foundation of the work. Controversy and partisan- 
ship of every kind are to be scrupulously avoided. It

[Sept. 1, 



is the hope of the editors as of the publishers, that the 
work will furnish a comprehensive, strictly accurate, 
impartial and, as far as may prove possible, impersonal, 
account of the present condition of knowledge as to the 
entire course of English Literature and as to all the mat- 
ters concerning this literature." Messrs. A. W. Ward 
and A. R. Walker are the editors of the work, which 
will be complete in foui'teeu volumes. The first volume 
is announced for early publication.

JUST PUBLISHED 
A new volume of the Variorum Shakespeare 

Antony and Cleopatra 

EDITED BY 

HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Ph.D., L.L.D., Litt.D. 

^T^HE publication of a new volume of Dr. Furness's Variorum Edition of Shake- 
-*- speare is always an event of importance in the literary world, and it is therefore 
with pleasure that the publishers are able to announce the completion of the fifteenth 
volume of this monumental work. This is the first volume to be put before the 
public since the autumn of 1904, when "Love's Labour's Lost" was published. 

The Text of this edition follows the text of the First Folio with all the fidelity 
that unstinted pains can bestow. In addition there are Textual Notes showing the 
different readings of the folios, quartos, and subsequent editions, similar in kind to 
the notes of the Cambridge Edition, but differing herein, that they enumerate the 
critical editions that have adopted the various readings. Then follows a Commentary 
in which the notes, worth preserving (in the opinion of the editor), of critical edi- 
tions from Pope to the present day are condensed — at times, these notes merely 
illustrate the history of Shakespearian criticism. Li an Appendix are criticisms by 
English, German, and French authors— in short, within one volume is to be found 
an epitome of a Shakespeare library that would cost a large expenditure of time 
and money to collect.

nature in many phases and a still fuller love." This, his latest book, is illustrated with thirteen

JESUS, THE WORLD TEACHER 

By JAMES ELLINGTON McGEE 
This book shows Jesus in his relation to various working forces of human life and history. To

well as to him who is trying to interpret Jesus in the largest terms and relations it will be in a real 
sense quite a welcome and helpful book. Freshly thoughtful, full of life and energy.

C There is no need to say anything here of the importance of this work as a contribution to 
American history and biography. Not in years have there appeared the reminiscences of a 
notable figure in American affairs more fascinating and of greater vital interest to Americans 
than these of Carl Schurz. Their publication in McClure'i has been attracting more attention 
than any magazine serial of recent times. 

Q. N'o American since Lincoln shines with so bright a light upon the pages of our history as 
this splendid figure. Ever)- good cause and great movement of reform knew the weight of 
his gifts of leadership and eloquence. His friends included most of his great American con-

By Professor Simoil N. Patten University of Pennsylvania 
The New Basis of Civilization 

He preaches the gospel that the new morality consists not in saving, but in expand- 
ing equipment ; that increased strength, keen interests, and efficiency are a better 
safeguard for the future than a bank account; that the suppression of vice is only 
accomplished by releasing virtue — and he does it in pointed sentences that will not 
be forgotten. Cloth, ISmu, $1M net; by mail. $1.10. 

By Professor Arthur Twining Hadley Yale University 
standards of Public Morality 

He treats with what the Cliiraijo l^ribttnr describes as "a remarkable quality of 
common sense, as rare as it is attractive." the formation of public opinion, the 
accepted ethics of trade, of corporate management, of political machinery ; and closes 
with an inspiring discussion of the political duties of the citizen which is really

Individual Training in our Colleges 

" The average student of to-day does not receive as good preparation for the work of 
aft«r years as he did fifty or a hundred years ago. He is not getting as much value 
out of his college life as he is entitled to. The author has undertaken to show why 
this is true. . . . He has made a strong argument, has won his case, and the book 
should be widely read." — Daily Hveniny Transcript, Boston. 

Cloth, 8vo, $1.75 net; by mail. $1.91. 

By Professor Walter Rauschenbusch of Rochester Theological Seminary 
Christianity and the Social Crisis 

"It is a book to like, to learn from, and ... to be charmed with," said the Xew

ditions of this world into those of the kingdom of God," and. what is more, point* a 
reasonable way. Clutli, svn, ■fh.w net; by mail, $1.6J. 

By Professor Shailer Mathews Chicago University 
The Church and the Changing Order 

The Boston Herald describes the book as " singularly frank and penetrating " in its 
account of the reasons why the Church seems to be losing its hold upon the people, 
while at the same time the religious instinct seems to be as strong as it ever was. 
His topics. Scholarship, Brotherhood, Social Discontent, Materialism, are those upon 
which such sane, modem thinking is greatly needed.

cordance with our annual custom) a few of the 
books which are likely to be awaited with some- 
thing more than ordinary eagerness. Our selec- 
tion is confined to the five categories of general 
literature, history, biography, poetry, and fiction. 

Among the volumes scheduled for early ap- 
pearance probably none is more important than 
those of the " Cambridge History of English 
Literature," under the editorship of Messrs. A. 
W. Ward and A. R. Walker. This work, long 
in preparation, is upon the plan of the " Cam- 
bridge Modem History," and will extend to 
fourteen volumes. It will be the work of many 
hands, for the subject has now far outgrown the 
cajMcity of any single scholar, and the opening 
volume. '■ From the Origins to Chaucer," is now 
practically ready for publication. In this con- 
nection, we may also mention ilr. W. Robertson 
NicoU's forthcoming illustrated '• History of 
English Literature," in three volumes. To the 
important " Library of Literary History "' two 
new volumes will be added — one on the Arabs 
by Mr. R. A. Nicholson, and one on Franc-e by 
M. Emile Faguet. We are to have two new 
books, respectively entitled " Great Writers '' 
and " The Appreciation of Literature." by Pro- 
fessor G. E. Woodberry ; and a volume by 
ProfeaBor Barrett Wendell on '• The France of 
To-day" — a direct consequence of the author's 
recent experience as a lecturer at the .Sorbonne. 
A few other books relating to literarj- history 
and criticism are the following : " The Novels of 
Greorge Meredith." by Mr. E. E. J. BaUey ; 
•'Inquiries and Opinions," by Professor Brander 
Matthews ; "Studies in Poetry," by the Rev. Stop- 
ford A. Brooke ; " The Elizabethan Drama," by 
Professor F. E. Schelling : and " The Greater 
English Poets of the Nineteenth Century," bv 
Dr. W. M. Pavne. 

Among works of history, the various sets and

series already in progress make an impoi"tant 
showing, but we will here take them for granted, 
and speak only of new enterprises. Three 
books of allied interest are the " England and 
America, 1763-1783," of Mrs. M. A. M. 
Marks, the " British Colonial Policy, 1754- 
1765" of Mr. George L. Beer, and "The 
Struggle for American Independence ' of Mr. 
Sydney G. Fisher. A subject of peculiar in- 
terest, hitherto almost unexploited, has been 
found by Mr. Justin H. Smith, who has written 
of " Our Struggle for the Fourteenth Colony : 
Canada and the American Kevolution." In 
Roman histoi-y we are to have " Studies in the 
Early History of Ancient Italy," by Professor 
Ettoi-e Pais, and " The Greatness and Decline 
of Rome," by Professor Guglielmo Ferrero. 
A new " Romance of History " series promises 
well, being openetl by Major Hume with 
" Elizabeth and Pliilip ; or, The Whole Story 
of the Spanish Armatla." This shovUd be as 
interesting as Froude, and a good deal more 
trustworthy. The same author is also down for 
a work on "The Court of Philip IV., the 
Decadence of Spain." A few other titles of 
interest are Mr. Sidney Lee's " Call of the 
West : America and Elizabethan England '"; 
" The Mongols," by the late Jeremiah Curtin ; 
" Napoleon and the Invasion of England," by 
Messrs. H. B. F. Wheeler and I. M. Broodley ; 
"The Great Plains, 1527-1870," by Mr. 
Randall Parrish ; and " The Gamesters of the 
WUdemess," a book about the romantic history 
of the Hudson's Bay Company. 

Turning to biography, we find that we may 
soon expect in book form two works that have 
already attracted much attention during their 
publication as serials in the magazines. Readers 
who have followed their serial course do not need 
to be told how thoroughly delightful they will 
find the " Reminiscences of Carl Schurz," and 
" The Spirit of Old West Point " by Mr. Morris 
Schaff. Another announcement of exceptional 
interest is that of the " Memorials of Thomas 
Davidson," the " wandering scholar " whose 
personality made so deep an impression upon all 
who knew him. Mr. EUis P. Oberholtzer's life 
of " Jay Cooke, Financier of the Civil War " is 
another American biography of more sober his- 
torical interest. In English biography, we note 
Mrs. Humphry Ward's life of WUliam Thomas 
Arnold, Mr. Frank Podmore's life of Robert 
Owen, Mr. Edward J. EUis's " The Real Blake," 
and Mr. D. W. Rannie's " Wordsworth and his 
Circle." Three important French biographies 
are M. Jides Lemaitre's Rousseau, Mr. Arthur 



Tilley's Rabelais, and the " Memoirs of Frederic 
Mistral." The " Memories of My Life," by 
Mme. Sarah Bernhardt, and the " Memoirs and 
Artistic Studies of Adelaide Ristori '' are two 
books of allied interest that are sure to be widely 
read. A book ou Petrarch by Mr. H. C. 
Hollway-Calthrop, one on Nietzsche by Mr. 
Henry L. Mencken, and one on Ibsen by Mi-. 
A. Boguslawsky, are three biographies that will 
appeal to students of literature. ' 

It is our usual experience that the best 
new poetry comes miheralded, and we do not 
expect great things from the preliminary an- 
nouncements of the publishers. But we shall 
welcome Mr. Gilder's "The Fire Divine," Mrs. 
Helen Hay Whitney's " Gypsy Verses," the 
" New Poems " of Mr. Stephen Phillips, and 
" The Pilgrim Jester " by Mr. A. E. J. Legge. 
And we shall be particularly glad to see the 
translation of Sig. d'Annunzio's " La Figlia di 
Jorio " and Miss Agnes Tobin's new volume of 
translations from Petrai-ch. 

The novelists we have always with us, and in 
ever swelling hosts. We may select ten from 
each side of the Atlantic as representative ex- 
amples. American fiction will have the fol- 
lowing accessions : " Between the Dark and 
the Daylight," by Mr. W. D. Howells ; " Julia 
Bride," by Mr. Henry James ; " Arethusa," by 
Mr. F. Marion Crawford ; " Santa Fe's Partner," 
by Mr. Thomas A. Janvier ; " Beth Norvell," by 
Mr. Randall Parrish : " The Fruit of the Tree," 
by Mrs. Edith Wharton : " The Beaten Road," 
by Miss Ellen Glasgow ; " The Princess Poui-- 
quoi," by Miss Margaret Sherwood ; " Ances- 
tors," by Mrs. Gertrude Atherton ; and " The 
Bond," by " Neith Boyce." From our " kin 
beyond sea "(never more fully our kin than when 
writing novels) we may expect these among 
others : " Helena's Path," by Mr. Anthony 
Hope Hawkins : " Merry Rockhurst," by Mr. 
and Mrs. Egerton Castle ; " The Broken Roatl," 
by Mr. A. E. W. Mason ; " Mayor Vigoureux," 
by Mr. A. T. Quiller-Couch ; " The Weavers," by 
Sir Gilbert Parker ; " The Secret Agent," by 
Mr. Joseph Conrad ; " The Stooping Latly," 
by Mr. Maurice Hewlett ; " The Helpmate," 
by Miss May Sinclair ; " The Folk Afield," by 
Mr. Eden Phillpotts ; and "The Settlers of 
Karossa Creek," by Mr. Louis Becke. 



The fiftieth anniversary number of the " Atlantic 
Monthly " is to be issued in November. It will include 
articles by three ex-editors — the late Thomas Bailey 
Aldrieh, William Dean Howells, and Walter H. Page; 
and also reminiscent essays by J. T. Trowbridge and 
Charles Eliot Norton.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Tboixope the pbollfic — or. as his readers are 
somerimes tempted to call him. Trollope the prolix 
— is made the subject of an interesting article by 
the editor of "The Bemer Oberland." who visited 
and interviewed the famous novelist's son Henry 
at the latter 's sommer home under the shadow of 
the Jung^frau. " My father had a warm heart for 
America,'' declared Mr. Trollope. •• Of what he 
wrote it is strange that I hear in this obscure little 
place, through which pass many of your fellow- 
countrymen, more keen understanding and delight- 
ful love for my father's books than I ever heard 
from Englishmen. You Americans are wonder- 
fully well informed concerning our authors and 
their works." As to the novelist's literary methods, 
" he once said that he would always give the big 
public what they preferred. — if the public insisted 
on having Lady Glencores and Johnny EJuneses. 
he would continue to manufacture them I He con- 
stantly wrote — wrote — wrote '. He always had 
something ready for a publisher when he called, 
and something to suit. . . . My father could sit 
down at any time and write for hours with hardly 
lifting his pen from the paper. His prolificness was 
amazing. He was a well-read man. He read some- 
thing everj- morning of his life before beginning 
his own composition." His conception of literary 
inspiration is well known. •• As for literary labor, 
he had no patience with those fellows who wait 
for inclination '. In his mind the surest aid to the 
writing of a book is a piece of cobbler's wax on the 
chair — sitting at it and to get at the desk day by 
day ! " Truly Trollope is even more interesting 
than any of his stiU-famous characters, not except- 
ing the wonderful she-bishop, Mrs. Proudie; and 
his way of producing fiction by the pound ever}- 
morning before breakfast, and before his serious 
professional labors of the day, was indeed astonish- 
ing. The wonder is that his stories have as much 
swing and verve as they have. Not one novelist 
in a thousand could keep so excellent a vintage of 
romance forever on tap ; it would grow mustv. or 
tast« of the cask. ... 

OscAK Wilde's revivixg POPtrLAKmr is some- 
thing remarkable, especially on the continent of 
Europe. Trustworthy report tells of his works now 
actively selling in French. German, and Italian trans- 
lation, except that the plays (not including "Sa- 
lome") appear to be less in demand than the novels, 
poems, and es*ays. On the stage, however, the plays, 
especially "Salome," meet with increasing favor. 
Wilde's writings lend themselves readilj- to transla- 
tion. — above all in French, a language that he him- 
self spoke and wrote like a native : and even in the 
heavier German he has found hardly less effective 
rendering. The contrast between the gloomy trag- 
edy of this author's life and the amazing brilliancy 
of his genius seems to possess unfailing charm for 
European readers: and it is characteristic of the 



French to think none the less of his art because of 
the stain on his morals — just as it is equally char- 
acteristic of the Britons to assame a eontrary attitude. 
But even in London the summer now closing has seen 
a successful revival of " A Woman of no Import- 
ance," under Mr. Tree's management, with (actu- 
ally) the pla^-wright's name on the programme. This 
was probably the first public recognition of Oscar 
Wilde in England since his disgrace. Byron and Poe 
are sometimes linked with WUde in literarj- criticism 
and discussion : and it is undeniably true that with- 
out the lurid streak that ran through the character 
of each his genius would not have commanded the 
world's fascinated attention as it has. Genius, like 
sin, has an element of the imaccountable, the irra- 
tional, and it has long been conjectured that the 
two have a mysterious connection that must forever 
baffle our comprehension. Yet few would have the 
hardihood to maintain that the fair flower of genius 
is rooted in iniquity ; rather do we like to believe that 
the highest art and the highest virtue are closely akin.

The Gekmax Librabt Association" displays far 
len energy and zeal when the time for its annual 
meeting comes round than are manifested on corre- 
sponding occasions in this coimtry and England. 
Earnest and active though they may be individu^v. 
and each at his own desk and serving his own com- 
munity, the librarians of Germany do not assemble in 
mukitodes at conventions ; but it would be no hazard- 
ous conjecture to attribute a large part of this seeming 
sluggishness to the pitiful smallness of the German 
library-worker's salary. We recall an assistant libra- 
rian at the Gottingen University Library, who, though 
he was a doctor of philosophy and possessed a wide 
knowledge of literature, received an exiguous stipend 
that would hardly have hired a boy to run for bidoks 
in one of our libraries. Therefore, from the fact 
that only sixtv'-six are reported as attending the late 
convention at Bamberg we need not conclude that 
Bihliatheksweaen is in a parlous state in the Empire. 
A lack of cooperation and associate interest must 
undoubtedly exist where so few of those engaged in 
the same work can manage to rub elbows once a year, 
and where, as we read, out of the eighty persons en- 
gaged in carrying on the Prussian university libra- 
ries, only one delegate was in attendance at Bamberg. 
But for aD that, when it comes to circulating books 
among the people, the German public librarian, as 
we hare already indicated in these columns, shows 
himself no sineeurist. For example, the public libra- 
ries of Berlin, according to their latest annual report, 
issue a million and a third volumes yearly. The 
Chicago Public Library, serving probably a larger 
number of readers, does not very much exceed this.

start in business. A journalist no longer young, 
whose memory goes back to Boston newspaperdom 
of the seventies, has a distinct remembrance of young 
Richard Mansfield doing all-round work on a small 
Boston paper now long extinct. Possibly others may 
be still alive who recall the future actor as haunting 
newspaper offices and as exhibiting far more shyness 
and less haughtiness than characterized his later 
years. These journalistic reminiscences, which have 
lately found their way into the Boston "Transcript," 
speak of the unfledged artist as doing, among other 
newspaper work, dramatic and musical criticism — 
without, however, astonishing the dramatic and mu- 
sical world. But one of his essays in this field did 
attract a measure of attention : it was one wherein 
he aimed the shafts of liis satire at an inanimate, but 
sufficiently conspicuous, target, — the bass drum of a 
theatre orchestra. " Mansfield," we are told, " read 
the pounder of sheepskin a severe and wordy lecture 
on his ignorance of the dynamic value and capability 
of the instrument as exhibited that night at that per- 
formance. That was not the era of detailed criti- 
cisms, and the idea of preaching to the bass drum 
tickled the risibility of the profession, although it 
was natural that the sensibilties of one who was no 
mean musician himself, and the son of a famous 
singer as well, should be acute to defects that other 
critics ignored as all in the day's work." Even 
in this all-but-foi'gotten incident we seem to recog- 
nize the Mansfield of "Richard III." and "Beau 
Brummel " and "Jekyll and Hyde," — the strenu- 
ous insister upon perfection, as he conceived it, in 
every minutest detail. Small sands the mountain, 
moments make the year, and trifles — the finished 
artistic product. ... 

Twenty years of Esperanto have now been 
rounded out, for it was in 1887 that Dr. Zamenhof 
published his invention to the world. Since then 
the tongue has been spreading with cunmlative 
rapidity, hundreds of clubs have been formed for 
its systematic study, two international congresses 
of Esperantists have met, and this mid-August sees 
a third in session. We Americans are especially 
called upon by Dr. Zamenhof to take up Esperanto 
and promote its adoption as a world language. " O 
Americans," he cries, in a pamphlet addressed to us, 
" this language, whose ideal is the future imion of 
mankind, we hand on to you in the name of freedom, 
peace, and justice, for which the forefathers of most 
of you suffered so much." Let us hope that he and 
Mr. Stead may succeed in galvanizing into life this 
ingenious creation of the brain of man, and let us 
also pray that it may not develop into a linguistic 
Frankenstein, a terror to its fellow-tongues of natural 
origin, and a monster ravaging the fair fields of litr 
erature with fearful and wonderful translations and 
still more direful attempts at original composition. 
The cunning of art has gone so far that, as we are 
told, flowers are now manufactured that, for certain 
decorative purposes, are preferable to those that grow 
in garden and hot-house ; yet there is small danger 



that Dame Nature's trade in roses and lilies and 
violets will perceptibly suffer. Likewise we hardly 
need fear that, with the spread of an artificial lan- 
guage, the vernacidar will fall into disuse, or that 
the pleasure and profit of studying a foreign tongue 
will cease to be recognized.

A suggestion for a story of thrilling interest is 
furnished by the recent tragic and heroic death of four 
Russian military baUoonists in the Gulf of Finland. 
The air-ship, sent up for military purposes from the 
aeronautic park near St. Petersburg, was carried out 
to sea with its four occupants, and soon began to sink 
untU the car was in danger of being plunged into the 
water. Thereupon the four balloonists took out a 
Tontine life-insurance policy of a novel sort, whereby 
it was hoped that one or more would profit by the 
death of the remainder, the premium being dear life 
itself. Drawing lots, three of the men, one after 
another as the situation demanded, leaped into the 
sea, thus lightening the balloon and giving it a longer 
lease of life. But the last survivor enjoyed his survi- 
vorship only a short time. He too was drowned, and 
the water-logged balloon, with a written message in 
the car telling the fate of the four unfoi'tunates, was 
picked up by a passing vessel. Without very nmch 
remodeling or trimming, this would make a good 
short story, or an effective chapter in a novel. But 
it would be advisable to let one man survive, and in 
fact to let him tell the harrowing tale in his own 
person. After all, however, is there not something 
cold-blooded and inhuman in making literary capital 
out of that terrible agony in the desolate expanse 
of the northern seas ? How little can any descrip- 
tive powers enable us to realize the horror of such 
an event I ... 

Another projected memorial solicits our at- 
tention and our contributions. It is proposed to 
erect in St. Giles's Cathedral, Edinburgh, a suitable 
monument to the memory of Mrs. Oliphant ; and 
the committee having the matter in charge includes 
such persons of note as Mr. Balfour, Mr. J. M. 
Barrie, Lord Rosebery, Mr. George Meredith, and 
Mrs. Humphry Ward. " Ten years have passed 
since the death of Mrs. Oliphant." we are reminded 
by the circular issued by this committee, " and if 
this test of time is needed to prove the strength of 
a literary reputation, it seems in this case to have 
been successfidly withstood. Her name has not 
grown less in these years : she still holds honorable 
rank among the wi'iters of the Victorian era as prob- 
ably the most distinguished Scotswoman of letters 
the country has produced. In her private life she was 
essentially one of the ' great ladies ' — great in her 
example, great alike in her joys and in her sorrows. 
No doubt her books are her best memorial, but they 
have been erected by herself, and to many of us, 
her admirers, it does not seem well that we should 
any longer deny ourselves the privilege of erecting

The ple.\sa>'t practice of reading aloud is 
one that is now falling into disuse. It may even 
be made an " elegant accomplishment." along with 
piano-playing and solo-singfing, while the wear and 
tear on the nerves of all within ear-shot daring the 
period of learning and practice are vastly less in the 
reader's case than in the musician's, and the chance 
of final success is far greater. The pleasure of each 
one of a congenial circle of sis listening to a sj-mpa-

Gastric disorders result from dining alone, in the cor-

May it not be that many of the crazy whims and 
cranky notions to which the human mind is liable owe 
their origin to the solitary gobbling of books — either 
in the loneliness of one's study or in that more utter 
loneliness that each visitor creates for himself in a 
crowded public reading-room r The point will not 
bear pressing, for we are well aware of the rich 
fruits brought to mellow maturity in the undisturbed 
meditation of the book-lover over his favorite vol- 
visne : but the gains to be derived from reading 
aloud in the family circle — each member taking 
part in his turn — are too ob\'ious to be overlooked,

A Frexch " Old Pepys " has been discovered. 
Henri Legrand, a Beauvais architect of the early and 
middle nineteenth c<nturj\ wrote a diary in forty- 
five volumes : and as he wrot* it in an exceedingly 
complieate<l cipher, put together out of three lan- 
guages, he probably hugged himself in the confident 
assurance that it would never be read, and that its 
writer would enjoy an immortal obscurity. But the 
best-laid plans are surest of being upset. A certain 
Pierre Louyis, a novelist and a man of ingenuity 
and perseverance, is reported to have fathomed the 
mystery of this trilingual cipher and to have inter- 
preted the diary — surely a hermeneutic feat that 
casts in the shade the labors of the Rev. J. Smith 
of Pepysian fame, and the daily achievements of 
the •• blind " man of the United States post-office. 
Legrand's diarj- is said to retail an uncommon amount 
of scandal that was current in Paris society under 
Louis Philippe and Louis Napoleon. It must have 
been something dreadful that required to be dis- 
guised in so elaborate a mask.

has often aroused discussion as to the propriety of 
thus laying bare the writer's inner life and heart-

of more heated dispute over the legal right of publi- 



cation. The promised life of Whistler by Mr. and 
Mrs. Joseph Pennell was recently threatened with 
disaster at the hands of the court to which had been 
referred the right to make public certain information 
contained in the late artist's letters. His sister-in- 
law had brought suit, as executrix of the estate, to 
restrain the Pennells, claiming that she herself was 
authorized to make a selection from this correspond- 
ence for publication after a number of years. Mr. 
and Mrs. Pennell. on the other hand, asserted that 
Whistler had often expressed a desire that they 
should write his biography, and had indicated his 
willingness to place at their disposal whatever ma^ 
terial suited to that end was in his possession. And 
now the court has decided that the Pennells are 
entitled to ujake use of the information in question. 
Whistlerians wiU applaud this decision; but the 
time will probably come, and before very long, 
when some law, written or unwritten, will be made 
to cover, in a more or less precise and restrictive 
fashion, all such cases as this.

Newark readers ; it is freely distributed among the 
frequenters of the library, and the novels it names 
are bought and placed in circulation in larger num- 
bers than ordinary works of fiction. About one- 
eighth of the thousands of novels loaned by the 
library are found to have been selected from this 
official list Mr. Dana, or whoever has drawn up 
this roll of honor, does not claim that it enumerates 
the hundred best novels, but merely a hundred of the 
best ; and they seem to be wisely chosen. Twenty- 
eight living authors are represented, and thirty ^wo 
that live now only in their books. Thirtj'-eight of 
the hundred novels are by writers still in the flesh, 
sixty-two by the illustrious dead. Foreign fiction is 
represented by Balzac. Dumas, Hugo, George Sand, 
Count Tolstoi, and Turg^nief, while German, Italian. 
Spanish, and Scandinavian novelists are ignored. 
But. after all, what universally popular novel — 
popular with English-speaking readers — can one 
name from the countries thus neglected by the 
Newark arbiters? ...

ably voluminous, set of this authoritative publication.

Italy's Gueatest Actress.* 



The recent death of Adelaide Ristori will give 
interest to Mr. Mantellini's new and lavishly 
illustrated translation of her " Ricordi e Studi 
Ai-tistici," which first appeared twenty years 
ago and was immediately rendered into English, 
French, and other European languages. But 
in offering this new version the publishers and 
the translator have not dealt quite fairly with 
the unwary public : they present the book as 
something new. now first translated at the 
writer's request. How else cau we interpret 
the following from Mr. ManteUini's Preface? 
(We retain the peculiar pimctuation of the 
original.) " Her autobiography, I offer ren- 
dered into English to the American public, 
primarily to gratify her own desire expressed 
in one of her letters addressed to Mr. L. D. 
Ventura of San Francisco, California, who 
has graciously volunteered to add some of his 
Biographical Reminiscences as an appendix to 
this work, Madame Ristori says : ' My intention 
is to have my Memoirs published in English. 
Do you believe that such a book would receive 
a welcome in the United States?'" What 
Ristori actually .said m her letter, which is 
printed at the end of the volume, was : " My 
intention is to have the book published in En- 
gland with Italian quotations and original text, 
and vice versa in Italy. . . . Do you believe 
that this book would receive a welcome in the 
United States if I had it published there in 
English ? " This was wi-itten in 1885, when the 
wi'iter was planning a simultaneous publication 
of her book in several languages. The Italian 
quotations that appeared in the original (author- 
ized) English vei'sion have for the most part 
been either omitted or published only in trans- 
lation by Mr. Mantellini. 

Without the Italian original at hand for pur- 
poses of comparison, it is impossible to declare 
positively whether the present version is an im- 
provement on the anonymous rendering which 
was published in London almost immediately 
after the Turin issue of the Italian, and which 
seems to have hatl the benefit of the author's 
supervision and correction ; but frequent in- 
stances of awkwardness in the later version, not 
a few of obvious blundering, and many apparent

departures from the text, tend to inspire in the 
reviewer a lack of confidence in the translator's 
faithfulness and skill. Moreover, the six chap- 
ters of the 1888 version of the " Ricordi " are 
here re-divided into ten, while the six chapters 
of " Studi Artistici " are re-arranged in a dif- 
ferent order. Some attempt, too, appears to 
liave been made, by slight omissions and other- 
wise, to give the memoirs an up-to-date aspect ; 
and these efforts have not always had happy 
re.sidts. But whether the alterations and refur- 
bishings are aU attributable to the translator, or 
some of them to the actress in her later years, 
we cannot say. What makes the volume es- 
pecially welcome at this time is the appended 
contribution from Mr. Ventura (remembered 
perhaps for liis Italian readings in Boston and 
elseivhere, if not for his published writings) who 
was somewhat intimately acquainted with his 
gifted vomj)atriote. From his pen we wiU quote 
a little anecdote showing that, from whatever 
source Adelaide derived her genius, it was not 
from her father. The story may be old, but is 
worth repeating. 

" The father, though a good man, was a poor actor, 
and had very little intelligence. Once when leaving 
Cologne, Adelaide caught him carrying an enonnous 
quantity of quart bottles. ' Papa,' she asked, ' What is 
in those bottles ? ' ' You ought to know,' he answered 
with importance: ' Cologne water.' ' But where did you 
get it ? ' ' Well,' said he candidly, ' from the place 
where other people take it, the fountain in the square.' " 

Daughter of strolling players, Adelaide Ris- 
tori became herself a strolling player in the 
largest sense. Though she at first shrank from 
essaying a rbh in a foreign tongue, her tours in 
foreign lands were many and extended ; and not 
a few must be still alive who saw her in her 
prime on the American stage. She seems always 
to have spoken and ^v^itten admiringly of the 
United States. But of what country or person 
did this great-hearted woman ever indulge even 
an unkind thought ? The subjoined account of 
a rather noteworthy dramatic performance in 
New York is worth reprinting from the closing 
pages of her memoirs. The time referred to is 
the spring of 1885, when Ristori was visiting 
this country for the fourth time, and was playing 
in English, which she had but recently acquired 
after most painstaking exertion. 

" Encouraged by such results [referring to a memo- 
rable Booth-Ristori performance of ' Macbeth '] the 
management of the permanent German Dramatic Com- 
pany, playing at tliat time at the Thalia Theatre in New 
York, offered me the most alluring inducements to play, 
on the night of the 12th, Schiller's ' Mary Stuart ' in 
Enghsh, while the actors of that company who were to 
be my support shoidd play in German ! At first such

a proposition seemed U> me a most preposteroua tmt ! 
I knew not a single word of German. Still, I confeas 
that the originality of the scheme was rather tempting. 
I finally came to the conclusion that by giving a good 
deal of attention to the expression of the faces of my 
interlocutors and with an analogous counterscene at the 
time when I did not have to speak, I might be able to 
get along without becoming confused. After a short 
hesitation I accepted the offer of the management, and 
the strange event was witnessed in America of an 
Italian actreas playing in English with a German sup- 
port ! ... On the evening of the perf ormanc-e every- 
thing went along with regularity, and the performance 
was verv warmly applauded, and — strange illusion — 
the oreater part of the American andienee left the 
theatre fully convinced that I was fa mi l iar with the 
German language ! " 

Ri.stori knew — no one better — that art is 
long. The record of her endless efforts to per- 
fect herself in her various roles would almost 
persuade the doubter that genius is nothing but 
an infinite capacity for taking pains. Her con- 
scientious attention to what might be considered 
trifles is illustrate<l in the following extract 
from 3klr. Ventura's reminiscences : 

" While I was in Boston delivering my annual course 
of Italian readings to a class named the 'Adelaide 
Ristoii,' which used to meet at the home of Mrs. Jack 
Gardner in Beacon Street, Ristori always attended 
during her engagements, and stayed to hmcheon. Like 
Sarah Bernhardt for French. Ristori gave a great im- 
pulse to the study of Italian in the United States. In 
a conversation with Adelaide Ristori I asked why she 
used glasses for reading. ' I like the compliment of that 
question,' she answered. ' My sight became feeble after 
several continuous performances of " Macbeth." In the 
sleep-walking scene for twenty minutes I had to keep 
my eyes wide open, riveted on one point, with the glare 
of the footlights before me. After the performance tears 
would constantly How from my poor eyes, and this 
brought on their present condition.' " 

She has elsewhere written that she did not allow 
herself even to wink in this sleep-walking scene — 
an almost incredible exertion of will-power. 

A letter to ilr. Ventura, written when .she 
was busy with preparations for the publication 
of her book, contains a reference that the reader 
of Mr. Mantellini's translation can easily under- 
stand. 

>^ I shall not excuse my silence by saying that letters 
which I wrote you must have been lost on the Oregon — 
it would be too vulgar. I have not written because I 
have not been able. Many times I had the desire to 
write, but yon cannot imagine how much the publica- 
tion of my book occupies and preoccupies me. I get 
crazy with the English translation because I wish it to 
express what / mean to say, and not to vent the British 
ideas. I have to compare it with the French edition 
liefore passing it to the copyist." 

To the already published lives of Adelaide 
Kistori this new edition of her memoirs, with 
its appended letters coming down nearly to the 
date of her death, is a u.sefid supplement. But 



there is still room for a final. fuU, and critical 
account of the remarkable actress, prepared with 
far more care than the volume under review. 
The frequent occurrence of such errors (small, 
to be sure, but in the aggregate vexatious^ as 
" some later years " for "• some years later," 
•• bagnoire "' for " baignoire." and " proposi- 
tion " for '• proposal," and a conspicuous disre- 
gard of the rules of punctuation, tend to beget 
su.spicion of carelessness in larger matters also. 
In one respect, however, the new translation is 
superior to the old : it is provided with an index. 
It also has thirty-four portraits, of Ristori at 
different ages and in various characters, and of 
contemporary dramatic artists and other celeb- 
rities. Pekct F. Bickxell. 



Thk Presitst Status of Dar-wtxism.* 

Modem biology dates from 1859, the year of 
the publication of Darwin's " Origin of Species." 
This work, with its rig^d adherence to scientific 
method and with its imparalleled accmnidation 
of facts bearing on the life and interrelations of 
species of animals and plants, settled once for 
all the question as to the origin of species by 
natural derivation from preexisting forms. The 
old view of special creation was rel^;ated to the 
history of mystical philosophy. Moreover, in 
natural selection was found the first rational 
explanation of the process by which the trans- 
mutation of species might be accomplished. As 
used by Darwin, the term natural selection, 
referring primarily to the survival of the fittest 
in the struggle for existence, yet included by 
implication aU other natural (that is, non- 

I mystic^) influences which might be supposed to 
cooperate in the same work. The Lamarckian 
principle of the inheritance of ontogenetic char- 
acters, the effects of isolation and sc^rt^tion, 
with other cooperating influences, natural not 

■ metaphysical, were included in the general con- 
ceptionof natural selection. The essential fact 
in Darwin's mind, as he himself has clearly 
stated, was the establishment of the fact of 
descent, his own theory as to its method being, 
to him, a matter of secondary importance. 

The general acceptance of the theory of 
descent by all men competent to judge was due 
to the fact that the work of each of these men, 
under Darwin's inspiration, furnished inde-

jjendent eoiToboration of the views of life Dar- 
win advocated. The theory of descent once 
accepted, the attention of naturalists was next 
directed to the processes by which differentiation 
of type was supposed to be produced. 

The work of Weismann was epoch-making in 
this regard. We owe to him the moi'e rigid 
definition of natural selection, by which the 
Lamarckian element, the supposed inheritance 
of characters not inborn, was eliminated from 
the definition of Darwinism. To Weismann 
also we owe the most successful attempt to give 
a physical basis to our conceptions of heredity 
and variation. By Weismaim, natural selection, 
or Darwinism in the strict sense, was brought 
into the foregi'ound of evolutionary discussion. 
Allmuc/it, or universal potency, was claimed 
for it on the one hand, while on the other there 
were many who relegated it to a secondary place 
or to no place at all in their theories of evolu- 
tion or of species-forming. 

Another epoch-making work in the history 
of evolution, which has received far less atten- 
tion than it deserves, is that of Moritz Wagner 
on the factor of space isolation ( soiulerlirhc 
Hdummif/J, as an element in the production of 
distinct species. Still another ejKJch of inves- 
tigation was opened by Eimer through his 
theory of orthogenesis, and still others of pros- 
pectively gi'cat imjjortance by the revival of the 
investigations of Mendel and by De Vries's 
studies in the mutations of plants. 

In his latest volume, Professor KeUosa- lias 
given a cai-efid digest of each and all of these 
many contributions to the theory of evolution 
since Darwin's time, and of the multitude of 
lines of investigation which these various the- 
ories have suggested. In the matter of pains- 
taking justice the work is deserving of the highest 
praise. Its critical estimates are eminently wise 
and fair, while the literary style of the work is 
admirably lucid. 

Among the shrill voices from Germany in- 
sisting on the one hand on the Allmacht of selec- 
tion, and on the other that the Sterhelnger 
(deathbed) represents the present status of 
Darwinismus, it is fortunate for a layman as 
well as for the investigator to have at hand a 
guide so steady-headed as Professor Kellogg. 

Taking natural selection or Darwinism as a 
" rational causo-mechanical explanation of the 
origin of new species," Professor Kellogg gives 
an analysis of the facts on which this explanation 
rests. Three chapters foUow on " Darwinism 
attacked," the views of those writers " who deny 
in toto any effectiveness or capacity for species- 



forming on the part of natural selection," and 
those who see in natural selection an effective 
factor, but deny to it the ^'■Allmacht of sjjecies 
control " being one after another fuUy consid- 
ered. Professor Kellogg throughout the volume 
avoids any extreme jwsition of his own. Al- 
though from his own work in the exjDerimental 
biology of insects illustrations and opinions are 
freely dra%vn, in general he ranges himself with 
the majority of naturalists, who find very much 
in natural selection but do not see in it the mas- 
ter key to all the riddles of life. He seems well 
aware tliat it is easier to argue against any 
theory than to construct another to take its 
place. It takes but few facts to form the basis 
of destructive criticism ; it takes very many to 
build up a satisfying explanation of any of the 
phenomena of life. 

In the chapters on Darwinism defended, ap- 
preciation is given to the fact that nearly all of 
the objections to Darwinism were foreseen by 
Darwin himself and frankly answered as fully as 
the condition of scientific knowledge permitted. 

Of the various modern defenders of Darwin- 
ism, the first place is naturally given to Ludwig 
Plate (" Ueber die Bedeutung der Darwinischen 
Selection-Prinzip ") whose treatment of vexed 
questions is especially lucid and broad-minded. 

The rest of the volume is given to a discus- 
sion of alternative and auxiliary theories, the 
one a category of hypotheses intended to replace 
the theory of natural selection, the other of 
further hypotheses intended to give the Dar- 
winian theory atlditional strength. Most of 
these hypotheses contain a certain amount of 
truth, which is equivalent to saying that the 
problem is not one resting on the operation of a 
single factor. Most important of these are the 
theories of the effects of isolation or segi'egation, 
of which Moritz Wagner was the most promi- 
nent champion, but which liave received the 
support of practically all serious students of 
geogi-aphical distribution. In Wagner's view, 
this theory rendered unnecessary the conception 
of natural selection, to which fact we may per- 
haps attribute the undeserved neglect his writ- 
uigs have receivetl. Most naturalists at present 
regard the effects of isolation as cooperating 
with those of competitive selection. These words 
of Ortmann express fairly the general attitude 
of students of distribution and isolation : " The 
four factors named, — variation, inheritance, 
selection, and separation, — must work together 
in order to form different species. It is impos- 
sible to think tliat one of these should work by 
itself or that one eoidd be left a-side.'" It is

absolutely certain that no theory- of the origin I 
of species which neglects the factor of isolation 
or which ignores the feots of Wagner. Gulick. 
and their colleagues, can be complete or satis- 
factory. 

Important in the same connection are the 
theories of De Vries and his followers, that 
species originate not from the choice among 
fluctuating ^-ariations (Darwinism), or from 
geographic^ isolation, but rather through dis- 
tinct leaps or saltations, called by De Vries 
" mutations." The modification or final adap- 
tation of species to their environment would in 
either case be a matter for natural selection. 

In spite of the most important study of pedi- 
greed plants inaugurated by De Vries, and in 
spite of the many new fields of investigation 
which his theories have opened, the theorj- of 
mutation as a universal method of species- 
forming, has but a scanty basis, — as compared 
for example with the enormous array of illus- 
trations at the ser\"ice of Wagner and his 
followers. 

Weismann's theory of Panmixia is fidly 
treated by Professor Kellogg, although it is not 
found a very satisfactory explanation of the phe- 
nomena of degeneration of organs. Equally 
unsatis^-tory Professor Kellogg finds the the- 
ory of inherited disuse of parts, and a laige class 
of facts certainly involved in the process of 
evolution are by a sort of common consent left 
without final explanation. Typical of these is 
the inherited blindness of fishes in caves, and 
also the various phenomena the heredity of 
vesrigial structures generally. 

The present status of Lamarckism is fully 
treated, — in one sense s\-mjjathetieally, though 
the author recognizes that no Lamarckian ] 
phenomena-inheritance of characters not con- j 
genital is yet proved in fact. 

^ eismann"s theory of germinal selection, 
De Vries's theory of intracellular Pangenesis, 
and a number of other •• atomic theories '' of 
cell structure are clearly explained. As to 
these the author makes the following wise sug- 
gestion: 

" Thas baldly . . . stated these theories of nltiiiiate 
plasm stmetore . . . show unfortunately onlj llieir 
fanhmtic £iee. For as it i:s in precisely showing how 
the postulated structure and properties are perfectly 
consonant with all the known phenomena of life that 
these theories have their actual interest and strength, 
a fantastic and improbable face shown as to this robs 
them of all interest. ... It is only fair to say that the 
mgenuity und plausibility, the precise and exhanstive 
development of detail of some of these theories, are 
really dangerons to a layman who first happens to read 
a full and well stated account of them bv an enthusiastic 



apholder. One's eyes become closed to the fact that all 
the structure and performauee that seem so natural and 
fit in so exactly with all that we actuaUy know of the 
phenomena of life have not been seen, only imagined.*' 

Finally, we have an excellent discussion of 
Eimer's theoiy of Orthogenesis, and of the 
^•arious related and uncompleted theories which 
try to explain the fact that in palaeontological 
history the evolution of many groups has fol- 
lowed what may be termed straight lines, as 
though there were a pre-arranged or determi- 
nate series of \-ariations. What these facts may 
finally prove to mean is still uncertain, but we 
may agree with the author that Eimer, ill- 
tempered and fond of dispute as he certainly 
was. was a man of the deepest insight and one 
who has earned an honorable place in the his- 
toiy of evolution. As to the realitj- of Ortho- 
genesis and numerous other absorbing problems. 
Professor Kellogg's attitude is that so concisely 
put by Professor Brooks in regard to the dis- 
putes on the existence of \ntal force : '• We shall 
never know until we find out."" 

The value of Profe&sor Kellogg's book to the 
working student of Organic Evolution cannot lie 
overestimated. It is a book the student must 
have at hand at all times, and it takes the place of 
a whole library. No other writer has attempted 
to gather together the scattered literature of 
this vast subject, and none has subjected this 
literature to such uniformly trenchant and uni- 
formly kindly criticism. Pledged to no theory 
of his own, an investigator of the first rank, 
and master of a clear and forceful literar^i- style.

things were possible and nothing was improb- 
able, — were accessible only to a few fortunate 
students ; and it is not the least debt we owe to 
the enterprising Glasgow publishers of Hakluyt 
and Purchas that they have brought these 
fascinatipg records of three hundred years ago 
within reach of every reader. Nothing, too, 
could be more praiseworthy than the manner in 
which the work has been done. With scholarly 
conscientiousness, the publishers have presented 
an exact reprint of the original editions, merely 
altering the obsolete forms of certain letters to 
conform to modern usage, and correcting obvious 
printers' errors. Smith's " Generall Historic of 
Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles, 
with the names of the Adventurers, Planters, 
and Governors, from their first beginning Ano 
1584 to this present 1624," was published in 
London by Michael Sparkes in the latter year. 
The "True Travels, Adventures and Observa- 
tions of Captaine John Smith, in Europe, Asia, 
Affrica, and America, from Anno Domimi 1693 
to 1629," was pi-inted by " J. H. for Thomas 
Slater, and sold at the Blew Bible in Greene 
Arbour, 1630." The " Sea Grammar, with the 
Plaine Exposition of Smith's Accidence for 
young Sea-men enlarged," was " Printed by 
John Haviland," in 1627, in London. The 
first volume of this reprint contains facsimiles 
of the engraved title-page of " The Generall 
Historic," portraits of Frances, Duchess of 
Richmond and Lenox, and of Pocahontas, from 
the same work ; the curious plate illustrating 
Captain Smith's Adventures in Virginia, with 
map of Old Virginia ; and the maps of The 
Summer Isles, and Virginia. The second vol- 
ume has as illustrations facsimiles of the title- 
pages of " The True Travels " and " A Sea 
Grammar " ; the Map of New England, with 
portrait of Captain Smith ; his Arms ; and his 
Adventures among the Turks and Tartars. 
Madame Marie Michon, who was responsible 
for the exhaustive Indices of " Hakluyt's 
Voyages " and " Purchas His Pilgrimes," has 
also prepared an admirably complete and weU 
arranged index to the present volumes. 

John Smith " was borne in Willoughby in 
Lincolneshire, and a Scholler in the two Free- 
schooles of Alford iuid Louth." The exact 
date of his birth is not given, but it was appar- 
ently about the beginning of January, 1579. 
He was not yet out of his teens when the lust 
of travel took possession of him, and from that 
time until. the year 1617, when he finally settled 
down in London to busy himself with the 
encouragement of American colonization by the 



production of maps and pamphlets, and the 
preparation of his more ambitious works, he 
wandered far and wide, throughout all the then 
little-known countries west and south of the 
Mediterannean, and over seas to the land of 
Pocahontas. He died in 1631, at the age of 
fifty-two, twenty-two years of his life having 
been spent in travel. 

It would be fruitless here to enter into the 
question of Captain Smith's veracity as an his- 
torian and autobiographer. The furious wrath 
of eminent scholars has played about that sub- 
ject, and the wise re\aewer leaves it discreetly 
alone. After all, one may as well admit 
frankly that he is much less concerned with 
the value of these books as history than with 
their interest as literature. The facts of his- 
tory are obtainable elsewhere. There are many 
histories, but only one " Historic of Virginia "; 
many autobiographies, but only one " True 
Travels of Captaine John Smith." If John 
Smith prevaricated, he prevaricated boldly. He 
says : 

" I am no Compiler by liearsay, but have beene a 
reall Actoi-. . . . That which hath beene iudured and 
passed through with hardsliip and danger, is thereby 
sweetened to the Actor, when he beconieth the Relator. 
I have deeply liazarded my selfe in douig and suffering, 
and why should I sticke to hazard my reputation in 
Recording?" 

If he was nervous, it was not because of a 
guilty conscience, but rather because he found 
the pen an unfamiliar weapon. Not every 
JiUius Caesar can " shine as cleare in his owne 
Commentaries as in the field." He confesses 
that the hand that was able to " wield a weapon 
among the Barbarous " might yet tremble in 
handling a pen " among so many Judicious." 
Yet he found comfort — in dedicating his His- 
toric to the gracious Duchess of Richmond — in 
the reflection that heretofore 

" Honorable and vertuous Ladies, and comparable 
but amongst themselves, have offred me rescue and 
protection in my greatest dangers. Even in fori'aine 
parts, I have felt reliefe from that sex. The beauteous 
Lady Tragabigzauda, when I was a slave to the Turkes, 
did all she could to secure me. When I ovei-eame the 
Bashaw of Nalbrits in Tartaria, the charitable Lady 
Callamata supplyed my necessities. In the utmost of 
many extremities, that blessed Pokahontas, the great 
Kings daughter of Virginia, oft saved my life. When I 
escaped the cruelties of Pirats and most furious stormes, 
a long time alone in a small Boat at Sea, and driven 
ashore in France, the good Lady Madam Chanoyes, 
bountifully assisted me." 

One so favored might well find courage for any 
exploit — even to the writing of a book. 

And what delightful reading the book makes ! 
What if John Smith did occasionally sacrifice

truth to pictaresqueness : Surely we are the

"They brought him to Meronoeomo, where was 
Powhatan their Emperor. Here more than two hun- 
dred of those griiu Courtiers stood wondering at him, 
as he had beene a monster; till Powhatan and his 
travne had put themselves in their greatest braveries. 
Before a fire upon a seat like a bedsted he sat covered 
with a great robe, made of Raroweuiu skinnes, and all 
the tayles hanging by. On either hand did sit a young 
wench of 16 or 18 yeares, and along on either side the 
house two rowes of men. ... At his entrance before 
the King, all the people gave a great shout. The 
Queene of Appamatuck was appointed to bring him 
water to wash his hands, and another brought him a 
bunch of feathers, in stead of a Towell to dry them: 
having feasted him after their best barbarous manner 
they could, a long consoltation was held, but the conclu- 
sion was, two great stones were brought before Powhatan: 
then as many as could layd bands on him, dragged him 
to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready 
with their clubs, to beate out his braines, Pocahootas 
the Kings dearest daughter, when no entreaty would 
prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne 
opon his to save him from death: whereat the Emperour 
wa« contented he should live. . . . 

' Tber say be bore a pleasant shew. 
Bat sure bis beart was sad.' " 

How he got back to Jamestown, and what he 
did there, may be read with interest, and per- 
haps with profit, in the famous •• Historie of 
Virginia." 

One is tempted to quote from Captain Smith's 
'• True Travels," if one only knew where to 
b^in and where to end. Let anyone read, say, 
his account of the sea-fight between the ship of 
Saint Malo and the -\rgosie of Venice, and he 
will follow Captain Smith to the very end of 
his adventures. In a few vigorous words he 
brings the whole scene before us, — - the chase, 
the fight, the sinking ship : as vi\'id a bit of 
description as will lie found anywhere. 

Turn then to the •' Sea Grammar." Who 
woidd dream of finding entertainment in a 
manual of instruction to mariners ? Listen, 
then, to his accoimt of how to manage a fight 
at sea :

Eaklt Coloxxax DATS ix America.* 



The so-called neglected period of American 
history which extends from the b^;inning of 
active colonization to the last and greatest of 
the inter-colonial wars has received most adniir- 
able treatment in the third volume of Mr. Elroy 
M. Avery's " History of the United States and 
Its People." Political events, including consti- 
tutional and governmental difficidties, economic 
progress, and social development, are all equally 
well attended to. Perhaps a little more might 
have been said of the dress and customs of the 
people, and of their literary aspirations, few 
thou^ they were ; but that criticism aside, the 
reader has little to grumble at, for nowhere else 
in popular form can he find so vast a fund of 
valuable and interesting information accurately 
and entertainingly given. 

The colonial history of the Jerseys is usually 
regarded as prosaic in the extreme ; but Mr. 
Avery has discovered in it points of dramatic 
interest, and has spared no pains to reveal them 
to us. He has discussed the real-estate trans- 
actions that began with the first indenture and 
came to a climax in the quintipartite deed, with 
considerable clearness and vivacity, thus ren- 
dering a great service to college students whose 
perplexity at this stage of their course in 
•• American History " is often most embarrass- 
ing to the instructor. They can now read the drj- 
details in story form, and find them connected 
and comprehensible. Mr. Avery has reached 
the same happy result, in point of clearness, in 
the case of the Carolinas ; only there he has 
entered at large into the constitutional and

ethnological characteristics of the people, and 
has drawn some very reasonable conclusions 
from his long array of facts. For example, he 
would account for the South Carolinian's advo- 
cacy of the doctrine of State Eights by a refer- 
ence to the training of an earlier generation in 
resistance to laws that were not to be found in 
a written code. In like manner, the emotional 
temperament that has so often moved the 
Palmetto State to hasty action is ascribed, 
under the principles of heredity, to a strain of 
Huguenot blood. To all this we are willing to 
bow assent, provided we can find an equally 
satisfactory explanation for equally hasty ac- 
tions with less provocation in other States. 

Concern for the Indians, which was so marked 
in the first volume of our author's work, is 
continued in this, the third; and in connection 
therewith, we are made familiar with some very 
suggestive particulars respecting early projects 
for a union of the colonies. It is not generally 
known that John Locke the philosopher, and 
William Penn the philanthropist, were both 
interested in the subject, the one having sub- 
mitted " a plan for a military dictatorship," the 
other " one for a peaceful congress." 

In showing how most of the charters were 
originally framed for mere trading companies, 
and how the policy of the home government 
became, through the necessities of a political 
and economic situation, imperialistic, as well as 
in gathering together material on the atlminis- 
trative machinery of the Old Thirteen, vidth 
variations or exceptions as exhibited in the case 
of corporate colonies pointed out, Mr. Avery has 
done some excellent work. The enumeration 
of officials and of their respective duties is use- 
ful. Oi'dinarily we think little of the surveyor- 
general of the customs, and of the surveyor of 
the woods — the wood-reeve of an earlier system ; 
but here we see that the position of each was 
no sinecure and had important consequences for 
the future. 

The illustrations in the book are very diverse 
in character, and add a great deal to its value 
as a reference work. They consist of title-pages 
of rare pamphlets, specimen pages or facsimiles 
of interesting documents, autographs, photo- 
graphs, coats-of-arms, seals, maps, jjlans, coins, 
and the like. So varied and so numerous are 
they that Mr. Avery must have ransacked all 
the historical libraries of the seaboard States 
for them. It is a pity that he has sometimes 
thought it incumbent upon him to introduce an 
illustration without much apjiarent reason. For 
instance, the vaguest allusion to Magna Charta 



seems to have called, in his opinion, for a repro- 
duction of " a heliotype print of tlie original 
document in the British Museum." As in the 
earlier volumes, slang phrases, awkward sen- 
tences, poor arguments, and attempts at face- 
tiousness, are not infrequent. We seriously 
question whether the dignity of the nai-rative is 
enhanced by such expressions as " his precious 
eight " and " his pious friends," both of which 
refer to the Carolina proprietors who stood in 
close social and political relations to Charles II., 
but who, so far as we know, made no preten- 
sions at piety, and were not hypocrites. 

Most writers content themselves with tracing 
the history of the United States back to the 
thirteen English colonies that extended along 
the Atlantic coast ; but Mr. Avery lias most 
commendably taken a broader view of his coun- 
try's beginnings, and has introduced chapters 
on Florida and Louisiana. This we note with 
genuine pleasui-e ; for, although these chapters 
do not contain a gi-eat deal of matter, nor any- 
thing really new, yet their introduction is 
decidedly a step in the right direction. For the 
same reason that we welcome them, however, we 
dislike to see a companion chapter on Canada. 
Details concerning Canada have logically no 
place, except by way of comparison or contrast, 
in " A History of the United States and Its 
People." Should the union between the two 
countries ever occur, — as newspapers of the 
more southern region anticipate with confidence, 
and the very idea of which the people of the 
more northern one reject with scorn, — it will 
then be time enough to give the same attention 
to the St. Lawi-ence valley as can now be given 
with the highest propriety to the Mississippi.

sonnets. This has for a caption •' Great Souls Live 
Long": 

'' ° So little done,' brave heart, ' so much to do ' ! 

Since first the sun and stars looked down to scan 

The core of Nature's phantom-pageant, Man, 
This was the cry of workers such as you ; 
Each strove and strove till, sndden. bright in view, 

The rich fruition of the striver's plan 

Shone far away beyond Life's narrowing span, — 
Shone while the world was wanng him adieu. 
Great souls live many an eon in Man's brief years. — 

To him who dreads no spite of Fate or Chance, 
Yet loves this Earth, and Man, and starry spheres, 

Life's swiftness is the pulse of Life's romance ; 

And when the footsteps fall of Death's advance 
He hears the feet : he quails not. but he hears." 

The title given the closing sonnet of this sequence 
is "The Captains of the Past." 

•■ Brother of those who, ere our England threw 

Her arms around the world, steered ont to roam 
'Neath sails of Wonder, o'er the trackless foam, 

I think I see them standing there with yon 

At azure gates within yon sky so blue. 

So pure, it seems like Heaven's own sapphire dome — 
Standing and gazing on your wondrous home 

AVhere sleeps a hero's dust — the wild ' World's View.' 

I hear them saying. — those Captains of the Past, — 
All of Old England's hero-pedigree. 
From him who drove the Spaniard from the sea 

To him who nailed his colours to the mast 
' Pray God ye be not burying there the last 

Of England's sons who keep her strong and free ! ' " 

These poems, with their generous hero-worship, and 
their embodiment of the author's belief in England's 
'■ unique destiny as the great inspiring moral force of 
the world," are fully worthy of the hand that wrote 
"The Coming of Love" and "•Christmas at the 
Mermaid." They are extended into a book of forty 
pages by means of an introduction and a few ex- 
planatory notes. 

From Mr. Edwaitl Sydney Tylee's "Trumpet 
and Flag " we may make no more appropriate ex- 
tract than a couple of stanzas from another tribute 
to Cecil Rhodes. 

" Elsewhere, the impartial wings of time 

Sad-vestured autumn bring. 
Only in Orford's happy clime 

Reigns an unfading spring. 
Youth with its own immortal gifts. 

High hopes and splendid dreams, 
Makes glad her reverend streets, and drifts 

On her enchanted streams. 

" There, when hU manhood ripened first. 

The great Adventurer, 
Last of our Empire-builders, nursed 

His filial love for her. 
Thither, when on his heart he knew 

Death's chilly finger laid. 
As close the eternal curtains drew, 

His dying fancies strayed." 

The principal contents of Mr. Tylee's volume are 
devoted to poems on public men, and pieces in- 
spired by incidents of the South African War. The 
verse is smooth and pleasing, although its themes 
are often grim. 

South Africa and the men who made it supply 
Mr. Lance Fallaw with themes for a good half of 



the poems called " Silverleaf and Oak." They are 
poems of enterprise and adventure beneath the 
Southern Cross. 

" Guard, Britons, guard as symbol 
The crucifix of flame, — 
The shape that bids yon tremble 

At thought of hero-shame : 
The hue that's clear and golden 
As heaven's own minted ore. 
Type of the faith 
Thro' scar and scathe 
Of some who 've passed before. 
The spirit of ages olden 
Has shown you sign anew ; 
Take for your test 
That crow^ning crest, 
As martyrs' seed should do. 
Let the high Cross remind you 

Of whence your record runs — 
Your fathers' North behind you. 
And southward fare the sons '. " 

The feeling of Wanderlust receives fine expres- 
sion in the poem entitled " The Spirit of Hidden 
Place.s," of which these are the opening stanzas : 

" Over the mountain's shoulder, round the unweathered cape. 
In lands beyond the skyline, there hides a nameless shape, — 
Whether of fiend or goddess no mortal well may know ; 
But when she speaks — with flushing cheeks, they one by 
one must go, 

" To men in far old cities, scanniug the curious chart. 
Her voice would sound at midnight, like music in the heart ; 
Across the wrinkled parchment a glory seemed to fall. 
And pageants pass like shapes in glass along the pictured 
wall, 

** She led the sails of Lisbon beyond the Afric shore. 
Winning a world of wonders by seas unknown before. 
She watched the sturdy captains of Holland's India fleet 
Planting their post on that grim coast where the two oceans 
meet." 

Mr. Fallaw's " English " poems include lyrics in 
imitation of Shelley on " The Eagle " and " The 
Rainbow," followed appropriately by "The Sea- 
Nymph's Lament for Shelley," a finely imaginative 
composition in which the poet is made welcome to 
the realms that lie in the depths of the sea. 

*' Yes, thou shalt sing — far sweeter than on earth 
Thy lay shall rise, though then 't was half divine. 
The magic that in worlds unseen hath birth 
Transcends the mortal power that once was thine." 

Canon Atkinson's '• Mattathias. and Other Poems " 
is a volume of occasional, geographical, and relig- 
ious verse, modest in its aim, the product of a cul- 
tivated and reflective mind. '* Mattathias," and the 
group of pieces inspired by the Zulu compaign of 
1879, are poems which strongly suggest the spirited 
manner of Macaulay. A number of other pieces 
seem mainly Wordsworthian in their inspu-ation, 
and the Lake Country provides their setting. 
Derbyshire and Cornwall are other regions cele- 
brated by the poet. These lines descriptive of a 
sunset on the Cornish coast are exceptionaUy pleas- 
ing, and may be taken as an example of Canon 
Atkinson's best work: 

'■ The tender hues of evening f»de 
And every eastward-facing cliff 
Writes, as in mighty hieroglyph. 
Along the sand its lengthening shade.

[Sept. 16, 



" The busy sounds of day have died ; 
'T is silence all on land and sea, 
Save in the wind's soft melody 
That freshens with the rising tide. 

" And, on the hills fast darkening-. 

Against the sun's half .drownfed disk 
Their feathery fringe of tamarisk 
Grows dusky as ApoUyon's wing. 

" Now vanished is the last red flush 
That lingered in the western sky ; 
Both wind and wave still gentlier sigh, 
And join the universal hush. 

" The day is gone ; and on the uight 

The myriad lamps of heaven emerge. 
And on the coast's extremest verge 
The triple flash of Trevose Light." 

The poems on " Sacred Subjects " which fill nearly 
half of the volume are reprinted, in part, from a 
collection published nearly thirty years ago. 

The quiet charm of Mr. Gascoigne Mackie's 
" Short Poems " is well illustrated by the lines 
called " Home from France." 

" Back to old England again. 
To the land of fog and rain, 

Beautiful France, adieu. 
I shall think of the little gay pinks 
That grow on the windy links : 
Of the peasant with his goad 
Leading his lumbering loa<l : 
Of the fishing boats racing home 
Far over the western foam ; 

land of the lily and vine 

You are fair, but you are not mine : 

Beautiful France, adieu. 
When the dove flies south to Spain 
Like love that turns home again. 
And through fields of yellowing maize 
In the still October days 
The gurgling brook runs by : 
And the troubled swallows cry 
Roimd the tiles of the old Basque tower 
As they gather, hour by hour, 
And the steadfast evening star 
Shines down on the hills of Sare, 

1 shall wish that I too had wings ; 
And remembering happy things, 

I shall remember you ! " 

A slender sheaf of "Lyrics," by Mr. Gerald 
Grould, which has lain too long unnoticed on our 
desk, yields a measure of golden grain far exceeding 
expectation. Mr. Goidd sings of "the things that 
truly are " with a depth of feeling and a beauty of 
expression that clearly place him among the poets. 

" And sorrow and sin are not at all 

Matched with the things that truly are 

— As though one set against a star 
The flung spray of the waterfall." 

Mr. Gould is a lyrist of acceptance, of the joy of 
earth, and the fulness of life. His prevailing mood 
is portrayed in the following exquisite lyric : 

" Give me one hour — the years are young. 
There is all life to throw away. 
And all life's songs are to be sung 

— Sing me one song to-day, to-day. 

" Here wi4> the green trees and blue sky 
And winds about the woodland driven 
— Can we let such a moment by 
As this, and hope to be forgiven ? 



" O laughing eyes and serious brow, 

And mouth almost too sweet to kiss. 
Never was such a time as now. 
Such opportunity as this ! 

'• Give me your hands — I '11 hold them long ; 
Give me your lips — I 11 hold them fast ; 
Oh ! there '11 be time enough for song 
Between the first kiss and the last ! " 

Life is well worth having to all except the souls 
who brood over its ills. 

" Better a wide and windy world, and scope 
For rise and downfall of a mighty hope. 

Than many little ills ; 
Better the sudden horror, the swift wrong. 
Than doubts and cares that die not, and tlie long 

Monotony that kills ; 
The empty dawns, pale stars and narrow skies 
— Mean hopes, mean fears, mean sorrows, and mean sighs." 

There is a Meredithian zest in this strain that puts 
to shame the haunters of graveyards, and Mr. 
Meredith would surely applaud the stanzas on "The 
Earth-ChUd." 

" Out of the red-brown earth, out of the grey-brown streams, 
Came this perilous body, cage of perilous dreams ; 
To the ends of all waters and lands they are tossed, they are 

whirled ; 
For my dreams are one with my body — yea, one with the 

world." 

We shall hope to hear more of Mr. Gerald Gould ; if 
he is a young man, it is fairly safe to say that he has 
a future. William Morton Payne.

sculpture ; and now one of his avowed followers, Mrs. 
Arthur Strong, sounds a call that is even more con- 
fident and aggressive in her book entitled " Roman 
Sculpture" (Scribner). We are still allowed to find 
Greek art more attractive than Roman ; but we must 
no longer slight the latter or feel dulness or depres- 
sion in its presence. " What is now claimed for 
Roman art is an aesthetic advance — a power, that 
is, of conveying to the spectator effects which the 
Greeks had not yet attempted or realized." Natur- 
ally, all of us had recognized the achievements of 
Roman portraiture, and some had felt, with Vernon 
Lee, its occasional attainment of Renaissance charm. 
We realized, too, that Roman political supremacy 
had not only prolonged the life of Hellenism, but in 
a sense had also offered new subjects to Hellenistic 
art. We were equally well aware that by the time 
of Constantine plastic art had involved the vehicle, 
effective if a bit ungainly, that so long conveyed 
Christian doctrine and legend. We were likewise 
familiar with the all-powerful influence exerted by 
the monuments at Rome upon the spirits of the 
Renaissance : the testimony of Bernini and the exam- 
ples of Michelangelo and Raphael hardly need recall- 
ing. Upon all this, the members of the new school 
dwell with desirable emphasis ; nor can we value too

highly their insistence upon historical continuity. 
But they add thereto the doctrine that Roman sculp- 
ture, working forward from its Hellenic heritage and 
not seldom with Hellenic hands, achieved a signifi- 
cant technical advance. They maintain that it 
'•approached and practically solved the tridimen- 
sional problem," thus creating the " illusionist " style ; 
that it developed the "continuous" style, as seen, 
for instance, on Trajan's colmun : and that '• even in 
the decadent art of the third and fourth century it 
evolved new and important optic tendencies." Collee- 
tively and in detail, the subject* offer an excellent 
battlefield, and the smoke will long hang thick be- 
tween the camps of the contending specialists. Mrs. 
Strong ( Eugenie Sellers ) is an enthusiastic member 
of the new school, and at times is so thorough-going 
in her advocacy that, rememl>ering her sex, one in- 
voluntarily recalls from the classical field another 
striking example of a clever woman's devotion to 
German leadership. Inasmuch as her ability and 
attainments are so well known that unfavorable criti- 
cism cannot be regarded as unfriendly, we must 
record the xmhesitating opinion that she could have 
written a much better book. Numerous infelicities 
may be due to the original employment of the matter 
for the lecture platform : but actual lapses from good 
usage can hardly be covered by the same charitable 
cloak. Surely, when the subject treated lies in the 
field of art we are entitled to an attractive and 
finished presentation : and it is an old dictum that 
the wise advocate should add the allurements of style 
to the compulsion of argument. Nevertheless, the 
work is so fresh, so suggestive, and so replete with 
the results of the latest research, that it will be a wel- 
come addition to the student's library. The volume 
is corpulent, well Ulustrated, and " workable ": but 
there are too many misprints, even for a volume of 
four hundred pages bristling with technical terms 
and unfamiliar names.

such a person. Son and grandson of Methodist

Liddon. this ministerial book-lover can also gossip 
about Pepys and Mrs. Pioz.zi and Charles Lamb, and 
is even caught quoting, with admirable effect, from 
Eugene Field's " Bibliomaniac's Prayer." In short, 
this is the most brightly entertaining book about

j the title, " Ralph Heathoote : Letters of a Young 
; Diplomatist and Soldier during the Time of Napo- 
leon" (John Lane Co.). The writer of the letters 
appears to have been a thoroughly amiable young 
man, and warmly attached to his mother, to whom 
the correspondence is addressed. English on his 
father's side, but born in Bonn and passing much 
of his early life at Cassel, he studied at Gottingen, 
then visited England, was appointed Secretary to 
the British Legation at Cassel, and returned thence 
to England, when his chief. Brook Taylor, incurred 
the ill-will of the all-powerful Napoleon and was 
forced to retire. " The Brook Taylor Incident '" is 
made much of by the compiler of the volume. The 
more stirring and eventful part of Heathcote's life 
began with his exchange of diplomacy for the army. 
He entered the English service as cornet in the 
Royal Dragoons, but soon rose to a position on the 
staff of Lord Cathcart : saw something of actual 
warfare when as militarj- secretary he accompanied 
his commander to Sweden and Denmark : and 
served as staff officer in the Peninsula from 1809 
to 1813. The last letter is dated Nov. 23, 1814. 
As a testimonial of filial affection, and as a record 
of the every-day life of a somewhat gifted young 
man in several lands and in various capacities, one 
hundred years ago. the correspondence has interest ; 
but its literary value is as slight as its historical im- 
portance. The fear of having his letters intercepted

To divide the field of literature 
The ballad as <. j vertical instead of horizontal 

« literarv Wp' ■ ,. ,°. 

lines IS the purpose of a new series, 
entitled "The Types of Literature" (Houghton), 
edited by Professor William Allan Neilson. The 
intention is to " devote each volume to the considera- 
tion of the characteristics of a single formal type, 
to describe its origins and the foreign influences that 
have affected it, and to estimate the litei-aiy value 
and historical importance of all the chief specimens 
tliat have been produced in England and America." 
No better beginning could have been made than 
with " The Popular Ballad " by Professor Gummere, 
whose work on this subject lias made him the legiti- 
mate successor of Professor Child. In this book we 
have a statement of much that is already known to 
us from Professor Gummere's other works. What 
is of especial interest here is the development of the 
relation which the ballad structure bears to the 
original choral throng. Incremental repetition, the 
advancing of the story by stages marked by repeated 
words or lines, is regarded as final proof of popular 
origin, and survives in three forms, as an effective 
expression of the situation, as a perfunctory mark 
of style, and as ballad commonplace. " It is," as 
Professor Gummere says, " the genius of the ballad 
itself, formally expressed, springing from quite 
intelligible conditions of a singing, dancing, di'a- 
inatic festal throng ; hence the unique and ancient 
appeal of this stretched metre at its best." The 
ballads are aptly classified into six groups, — the 
oldest ballads, ballads of kinship, the coronach and 
ballads of the supernatural, legendary, Border and 
greenwood ballads, so that a comprehensive survey 
of the whole field is obtained. In the treatment of 
sources Professor Gummere holds that the epic 
material, except where local, may generally be 
regarded as borrowed, the dramatic material or 
" action " of the choral throng as original. The last 
chapter, on the worth of the ballads as poetry, is 
written cwi amove, but with that admirable scholarly 
restraint that marks all of Professor Gumm ere's work. 

In " Lonewood Corner : A Country- 
Som.' rural ,^ Horizons" (Button), by Mr. 

John Halshain , author of " Idlehurst, 
we have another of those genially meditative, frankly 
first-personal collection of random observations and 
reflections that Mr. A. C. Benson has of late done 
so much to make us agreeably familiar with, and 
that almost anyone with the literary instinct and 
nothing in particular (but a good deal in general) 
to say can produce in a more or less acceptable form. 
Probably it is the most natural shape to be assumed 
by the one book that everybody is supposed to have 
it in him to write ; and as the aim of this kind of 
writing is not of the loftiest, so the chances of igno- 
minious failure are fewer than in more pretentious 



contributions to literatm'e. Mr. Halsham, moreover, 
is fortified against adverse criticism : the book is but 
a ijarergon; his main business is with his onions, his 
Beurr^ pears, his pansies and long-tailed columbines. 
He wisely holds that "all authors would be the betr 
ter for an independence earned among saladings and 
worts." His chapters touch on persons of his neigh- 
liorhood and matters of parish interest or of wider 
public concern. Looking back some years, he la- 
ments that " the frenzy of haste and the destruction 
of natural beauty continue at much the old rate ; but 
I think with even less protest raised than before: 
we are so far poorer as a people that we cannot even 
think of affording ourselves an hour of clear leisure, 
or a piece of unspoiled country larger than a deer- 
park." Toward the end of his volume he sings the 
praises of old books, and says of his own library : 
"Therefore my book-case contains as a basis, in all 
sorts of editions, from the safe comment of Gronovius 
to the jaunty gi-aces of Gildersleeve, the Greeks and 
Latins, pretty complete. I read through them at a 
steady plod, and when I reach the gate of horn in 
my several journeys, I presently turn about and 
begin again : and on the whole I get more pleasure 
from the dead languages — spite of the drag of an 
inveterate hobble in construing — than from any 
other sort of reading." There is much good browsing 
in the unpretentious pages of this modestly learned 
and pleasantly chatty writer.

'nUlnl^n,, entitled " Hampton and Reconstruc- 

ill the South. tion " (The State Company, Colum- 
bia, S. C.) is, as the title indicates, mainly an account 
of the nomination and election in 1876 of General 
Wade Hampton as governor of South Carolina on 
the " straightout " Democratic platform. Introduc- 
tory chapters give an account of Hampton's ancestry, 
his early life and training, an appreciation of his 
character, and a sketch of his service as a Confed- 
erate general in the Civil War. In the last chap- 
ter the author speaks briefly of the later years of 
Hampton as United States Senator and as retired 
citizen. The author, it would seem, is of Northern 
birth, was a Confederate soldier under Hampton, 
and after the war lived in South Carolina. The 
best of the book is that relating to the latter part 
of the Reconstruction period and the restoration of 
constitutional government by President Hayes. In 
these chapters the writer draws upon his own recol- 
lections as an eye-witness and frequent participant 
in the affairs described. The work is interestingly 
\vritten, with perhaps too much moralizing, and con- 
tains an abundant store of good anecdotes. The 
account of the old age and death of Hampton is 
pathetic ; poverty bore hard upon him, and polit- 
ically he was submerged by the rising tide of 
" democracy " as it is now called. Hampton repre- 
sents the old, Tillman stands for the new. It is a 
pity that a fuller account is not given of Hampton's 
antebellum life ; but as it is, the book is welcome as 
the only life of the great South Carolinian.

A leaf from Miss Clara Barton's tantalizing scrap 

a'JZ'oifui of autobiography entitled -The 
woman. Storj' of my Childhood " ( Baker & 

Taylor Co. ), is as wonderful as its writer : it is 
extremely interesting, and yet it hardly touches on 
those aptitudes and activities that all the world 
associates with her remarkable personality. She 
tells us how morbidly sensitive and shy she was as 
a child ; how her brother taught her to ride bare- 
back ; how she learned house-painting, including the 
grinding and mixing of her colors, and satinet- 
weaving in one of the earliest New England satinet 
mills ; how she learned to play with boys, and to 
throw a ball as well as any of them ; and how she 
took up school-teaching with fear and trembling, 
and was astonished and puzzled when at the close 
of the term her school was ranked first for excel- 
lence of discipline. To discipline she had not given 
a thought, and hardly knew what the word meant 
In describing her two years of nursing experience 
at the bedside of a disabled brother, she does touch 
on the main concern of her later life ; but one could 
read the book without a suspicion of its author's 
real claim to world-renown. That this woman, 
almost a nonagenarian now, who has done so much 
hard work and dangerous work, was. as a girl, of 
the frailest physique and the most nervous tempera- 
ment, is likely to surprise most readers. As in 
the case of many men and women of the noblest 
achievement, what she has accomplished seems to 
have been effected in spite of the body rather than 
with its help. 



XOTES. 



Two plays by Jean Rotrou, " Saint Genest " and 
" Venceslas," with an elaborate introduction and notes 
by Professor Thonias F. Crane, form a volume for use 
as a college text now published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

The publishers of Miss Clara Barton's interesting 
little volume called "The Story of My Childhood," re- 
viewed in this issue of The Dial, announce that Miss 
Barton has in preparation other volumes bearing on her 
subsequent life. 

Mr. E. V. Lucas's latest book, " The Gentlest Art," 
will be published in this coimtry by the Macmillan Co. 
The art alluded to in the title is that of letter writing, 
and the volume is an anthology of the most entertaining 
letters in the language. 

The " Globe Edition " of the English poets, probably 
the best known and most widely used of all such edi- 
tions, is to appear this fall in a new series to be desig- 
nated as " The New Globe Poets." At the same time 
the works of Bj-ron are to be added to the series, with 
an introductory biographical sketch by the late Sir Leslie 
Stephen. 

" The Prairie Classics " is the title of a new series of 
standard reprints which Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 
will inaugurate this fall with four volumes containing 
Scott's " KenUworth " and " Ivanhoe " and Dickens's 
« Tale of Two Cities " and " OUver Twist." The vol- 
umes will be carefully printed at the University Press, 
and each is to contain a frontispiece in color. 



Five pocketable volumes of Thoreau are sent us by 
the Messrs Crowell. Each has a frontispiece and a 
special introduction. The " Excursions " is headed by 
Emerson's biographical sketch, while " Walden " is in- 
troduced by Professor Roberts, " A Week on the Con- 
cord and Merrimac Rivers " by Mr. N. H. Dole, and 
" Cape Cod " and " The Maine Woods " by Mrs. Annie 
Russell Marble. 

We learn that Mr. Frederic Harrison's " The Creed 
of a Lavman," which was published last spring, was the 
first of a series of four volumes which will contain a com- 
plete collection of his miscellaneous essays. The second 
volimie, containing Philosophical Essays and Discus- 
sions, will appear in the early fall, and succeeding 
volumes wUl deal with Social and Economic questions, 
and Controversial Essays and Criticisms. 

A new series of small volumes, each containing a 
single short story, has been started by Messrs. Thomas 
Y. Crowell & Co. The group of six volumes now issued 
gives us the following: " Good-Xight," by Miss XUeanor 
Gates; " Allee Same," by Miss Frances Aymar Mat- 
thews; "Dawn," by Miss Katharine Holland Brown; 
" Schmidt," by Mr. Lloyd Osboume; " In the Deep of 
the Snow," by Mr. Charles G. D. Roberts; and " Ara- 
miuta and the Automobile," by Mr. Charles Battell 
Loomis. These booklets are prettily illustrated. 

The following additions to the " World's Classics " 
are annoimced by Mr. Henry Frowde for immediate 
publication: Butler s " Analogy," edited by Mr. Glad- 
stone; Cervantes's "Don Quixote " (Jervas's translation 
in two volumes), edited by Mr. J. Fitzmaurice Kelly; 
Smollett's " Travels through France and Italy," with 
introduction by Mr. T. Seccombe ; Fielding's " Journal 
of a Voyage to Lisbon," with introduction and notes by 
Mr. Austin Dobson; and the first volume of the copy- 
right reprints of Ruskin (Ruskin House editions, by 
special arrangement with Mr. (ieorge Allen), consisting 
of " Sesame and Lilies " and " The Ethics of the Dust." 

Three important volumes of historical and descriptive 
character contained in Messrs. McClurg & Co.'s fall 
list are the following : " A Handbook of the Philip- 
pines," by Mr. Hamilton M. Wright, a manual of the 
productions, resources, and commercial aspect of tha 
islands; "The Great Plams, 1527-1870," by Mr. Ran- 
dall Parrish, which may he called a topical history of 
the great movements that opened and settled the vast 
area between the Missouri and the Rockies ; and " The 
Campaign of Santiago de Cuba," a strategic history of 
one of the most interesting lessons in modem warfare, 
by Col. H. H. Sargent, U. S. A., who is a recognized 
authority on the conduct of military operations. 

In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the early home of 
the late Thomas Bailey Aldrich, a movement has taken 
rise to establish an appropriate and permanent memo- 
rial. A committee of citizens, headed by the mayor of 
the city, has led in the formation of The Thomas Bailey 
Aldrich Memorial Association, which proposes to acquire 
by purchase the old house in Portsmouth which belonged 
to ilr. Aldrich's grandfather, Thomas Darling Bailey, 
the house in which Mr. Aldrich spent his boyhood, and 
to preserve it in perpetuity as a memorial museum. Mrs. 
Aldrich and Mr. Talbot Aldrich, the poet's surviving 
son, have agreed to deposit there his priceless collection 
of first editions and valuable manuscripts and auto- 
graphs, together with many other literaiy relics of the 
first interest, and have undertaken to restore the interior 
of the house as nearly as possible to its old-time appear-

ance. It is hoped to raise by popular subscription the sum 
of $10,000, which will suffice for the pui-chase of the 
house and will provide a sufficient endowment to insure 
its proper maintenance. Contributions may be sent to the 
Treasurer of The Thomas Bailey Aldrich Memorial 
Association, care of Houghton, Mifflin & Company, 4 
Park Street, Boston. 

An important publishing enterprise just announced 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. is that of a library 
of selected literature for children, to be entitled " The 
Children's Hour." Its aim is to bring within the rea- 
sonable compass of ten volumes of convenient size the 
best stories for children which can be gathered together. 
The work of selection has been done under the direction 
of Miss Eva March Tappan, well known as a writer of 
stories for children and as an author possessing excep- 
tional ability for a work of this kind. Her selections 
have been made with the cooperation of other experts 
under the direction of the publishers. The aim has been 
to construct a set of books for children in which the 
parents may have a feeling of confidence tliat the liter- 
ature here provided is that which every child really 
ought to have. 

Superstition, says Mr. Fletcher Bascom Dressier, is 
"that form of emotional credulity prompted by an emo- 
tional predisposition which had its origin in adjustments 
to physical conditions long since passed away." This 
definition is taken from a monogi-aph on "Superstition 
and Education" published at the University Press, 
Berkeley, California. Mr. Dressier has been collecting 
superstitions from his students to the number of nearly 
nine hundred, mostly women, in two California Normal 
schools. With each superstition furnished, the student 
expressed either disbelief, partial beUef, or full belief. 
The results are presented statistically in classified form. 
What most impresses us is the astonishing number and 
variety of the superstitions recorded, many of them hav- 
ing been contributed by a single student each. The show- 
ings of belief and misbelief are rather melancholy, coming 
as they do from young people of the average age of nine- 
teen, engaged in preparation for educational work. 

A publishing aimounceraent of unusual interest is 
made by Messrs. Duffield & Company, New York and 
Chatto & Windus, of London. These two houses have 
arranged for the publication of a series of books to be 
called the " Shakespeare Library," in which will be 
included various volumes indispensable to a thorough 
understanding of the poet, but never before issued at 
reasonable prices. The Library will be divided into 
four parts. Part fii'st will include " The Old Spelling 
Shakespeare," published in forty volumes and in the 
orthogi'aphy of the poet's own time, the text under the 
editorship of Dr. Fumivall; Part second. The Shake- 
speare Classics, under the general editorship of Professor 
I. Gollancz, editor of The Temple Shakespeare, will 
include the various romances, histories, plays, and poems 
used by Shakespeare as the originals or direct sources 
of his plays; Part three, called Shakespeare's England, 
will include volumes illustrative of the Ufe, thought, 
and literature of England in the time of Shakespeare. 
A fourth part, to be called the Lamb Shakespeare for 
Yoimg People, will be based on Charles and Mary 
Lamb's tales, in which an attempt will be made to msert 
skilfully within the setting of prose those scenes and 
passages from the plays with which the young reader 
should early become acquainted. The work will be done 
imder the special supervision of Professor Gollancz, the 
editor of the Library. 



AXXOTJNCEMENT LIST OF FALL BOOKS. 



The classified list given below as the prospective output 
for the coming fall and winter season contains nearly itOO 
titles, representing about fifty American publishing houses. 
These announcement lists, carefully prepared from the ear- 
liest and most authentic sources especially for our pages, 
have for many years been a special feature of The Dial ; 
and their usefulness and interest, both to the book trade and 
the book public, have long been recognized. They not only 
show at a glance what books are coming out in any depart- 
ment of literature, but make a complete showing of the 
principal publishing activities of the year. All the books 
entered are new books — new editions not being included 
unless having new form or matter; and while no attempt 
has been made to include titles as titles merely, regardless 
of their significance or interest to our readers, yet it is be- 
lieved that no really important book is missing from the list. 
Some of the more interesting featiu'es among these announce- 
ments are commented upon in the leading editorial in this 
issue of The Dial.

SEASON 1907-8 

On accouut of the unusually large accuniulatiou of consignments during the past Summer we were obliged 
to begin our Fall Sales on September 23. During the previous week we published in the daily papei-s aimounce- 
ments of thiity sales, chiefly of Private Libraries and Collections from the consignments then on hand. 

The offer of so many interesting and impoi-tant Collections at the commencement of the Season is 
probably without precedent in the history of Book Auctions in America, and insures a year of unusual 
interest to buyers and collectors. 

This Company (with its predecessor, Bangs & Co.) lias had an iininterrupted business career of 
seventy-five years duration, and has conducted to successful issues the bulk of all the important sales of lit- 
erary property held in America during that period. It refers with confidence to its lai'ge clientele of con- 
signors and its unequaled list of buyers throughout the country. It begins the present season with a better 
organization and larger facihties than ever before, and its business will be conducted with absolute fidelity 
to the intei-ests of both buyer and consignor. 

Full details of the sales already announced, and catalogues when issued, will be sent upon request. 
Executors and Administrators of Estates havmg Libraries to sell. Librarians, P\iblishers and Booksellers 
are invited to correspond with us. Write for terms and other information.

A READABLE WEEKLY 

" PUBLIC OPINION " was very much prized by Thomas Carlyle, and was one 
of the last journals he read, said Dr. W. R. Nicoll in "The British Weekly" 

PUBLIC OPINION 



Edited by PERCY L. PARKER 



TWOPENCE WEEKLY 



"PUBLIC OPINION" is eminently a readable paper. There is no padding in it. It is a paper 
which exists to put on record the ideas which men are thinking, and especially the ideas which make for 
ReligioiLs, Intellectual, Political, and Social Progress as these are recorded in the world's books, papers, 
and magazines. 

It is a paper specially suited for those who exert public influence — for " PUBLIC OPINION " 
does not reflect one side of life only — it seeks to cover all sides of thought and opinion. 

It is the bare truth to say tliat there is no other paper published in Great Britain which every week 
contains such stimulus to thought, or such a vast amount of real information presented lucidly and in a 
readable type. 

" PUBLIC OPINION " is published every Friday, and its price is Twopence. It has been in 
existence 47 years. 

" PUBLIC OPINION " can be obtained from any news agent or bookstall, or will be sent post 
free for one year to any address in the United Kingdom for 10s. lOd., and to any place abroad for 
13s. per annum. Orders should be addi'essed to: —

THE INDIANS' BOOK 

By NATALIE CURTIS. 
The book presents in rich and elaborate form an invaluable record of the North Ameriean Indians. The 
Indians themselves were persuaded that such a book would perpetuate the dignity of their race, and told 
their j)oetic legends, and sang their strange songs, permitting their visitor to record these things exactly. 
Hence this is a revelation of the Indian — his customs, mind, character, and very soul. 

With an introductory note by President Roosevelt With eight full pages 

in color, twenty full pages in sepia, and many drawings, made &om original 

Indian designs: and with many pages of Indian music^ pbotograi^is, ete.

A TEST OF CHARACTER. 



A maxim by Goethe, recently brought to 
light, reads a.s follows : "A man shows his ti-ue 
character only when he speaks of a great man 
or of a great thing. Tl^t is the true touch- 
stone of his soul.'* Speaking of touchstones, 
we are reminded of Matthew Arnold's insistence 
upon the usefulness of pro\'iding one's .self 
with an apparatus of brief poetical passages, 
supremely excellent in form, to be used as tests 
of poetry in general. No matter how deceptive 
the spurious metal may be. when viewed by 
itself, its character is plainly revealed when it 
is brought into comparison with the pure gold 
of a phrase from Dante or Milton or Shake- 
speare. Groethes maxim woxdd seem to extend 
still further the usefulness of such touchstone 
phrases. Applj- them, not to poetrj- for the 
purpose of technical criticism, but to men, as 
tests of their capacity for generous appreciation 
and lofty imaginings. It is not the least among 
the uses of noble literature that it may thus 
serve to distinguish the aristocracy of intellec- 
tual endowment from the common herd of those 
whose thought Is untinged by idealism, and 
whose mental horizon is closely circumscribed 
by the narrow things of the household and the 
market-place. Particularly in a society based 
upon a high average of material comfort, in 
which all sorts of men wear the same kinds of 
clothes, read the same newspapers, and do the 
same things, some test of a searching nature is 
needed to enable us to discern those funtlamental 
differences lietween man and man which must 
still exist, however disguisetl by conventional 
habit and wonted course of life. 

We were reading not long ago what seemed 
to be an intelligent article upon the conditions 
of successful authorship. AVe followed the 
writer's argument with respect until an unfor- 
tunate illustration revealed his true character. 
He referred to the traditional ten jwunds re- 
ceived by 2kIilton for •• Paradise Lost," and 
remarked that it was probably more than that 
" flatulent epic " was worth. This amaring 
revelation of intellectual indigence made it clear 
that the wTiter was not likely to have anything 
worth saying upon any subject related to litera- 
ture. The entire influence of what hatl gone 
before wa.s instantly destroyed. To the same 



194 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



effect we may offer another example that lias 
lingered in the memory for several years. The 
case is that of a yoimg man who wrote poetry, 
and was by way of achieving a certain modest 
success in his pursuit of the art. He liad 
seemed to give evidence both of poetical sensi- 
bility and of expressive faculty. But one un- 
lucky day he expressed himself (in newspaper 
prose) upon the subject of one of the gi-eatest 
of poets, and this is what he said : " As for his 
being a great poet, I don't see it. A lot of 
stuffy old professors and semi-hysterical school- 
marms pretend to find a lot in Dante's stuff, 
but they are suffering from intellectual dry-rot." 
The pitiable vulgarity of disposition evidenced 
by this screed put an end to any hopes we had 
entertained concerning that particular writer of 
verse. It set him definitely outside the pale 
of the Muses' Kingdom. In the light of such 
an illustration of meanness of soul we realize 
the stern significance of Goethe's maxim. It 
becomes more than a sentence in the ordinary 
meaning of the word, it becomes a sentence of 
judgment, fixed and unappealable. 

The foregoing examples of character tested 
and foimd wanting are of inconspicuous proven- 
ance^ but others are not lacking which involve 
well-known names. Without drawing upon the 
countless instances in which gi-eat spirits of the 
same age have failed to do each other justice, 
we may find a sufficiency of striking manifesta- 
tions of defective sympathy among the jtidg- 
ments pronoimced by famous men of letters 
upon their more famous predecessors. The 
blindness which marked Voltaire's estimate of 
Dante and Shakespeare, and Johnson's estimate 
of Milton, and Arnold's estimate of Shelley, 
went beyond the limits of what may be condoned 
as personal idiosyncrasy ; they were something 
more than a legitimate difference in the stand- 
ards of taste ; they provided a revelation of 
character that seriously impairs our respect for 
the men who were capable, with all deliberation, 
of such perverse utterances. And the warmest 
admirers of the great Russian moralist of our 
own time must admit that their idol is partly 
composed of clay when they read the labored 
argument in which he imagines he has disproved 
the genius of Shakespeare. One feels that so 
fatal a defect in a man's make-up as that argu- 
ment reveals must make his opinions upon any 
subject open to suspicion, must immeasurably 
lessen his influence as a teacher of ethics or 
anything else. 

Another modem instance in illustration of 
Goethe's maxim may be found in the critical 



antics of the intellectual mountebank who seems 
to be taken seriously in some quarters as a 
prophet of advanced thought, and even as a 
trustworthy guide for the conduct of life, and 
who has delivered himself upon the subject of 
Shakespeare to the following effect : " There 
are moments when one asks despairingly why 
our stage should ever have been cursed with this 
' immortal ' pilferer of other men's stories and 
ideas, with his monstrous rhetbrical fustian, his 
unbearable platitudes, his pretentious reduction 
of the subtlest i>roblems of life to commonplaces 
against which a Polytechnic debating club would 
revolt." It woiUd not be ea.sy to match this 
example of a pygmy soul taking pride in its own 
insignificance. It was Emerson, we believe, who 
once said that it always gave him pleasure to 
meet men who realized the superiority of Shake- 
speare over all other wi'iters. What he would 
have felt coidd he have met Mr. Bernard Shaw 
is not difficult to conjecture, and we can hardly 
imagine even Emerson's imjierturbable serenity 
as remaining quite unruffled in the presence of 
so monstrous an exhibition of fatuous ignorance. 
The world's judgment upon such men as Dante 
and Shakspeare and Milton has been, of coiu-se, 
so definitely pronoimcetl that no man may now 
hope to reverse it. If one cannot honestly share 
it, he should take Mr. Frederic Harrison's 
advice, and pray for a cleaner spirit, instead of 
indulging in clamorous dissent from the house- 
tops. He need not assei-t wliat he does not 
believe, for that would be hj'pocrisy, but his 
attitude should be one of becoming humility, of 
regretful admission that the fault must be his, 
and tliat the world is svirely right. There is 
hope for the one who takes this position, and 
the light may dawn upon him when he least 
expects it. He may in time come to Guinevere's 
point of view : 

" It was my duty to have loved the highest: 

It surely was my profit had I known; 

It would have been my pleasure had I seen." 

And if it be not altogether true that 

" We needs must love the highest when we see it," 
it is better to aspire toward tliat condition of 
enlightenment than to entrench the soul in 
purblind self-sufficiency, and snarl at whatever 
exceeds the scope of its vision. 

We have illustrated our maxim-text by 
examjjles taken solely from the field of litera- 
ture. But Goethe meant it to be far wider in 
its application, and the theme might profitably 
be enlarged upon with reference to the other 
arts, and to the stiU broader field of hiunan life. 
The annals of history, no less than the achieve-

ments of art, provide these touchstones of the 
soul, and a man's character may be teste<l no 
less clearly by observing how his mind thiiUs 
to significant deeds than by noting its response 
to the appeal of significant forms of expression. 
Shakespeare nearly anticipated Goethe's thought 
when he wrote that 

" Spirits are not finely touched 
But to fine issues," 

for he also meant that a man's character is 
best revealetl by the way in which it reacts to 
the stimulus of worthy deeds and noble thoughts, 
as these are found in the artistic inheritance of 
the race and in the historical recoixl of its upward 
growth. 



THE SHORT STORY OF TO-DAY. 

A STATISTICAL STUDY. 

In the following article, I shall not attempt to 
l)rove that the modern short story had its inception 
in America, or that it is a distinct type of literature : 
neither shall I ti-ace the history of the short story 
from Boccaccio to Kipling, nor attempt to explain 
its art when practised by such masters as Mdrim^e, 
Poe, Turgenieff, Maupassant. Instead, I shall con- 
tent myself with gi\'ing the results of a systematic 
study of the short stories published in the leading 
American magazines during the closing months of 
1906. In beginning my study, I read carefully all 
the short stories * published last year in the Septem- 
ber, October, November, and December numbers of 
the following magazines : 

American .... 25 stories Lippincott's . . . . 25 stories 

Appleton's ... 24 stories McClure's .... 24 stories 

Atlantic Monthly . 12 stories Metropolitan ... 31 stories 

Century Magazine 21 stories Munsey's 23 stories 

Cosmopolitan . . 22 stories Pearson's 27 stories 

Everybo<ly'8 ... 26 stories Reader 14 stories 

Harper's .... 27 stories Scribner's .... 18 stories 

Three hundred and nineteen stories were read, 
ranging in length from 800 to 15,000 words ; 
twenty-six stories fall below 2500 words ; twenty- 
four exceed 7600 words. Of the authors, 157 are 
men, 76 women. As the men write 213 stories, 
it is obvious that a third of the short fiction pub- 
lished in these magazines is the work of women. 
It may not be amiss, in speaking of the sex of 
the writers, to mention that in sixty-three stories 
women have no part and that there are only four 
purely feminine stories in the lot While it may 
not be impossible to write a short story with no 
masculine character, which shall interest the average 
reader, it is a significant fact that such an one is not 
among the stories under consideration. 

Ninety-eight authors fail to give the location of 
their stories, which are here classified a-s " location 

• I have followed the classification of "' What's in the Maga- 
zines.'" All stories classified under " Fiction." which are com-

stories. 



doubtful." Of this class, however, with perhaps a 
half-dozen exceptions wliich describe some phase of 
the life in the Middle West the atmosphere is 
Eastern. The authoi-s of forty-two stories state 
definitely that their cliaracters are New Yorkers ; 
and it seems more than probable that the people in 
thirty-three of the stories whose location is doubtful 
are residents of the metrojx)lis, while as many more 
of the " doubtful " stories have an atmosphere that 
the reader naturally associates with New York and 
its neighboring towns and villages. Next to New 
York in pouit of number is New England, witli 
nineteen stories ; while the characters in twenty of 
the " doubtful " stories are unquestionably Yankees. 
Fotu' stories ai'e found in and around the coal mines 
of Pennsylvania, and the Dutch of the same state 
are the people in three more. South of Mason and 
Dixon's Line are found nine stories, in three of which 
the negro plays a part The authors of fourteen 
stories describe the life of the inhabitants of the 
mountainous region west of the Mississippi. Eight, 
two or three of them long-drawn wails of loneliness, 
come from the desert haunts of the cactus, the 
tarantula, and tlie horned-toad. Three authoi-s 
locate their stories in Chicago ; two others in neigh- 
boring towns. Kansas contributes two stories, 
Missouri one, the mines of northern Michigan 
another. The Great Lakes give up a love romance. 
The woodsmen and trappers and Indians of the wilds 
of Canada are depicted in nine stories. Alaska and 
Newfoundland each contribute a tragedy. Seven 
stories come from the sea ; ten others have each a 
scene on board ships. 

Eighty-six, or a little more tlian a fourth of all 
the stories, are founded in foreign countries. If 
those from Canada, Alaska, Newfoundland, and the 
sea are added, it is seen at once that a third — 104, 
to be exact — are found outside the boundaries of 
our own country. Granting that a few of them were 
\vi-itten by foreign authors, the result can scarcely 
be regarded as a triumph for those critics who have 
been trying to teach American authors to write 
American stories. 

To England belong twenty-five of the foreign 
stories, eleven of which are in London. France gets 
an even score ; a dozen of these French contes are 
worked out in the Latin Quai-ter or on the boule- 
vards of Paris. The mainland of Spain is the scene 
of fom- stories; tlu-ee are laid in Spanish islands 
in the Mediterranean Sea. Five come from the 
Philippines. Scotland, Turkey, and Africa get 
three each. Italy and fictitious republics in Central 
America have two representatives each. Japan has 
a scene in each of t^vo stories ; likewise the battle- 
fields of Manchuria. Ireland, Holland, Eastern 
Asia, the cattle ranges of Australia, the mountains 
of Mexico, Porto Rico, and the Bermuda Islands, 
liave each a single representative in this collection : 
while the remaining seven stories ai-e scattered over 
real and fictitious countries. 

The fact that practically every story contains 
more than one element of interest would seem, on 



196 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



tii-st thought, to make any attempt at classification 
futile ; however, after a careful study of these 319 
stories, I have been able to classify most of them. 
The love-story, the story of adventure, the humorous 
story, the sociological and the psychological study, 
the industrial, political, and detective stories, the 
character study, the newspaper baseball and foot- 
ball stories, the study in horror, the story of married 
life, Chi'istmas, Indian, and ghost stories, suggest 
themselves without reflection. However, these are 
only a few of the more important types. 

As the love-stories are not only most numerous 
but also most interesting as a study, producing some 
rather curious facts, I shall give the statistics in 
detail. Of course, not all stories in which there is 
a love interest, or which end in marriage, are classi- 
fied as love-stories ; only those in which the predomi- 
nating interest is in winning a heart, or retaining 
a heart already won, are placed under this head. 
There are sixty-seven stories of this type, of which 
twenty-nine have foreign backgrounds. In twenty- 
five stories, the authors leave the impression that 
their leading characters are soon to marry ; seven- 
teen end in marriage ; in fifteen, engagements are 
announced ; the wrong man proposes in one ; in 
another, the end is a little too subtle for me to tell 
whether the man gets the girl or not. It is rather 
interesting to note that ten of the seventeen mar- 
riages take place in foreign countries. If nothing 
else can be said in praise of the American as a 
lover, it must be admitted that, since but seven of the 
forty-nine love romances worked out in the United 
States actually end in marriage, he is an extremely 
cautious fellow. While he does not hesitate to lead 
the girl to believe that he intends to marry her, and 
shows no very great aversion to becoming engaged, 
he is certainly in no undue haste to involve himself 
in hymeneal bonds. 

Eight of the love-stories end tragically. A Spanish 
seilorita, a Pueblo Indian girl, and a French daughter 
of northern Canada murder their lovers. An in- 
sane Frenchman poisons his son's fiancie. After 
sparing the life of his rival, a Japanese lover com- 
mits hari-kari on the battlefield. A French gii-l dies 
of a broken heart soon after her lover has sold, for 
a hundred francs, his right to her love. An P>nglish 
chorus-girl pines away and dies when she realizes 
that her lover's social position will prevent their mar- 
riage. A jilted Spanish youth is not disapjxjinted 
when he elects, as a sure means of death, the life of 
a soldier ; for he is destined te become one of the 
eighty thousand sons whom Spain sacrificed in her 
futile effort to retain her sovereignty over Cuba. 
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these trag- 
edies of love is that in only one does an American 
play a part, and even here he does not strike the 
blow. 

It would seem from these love-stories that neither 
the American man nor woman loves to the point of 
tragedy, — our daily newspapers to the contrary not- 
withstanding. There is another peculiarity about the 
American lovers among these story- people. Although 



the sincerest love is based upon self-sacrifice, the note 
of self-sacrifice is seldom touched by an American — 
again the newspapers to the contrary. Duplicity 
is another (juality made conspicuous by its absence. 
From the foregoing, three important facts are de- 
duced : first, when an author intends that hLs hero 
and heroine shall actually marry he either selects for- 
eign characters or drags Americans into some foreign 
country ; second, when he has a tragic conclusion 
in mind he invariably selects not only foreign char- 
acters but also a foreign background ; third, the 
American is a selfish but not a deceitful lover. 

Humor, or an attempt at humor, is the predomi- 
nating note in forty-seven of the 319 stories. In 
forty stories the delineation of the central figure's 
characteristics seems to be the chief end in view. 
The child-story has twenty-eight representatives, six 
of which are classified as humorous. In fifteen of 
these stories, gii-ls have the leading roles ; while 
eleven fall to boys. In two stories the parts are 
of about equal importance. The writers of twenty- 
three stories wrestle with some type of psychological 
pi'oblem, making but little attempt to conceal the 
bald fact. Of course, other writers are more or less 
interested in problems, but they weave them so skil- 
fully into the woof of their stories that they constitute 
only one of the elements of interest. Such stories 
are given diverse classifications. Twenty-one deal 
with one phase or another of married life, problems 
and humor predominating; however, eight of them 
seem best called simply stories of married life. 
Adventure is the predominating note in eighteen 
stories. There are but seven Christmas stories in 
the fourteen magazines. The Western, the detective, 
and the industrial stories have an even half-<lozen 
representatives each. The political field gets five 
stories. The Civil War has not been forgotten, as 
is attested by four authors who found their material 
in that gi-eat conflict. Four others made purely 
sociological studies, and the same number wrote 
fantastic tales. Of the seventeen stories which have 
one or more scenes on board ships, but three of them 
strike me as stories of the sea. To the police, to the 
brigand, to the newspaper, and to mystery solved 
and unsolved, are devoted thi'ee stories each. While 
the Indian appears in six stories, there are but two 
instances in which the chief interest centres in the 
red man and his life. The railroads, ghosts, the 
new woman, anarchy, and football — note the com- 
bination — have two representatives each. There 
are two burlesques on French manners. Two stories 
illustrate the irony of fate ; two more are fairy 
stories. 

Among the animals that have parts in these 
stories are found two dogs, an elephant, a pig, a 
collection of pets, and a horse as raconteur. The 
automobile is used in only three stories. Only seven 
old maids with leading parts are found among the 
several hundred characters. Writers on the race 
question and the labor question are silent ; the golf 
storj', the temperance story, and the story dealing 
with divorce, are also types that are missing.

THE DIAL.

Judging from these stories, the old bachelor, as a 
distinct species, is almost extinct. 

In one story out of five — sixty-six, to be exact — 
one or more of tlie cliai-acters uses a dialect. In 
eleven stories a Western dialect is spoken ; in nine; 
the Irishman's brogue amuses. In seven stories the 
ratal New Englander sj)eaks his Yankee vernaculai"; 
in a half-dozen more, the Frenchman talks English 
with a Parisian accent. The Hebrew is heard in 
five stories, the Dutch in four, and the Slav in the 
same number. Italians, Englishmen, sailors, and 
negroes enunciate in three stories each in their own 
peculiar w^ay. In two stories each the German and 
the mountaineer distort our language. The remain- 
ing four excursions in dialect are hard to classify. 

A note of humor brings to an end forty-three 
stories. The authors of thirty-seven stories leave the 
impression that their leading cliaracters ai-e soon to 
marry ; thirty-six stories conclude with manuage ; 
in twenty-four, engagements are announced. Death 
brings thirty-five stories to their end ; in ten of these 
stories one of tlie leading charactei-s is murderetl. 
Twenty stories condude with the halo of success 
resting on the hero's head ; in fourteen more, rec- 
onciliation is brought about ; in an even dozen cases, 
one of the characters accepts the inevitable and the 
story ends in resignation. Mystery is solved in 
eight stories ; in seven the yoke of tyranny is shaken 
oft', in as many more someone's eyes are opened ; a 
half-dozen contests end with unconditional suiTcn- 
der ; in a like number of cases some peril is averted ; 
in as many more, perfect contentment reigns. Five 
characters repent ; the same number are victorious. 
In foui- stories, separated charactei-s are united ; a 
like number end with a relapse ; a friendly act con- 
cludes three ; insanity has a single victim ; the 
remaining thirty-seven have a vaiiety of conclusions 
wliich fall outside the foregoing classification. 

With no claim to any title other than that of a 
reader of average intelligence. I offer a few obser- 
vations and conclusions for what they may be worth. 

That the psychological story is, when well done, 
perhaps the most subtle of all stories, few will deny. 
But imless the characters are drawn so carefully, so 
time to life, that the end seems inevitable, for me 
at least, the story has no value. StUl, the writers 
of thLs type of story often seem wilfully to neglect 
character delineation. If, as is so often done by the 
writers of the psycliological stories under consider- 
ation, the reader is given mere lay fig^es, it is hard 
to understand how the author can expect him to 
accept the solution. Merely to say what man will 
do under given circumstances seems a waste of 
time ; for are the solutions not innumerable ? That 
the element of surprise, although it is the saving 
grace of many types of stories, has no place in the 
conclusion of a psychological study, appears self- 
evident ; yet it is by no means unusual. Too often 
these wTiters, — through lack of ability to perform 
the really difficult feat of creating a character, or 
because, having the ability, they are unwilling to 
take the time, — forget that it is perfectly legitimate 



to pose a question in the short story without attempt- 
ing to answer it. Simjjly because, with a few deft 
strokes, the masters of this type of story have been 
able to create living chai-acters, and then liave lost 
little time in beginning their psychological analysis, 
it does not follow that anyone who elects to write a 
psychological story has the same ability. For one 
not a genius to attempt to create a character with- 
out the use of action is to attempt an Icarian task. 
That the reader does not get his clearest insight 
into a character while the writer is telling about 
him, but when he is seen in action, is a truth which 
must have been recognized long before the first story 
was written. To say that action is not only the 
medium which introduces a reader to the true nature 
of a character in fiction or of a friend in life, but 
that it is also the medium tliat introduces a reader to 
liimself, is merely to repeat a truism. Still, despite 
these well-recognized facts, action, generally speak- 
ing, is the psychological writer's special aversion. 

The interest in the animal story, which ran ram- 
pant a few years ago, proved the passing whim of 
a changeful public. Notwithstanding the fact that 
a few of the best fiction writers in America to-day 
are giving their time to the child-story, it is hard to 
believe that it is anything more than the popular 
caprice of the hour, and one naturally wonders if it 
is not destined to meet a fate similar to that of the 
animal story. A lack of knowledge of child-life can 
be brought against many of the writers of the child- 
story. The country girl of ten, who supposed a 
mole to be swifter than a dog, and thought that, 
when pursued, a mole would seek shelter in a corn- 
house, is scarcely an exceptional child in the stories 
under consideration. 

As important as is masterly character delineation 
to the interest of the psychologfical study, is humor 
to the chUd-storj'. But instead of humor, most 
of the writers of this type of story are endowed 
with a proud father's loquacity. It is possible to 
listen for a few minutes, with a pretence at patience, 
even to the proudest parent's harangue ; likewise, it 
is possible to read, with patience if not with pleasure, 
say a 3000-word story about a child. But when an 
author, with the persistent loquacity of the proud 
father, insists on pouring out a 10,000-word child- 
story, practically without the essential element of 
humor, it seems time to protest. A fourth of the 
child-stories exceed 6500 words — much above the 
average lengfth of the stories under consideration. 

The number of these stories that turn on events 
imaginatively impossible is really surprising. Grant- 
ing that many unquestionably classic stories have 
this fault, and that more than one of Shakespeare's 
plays turn on incidents that the modern imagination 
rejects, while some critics are willing to overlook 
this fault, it would seem that in this materialistic 
age writers less gifted than the Bard of -Avon might 
consent to base their stories on events that an average 
reader could accept as possible. Fully a fourth of 
these stories could be condemned on this count. 

If the reader puts no check on his pessimism and

looks deep into the hearts of these American story- 
people, he might justly accuse them of many grave 
faults. Still, despite the fact that some of them are 
averse to self-sacrifice, — that when they do surren- 
der it is too frequently a painful process, creating 
the impression that the sacrifice does not come from 
the heart and tliat a rebellion may be expected, — 
that tliere are few all-around lovable characters 
among them, — that their kindness is too often 
brutal in its frankness, — that they have a deejj- 
seated aversion to showing their passions or to 
dying merely to anmse the reader, — one would 
search in vain for a really despicable cliaracter 
among the American story-people found in the 819 
stories read. More than this — there is not one 
among them without some admirable quality.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



9 The Glasgow convention of librarians two 
weeks ago was in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary 
of the founding of the Libi'ary Association of Great 
Britain, an orgiiuizatiou only one year yoimger than the 
American Library Association, the pioneer in the move- 
ment of incorporating and l)ringiiig into mutually 
helpful relations the widespread library interests of a 
whole nation. Among the papers read and discussed at 
Glasgow — some of whicli we shall perhaps take occa- 
sion later to refer to nion^ particularly — were disser- 
tations on " The Librarian and his Relation with Books," 
"The Net Books Question," "Library legislation," 
" New Proposals in Regard to Public Libraries by the 
National Home Reading Union," and, in matters of 
minute practical detail, " Catalogue Rules," and '• Sound 
Leather." Other papers there were, in sufficient abtm- 
dance, of local rather than general interest, such as, 
" The Organization of the Glasgow District Libraries," 
"English and Scottish Royal Heraldry," and "The 
Liability of Public Libraries to be Assessed for Rates 
and Taxes." Comiuentuig editorially ou the history and 
influence of tlie Association, Mr. A. W. Pollard, editor of 
"The Library," well says: " It is certainlj' an extraor- 
dinary witness to the enthusiasm of librarians for their 
work that the history of the association may lie searched 
for a whole generation and hardly a trace will be found 
in it of the urging of any personal pecuniary claims. 
Librarians are loud in demanding more money for tlieir 
libraries, but althougii in proportion to their work they 
are probably the worst paid body of men and women 
in the United Kingtloni, the questions of salaries and 
pension schemes witli which associations of scliool- 
mastei's and schoobnisti-esses are not infrequently con- 
cerned, have hardly ever figured on tlie agenda pajjer 
at eitlier the annual or monthly meeting of the Library 
Association." The same praise is due to our own high- 
minded and devoted librarians — thougli, as salaries go, 
they fai-e better than their fellows of other lands. 

The short detective story, interest in which just 
now seems to be showing renewed freshness, owes what- 
ever excellence it jwssesses to the ingenuity, and also 
the j)lausibility, of its plot. There is commonly little 
character-study in it, little appeal to the emotions other 



than curiosity, little display of tlie finer qualities of style. 
Hence the plot, the mechanism, wliich is nearly ever\'- 
tliing, shoidd be all but faultless; the machinery should 
not creak or break down; the gearing should be nicely 
adjusted to the motive power and tfj the work to be 
performed. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's little adventure 
into this attractive field of fiction in the September 
" Century " is pervaded mth a good deal of the charm 
of the writer's personality. His membership on the 
board of directors of the Library Company of Phila- 
delphia, and his omnivorous passion for books, make 
him perfectly at home in matters of library administra- 
tion and the jxjcuUarities of book-worms; while his 
pi'ofessioual experience enables him to write convinc- 
ingly of doctors and diseases — all of which enter into 
" The Mind Reader." But in his bui'glary he is much 
less of an adept, probablj- from lack of practice with 
the jimmy and other tools of the trade. His whole 
story, which by the way is much longer than the strictly 
detective part requires — but we quarrel not with the 
padding — breaks down when the two burglars are 
seized with terror at the death of the man whose will 
they have stolen, and whose mortal mjury they have 
accidentally caused in effecting their theft. The will, 
however, could have no value for them except in the 
event of the testator's decease; for he could at any 
time b«!fore his death make a new will, thus reducing 
the earlier one to the value of waste paper. But appar- 
ently, and strangely enough, the burglars had planned 
to abstract the will without injuring its maker, and 
then to extort a liandsome payment for the restoration. 
One knows not which most to marvel at, the stupidity 
of the burglars — who, it should be added, left imtouched 
a solid silver table service as l>eing insignificant in value 
compared with the will — or the somnolence of the 
author (and of the editor) in permitting so obvious a 
blunder to pass uncorrected. 

The creator ok "D.\rics Green " Ls quietly and 
contentedly romiding out his four-score years at Arling- 
ton in these pleasant autumn days — symbolic of the 
pleasant autunm of Mr. Trowbridge's busy and useful 
life. The occasion brings to mind the curious story of 
Darius Green of Washington, as thus related by the 
Washington correspondent of a northern paper: " In 
one of my trips througli the Xavy Department I was 
introduced to the chief clerk of the Bureau of Con- 
struction, whose name is Darius (ireen. ' Not the 
Darius Green of flying-machine fame ? ' I asked upon 
hearing his name. ' Exactly,' he replied smiling; 'that 
is just who I am.' He then told me his story. ' Some 
thirty-five years ago,' lie said, ' 1 was a boy attending 
a school at Medford, Mass. One day the poet Trow- 
bridge called ujion the principal, a personal friend, and 
sketched out the plan of Iiis celebrated story of the 
tiying-inacliine. "I have,' he said, "everything how 
except a name for nij- hero. Can 't you find among 
your scholars one that will suit ? " My teacher thought 
over the names of his pupils and mentioned mine to 
Mr. Trowbridge, who accepted it and made me famous.' 
Darius Green was employed in the navy yard of Boston 
[Charlestown] for a number of years. In 1889 he came 
to Washington and accepted his present position in the 
Bureau of Construction." The most curious part of 
the whole storj' is that Mr. Trowbridge denies all 
knowledge of this Medford-Cliarlestown-Washington 
Darius Green, who has certainly demonstrated that he 
has a genius for construction. The poet declares he has

never been inside a Medford schoolroom and has never 
enjoyed the acquaintance of a Medford schoohnaster. 
But the story is one of those that ought to be true, and 
perhaps its inventor believes himself to be discharging a 
moral obligation in upholding its truth.

Mb. Shaw's drastic method of dkauxg wtth 
POVERTY, as advocated in the preface to " John Bull's 
Other Island," appears to be regarded not without favor 
in his own country. Newspaper discussion has been 
gravely carried on as to the undesirability of lessening 
the infant mortality of London's sliuus. What imme- 
diately raised the question was an utterance from Dr. 
W. MacDougall, the psychologist, in the 1906 issue of 
•* Sociological Papers " just put forth by the Sociological 
Society. Speaking of the abolition of infant mortality. 
Dr. MacDougall says: "This is likely to be completely 
effected in the next two years, and we shall then have 
abolished the one factor which in any important degree 
at present tends to redress the balance between the rates 
of reproduction of the superior and inferior classes." 
Professor Flinders Petrie aJso, in his " Janus in Modem 
Life," deprecates this humanitarian effort to rescue the 
poor babies and add them to the toiling millions of men 
and women. '• It would be." he declares, " from the 
lowest type of careless, thriftless, dirty and incapable 
families that the increase would be obtained." " Is it 
worth while," he asks, •• to dilute our increase of popu- 
lation by ten per cent more of the most inferior kind ? 
Will England be stronger for having one-thirtieth more, 
and that of the worst stock, added to the population 
every year?" To this Dr. C. W. Saleeby replies that 
it is untrue to speak of infant mortality as a " natural 
weeding-out of the unfit " ; that the victims are bom 
capable of rendering a good account of themselves if 
only given a fair chance; and that West-End children, 
if exposed to the same perik and hardships, would fare 
no better. Yes, the time has passed when it was hon- 
estly believed that one war in a generation was beneficial 
and even necessary as a natural blood-letting to the 
plethoric body of the nation.

LiTKRART TAP FOR INFANT MINDS is increasing 
greatly in quantity. Taking pattern after — and some- 
times a long way after — the admirable " Tales from 
Shakespeare," volume after volume has appeared of 
stories from Homer and Herodotus, from Chaucer and 
Froissart, from the travels of Lemuel Gulliver and the 
adventures of the ingenious Knight of La Mancha, with 
innumerable other juvenile editions and adaptations of 
famous classics. Is there wisdom in this anticipatory 
action of kind-hearted literary ladies and gentlemen of 
unoriginal or uncreative bent ? It is something like 
feeding the child with plums out of the pudding, or 
with frosting from the cake, or like gi\'ing him a peep 
at his presents before Christmas has come. There is 
danger of disenchantment in this. Children have a 
plenty of books written originally for them; why then 
deprive them of the pleasure and exliilaration of discov- 
ering all these masterpieces for themselves? Adapta- 
tions and abridgments may even engender disgust for 
the complete work and prevent its ever being opened. 
The writer remembers, or has been told by his mother, 
tiiat as a small child he resented any attempt to tell 
hun the Bible stories in any but the Bible language. 
Aud so it well may be and doubtless often is the case 
that benevolent endeavors to bring an old author down 



to the boy's or girl's comprehension merely result in 
robbing the author of his peculiar charm and causing 
him thereafter to be neglected. These considerations 
are suggested by the current issue of a series of juvenile 
adaptations and simplifications; and though we may be 
in the wrong, the question is worthy at least of a pas.sing 
thought, perhaps even of serious discussion. 
• • • 
The discovery of another English author is to 
be credited to us. Miss May Sinclair, whose remarkable 
novel, " The Helpmate," has been holding the wonder- 
ing attention of so many readers of "The Atlantic 
Monthly," appears to be somewhat neglected in her own 
oonntry. Over there, as we are uiformed, they find her 
last book " dull," perhaps because it is so commendably 
free from all ambitious attempt to picture the smart 
set, and depends for its interest on a realistic present- 
iflent of middle-class tvpes. Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer 
gives us the welcome information that Miss Sinclair 
(that is her real name) is so genuinely modest and 
imassuming that she will never do anything to get her 
picture into the papers, nor will she ever force herself 
on public attention otherwise than by the excellence of 
her literary work. Though she discusses marital prob- 
lems with the seeming experience of a much-married 
person, she is still single. Perhaps, indeed, the latter 
fact partly explains the former. Her undaunted way 
of handling a serious and delicate situation in " The 
Helpmate " makes one suspect her of failing to realize 
the full gravity of the case. Mr. Hueffer, who some- 
what patronizingly commends his countrywoman's work 
as " promising and encouraging." tells us that she is 
" little, precise, quiet, young, restrained, and observant," 
and that " after you had talked to her for an hour you 
would say she was ' nice,' but you would know nothing 
about what she thought. She would probably know a 
good deal about you." ... 

A doleful view of modern humor is that taken 
by the editor of " Blackwood's Magazine " in some vio- 
lently reactionary reflections on the late-belauded Mark 
Twain. The humor of to-day, the writer points out, is 
based on the obviously incongruous; and it goes to un- 
warrantable lengths in its flippancy and impertinence, 
holding nothing sacred and respecting no traditions. 
Three Englishmen — with shame be it confessed — - are 
the originators of this disrespectful style of funniness; 
and their names are Tom Brown, Ned Ward, and Charles 
Cotton. But our honored Mark has bettered the orig- 
inal, so that he is now accused of being a perfect monster 
of coarseness, " a bull in the china-shop of ideas." And, 
further, " he attempts to destroy what he could never 
biuld up, and assumes that his experiment is merito- 
rious." Of the " Yankee at King Arthur's Court " the 
same angry pen saj's that it is " such a masterpiece of 
vulgarity as the world has never seen " ; and our old 
friends — or young friends, rather • — Tom Sawyer and 
Huck Finn are " two boys who will survive to cast 
shame on all the humour of America." Not that their 
creator is without gifts; on the contrary, "it is for the 
sake of a genuine talent that we deplore Mark Twain's 
studied antics." What can be said in reply, to calm the 
dear old Maga's ruffled temper ? Exaggeration and 
occasioual bad taste must be admitted in our champion 
humorist. But who can read his later writings, the 
published chapters of his autobiography, the utterances 
of his serious and tender moods, and hold him guilty of 
all that is charged in the indictment ?

Thk PIPK-DREAM8 OF INVKNT0R8, if gathered into a 
"volume, would make most aimising reading. It was 
not long ago tliat a prospectus was issued by a brilliant 
genius who solicited the attention of would-be investoi-s 
to his grand scheme for di'awing on tlie Oliniitable stores 
of electricity waiting only to be tapped in the blue vault 
of heaven. Drawn earthward, this electric energy would 
do all the work of the world, while man sat at ease and 
twirled his thumbs. The only thuig required was to 
make connection with the reservoii' by means of a copper 
wire. To do this it was proposed to discharge a mam- 
moth cannon heavenward from the top of Pike's Peak, 
the projectile to carry the end of the wire and to be 
hurled with such force toward the zenith that it would 
pass beyond the reach of gravitation and remain forever 
poised in space. But all this was to cost money at the 
outset. Now, however, we have a scheme for develoj)- 
ing energy that is to cost but a mere trifle from the very 
start. Signor RafHe Bova, an Italian electrician, has 
come all the way from Carinola, Italy, to demonstrate 
before American experts the surpassing merits of his 
invention "for rumiiug the largest dynamos without 
steam or other energy." All that is recjuired for this 
is a small battery, no larger than that attached to an 
electi'ic door-bell, and a transforming apparatus. " In 
building a fire," says our plausible inventor, " one must 
have a match. I have diseovei'ed the match of elec- 
tricity, and with it can start the lire that continues to 
burn. In other word.s, with a substance to be obtained 
anywhere for a few cents, I originate the force that sets 
the dynamo in motion and continues it in action." There 
is miaccountable mention of a considerable sum of money 
requii-ed to install the new system ; but this " installation 
expense " may be another name for the inventor's fee. 
The sum and substance of it all probably is that another 
dreamer, of the pei-petual-motion oi'der, has allowed liis 
imagination to run riot in schemes for getting something 
at Dame Nature's bargain-counter below cost.

A BLDO) poet's plaint is uttered in appealingly 
pathetic accents in Mr. Morris Rosenfeld's denial of the

that I am still alive, although death would be far 
preferable to my present condition. ... I live ui eternal 
darkness, for I am blind. The light of day has left me, 
and only misery remains. The bourgeoisie, in their 
splendid palaces, pretended to have heard nothing of 
the songs of the proletariat, and only my brethren, 
whom the echo of my muse had reached, sought me in 
order to assist their blind bard." He tells the sad 
story of his illness and poverty, the sufferings of his 
wife and childi'en, his falling into the usurer's clutches, 
and (as he believes) the malicious publication of the 
report of his death in order that liis few patrons might 
withdraw their help. " The publishers of my poems," 
he continues, "have had them translated into all lan- 
guages without paying me a farthing. Now that they 
have heai'd the news of my death they .send wreaths to 
be placed on the gi-ave of the blind singer, in owler that 
they, the wealthy, may be able to say that they have 
paid the tribute of their admiration. But henceforth I 
and my children will thank only those who sacrificed 
their last crust of bread to help us." Although there 
is something a little strained, a little hysterical, in the 
letter, it reveals a condition of undoubted mental and 
physical distress, and one that Mr. Rosenfeld's fellow 
Hebrews must feel urgently called upon to relieve.

in the rudiments of civics and put in the way of becom- 
ing good and intelligent citizens of their adopted coiui-

written by volunteers, each versed in his subject, and 
all imbued vrith a desire to help the immigrant and to 
promote the public good. A prominent clergyman con- 
tributes the opening chapter, " The Tlireefold Govern- 
ment We Live Under," a public-spirited member of 
the city council gives an account of the city laws, a 
leading educator writes on " Our Schools and Libraries," 
and an accomplished woman tells briefly " The Story of 
Boston." Other chapters treat of naturalization, cor- 
nipt practices, the privileges and duties of citizenship, 
and kindred subjects. Poems and .songs of civic life 
are appended, together vfith the constitution of our 
coimtry, the Declaration of Independence, and a variety 
of other matter. This is all admirable, but of course 
the more admirable thing to accomplish will be to get 
the book read, and pondered, and profited by. Like

been irresistible even to liis enemies. Standing

was deaf and dumb, followed Garrick's per- 
formanws with close attention, and said he

•• I have this moment receiv"d a most charm- 
ing letter from my dear, amiable Riccoboni," 
writes Grarrick in September. 1768. But first 
a w ortl aVtout Matlame Riccoboni and her letter. 
She was a French woman and a writer of novels, 
and by way of varietj* wished to translate some 
of the Ganick jilays for production on the Paris 
stage. Her letter LH}ntains certain remarks 
on translation which elicit her correspondent's 
praise. •• My friend," she says. " the taste of all 
nations accords on certain points : the natural, 
truth, sentiment, interest equally the English- 
man, the Frenchman, the Russian, the Turk. 
But wit, badinage, the quip, the jesting tone, 
change in name as the cUmate chaJuges. That 
which is lively, light, graceful in one language. 
l>ecomes cold, heaAy. insipid or gros.s in another : 
pi-ecision, accuracy, the sources of the charm, no 
longer exist. That which would rouse a burst 
of laughter in France, might cause a howl in 
London or Vienna. Everywhere hmuor de- 
pends on nothing, and that nothing is local. 
Usually those who make a business of trans- 
lating have verj' little idea of these delicate 
shadings : consequently I have never seen an 
endurable translation." Garricks reply to this 
illustrates incidentaUy his fondness for flattery 
and his ovra liabit of flattering in return. He 
wTites. in jiart : 

" \ ou have really given so true and ingenious Acwoimt 
of national taste with regard to the Drama, that it would

uame with all his Suite Yesterday to see my house &

vain should I tell you what he said, & I hope you will 
think me sincere, when I tell you that I had rather see 
You & yr friend there than all the Kinjjs & Princes of 
Eui-ope." 

This well-kiiowji love of sweet doses is agaia 
in evidence in a later letter to Miss Cadogan. 
" You will be glad to know,' he adds in a post- 
script, that Mrs- Barbauld late Miss Aikin 
wrote y® following distich upon Miss More's 
shewing her my Buckles my Wife gave her, 
which I play'd in y^ last Night of Acting." 
Then follows the couplet : 

" Thy Buckles, O (Jarrick, thy Friends may now Use, 
But no Mortals hereafter shall stand in thy Shoes." 

Some of Garrick's troubles and embarrass- 
ments as a theatre manager — embarrassments 
peculiar to his time and to his tempei-ament — 
are revealed in a letter of the year 1759 to 
Lord Holderness (Robert D 'Arcy, fourth Earl 
of Holderness, who was appointed a Secretary 
of State in 1761). 

" I have taken the Liberty to send Your I^ordship a 
Copy of ye Guardian before publication; could I pos- 
sibly shew my Respect & Gratitude in things of more 
importance I certainly would, but I deal in Triffles, & 
have Nothing Else in ray Power. Prince Edward ask'd 
me last Night, who was the Author of y® Farce ; I was 
in great Confusion at y" Question, because I happen'd 
to be the Guilty person Myself, But I have so many 
Enemies among the Writers on Account of my refusing 
so many of their Performances Every Y'^ear, that I am 
oblig'd to conceal Myself in order to avoid the Torrent 
of abuse that their Malice would pour upon Me — I 
thought it proper (and I hope Your Lordship will 
Excuse Me) to discover this; lest his Royal Highness 
should be angry at my not answering his Question 
directly, as I ought to have done — as Your Lordship 
well understands my disagreeable Situation, may I hope 
to have so good an Advocate as Lord [erasure and 
blank]? It is of Great Consequence to me to Conceal 
tlie Author of y* Guardian, but it is of ye Utmost to Me 
not to be foimd Wanting in ye least Article of my Duty 
to his Royal Highness." 

This and the letter immediately following it, 
to the same person, show the somewhat ticklish 
relations, as the editor points out, " of a mana^ 
ger of one of the two patent theatres to the 
Court. Though neither company, in the middle 
of the eighteenth century, was still called ' His 
Majesty's Servants,' Garrick's words prove that 
he felt his own comings and goings were under 
surveillance, and thought it was wise to ask for 
a consent, at least formally necessary, before 
leaving the stage during the season."' The 
opening (to quote no more) of the second letter 
to Holderness is instructive. 

" I have been so much indulg'd by your Goodness, 
that I shall venture to open my Griefs to Y''our Lord- 



ship — It is my greatest Ambition that the Company of 
Drury-Ijane should not appear unworthy of his Royal 
Highness's Conunands — but indeed I am affraid, from 
a late Rehearsal, that the Comedy of Every Man in his 
humor will disgrace Us, If I have not a little more time 
for instruction — the Language and Characters of Ben 
Jonson (and particularly of the Comedy iu question) 
are much more difficult than those of any otlier W^riter, 
& I was three years before I durst venture to trust the 
Comedians with their Characters, wheu it was first 
I'evived." 

The lettei's as a whole tend to corroborate 
the evidence of Goldsmith's clever lines in 
" Retaliation," that the great actor was " an 
abridgment of all that was pleasant in man "; 
but at the same time 

" He east off his friends, as a huntsman his pack. 
For he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them 

back. 
Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow'd what came, 
And the puff of a dunce, he mistook it for fame." 

In point of editorship, the extreme care taken 
to reproduce, as far as possible in print, the 
letter-writer's peculiarities of spelling and 
punctuation, his frequent use of the caret, and 
his arbitrary employment of capitals, tends to 
preserve the indefinable eighteenth-century 
atmosphere of the documents, but makes them 
less rapidly readable to twentieth-century eyes. 
In lack of an index, page-headings to show who 
is being addressed by the writer would have 
been very welcome ; sometimes it is impossible 
to determine this without some search, or to 
ascertain at once the probable date of a letter. 
The great number of extant Garrick portraits 
has made possible the publication in this volume 
of many interesting pictures of the man and 
the actor. Percy F. Bicknell. 



A DUAMATIC HiSTOUIAX.* 



A well- in vented if apocryphal anecdote relates 
that the German Emperor, in his schoolboy 
days, being asked to state the difference between 
Herodotus and Thucydides, replied : " The one 
I could understand, the other I couldn't." This 
is doubtless one of the most important distinc- 
tions for the tyro. But there are others. 
Although but a few years separate the father 
of history from his great successor, we find 
ourselves with the latter in another world. 
Herodotus is a charming, gossipy story-teller, 
who delights in omens and prodigies and oracles, 
and strange traveller's tales and all the marvels 
of the " brave new world that hath such people

in it." His only philosophy of history and 
criticism of life is a no'ire faith that a jealous 
Grod loves to humble swollen fortunes, " but 
the little ones do not provoke him at all." 

Thuevdides, on the other liand, is a hard- 
heatled political JK>siti^•ist, the ancestor of 
3>Iachiavelli and Guieciardini and La Rochefou- 
cauld, — sensitive as a Greek and an artist to 
the dramatic values of historA'. but as a thinker 
far more deeply interested in his cold cynical 
analysis of the conduct and motives of the 
political animal, man. There is no other his- 
toric narrative at once st> \ivid and minute and 
so completely intelleetualized, so interpenetrated 
and fused with ethic^al and political reflection, 
as is Thucydides's aw-ount of the Peloponnesian 
war. And the appreciative reader, however 
deeply he may feel the pity of what Ruskin 
calls '' the central tragedy of all the world, the 
suicide of Greece." however sensitive he may 
be to the pathos of the Retreat from Syracuse 
which Macaulay and Gray thought the finest 
thing in historical literature. w"ill still realize 
that it is this Thucydidean criticism of life that 
makes the History, in its author's boast, "a 
possession for all time, and not a prize composi- 
tion which is heard and forgotten." 

Though we have reaUy little means of con- 
trolling Thucydides's statements of fact, this 
informing philosophy, and the impression pro- 
duced by his austere self-restraint in speaking 
of friend or foe, have matle his historical trust- 
worthiness almost an article of faith with 
modern critics. But dogmas are made to be 
challenged, and the challenge implied in Mr. 
Comford's title, " Thucydides Mj-thistori- 
cus," is maintained in his book in a fashion 
which will be stimulating: and sug^gestive even 
to those who c^annot accept its conclusions. Mr. 
Comford does not impugn the conscious good- 
faith of the historian. He merely seeks to 
show that we are under an illusion when on 
the ground of certain striking utterances we 
attribute to him a completely consistent modem 
scientific and positivist point of view. Thucy- 
dides himself thought that he had discarded 
the old mytholog>% and endeavored to erplain 
everything by the ine^^table operation of the 
laws of human nature in given conditions. But 
the mythological imagination still dominated 
his mind, and it was imjx)ssible for him to cast 
his historj' in any other mould than that which 
mythology and tragedy had imposed upon all 
Greek thought and art. 

In support of this thesis. Air. Comford 
expounds Thucydides's general philosophy of 



hiunan nature, taking as his text the speech of 
Diodotus on the insufficiency of the fear of 
punishment to oomlMit Hope. Confidence, and 
Passionate Desire. The ex]X)sition corres- 
ponds so closely — though from the lack of 
acknowledgment it would appear undesig- 
nedly — with that which I (Irew from the 
same text in a jiaper on the -Implicit Ethics 
and Psychology of Thucydides,'' that I need 
only express my natural concurrence, without 
attempting to criticize. Here, however, the 
resemblance ends. The psycholognf which 1 
worked out in illustration of Thucydides's polite 
ical positi^^sm, Mr. Comford r^ards as the 
starting-point of a new mj'thology. You need 
only add capital letters to the elements of hu- 
man natiu^e in Thucydides's analysis, in order to 
reinstate the unseen djemonic personifications 
that govern human destiny in Greek poetry and 
tragedy. For this startlingly simple transfor- 
mation, we are, however, prepared by some 
general considerations against attributing to a 
thinker of that day a purely scientific attitude. 
Thucydides may seem to ignore the possibility of 
cMicrete supernatural inter\"ention in the course 
of human affairs, and he may have refused to 
affirm anything for which he had not good evi- 
dence : but he had no positive conception of 
what we mean by the •• reign of law " to fill the 
gap. for the sciencjes did not yet exist. His 
explanations of historical events are individu- 
alistic and psychological, where ours are col- 
lective, economic, and sociological. He traces 
everything to the character, the motives, the 
hopes, fears, and desires of indi>-iduals, where 
our science recognizes large abstract economic 
and stx^ial laws inevitably determining the ac- 
tions of masses. Moreover, though chance may 
have Ijeen in theory for him what it is for us, a 
mere synonjTu of the incalculable, it could not 
in his imagination be excluded from a place 
among the ultimate causes of things by the more 
exact detail of mcxlem knowledge. Thus, what- 
ever his philosophic conviction, his dramatic 
instinct remained free to personify Chance or 
Fortune as a real agent coordinate or coopera- 
tive with the (capitalized) Personified Passions 
which his |>sychology discovered in human na- 
tiu^. 

And as a matter of fact, Mr. Comford finds 
that Thucydides's (inception of historical causes 
is unscientific, and that his narrative is uncon- 
sciously colored by poetic and dramatic pre- 
conceptions. He tells us. for example, that the 
real c-ause of the Peloponnesian War was the 
alarm felt by Sparta at the growing power of 



204

the Athenian Empire, Init that the causes openly 
avowed were the quarrels over Coreyi-a and 
Potidsea, which he proceeds to describe. The 
word which he uses for the real cause (pyoplia.six) 
might mean pretext, but probably does mean 
occasion employetl as a loose synonym for vaHae. 
The word used for the alleged causes is (litiai, 
which in philosophical Gi-eek means causes, but 
in early common usage rather suggests gi-iev- 
ances, or complaints. Anthropologists tell us 
that " when pximitive man asks the cause of 
anything, he wants to know who is to blame." 
Mr. Comford infers that Thucydides had neither 
the word nor the idea cauHc, but coidd speak 
only of grievances or pretexts. This, 1 think, 
is to press his accidental use of terms too hard. 
But Mr. Cornford's argument need not rest on 
this verbal considei-ation. He tries to show that 
as a matter of fact Thucydides misap})rehended 
the true causes of the war, which were e<;onomic. 
Chief among them was the desire of the com- 
mercial population of Athens and the Peirieus 
to win the trade of the West. This they could 
do, in the absence of steam and the mariner's 
compass, only by the Isthmian route. But 
Corinth and Megara held the Isthmus. The 
only chance of Athens, then, was to win over 
or subjugate Megara. Hence the decrees in- 
tended to coerce Megara, or starve her out by 
excluding her from all ports of the Athenian 
Empire. Aristophanes and some of the later 
historians actually represent the Megarian de- 
ci-ees as the chief cause of the war. Thucydides 
himself lets fall a phrase or two that implies it. 
But lacking the modern scientific conception 
of the social and economic nature of historical 
causes, he falls back upon his pei"sonal and 
psychological standpoint, and occupies himself 
chiefly with description of the feelings and argu- 
ments of Athenians, Corinthians, and S})artans, 
on the eve of the war. 

For the same reason, accordmg to Mr. Corn- 
ford, in his account of subsequent campaigns in 
the Corinthian gidf , he fails to exhibit to us the 
i-eal unity of purjjose that determined Athenian 
activity in this direction, and gives us the im- 
pression of a series of disconnected and desultory 
enterprises. Similarly, though he enables us to 
infer, he fails to state clearly tliat the Sicilian 
expedition was merely the culmination of designs 
of imperial expansion in the West long cher- 
ished by the commei-cial party. His di-aniatic 
conception is that this lust for conquest in Sicily. 
Italy, Carthage even, was a tragic infatuation 
of the demagogxie-led democracy after tlie death 
of Pericles. And he is therefore unable, or 



instinctively unwilling, to give due prominence 
to the facts tliat show that the commercial and 
jwpular party atlvotjated this policy from the 
beginning, and that, as our author believes. 
Pericles himself was forced by this party to 
pass the Megaiian decrees. Such an admission 
would have marred the symmetry of his picture 
of the OljTnpian ruler who led the jieople but 
wa.s never led by them. This is all very ingen- 
ious, but it is still ojien to less subtle minds to 
believe that the main cause of the war was, as 
the historian affirms, Peloponnesian jealousy of 
the Athenian P^mpire. And surely Mr. Coi-n- 
ford is inconsistent, both with himself and the 
plain facts, when he elsewhere suggests that 
Thucydides actually l)elieved that Pericles's 
inveteracy against Megara was the ate of an 
inherited curse. For Thucydides clearly held 
that the war was well ai^lvised, and that Athens 
would have won but for the blunders of Pericles's 
successors. 

More plausible is Mr. Cornford's contention 
that Thucydides's apprehension of the facts of 
history, and still more the form of his artistic 
presentation of them, is determined by his 
imaginative conception of Fortime as the chief 
actor in a drama in which the jiersonified pas- 
sions of human nature take the other rblex. The 
real dramatic interest of the History begins, he 
tells us in the third book, with the first im- 
portant success of the Athenians — the capture 
of the four huntbed Spartans at Pylos. It may 
be tliat this achievement was largely a stroke of 
luck. But Thucydides's dramatic instinct leads 
him to represent it as wholly so. The war has 
been di-agging on monotonously, and is aj>- 
proaching a deadlock. A siulden intervention 
of Tuche as deus ex inachina exalts the Athenian 
temjier to the height of hope, greed, pride, and 
hubris, which leads Inevitably to the ti-agic 
reversal of fortune and the abyss of Ate. So 
the story wins an impressive unity. Mr. 
Cornford, in his analysis of the tale of Pylos, 
tries to show (1) that a g-eneral impression of 
casualness and want of design is conveyetl by 
innumerable little touches ; and (2) that it is in 
fact highly improbable that either the occupa- 
tion of Pylos or the capture of the Spartans was 
as accidental as Thucydides represents them. 
However tliat may be, the di-amatic impi-ession 
of the decisive intervention of Tuche in a crisis 
of human affairs is confirmetl by the story of 
Cleon's boast that he could capture the entrapped 
Spartans in a few days, and by the actual 
accoiuplishmeut of the vaiuit " mud as it ivas." 
Cleon the demagogue becomes at this point a

logical mythologj' with which he replaces the 
mythology of the jxjets. This is the mould of 
^Eschylean tragedy into which he casts the i 
drama of history-. , 

Mr. Comford's elaboration of this analogy, 
and his minute and subtle c-omparisons with the 
Agamemnon, will especially interest that c-on- 
siderable body of students who, in the decay of | 
all^^)ry as an acc-eptcd literary- form, satisfy | 
the natural human instinct for this play of 
fancy by coquetting with the allegorical inter- 
pretation of the literature of the past. This 
would be a hamdess amusement if it did not 
ine%"itably betray its devotees into the making 
of false points and the strained interpretation 
of their texts. That Thucytlides's sense of the 
moral significance and the tlramatic contrasts 
of history wa-s quickeneil by reminiscences of 
^EschyleMi tragedy, is probable enough. But 
sober criticism will know how to make a light

that unbiased observers of nature, even unbiased 
amateur observers, have been more numerous, 
first and last, than the Opium-Eater imagines, 
we may nevertheless give heed to his implied 
praise of the undazed and xmcheated filibuster 
whose works are the theme of this re\-iew . Since 
the days of the dear-seeing Greeks, relatively- 
few among men could as honestly as Dampier 
advance the Wordsworthian claim, "I have at 
all times endeavored to look steadily at my 
subject," or, " I have written with my ej'e fixed 
upon the object." 

And who was the admirable Dampier? 
WiUiam Dampier, pirate, captain in the Royal 
Navy, amateur naturalist and geographer, ^-as 
bom in Somersetshire. England, in 1652. After 
a brief schooling in the rudiments, he was 
apprenticed to a master-mariner of Weymouth, 
became a foremast-hand under Bantam, saw 
service on the flag-ship of Sir Edward Spragge 
in the second Dutch war, and at length, in 1679. 
joined a company of buccaneers in the West 
Indies. Crossing the Isthmus of Panama, they 
ravaged the Spanish settlements on the Pacific 
coasts of Central and South America. With 
various leaders, such as Sharp. Sawkins, Davis, 
and Swan, he followed the career of freebooter 
imtil 1688 : in that year, ha^-ing accomplished 
an arduou-s passage across the southern Pacific 
to the island of Guam, he was left on shore at 
the Nicobar Islands. Recovering from a long 
illness, he made one or two trading expeditions 
in the East Indies, then obtained the post of 
master-gtmner at Bencoulen in Sumatra, and 
finally succeetled in reaching England again in 
1691. Of his movements during the next six 
years almost nothing is known. In 1697, how- 
ever, he published his first volume. " A New 
Voyage Roimd the World." which brought him 
into general notice, and paved the wa)' for his 
later works. These are included in the present 
reprint. Through the influence now at^nired, 
Dampier was sent in 1698 to explore the coasbs 
of Australia, New Guinea, etc., an undertaking 
which added little to his fame ; for on the way 
home his ship "founderetl through perfect age 
at the Island of Ascension," and, when rescued, 
he returned in 1 702. oidy to be fined by court- 
martial for alleged severity to his lieutenant. 
Subsequently he was accused of incompetence 
as commander of a privateer in the South Seas : 
whereupon he made answer in his ill-tempered 
and not whoUv reassuring •• Vindication." In 
1708, on his fourth circumna\Tgation of the 
^obe, he was pilot to Captain Woodes-Rogers, 
who liberated Alexander Selkirk (Cowper's 



206 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Selkiili) from the " Isle of John Fernando," 
and who from various sources, during a cruise 
of three years and a half, " conveyed " booty to 
the amount of nearly a million dollars. On this 
cruise one of Dampier's companions was the 
superstitious Hatley, the man who, on a previous 
voyage with Shelvocke, had shot the albatross 
which was later to be immortalized by Coleridge 
and Wordsworth in " The Rime of the Ancient 
Mariner." Dampier died in London in 1715. 
So much for his life externally. 

But what was the gentle iilibuster himself ? 
Let us look at his picture as reproduced in Mr. 
Masefield's fii-st volume ; or, rather, let us listen 
to Admiral Smyth's description of the original 
by Murray in " The National Porti-ait OaUery ": 

" The face is resolute and grave, sailor-like and 
weather-beaten, with considerable breadth above the 
eyes, and the forehead shadowed by a profusion of dark 
auburn hair, which reaches to the shoidders. The body 
is well-built but spare. . . . He is habited in a light- 
blue coat with vellum button-holes, and weai-s a wliite 
neck - cloth of suftieient volume to startle a Beau 
Brumrael. . . . The attitude is easy ; and m his right 
hand is [a copy of] ' Dampier's Voyages,' conveniently 
turned toward the i-eader." 

This sketch tallies fairly well with a glimpse of 
the long and lank and brown man given by 
himseK : 

" It was well for Captain Swan [says Dampier of 
their arrival at the island of Guam] thiit we got sight 
of it before om' pi-ovision was spent, of which we had 
but enough for three days more; for, as I was after- 
wards informed, the men had contrived, tirst to kill 
Captain Swan and eat him when the victuals were gone, 
and after him all of us who were accessory in promoting 
the undertaking of this voyage. This made Captain 
Swan say to me ..." Ah ! Dampier, you would have 
made them but a poor meal; ' for I was as lean as the 
Captain was lusty aud fleshy." 

It is pathetic, urges Mr. Masefield, — 
"To think of him ['a man,' as Coleridge says, 'of 
exquisite refinement of mind ' ], wi-iting up his jom-nal, 
describing a bmich of flowers, or a Rire fish, in the 
intervals between looting a wine-ship and sacking a vil- 
lage. . . . His best book was written aboard a buccaneer 
cruiser, amid the drunkemiess and noise of his sliip- 
mates. He must have gone without sleep many times 
(a sailor will appreciate the .sacrifice) in order to 'take 
a sm-vey,' or drawing of the coast. When he went ashore 
he did not follow liis mates into the rumshops. . . . [' I 
did ever abhor dnmkeuness,' he declares.] He exaramed 
the natives and the comitry, aud jotted down every 
detail of every bird, beast, tree, and fruit, which he 
chanced to see. . . . The supreme faithfidness of 
Dampier's chronicling can only be gauged by those who 
take the trouble to compare the work of even the very 
best of the chronielei-s who have succeeded him." 

In an age when Dryden and Pope ha^:! taught 
England to gaze at natui-e through a distorting- 
atmosphere of pseudo-Latin rhetoric, Dampier 
is almost unique, even among ti-aveUers, for his 



Greek way of seeing things as they were. " All 
men," observes Aristotle, though he must have 
been thinking chiefly of his own race, " all men 
by nature desire to know." Dampier was one 
of those in whom the desire had become a 
passion. 

Of Dampier's career and character as a whole. 
Admiral Smyth gives the following summary, 
which could scai-cely be bettered : 

" On a strict, and we hojK- impai'tial, investigation, it 
appears that his mind was acute, sagacious, and compre- 
hensive; and none of tlie misadventures that we have 
related can be traced to his want of ability or conduct. 
Though cast by fortune upon a course of life which he 
never attempted to justify or palliate, and amidst the 
vicissitudes and temptations to which it exposed him, he 
never imbibed the virus of such vicious companionship. 
Embarking with those marauders rather from a desire 
of acquiring knowledge, tlian the usual motives which 
influenced his shipmates, the constant and powerful 
opei-ation of this desire preserved his mind untainted. 
Hence, even among the lawless, liis attitude was vigor- 
ous and commanding; and whenever his companions 
were in extreme danger, his skill and experience, whieli 
were always available, secured him their respect and 
obedience. If we except the capital error of falling into 
that course, full approbation must be rendered to his 
justice, moderation, liberaUty, temperance, piety, and 
himianity." 

And now for Dampier's writings. In Mr. 
Masefield's reprint the type is clear and the 
editing generally excellent. The introductory 
memoir might indeed have been fuller, for 
Admiral Smyth's standard biographical sketch 
in the "United Ser\'ice Journal " is now seventy 
years old, and no longer ea.sy to find. From 
Mr. Masefield's index we miss several entries, 
among them the name of Selkirk. For the rest, 
let Dampier be his own chief spokesman. 

" As for the Actions of the Company among whom I 
made the greatest part of this [the ' New '] Voyage, a 
Thread of which I have carried on thro' it, 't is not to 
divert the Reader with them that I mention them, much 
less that I take any pleasure in relating them: but for 
methods sake. ... As to my Stile, it cannot be expected, 
that a Seaman should affect Politeness. . . . My chief 
Cai'e hath l)een to be as particidar as was consistent 
with my intended brevitj', in setting down such Observ- 
ables as I met \vith." 

Here is one of his " Observables," taken 
almost at random : 

" The Sea-Lion is a large Creature about 12 or 14 
foot long. The biggest part of his Body is as big as a 
Bull: It is shaped like a Seal, but six times as big. The 
Head is like a Lion's Head; it hath a broad Face with 
many long Hah's growing about its Lips like a Cat. It 
has a great Goggle Eye, the Teeth 3 inches long, aljout 
the bigness of a Man's Tlmmb: In Captain Sharp's 
time, some of our Men made Dice with them. They 
have no Hair on their Bodies like the Seal; they are of 
a dim colour, and are all extraordiiuiry fat; one of them 
being cut u\) and boiled, will yield a Hogshead of Oil,

which is very sweet and wholesome to fry Meat withal. 
The lean Flesh is black, aiid of a coarse Grain; yet 
indifferent good food." 

In his touches of narrative, Dampier is Wjually 
neat. 

" March the 22d, 1(584, we came in sight of [Juan 
Fernandez], and the next day . . . went ashore to see 
for a Moskito Indian, whom we left here when we were 
chased hence by 3 Spanish Ships in the year 1681 ; . . . 
Capt. Watlin being then our Commander. 

•'He was in the Woods, hunting for Goats, when 
Capt. Watlin drew off his Men, and the Sliip was imder 
sail before he came back t<i shore. He luul with him 
his Gtm and a Knife, with a small Horn of Powder, and 
a few Shot; which being spent, he contrived a way by 
notching his Knife, to saw the Barrel of his Gun into 
small Pieces, wherewith he made Harpoons, Lauces, 
Hooks and a long knife: heating the pieces first in the 
fire, which he struck with his Gun-flint. . . . 

" With such instruments as he made in that manner, 
he got such Provision as the Island afforded; either 
Goats or Fish. He told us that at first he was forced 
to eat Seal, which is very ordinary Meat, before he had 
made Hooks: but afterwards he never kiUed any Seals 
but to make Lines, cutting their Skins into Thongs. He 
had a little House or Hut lialf a Mile from the Sea, 
which was lin'd with Gojits Skin ; his Couch or Barbecu 
of Sticks lying along about 2 foot distant from the 
Ground, was spread with the same, and was aU his 
Bedding. . . . He came then to the Sea side to con- 
gratulate onr safe Arrival. And when we landed, a 
Moskito Indian, named Robin, first leap'd ashore, and 
mnning t<i his Brother Moskito Man, threw himself 
flat on his face at his feet, who helping him up, and | 
embracing him, fell flat with his face on the Ground at 
Robin's feet, and was by him taken up also. . . . He 
was named Will, as the other was Kobin. These were ', 
names g^iven them by the English; for . . . they take ; 
it as a great favour to be named by any of us; and will 
complain for want of it, if we do not appoint them some 
name when they are with us; saying of themselves they ; 
are poor Men, and have no Name." 

That is the sort of living material from which , 
imaginative tales of adventure spring. Out of 
such germs have developetl t\-j)es all the way 
from Man Friday in " Robinson Crusoe " ' to Ben 
Gim in '• Treasure Island." ]VIr. Masefield and 
his publishers have done well to bring the 
material in Dampier before the public again, if 
only for its interest in the history of literature. 
There can be little doubt that this naive and 
veracious '• Journal of every Days Observa- 
tions " had an extended iuHuence on some of 
the literature that followed it. Swift, though 
he makes Captain Lemuel Gulliver sneer at 
••my cousin Dampier." must imdemeath his 
satire have really felt an admiratiou for the 
simplicity and directness of the buccaneer's 
English. As for Defoe, it would be fascinating 
to study out the connection between Robinson 
Crusoe and Dampier's '• Voyages," or between 
these and Defoe's own " New Voyage Round 
the World.'" It would be still more profitable. 



no doubt, to determine what effect a highly 
popular yet essentially scientific record, such as 
Dampier's, may have had upon the imaginative 
prose of the early eighteenth century ; for the 
so-called •' return to nature,' which finds its 
fullest expression in the poetry at the beginning 
of the nineteenth, begins to show itself in non- 
metrical tales like '• Gulliver," " Crusoe," and 
■• Rassela.s " — all founde<l on the literature of 
travel — far earlier than in eighteenth century 
verse. 

Were there space, we ought to notice, too, 
the literary relations of the age of Cowper, 
Coleridge, Southey, and Wordsworth, with the 
class of writings to which Dampier's belong : 
for example, the use to which Wordsworth, in 
a later version of " The Blind Highland Boy," 
put the anecdote told by Dampier about the 
little son of Captain Rocky, who went aboard 
his father's ship in an inunense tortoise-sheU. 
But we must close rather with a glance at our 
own day. 

What has lately occa-sioned the reissue of so 
many half -forgotten lxK)ks of travel and explo- 
ration ? In part, of course, the activity displayed 
in reviving such works is artificial, stimulated 
by enterprising publishers, and answering to the 
factitious needs of emidous libraries. In part, 
also, the interest is scholarly : volumes like these 
of Mr. Masefield, or the Hakluyt Society's 
reprint of " Purchas his Pilgrims," or Dr. 
Thwaites's series of " Early Western Travels." 
meet the demaj^ds of the historian and the 
geographer for acee.ssible works of reference, 
where, to the isolate<l investigator, the original 
editions may be wholly out of reach. But the 
rapidity with which obsolete itineraries have 
been republished within the last decade or s 
seems to argue something more noteworthy than 
a mere inflation of the book market, something 
more important, even, than the satisfaction of 
.scholars. It seems to argue a wider popular 
interest in at least one side of past hnman ex- 
perience, at a time when experience, if it is to 
gain a hearing, must not in general be verj' old. 

The }x)pidarization of Dampier in his own age 
precede! " Robinson Crusoe " and "Gulliver." 
The resurrection of Dampier and innumerable 
other travellei-s, that took place a century or 
more ago, was a potent influence in the revi\-al 
of honest observation and true poetry under 
Wordsworth. Can it be that the present vigor 
shown by editors like Mr. Masefield will, 1)y 
teaching us again to see the external world as 
it is, unlock the sources of our now languisliing 
poetry? Lane Cooper.

KVOLUTION AND THK ORIGIN Ol' JjIFK.* 

The past ten years have witnessetl a remark- 
able development in the science of biology, and 
especially in that jwrtion of it which has to do 
with the problem of organic evolution. The 
trend of biological work as a whole has in this 
period taken a sliarji turn away from the path 
it had previously been following. Formerly, 
the orthoilox and prevailing metho<l of studying 
the problem of life was the truly oriental one of 
fii-st caref idly killing the creature to be studied 
and then with infinite pains proceeding to scru- 
tinize its minute structure. Having acquired 
some data on this point, it was obviously a 
simple and not impleasant process to spm out 
theories as to the significance for the life of the 
individual or the species of all the structiu-al 
peculiarities found. Applying certain general 
ndes (carefidly compiled in Haeckel's "Gen- 
ei-elle Morphologic ") to the conduct of this 
pleasant game, it was jjossible, in the period 
between the appearance of the "Origin of 
Species" and say 1896, to build up an im- 
|)osing mass of litemture regarding the genetic 
relationships of animals. Toward the end of 
this period, however, the feeling began to become 
widespread that no substantial gain in our know- 
le<lge of how organic evolution actually takes 
platie had been made by the method of attack- 
ing the problem which had been in vogue. 
Many investigators began to wonder whether 
a somewhat less mdirect mode of research — 
(me which should deal with living organisms, 
and treat evolution as a process — might not 
reasonably be expected to advance knowledge 
rather more mpidly. As a result of this 
change of view-point, we have seen in the last 
decade a swing of the pendulum of biological 
investigation away from the so-called " pure " 
morphology over to the experimental side of 
the subject. The i-esults, even in so short a 
period as a decade, have been remarkable. 
To mention only some of those which have 
hatl to do directly with the problem of evol-

ution, we have fii-st in importance the won- 
derfid experiments of De Vries, in which the 
actual origin of new elementary species has 
been directly observed. Closely related to this 
work on mutation lias lieen the accunuda- 
tion of residts carrying us toward a precise 
knowledge of perhaps the most fundamental of 
biological processes, — namely, hei-edity. Start- 
ing in 1897 ^vith the publication, by Karl 
Pearson, the English mathematician-biologist, 
of exact determinations of the intensity of 
inheritance in given cases, and receiving a fresh 
impetus in 1900 with the "rediscovery" of 
Mendel's laws of alternative inheritance, there 
has been a triUy remarkable advance of knowl- 
edge in this field. 

Not only has the change of biological view- 
point to which we have alluded stimulated 
investigatoi-s to unprecedented activity in the 
study of evolution, but also, as usually happens 
in such cases, it has led to the production of a 
whole series of " popidar " books on evolution 
and related topics. It is with a few of this 
season's product of these less technical exposi- 
tions of the present trend of biological thought 
that we liave to do here. On the basi.s of 
subject-matter, we may divide the.se books intt) 
two groups. The fu-st group, dealing with 
organic evolution in the usually accepted sense, 
includes Guenther's " Darwinism and the Prob- 
lems of Life," Lock's "Recent Progress," 
Heatlley's " Life and Evolution," and Jordan 
and Kellogg's " Evolution and Animal Life " : 
the second gi'oup, dealing with the more recon- 
dite problem of that which precedes organic? 
evolution, the origin of life itself, includes Le 
Dantec's "Origin of Life" and Bastian's 
" Evolution of Life." Taken as a whole, this 
array of titles is imposing. Do the contents 
fulfil the promise of the titles of the volumes? 
In the preface of the first book on our list, 
" Darwinism and the Problejns of Life," Pro- 
fessor Guenther tells us that " The present work 
had its origin in an attempt to appreciate the 
range, the foundation, and the value of evo- 
lutionary theories." As the result of this 
" attempt," the author comes to the conclusion 
that on the whole the only theories of evolution 
worthy of credence are those of his academical 
colleague, Weismann. All the recent experi- 
mental work of De Vries and others on evolution 
has for liim no special significance so far as the 
fimdamentals are concerned. In no doubtful 
terms does he express his opinion of deviations 
from the orthodox Weismaimian creed. Thus, 
regarding the mutation theory he says (p. 347): 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



209 



" Hence the multiplicity of our actual species 
cannot be due to mutations." This ought to 
be final. The theory of orthogenesis — diat 
definitely directed variations occur in nature, 
and are an important factor in progressive evo- 
luticm — receives no kinder treatment, though 
in the last few years much definite experimental 
eNntlence in its favor ha-s appeared. Taken a.s 
a whole, that portion of Dr. Guenthers book 
which deals strictly with biology c-an Ijest be 
characterized as sadly behind the times. It 
iloes not ^ve a truthful picture of current sci- 
entific opinion regarding the problem of organic 
evolution. The last two chapters deal with the 
broad philosophic aspects of evolution. The 
author's standpoint is one of curiously mangled 
idealism. Dinge an »ich are all about us, but 
•• natural science does not present reality to us 
as it is.'' Reality is " infinite " and '• incom- 
prehensible." A considerable portion of the 
final chapter deals \%'ith ethical questions. The 
best that the author can offer us here is : " The 
utmost that science can say is that an ethic, 
a setting-up of ends to be attained, has no 
meaning. It can only direct a man to let him- 
.self be borne in peace on the stream of cause 
and effect, without doing anything, because his 
action could have no aim and no residt. The 
only possible scientific ethic is resignation." 
All this would be amusins. were it not for the 
possibility that someone might take it as an 
authoritative statement of the real standpoint 
of science. 

If Professor Guenther's book is l>ehind the 
times, certainly the same cannot be said of Mr. 
Lock's account of " Rec-ent Progress in the 
Study of Variation. Heredity-, and Evolution." 
the second work on our list. This is strictly 
up to date, — so much so, ind^ied, as to run a 
little risk of being labeled " frenzied biology." 
and as to have verj' t^rtainly only an ephemeral 
\-alue. The author has been actively engaged 
in the study of Mendel's laws of heredity in 
plants, and the present book is plainly to be 
regarded as an outlet for the enthusiasm thus 
engendered for the newest in biolt^. After 
a brief and rather perfunctory outline of the 
Darwinian theory- of the method of organic evo- 
lution, in which nothing new is contributed, the 
author proceeds to give a clear and very readable 
summary of (a) recent work in biometry (the 
application of quantitative methods to the study 
of evolution problems), (i) the work of De Vries 
on mutations, and (<•) the investigations of alter- 
native mheritance inspired by the rediscoverj- 
of Mendel's laws. On the whole, this is prob- 



ably the best a>-ailable book from which the 
layman may get a rea-onably complete and non- 
technical account of recent investigations in the 
last two of the three fields covered. Unfor- 
tunately, the treatment of the subjects is not 
strictly even and impartial. All three of them 
are more or less subjects of OMitroversy. and 
especially bitter has been the c<mtrover8y 
between the workers in biometry on the one 
hand and in Mendelism on the other hand. 
Mr. L/ock happ^is to be a ver^' enthusiastic 
Mendelist. as has l>een said ; consequently it 
has resulted that the treatment of biometrical 
work given in the book is very adversely critical, 
while the treatment of Mendelism is altogether 
uncritical. Lea^Tug out this rather serious 
defect, the book has much to recommend it. 

ilr. Headley's "• Life and Evolution " is an 
expansion of a series of lectures on general 
biology to an audience entirely untrained in 
this sci^ice. The aim of the lectures and ai 
the book is to give the clearest possible account 
of some of the main types of structural and 
psychic diversity found in animals, together 
with an exposition of current views as to how 
these various types came into existence in the 
course of organic evolution. Everyone will 
grant that this is a most laudable purpose, and, 
further, that if the task is well done the result 
will stand as a notable contribution to popular 
biological literature. It may be said at aooe 
that ]^Ir. Headley has done very well indeed 
what he set out to do in this book. In the 
reviewer's opinion, there exists no other book 
which in the field tovered can ccMupare in gen- 
eral excellence with this. Everywhere free of 
technicalities, simple without being siUy, never 
shirking the difficult and abstruse problems of 
biology but rather elucidating the best of 
present-day opinions regarding them, the author 
has told and illustrated the general outlines of 
the story of the evolution of animals in a mas- 
terly \»-ay. The keynote of the bo(^ is the con- 
sideration of the structures. of animals from the 
point of view of adaptation. This is good ; and 
the «^y the point is worked out in the book is 
better. The procedure here is not that so com- 
mon in popidar works on evolution, of discussing 
adaptation as an abstract proposition and then 
illustrating it with a few stock examples which 
have been overworked to the point of exhaustion. 
Instead, our author takes a series of ob\4ous 
structures of common animals and shows spe- 
cifically how these structures individually are of 
a character to help the possessor in its struggle 
for existence under the conditions in which it 



210

finds itself. Thus, for example, it is brought 
out \vith gi-eat clearness how those stnictural 
characteristics, both superficial and skeletal, 
which differentiate a bird from a reptile are 
adaptations to avian conditions of existence. 
This leads naturally to a discussion of the flight 
of birds, and the jjroblem of flight in general. 
In this field the author is able, from his long 
exjjerience in bird study, to speak with unique 
authority, and his discussion is one which may 
be read even by the specialist with profit as well 
as plea-sure. 

While primarily a book for the '• general 
reader," the volume entitled " Life and Evo- 
lution" will, unless we are greatly mistaken, l)e 
warmly welcomed by the teachers of nature- 
study in the secondary and normal schools. It 
will prove a mine of information and suggestion 
for them. The book is copiously and (imfor- 
tunately) unevenly illusti-ated. Some of the 
original photographs are excellent, while the 
line-drawings in some instances are so crude 
as greatly to mar the appearance of an other- 
wise well-made book. The captious critic who 
searches for minute errors will find some, but 
they are so relatively few in number and so 
clearly the outcome of the " popidar lecture " 
method of presentation as haixUy to call for men- 
tion in view of the general excellence of the work 
as a whole. 

Dr. Jordan and Professor KeUogg's " Evo- 
lution and Animal Life " is, like Mr. Headley's 
book, the outgrowth of a course of popular 
lectures on evolution, with the difference that 
in the present case the lectures were delivered 
to an audience of imiversity students. On the 
whole, it must be said that the x-esult of the 
transcription of lectures into book form is not so 
happy in the case of the American as in the case 
of the English book, probably on account of the 
very fact of the difference in the audiences in 
the two instances. There is an unmistakeable 
and insistent didactic flavor to " Evolution and 
Animal Life," which never allows the rea<ler 
to forget that the aim of tliis \vriting is to 
teach undergraduate students as much as may 
be about organic evolution. The scope of the 
work is more extensive, and the treatment of 
the whoR subject of evolution more thorough 
(in a pedagogical sense) m this than in any of 
the other books on our list. This may be indi- 
cated by a summary statement of the contents. 
The first three chaptei-s are occupied with pre- 
liminary definitions of evolution and discussions 
of the physical basis of life, the simplest forms 
of life, the meaning of species, and similar fun- 



damental points. The next eight chapters deal 
with the various theories as to the method of 
evolution which have been proposed, and the 
facts and supjwsed facts of nature on which they 
have been based. The remaining ten chapters 
are devoted to special topics related to the 
subject of evolution. They include discussions 
of such matters as sex, ontogenetic development, 
paleontology, geogi-aphical distribution, para- 
sitism, adaptations, communal life of animals, 
coloration, psychic life of animals, and " man's 
pla^-e in nature." The treatment of these topics 
follows fairly closely the conventional lines 
which have become i-ather definitely established 
in the univei'sity teaching of evolution in this 
country, but introduces much of the most recent 
work which has been done in the field covered. 
It hardly needs saying in an American journal 
that the book is well written, authoritative, and 
suggestive. It would be difficult, if not impos- 
sible, to find a better work to put in the hands 
of serious students of evolution, to be used 
either as a text-book or for so-called " collateral 
reading." 

The two books in our second division, the 
oi'igin of life, require but brief discussion. 
Le Dan tec's contribution is a volume of two 
hmidi-ed and fifty pages, which, according to the 
title, ha.s to do with the •' Nature and Origin of 
Life." Regarding the " nature of life," the 
author assui-es us at great length that life is a 
mechanism. The " proof " of this is rather de- 
vious, but essentially appears to depend as a 
foundation oil the fact that living protoplasm is 
matter in the colloidal state of iiggregation. The 
superstructure of the proof consists of a redis- 
cussion of the elementary known facts of biology 
in a mathematical terminology, which for logi- 
cal imperativeness compares not imfavorably 
with the old doggerel, — 

" If A is a tiirilip. 
And B is a flea, 
Then C equals tweedle- 
Duindee.'' 

The discussion of the " origin of life " is under- 
taken on the two hmidred and forty-eighth page. 
On the two himdi-ed and fiftieth (and last") 
page, the author tells us that " The problem of 
protoplasm synthesis remains what it was." 
Nothing coiUd be more cei'tain than this, so far 
BS any contribution by Le Dantec is. con- 
cerned. 

Dr. Ba-stian's most recent contribution, the last 
book of our list, is mainly of historical interest. 
It is a detailed and somewhat belated state- 
ment of his side of the controversy over the .spon-

taneous generation of life, which followed the 
publication, in 1872. of his book on " The Be- 
ginnings of Life." Ill this it was maintained that 
the origination of li\Tng things from non-living 
matter could readily be observed experimentally. 
Tliis thesLs was immediately attacked by one of 
the greatest figures in the history of biological 
science, Pastern-, and by a master of physical 
science, T\Tidall. It was. and has remained, the 
verdict of the world that the exjieriments of these 
two men successfully and fLnall}' refuted Dr. 
Bastian's thesis. After more than thirty years' 
work and thought on the subject, he is. however, 
more than ever conN-inced that he is right and 
that everj'body else is wrong on this ob^-iously 
important question. Unfortunately, it is greatly 
to be doubted whether the present book will win 
anyone to his position. Ingenious and striking 
some of the new experiments citetl certainly are : 
but it will be very difficult to find any biologist 
who will be convinced that they deinoiDttrate the 
truth of the conclusion drawn from them by Dr. 
^"^tian. Raymond Pearl.

It is a commonplace observation in science, that 
as knowledge advances there is a corresponding 
change in the scientific vocabulary. In the science 
of transportation there is, consequently, a change in 
the language. The old poetic glamor which hangs 
about the terms associate<l with the old modes of 
travel — the palanquin, the se<lan chair, the post- 
chaise, and the stage-coach, linked with their com- i 
panion terms, the old North Road, the tavern, the 
great roast and the rtagon — is no longer ours. 
Long ago we lost the beautiful significance of 
" sauntering," " sojourning." " wandering." '• pil- ] 
grimage." and even of so modem a term as " a ' 
walking tour." To-day Kipling sings of the beauty 
of the " liner " and the glorj- of a locomotive, and 
Maeterlinck pays a fervid tribute to the "'wonderful ; 
unknown beast," the automobile. -Both these writers 
are artists in fine feelings, with a sensitive regard 
for fine language ; but the average reader, when he | 
thinks of the glory of motion, reverts to De Quin- ' 
cey's account of the English Slail-Coach. to 
Stevenson's " Inland Voyage " and " Travels Arith a 
Donkey." to Hazlitt. and to Borrow, and wonders if

modern transportatioo, with its cry for speed, will 
satisfy his demand for the poetry of travel as did 
these masters. 

Mr. Francis Miltoun, in his book entitled "The 
Automobilist Abroad." well says that " A certain 
picturesqueness of travel may be wanting when 
comparing the automobile with the whirling coacb- 
and-four of other days, but there is vastly more 
comfort for all concerned, and no one will regret 
the march of progress when he considers that noth- 
ing but the means of transportation has changed. 
The delightful prospects of hill and vale are still 
there, the long stretches of silent road, and, in 
France and Germany, great forest routes which are 
as wild and unbroken, except for the magnificent 
surface of the roads, as they were when mediaeval 
travellers startled the deer and the wild boar." The 
poetrj- of motion has a new sensation in its cata- 
logue of virid impressions. Mr. Miltoim's enthusi- 
asm for the motor-car, however, does not overbalance 
the practical and practicable problems of touring 
abroad. Every point of such a tour — hotels, routes, 
road-building, the touring clubs, road-signs, motor- 
car regulations, and customs duties in Europe, maps 
and road-books, famous European road-races, and 
famous hUl climbs — is adequately and interestingly 
recounted by the author of this book, who has toured 
man}- thousands of miles on the Continent and in 
Great Britain, and who, if we count the items in his 
index of places, has visited over six himdred towns 
and cities in Europe. As the average motorist 
develops a marvellous appetite, the author gives 
much space to the question of inns and hotels ; and 
having both suffered and rejoiced in many places ^ 
of entertainment, he speaks with authority and with 
distinct feeling regarding the good and inferior inns 
one meets while motoring. Concerning the roads 
travelled, he' places France as the land par exed- 
lenee for touring. After France comes Great 
Britain, with snug littie touring grounds and excel- 
lent roads. Germany, where touring is in high 
favor, has all sorts and conditions of roads, from 
the best in Baden, the Palitinate and the Grand 
Duchy of Hesse, to poor in the central and northern 
prorinces. Swiss roads are thoroughly good every- 
where, but many of them, partictilarly mountain- 
roads, are closed to automobile traffic In Belgium 
there are immeasurable stretches of the vilest pave- 
ment in the world. Italian roads are variable, but 
generally good on the main lines of travel. Auto- 
uiobiling in Spain is a thing of the future. With 
characteristic humor, Mr. Miltoun discountenances 
the disarmament of European nations, as the rival 
nations are inclined to keep their frontier roads in 
unusually good condition. The grand tour of other 
days has become, in the parlance of the European 
motorist, the " Circuit Europ^n." Beginning at 
Paris, the tourist descends through Poitou to Biarritz, 
thence along the French slope of the Pyrenees, 
skirting the Mediterranean coast by Marseilles and 
Monte Carlo, thence to Genoa, north to Milan and

to Vienna (the outpost for automobile supplies and 
comforts), and returns to Paris by way of Prague, 
Breslau, Berlin, Hanover, Cologne, and Reims. 
This route is about thirty-one hundred miles long, 
and requires from twenty-five to thirty days to make 
the run. Much of the route is more extensively 
used by motorists tlian any other route in Europe. 
Such a tour, Mr. Miltoun assures us, " in all its 
illuminating variety is far and away ahead of the 
benefits our forefathers derived from the box-seat 
of a diligence or a post-chaise." 

The four '' parts " of Mrs. Grace Gallatin Seton's 
book bearing the title " Ninirod's Wife " narrate the 
adventures, both gi-ave and gay, of herself and hus- 
band, with their companions, in tlie Sierras, the 
Rockies, on the Ottawa, and in Noi-way. In a 
prefatory note Mrs. Seton says : " The events herein 
recorded really liajjpened, although some latitude 
has been taken as to time and place; and one 
experience may seem to follow fast upon another, 
because, necessarily, the best of all lias been omitted 
— the glorious succession of eventless days when 
one was content to be alive and care-free." This 
happily-phrased note disarms the critic, who other- 
wise might question the plausible rapid-fire incidents 
which occur in breathless succession. To read of 
Mrs. Seton's adventures in the Sierras, where she 
began her outing by making a burlesque plunge 
into an icy-cold pool whose only other occupant was a 
writhing water-snake, and then to visit a hut with 
a frantic woman whose husband lay dead there, to 
have an exciting time with a Mexican sheej>herder 
whose ill-treated dog had wisely followed the author's 
• party (the dog which ultimately saved the party fi-om 
a Juggernaut-like assault from a bull ) down to the 
account of a tiny field-mouse whose efforts to escape 
from the heavy canvass on which the rubber bed 
rested caused the author to imagine and to suffer the 
thought that the sneaking insinuating motion was 
made by a rattlesnake, — to read of all these inci- 
dents is to know that Mrs. Seton's preface was war- 
ranted, and, indeed, necessary. " In the Rockies " 
contains an interesting account of a ride through a 
burning forest — - and it occun-ed on the Fourth of 
July I Another chapter in the same part tells about 
a fantastic Fantail Ghost and a Jack Rabbit Dance, 
both capitally told and charmingly illustrated. " On 
the Ottawa " contains a good story of the author's 
fishing for the muscallonge. Her adventures in 
Norway were confined to kodak-lmnting for rein- 
deer. Whatever mental reservations we may make 
regarding the quick succession of adventures of Mi-s. 
Seton, we can unreservedly praise her for her quick 
wit and catching humor, for her thorough-going 
sportsman-like manner, and for the literary graces 
of good composition. The illustrations, too, made by 
Mr. Walter King Stone and the author's husband, 
Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, are in pleasing har- 
mony with the spirit and the purpose of the book. 

A story goes that Mr. F. C. Selous, the famous 
English hunter of big game, was nicknamed 



" Zealous " by his companions at Rugby. Whether 
true or not, the title is nevertheless a fitting one for 
the man who so zealously hunts all wild things, 
from the nests and eggs of tlie nut-cracker in Bosnia 
to the game giants of Africa and of British North 
America. It is now a goodly number of years since 
Mr. Selous went out to Africa, to make his living 
with gun and rifle, and to write entertaining books 
of adventure on that paradise of big-game hunters. 
In recent years — since about 1900 — Mr. Selous 
has limited his expeditions largely to British North 
America, in Central Canada, Newfoundland, and the 
Yukon Country, where he has lumted for specimens 
of fine heads of the moose, caribou, and wild sheep. 
His latest book, " Recent Hunting Trips in Britisli 
North America," .is made up of transcripts from 
his diaries which were written nightly over the 
camp-fire. One would very naturally expect that 
such trips woidd fairly bristle with thrilling adven- 
tures ; but such is not the manner of Mr. Selous's 
narrative, nor is his method of liunting big game of 
such a nature that it invites a breath-holding nar- 
rative. Mr. Selous's 2)repai'ations for his hunts are 
so orderly, his stalking is so business-like, and his 
results are generally so workmanlike, that the reader 
will often pause to wonder wliere the sport conies 
in. But Mr. Selous is not a parlor sportsman, nor 
is lie a believer in batteau hunting — a form of 
hunting in high favor in Newfoundland, where tlie 
caribou are shot in hundreds from ambush in tlieir 
semi-annui^l migi-ations across the land. Rather, 
he prefers to take a canoe, a guide, and some neces- 
saries, penetrate the game-haunted forests far from 
the beaten paths of wanton skin-hunters, and there 
select and kill a few old male animals with good 
heads wliicli will serve as mementoes and specimens. 
To kill the female, unless for food supjily, meets his 
disapproval. That the author can let game go 
unmolested, is shown by this story of a caribou doe 
and fawn : 

■■ Wlien I first saw the deer thev were about one hundred 
and fifty yai'ds away ; and as the wind was blowing down- 
stream they uouhl not possibly scent me, so I sat down on a 
rock and waited for them. They came slowly along, picking 
their way amongst the stones. ... I sat in fiUl view, about 
midway between the bank and the water, holding my rifle 
across my knees, and remained absolutely motionless. 

■■ The doe never noticed me at all, and I am sure never 
for one moment imagined that I was not a part of the stone 
on which I was .sitting. She passed slowly between me .and 
the bank, and at one time was certjiiuly not four feet away 
from me. The fawn walked right onto me, and when its 
nose was almost touching my knees, must have smelt me, as 
it stopped, and stood looking into ray face with its nostrils 
twitching. I remained perfectly still, and it then turned 
aside, and walking past me rejoined its mother, without, 
however, seeming to have taken alarm." 
Such a pictm'e reveals much — the wonderful con- 
trol of the hunter, the unsuspicious nature of the 
animals, and a golden opportunity for the hunter 
with a kodak. But Mr. Selous is not a kodak 
hunter. He frankly admits that the telling shot 
which bags the game is the sport that appeals to 
him. He does admire the •• poor brute " in his 



1907.]

natural surroundings, but he cannot withhold the 
shot which will add a -'gootl head " — to be measured 
in inches and to be counted in points — to his col- 
lection or to the niuseuTu at South Kensington. 

" Ten thousand years of superficial and unsatisfying civ- 
ilization have not altered the fundamental nature of man, and 
the snccessful hunter of to-day becomes a primeval savage, 
remorseless, triumphant, full of a wild exultant joy, which 
none but those who have lived in the wilderness and de- 
pended upon their success as hunters for their daily food 
can ever know or comprehend." 

Our two quotations reveal, we think, the two sides of 
the author — the nature-lover and the head-hunter. 

The very title of Captain F. C. Dickinson's book, 
" Big Game Shooting on the Equator," leads the 
reader to anticipate some thrilling tales of a<lventure, 
recortls of some remarkable shots, accounts of haii"- 
breadth escapes, and some worthy descriptions of 
natural scenery in ever-wonderful Africa. None 
of these virtues, however, distinctly mark Captain 
Dickinson's volume. Were it not for the excellent 
illustrations, and for the summaries of the game 
regulations of the British East African Protectorate 
and the German East African Protectorate, the book 
would have but little intrinsic value. The author 
does not give a connected story of his hunting expe- 
ditions, nor does he narrate many single adventures 
in following his sport. In brief, the volume is 
largely a note-book of observations on the various 
species of game, their habitat, appeaiance, size, color, 
habits, and head measurements, jotted down in the 
curtest and most uninteresting terms imaginable. 
Should any hunter of big game anticipate a sporting 
pilgrimage to Africa, however. Captain Dickinson's 
book will offer him some additional information on 
the rarer kinds of game in the East African countiy. 

Mrs. Mary Mead Clark, in her book entitled 
"A Corner in India," tells of the missionary work 
of her husband and herself among the natives of the 
Nag^ Hills in Upper Burma. They lived among 
those strange people in the high hills from 1868 to 
1901, at which time Mre. Clark returned to her 
American home with Dr. Clark, who later retui-ned 
to his cliarge. Such a long period of residence in 
that little-known corner of the world would naturally 
bring Mrs. Clark into contact with many interesting 
stories of the home-life of the savages in Burma, of 
their life at work and at play, their worship and 
strange legends, their relationships with neighboring 
villages, and, above all, their slow acceptance of the 
Christian faith offered to them by the zealous mis- 
sionaries. All these divei'sified stories Mrs. Clark 
relates in a simple, unaffected, and pleasing style, 
and her book is consequently of interest both to the 
casual reader who likes to know about strange 
people in remote nooks of the world, and to those 
readers who are vitally concerned about the spread 
of the Christian religion. Unlike many books writ- 
ten by missionaries, this one is illustrated with good 
reproductions of excellent photographs.

Thedev^u,pmr,u '^'oiessor George P. Baker's - De- 
0/ Shaketpeare velopment of Sliakespeare as a 
a> a dramatitt. Dr-amatist " (Macmillan) is a sane 
and well-considered attempt to set forth, somewhat 
more fully than has hitherto been attempted, the 
conditions that governed Shake8i)eare's growth in 
the teclmique of dramatic ai't, and the problems 
which the gi-eat dramatist hatl to meet and solve in 
pursuing his high vocation of dramatic poet while at 
the same time satisfying the eager theatre-goers 
of his day. Professor Baker's expeiience as an 
amateur stage-manager has been usefid to him in 
studying the details of the Elizabethan stage ; and 
his cliapter on this subject throws a good deal of 
light on a subject attended with many difficulties, 
but of gi-eater importance than students of Shake- 
speare's art used to tliink. He rightly emphasizes 
the fact tliat the Elizabethans went to the theatre 
to see and hear a stori/ told ; that Shakespeare, 
therefore, as an ambitious playwright had to make 
it his cliief business to tell a good story well, and 
to meet the gradually shifting demands of a public 
which in a sense may be said to have been growing, 
like himself, though at a great distance, in dramatic 
taste ; and that Shakespeare's plays must be judged 
by the standards of their day and not ours. Bearing 
these facts in mind, we shall worry less over the 
naming of plays like '• Julius Caesar " and " The 
Merchant of Venice," and in general sliall keep a 
point of view from which we shall l)e much better 
able to judge of Tudor dramatic effects and values. 
If the more subtle effects of dramatic situations are 
constantly dwelt upon and emphasized by Professor 
Baker, we are not inclined to quari-el with him 
for this : for whUe it is doubtless true that Sliake- 
speare could not have thought of them all while he 
was writing liis plays, still, who sliall say which of 
these effects he may not liave thought of and which 
he may not liave unconsciously, but instinctively and 
just as surely, prepared for? It may be said that 
very few would feel all or any of these impressions ; 
but this is not the point. If any persons may be 
considered to have felt them, they are not negligible. 
The book tlirows more light on Shakespeare's intel- 
lectual and ailastic development than many others 
wi-itten with less regard for external conditions and 
for the part other playwrights played in preparing 
the way for Shakespeare. The illustrations, repre- 
senting Elizabethan London and the theatres of that 
time, are most valuable. 

An,hoioi,ie.fo,- ^he chief difficulty which confronts 
the stiidetit of the teacher of English literature is 
Engiiih poetry, ^jj^j ^f persuading his students to do 
enough reading to make profitable the use of the 
historical and critical manual with which they are 
provided. If they confine themselves to the text>

objects are concerned, and they get nothing more 
from it than a mass of facts and formulae of slight

educational value, most of which are speedily for- 
gotten. But the reading which they need is not 
easy to procure. Few of them have the books at 
home, and if they are sent to the school library, or 
to the public library, there may be fifty of them 
trying to get the same book at the same time. The 
exceptional student will doubtless contrive, in spite 
of all difficulties, to do a considerable amount of 
collateral reading, but the average student will give 
up the task as too onerous, and miss the main pur- 
pose of his study. Frankly, there seems to be no 
way out of the difficulty save by providing each 
student with an abundant supply of literature for 
his own private use. In the case of poetry, at least, 
this is not an in&uperable difficulty, for enough 
poetry can be got into a single volume to be worth 
while, and, if printed with due economy, the volume 
need be neither bulky nor expensive. Two volumes 
have recently come to us having precisely this object 
in view ; in other words, being intended to be small 
libraries of poetry in themselves. Professor J. M. 
Manly's "English Poetry," published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co., gives us, in double-columned pages, 
something like fifty thousand lines of the best and 
most representative English poetry, ranging all the 
waj' from the " Ormulum " to Mr. Swinburne. 
There are practically no notes, except a few of 
glossarial character, although there is a brief his- 
torical introduction to the collection. The poetical 
drama is necessarily excluded, but all other types 
are represented, and, except ui the case of a few 
very long poems, the examples are given complete. 
The other volume of whicli we now make mention 
is the " English Poems," edited bj' Professor W. C. 
Bronson, and published at the University of Chicago 
Press. This volume, which extends to about twenty 
thousand lines, includes only poets of the nineteenth 
century, as the editor intends to prepare three other 
volumes for the earlier periods. Professor Bronson 
also finds room for about a hundred pages of critical 
and bibliographical notes. These two works, pub- 
lished at a moderate price, should be warmly wel- 
comed as adjuncts to the work of teaching English 
literature in both colleges and secondary schools. 

Volume two of ^he second volume of Bielschow- 
the definitive sky's Life of Goethe (Putnam), 
life of Goethe. translated by Professor William A. 
Cooper of Leland Stanford Junior University, has 
recently appeared. It covers the period from 
Groethe's Italian journey to the War of Liberation, 
1788-1815, comprising the last two chapters of the 
first volume and the first twelve of the second of 
the German edition. Thick paper, clear pi-int, wide 
margins, and the other accessories that belong to 
the making of a fine book have been employed, as 
before, to make an imposing volume. It is, how- 
ever, almost a soiu-ce of regi'et that the publisliers 
have in this way increased the cost of the book. A 
thinner paper of equally good quality would have 
made it possible to retain the two volumes of the 
original. This would certainly have facilitated its 



use for frequent reference, and also it seems some- 
what out of proportion to make a translation not 
only cost practically the same per volume as the 
entire work in the original, but also to increase the 
number of volumes from two to three. The work 
was reviewed at some length in The Dial upon 
the appearance of the first volume of the translation. 
At that time its rank as the best and probably the 
definitive Goethe biography was recognized. It is 
therefore necessary to speak at this time only of the 
technical excellence of the translation. In general 
it seems that here there is a marked improvement ; 
it is very faithful and at the same time the English 
is usually free from the influence of the foreign 
idiom. Occasionally the rendering does not allow 
for the difference in the connotation of the same 
word in the two languages. Thus in speaking of the 
poet's visit to a horse-fair to buy horses, Bielschowsky 
employed the somewhat pedantic expression that 
this belonged " zur menschlichen Physiognomic des 
Olympiers." The thought is that the act in question 
was characteristic of the purely human phase of the 
poet's exalted nature. Whatever may be said of 
the German, the literal rendering, " to the human 
physiognomy of the Olympian," is practically mean- 
ingless. In speaking of " Iphigenie auf Tauris " 
also, the line concluding the great appeal of the 
priestess to the king, " Verdirb uns — wenn du 
darfst," is rendered, " Destroy us — if thou dare." 
This contradicts the very thought of a supreme ap- 
peal to " moral principles." upon which the authoi' 
is commenting. The verb dilrfen almost never 
means dare, and here, as the allusion to divine pro- 
tection shows, the meaning is, '' if thou mayest," or. 
" if it is permitted thee." However, as already 
said, the translation is in general exceedingly good, 
and Professor Cooper deserves the liearty thanks of 
the large number of admirers of Goethe, for whom 
reading the original would have been an appalling 
or an impossible task.

careless world, remain from generation to genera-

lisher turns his attention from the whirling vortex 
of new books, and gives them a fresh outfit ; pre- 
sents them — if he has a generous soul — with the 
clearest of type, the finest of paper, the richest and 
most appropriate of bindings." It is this sort of 
" new outfit " that Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
have provided for the " Familiar Letters." The 
edition is in two volumes, beautifully printed, and 
bound very simply in terra-cotta boards, with leather 
back and label, in a fashion to please the " fortunate

long known and loved the •• Letters," and who will 
be glad to own them in so dignified and snitable a 
dress. Such persons need no introdnction to the 
" Letters," whether critical or biographical ; indeed 
any bnt Miss Repplier's they would find superfluous 
or even intrusive. But Miss Repplier's introduc- 
tions are never superfluous : they re-kindle half- 
forgotten enthusiasms, suggest fresh points of view, 
flash light upon fugitive personalities, show old facts 
with new faces, — put one. in short, in just the right 
mood for either the leLsurely enjoyment of an old 
friend or the delightful discovery- of a new one. 
Out of deference, perliaps. to 3Hiss Repplier's well- 
known antipathy for tlie omnipresent note, the 
" Letters " have been left to speak for themselves, 
and surely no reader will pine for erudite guidance 
through the maze of curioas anecdote, lively narra- 
tive, and characteristically intimate comment and 
reflection which Howell has constmcted, writing 
always crisply and lucidly, in accordance with his 
belief that a letter should be '^ shortrooated and

'• A Theorj- of Pure Design " (Houghton) the con- 
clusions at which he has arrived. The book has been 
long in preparation, and deserves more extended 
comment than can here be given it. It is '' a con- 
tribution to science rather than to art," thoi;^h it 
should prove a manual of decided valae to designers 
who care to go into the raison d'etre of the effects 
for which they strive. Starting out with definitions 
of the orders of harmony, balance, and rhythm, pro- 
gress is by carefully ordered steps, each illustrated 
by diagrams, which, it is perhaps well to explain, 
are not to be considered as designs, their onlv func-

not with designs, but with the basis of all design, 
that he deals. Great pains have been taken with 
the terminology, and everj- statement appears to 
have been weighed and tested with scrupolous care. 
The reasoning is clear and in most respects convinc- 
ing ; it would be entirely so but for a false note at 
the outset, in a definition of harmony which virtually 
makes it synonjTnoxis with unity and takes no note of 
the accordance of correlations. This at once raises

Though Dr. Ross's book is a notable contribution to 
the literature of testhedcs, the last word upon the 
subject Ls not yet said. Nevertheless, what he has 
written is worthy of most thoughtful consideration. 
As he aptly remarks, ''We must not believe that

us only a little way. Let no one believe that with-

That so picturesque a figure as Sir 
John Hawkins should liave remained 
hitherto all bat neglected by bio- 
graphers is remarkable. Short accounts of him we 
do have in certain coUeeted biographies, such as 
Southey's *• Lives of the British Admirals," and in 
; the Transactions of the Devonshire Association, as 
' well a-s in Froude's and other histories of England : 
' but nothing like a detailed biography had appeared 
, until the issue of Mr. K. A. J. Walling's book 
! entitled "A Sea-Dog of Devon" (John Lane Co.). 
■ And even this is not offered as a sufficiently fnil 
story of the famous mariner's adventures, but rather 
as '-a suggestion towaxtl a detailed 'Life.'" An 
Introduction is contributed by Lord Brassey and 
Mr. J<^n Leyland, who assign as one of the 
author's motives in undertaking the work a desire 
•• to vindicate his hero from the charge of having 
inaugurated the British slave trade." The author 
liimself declares that "John Lok, an EnglLshmau. 
A-isiting the West Coast for ivory and gold-dust some 
ten years earlier, is entitled to the honour." But 
that is little to the porpose. Hawkins, as contem- 
poraiy State Papers and other evidence prove, was 
early in tlie field and made himself conspicuous 
there. As a young man he learned " that negroes 
were very good merchandise in Hispauiola, and that 
they might easily be had upon the coast of Guinea." 
The author admits all this, but urges in defense that 
if his hero was not a humanitarian, he lived in an 
unhumanitarian age, and after all there were oUiers 
worse than "he. •' Every aeooont of him," he goes 
so far as to assert. '• makes Hawkins a man of large 
heart and generous sympathies." Yet in " Purchas, 
his Pilgrimage," it is maintained by *•• R. M." (sup- 
posed to be .Sir Robert ManseU), who claims to have 
known Hawkins personally, that "he had malice 
with dissimulation, rudeness in behaviour, and was 
covetous in the last degree." However, a coldly 
impartial bi<^;raphy would not kincQe the reader: 
and Mr. Walling's book is a good, an interesting, 
and a ireful piece of work.

[Oct. 1, 



Professor Raleigh and tlie rest of us have now 
outlived, let us hope, the period of cock-sure detailed 
accounts of Shakespeare's life, in which eveiy hour 
of his earthly existence is accounted for and every 
line of his plays is confidently attributed to him or 
his collaborators or Bacon or someone else. Professor 
Raleigh admits frankly and fearlessly that we do not 
and probably never shall know unich that it would be 
pleasant and desirable to know about Sliakespeare ; 
and then passes on to more important discussions 
of Shakespeare's reading, the theatre for which he 
wrote, and the stories and chai-acters and motives of 
the great plays. He is by no means indifferent to 
the philological problems still awaiting solution, 
and illustrates well the nature of these problems by 
remarks on "The Taming of the Shrew," " Timon," 
and " Troilus and Cressida," which latter he views 
as a political drama based on an earlier play which, 
a.s a love drama, had given place to " Romeo and 
Juliet." Except the chronology of the plays, on 
which Professor Raleigh says very little, there is 
scarcely an important topic of interpretation or 
criticism on which he does not manage to touch and 
to make some sufficiently comprehensive and illu- 
niinating remarks. The book may be characterized 
in short as a suggestive and stimulating discussion 
of the cliief mattei-s that should engage the attention 
of readers and students of the poet. The author 
apparently lias no illusions, and subscribes to no 
" isms." He has jn'oduced a thoroughly safe vol- 
ume on the subject of what everyone should know 
about Shakespeare. If he adds no important fact 
to our meagre store, if he adds no new theory to 
the bewildering maze already baffling the student, 
surely he does much in interpreting for us the times 
in which Shakespeare moved and, perliaps as success- 
fully as most other writei-s, the mental life which 
the poet must have lived. And when we add that 
he writes not as a fetich-woi-shipper but as a reverent 
and honest student, we have said enough. 

It is a very human sort of a book 
"^M:^rie.. i" ^vhich Mrs. Gene Stratton-Porter 

has written " What I Have Done 
with Birds" (Bobbs-Merrill Company). Meadows, 
thickets, swamps, and orchards, along the Wabash, 
have revealed theu- secrets to her persistent search, 
and she has succeeded in a truly remarkable way in 
making friends with the birds at their nests. The 
stories of her successful efforts to photogi'aph the 
parents, the nests, eggs, and young of the native 
birds, are quite as interesting sis are her excellent 
photographs. By dint of great patience, persistent 
care, and what she often modestly calls a lucky 
chance, she has induced many wild and shy birds, 
and not a few unusual ones, to pose before her 
camera, — not only the robin, blue-jay, cow-bird, and 
barn-owl, but also the queen-rail, wood-thrush, black 
vulture, yellow-billed cuckoo, and the belted king- 
fisher.. She takes her readers frankly into her con- 
fidence, and they share her trials and vexations and 
soon come to feel the thrill of eager anticipation 



which attends each new venture in her sport. This 
thread of sustained interest I'uns tlu-ough the whole 
book and makes it possible for the reader to over- 
look a perhaps justifiable pride of the author in her 
achievements and to ignore at times an abrupt style 
and a tendency to employ unusual words and phrases. 
The enthusiasm of her work is contagious and her 
love of the birds deserving of wide emulation.

A new edition, two volumes in one, of Professor 
Gold win Smith's " The United Kingdom : A Political

The " Ohio Historical Series," published by the 
Robert Clarke Co., wliich has been out of print since 
the plates were destroyed by fire several years ago, will

An important forthcoming addition to the Arthur H.

".Seville" and "Spanish Arms and Armour," both

is largely taken from original sources, old newspapers, 
manuscript lettei-s, journals, etc., with aid from descend- 
ants of the men considered, — Francis Uopkiuson, 
Philip Freneau, John Trumbull, Joseph Dennie, William 
Dunlap, and Charles Brockden Brown. 

Volmnes on Mcssi-s. W. S. Gilbert and Beerbohm 
Tree have been added to the " Stars of the Stage " 
series of biographies. They are written, re sjjectively, 
by Miss Edith A. Browne and Mrs. George Cran. A 
volume on Alfred Bnuieaii, by Mr. Arthur Hervey, 
aj)pears in the companion series of " Living Masters of 
Music." The John Lane Co. publisli all three of these 
books. 

The continued popularity of the pocket edition of the 
Wormeley translation of Balzac's " Comedie Huinaine " 
which Messrs. Little, Browni, & Co. issued a few yeai-s 
ago, has led this house to bring out similar pocket 
editions of the masterpieces of Dumas, in fourteen 
volumes, the novels of Jane Austen, in six volumes, to 
be followed a month later by the masterpieces of Victor 
Hugo, in ten volumes. 

Mr. Benson's new book " The Altar Fire," which the 
. Messrs. Putnam will issue at once, is described an being 
written in " the form of a diaiy, and might either be 
called fictitious narrative tliat threatens continually to 
become a series of coimected essays, or of essays on the 
point of turning into a tranquil introspective narration 
that needs no complication of plot to hold firmly the 
reader's attention." 

An important biography is just aiuiounced for publi- 
cation by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. this autumn 
in " Augustus St. Gaudens: A Memorial " by Mr. Royal 
Cortissoz. This handsome volume will contain a memoir 
of the great .sculptor and a study of his work by a dis- 
tinguished art critic who was his intimate friend. It 
«t11 l)e illustrated with fine photogravure reprotluctions 
of St. Gaudens's work. 

A series of historical volumes under the general 
editorship of Professor George Lincoln Burr of Cornell 
University is announced by the Century Co. There 
will be ten volumes in all, each by a specialist in the 
field of which he writes, but all working together to 
secure unity. It is designed that the series, when com- 
pleted, form a historv' of the world from the viewpoint 
of modem scholarship, upon lines essentially new. 

Six new volumes in the Messrs. Crowell's " Handy 
Volume Classics " give us the following titles: Long's 
translation of Marcus Aiirelius; Thoreau's " Cape Cod," 
with an introduction by Mrs. Aiuiie Russell Marble; 
Browne's "Religio Medici," with an introductiou bv 
Professor C. H. Herford: Mr. Henry Drummond's 
"Natural Law^ in the Spiritual World"; the "Little 
Plowers " of St. Francis, edited by Mr. A. G. Ferrei-s 
Howell; and "The Best American Tales," cho.sen by 
Professors W. P. Trent and J. B. Henneman. 

Exclusive rights to the American market for " The 
King's Classics " have been secured by Messrs. John 
W^. Luce & Co., and they are issuing this month imder 
their imprint thirty-five titles. The general aim has 
been to furnish, at a low price, thoroughly edited and 
choicely-printed editions of many notible masterpieces 
of literature which liave not heretofore been easily 
accessible, or of which no satisfactorj- English transla- 
tions have been made. The series is under the general 
editorship of Professor Israel Gollancz, Litt.D., while 
each volume Ls edited by a scholar of distinction. Forty- 
five additional titles aie in preparation. 



The new " Oxford and Cambridge Review " is a very 
different affair from the little periodical venture put forth 
from the two imiversities fifty years ago It is strietlj- 
academic ui its demeanor, and an almost portentous 
.seriousness characterizes the contents. These include 
a trmiraille from the papers of Jqlm Stuart MiU — a 
hitherto unpublished essay " On Social Freedom." There 
are also interesting contributions by Messrs. A. C. 
Benson, A. "W. Verrall, and Ernest Gardner. Religion, 
politics, and athletics are discussed. The Review is to 
have three issues a year — one for each college term. 
It is no less dignified in appearance than in matter. 

Tlie new edition of Tourgu^nieff's novels and short 
stories, in Miss Isabel Hapgood's translation, is at last 
complete in fourteen volumes. The six volumes now 
sent us by the Messrs. Scribner have the following 
titles: "First Love," "Diary of a Superfluous Man," 
" Tl»e Brigadiers," " Spring Freshets," " Phantoms," 
and "A Reckless Character." Each of these titles, of 
course, merely indicates one of a group of stories 
included in the volume. Even more significant than 
some of the stories thus named are such others as 
" Mumii," " Piinin and Baburin," " Asya," and " Faust." 
He who does not know these gems is not more than 
half acquainted with their author. One of the volumes 
also gives us the exquisite " Poems in Prose." 

The Gypsy Lore Society, which led an honorable 
existence in England during the four years of 1888-92, 
has been revii-ed imder the presidency of Mr. David 
MacRitchie, its original founder, and the first nmnber 
of the new series of its quarterly journal has just been 
issued. Articles by Professor John Sampson and the 
late Charles Godfrey Leiaiid appear in this first issue, 
and there are some nine or ten other contributions, all 
of the greatest interest to lovers of Gypsy lore. We 
trust there are many in this country who will aid in this 
valuable work by sending their applications for mem- 
bership, together with the annual dues of one pound 
sterling, to the Secretary of the Society, at 6 Hope 
Place, Liverpool.

THIS MONTH'S 
MAGAZINES 

A Word to Librarians: 

Every librarian is constantly 
being asked questions like 
this about current periodicals: 
"What new magazine is that 
article about in ?" 

The only index that supplies this 
kind of information is WHAT'S 
IN THE MAGAZINES. 

Your regular periodical index, un- 
equalled as it is for general refer- 
ence, is necessarily three or four 
weeks behind time. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

for October (for instance) comes 
out when the October magazines

WITH WORDSWORTH 
IN ENGLAND 

Being a selection of the Poems and Letters of WILLIAM WORDSWORTH 
Which have to do with English Scenery and English Life 

Selected and Arranged By AXXA BEXXESOX McMAHAX 
Editor of ' 'Florence in the Poetry of the Bromtingt, " etc. 

IT is now twenty years since Wordsworth's principal editor and biographer, Pro- 
fessor Knight, suggested that "a volume of selections limited to those which allude 
to localities in the Lake Country, containing fift}' to one hundred illustrations.would 
jje found to cast an unexpected flood of light upon the whole district, and the poet's work 
in connection with it." No such volume has, until the present vear, been offered, and it 
is the aim of "With Wordsworth in England" to cover this fertile and brilliant subject. 

Yearly the number increases of those who recognize Wordsworth is the Great Teacher of the nine- 
teenth century. To interpret, and to pass on his message became his life-work It Is time this genera- 
tion should begin to take a truer view of the human tide of the poet; for it was Nature, in it« largest 
meaning, that was Wordsworth's great inspirer. 

This volume really serves two distinctively valuable purposes: It reveals the real Wordsworth, 
the poet, the naturalist, the man, in those poems which have made him famous; it serves as a guide 
to some of Wordsworth's well-beloved haunts, and suggests the fiavored spots where, at some happy 
moment, the reader may, perchance, attain to the same visions which the poet himself saw: and 
besides it forms an exceptionally beautiful gift-book. 

A beautifully printed, compact volume of 352 pages, 
with 60 choice full-page illustrations from photographs.

A study of Keats. Shelley. Byron, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Landor, Browning. Tennyson, Arnold. 
Rossetti, Morris, and Swinbnme. having for its purpose the discussion of their relation to the world of 
thought and action. Although their personal and artistic qualities are by no means ignored, the chief 
aim of the book is to set forth their outlook upon life rather than their strictly literary achievement. 
This plan makes of the book something quite different from literary criticism in the ordinary sense, and 
causes it to appeal to a much wider range of interests. The treatment is popular rather than scholarly. 
The work is enriched by many quotations, both from the poets themselves and from those who have 
written about them with the clearest understanding and the deepest sympathy.

considerable degree of unity both of time and purpose. All but one have been written 
within very little more than a year ; and in several cases, as will be readily seen, one has

THE FORMATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. 
By George Hooper Ferris. D.D. l6mo. Price, 00 cents 
net. postpaid. 

Mr. Ferris tell us in his preface 
that this work is the result of pro- 
loDKed investigation and study. 
When a student his attention was 
called to the formation of the 
Canon, and from that time to this 
he has been seeting to get as far as 
possible at the facts underlying its 
formation. 

Mr. Ferris's book will create dis- 
cussion. It will be seen, however, 
that he does not deal with theories, 
but that he discusses facts. In the 
presence of a fact we are all of us 
compelled to listen and be respectful.

As a study of Buddhism in comparison with Chiistianity, 
this work will be of value. According to Dr. Gushing 
Buddhism is not in the strict sense of the term a religion. 
Neither God nor sin nor salvation is recognized therein. 
As contrasted with Christianity, it is a system of gloom 
and hopelessness and tinal despair.

Lexicon to the English Poetical Works of John Milton 

By LAURA E. LOCKWOOD, Ph.D., Yale: Associate Professor of the English Language in Wellesley College. 
The book is much more than a valuable, even an essential, aid to students of Milton's Poems ; it contains much of 
very great interest to all who find pleasure in tracing the currents of our fluid English language — the differences 
between Milton's use of certain words and our own — and the influences which have produced these changes.

A NEW DRA MATI C VENTURE. 

About twenty miles north of Chicago, on the 
shore of Lake Michigan, there is a place of 
recreation known as Ra\'inia Park. It is con- 
ducted, like many other amusement parks in 
the neighborhood of our larger cities, by one of 
those electric railway companies that link city 
and suburbs, and that find their accoimt in the 
enterprise le.ss in the gate receipts than in 
the increased profits from the transportation of 
passengers. With this fact the resemblance 
ends. The ordinary park established under such 
conditions is a place of garish lights and catch- 
penny devices, appealing frankly to vidgar 
tastes and empty intelligences, and wise in its 
generation with the wisdom that is at heart 
fooli.shness. Ravdnia Park makes no such appeal 
to the crowd. Chaste in its appointments, both 
as regards architecture and lajidscape garden- 
ing, refined in its atmosphere and a!\l its asso- 
ciations, it embodies a standard of taste that 
makes it conspicuous among similar resorts, if 
not absolutely imique in its distinction. Its 
casino, its theatre, and its concert pavilion rep- 
resent about all that could be desired in com- 
fort and aesthetic satisfaction, and its sylvan 
shades offer a grateful retreat from the summer 
dust and heat of the city near at hand. 

Dui-ing the out-door seasons of the past three 
years, this park has offered concerts of good 
music, twice daily, given by two of the best 
orchestras in America. It has also been the 
scene of charming woodland performances of 
Shakespearian plays, and of a number of .special 
festivals. Even during the winter it is at times 
available, and many entertainments of a high 
character — concerts, plays, and travel-lectures 
— are given in the pretty theatre. Perhaps the 
most interesting experiment of which it has 
been the scene is that of the company of play- 
ers headed by Mr. Donald Robertson, who have 
recently completed a five weeks' season of per- 
formances, and whose work has impelled us to 
the writing of the present article. 

Mr. Robertson's enterprise has been long in 
preparation, and had nearly reached the point 
of disclosure a year ago, when the wind was cap- 
tured from its sails for a time by the ill-starred 
and mismanaged venture which took to itself the 
name of the New Theatre, had a meteoric exist- 



238

ence of some four months, and then collapsed for 
lack of support. Its intentions were of the best, 
but a theatrical undertaking based upon good 
intentions alone is not likely to secure a footing 
anywhere in this commercial age and country. 
We recorded the demise of the New Theatre last 
winter, and explained the reasons why its failure 
hatl been assured from the start. We also stated 
that the cause of the literary theatre in Chicago 
was by no means lost, and that another year 
would probably witness a new experiment upon 
more cautious lines and under raoi-e intelligent 
dii-ection. It is of this new experiment, which 
has already got fairly beyond the stage at which 
the faint praise conveyed in the words succes 
d'estime may be awarded, that we wish to say 
a few words. 

What Mr. Robertson has done has been to 
collect a company of capable players, neither too 
old to learn nor too young to be responsive, to 
train them in accordance with his ideals (which 
are practical in the best sense), and to impress 
upon their work his own sincerity and unifying 
intelligence. With their aid he has given per- 
formances of Moliere's " L 'Avare," Ibsen's 
" Kosmersholm," Browning's " A Blot in the 
'Scutcheon," one of the early plays of Herr 
Hauptmann, and one of the lighter comedies of 
M. PaiUeron, — performances for which fewer 
allowances have had to be made than one woidd 
have thought inevitable, considering all the diffi- 
culties attendant upon any new enterprise of 
their sort, performances that have proved more 
interesting and satisfying to those who take the 
di-ama seriously than any to be witnessed at the 
same time in the theatres of Chicago, well suj)- 
plied as those theatres have been with "attrac- 
tions " of the kind approved by the syndicate. 
The performances have not drawn large audi- 
ences, because the outing season was over when 
they began, and they have been given in a 
sparsely populated region. But they have 
attracted the right sort of attention in the right 
way, which is very much to the point. 

What is still more to the point is the fa«t that 
the work is now transferred to one of the best 
of the Chicago theatres, there to be continued, 
on the scale of four afternoon performances a 
week, throughout the season. Its brief suburban 
history has revealed it as something too good to 
be spared, and even the tribe of newspaper 
critics, predisposed to scoff at anything that 
bears the reproach of being " uplifting" or the 
stigma of " literary " quality, has been compelled, 
if not exactly to pray, at least to treat the enter- 
prise with respectf id consideration. And so the 



plays that have won a deserved success on the 
boards of the sylvan theatre are now to be 
repeated in the heart of the city's life, and are 
to be followed by others of their kind — by mas- 
terpieces bearing the names of Bjornson and 
Maeterlinck and Strindberg and Giacosa and 
Echegaray. 

These names, it need hardly be said, are the 
greatest among the dramatic writers of the 
present day. If their plays are too good for 
a public whose dramatic appetite is fed upon 
showy inanities, and whose applause means no 
more than the crackling of thorns under a pot, 
it must be so much the worse for the public. A 
theatre-man of the " practical " sort said to us, 
when Mr. Robei-tson's preliminary announcement 
was made, " Have you seen the list of the plays ?" 
This query was intended to be the last word of 
scorn concerning so hopeless a px'ogramme, and 
when we replied that it was the most interesting 
announcement we ha^l seen during a thirty 
years' acquaintance with theatrical conditions in 
Chicago, we knew well enough that the reply 
woidd mean nothing to the querist. Here were 
the two points of view clearly defined, that of 
acquiescence in a commercialized theatre de- 
graded to the level of shallow entertainment, and 
that of faith in the ]>ower of the drama to re- 
assert its lost dominion, and take its place once 
more among English-speaking people as one of 
the vital forms of creative litei-ature, as an effec- 
tive agency in the shaping of thought and conduct. 

If it be said that we are following after false 
gods in thus directing our chief attention to the 
translated drama, there is the obvious answer 
that the continental dramatists are the only 
ones now dealing seriously with the problems of 
modern life, and that they offer us the only 
available models. Mr. Robertson, no doubt, 
and all the rest of those who share in his ideals, 
would be glad enough to produce serious mod- 
ern plays originally written in the English lan- 
guage, were such to be hatl. But the category 
is well-nigh non-existent, and all our hopes of re- 
constituting the lost literary species must depend 
upon our being made to realize, by foreign ex- 
ample, how far we have lapsed from the paths 
of dramatic virtue. When English playwrights 
begin to produce works that belong to literature 
as clearly as do those of the leatling dramatic 
craftsmen of Europe, then we may begin to cut 
loose from foreign teaching, although even 
then we should be unwise to forego altogether 
the benefits of the new international solidarity 
of social and ethical aim. It is because Mr. 
Robertson's experiment, which has now become

something more than an erperiment, has been 
attempted along what we cannot but believe to 
be the right line of effort, that it has seemed 
to us to have a significance beyond its modest 
pretensions, and to deser\-e the wide publicity 
of the present statement. 



WAGXER'S FOLK-THEORY. 



In that vast medley of good sense, soond criti- 
cism, rhapsody, and rambling philosophy, the prose 
works of Richard Wagner, there is one idea which 
lifts itself again and again above the backs of its 
fellows, like the tenth wave upon the sea. It is his 
Folk-theory — the proposition that all art, music, 
literature, spring from the people ; that the articulate 
fashions itself out of the inarticulate, the defined 
out of the undefineil. as the clouds concentrate from 
the mist- The thought was. of course, not original 
with Wagner. It is implicit in the Wolffian 
hj-pothesis about the Homeric poems. Herder fos- 
tered it by his investigations into and collections of 
popular literature. Hegel philosophized about it. 
It mav, indeed, be considered the leading contribu- 
tion of Germany to universal criticism, though 
Lessing and Goethe were too wise to subscribe to 
the doctrine. And the idea has had a great run 
elsewhere. Ferguson, in his Historj- of Archi- 
tecture, applies it to that art. and describes how the 
cathedrals of Europe and the temples of India 
'• rose like exhalations " from the spontaneous con- 
tributions of work and material by the people at 
large, Tolstoi carries the thought still further, and 
asserts that the common soldiers win all the victories 
of war. with little or no assistance from their gen- 
erals. In America, the " man behind the gun " has 
become a national faith. 

The true explication of the matter depends mainly 
on what we call the people. It is obvious that every- 
thing that is done must be done by somebody. 
Every piece of work must be the product of indi- 
vidual mind and hands. The people do not gather 
together in assembly to make a proverb. All the 
men and women of a country do not put their heads 
together to create a song or ballad. The cathedral 
or temple must have someone to inspire and plan its 
building — someone to train and direct the work- 
man and look after the expense. The folk music 
must have originated at first in single minds, to 
be taken up and repeated by the masses. 

No matter how many the strong minds may be 
which inspire, orginate, create, direct the work of 
the world, they are few in number compared with 
the great multitudes of humanity. All arts, at least, 
are primarily arts of expression. And expression is 
the work of rare, sparsely scattered genius, or the 
result attained by trained and educated minds. The 
modem idea is that raciness and originality' of 
thought, vividness and terseness of utterance, are 
to be found everywhere among the people. Back to 



natural humanity, we are told. The present writer 
can claim a pretty wide acquaintance among the 
ordinary every-day folk of the world — seafaring 
I men. railroad laborers, lumbermen. Italians, Hon- 
i garians, Irish, Negroes, Brazilian and Bolivian 
peons. — and he can testify that their intelligence 
and inspired wisdom are no great things. Good- 
ness, honesty, brave endurance, they have in plenty ; 
but they are mostiy dull and silent people. The 
only great artist in expression I can recall among 
laboring folk was a small searcaptain. His line was 
profanity ; and never have I known such pyro- 
technics of swearing — the oaths darting npward 
like a rocket and bursting into myriads of corros- 
cating sparks. It is true that when we go among 
unfamiliar people we are often struck by daring 
singularities of thought or speech. — but if we 
inquire into the matter we wfll find that these 
fehciries are common propertj-, have been handed 
down from time immemorial, and were probably 
invented by a few forgotten geniuses. Owing to 
their permitted unconventionality. their imposed 
necessities, the poor do express themselves in char- 
acter — in variations of dress, habit, surroundings, 
and action — more than the well-to-do : hence their 
hmnor of contrasts and their picturesqueness. which 
artists of all kinds seize upon and exploit. As for 
the well-to-do — the middle classes — no creation of 
any kind can be expected of them as a body. Self- 
sacrifice, devotion, the fanaticism of the idea, the 
scorn of comfort and consequence, — these are the 
qtialities of originating minds, and they are not to 
be looked for among those who wish to get on or 
keep up in the world. 

The leader or the multitude — which does the 
important work of the world? As to which does 
the necessary work — the sowii^ and rea|Mng of 
harvests, the building of houses and roads, the trans- 
action of life's daily business, — there is. of course, 
no question. But this is the hand-to-mouth part of 
existence, and adds little of permanent value to the 
world. And even here it is the inspired few who 
discover and train the processes of nature, and invent 
the mechanical and labor-saving devices. But the 
things superimposed upon mere animal life — relig- 
ions, literatures, arts, and sciences, — these are the 
work of an immeasurably small minority of man- 
kind, the pioneers and pilots who go sounding on 
their dim and perilous way ahead of humanity. 

It may be urged that genius of every sort draws 
on the common experience and thought of mankind, 
that the race or nation pours into the poet or artist 
or inventor the ideas which he gives back to them 
in completed work, I confess I do not see how the 
transfusion of brains or blood from the many to 
the one is accomplished ; and there are too many 
instances of great men holding themselves solitary 
and aloof from the crowd, in whose minds have 
surged all the thoughts and imaginations of the 
world, to make the theory believable. Of course, 
such men have their progenitors in the past : they 
belong to a brotherhood of talent which stretches 



240 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



down from the beginning of time. When we say, 
for instance, that Burns's songs spring from the 
people, we merely mean that he had a dozen or 
score of predecessors whose half-forgotten work fur- 
nished him hints and help. Of course the creator, 
when he conies, has to use the material he finds at 
hand to build with. A poet has to use the language 
of his race, which is itself a gi'aveyard of dead poets 
and thinkers ; he has to look abroad and use the 
men and women he knows as models. But he has 
in his own mind and heart the thoughts and pas- 
sions — the hopes, desires, loves, hatreds, doubts, and 
scorns — which he is to express. 

What I wish to emphasize is the distinctive 
quality of genius and its comparative rarity. 
Someone has said that all the persons who have 
really moved or improved the world might be 
gathered into a not over-large hall. And the 
secondary talents — the popularizers, the propa- 
gators and imitators of others' ideas — are not such 
a mighty multitude. The vast bulk of mankind is 
taken up with getting its living, and has little time 
for things of the mind. The most popular poet or 
musician or artist has a comparatively small audi- 
ence. Only religious ideas have the power to spread 
wide and penetrate deep into the human mind. A 
man may enjoy life without the poet, but he fears 
to face death without the priest. 

The best way in which the people can cooperate 
with the creator is by receptivity — the readiness 
to applaud and reward the man who can originate. 
In some measure, the genius and the public are like 
the flint and the steel — they must conspire to pro- 
duce a blaze. Sometimes the receptivity is present ; 
but the genius does not come. The Chinese have 
throughout their history exhibited a marvellous will- 
ingness to be led and taught ; they have made the 
reward of learning, the search for literary ability, 
almost the sole business of the state ; but so far as 
we know, literary ability has refused to develop. 
More often the man of genius arises, but his state 
or people are not ready to recognize him. But 
when these two conditions combine, we get the 
spontaneous outbursts of art which star the march 
of man. In full perfection, there are hardly more 
than three of the outbursts to be counted. One was 
that bloom aud efflorescence of beauty and grandeur 
at Athens after the Persian war. Inflamed with 
patriotism, the Athenians poured the spoils of that 
victory at the feet of architects and sculptors, and 
encouraged the poets to record the greatness of their 
race in a marvellous series of dramas. The second 
period of prodigious growth was in Italy when paint- 
ing and poetry were called into being by religious 
requirements — by the revival of learning, and by 
the new joy of life. The third harvest was in 
Elizabethan England, when our race, freed from 
religious despotism, freed from the fear of foreign 
domination, demanded the most joyous and profound 
drama the world has known as an expression of its 
energy and adventurous spirit. 



A simulacrum of such prodigalities of artistic life 
has often been brought about by the action of princes 
or rulers ; their patronage being an artificial stim- 
ulation to a soil which would otherwise have been 
barren, or productive of only stunted crops. In 
such cases the people had little to say about the 
matter. No doubt the Roman senators and captains 
wondered what Augustus could see in Virgil and 
Horace and Ovid. These poets certainly did not 
get their encouragement from popular appreciation. 
It was a little better in the capital of Louis XIV., 
for the public did flock to the theatre. But the 
power of the court gave the stamp of authority to 
CorneiUe, Racine, and Molifere, rather than to their 
mediocre rivals. And it was the strong hand of 
the King which probably saved Moliere from being 
hanged by the priests or murdered by the mar- 
quises. The citizens of Saxe- Weimar absolutely 
fought against the glory which was to crown them. 
They thought Goethe an interloper, and Schiller 
no better than he ought to be; but Karl August 
persisted in his patronage, and gave Germany its 
classic literature. The subjects of Ludwig rose in 
rebellion against Wagner, and compelled the aban- 
donment of projects which, when finally carried out, 
brought so much honor to Germany. 

In general, all such art commanded from above 
lacks the breadth and natural force of the sponta- 
neous creations. For one thing, while a prince can 
give an artist leisure and opportunity, he necessarily 
and unconsciously deprives him of liberty. And 
the greatest art cannot dance in fetters. When 
literature descends to the day of dedications and 
adulation of private patrons, it breathes hard indeed, 
and finally gives up the ghost. 

One remarkable recent instance there is of a lit- 
erature almost made by the state, but made without 
any conditions of service or servility being imposed 
upon the recipients of the government help. For 
nearly a hundred years, Norway and Denmark have 
pursued a steady course of patronage to able men. 
They wanted a literature, and were willing to pay 
for it. They are, or were, poor countries, of no 
gi'eat importance on the map of Europe. They had 
no reading public to reward authors, — Hans 
Christian Andersen records that he received eighteen 
doUars for the copyright of his first long novel, — 
but by exercise of wonderful discrimination the 
governments succeeded in selecting their best men, 
not after they had become famous, but when they 
were practically unknown, and by giving them 
pensions and travelling grants kept them alive 
until their work lifted the Scandinavian countries 
to a literary equality with any modern state. 
Oehlenschlager, Hertz, Andersen, in Denmark, Ibsen 
and BjOrnson in Norway, to name only a few of the 
most eminent, were thus tided over their difficulties 
and encouraged to create. In reading Andersen's 
autobiography, or Ibsen's letters, one is struck indeed 
by the pitiful smallness of the sums they received. 
But it was enough. It was given when tliey needed

it, and it was given without any conditions. Often 
indeed one or another of these authors was in practical 
rebellion against the authorities who were feeding 
him, and was fearfully unpopular among the people 
who paid the taxes. It is almost axiomatic that a 
man of genius must be in rebellion against his time. 
It is axiomatic, too, that the new prophet shall be 
killed with the weapons of the old one. Imagine 
the English Government and the Church of England 
giving Darwin a grant to pursue investigations which 
were to undermine religion I Imagine the French 
authorities helping the Barbizon school of painters 
to prove that previous French art was false I Yet 
this is very much what the Norwegian state did in 
aiding Ibsen to pen his satires on politics and society. 
A more intelligent patronage of literature was pro- 
bably never practiced. 

There has been nothing like it in England or 
America. That part of the English Civil List 
which goes to reward men of letters or artists of 
any kind is so small, at least in comparison with 
other pensions, as to encourage contempt for such 
professions in the public mind. And the gifts are 
usually made after the recipient's working time is 
over. In America not even this much has been 
done. So far as I know, there has never been a 
dollar paid to any American writer or artist by way 
of grant or pension. Pictures and statues have of 
course been ordered by the government ; but this 
has been a matter of bargain. And positions in the 
diplomatic or consular service have been conferred 
upon men of letters. But the positions had to be 
given to somebody, and it is to be presumed that 
a due return of work has been made for the salaries. 
Such positions might keep men of genius alive, but 
they would hardly quicken their intellects or secure 
them time for the production of great works. 

This is merely a statement of facts, and not a 
complaint. Indeed, under our system of life and 
government, it is probably best to leave things as 
they are. Whom could we trust to discriminate in 
the granting of state aid ? If a thousand pensions 
were granted to-morrow for the encouragement of 
art and literature and science, it is prettj- certain 
that they wovdd go in the main to the mediocres, 
and that the men of genius would be left with an 
additional mortification. 

To return to the main theme, it seems to me a 

misuse of terms to say that literature and art spring 

from the f>eople, when, save in rare and special 

epochs, they have to be forced down the people's 

throat, either by the self-sacrifice and energj* of 

their producers, or by the authority of king or 

gfovemnient. In every age there is a commercial 

kind of literature and art, insipid, tawdrj-, foolish, 

which the people demand and are willing to pay 

for. But almost always the new, the great, the 

significant art descends on them from above, and 

they hate it, and do aU they can to destroy its 

creators.

CASUAL comment: 



LiBRAKY-scHOOL EXTEX8IOX, like University exten- 
sion, strives to make good, so far as possible, the lack 
of strict and regular training in early life. This latest 
educational extension movement is now somewhat of an 
old story in the library world, but the good and system- 
atic work done by the New Jersey Library Class, under 
the auspices of the Newark Free Public Library, has a 
certain freshness of interest as set forth in the pages 
of a small pamphlet just published by the class. In 
October, 1904, a circular was issued by the Newark 
library proposing that the library assistants of the near 
vicinity, or such of them as were not library-school 
graduates, should club together, engage a good teacher, 
and take a course of lessons in some branch of library 
economy. Thirty-three responded to the call, and Miss 
Josephine Rathbone, of the Pratt Library School, was 
' secured for a series of ten lessons in reference work, 
the class meeting on Monday mornings for two hoars 
at the Newark library and paying a fee of twenty-five 
cents for each member. An informal quiz at the end 
of each lesson, sometimes an assignment of home work, 
and an optional examination at the end of the course, 
served to give variety and completeness to the instruction 
and to keep alive the interest of the pupils. Similar 
courses have followed in the succeeding years, and 
seventy persons have profited by one or more of them. 
Mr. Dana and Miss Winser, of the Newark Ubrary, 
gave their services as teachers, and the fees to which 
they were entitled paid for the printing of the report 
to which we owe these few brief details.

The Presidest ajtd the feriodicai.s are appar- 
ently on very friendly terms with each other. From 
the White Honse go forth to this, that, and the other 
monthly magazine, articles written by our chief magis- 
trate on a considerable variety of subjects; and it is safe 
to assume that none of these contributions are found 
" unavailable " and returned with the editor's thanks. A 
pleasantly chatty article on field-mice, chipmunks, and 
other " small country neighbors," enlivens the opening 
pages of the current " Scribner," while sundry much- 
quoted utterances on " Nature Fakers," and an excursion 
into the field of Irish mythology, and a brief apprecia- 
tion of Frederic Remington, ha%-e recently appeared in 
other periodicals. Yet, curiously enough, it is only a 
year and a half ago that the student editors of a Utile 
magazine issued monthly from the Kansas City High 
School received, in reply to a reqnest for a presidential 
contribution, a courteous letter from Secretary Loeb 
announcing that " the President hereafter will not write 
for publication during his incumbency of his present 
ofBce except on matters of public interest and in an 
ofiicial way." It is interesting, then, to bear in mind, 
while reading the " Century " article on Irish Sagas, or 
the "Scribner" paper on squirrels and woodpeckers, 
that the subjects discussed are "matters of public in- 
terest," and are treated " in an official way." It is plain 
that no foolish consistency, " the hobgoblin of Uttle minds, 
adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines," 
has laid its palsying grasp on the presidential pen.

attendant, we find that whereas Louisville circulates 
2248, Boston 4348, Chicago 8351, and Los Angeles 
14,738, the thrifty town on the Illinois river gets its 
books into use at the rate of 23,717 per annum for each 
attendant employed. Another interesting question is. 
How long does it take to issue any book called for ? 
The average time in Boston, according to a late report, 
is ten minutes, as Librarian Willcox (of Peoria) informs 
us; and he continues, referring to his own library: " The 
average of three trial tests made by us on Saturdays at 
our busiest hom-s, was 307 books in 101 minutes, or a 
trifle more than tliree a minute." But that is ambigu- 
ous. One might stand at the delivery desk in Boston 
of a Saturday afternoon and watch the stream of books 
flowing over the counter in an uninterrupted current, 
and possibly one would find that even more than 307 
were sometimes issued in the space of one hour and 
forty-one minutes. The real point is, how long before 
the passage of the first book noted in this continuous 
stream was this particular volume applied for ? How- 
ever, we do not doubt the nimbleness of the Peoria 
attendants. On the subject of open shelves, Mr. Willcox 
feels a little disheartened. Even with a limited appli- 
cation of the system, he has to report an average loss 
of ninety-nine volumes a year for the last three years. 
But he appears to comfort himself a little with the 
assurance that other libraries are sufl:ering larger losses 
than his; for he prints Boston's shameful record of 
1693 volumes stolen in one year, the Providence loss 
of 1796, and the Los Angeles record-breaking total of 
4044 a year for two years. What is the public con- 
science coming to ? The situation seems to call for 
something like a grand mass-meeting of protest and 
reform, or a thorongh and simultaneous ventilating of 
the whole disagreeable busmess in the public press. 
Who will point out the effective remedy — short of a 
return to chains and padlocks for library books ?

Shelley's letters to Miss Hitchener, sparingly 
quoted from by Professor Dowden m liis life of the 
poet, were last year added to the manuscript treasiu'es of 
the British Museum, which in the same year became the 
richer by one hundred and fifty-eight published works 
or editions previously unknown to bibliographers. Con- 
cerning the correspondence between Shelley and Miss 
Hitchener, it appears to bear witness to a friendship as 
violent as it was brief. The lady kept a school at 
Hurstpierpoint in Sussex, and became favorably known 
to the poet in his early republican days because of her 
advanced opinions in politics and religion. So enthu- 
siastic did he become in his admiration for her that he 
not only sent her a boxful of his revolutionary pam- 
phlets, which nearly got him into trouble with the 
custom-house officers at Holyhead, but he also insisted 
on her joining his household soon after his unhappy 
marriage with Harriet Westbrook. At first regarded 
by the Shelleys as a second Portia, and so named by 
them, the gifted lady soon found herself less passion- 
ately admired ; in fact, the " Portia " gave place to 
" the Brown Demon," and thus the friendsliip came to 
an end. The lesson of this characteristic episode, those 
who run may read. ... 

Spenser, the poets' poet, has been made in some 
measure the children's poet as well, in Philadelphia, 
where the Story Hour conducted by the Free Library 
has pleasantly familiarized many boys and girls with 
the legends of the "Faerie Queene." Mr. John 



Thomson, the librariani says in his Eleventh Annual 
Report: " It is still necessary in some sections of the 
city to issue tickets limiting the number of the children 
to the capacity of the rooms used for the purpose [of 
the Story Hour] and to avoid overcrowding and its 
consequent disorder. Seventeen members of the Free 
Library staff have taken part in the programmes this 
winter. They have devoted time outside of their 
regular hours to serious study in preparing the stories, 
and have entered into the work with that hearty enthu- 
siasm which ensures success. The programme of the 
year has contained some very popular features. Four 
well-chosen stories from Spenser's ' Faerie Queene ' have 
led to the reading of the simpler editions of the English 
Classsics, and ' Una and the Lion,' ' St. George and the 
Dragon,' ' Britomart and Florimel ' have become well 
known to hundreds of children." This is an encourag- 
ing report. We need not despair of the republic so 
long as its schoolchildren take delight in Spenser. One 
is reminded incidentally of Pope's boyish fondness for 
the " Faerie Queene " more than two centuries ago. 
" There is something in Spenser," he declared in later 
life, " which pleases one as strongly in one's old age as 
it did in one's youth. I read the ' Faerie Queene ' when 
I was about twelve with a vast deal of delight, and I 
think it gave me as much when I read it over a year or 
two ago." . . . 

The old-fashioned way of writing history, the 
way of Rollins and Robertson and Hume and Gibbon, 
is evidently the way chosen by Dr. Emil Reich in the 
appalling task he is now engaged upon, the writing of a 
" General History of Western Nations from 5000 B.C. 
to 1900 A.D." A histoi-iographer of the modern school, 
spending more time in the recording of events than those 
events themselves occupied, woidd need a score or more 
of Methuselah-lives to do full justice to such an under- 
taking. But the fluent and versatile author of " Success 
in Life " and " Germany's Swelled Head " shows no 
signs of flinching. Emulating the doers of large tilings 
in literature and learning, he heroically enters upon his 
self-appointed task. " I attempt to do for the history of 
the Western nations," he declares, " what Bichat did for 
Anatomy, Bopp and Pott for Linguistics, or Savigiiy 
for Roman Law. I try to write the ' General Part ' of 
history." And then he explains that " at the basis of 
all that happened in the history of VV^estern nations there 
is a series of some twenty to thirty general facts, which 
singly, and still more by meeting, blending, or antago- 
nizing one another, created a multitude of particular 
facts. The present work treats mainly of these general 
facts, each of which has conditions, details, and effects 
of its own." History has as many meanings, and is 
capable of being told in as many ways, as there are 
historians, not to say readers ; and that is I'eason enough 
for Dr. Reich's re-telling of the old story. May Clio 
smile upon him ! ... 

What Shakespeare's contemporaries ate and 
DRANK is not without interest to his present-day readers. 
The Elizabethans, as one might imagine, were not 
exactly delicate feasters languidly toying with half- 
tasted dainties. There has just been made public a 
letter from the Earl of Leicester to Lord Burleigh 
wherein is found an amusing reference to the virgin 
queen's love of malt liquor, and her insistence upon 
having it good and strong. " There is not one drop of 
good drink for her here," writes the Earl from Hatfield. 
" We were fain to send to London and Kenilworth and

divers other places where ale was; her own beer was so 
strong as there was no man able to drink it." That was 
an age that knew not breakfast food; no pre-digested, 
concentrated, brain-biiilding preparation of crumpled 
crumbs or crinkled com figured on the morning table of 
sixteenth-century England. Bread and ale were the 
staples on which they breakfasted, or at least these 
appear to have been the chief items of the queen's morn- 
ing meal. In her father's reign, we are told, the 
maids of honor were allowed for breakfast one loaf, 
one manchet, two gallons of ale, and a pitcher of wine. 
Of a certain Lady Lucy it is wi-itten that she daily 
broke her fast upon a chine of beef, a loaf, and a gallon 
of ale, while for her pillow meal she was served with 
a posset porridge, a goodly slice of mutton, a loaf, and 
a gallon of ale. No wonder there were giants in those 
days. , . . 

XovEL-NOTKS OF AN " OLD FOGY," as he calls him- 
self, suggest a few comments. Dr. William Everett, 
in a newspaper article on " An ' Old Fogy's ' Novel 
Reading," calls us back to the re-perusal of some of the 
imperishable masterpieces — and also to some whose 
imperishability is not so free from doubt. His praise 
of Scott, glowing though it is, is not excessive. What 
appreciative reader of the Waverleys will ever tire of 
hearuig or uttering eulogies on their author? Has it 
ever been noted, by the way, how almost invariably a 
true lover of Shakespeare proves to be also a loyal 
admirer of Scott? From the more immediately and 
perhaps irresistibly appealing ephemeralities of the cur- 
rent " best sellers," what a satisfaction to turn back and 
solace oneself with the everlasting humanities of those 
two immortals! They impart a sense of security and 
permanence that fails us in the bewildering variety and 
copiousness of twentieth-century fiction. Among other 
old authors lauded by Dr. Everett are Miss Austen, Mrs. 
Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte, Samuel Lover, Bulwer Lytton, 
Henry Kingsley, Thackeray, and Dickens. But the 
faults, the obvious faidts, of Lover and Bulwer must 
tell more and more heavily against them, while even 
Charlotte Bronte will hardly succeed again in creating 
such a delirium of delight as that described by Dr. 
Everett. ... 

English stage cen80r.ship, with its amusing and 
frequently irritating absurdities and inconsistencies, may 
possibly undergo a long-desired reform before the cen- 
tury is much older. This at least is the hope of Mr. 
Edward Gamett (son of Dr. Richard Gamett) whose 
play, " The Breaking Point," was recently rejected by 
the official censor as unfit for presentation. The author 
now makes an appeal to the public by printing his play 
and offering as literature what he was forbidden to 
present as acted drama. Should his readers take sides 
with him and regard the suppression as imwarranted, 
their moi-al support, added to a long accumulation of 
indignant protests in the past, might lead to an over- 
turning of the old order — reluctant though the old 
order is to change in conservative Britain. Meanwhile 
whatever the injured playwright may have lost in tem- 
per should be more than made up to him in pounds, 
shillings, and pence; for what could more strongly 
appeal to a reader's curiosity — and, what is more im- 
portant, to a book-buyer's purse — than a suppressed 
play? ... 

The secret of Sully-Prudhomme's fame, the rea- 
son of the haunting charm of some of his lines, is to be 



sought in a hopeless passion that swept him off his feet 
and carried him some distance up the slope of Parnassus 
when he was already thirty years old and his character 
too maturely developed to admit of recovery from his 
disappointment. " She " married another, and he wrote 
" Les Vaines Tendresses." It is said that certain exqui- 
site fragments of his poems, notably the simple line from 
" Le Vase Bris^," — 

'■ N'y tonchez pas. il est bria^," — 
have not only become classic as literature, but have 
entered into the language and been adopted as proverbs. 
Again, it seems, we have illustrated in this poet, whose 
recent death turns our eyes upon him if only for a 
passing moment, the old truth that whatever man 
achieves of great and worthy and lasting is paid for 
out of his very heart's blood; that only he who can 
spend himself, who will give his life, shall win immor- 
tality. . . . 

Shakespeare the all-sufficing was a whole lib- 
rary to the late Emily Dickinson, who in girlhood was 
all but forbidden by her father to read any book except 
the Bible. " Kavanagh," however, was smuggled into 
the house, and also Lydia Maria Child's " I.«tters from 
New York"; or, rather, the latter found refuge in a box 
beside the doorstep, the former safely running the block- 
ade and getting itself hidden under the piano. After 
reading " Kavanagh," says Colonel Higginson, " Emily 
thought in ecsta.sy, ' This then is a book, and there are 
more of them ! ' " Losing, temporarily, the use of her 
eyes, it was a comfort to her to think that there were 
so few real books that she could easily find someone to 
read them all to her. But when, Liter, she so far 
recovered her eyesight as to read Shakespeare, she said 
to herself, " Why is any other book needed ? " Per- 
haps the secret of Emily Dickinson's originality, of her 
never reminding her readers of anyone but herself, is 
to be found in that meagreness of literary fare that early 
forced her to rely on her own resources of imagination 
and conjecture and high thinking. What would have 
been intellectual starvation to most others was intellec- 
tual stimulation to her.

The reading of prisoners, which has lately been 
brought into notice and made a subject of discussion 
through the report of the librarian at Darlinghurst jail 
in Sydney, N. S. W., is very much what might have been 
expected. A student of the subject in English prisons 
reports " Monte Cristo " as a prime favorite, though 
(rather surprisingly) Miss Braddon is placed at the head 
of the list as the jail-bird's chosen story-teller; and of 
her novels " Ishmael " is most in demand. " Ouida," 
EdnaLyall, Wilkie Collins, Mrs. Henry Wood, Dickens, 
Rolf Boldrewood, and Zola have numerous readers. 
Thackeray has his admirers among the better educated, 
and even George Eliot has a certain vogue in criminal 
circles, her " Romola," " Mill on the Floss," and " Adam 
Bede " being most often asked for and most lovingly 
lingered over. Magazines, in bound volumes, are popu- 
lar, but are regarded as rather thin diet — an opinion 
not peculiar to convicts. Tliat these victims of an un- 
fortimate heredity and an xmfavorable environment 
are now allowed to solace their captivity with a class 
of literature somew^hat different from "The Washer-

A VETERAN'S Memories of War 
AND Peace.* 



Retired from the army service nearly thirteen 
years ago, Gen. Oliver Otis Howard has since 
been occupied in educational and literary pur- 
suits, especially in furthering the fortunes of 
various schools for colored youth, such as Howard 
University, Atlanta University, Lincoln Memo- 
rial University, and many others, and in pre- 
paring for publication the rich reminiscences of 
a long and active and variously useful life. 

Born in 1830 at Leeds, Maine, the descendant 
of generations of New England Howards and 
Otises, he feels a pardonable satisfaction in the 
favorable circumstances of his origin and up- 
bringing, and may well have been fired from the 
first with an ardent ambition to do something 
to enhance, in his own person, the fair fame of 
his lineage. Farm work and country schooling 
contributed to the shaping of body and mind, 
until he began his preparation for coUege at the 
Hallo well high school — of whose excellent cur- 
riculum at a somewhat later date Mrs. Martha 
Baker Dunn has written entertainingly in her 
" Cicero in Maine." Entering Bowdoin at the 
early age of fifteen, the energetic la<l was gradu- 
ated in 1850, in the same class with Senator 
Frye and the late Charles CarroU Everett, Dean 
of the Harvard Divinity School, whom an odd 
trick of the memory makes him call Carroll S. 
Everett. In college at the same time also was 
" Mell " Fuller, the present Chief Justice of our 
Supreme Court. 

From Bowdoin young Howard proceeded, in 
consequence of an unexpected vacancy, to the 
Military Academy at West Point, where he led 
his class at the end of the first year and ranked 
fourth at the end of his course. Choosing the 
ordnance department, he served first at the 
Watervliet Arsenal, then as Chief of Ordnance 
in the Seminole campaign in Florida, and was 
then appointed instructor in mathematics at 
West Point, whence at the outbreak of the 
Civil War he hastened home to assume com- 
mand of the Third Maine Regiment ; and from 
that time onward his movements become a part 
of our national history. Rising from colonel to 
major-general, from the command of a regiment 
to that of an army corps, he took part in forty- 
seven important engagements, the most note- 
worthy of which was the battle of Gettysburg,

where he commanded the left wing of the 
Federal forces. Subsequently transferred to 
the West, he saw a good deal of Grant and 
Sherman, and has recorded his impressions of 
those two generals, with the latter of whom 
he had abundant opportmiity to become well 
acquainted in the course of the Atlanta cam- 
paign and the march to the sea. Of General 
Howard's services as Commissioner of the 
Freedmen's Bureau much could be said ; but our 
remaining space can better be given to illustra- 
tive extracts from the book itself. A passage 
from his West Point life — from his experience 
as teacher there — shows him to have been even 
then a man of larger interests, of a more serious 
and scholarly turn of mind, than the ordinary 
army officer. 

" I took up the Hebrew language and recited with 
some regularity to an p]piscopal clergyman near High- 
land Falls. He was a scholarly man and interested 
himself greatly in my progress. Lectures, in connection 
with Bible study, I delivered habitually once a week in 
what we called ' the little church under the hill.' This 
church where the soldiers' families attended was so 
arranged that a partition separated the altar and all that 
belonged to it from the main room. This enabled the 
Catholics to have their services in the morning, when 
the partition doors were opened, and the other people 
in the afternoon and evening, when the doors were 
closed. Here we had, every Sabbath for nearly four 
years, a thriving Sunday school, of which I was the 
superintendent. In this active Christian work, cadets, 
the chaplain's daughters, and other ladies of the post 
assisted regularly with the music and as teachers. 
Usually in the evening we had a Methodist clergyman 
to preach and conduct the services. Sometimes our chap- 
lain, who was an Episcopalian, would give an address, 
and sometimes the clergy of other denominations. 

" I always endeavored to do something in addition to 
what my military duties proper and the preparation for 
them required. It may be said that this was not a fair 
preparation for what might be required of me sooner or 
later m the army proper; but I do not think so. This 
training to which I subjected myself enlarged my sympa- 
thies and acquaintanceship, and was, indeed, a stepping- 
stone to all that followed." 

It was through Blaine's friendly offices that the 
command of the Maine regiment was obtained 
for the young West Point graduate, Mr. Blaine 
being then Speaker of the state House of Rep- 
resentatives. A picture of the budding states- 
man is thus drawn : 

" One coiUd hardly find a more striking character. 
His figure was good — nearly six feet and well propor- 
tioned; his hair, wliat you could see of it under his soft 
hat pushed far back, was a darkish brown. It showed 
the disorder due to sundry thrusts of the flugers. His 
coat, a little long, was partially buttoned. This, with 
the collar, shirt front, and necktie, had the negligee air 
of a di-ess never thought of after the first adjustment. 
His head was a model in size and shape, with a forehead 
high and broad, and he had, as you would anticipate in 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



245 



m. Btroag fmee, a large nose. Bnt the distingnishing 
feature of his face was that pair of dark-gray eyes, very 
full and bright. He wore no beard, had a slight lisp 
in ^>eech, with a clear, penetrating, nasal tone. He 
excelled even the nervous Washbnm in rapid utterance. 
Nobody in the Maine House of Bepresentatives, where 
he had been for two years and of which he was now the 
Speaker, could match him in debate. He was, as an 
opponent, sharp, fearless, aggressive, and uncompromis- 
ing; he always had given in wordy conflicts, as village 
editor and as debater in pnUic assemblies, blow for 
Mow with ever-increasing momentom. Yet from his 
consummate management he had already become pop- 
ular. Such was Blaine at thirty years of age." 

Instead of quoting any harrowing descrip- 
tions of battle and bloodshed, let us cite the 
author's reflections upon the lesson of such 
scenes in military- history. In his detailed and 
interesting account of the battle of Grettysburg, 
he writes : 

" It is sometimes said to me that writing and speak- 
ing upon the events of the war may have a deleterious 
influence upon youth. I can conceive of two reasons 
for such a warning — one, that a soldier by his enthu- 
siasm may, even unconsciously, infuse into his writing 
and speech the war spirit, and thus incite strong desires 
in younger minds for similar excitements and deeds; 
and, secondly, a soldier deeply affected as he must have 
been in our great struggle for national existence, may 
not take sufficient pains in his accounts of historic inci- 
dents to allay any spirit of animoaty or dissension which 
may still exist. 

" But with regard to the first, I think there is need 
of a faithful portraiture of what we may call the after- 
battle, a panorama which shows with fidelity the fields 
covered with dead men and horses: with the wounded, 
numerous and helpless, stretched on the ground in 
masses, each waiting his torn; the rough hospitals 
with hay and straw for bedding, saturated with blood 
and wet with the rain; houses torn into fragments; 
every species of property ruthlessly demolished or 
deatroyed — these, which we cannot well exaggerate, 
and such as these, cry out against the horrors, the hate- 
ful ravages, and the countless expense of war. They 
show plainly to our children that war, with its embodied 
woes and fnries, must be avoided, except as the last 
appeal for existence, or for the rights which are more 
valuable than life itselL" 

The author dates his more intimate acquaint- 
ance with Sherman from the evening of Nov. 
14. 1863, when Grant and Sherman had an 
interview at Chattanooga, at which the writer 
himself was present. 

" My real acquaintance with Sherman began that 
evening. It was a privilege to see these two men. 
Grant and Sherman, together. Their unusual friend- 
ship — unusual in men who would naturally be rivals — 
was like that of David and .Jonathan. It was always 
evident, and did not grow from likeness, but from 
nnlikeness. They appeared rather the complements of 
each other — where the one was especially strong, the 
other was less so, and rice rena. It was a marriage 
of characters, in sympathy, by the adjustment of dif- 
ferences. 

"Grant in oommand was, as everybody then said. 



habitoally reticent. Sherman was never so. Grant 
meditated on the situation, withholding his opinion 
until his plan was well matured. Sherman quickly, 
brilliantly, gave you half a dozen. Grant, once speaking 
of Sherman in cadet phiaae, said: " He bones all the 
time while he is awake; as much on horseback as in 
camp or at his quarters." It was true. Sherman had 
remarkable topographical abUity. A country that he 
once saw he could not forget. The cities, the villages, 
the streams, the mountains, hills, and divides — these 
were as easily seen by him as human faces, and the 
features were always on hand for use. It made him 
ever playing at draughts with his adversary. Let the 
enemy move and Sherman's move was instant and well 
chosen. 

" Grant appeared more inclined to systematixe and 
simplify; bring up sufficient force to outnumber; do 
uneijjected things; take promptly the offensive; follow 
up a victory. It was a simple, straightforward calco- 
lus, which avoided too much complication. It made 
Grant the man for campaign and battle. Sherman was 
always at his best in campaign — in general maneuvers — 
better than in actual battle. His great knowledge of 
I history, his tc^wgraphical scope, his intense suggestive 
I faculties seemed often to be impaired by the actual 
conflict. And the reason is plain; such a mind and 
body as his, full of impulse, full of fire, are more likely 
to be perturbed by excitement than is the more iion- 
boimd constitution of a Grant or a Thomas." 

Gen. Howard's work in the Northwest among 
the Indians, at West Point as Superintendent 
of the Military Academy, and in numerous other 
fields of labor, must be passed by without even 
a brief word of appreciative mention. The whole 
story, fully but modestly told, will be found in 
his book. He takes the reader delightfully into 
his confidence, and writes with an astonishing 
recollection of detail. An autobiography at 
once so full of incident and so free from matters 
of small importance has rarely been produced. 
From first to last there is a sense of reality, of 
human significance, in the two ample volumes. 
Their clear print and typographical correctness 
will recommend them to failing eyes and to 
readers impatient of compositors' blunders.

There is an introduction of 135 pages in which 
the author lays down certain laws of the evolu- 
tion of culture and the history of civilization. 
In these preliminary statements are some views 
which are distinctly personal, and little likely 
to receive the unqualified approval of readers. 
The sketch is, however, interesting, suggestive, 
and entirely in place. 

Coming to his subject proper, the author 
first presents general facts regarding the land 
and its peoples. He considers the Japanese a 
mixture of Ural-Altaic and Malay, and thinks 
these elements are stiU to be traced geogTaph- 
ically — the Ural-Altaic landing at Nagato and 
following along the coast of the Sea of Japan, 
while the Malays followed along the Interior 
Sea. Mixing, with little influence from the 
aboriginal Ainu, these elements have given the 
present Japanese. The aiithor then studies 
in detail, for each minor period of time, the 
progress and movement of culture. He clearly 
describes the conditions of life, customs, govern- 
ment, politics, literature, art, and religion of 
each. Nowhere else, perhaps, can the student 
find so satisfactory a series of pictures — de- 
tailed paintings — of the Japanese. And it is 
not merely an interestingly descriptive presen- 
tation ; causes, motives, tendencies, are con- 
stantly kept in view. It is Green's " History 
of the English People " over again, but done 
for the Japanese by a foreigner. The move- 
ment is well sustained, the wealth of detail re- 
markable, the style attractive, with some striking 
descriptions of scenery. Frequent quotations 
from Japanese literature are given, not as 
samples of Japanese writing so much as for the 
matter they contain. To render many of his dis- 
cussions clear to non-specialists in the oriental 
field, the author is often compelled to present 
actual studies of subjects both Japanese and 
Chinese. Thus, preliminarily to considering the 
introduction and influence of Confucianism in 



Japan, the author enters into a serious exam- 
ination of Confucianism in itself and in its 
relations to general civilization. 

One most important feature in our author's 
treatment is his constant emphasis upon the 
outside influences that have acted upon Japan 
and affected its development. From its insular 
nature, Japan is necessarily isolated, and lias 
escaped much of contact with other nations. 
This has no doubt had its influence in shaping 
the Japanese character. But in spite of its 
relative isolation, Japan has always received 
influences from without, and our author delights 
to trace these in detail. Everyone, of course, 
knows that China and Korea have made a 
profound impression upon Japan, but compara- 
tively few realize that many more western lands 
have long been jjotent in her development. Our 
author himself says : 

" But priests and literati have taught the Japanese 
more than Buddhism and Confucianism; they have 
taught them the civilization of India and of China, and 
therefore that of the entire vvorld. Bahylonia and 
Egypt, mothers of all culture, Persia — mistress of 
India with Darius, — Greece — mistress of India with 
Alexander, — the Roman Empire, sovereigns of Asia 
Minor, Cliristianity, preached even to the Descan and 
in Central Asia, have all left tlieir trace in the civiliza- 
tion of India and even in that of China. Henceforth 
the Japanese, rare as their relations with the Continent 
may have been tlu-ough centuries, participated in the 
life of the entire world, since they have known the uni- 
versal civilization." 

And this is of Ancient Japan. Since then, 
similar influences have continuously made them- 
selves felt. Japan, though lai-gely pursuing a 
course of independent development, has never 
been actually shut off from the world. 

Another point of great interest, somewhat 
akin to the preceding, while thrown sharply 
into view by the author's treatment, is sug- 
gested rather than actually discvissed. This is 
the remarkable synchronism of great world 
movements in separated areas. Feudalism in 
Japan coincides with feudalism elsewhere ; wide- 
spread and pervasive belief in witchcraft afflicts 
New England and Japan at the same time ; 
outbreaks of emotional religion sweep the world 
irrespective of the petty contact between nations ; 
periods of unbelief and doubt affect all men 
simultaneously, — the last half of the nineteenth 
century weakened faith alike in Christian dogma, 
in Buddhist faith and practice, in American 
Indian animism, in African fetichism. And 
one may seriously inquire whether we are not 
now at the beginning of a religious revival which 
wiU sweep the world — not to the enthi-onement 
of one great world-religion, but to the strength-

ening and rebuUding of many now tottering 
creetls. It is not fair to shoulder ail the above 
illustrations on our author, nor to conunit him 
to any prediction ; but he clearly brings out 
the fact of such synchronisms. They are most 
interesting, and cannot be fidly explained by 
contact and interesting influences. 

One characteristic of the Japanese that can- 
not be too much emphasized is clearly brought 
out in this work. Fraetz wTote, in 1565, that 
the Japanese found great pleasure in meeting 
strangers and questioning them with curiosity 
upon the manners and customs of other coun- 
tries, even into the least details. So at the 
time of Will Adams, the constant questioning 
and writing down greatly impresse<l the English 
and Dutch visitors. Golownin, the Russian 
prisoner of 1811, left a delightful account of 
the repeated inquisitions through which he 
passed. Avidity to take in from without is no 
new trait in Japanese character. 

The work is supplied with maps, chrono- 
logical tables, glossaries, and indexes, rendering 
it thoroughly useful to the student.

" Considering the imjwrtance of the position 
occupietl by Thomas Gainsborough in the British 
school of painting, surprisingl}' few details of his 
life have been preserved." Thus does Mr. 
WiUiam B. Boulton, with perhaps no intention 
whatever of forestalling criticism, begin his pref- 
atory note to " Thomas Gainsborough : His Life, 
Work, Friends, and Sitters." DecidetUy, Mr. 
Boulton has no real need to plead meagreness 
of detail and shoi*tage of anecdote, — unless, in- 
deed, his ideal of biography is only satisfied by 
the t\so fat voliunes of imdigested original docu- 
ments with which a passing literary fashion is 
just now exasperating a long-suffering public. 
More details of Gainslx)rough's early life, to 
be sure, would probably help to elucidate the 
painter's seeming inconsistencies, — which are 
not so very inconsistent after all. His was 
another case of the familiar paradox : on the one 
hand the artist, with his polished and delicate 
manner, his genuinely refined appreciation of 
beauty and iimocence ; on the other the man, 
who ' damned ladies and gentlemen ' to his friend

Jackson, filled aU his letters with unprintable 
expressions, and was as anxious as many a great 
man before him to l)e known as a good fellow 
and a sad dog, — apparently on the slender show- 
ing of a few youthful escapades indulged in under 
the competent tutelage of Francis Hayman. 

But in spite of unavoidable gaps and defi- 
ciencies, even the early chapters of the book are 
not dull. Throughout his life Gainsborough had 
many interesting friends, most of them actors 
or musicians ; while all the wit and beauty of 
eighteenth century England sat to him for por- 
traits, and the royal family patronized him with 
a truly royal abandon. Some anecdotes which 
Mr. Boulton relates of Gainsborough's patrons 
have but the slightest connection with the painter, 
but they all help to reproduce the atmosphere of 
the time in which he lived, and to give, by an 
economically suggestive method, that sense of 
background which many more bulky and pre- 
tentious biographies satUy lack. 

Gainsborough was a spicy and a fluent letter- 
writer, and it is perhaps by quoting his corre- 
spondence with William Jackson of Exeter, a 
musician, and with Garrick, that Mr. Boulton 
throws most light on the artist's whimsical 
and capricious temper and independent spirit. 
A letter to Jackson, dated at Bath in 1769, 
shows Gainsborough in his most delightful vein. 

" My dear Jackson, — Now you seem to lay too much 
stress upon me, and show yourself to be a serious fellow. 
I question, if you could splice all my letters together, 
whether you could find more connection and sense in 
them than in many landskips joined, where half a tree was 
to meet half a church to make a principal object. . . . 

" Depend upon it, Jackson, you have more sense in 
your little finger than I have in my whole body and 
head ; I am the most inconsistent changeable being, so 
full of fits and starts, that if you mind what I say, it 
will be shutting your eyes to some purpose. I'm only 
sensible of meaning, and of having once said, that I 
wished you lived nearer to me. . . . You have one 
fault, which I must tell you of: you can stop to gaze 
with wonder and astonishment upon such a fellow as 

H y, and let slip all his merit of care, labour, and 

prudent selfishness through your own fingers. 

" I look upon this letter as one of my most agreeable 
performances, so don't let's have any of your airs. I 
could say a deal noore; but what can a man say, pent 
up in a comer thus ? — Yours, T. G." 

Jackson seems to have been rather a thank- 
less friend ; his coldly critical, complacent style 
in writing of Gainsborough makes an unpleas- 
ant contrast with Gainsborough's impidsive 
solicitude for the mediocre musician's every 
interest. " Pray send me word," he writes, 
when news has come that Jackson is ill, 
" whether there is any occasion for Doctor 
Moysey to come to you, in Palmer's opinion —

damn your own. for you are too much like me 
to know how it is with you." 

Equally delightful are the letters to Garrick, 
filled with discussions about the actor's art, in 
which Gainsborough was deeply interested, and 
with considerations regarduig an idealized por- 
trait of Shakespeare which Grainsborough had 
in earnest contemplation for several years. 
" Shakespeare shall come forth, as the lawyer 
says," he declares gaily. "' Damn the original 
picture of him, with your leave, for I think a 
stupider face I never saw, except D — h's." 
But finally he abandons the project — with 
equal gayety. " Shakespeare's bust is a silly 
smiling thing, and I have not sense enough to 
make him more sensible in the picture ; and so 
I teU ye, you shall not see it." 

In the person of Governor Philip Thicknesse, 
Gainsborough had a friend and patron whose 
generosity and solicitous oversight, always exer- 
cised with characteristic eccentricity, must have 
been as inconvenient at times as at other times 
they were welcome. At the painter's death 
Thicknesse published a short but very inter- 
esting memoir of him, which is authority for 
many good stories, seldom accurately dated, but 
full of the spirit which is more essential than 
the letter. One such anecdote foUows. 

" When a certain duchess sent to know the reason why 
her picture was not sent home, he gave it a wipe in the 
face with his background brush, and sent her word that 
her Grace was too hard for him ; he would not, he said, 
paint it. That inelegant message lost her an excellent 
representation of her beautiful person (for she was beau- 
tiful), and Gainsborough's spirit deprived him of a 
hundred guineas." 

Governor Thicknesse did not like Mrs. Gains- 
borough. He relates how, when he was helping 
Gainsborough with the troublesome business of 
finding a house in Bath, and they went to the 
artist's wife to report progress, she was thrown 
into a panic at the mention of the fifty pounds 
rent. 

" The poor woman, highly alarmed, thinking it must 
all come out of her annuity, exclaimed, ' Fifty pounds a 
year! Mr. Gainsborough are you going to throw your- 
self into gaol ? ' But upon my telling her that if she 
did not approve of the lodgings at fifty pounds a year 
he should take a house of a hundred and fifty, and that 
I would pay the rent if he could not, Margaret's alarms 
were moderated." 

There was perhaps some excuse for the lady at 
this time, for Gainsborough had yet to make his 
name, but her continued parsimony in later years 
is certainly against her. Governor Thicknesse 
assures us that if Gainsborough, tired with stand- 
ing before his easel, went to the city on business 
and took a hackney coach to ease his tired limbs. 



" He was obliged to be set down in St. James's Square, 
or out of sight of his own windows, for fear of another 
set down not so convenient either to his head or his heels 
as riding out twelve pennyworth of coach hire, after 
having earned fifty guineas previously thereto." 

But in spite of the Governor's anecdotes, and 
others, Gain.sborough was apparently very fond 
of his wife, and though he lived in a time when 
scandal was busy in the painting-rooms of fash- 
ionable artists, never a word of it was associated 
with his name. 

We might go on quoting from Mr. BoiUton 
almost indefinitely, for he has placed unlimited 
stores of good things at the disposal of his 
readers. He has utilized the accepted sources 
of biographical material, marshalling his facts 
in simple orderly fashion, and dealing with them 
in a dignified and yet thoroughly genial and 
appreciative way. His descriptions of Gains- 
borough's works and his critical comments are 
likewise written with rare skill and discrimina^ 
tion, and it is only because they are less quota- 
ble than the narrative portions of the book that 
less has been said about them here. 

Numerous half-tones reproduce Grainsbor- 
ough's portraits and a few of the " landskips," 
in the painting of which, according to a curious 
tradition, the artist was happiest. His friend 
Angelo declares : " Gainsborough, for all his 
apparent playfulness of style, often told Quin, 
who again assured my father of the fact, that 
nothing coidd equal the devilism of portrait 
painting." Wliich sounds so like Guinsborough 
that we shoidd never think of questioning its 
somewhat complicated authenticity.

facts aboat our competition with Europe, our 
protective policy, labor, trusts, railways, bank- 
ing, and economic thinking in the United States. 
The labor leaders have already found what they 
regard as the heel of Achilles in the part relating 
to trade unions, and will have none of the au- 
thor's advice : and it must be admitted that he 
has not duly considered in his argument some 
very important aspects of the subject. If the 
advocates of the present high tariff read his 
remarks on that subject, he ma.\ expect some 
profane comments from that camp. It is diffi- 
cult to please all : probably it is best to try to 
be accurate as to facts, for these stand a great 
deal of hammering. 

Germany has advanced so rapidly during 
the past few years that England and America 
are compelled to inquire for the causes of her 
phenomenal success in manufactures and com- 
merce. Not long ago, this country, which held 
the " empire of the air," was counted out of the 
race of ri%als in business. The essential causes 
of this material success seem to be scientific 
investigation, industry, and reliabilitj-, fertile 
invention, improved organization, and rational 
care for the workman without whom science and 
invention would be useless. ^Ir. Dawson, in 
his book on " The German Workman," has 
given a very readable account of that splendid 
system of " social policy "" by means of which 
the health and efficiency of the workmen have 
been promoted as by no other people in the his- 
tory of the race. The principal measure is the 
imperial industrial insurance system, by means 
of which millions of persons are lifted above the 
need of charity and the soiuces of sickness are 
stopped at their very springs. All the efssential 
features of this masterly policy are clearly de- 
scribed in Mr. Dawson's book. 

The argument of ]Mr. Tenney, in " Contrasts 
in Social Progress," is cumulative. The assump- 
tion — or, more fairly, the working hypothesis 
— is the idealistic theory of social progress, in 
opposition to the materialistic or economic inter- 
pretation of history. The history of the hiunan 
race is a series of social experiments, extending 
over vast areas of territory, over billions of lives, 
and over ages of time. The peoples chosen for 
stiidy are the Hindus, Chinese. Moslems, and 
Christians. The result of these experiments is 
held to be that, while all these peoples show the 
benign influence of the truth they knew, the 
essential truths of Christianity- have had a pe- 
culiar and special power for good, and surpass 
all others in power for improvement of social 
conditions. The illustrations of this superiority 



are found in civic conditions, family life, educa^ 
tion, literature, moral thought, altruistic service, 
self-extending altruistic power. Time is an 
essential factor in progress. Christianity itself 
has never been perfectly represented by its fol- 
lowers, and the church has been slow to appre- 
ciate the meaning of the truths for which it 
stood. The world is yet in its infancy, and these 
ideas have yet before them a vast future for 
development and creative influence. The central 
ideas which have most transformed mankind 
are those of the unity and moral character of 
God, spiritual worship, fraternity of the children 
of a common Father, and eternal life. The 
author manifestly aims to be fair ; he uncovers 
the errors and evils of Christendom, and praises 
the virtues and truths of alien civilizations, 
and everywhere are the evidences of painstaking 
industry in the collection of facts and of expert 
judgments. 

The English university life is in an atmos- 
phere of leisure ; the roots of the tree of knowl- 
edge are not pulled up every hour, to measure 
their growth in the night. Students there take 
a long time to read, reflect, compose their sen- 
tences, and send out a worthy thought in fitting 
form. Mr. Bussell's " Christian Theology and 
Social Progress " is the ripe fruit of prolongetl 
reflection and often learned investigation. All 
the great pioneers of philosophy, down to the 
most recent, are made to yield their contribu- 
tions to the solution of the ethical and religious 
problems of our age. The central thought of the 
work seems to be that social progress is without 
a rational goal and an adequate inspiration if it 
is not under the guidance and influence of the 
Christian religion. The author says : " It is my 
aim to show how general welfare is bound up 
with the faiths and hopes of Christian belief ; 
and again, how the general welfere can only 
rightly be secured by justice to the particular, 
by resj)ecting the units which make up the whole ; 
a heap composed of valueless atoms is itself with- 
out value." It is the same question raised by 
Tennyson when he asked if one can really re- 
main enthusiastic and make sacrifices for the 
life of a worm or a fly. 

It is a striking proof of the freedom of modem 
science that an honored professor in an orthodox 
theological seminary, endowed by millionaires, 
should retain his place and his honors after 
publishing a plea for socialism, or something 
very like it. The author of " Christianity and 
the Social Crisis " is a teacher of church history, 
and the historical argument for a social theology 
is the best part of his book. Next to this in

value is his honest and searching exposure of the 
inconsistencies between ecclesiastical conduct 
and teaching and the fundamental ideas of the 
Christian religion. Of less value is the later 
and constructive part of the work, where an 
attempt is made to outline the immediate meas- 
ures which should be taken to mitigate the evils 
of our time ; for nothing more than palliatives 
can be expected until a radical revolution in 
government has displaced the present political 
organization of society. Such questions cannot 
be successfidly treated in the form of rhetorical 
appeals to somewhat vague and elementary 
feelings, and without a mastery of teclmical 
economic reasoning which is not revealed in 
the woi'k itself. 

When we grow weary of writers who flatter 
the class of " happy possessors," weary of eco- 
nomic orthodoxy, weary of monotonous praises 
of patriotism and law, we may refresh ourselves 
at the pungent and acid spring of anarchistic 
communism. Under the stimiUating influence 
of such a work as Kropotkin's " Conquest of 
Bread," we seem to be living in a world of 
madmen, and the air about us is full of fanciful 
images, roots in the air, white mourning goods, 
black vests at weddings, men with long hair, 
women with heads cropped and bald. Yet 
Kropotkin is not a lunatic ; he is a close 
reasoner, a leai*ned traveller, a keen observer, 
and he brings into brilliant light uninterpreted 
truths. Reject his extreme individualism if 
you will ; but you must admit that human 
society might be better, and that voluntary 
organization effects more than we credit to its 
account. The State is not all. Even manual 
work, now associated with inferior social posi- 
tion and inhuman conditions, may be made 
attractive to rational men seeking happiness. 
This new edition of " The Conquest of Bread," 
issued by a publishing house of the conservative 
type, is a sign of the times, an evidence that we 
rather prefer to face all possible suggestions, 
however heretical, and let discussion and reflec- 
tion and stern experience sift the chaff from 
the wheat. Those who confuse anarchism with 
socialism may learn from Krojwtkin that these 
are antagonistic theories, — perhaps ignorant 
armies clashing in the night. Wild as may 
seem the speculation, the accoimt of the possi- 
bilities of scientific agriculture and the doctrine 
that social science is " the study of the needs 
of man and the means of satisfying them " will 
justly provoke fresh reflection and open new 
vistas. 

With the kindest intentions, it is difficult 



to do justice to a book like " Gillette's Social 
Redemption " as interpreted by Mr. Severy. 
The .volume is bulky and has been compiled 
with great industry. Sensational " stories " from 
daily newspapers, even of the " yellow " type, 
are seriously treated as historical materials, 
without rational criticism. All the muckrakers 
are here invited to unloatl their misavory bur- 
dens, and the resiJt is a sort of literary dumping- 
ground. Doubtless many of the evils here 
described really exist, and ought to be made 
known ; but we also need some constructive 
suggestions. Near the close (p. 752), in the 
appendix, the author finally hints at a great 
discovery, a huge dream which will occupy 
another tome. " The new system proposes to 
bring about the amelioration of the race by 
organizing a world-wide corporation, with an 
unlimited, elastic, and constantly self-adjusting 
capitalization — a capitalization which shall 
always represent the exact amount of the cor- 
poi-ate assets, falling as they fall, rising as they 
rise." This corporation is to purchase and 
control all means for the production of wealth 
throughout the world. The curious and cour- 
ageous reader wUl find in the book more of the 
same kind of reasoning.

as to afford a high degree of intellectual satisfaction. 
It tells a semi-tragic story of English pro\-inL-ial life, 
and its thesis (for it is a work of marked tendency) 
is that a g^ood woman, by virtue of her very gjood- 
neas, may work the most abominable mischief. The 
title of the book is ironical, for the woman in ques- 
tion, so far from being a helpmate to her husband, 
deals with him in such exasperating fashion that 
she drives him into the immorality of a clandestine 
establishment. It seems to be the author's intention 
to condone this lapse, and throw all the responsi- 
bflity upon the •* spiritual voluptuary " to whom he 
is wedded, which attitode results in a certain con- 
fusion of moral values. We are constantly assured, 
in set terms, that he is essentially a good man — 
one of the best of men — and this assurance, despite 
tJie clearness of his grievance, we cannot discover 
to be borne out by any interpretation of character 
based upon his conduct. As a matter of fact, he 
is exhibited to us as the ho)nme sensuel may en, 
capable enough of negative goo<lness, bat too easy- 
going and weak of will to arouse in us any deeper 
form of sj-mpathy than a mild and qualified pity. 
The wife forgives him, but in a superior sort of 
way, and what he wants is not so much forgiveness 
as wifely affection. He is constitutionally incapable 
of sinking to the depth of abasement which, in her 
opinion, ought to be his spiritual level, and it seems 
to him that to live a clean life henceforth is the 
only comfortable and sane way of atoning for his 
past missteps. This, however, is not her affair, and 
because he will not, of his own motion, remain for- 
ever plunged in black gulfs of remorse for her mor- 
bid satisfaction, she thinks that she must make his 
life miserable by the means that are still within 
her reach. In this she is entirely successful, and, 
although the book closes with the prospect of a new 
dawn of hope for his blighted life, it is difficult for 
us to believe tliat the old estrangement will not soon 
recur. The book is certainly a remarkable study 
of the marital relation, although in a ease excep- 
tional rather than tj-picaL It is extremely plain- 
spoken at times, but not in a way that should offend 
a healthy mind. 

"Growth," by Miss Margaret Todd, is a novel 
difficult to describe in terms that shall convey an 
adequate idea of its remarkable qualities. The title 
is unpromising, to begin with, and yet it is exactly 
the right title for a book that records the develop- 
ment of its characters, and makes us know them by 
showing us how they react to their environment. 
The substance of the book is verj- largely religious 
discussion, embracing types of thought as far re- 
moved from one another as Scotch Presbyterianism 
and the faith of Some. This, again, seems far from 
a recommendation of the book to the interests of 
novel-readers. And yet without this feature, the 
storj- simply could not have been brought into exist- 
ence. We can promise those who are not repelled 
at the outset by these forbidding considerations that 
they will find in them no cause of serious offence. 
In half a dozen instances at least. Miss Todd has 



achieved veritable triumphs of characterization ; she 
has created actual persons into whose lives we enter 
with the deepest sympathy. Xor is a storj' wanting, 
although it is a story which makes its essential ap- 
peal to the cultivated intelligence, and is devoid of 
sensational happenings. The scene is Edinburgh, 
for the most part, varied by excursions to country 
places, to Italy, and even to Portugal. The men are , 
mostly theologfical students, ministers, and priests^ 
although one layman, a physician, plays an im- 
portant part. Of the women, one is a settlement 
worker with medical training, another, her sister, is 
a worldling zealous in the interests of the Catholic 
church, still another is an actress who becomes cele- 
brated in the course of the story. And out of all 
this diverse material we get a picture of human life 
that grows fairly absorbing in its interest as we 
proceed, a dramatic structure in which the claims of 
both spirit and sense are allowed, a residual philos- 
ophy that is shaped to fine intellectnal issues, yet 
which keeps all the time in close contact with the 
world of practical affairs. 

" The Successor," by Mr. Richard Pryce. is an 
English novel three years old. although now pub- 
lished in this country for the first time. It con- 
cerns the desire of Lord Alton de Merringham for 
an heir to whom his estate may descend. He has 
already buried two wives when the story opens, and 
is married to a third, who remains childless, like her 
predecessors. Failing a direct heir, the estate must 
go to a nephew, a nice enough boy, but one whose 
mother is so ambitious for her son that she is de- 
plorably lacking in tact in suggesting Ids claims 
upon her kinsman. In this situation the third Lady 
Alton has an idea. It is an idea so audaciously im- 
moral that even a modern novelist would not dare 
to put it in plain terms, and we come no nearer to 
a statement in the present instance than the decla- 
ration of one of the characters that he has "such a 
little storj- to tell of silence and mystery and the 
night as Boccaccio, at one end of the line of story- 
tellers, or de Maupassant at the other, would have 
rejoiced to find to his pen." What the story is we 
learn by indirection, and imperfecdy at that as the 
plot is worked out- Presently Lord Alton dies^ 
r^retful at losing his hold upon life, but maliciously- 
happy in the knowledge that a chUd will soon be 
bom to bear his name. The rest of the stor)' deals 
with the growth of this child to womanhood, the sin- 
g^ular efforts of her mother to appease an awakened 
conscience, and the final righting by his marriage 
with the heiress of the wrong that had been done 
the nephew. However venturesome the foundation 
of its plot, this book cannot be charged with gross- 
ness ; it handles a situation that is, to put it mildly, 
a difficidt one, with both delicacy and distinction of 
treatment. Its spirit is that of comedy clinging to the 
skirts of tragedy, and its method has been learned 
in the school of Mr. Henrj- James. The seasoned 
reader will get from it no great harm, but much 
delightful entertainment The immature reader will 
do just as well not to make its acquaintance.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



For the second time, if memory serves, Mr. John 
Oxenham has found a setting for a novel in the 
Channel Islands. " A Man of Sark " tells, in the 
first person, of the adventures of a sturdy youth 
who seeks his fortunes as a privateer diu-ing the 
Napoleonic wars. Although loyal to England, he 
is mistaken for a Frenchman after an exciting 
» engagement, and his English captors take him to a 
prison stockade by the North Sea. When he escapes 
and finds his way back to Sark, he is welcomed as 
one from the dead. He is also just in time to rescue 
the maiden whom he has loved all his life from 
the hands of certain villainous persons who have 
abducted her. This is only a small part of the whole 
story, which begins with the hero's childhood, but 
it is the dramatic climax. The author has evidently 
steeped himself in the history, the folk-lore, and the 
«ustom8 of the island folk whom he describes, and 
tells a tale that is deeply appealing and full of varied 
interest. 

We approach Mr. Conrad's " The Secret Agent " 
with anticipations that are not fulfilled. Its pro- 
gramme of anarchists and bombs and detectives 
promises lively entertainment, but we get instead 
interminable descriptions and discussions of motive. 
The result is a good story completely smothered by 
analysis. Both analysis and characterization are 
exceedingly acute, for few men are Mr. Conrad's 
equals in command of the incisive touch and the 
illuminating phrase. But a novel upon such a 
theme as this calls for action, and again action, and 
of this we get next to nothing. We hardly recall an 
equal disappointment since reading " The Princess 
Casamassima." If the reader will make up his 
mind beforehand to look for nothing but psycho- 
logical interest, he will find it a-plenty. But the 
natural man in him must be prepared for shocks. 
He will be expected to remain unchafed while a 
dramatic conversation is indefinitely suspended until 
the author has freed his own capacious mind at great 
length, and, when the anarchist outrage which is the 
climax of the story actually comes off, he will be 
expected to hark back, and toil laboriously up to the 
climax a second time. These things are exasperat- 
ing, of course, but they are inseparable from Mr. 
Conrad's way of working, and those who have read 
his other books are faii-ly forewarned. In compari- 
son with the bulk of this narrative, its grim closing 
chapters have an unexpected directness and concen- 
tration. 

Again, in " Winston of the Prairie," as recently in 
" The Dust of Conflict," Mr. Harold Bindloss pre- 
sents us with a hero who is under unjust suspicion 
of murder, and who, in consequence, seeks new sur- 
roundings and adopts a new name. Again, also, 
•despite the suspicion attaching to him, he wins the 
love of a girl who is conquered by his sheer manli- 
ness, and whose faith in him remains unshaken by 
false report. Here the similarity ends, for the new 
novel takes us, not to Cuba, but to the Canadian 
Northwest, with which country the author showed 
us his familiarity in " Alton of Somasco." The tale 



is a vigorous one, mostly about people with red 
blood in their veins, and it has a skilfully-contrived 
plot. The hero's impersonation of another man; 
leads to exciting complications, and it is difficult to 
see how he is going to extricate himself from the 
false position in which he is placed. But his ser- 
vices to the little farming community, which he 
teaches to win prosperity out of seeming disaster, 
are so substantial that when the hour of disentangle- 
ment comes, he both clears his name and finds con- 
donation for his deception. In the wheat-raising 
region of Western Canada, Mr. Bindloss has found 
a field almost as virgin to the novelist as to the 
agriculturist, and so subdued it to his purposes that 
his work will not easily be matched. We cannot 
help noting one persistent peculiarity of his diction — 
the use of the word '' doUai's " where " money " 
would be the natural word to employ. Is this idio- 
matic to the country of which he writes ? We have 
noticed it frequently in all three of the novels above 
named, and it gives us a slight shock every time it 
occurs. 

The ingenious author of " The Cat and the 
Cherub " has given us a full-fledged novel in *' John 
Kendry's Idea." It is a California novel, and it 
has much to do with Chinatown and its denizens 
with ways that are dark. There is a particularly 
picturesque old scoundrel named Chan Kow who, 
when things get too hot for him, contrives his own 
taking-off (by means of a substitute), and departs 
for Paris to enjoy his deviously-gotten wealth. This 
obese compound of philanthropy and villainy is an 
adept in disguises, and we never know under what 
name or in what form he will next appear. He ex- 
ploits his fellow-countrymen, whom he calls cochons 
de Chinois, and takes care to gi'atify all his private 
revenges before he takes his leave from the scene. 
His connection with the story comes from his friend- 
ship for the hero, to whose father he had owed his 
start in business, and from his knowledge of the opera- 
tions of a gang of counterfeiters, whom the hero is 
bent upon unearthing. The motive of this quest is 
supplied by his interest in a young woman, who is 
involved with the counterfeiters in some unexplained 
fashion. John's Idea is a vague one of doing some- 
thing for the benefit of mankind — of becoming " a 
part of the whole Continuous Performance." But 
it is too indefinite to interest us until it finds con- 
crete embodiment in the heroine, from which time 
on the story itself is a continuous performance, ex- 
cept for certain long-winded passages of analytical 
philosophy that the judicious reader will skip. It 
is a story of many startling surprises ; in fact, there 
is an ambush upon nearly every page ; that anything 
like it ever happened, or could happen, we greatly 
doubt, but that does not prevent its being a highly 
readable melodrama, with a style that comes near to 
exhibiting distinction. 

Reading " The Younger Set," by Mr. Robert W. 
Chambers, we are compelled to repeat what we said 
of "The Fighting Chance," — that the author has 
been ill-advised to desert the field of historical and

fantastic romance for the field of modern realism. 
He is much more interesting when he deals with 
Revolutionary scenes and characters than when he 
deals with the undesirable citizens who live in our 
modern fashionable society, and who constitute noth- 
ing more than the scum upon the surface of our real 
civilization. The " younger set " as he describes it, 
and as we know it only too well from journalistic 
report, seems to be devoid of both manners and 
ideals, and its existence would be difficult to justify 
upon any grounds. Of course, Jlr. Chambers, in 
his capacity of clironicler and satirist, ostensibly 
shares this view, but we cannot help feeling that he 
is no less anxious to exhibit his intimate familiarity 
with the ways of ''smart " people than he is to scourge 
their follies and expose the vacuity of their life. The 
treatment is marred by the note of insincerity, and 
the virtuous types that the author contrasts with the 
vicious ones are too unreal to be taken seriously. 
The hero is too preposterously goo<l, and the heroine, 
adorable though she be, is too nearly impossible as 
a product of such surroundings. She is like the 
pure water-lily blossoming upon the surface of the 
foul waters, but the simile is too pretty to be true. 
The story has many elements of popularity, and will 
probably attract a large public. Its meloth-amatic 
contrasts and episodes, the sentiment with which it 
reeks, the up-to-date jargon of its conversations, and 
the general animation which pervades it, are quali- 
ties tliat appeal strongly to the average reader of 
fiction. It has, besieges, certain elemtnts of positive 
excellence, such as constructive art, poetical elegance 
of diction, and a sympathetic touch. The author 
is particularly happy in writing about children, and 
his little girl of twelve or fourteen is so natural and 
withal so winsome a creation that we are inclined 
to think of her as the most successful of his char- 
acters. 

Mr. Leroy Scott's " To Him That Hath " is an 
unusually striking and effective novel. It is basetl 
upon a principle of casuistry that no clear-sighted 
person could justify, and it involves a self-sacrifice 
that is, calmly considered, preposterous, but, given 
these questionable conditions, the story is invested 
with absorbing interest. The hero, placed in charge 
of the affairs of the Rev. Philip Morton, heatl of St. 
Christopher's Mission in the slum reg^ions of New 
York, suddenly deceased, discovers that his friend, 
reputed a saint, has really conmiitted suicide to escape 
the consequences of an embezzlement of the mission 
funds. David Aldrich, the hero in question, is 
appalled at the thought of an exposure, and of the 
blow that it would deal to Morton's devoted followers, 
reclaimed from evil by what has seemed to be the 
example of his devoted life. He takes the bm-den of 
the crime upon liis own shoulders, and suffers the 
penalty of the law, which means a prison term of 
several years. AH this is hurried over in a few open- 
ing pages. The substance of the story is found in 
David's efforts to earn a living after his release, in 
his struggle with the extreme of poverty and 
wretchedness, and in his desperate devices to pre- 



serve the secret which has made him an outcast and 
left the memory of his dead fi-iend enshrined. The 
heroine, who is the daughter of one of these pluto- 
crats whom our novelists delight in holding up to 
contumely, has loved David before his disgrace, and 
after his release from prison tries to aid him in the 
rehabilitation of his character. In a deeply impres- 
sive scene, she at last discovei-s the truth about him, 
and is ovenvhelmed by compassion at the thought of 
his long martyrdom. At the same time her ej-es are 
opened concerning the sources of her father's wealth : 
she leaves her luxurious home, and becomes Da'S'id's 
wife, accepting all the obloquy for the sake of her 
love. The plot of the novel is forced, as we have 
seen, and the action is over-melodramatic, but it is a 
particularly striking production for all that, and its 
essential pathos is relieved by much subsidiary inci- 
dent, and even by touches of genuine humor. 

It was inevitable that the insurance scandals of 
two years ago should sooner or later furnish the 
enterprising novelist with materials for a tale. Mr. 
David Graham Phillips is the one who has seized 
the opportunity, and his production is entitled 
" Light-fingered Gentry." The easy-going methods 
of the insurance coi"porations, as revealed in the 
Hughes investigation, are effectively exploit«d. as 
well as the corrupt alliance of political with finan- 
cial interests whereby the system was so strength- 
ened that it seemed impregnable to attack. In the 
case of the novel, matters do not come to the point 
of public exposure, for the hero is not an eloquent 
district attorney, but merely an officer of one of the 
companies, whose interests are best served by its 
reorganization upon a relatively honest basis of 
dealing with the public. Mr. Phillips is well ac- 
quainted with the ins and outs of his subject, but 
his portrayal of conditions is marked by a stronger 
bias against the methods of the companies than the 
facts would be likely to justify. Still, considering 
the possibilities of sensationalism inherent in the 
theme, he has avoided the extremer forms of over- 
statement. The private interest of the story is 
inconsiderable. The chief magnate has a daughter, 
who in due course discovers that her father is not 
tlie humane and upright pei-son she has hitherto 
believed him to be. This is a frequently-worked 
situation, but in the present case, the young woman 
in question is not the real heroine. That place is 
filled by the hero's wife, whom he divorces early in 
the narrative, and long afterwards, when the rich 
possibilities of her nature are revealed to hini, he 
seeks to win once more. Thb reawakened love 
proves doubly his salvation, for it not only restores 
his domestic happiness, but also works in him a 
moral regeneration which bears fruit in the conduct 
of the business which is at last brought under his 



control.

La,t ,iudie, The news of the death of Sir Spencer 
of an English Walpole camelast summer as a shock 
scholar. ^^ j-jjg readers of his historical writ- 

ings. His judgments were those of a man of large 
experience in public affairs. He had a sure and 
penetrating glance beyond the threshold of person- 
ality, and could estimate the forces which led to 
great decisions. From his writings one would infer 
that he had the saving grace of humor, and that 
other grace, akin to it, of genial appreciation of 
those with whose principles of action he could not 
agree. The loss of a man of such qualities of mind 
seems intimate and irreparable. The regret wiU 
be increased by the reading of his " Studies in 
Biography" (Button), which was published earlier 
in the year. Several of these essays have already 
appeared in English reviews. With the exception 
of two (one on Prince Bismarck, another on 
Napoleon III.), they relate to Englishmen — Sir 
Robert Peel, Mr. Cobden, Lord Dufferin, Edward 
Gibbon, Mr. Disraeli, and Lord Shaftesbury. There 
is also an essay on " Some Decisive Marriages of 
English History." Sir Spencer distributes his judg- 
ments as he moves along. In the case of Bismarck 
and Napoleon III., if not of Disraeli, he uses some 
hard words. One may be inclined to feel, for 
example, that he gives the famous " blood and iron " 
speech a setting unnecessarily ugly. With Bismarck 
this was not a dogma of political action, but, rather, 
an inference from past experience. Other men have 
sought ends which have implied as much bloodshed, 
but have avoided the odium of declaring frankly 
where it all led to. One reads with greater relish 
the essays on the Englishmen. These do not pre- 
sent matter which is new to readers of the author's 
other books, but they emphasize the personal side 
and introduce nmch that would be irrelevant in 
the ordinary historicixl narrative. In the essay on 
Disraeli he reaffirms the opinion which he expressed 
a few years ago in his "History of Twenty-five 
Years," — namely, that Disraeli " had few deep 
convictions on the political questions which came 
before him from time to time . . . and he was so 
intent on the tactics of the political campaign, that 
he had hardly time to think on the subjects for 
which he was struggling." It should be added that 
the reader receives from all these essays an impres- 
sion as stimulating as if he had had a quiet and 
illuminating conversation with a man of wide obser- 
vation and fruitful reflection. 



Vo„r centuries '^^- T- H. S. Escott has twice before 
of English proved himself an astute observer

porary social conditions in England. His latest 
book, "Society in the Country House" (Jacobs), 
is an intimate, gossippy chronicle of the history of 
some of the great English estates, particularly those 
in the southern counties. A trenchant introductory 
chapter explains the fourteenth-century origin of 



the country house, sketches its rise to the height of 
its power in Tudor times, when its political and 
social functions had become fully developed, and 
shows how, now as then, its influence is strong and 
its place in the structure of English society assured. 
In sixteen lengthy chapters Mr. Escott conducts his 
readers to as many gi-oups of country houses, tracing 
the rise of each great family, characterizing its most 
interesting representatives and most famous visitors, 
drawing upon a store of racy anecdote and curious 
legend, and fully substantiating his claim that the 
country house has associations with the spiritual, 
literary, and social movements of the nation, which 
are even stronger than those more pictm'esque and 
popularly recognized bonds which unite it with the 
chase, the turf, and the stage. Mr. Escott pursues 
his subject with a leisurely thoroughness that is 
characteristically British, but his style is crisp and 
nervous enough to hold the reader's interest. Here 
is his characterization of the eleventh duke of 
Norfolk, known among his intimates as the 
" Jockey," and famous for his large hospitality : 
" A shrewd, tolerably read, voluble man, with a 
smattering of literature and science that passed, in 
a duke, for learning, he said some clever things, 
about Ireland in particular, but more that were 
merely coarse, on all subjects in general." Mr. 
Escott is an expert gatherer of bon mots, such as 
Balfour's description, given at a Battle house-party 
in 1881, of Disraeli's conversation, — "A brazen 
mask talking l|is own novels," — or the Evangelical 
Mrs. Sargent's partisan denimciation of Newman 
as " a confirmed old Papist." The Pembrokes, the 
Stanhopes, Byron, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Horace 
Walpole are a few of the names that Mr. Escott 
mentions most often ; but one merit of his book is 
its avoidance of monopolies, whether exercised by 
persons or periods. An index to proper names 
rendei-s Mr. Escott's mass of material available for 
hasty consultation.

at such clandestine love affairs as this is well illus- 
trated by the following editorial paragraph : " Must 
one always smile in hearing a liaison spoken of, or 
regret the indiscretion committed when the details 
are published ? A love that weakens, and sometimes, 
alas ! destroys genius, should be punished by oblivion ; 
but there is another love that is worthy to live by 
remembrance, because without it, perhaps, genius 
would not have flown so high. It is a necessity with 
some natures, to find beings whose intelligent under- 
standing permits them to pour forth their over-full 
souls. To bow to convention, to restrain an un- 
quenched thirst for happiness, is sometimes more 
fatal to genius than to give way to its inclinations." 
These letters of Mme. de Sta6l, with their frefjuent 
references to current events, have some historical as 
well as biographical interest, but are perliaps not 
quite so important or interesting as the Baroness de 
Nolde would have us believe. The translation is a

and the Engiifh our greatest poets are inaccessible 
lake dutrtci. creatures who stand quietly aloof, 
well content to let the busy world do without theii- 
messages, if the busy world so elects. This is the 
situation which Mrs. Anna Benneson McMahan's 
skilfully edited antliology, " With Wordsworth in 
England" (McClurg), endeavors to grapple with. 
Mrs. McMahan refers, in her introduction, to the 
natural desire of Wordsworth's admirers, when trav- 
elling through the regions he has immortalized, to 
identify the actual spots mentioned in the poems. 
" The attempt to do so from the top of a coach," 
she adds, " with a copy of ' The Excursion ' in hand, 
is a familiar sight in the Lake District of England. 
The result is a failure both geographically and poet- 
ically." It was Professor Knight who, twenty years 
ago, suggested the publication in one volume of 
the poems of Wordsworth containing allusions to 
the Lake Country. Mrs. McMahan has enlarged the 
plan to include a few poems connected with the 
poet's early life in Somersetshire, and some of 
Wordsworth's letters, as well as a few of Dorothy 
Wordsworth's. She has also provided a comple- 
ment of over sixty very beautiful illustrations, 
which the publishers have had skilfully reproduced. 
These will recall to the tourist the places that he 
saw from the coach-top, and they will help the less 
travelled reader to realize the almost magical charm 
of Wordsworth's environment. Liist but not least, 
Mrs. McMahan has written a general introduc- 
tion, intended to disann popular prejudice against 
Wordsworth's self-centred austerity by emphasiz- 
ing the more winning side of his personality, and 
also a special introduction for each of the four 
groups into which she has di\-ided the poems and 
letters. These prefator}- notes are verj' brief, and 
contain chiefly significant biographical items culled 
from memoirs not likely to come within the ken of 
the busy "general reader." Mrs. McMahan has 
already proved herself, — as editor of " Florence in

Mr. Francis Coutts presents in " The 
Heresy of Job " ( John Lane Co. ) 
an attractive and useful volume con- 
taining, first, introductorj' matter explaining the 
editor's conception of the poem's purpose and mean- 
ing ; second, the poem itself divided into three 
parts. Prologue, Debate, and EpUogue ; third, some 
pages of notes elucidating certain obscurities in the 
text ; fourth, an appendix containing the speech of 
Elihu the Buzite, which the editor regards as an in- 
terpolation ; fifth, a list of commentaries consulted : 
and, finally, the "Illustrations of the Book of Job, 
Invented and Engraved by William Blake," and 
fii-st published in 1825, by Blake himself. Job's 
"heresy" consisted not in a denial oi Gtod or a 
rejection of religion, but rather in a refusal to sub- 
scribe to the smug orthodoxy of his three friends, 
Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, — a refusal that finds 
itself amply justified in what the editor entitles 
"The Epilogue," being tlie last eleven verses of the 
book. Epilogue and Prologue are printed in prose 
form ; the Debate, or body of the poem, being ar- 
ranged metrically. Worthy of note is the variety 
of ways in which this work has been classified by 
its various admirers. Mr. John Owen, in his book 
on "The Five Great Skeptical Dramas of Hbtory," 
brackets it with the " Prometheus Bound," " Faust," 
" Hamlet," and " El Magico Prodigfioso," as a drama. 
Mr. Chesterton has written an essay upon it as an 
epic poem — a tribal epic, if we remember rightly. 
And now, following somewhat in his footsteps, Mr, 
Coutts calls it " one of the gfrandest epic utterances 
ever given to the world." The reader may find 
it worth while, incidentally, to look up Professor 
Jastrow's recent ai-ticle on a Babylonian forerunner, 
or archetype, of our biblical Job. The Hebrew 
poet to whose genius we owe the latter is supposed 
to have lived, in the period following the return 
from Babylon.

London," " Roads into London," " \Vork in London," 
and " Rest in London." Inviting as these chapter- 
heads are, the reader will not obtain from a perusal 
of the subject-matter as much information as he is 
likely to expect. It will give him, however, a use- 
ful and fairly accurate picture of London as it im- 
presses one to-day, — of London, the ever-growing, 
all-absorbing city democracy that inspires the admira-

purpose will feel no little disappointment that the 
" interpretation " is not more interpretative. The

extraordinary rapidity, and presenting problems of 
unusual complexity, from the data of a more or less 
casual visit. At the same time he very properly 
contends that the intelligent onlooker lias the advan- 
tage over the native of a broader and more detached 
point of view. He wUl, of course, "■ miss all the 
finer texture of the spirit and life of the people, 
will learn very little of their domestic life or the 
subtler psychology that underlies their social and 
religious institutions : he will make some false 
generalizations by imperfect induction, some abso- 
lute errors of observation or of record, upon which 
critics will rightly fasten for the harrying process 
which they profess." Mr. Hobson thus shrewdly 
disarms the well-meaning reviewer. It may be said, 
however, with strict impartiality, that in the main 
he has handled such questions as the so-called 
Americanization of Canada, British Columbian 
problems, the immigi-ation policy of the country, 
the French in Canada, the Colonial preference, etc., 
with fairness and more than a measure of intelli- 
gence. A large portion of the book is devoted to a 
discussion of Canada's fiscal policy, past, present, 
and prospective. While Mr. Hobson's views on 
fiscal questions are somewhat discounted by his atti- 
tude ( that of the typical Britisli free-trader ) of com- 
plaisant incredulity as touching the possibility of 
merit in any other fiscal system, his analysis of the 



Canadian tariffs and their influence upon the growth 
of Canada's trade with Great Britain and the United 
States, respectively, is a valuable addition to the 
literature of the subject. 



Thf reiolt of

How can it be right, how is it even 
possible, for us to enjoy life and to 
take delight in literature and art, 
when millions of our fellow-beings are starving and 
other tens of millions are only keeping the wolf 
from the door by a dreary and desperate struggle of 
lifelong duration? This question cannot but present 
itself to the reader of Mr. Charles Edward Russell's 
social and economic studies entitled "The Uprising of 
the Many " ( Doubleday). These chapters, largely a 
republication of material that has already appeared 
in " Everybody's Magazine," form a powerful in- 
dictment against the shameless greed of "vested 
interests," and exhibit om* own country as tolerating, 
constitutionally, legally, and by tacit consent, some 
1 of the most outrageous injustices in the history of the 
world. The author has travelled widely, and with 
his eyes open ; and while he brings from India, with 
her famines and plagues and other preventable ills 
of the most grievous sort, an account of social con- 
ditions that goes some way toward reconciling an 
i American to his own happier lot, the description 
of certain excellent features in the government of 
j Switzerland and in the young commonwealths of 
i Australia and New Zealand, with detailed pictures 
j of the seemingly excellent working of governmentr 
! owned railways and other public utilities, almost 
inspires a longing to emigrate. The book tends to 
convince one, among other things, that there may 
be something of profound wisdoni in President 
Woodrow Wilson's recent suggestion that we need 
a new constitution adapted to the new conditions. 
It is rather strange that Mr. Russell's wide-ranging 
travels and studies failed to include Russia ; but his 
book is rich in instructive matter as it is.

Few subjects are so unfailingly inter- 
esting to aD sorts and conditions of 
readers as the subject of hygiene — 
as the quack-medicine advertiser well knows. But 
the book now under review is not the production 
of a quack. Dr. Norman Bridge's " House Health, 
and Other Papers" (Duftield) contains much good 
advice, and some that is perhaps not so good be- 
cause the counsel of an extremist. The exchange 
of children he seriously urges as a remedy for 
evils arising from incompatibility of temperament, 
thus making light of the sacredness of filial and 
parental bonds. He also recommends the transfer 
of children from parents who for any reason feel 
offspring to be a burden, to childless couples whose 
happiness is incomplete for the lack of offspring. 
The virtue of ventilation and of out-door life finds 
an ardent advocate in Dr. Bridge : but to maintain 
that houses full of cracks and crannies make excel- 
lent homes because sure to be well ventilated, is 
going to extremes, as perhaps also his advising us

to sleep with a draught Wowing across the l)ed and 
never to fear catching cold from an inrush of pure 
air. But the fresh-air doctrine can hardly do harm 
even when preached in this radical form. The 
abomination of stuffy living rooms and unventilated 
assembly halls contributes much to the unenjorment 
of life, to put it mildly. One point, in closing, to 
poor sleepers. If noises keep you awake, take a 
small lump of paraffin, warm it in the mouth, chew- 
ing it, perhaps, to soften it, and apply it as a stopper 
to the ear — a morsel to each ear. It is said to be 
effective, not disagreeable, and easUy removed. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Measrs. Thomas T. Crowell & Co. are the publishers 
of a series of six volumes, collectively entitled " Pioneers 
in Education," and written by M. Gabriel Compayr^. 
The subjects of the volumes are as follows: "Jean 
JaeqsM Bonaseau and Education from Nature, " " Her- 
bert Spencer and Scientific Education." " Pestalorzi and 
Elementary Education," " Herbart and Education by 
Instmction,^ " Montaigne and Education of the Judg- 
ment," and " Horace Mami and the PubUc School in the 
United States." The tnnslatioos oi these volumes are 
by various hands. 

Professor Hugo P. Thieme's " Guide Bibliographique 
de la Litt^rature Fran?aise de 1800 k 190C" (Paris: 
H. Welter) is a work that represents an enormous labor 
on the part of the compiler. There are upwards of 
five hundred large double-c-olumned pages of fine print, 
giving ns complete list£ of the publications of nearly a 
thousand authors, with dates and publishers, and, with 
each author of any importance, a bibliography of criti- 
cal referenees, based upon both books and periodicals. 
More than eight thousand volumes of periodical liter- 
atnre have been searched for these references, and this 
represent* only a part of the editor's labors. Many a 
student will arise to eall him blessed for thus coUectiug 
this mass of bibliographical material, and classifying it 
for ready use. 

.\ new edition of " Stars of the Opera," by Miss 
Mabel Wagnalls, Ls published by the Funk & Wagnalls 
Co. It is a volume of sketches, based upon personal 
interviews with tome of our best-known operatic singers, 
while between these interviews are interspersed sketches 
of the operas with which these artists are chietiy iden- 
tified. There are many illustrations. A 8ee<md series 
of Miss Gladys Davidson's "Stories from the Operas" 
is published by the J. B. lippincott Co. This volume 
contains also biographical sketches and has portrait illus- 
trations. " The Wagner Stories," by Mr. Filson Young, 
is a descriptive work, varied by bits of lyric, and all 
verv agreeably put together. It is published bv Messrs. 
McClure, Phillips & Co. 

Anyone wishing to buUd, remodel, or decorate a 
house, or to plan a suitable garden for it, can find some- 
thing suggestive and to his purpose in Mr. William 
Herbert'sbook of architectural studies,reprinted from the 
"Architectural Record" under the title "Housesfor Town 
or Country " (Duifield ). The book is la\ishly illustrated, 
with a view both to making details plaiuer and to prov- 
ing the author's main contention, namely: that Ameri- 
can architecture, after pursuing its course through the 



devious errors of heterogeneous imitation, has entered 
upon a renaissanee and has already acquired a certain 
distinctive and national quality, artistic because appro- 
priate to our climate and modes of living. Mr. Herbert 
discusses typical town and country houses and the house 
for all the year, both in general and in detail. " The 
American Coimtry Estate " and " The House in Rela- 
tion to Out-of-Doors " are two suggestive titles to the 
would-be landscape gardener, and a concluding chapter 
on " New Uses of Old Forms " contains some interesting 
theories about original effects, good and bad. 

The twenty-first volume of " Book-Prices Current " 
(London: Elliot Stock) has come to hand. It con- 
tains a very full report of nearly sixty books-sales held 
in London during the season of 1906-1907. Care has 
been taken to omit nothing important, irrespective of 
the prices realized, and to make the index especially 
complete and convenient. Tlie sales of the libraries of 
Mr. Van Antwerp of New York and of the Duke of 
Sutherland were of exceptional interest, and full reports 
of these and other very important sales, with the neea- 
sarv descriptions and notes, have made the current 
volume a little larger than usual. The unusually high 
average price for the year is accounted for by the record 
sums realized for a few highly prized works, such as the 
Kilmamock edition of Bums's poems, which brought 
£700; Shakespeare's first fobo, 1623, 13,600; Walton's 
"Compleat Angler," 1653, £1,290: and. among the 
manuscripts, the Shellev Note Books, which sold for 
£3,000. 

The " thin paper " editions of standard authors pub- 
lished by Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. provide 
much good reading in moderate bulk and at a corre- 
spondingly moderate price. We have before us an 
edition of Hugo's novels in eight volumes, including 
" Hans of Iceland " and " Bug Jargal," besides the five 
great works. We have also a ten-volume set of the 
more popular historical romances of Dumas. Sue's 
" The Wandering Jew " makes a two-volume set uni- 
form with the above. These books have tlexible leather 
covers, frontispiece illustrations, and editorial introduc- 
tions. Single-volume works of the same series give us 
the poems of Moore, Mrs. Browning, and Milton, also 
Dante's " New life " and " Divine Comedy " boud 
together (Rossetti and Cary are the translations used). 
Another volume gives us Mr. Barrie's " The Little 
Minister,'" while Beade's " The Cloister and the Hearth " 
furnishes the material for a pretty two-volume set. 

A collection of " Imperial Songs," being poems by 
the Emperor of Japan and other imperial and distin- 
guished personages, reproduced in autog^raph facsimile, 
as well as in English translations by the Rev. A. Lloyd, 
is an interesting volume that comes to us from the 
Kinkodo Publishing Co., Tokyo. Here is a sample 
poem, expressive of one of the many admirable senti- 
ments of His Majesty : 

" The foe that strikes thee for Uur ooontry's sake 
Strike him with all thr micht. 

But while thou strik'st 
Forget not gtill to love him." 

The same translator pves us " The Praises of Amida," 
in a series of seven Buddhist sermons from the Ji^tan- 
ese of Mr. Tada Kanai. This booklet is published at 
Yokohama by Messrs. Kelly and Walsh. One of these 
sermons, we observe, assails " the Devil of Objective 
Compromise " in terms that would have won the appro- 
val of the author of ■' Brand."

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Notes. 



Smollett's "Ti-avels iii France and Italy," and 
Fielding's "Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon," are two 
recent additions to the " World's Classics," published 
by Mr. Henry Frowde. 

A charming set of Richard Jefferies, in three vol- 
umes, is published by the Messrs. Crowell. The books 
included are "Life of the Fields," "Tlie Open Air," 
and "Nature near London." Mr. Thomas Coke Watkiiis 
supplies the introductory editorial matter. 

Six volumes of the " What Is Worth While " series 
of booklets are sent us by the Messi-s. Crowell. " The 
Battle of Life " and " The Good Old Way," two sermons 
by the Rev. Henry van Dyke, are the numbers that 
will be hkely to attract the largest audience. 

Ibsen's " Emperor and Galilean," in a translation based 
in part upon Miss Catherine Ray's vei-sion (published 
in 1876), is now added to Mr. William Archer's new 
edition of Ibsen's plays. The set, which we believe is 
now complete in eleven volumes, is published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Thi-ee pretty booklets published by Messrs, Duffield 
& Co. give us, respectively, the text of the United 
States Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, 
and Washington's Farewell Address. The pages are 
small, with oruameutal borders, and the covers have an 
attractive design. 

Messrs. Little, Bi-own, & Co. now publish a " pocket 
edition " of the principal historical romances of Alex- 
andre Dumas. There are fourteen volimies, with illus- 
trations, and the set may be had in either cloth or 
morocco covers. Similar sets of Hugo and Jane Austen 
are promised for the near future. 

Three attractive booklets from Messrs. Thomas Y. 
Crowell & Co. give us the story of Wagner's " Rhein- 
gold," told in English verse by Mr. Oliver Huckel, an 
essay on " The Idylls and the Ages," by Professor John 
F. Genimg, and a short paper on " Tlie Pure Gold of 
Nineteenth Century Literature," by Professor W. L. 
Phelps. 

"Outlines for Review " in both Greek and Roman 
history are two booklets that teachers of ancient history 
will find useful. They have been prepared by Messrs. 
C. B. Newton and E. B. Treat, and are published by the 
-■American Book Co. From the same publishers we have 
a " Written and Oral Composition," by Professors M. W. 
Sampson and E. V. Holland, and " A Brief History of 
the United States," by Professor J. B. McMaster. 

Two highly acceptable additions to the " Riverside 
Literature Series" of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflm & 
Co are a volume of " Selected Poems of Percy Bysshe 
Shelley," edited by Professor George Herbert Clarke, 
and a selection of " Essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson," 
edited by Miss Mary A. Jordan. Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
pubUsh "Selections from Byron," edited by Professor 
Samuel Marion Tucker, and " Selections from Poe," 
edited by Mr. J. Montgomery Gambrill. The Charles 
E Merrill Co. publish a volume of poems by Coleridge, 
edited by Dr. Julian W. Aberuethy. 

« Grant, Lincoln, and the Freedmen " is the title of 
an interesting volume of reminiscences by the late 
General John Eaton, to be published at once by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. The book touches upon 
many educational and political interests connected with 
General Eaton's career as United States Commissioner 
of Education from 1870 to 1886, but the emphasis is laid 



upon the earlier phases of his work during the Civil 
War when, acting >mder instructions issued by Grant, 
Lincoln, and the War Department, General Eaton took 
charge of the army of refugee negi'oes which flocked 
for protection to the Union forces. This work was 
carried on before the establishment of the Freedmen's 
Bureau, and in the face of difficulties which have never 
adequately been described. 

The Franciscan Fathers at St. Michaels, Arizona, pro- 
pose to publish the Dictionary of the Navajo Language 
upon which they have been engaged for the past ten 
years. The dictionary will contain a series of articles 
on Navajo religion, ceremonies, arts, industries, each to 
be followed by a list of the Navajo terms employed 
therein, with more or less detailed explanation. This 
descriptive text will comprise articles on the industries, 
weaving, dyeing, silver working, basket making, etc. 
In addition, it will contain lists of Navajo names of 
persons and places, star names, names of plants and ani- 
mals. The work may be best described as an ethno- 
logic dictionary. It is proposed to print it at St. 
Michaels, Arizona, and to issue it with the imprint of the 
St. Michaels Press. The edition will be limited to not 
more than 200 numbered copies, of which only 180 will 
be sold. The price will be l^S per copy, payable on 
delivery. Mr. Stewart Culin, of the Brooklyn Museum 
Institute, is deeply interested in the publication of this 
important work, and has undertaken to bring it to the 
attention of scholars. Subscriptions may be sent to him.

ENGLISH POEMS— THE NINETEENTH CENTURY selected .nd edited by 

WALTER C. BRONSON, Litt.D.. Professor of English Literature in Brown Univenit}-. 
This new collection of English poems is in many respects an advance upon any yet produced. The aim has been to 
satisfy- the needs of the student and reader of the present day, and to this end every effort has been made to supply in 
the commentary just the needed information and interpretation. 6j5 pages, ismt, cUtb, library editita, net Sl.JO.

HERALDS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE By annie russell marble. 

Recounts in detailed study and largely from original sources the lives and services of a group of t>-pical writers of the 
Revolutionary- and National periods. There are biographical and critical studies of Francis Hopkinson, Philip 
Freneau, John Trumbull and his friends among the "Hartford wits," Joseph Dennie, William Dunlap, and early play- 
wrights, and Charles Brockden Brown and his contemporaries in fiction. The book is illustrated by several half- 
tones of rare portraits, broadsides, and title-pages. Jl6 pages, small 8vo. cloth; net $1.50, postpaid $1.64. 

WOMEN'S WORK AND WAGES a phase of life in an industrial city. 

By EDW.\RD CADBURY, M. CECILE MATHESON, and GEORGE SHANN. 
A minute and vivid study of the lives of English working women, involving work, wag^, home life, recreation, etc. 
Nothing more striking has ever been published on the subject. The book is admirable in its avoidance of sensadon- 
alism and its evident sincerity of purpose. At the same time the simply told story has a pathos of its own. J^j Pages, 
Si-t, cloth; net $1 .50. postpaid $1.61. 

ADAM SMITH AND MODERN SOCIOLOGY a study in the method- 
ology of THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. By ALBION W. SMALL. 
The volume is the first of a series which the author will edit on the preparations for sociology in the fragmentary work 
of the nineteenth-century social sciences. The main argument of the book is that modem sociology is virtually an 
attempt to take up the larger program of social analysis and interpretation which was implicit in Adam Smith's moral 
philosophy, but which was suppressed for a century by prevailing interest in the technique of the production of wealth. 
It is both a plea for revision of the methods of the social sciences and a sy-mptom of the reconstruction that is already in 
progress. 3^0 pages. l3mo, cloth; net Si -^S' P^'^P""^ ^^-J^-

PROMINENT McCLURE BOOKS 



CThe Publishing Event of the Year 

Reminiscences of Carl Schurz 

Two magnificent volumes, fully illustrated with portraits, contemporary engravings, and original drawings. 

CIt is difficult to recall a work of biography, or in fact any serial published during the past 
decade, that has attracted such keen universal interest or made so strong an appeal to the 
American reader as the Schurz Reminiscences in McClure's Magazine. In these two sumptuous 
volumes, the distinguished memoirs acquire an added dignity and importance, containing as the 
volumes do much new material that is now for the first time printed. The publication marks a 
signally brilliant contribution to American biography and letters. As a vital first-hand impression 
of the great men and events of the past fifty years in American history, by one of our country's 
finest examples of sterling citizenship, the work is an inspiration. It should be found in the 
library of every American home. The first edition is almost entirely subscribed for. 

Now ready. Two volumes. Price, boxed, net, $6.00. Expressage 4^ cts. additional. 

CI,The story of our most famous residence — a fascinating histor)'. 

ESTHER SINGLETON'S Thc White HoUSC 

CFor the first time the true story of this historic building is here presented adequately and accurately. From old 
diaries, old records, old newspapers, and old letters, Miss Singleton has culled the material for a work of the 
utmost fascination for the American reader. The building itself is described from its earliest beginnings ; delight- 
ful and familiar glimpses are afforded of the famous mistresses of the White House, and of all the prominent 
historical figures; the entertainments of all the Presidents are brilliantly detailed. 
Tiuo vols. Fully illustrated luith portraits, rare prints , paintings , etc. Price, net, $4. Expressage 4§c. additional. 

C Notable estimates of some great writers, by the author of " The Torch," etc. 

GEORGE EDWARD wooDBERRY's Great Writers 

C Virgil, Shakespeare, Scott, Cervantes, Montaigne, and Milton, — these are the men whom Professor Woodberry 
has chosen to re-interpret to the modern world. These papers, which have appeared greatly abbreviated in 
McClure's Magazine, are regarded by the author as his most important work of pure criticism. 

Postpaid, $1.32 ; net, $1.20. 



EDWIN J. ELLIS 

The Real Blake 

CMr. Ellis, with William Butler Yates, prepared the 
first full edition of the work of William Blake. In 
the present volume he has succeeded in making a com- 
plete portrait of the man such as has hitherto been lack- 
ing, and such as will be of the greatest value and interest 
to all readers and students of Blake. 

Postpaid, $3.70 ; net, $3.50. 



JULES LEMAJTRE 

Jean Jacques Rousseau 

CThe distinguished French academician has here 
written perhaps the most interesting and suggestive 
appreciation of Rousseau extant. The announcement 
last year that M. Lemaitre would lecture on the citizen 
of Geneva excited the greatest interest throughout France. 
These lectures compose the volume.

Wagner's own works. Postpaid, $1.42 ; net, $1.30.

THREE SPLENDID NOVELS 
Robert W. Chambers THE YOUNGER SET 

Over 800,000 of this author's novels have been sold. This volume started at 100,000. " The 
most popular writer in the country" has written this novel of New York society, which is 
" better than even his own 'The Fighting Chance.' " Illustrated. $1.50. 

David Graham Phillips LIQHT-FINQERED GENTRY 

Everybody knows the powerful work of this author of " The Second Generation," etc. This 
novel he has made more of a love story than ever before. Senator Beveridge called Mr. 
Phillips "the master American novelist." Illustrated. $1.50. 

Lloyd Osbourne THE ADVENTURER 

In this story of a land-ship with a crew of adventurers the author has added another delightful 
volume to the literature which includes the novels on which he collaborated with Robert 
Louis Stevenson, such as " The Wrecker " and " Ebb Tide." Illustrated. $1.50. 



THREE SUPERB GIFT BOOKS 

Each profusely illustrated and illuminated in the text. Richly bound. Each, $2.50. 



LADY GERALDINE*S 
COURTSHIP 

A masterpiece of book manufac- 
ture. Mrs. Browning's famous 
love-poem has become a classic, 
and it is here given the setting 
it rightly deserves by G. C. 
Wilmshurst, a young English 
artist who has made a sensa- 
tional leap into fame through 
the charm and beauty of his 
pictures. 



DAVID 

Essentially a religious 
work, but the attempt has 
been to take only such 
parts of the Bible as shall 
give a consecutive nar- 
rative of King David's 
life. The volume is set in 
modern form, and looks 
at first sight like an ordi- 
nary biography or work of 
that type. 



THE PARABLES 

Dr. Lyman Abbott has con- 
tributed a foreword in which 
he points out the actual ap- 
plication to present-day con- 
ditions of the lessons sug- 
gested and taught by the 
Parables. The scenes illus- 
trating the Parables are laid 
in the present day in modern 
costume and have made a 
profound impression. 



"THE DIVINE SARAH'S" OWN STORY 

Sarah Bernhardt MEMORIES OF MY LIFE 

Without question the greatest actress of her generation, and perhaps the greatest actress of 
all time, Sarah Bernhardt has lived a wonderful life outside the theatre as well as within. 
She is a painter and sculptor of recognized ability ; she writes with great charm, and she has 
an inexhaustible enthusiasm for life in all its phases. The memoirs of this astounding woman 
could not but be fascinating. 8vo. Illustrated. $4.00 net (postage additional).

READY IN OCTOBER 

FIVE BEAUTIFUL BOOKS 

One of the most unique and beautiful series of illustrated books ever 
offered to American readers at the remarkably low price of $3.50 each 

Each volume superbly illustrated with quantities of full-page plates in many colors by a new and 
extremely artistic process far superior to that in ordinary use. The bindings of these volumes 
are very attractive and are in keeping with the text and illustrations. 

VENICE 

By BERYL DE SEUNCOURT and MAY STURGE-HENDERSON 

With numerous colored plates after water color drawings by REGINALD BARRATT, of the Royal Water Color Society. 

Large 8to, Net, $3.50. Edition de Luxe, Special Net, $7.50. 

WENICE is to-day, and has been for many hundreds of years, one of the most interesting cities of the world. It 

• charms the traveler from every country. Its picturesque canals and buildings, its people and its art, have 

been the wonder of the writers of several centuries. 

The present sumptuous volume seems to the publishers to be a most successful attempt to depict the subtle 
beauties of Venice. This volume, in fact, embodies certain new material never before printed. 

CAIRO, JERUSALEM, AND DAMASCUS 

Three Chief Cities of the Egyptian Sultans. 

By D. S. MARGOUOUTH, D.Litt., Laudlan Professor of Arabic in the University of Oxford. 

Fully illustrated in color after water-color originals by W. S. S. TYRWHITT. R.B.A. 

With additional plates after paintings by REGINALD BARRATT, A.R.W.S., and from native subjects. 

8vo, Cloth, Net, $3.50. Edition de Luxe, Special Net, $7.50. 

PROFESSOR MARGOLIOUTH is known as the possessor of a pen at once authoritative and attractive. His 
unrivalled knowledge of the history of the " Three Chief Cities" is matched with an equal knowledge of 
them as they appear to-day to the visitor. Mr. W. S. S. Tyrwhitt has been engaged for several years in painting 
the series of water-colors here drawn upon ; whilst Mr. Barratt's architectural water colors will be found excep- 
tionally fine. 

CATHEDRAL CITIES OF ENGLAND 

By GEORGE GILBERT With sixty full-page illustrations in color by W. W. COLLINS, R.I. 
8vo, Cloth, Net, $3.50. Edition de Luxe, Special Net, $7.50. 

IN these days of foreign travel, and especially of our study of England, we believe this volume will be of as 
^ much interest and value to Americans as to the English people. The great cathedrals of England are 
reproduced in beautiful colored plates by a process which is far superior to that ordinarily in use. Besides the 
illustrations there is full and valuable text, and we feel certain that, on the whole, the volume will be found to 
be the handsomest on the subject ever issued. 

CATHEDRAL CITIES OF FRANCE 

By HERBERT MARSHALL, R.W.S., and HESTER MARSHALL 

With sixty full-page illustrations in color. 8vo, Cloth, Net, $3.50. 

EDITION DE LUXE, bound in embossed red leather, gilt tops, illustrations mounted on French hand-made paper, 

and specially printed title-page. Special Net, $10.00. 

ANOTHER beautiful book, faithfully reproducing in color the famous Cathedral Cities of France, which have 
for centuries charmed travellers by their beauty and picturesqueness and which are being visited more 
and more each year by American travellers. The illustrations are made by the same process as those in 
CATHEDRAL CITIES OF ENGLAND, and are just as beautiful. The descriptive text is entertaining 
and complete and the binding is most attractive. 

VERSAILLES AND THE TRIANONS 

By M. NOLHAC, Ths Keeper of Versailles. 

With sixty full-page illustrations in color by REN£ BINET. Made expressly for this book. 

8vo, Cloth, Net, $3.50. Edition de Luxe, Special Net, $7.50. 

WERSAILLES fills so large a place in the traditions of the French nation and in the history of its art that it 

' behooves the foreigner to acquire an accurate idea of it. Americans can gain much knowledge of that 

fascinating place from this book — from its interesting text and beautiful colored illustrations. The color work 

in Versailles is quite equal in every respect to " Cathedral Cities of England," and the text is a sympathetic and 

interesting description of the famous historic and artistic features of the great show place of Paris. The general 

design of the book is uniform with " Cathedral Cities."

THIS MONTH'S 
MAGAZINES 



A Word to Librarians: 

Every librarian is constantly 
being asked questions like 
this about current periodicals: 
"What new magazine is that 
article about in?" 

The only index that supplies this 
kind of information is WHAT'S 
IN THE MAGAZINES. 

Your regular periodical index, un- 
equalled as it is for general refer- 
ence, is necessarily three or four 
weeks behind time. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

for October (for instance) comes 
out when the October magazines 
are being published. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

gives a classified index of the con- 
tents of one hundred leading peri- 
odicals, grouped according to sub- 
-ject and general character, and 
arranged alphabetically. 

Although complete and accurate, it 
is so simple in arrangement that 
the library patrons can use it as 
easily as the librarian. 

WHAT'S IN THE MAGAZINES 

is very inexpensive — fifty cents a 
year — and every library should be 
a subscriber. If you are the li- 
brarian of a library with many 
magazine readers, you can readily 
see what an aid it will be to you. 

We should be glad to receive 
your subscription, or to send you 
a free sample copy upon request.

TIfi: EQUIVOCATIONS OF 
PRAGMATISM. 

Technical metaphysics is not the province of 
The Dial. But a fasliion of thinking, the name 
of which " fairly spots the pages of the philo- 
i<ophical journals," and which has even Ixicome 
a theme of newspaper jest and comment, is 
perhaps not too recondite for a journal of the 



broader literary criticism to which nothing 
human is alien. The Pragmatic Sanction, if I 
may say so, of pragmatism is found in the fact 
that Professor James and Mr. Schiller (who calls 
it Humanism) have wTitten entertaining books 
about it. From the pragmatist point of view, 
this suffices. The cause or concomitant of so 
pleasing an effect must be itself commendable. 

Philosophj^, we are told, is an affair of tem- 
perament. And as we all have temperaments, 
but are not quite sure that we have philosophies, 
we are flattered. But. imfortunately, in addition 
to the genial pragmatist temperament that 
willingly accepts a " loose world,'" and could be 
content in the tub of Diogenes if open to the sun 
and air, there exists as an irreducible fact the 
thin, rigid, logical temijerament — whether to 
be classified as tough or tender I hardly know. 
And the first reaction of this temperament to a 
new all-embracing philosophy that can " satisfy 
both kinds of demand." and at the same time 
agreeably tickle our sense of subtlety and inge- 
nuity, is a lot of uncomfortable distinctions and 
reserves. All philo.sophies outside of Bedlam 
admit the appeal to experience. But a phil- 
osophy that peremptorily demands the "cash 
value " of every proposition in experiential terms 
may sometimes be in too great a hurry to " cash 
in." Some propositions, as Cicero knew, can 
be cashed only by a clever orator at the bank of 
opinion. All philosophies to-day accept in some 
sense the test by resiUts. But a philosophy that 
makes special profession of so doing runs the 
risk, despite the caveat " unless the belief 
incidentally clashes wth other ^^tal benefits," 
of contemplating only immediate, ob\'ious, emo- 
tional consequences, to the neglect of the remoter 
effects which must be tracetl by close observation 
and prolonged consecutive thought. The imme- 
diate results of pragmatism are readable lectures, 
and a pleasant stir and hum, as of " something 
doing ' in the philosophic world. But if the 
remote consequences of this contribution to the 
gayet}' of nations included a weakening of the 
sense of logical coherence and relevancy in all 
who take the game seriously, a painfid utilitarian 
calculus would be required to determine the 
inclination of the balance of profit and loss, and 
the consequent truth or falsity of the doctrine. 

The comprehensiveness claimed for the new 
philosophy seems to rest on a series of equivo- 



274 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



cations. The Platonist's, the Schoolman's, the 
Berkeleian insistence on unequivocal definition 
of all ambiguous terms is triumphantly annexed 
as a part of the pragmatic method. But in his 
own practice there is nothing of which the 
pragmatist is so shy as the explicit acknowl- 
edgment of the double meanings of his words. 
" Rationalist," for example, is habitually taken 
in the sense of a priori absolutist, though a 
recognition of the meanings given to the term 
in Lecky's, or rather in Benn's, " History of 
Rationalism " would force pragmatism to choose 
between identification with its own left wing of 
positivism and its right wing, " The Will to 
Believe." The test of theory as " working 
hypothesis " by its results in the scientific order 
of verifiable external fact is continually con- 
founded with the test by alleged or predicted 
consequences in the moral, social, and emotional 
order. True ideas are defined as those which we 
can " assimilate, corroborate, validate, verify " — 
as if the indefinite subjective terra '■ assimilate " 
were synonymous with the precise objectivity of 
" verify." 

In style as well as in logic, the pragmatist 
manifests a gi-eat-soided superiority to consist- 
ency. He protests in the name of nominalistic 
devotion to the concrete richness of particular 
fact against such innocent abstract personifica^ 
tions as ' The Law," " The Latin Langiiage," 
but habitually speaks of his own philosophy as 
"she" and dwells complacently on " her" gen- 
iality, "her" comprehensiveness, "her" demo- 
cratic mannei's. 

And it must be admitted that " she " is 
attractive. She jumbles unrelated things in so 
fascinating an Emersonian fashion that the 
toughest mind has a glimmering of their final 
reconciliation in God. She says undisputed 
things in such a lively way that one must be 
not only hard-headed but hard-hearted not to 
iiccept the disputable into the bargain. Fcmme 
est souve?it varie: She wins our assent to the 
statement that abstract propositions must be 
verified in pai-ticular experiences, and asks us to 
admit that speculative opinions are "validated" 
if they warm the cockles of our heart and help 
us to live. She is convulsed with laughter at 
the old-fashioned seventeenth-century gai*b of 
the encyclopaedic Leibnitz, but is willing to 
bury Herbert Spencer in Westminster Abbey 
because, in spite of his bad literary manners, 
his heart wa.s in the right place and he was 
fond of little — facts. She affirms that abso- 
lute truth is a chimsra, and infers not that 
probability is the guide of life and our chief 



study should be its degrees, but that one thing 
is as probable as another — and more so, if it 
is interesting or consoling. She begins with 
reason as the faculty or method by which we 
inquire what is, or must be, or probably will 
be, and ends by celebrating it as the triumph- 
ant affirmation of what we wish to be. She 
alternately takes " rational " in the sense of 
intelligible, in terms of efficient causation, and 
intelligible in terms of conformity to the heart's 
desire. She denounces metaphysics as a cobweb 
of verbal illusion spun by schoolmen, and instead 
of dropping it and devoting herself to philology, 
mathematics, or history, spins a new web of 
her own with glittering threads of metaphor and 
epigi-am. 

Such is Pragmatism in its most brilliant repre- 
sentative. Professor James. It is not a logically 
coherent doctrine or method, but the picturesque 
expression of a temperament, and of certain 
lively likes and dislikes — of the genial instmct 
for the illuminating, the vivid, the human touch 
that makes his writings such good reading, of a 
Baconian delight in the rhetorical exaltation of 
scientific method and exact verification, com- 
bined with a vivacious impatience of the thing, 
of a distaste for the tender, solemn, periodic, and 
pantheistic fluency of his friend and colleague 
Professor Royce, and a natural preference for 
his own breezy, staccato, eruptive, electrifying, 
Emersonian manner ; above all, of the wish to 
believe, or retain the right to believe, in cer- 
tain manifestations the probability of which in 
the present state of our knowledge is negligible, 
and a consequent aversion to those close esti- 
mates of the degrees of reasoned probability 
which tend to circumscribe and hamper the 
flights of popular philosophy. 

But there are other types of pragmatist and 
other methods of approach to the doctrine. 
To some, it is simply scientific positivism or 
empiricism. Philosophy and literature, which 
are hardly progressive sciences, periodically 
awaken to the perception that their formulas 
have become conventionalized and have lost 
touch with life and fact. The cry is raised, 
"Back to nature and reality." This experience 
is felt as unique by each new generation of 
reformers and innovators. And the new for- 
mida, even when no better than the old, is at 
least for a time more vividly realized. Many 
students of our own day, brought up in what 
Mill woidd undiscriminatingiy style the " Ger- 
man school " of philosophy, and supposing them- 
selves to be at the opposite pole of thought from 
Mill, have, under the steady pressure of physical

science and modem empiricism, been forced into 
substantial agreement with him. But they are 
unwilling to wear the old-fashioned Comtist or 
positi^-ist label. And they hare too long bowed 
to the idol of " Apperception " to profess them- 
selves at this late day followers of the mere 
assoeiationist Mill who had no use for the word 
in his vocabulary. Pragmatism enables them 
to express their painfully achieved empiricism 
in a language which may blend in any desired 
proportion new elements with the pious reten- 
tion of Hegelian and Kantian terminology In a 
Pickwickian sense. 

Again, there is the psychological and evolu- 
tionary" method of approach. From this point 
of \-iew, the much abused Herbert Spencer is 
the chief inspiration of the pragmatists. For 
it is from him that they learned to look upon 
mind as an instnunent gradually fashioned in 
the evolutionary process to serve the practical 
needs of the organism. — though, it is true, the 
germ of the same idea might have been found 
in a more poetic form in Schopenhauer's doc- 
trine of the subordination of the intellect to the 
will. But is not this an admission that, after 
all, pragmatism is •• true "? If the intellect is 
merely a tool, a means to an end. how can it 
isolate itself and operate disinterestedly in 
vacuo ? Well, absolutely it crannot. But we are 
not dealing with absolutes. In actual human 
experience we know that there is a vast differ- 
ence between the " dry light of the intellect " 
and the mind all of whose processes are suffused 
with emotion and which easily believes what it 
wills. We know that in nothing do men differ 
more than in the measure they possess of this 
power of clear-eyed intellectual detachment — 
which we may denominate, according to taste, 
the Schopenhauerian release of the intellect from 
the sla\"ish ser%-ice of the will, or Evolution's last 
best gift lo man. It is a verj- precious gift ; 
and if pragmatism tends to confuse and impair 
it, to encoui-age in its st«ad vague, loose, and 
emotional thinking, why. pragmatism is prag- 
matically condemned by its own consequences. 

Lastly, we may note as a third possible prag- 
matic group. — the practical men. the men who 
ask to have •' the goods delivered." who want to 
"get there." who believe that " nothing succeeds 
like success," who are '• out for the dollars " and 
the votes, who are confronted by •• a condition, 
not a theory," who know that the measure is 
sure to pass, who deplore their dexiations from 
the absolute ideal, but who " had " to have the 
money, or carry the precinct, or sell a hundred 
thousand copies. We fancy them especiallv nu- 



merous in our hustling time. But the Socrates 
of Plato's " Gorgias '' held debate with them 
long ago. and heard and said all that there is to 
be said pro and con. They are not philosophers, 
thotigh they supply matter for philosophy. And 
they are naturally attracted to a philosophy 
which not only justifies their t]k-pe. which is well. 
but may seem to •• ^•alidate " the surrival of no 
other type, which is not so well. 

But why this fierce denimciation of the harm- 
less necessary shibboleth of the most up-to-date 
philosophy? ^Tiy. because it is neither necessarj" 
nor harmless, but superfluous so far as true, 
confusing so far as equivocal, and emasculating 
so far as false. A professed pragmatist may be. 
as we have seen, a positi>'ist imwilling to wear 
his label, a half-emancipated Hegelian, a pjs- 
chologist systematically exaggerating the sub- 
ordination of the intellect to the will, a Kantian 
postulating what he cannot prove *' as if " it 
were so. a Newmanite undermining reason in the 
interests of dogma ; a wistful poet consulting the 
•' Oracle of the Gold-fishes " : a Napoleonic seomer 
of •• ideologists ": an adept in psychical research 
asking us to accept the indefinitely improbable 
because in the infinity of our ignorance we can- 
not prove it a priori impossible ; a writer of 
genius confounding and exploiting all these 
tendencies in an entertaining book. Such a 
word can only confuse the public, as it has con- 
fused the publishers of Professor Santayana, who 
gravely advertise that poetic but fundamentally 
hard-headed rationalist as a pragmatist. Of all 
the possible meanings of the term, there remain 
but one or two not already better expressed. It 
might be used to name the in terrorem argument 
popular with a certain school of Apologetics, 
which challenges us to accept its d(^^mas on 
penalty of dire consequences to the soul's welfare 
or the social order if we do not. But the prag- 
matists themselves woidd lie the first to protest 
against this limitation of the term, and Mr. Alfred 
Benn has coined a better name, or at least a less 
ambiguous one. for the idea in his •• Ophelism. " 

There remains the supposition that Pragma- 
tism is merely the will or the right to believe, 
masquerading in the garb of scientific positivism 
and unmetaphysical common-sense. This the 
pragmatist pronounces •• an impudent slander." 
But a door must lie either open or shut: and 
if Pragmatism is not essentially the will to 
believe, the emlvirrassing question which its 
ingenious expositor received one morning on a 
postcard recurs : " Is a pragmatist necessarily a 
complete materialist and agnostic ? '

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The November issue of "The Atlantic 
Monthly " is probably the most interesting num- 
ber ever published of any American magazine. It 
marks the completion of the first half-century of a 
periodical whose distinction may fairly be called 
unique — a periodical more intimately associated 
than any other with the best traditions of our liter- 
ature, and intrenched as no other has ever been in 
the affections of our more serious public. No other 
magazine is a national institution in the sense of the 
'' Atlantic," and no other can boast a career of such 
high and uniform . achievement. Adapting itself 
freely to the changing needs of the successive years, 
it has always stood for sobriety and sanity as well 
as for literary excellence, and has always upheld 
the finer ideals of thought and conduct. For this 
steadfastness in the faith as delivered to the fathers 
of the republic it deserves well of their descendants, 
and the ripe age to which it has now attained 
should prove the occasion of many a warm tribute 
to its virtues. As the covers of the magazine have 
informed us for many years, it has been devoted to 
literature, science, art, and politics, and it is thus 
appropriate that each of these great interests, as 
related to American life, should be made the sub- 
ject of a fifty years' review in this jubilee number. 
Colonel Higginson, President Pritchett, Dr. Mabie, 
and President Wilson, are the respective authors of 
these four retrospective surveys. But even more 
interesting is Professor Norton's account of " The 
Launching of the Magazine," Mr. J. T. Trowbridge's 
'' An Early Contributor's Recollections," Mr. W. D. 
Howells's "Recollections of an Atlantic Editorship," 
to say nothing of the hitherto unpublished poem by 
Lowell, — all of which f eatm'es precede the fom- 
special summaries. Nor is the feast yet ended, for 
President Wilson has no sooner ended his plea for 
the individualism that is essentially American, than 
Mr. Arthur Oilman entertains us with an account of 
" Atlantic Dinners and Diners." He is followed by 
the present editor, who has unearthed the old cor- 
respondence-book of F. H. Underwood, and, under 
the caption " The Editor Who Was Never the 
Editor," has printed a great niunber of interesting 
letters. Finally, we have a chatty contribution on 
" Unbound Old Atlantics " by Miss Lida F. Baldwin. 
We say finally, and yet besides all these treasures 
of reminiscence, the anniversary number contains 
much matter of the usual sort. But that is another 
story. ... 

The cheekful improvidence of genius has 
something winsome in it, even to those who have 
to foot the bills of these care-free children of 
the muses. Burns, De Quincey, Landor, William 
Oodwin, Bronson Alcott, Leigh Hunt, and all the 
other Harold Skimpoles, whether of fact or of fiction, 
are interesting and attractive largely because of 
their sharing with the lilies of the field a constitu- 
tional inability to toil and spin. That very lack of 



practical foresight that irritates us, and that would 
bring speedy ruin and disgrace upon oui' own heads, 
somehow allures and fascinates the uncalculating 
part of our nature, which, after all, so largely 
governs our conduct and so almost exclusively deter- 
mines our affections. No worldly-unwise absurdity 
or unpredictable eccentricity on the part of the late 
artist Whistler, for instance, could make him other 
than a most entertaining and, on the whole, ingra- 
tiating personality. There has lately come to light 
an incident that illustrates, though not in just the 
way one might have expected, his extraordinary 
forgetfulness in practical matters and his utter lack 
of business instinct. Being dunned by a creditor 
whose patience had become exhausted, and receiving 
formal notice that legal measures would be resorted 
to unless remittance of the amount due was made by 
return of post, the artist sought the aid and advice 
of a friend living in the neighborhood. Explaining 
that he had a small balance at his banker's, the 
amount of which he could not tell, he asked his 
friend to stop at the bank on his way to business 
and ascertain how much the deposit lacked of 
eighteen pounds, the amount of the debt; and this 
deficiency the friend was requested to make good, 
as a temporary loan, so that Whistler might imme- 
diately mail a check to his creditor. The desired 
assistance was promised, and soon the state of the 
artist's account was being looked into by the bank 
cashier, who after a few minutes' search among the 
ledgers submitted to the astonished friend a memo- 
randum indicating that James A. McNeill Whistler 
had to his credit a balance of something over six 
thousands pounds — a pleasant revelation to the 
absent-minded depositor, though he was sorely puz- 
zled to account for the whence and the wherefore 
of that astonishing balance. 

The late dean of British men of letters, 
David Masson, so long survived the appearance of 
his more important literary works that probably 
more than one admirer of his monumental " Life of 
Milton " only became aware that its author was still 
alive from reading the notice of his death — if the 
bull is permissible. Sixty-three years ago Carlyle 
hailed the young author of "The Three Devils: 
Luther's, Milton's, and Ooethe's " as the honestest 
of literary craftsmen and a friend that was simple, 
sincere, open-minded, and helpful. Long after that, 
it is interesting to recall, this honest literary crafts- 
man was proposed to Carlyle, or by him, as perhaps 
the suitable person to undertake the difficult and 
delicate task that finally, as all the world knows, 
fell to Froude. In a review of Lord Cockburn's 
" Life of Lord Jeffrey," contributed to " The North 
British Review" fifty-five years ago, Professor 
Masson, discussing Scottish influence on British 
literature, inclines to the opinion that the peculiar 
characteristic of the Scotch intellect, the funda- 
mental quality of the perfervidum incjenium Scot- 
orum, is emphasis. " All Scotchmen are emphatic" 



1907.]

he declares. ^ If a Seotefaman is a fooL he gives 
such emphasis to the nongetwe he ntters as to be 
considerably more insufferable than a fool of any 
other coontry : if a Scotchman is a man of genins. 
he gives such emphasis to the good things he has to 
eommunicate that they have a supronely good ehanee 
of being at once or very »oon attended to." In 
Ifasson's vigor and effectiveness there is sorely no 
ladt of emphasis. Whatever he had to conimnnicate 
had a ver}* good chance of being attended to with- 
out much delay. Bom in Aberdeenshire and hold- 
ing for almost half his long life a professorship in 
Edinburgh University, he was through and through 
a Scotchman, and was also the teacher of eminent 
Scotchmen, from Ian Maclaren and Henrj- Drum- 
mond in the late siarties, to Barrie and Crockett in the 
early eighties — and who knows how many others, 
of a later decade, that are still to make themselves 
famous !' As first editor of " Macmillan's Magazine," 
young Masson rallied about him as contributors 
many of the foremost writers of the time, with 
Carlyle, Tennyson, and Thackeray among them. As 
a force stimulating to good literary work by both 
example and precept, he made himself felt in London 
as afterward in Edinburgh. Filling for many years 
a chair of English literature and rhetoric, he gained 
the love as well as the respect of his pupils. "His 
work in the class," sapi one who knows. •• was 
always alive with enthusiasm, the enthusiasm bom 
of broad scholarship and resolute conviction that he 
had a great message to deliver. The text of the 
lectures was not the main thing: it was the man. 
Belief, not novelty, is the basis of all originality. 
Masson did not seek to train special researchers 
along Ph.D. lines of barren activity : his aim was 
ever to develop that latent power of vision which is 
the source of all great literary ejcpression."

The Rhodes scholabs fbom this oocxtky, of 
which the first have now been graduated, promise 
to reflect no discredit on the land of their birth. It 
is just three years ago that fortv--three students from 
all parts of the United States, from urban universities 
and from fresh-water colleges, matriculated at Oxford 
and selected their various courses of stndy. Of this 
number two died and one resigned his scholarship 
before completing the course, while the remaining 
fortv- are accounted for as follows : Twenty-four 
entered regular courses leading to the degree of 
A.B.. three choosing claasies. seven history, six law, 
four English literature, two theology, one German, 
and one geology. In the published dass lists at the 
end of the course, six were placed in the first class, 
eight in the second, seven in the third, and three in 
the fourth. As it is a distinction to win even a 
second class, and no dishonor to be enrolled in the 
third, it will be seen that our twentj--fonr made a very 
creditable showing. Of th^ sixteen students study- 
ing for degrees other than A.B.. five chose the course 
leading to the deg^ree of Bachelor of Civil Law, the 
hardest coarse at Oxford, and usually entered upon 



by Englishmen only after an ordinary law coarse 
and several years' practice at the bar. One of the 
five Americans took a first daas an examination at 
the end, one a second, and the othos thirds. £ag^ 
American students followed special or research 
coorses analogous to those required for the ^i.D. 
\ degree in our universities : but three were forced to 
abandon their projects for lack of adequate instruc- 
tion or direction, two failed to pass their examinadons, 
and three secured degrees. Of the three remaining 
I out of the whole namber, one chose not to ~ read " 
I for any d^ree, while the other two selected courses 
impossible to finish in three years ; and one of these 
two remains longer, at his own expense, the other 
l>eing permitted to carry on his studies tn aiagHtia. 
This is a very good showing, on the vhole, f<v 
pioneers, and encourages hope for better things still 
to come. If none of our men has yet proved him- 
self a prodigy of scholarship, a Rhodes Colossus, so 
I to speak, it must be remembered what disadvantages 
I of various kinds this initial lot of Americans had to 
contend against in meeting the Oxford students on 
their native heath. But whatever they may have 
failed to acquire of book-learning, they have enjoyed 
advantages of foreign traveL have seen a bit of the

The kbscue of the Haxvaki> Hottse at 

Stratford is to be credited to two widely separated 

: and widely different persons — Miss Marie Corelli 

i of Stratford-on-Avon. and Mr. Edward Morris of 

' Chicago. The current number of "The Harvard 

< Graduates' Magazine " gives an interesting aoeount, 

from Miss Corelli's pen. of her disinterested and 

(by ilr. Morris's generous aid ) successful endeavors 

to preserve for all time (humanly speaking) the 

: historic house on High Street, Stratford, where in 

I the year 1605 Katharine R<^r8 married Robert 

! Harvard, and where, as a boy of seven or eight, 

their son John, visiting his grandparents, must more 

than once have seen William Shakespeare pass along 

the street to or from the bouse that he had recently 

built for himself, and that was long a^ suffered to 

yield to the ravages of time, or iconoclasm. This 

Rogers-Harvard house was bailt in 1596, when 

Katharine was twelve years old. by her father 

Thomas Rogers : and before Miss Corelli and Mr. 

Morris took in hand its purchase and restoration it 

had become all but a hopeless wreck. Thirteen 

; hundred pounds and more from the publie-spirited 

Chicago man's pocket, and intelligent supervision on 

the part of the no less public-spirited authoress, 

secured the honse and put it practically into the same 

condition as when little John Harvard whipped his 

top (if boys whipped tops in those days) before its 

' door. To Harvard Universitj-, as was right and fit-

ninety years. . . . 

The author of forty novels, Mrs. Mary Jane 
Holmes, leaves a multitude of readers to mourn her 
loss. The estimated sale of her mildly sensational 
love stories — beginning with '• Tempest and Sun- 
shine," published in 1854 when Mary Jane Hawes 
was still in her 'teens — is something over two mil- 
lions of copies. She continued to write nearly to the 
last, and her books, which number nearly forty, com- 
peted successfully with the more loudly heralded 
productions of the younger school of writers. Though 
leading a happy domestic life with her husband, 
Daniel Holmes, a lawyer, she had no children except 
the offspring of her fertile brain ; and that had been 
productive ever since she was fifteen years old, when 
she entered the literary field through the modest 
gate of the country newspaper. Her later contribu- 
tions to periodicals, in tlie shape of essays and criti- 
cisms and good counsels, were numerous. Interesting 
to the student of heredity is her relationship to the 
once noted Congi'egational preacher and writer of 
Hartford, Rev. Dr. Joel Hawes, her uncle, who with 
her parents. New England farming folk of literary 
and artistic tastes, exerted considerable influence on 
her thoughts and studies. That hers was a pre- 
cocious intellect is shown by the fact that at thirteen 
she was teaching school, and at fifteen, as above 
noted, writing for publication. The intellectual life, 
however, is on the wliole the life of health and endur- 
ance, and she nearly attained the scripturally allotted 
length of days. Her stories had a pleasantly 
domestic atmosphere, and she was, as fiction-writers 
go, a safe entertainer to her large class of readers, 

the majority of whom were women and girls.

Mrs. Wister's translations from the German 
have long been recognized as contributions to 
English literature. Librarians and booksellers find 
that these romances are almost invariably called 
for as Mrs. Wister's books, not as E. Marlitt's, or 
Werner's, or Prau von HilJern's. This involuntary 
and inevitable ascription of authorship to the trans- 
lator is without a parallel. No one ever thinks of 
crediting Jeremiah Curtin with Sienkiewicz's works, 
or Miss Hapgood or Mr. Dole with Tolstoy's. In 
the A. L. A. " Catalog of 5000 Volumes for a Popu- 
lar Library " Mrs. Wister's name appears, in its 
proper alphabetical place, at the head of her trans- 
lations — or such of them as are included in the 
selected library ; but no other translator is similarly 
honored. About fifteen years ago, when what was 
expected to be the last of her books made its appear- 
ance, she excused herself from further labors of the 
sort on the plea that the daughter of her father (the 
late William H. Furness, D.D. ) and the sister of 
her brother (Dr. Horace Howard Furness) ought 
to be engaged in worthier work than translating 
German love stories for American girls to read. 
But she has at last broken her vow — if this perhaps 



playful utterance of the writer can be called a vow — 
and her publishers are about to issue still another 
translation of hers, from the German of Adolpli 
Streckfuss, entitled "The Lonely House." the pre- 
paration of wliich has probably been to Mrs. Wister 
a pleasant change from the Shakespearian researches 
in which she has of late years been aiding her 
brother. ... 

Muscular librarianship, like muscular Chris- 
tianity, ought to be the kind peculiarly suited to this 
strenuous era. " No mollycoddles need apply " 
might appropriately be appended to an advertisement 
for a public librarian. It may be with a view to 
some such future physical requirements as are here 
hinted at that the library workers of England are 
now developing their brachial and crural muscles at 
cricket. An English periodical, unassuming in size 
and in title (it calls itself " The Library Assistant ") 
reports that " the return match between library 
assistants north of the Thames and assistants south 
of the Thames was played at Regent's Park on 
Aug. 28. The South Side was again successful, 
obtaining 64 runs as against 39 scored by the North. 
A full report of the game will appear next month." 
The time may come — though we confess we are 
not eagerly awaiting its advent — when " The 
Library Journal " or " Public Libraries " will give 
detailed reports of close and exciting ten-innings 
games between the Cleveland Public Library nine 
and the Detroit Public Library nine, or of fierce 
struggles on tlie gridiron between the Carnegies of 
Pittsburg and the John Crerars of Chicago. The 
curious part of all this is that America has allowed 
herself to be anticipated in this new movement, 
whereas hitherto she has taken the lead in all 
branches of library science. 

... 

The rehabilitation of French literature 
in the eyes of the American reading public is urged 
by M. Hugues Le Roux. He suggests the establish- 
ment in New York of a large depot for the sale of the 
best, and only the best. French books, all objec- 
tionable yellow-backs to be barred out. M. Marcel 
Provost would have a similar warehouse opened in 
London. Still another French litterateur, M. Jules 
Claretie, is quoted as deploring that Americans form 
their notions of modern French literature from 
pornographic rubbish. Reference has already been 
made to the step lately taken by a prominent English 
publishing house in issuing novels from across the 
Channel in sober and respectable cloth binding. 
With all these well-meant endeavors Gallic literature 
ought to be able to hold up its head in foreign lands.

The QrEEX of thk Fbexch Stage.* 

In the •' personal, professional, and social recol- 
lections as woman an.l artist " of the greatest 
living French actress, one is not surprised to 
find the domesric reoollefctions as wife and 
mother placing no part whatever. So identi- 
fied Is ^Ime. Sarah Bernhardt with her art and 
her ambitions that no one ever thinks of her as 
the widow Damala, and few remember that she 
has enjoyed the pleasures — if they were pleas- 
ures to her — of maternity. Hence it is that 
in her very characteristic and brightly enter- 
taining memoirs we have on every page the 
Sarah Bernhardt of the stage, the eccentric and 
versatile woman of genius, very much as she is 
already known to the world. 

With a reticenc-e not unusual in autobiog- 
raphies of women Mme. Bernhardt omits to 
mention the date of her birth ; but as she after- 
ward speaks of herself as a young woman of 
twenty-four at the time of the siege of Paris, 
one can make a shrewd guess at the year when 
she was bom. It is worth notins that her 
mother was but sixteen jears old when she gave 
birth to this child of genius — worth noting 
becatise it has been lately ascertained that men 
and women of genius are as a rule the late-bom 
children of their parents. From infancy the 
little Sarah, by her own showing, had all the 
qualities of wilfulness, impulsiveness, nervous- 
ness, and uncontrollabilitj-. that have marked 
her maturely developed character. Let us 
quote one characteristic incident of childhood, 
which is related in the course of a description 
of her theatrical debut at the Comedie Fran- 
caise, when two veterans of the stage showed 
her especial kindness. 

" Both men had been moved by the same sentiiiient 
of protection for the poor, fragile, nervous girl, who 
was, nevertheless, so full of hope. Both of them knew 
my leal for work, my obstinate will, which was always 
struggling for victtny over my physical weakness. They 
knew that my device' Quan d m ime' had not been adopted 
by me merely by chance, but that it was the outcome of a 
drfiberate exercise of will power on my part. My mother 
had told me how I had chosen this device at the age of 
nine, after a formidable jump over a dit^h which no 
one could jump, and whii-b my young cousin had dared 
me to attempt. I had hurt my face, broken my wrist, 
and was in pain all over. While I was being carried 
home I exclaimed furiously: ' Yes, I would do it again, 
gtUBid-mane, if any one dared me again. And 1 will 
always do what I want to do all my life.' In the

evening of that day. my aunt, who was grieved to see 
me in such pain, asked me what would give me ainr 
pleasure. My poor little body was all bandaged, hot I 
jumped with joy at this, and quite eonsoled I wfai^>eied 
m a coaxing way : ' I should like to have some writing 
paper with a motto of my own.* My mother asked 
me rather slyly what my motto was. I did not answer 
for a minute, and then, as they were all waiting quietly, 
I uttered such a furious ' Quand-mieme ' that my Aunt 
Faure started back muttering, ' What a terriUe child ! ' '* 

In a rapid, lively style the writer narrates her 
childish joys and woes, ^^ctories and defeats, at 
boarding-school and convent, where her rather 
scanty education (imder pedagogic supervision) 
was obtained, and where she seems to have lived 
up to her reputation of ''a terrible child.'" And 
yet she must even then have been attractive and 
interesting, for she was hardly more than a 
child when she received an offer of marriage 
from a rich tanner who enjoyed an income of 
sixty thousand francs and offered to settle a 
fortune of a half million on his young bride. 
This half million, or any part of it. she was to 
be at liberty to make over to her mother, then 
a widow, if she chose ; and if she refused him 
the tanner assured her that he should die of 
despair. Yet she did refuse him, choosing art 
for her brid^room instead, and he found conso- 
laticm elsewhere. 

After a course of study at the Conser\-atoire 
Nationale de Musique et de Declamation, the 
gifted young woman — for her histrionic talent 
was speedly recognized — received an invitation 
to join the Comedie Francaise : and here she 
made her first public appearance as actress. 
Some of the press comments on those early 
performances of hers are interesting to read now 
after the lapse of almost half a century. Here 
are a few chosen at random, and as quoted in 
the book. 

" Mile. Bernhardt, who made her d^bat yesterday in 
the role of Ipkigenie, is a tall, {H^tty girl with a slender 
figure and a very pleasing expression, the upper part 
of her face is remarkably beautifuL She holds hersdf 
well, and her enunciation is perfectly clear. This is all 
that can be said for her at present." 

" The same evening ' Les Fenunes Stivantes ' was 
given. This was Mile. Bemhaidt's third appea r ance, 
and she took the role of HenrieUe. She was just as 
pretty and insignificant in this as in that of Junie (he 
had made a mistake, as it was IpUgenie I had played) 
and of Valerie, both of which loloi had been entrusted to 
her previously. This performance was a Tery poor affair, 
and gives rise to reflections by no means gay. . . . The 
pitiful part is, though, that the comedians playing with 
her were not much better than she was, and they are 
Socielaireg of the Th^tre Fran^ais. All that they had 
more than their young comrade was a greater familiarity 
with the boards. They are just as Mile. Bernhardt may 
be in twenty years' time, if she stays at the Comedie 
Francaise."

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



" Mile. Sarah Beniliardt appeared wearing an eccen- 
tric costume, which increased the tumult, but her rich 
voice — that astonishing voice of hers — appealed to 
the public, and she charmed them like a little Orpheus." 

As the wi'iter confesses in a later chapter, 
she " had a continual thirst for what was 
new"; and therefore her sudden changes from 
one theatre to another, or from the stage to 
private life, and back again, need not surprise 
us. Her " matl prank " of a seemingly motiveless 
trip to Spain, without telling her mother and 
sisters of her project, was only one of many 
impulsive acts of her young womanhood. Her 
intense interest in the fortunes of the French 
armies in the war with Prussia, and her anguish 
over their defeat, reduced her to a condition in 
which for three days she was " between life and 
death." On hearing of the enemy's triumph at 
Sedan, she was utterly prostrated. " The blood 
rushed to my head," she says, in language that 
might perhaps astonish a physician, " and my 
lungs were too weak to control it. I lay back 
on my piUow, and the blood escaped through 
my lips with the groans of my whole being." 
She turned the Odeon, where she hatl been 
playing, into a military hospital, and seems to 
have acted very energetically the part of chief 
nurse. With equal vehemence, a few years 
later, she threw herself into the perilous amuse- 
ment of ballooning. " I adored and I still 
adore balloons," she gushmgly declares, and then 
enlivens her narrative with a graphic account 
of a balloon ascension in which she reached a 
height that made breathing difficult and caused 
other bodily discomfort. But queerest of all 
queer things was her practice of studying her 
parts and of sleeping in her coffin. 

" My bedroom was very tiny. The big bamboo bed 
took up all the room. In front of the window was my 
coffin, where I frequently installed myself to learn my 
parts. Therefore when I took my sister to my home I 
found it quite natural to sleep every night in this little 
bed of white satm which was to be my last couch, and 
to put my sister in the big bamboo bed under the lace 
hangings. . . . Three days after this new arrangement 
my manicure came into the room to do my hands and 
my sister asked her to enter quietly because I was 
still asleep. The woman turned her head, believing 
that I was asleep in the armchair, but seeing me in my 
coffin she rushed away, shrieking wildly. From that ■ 
moment all Paris knew that I slept in my coffin, and 
gossip with its thistle-down wings took flight in all 
directions." 

A picture — and a very pretty one it is, too — 
is given of the fair sleeper in her satin-lined 
coffin, her hands crossed on her bos()m, and her 
white robe sprinkled with flowers. 

In opening the chapter on her London debut, 
the writer says, " I had never been on the sea 



when it was decided that the artistes of the 
Comedie Francjaise should go to London." But 
she forgets that matl scamper into Spain, when 
she journeyed by coasting vessel from Marseilles 
to Alicante, " six days of rough sea. ' Consid- 
erable space is given to the American tour of 
1880, with which the book ends. As a final 
quotation a few passages descriptive of Chicago, 
as the visiting French actress saw it, may be of 
interest. 

" I went to the Palmer House, one of the most mag- 
nificent hotels of that day, whose proprietor, Mr. Palmer, 
was a perfect gentleman, coiu'teous, kind, and generous, 
for he filled the immense apartment I occupied with the 
rarest flowers, and taxed his ingenuity in order to have 
me served in the French style, a rare thing at that 
time. 

" We were to remain a fortnight in Chicago. Our 
success exceeded all expectations. This fortnight at 
Chicago seemed to me the most agreeable days I had 
had since my arrival in America. First of all there 
was the vitality of the city iu which men pass each other 
without ever stopping, with knitted brows, with one 
thought in mind, ' the end to attain.' They move on 
and on, never turning for a cry or prudent warning. 
What takes place behind them matters little. They 
do not wish to know why a cry was raised ; and they 
have no time to be prudent, ' the end to attain ' awaits 
them. . . . 

" On the day of my last performance, a magnificent 
collar of camellias in diamonds was handed me on behalf 
of the ladies of Chicago. I left that city fond of every- . 
thing in it — its people, its lake as big as a small inland 
sea, its audiences who were so enthusiastic, everything, 
everything, but its stockyards. 

" I did not even bear any ill-will toward the bishop 
who also, as had happened in other cities, had denounced 
my art and French literature. By the violence of his 
sermons he had as a matter of fact advertised us so 
well that Mr. Abbey, the manager, wrote the following- 
letter to him: 

" ' His Grace : Whenever I visit your city I am 
accustomed to spend 55400 in advertising. But as you 
have done the advertising for me, I send you $200 for 
your poor. Henky Abbey.' " 

A few more pages, and the volume ends with a 
characteristic note of defiant exultation. " Mj^ 
life," concludes the writer, " which I thought 
at first was to be so short, seemed now likely 
to be very, very long, and that gave me a great 
mischievous delight whenever I thought of the 
infernal displeasure of my enemies. I resolved 
to live. I resolved to be the great artiste that 
I longed to be. And from the time of this 
return [from America] I gave myself entirely 
up to my life." To what else she had hitherto 
given herself up does not appear in her pages : 
a person more determined to live her own life 
from start to finish surely never lived. But 
the last quarter-century of her life has undoubt- 
edly had a depth and an intensity lacking to

readers. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The South Sixck the Wak.* 

The history of the South since the war is 
summed up in the two volumes of the Lee-Thorpe 
series, by Messrs. Hamilton and Bruce. Both ; 
authors, writing with ease of stjle and breadth 
of view, have produced readable books. In the 
work of Mr. Hamilton there is a commendable 
absence of pettj- detail. In Mr. Bruce's volume 
at times the statistical matter becomes monoto- 
nous ; however, it is possible for the reader to 
omit much of this and confine his attention to 
the valuable comments and interpretation of the 
author. There is probably no greater contrast 
in historj' than that shown by the accounts given 
by these two ^vriters respectively of the most ! 
impleasant period in our national life and of the 
succeeding most LnspLring one. The Reconstruc- 
tion period has few hopeful signs ; the succeeding ; 
period has few that are not ho]>efid. 

Mr. Hamilton's volume treats mainly of 
Reconstruction in the South, only one chapter 
being devoted to affairs at the North. Other 
chapters deal with the usual topics — the South 
after the war. Lincoln's and Johnson's plans 
and acts, the Freedmen, ^lilitai'V Government, 
Impeachment of the President, Congressional 
Reconstruction, Carpet-bag Government, Ku 
Klux Klan, and the end of Reconstruction . One 
distinctively original chapter is devoted to a 
study of the race tendencies of the negroes and 
whites. Throughout the work, emphasis is laid 
upon the importance of the negro factor in the 
Reconstruction conti-oversies, and an effort is 
made to give an intelligible account of just what 
the race question meant. Mr. Hamilton says but 
little of economic conditions, and not much of the 
social disorder that existed during this period ; 
these matters are briefly disposed of in Mr. 
Bruce's succeeding volume. The omission leaves 
the Reconstruction account largely a political one, 
though there is a chapter on Religious Conditions, 
with some caref id summaries of the Fetlei-al labor 
regidations for the negroes. An intelligent and 
philosophical account is given of the white and

black secret political societies — Ku Klux Klan 
and Union League. 

There is one general criticism that may be 
made of Mr. Hamilton's volume: on some 
matters he writes his history too much from 
laws and official regulations. Now, Recon- 
struction laws, especially carpet-bag laws and 
Freedmen's Bureau regulations, cannot always 
be taken at their face value. Much interpreta- 
tion and explanation is necessary. The author 
following the letter is led to ascribe much 
importance to the Reconstruction laws as a 
nationalizing force. This is a purely legal 
^^ew, and is superficial. People are not made 
into a nation by law; certainly the Southern 
people were provincial much longer because of 
those laws. This legal habit of mind also leads 
the author, in writing of the Civil War, to 
adopt the use of such terms as rebel, rebellion, 
treason, etc., a use no longer considered histori- 
cal. One or two other points may be criticised : 
it is not likely that the Noi-th Carolina Union- 
ists cared much for the negroes (p. 141),— 
such was not the custom of Southern unionists : 
it is hardly worth while to say that the native 
whites might have controlled the blacks in 
Reconstruction, for the Reconstruction plans 
themselves practically prevented that, and the 
Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League did 
the re.st; also, in neglecting to some extent 
social matters the author does not offer adequate 
explanation for the irritation of the whites imder 
the Reconstruction government. 

Mr. Bruce's book has but one chapter about 
political matters. More than half the space is 
given to a statistical accoimt of the constantly 
increased output from Southern farm, forest, 
sea, mine, and factory. One chapter discusses 
the growth of cities suice the war, and another 
the increase of imports and exports. That Mr. 
Bruce is a master of an enormous fund of 
economic information is pi*oved by his two chap- 
ters on Southern financial matters and trans- 
portation facilities. These chapters, and those 
on etlucation and literature, population, and 
social and political tendencies, make up the 
most original part of the work, the first half 
being mainly a summary from the census and 
other official publications. 

The story of progress in the South as told 
b}- Mr. Bruce is mainly the story of the advance 
of the white districts — those r^ons kept back 
before the Civil War by the institution of 
slavery. Most of this progress had been made 
since 1880, the transition period from 1865 to 
1880 being one of doubt as to whether the

white districts or the black would dominate 
industrially. The failure of free negro labor 
in the fertile Black Belt has finally given to 
the poorer whites their opportunity, and good 
use they are making of it. The leading whites 
have since the war gone from the Black Belt 
plantations to run the railroads, banks, mines, 
and factories of the white districts. Mr. Bruce 
asserts that the i)lantations of the Black Belt are 
breaking up into small farms, — a statement true 
for most of the Upper South, but not for the heart 
of the old slave districts in the Lower South. 
There immense plantations have been and are 
being formed. A hundred small truck farms 
near Mobile do not offset the forty square mUe 
plantation recently formed in the Alabama 
Black Belt. 

In his treatment of social matters, it is seen 
that the author holds to the caste theory of ante- 
bellum society, a theory that will not do for the 
newer states of the South. This tradition of a 
class system is fast becoming a fetich, espe- 
cially among the " professional Southerners " 
who live upon a past that never existed. 

Of educational conditions since 1865, Mr. 
Bruce gives a good account. Here, however, 
he falls into the same error that Mr. Hamilton 
makes in attaching too much importance to 
laws. The carpet-bag educational system for 
Louisiana did no more to found the school- 
system in Louisiana than John Locke's Funda- 
mental Constitutions did to establish a titled 
nobility in North Carolina. As the author 
himself shows very clearly, school systems in 
the South were developed only as popidation 
became dense enough to support schools. In 
many places in the South it will be long years 
before schools can be maintained with any degree 
of success. It is the reviewer's opinion that 
Mr. Bruce's explanation of the South's lack of 
a literature is inadequate. He says it was 
because there was no "literary centre." But 
the causes of this lack lie deeper. Why was 
there no literary centre ? The answer is obvious 
to those who study the nature of ante-bellum 
intellectual activity. 

Both Mr. Bruce and Mr. Hamilton seem to 
think that certain work in the South can be 
done safely only by negroes, — the old ante- 
bellum notion. But the industrial progress of 
the Southern whites since the war has proved 
that there is but one place where whites cannot 
work (the coast of South Carolina), and no work 
that whites cannot do and do better than blacks. 
Some Black Belt planters, however, will still 
assert that only a negro can make a cotton crop ; 



and yet within ten miles of them will be whites 
producing more cotton per capita than is made 
on the best Black Belt plantation. The old 
beliefs about the influence of climate upon 
whites have lasted a long time, in spite of hard 
knocks. 

In summing up, Mr. Bruce says that there 
are certain influences more powerful than all 
others in advancing the prosperity of the 
Southern States. "These influences spring 
from the subdivision of lands : the diversifica- 
tion of agi-iculture ; the growth of manufac- 
tures ; the extension and control of railroads ; 
the spread of education : the more rapid expan- 
sion of the white than of the black popidation ; 
and finally the restriction of suffrage. In these 
seven facts of supreme importance is to be found 
the very kernel of all that the Southern people 
have accomplished since the abolition of slavery ; 
they are the foundation stones on which the 
superstructure of Southern material greatness 
is fast rising." Walter L. Fleming. 



Beginxistgs of the Moderk Drama.* 

" Plays of our Forefathers " is the not alto- 
gether fortunate title of a volume by Professor 
Charles Mills Gayley of the University of 
California. Yet it is due rather to our language 
than to any fault of the author that the title 
does not give a clearer hint of the content of 
the book. Had we the German word fJrahuen 
it woidd fit the case exactly ; for Professor 
Gayley deals with the beginnings of the modern 
drama. 

Like the classic tragedy of antiquity, the 
modern drama has its roots in things religious. 
Aspiration, mystery, and love, the spiritual 
conflicts of mankind that developed in Greece 
into the masterpieces of a Sophocles, find their 
first expression among the untutored barbarian 
invaders of Europe in the rich ritual of the 
Christian church. The decadent superstitions 
of their own past did not greatly stir their 
dramatic instinct, but the tragedy of a human 
SaA^or took hold upon their hearts. The story 
of the outgi'owth of the liturgical plays from 
the Easter trope, and their gradual development 
through the Christmas and the Advent tropes, not 
only into a world cyclus but back to the fall of 
Lucifer and forward to the last Judgment, is not, 
to be sure, new ; it has, however, never been

presented with more compelling interest. With 
admirable clearness the author also ti-aces the 
development of the hmnorous from the appear- 
ance of Balaam and his ass in the procession of 
the prophets. Whatever of pagan survival may 
linger in the festival of the ass, his appeai-ance 
within the church doors turned each event with 
which he could Ije connected into burlesque. 
The festival of fools also grew out of the liturgy, 
though doubtless it owes elements to the Roman 
festival of the New Year ; but the humorous 
element once introduced, it was bound to pre- 
vail, and ended by banishing itself, as well as 
the serious liturgical drama, from the church. 
The author sketches the transition from church 
to guild, and devotes the longer and more 
important part of his volume to a study of the 
English cycles of miracle plays and moralities. 
Their collective story, the manner of their pre- 
sentation, the historical order of the various 
cycles, their dramatic development, and the 
introduction of romance and aUegorj'. are some 
of the subjects taken up and accorded scholarly 
treatment. The volume is admirably Ulusti-atetl 
with well chosen reproductions from numerous 
sources, old cuts, manuscripts, and monuments 
each furnishing something. 

In his preface. Professor Grayley says ; " I 
have hoped that the reatling public might be 
interested in the mediaeval drama, not only as 
an instance in the development of literaiy art, 
but as a chronicle of the ideals and traditions, 
the religious consciousness, the romance and 
humour of times that seem to be remote, but 
after all are modern in a myriad surprising 
ways, and human to the core. To laugh and 
weep, to worship and to revel for a season, in 
the manner and spirit of our ancestors, were 
infinitely more pleasing than the pride of con- 
troversy or the pursuit of scientific ends." Thus 
his own is perliaps the best characterization of 
his work. He has a rare power of imparting 
life and human interest to matter that in hands 
less skilful either overwhelms or wearies the 
reader. He makes us feel that the men who 
foimd edification and amusement in these plays 
were, after all, much like ourselves. He brings 
home his facts occasionally by a reference that 
is startlingly modern : for example, in describ- 
ing a miracle of Saint Nicholas, who restored 
to life three murdered boys whose bodies had 
l>een cut into pieces and salted as pork, he 
remarks : " This was before the days of tinned 
meats ; but the methods of the packing-houses 
were, even then, not above suspicion." Pos- 
sibly it is imfair to the author to cite this 



! passage ; it might convey the idea of a prevail- 
I ing tone of burlesc^ue, and nothing is further 
from the truth. The fact is simply that Pro- 
fessor Gayley cannot deal with any subject 
without imparting to it something of the viva- 
' city and wit that are a part of his nature, 
lending to even the didlest detail the feeling 
that, though now possessing only antiquarian 
I or historical interest, it belonged in its time to 
i the vital issues of the day. To the customs 
and forms of our period he often gives a new 
interest by showing that they can really claim 
a stately ancestry ; thus, the modem vaudeville 
" stunt " claims as its remote and forgotten 
progenitor the sermon joyeux that grew out of 
! ecclesiastical burlesques in France. The sug- 
I gestion, too, that many a fool's soliloquy in the 
' Elizabethan drama may be traced to the same 
source, is not only probable but may explain 
! the sophistical nonsense and parodied scholas- 
ticism of many such passages. Indeed, the 
whole chapter on " Secular By-Products in 
Satire and Wonder " is of special interest. The 
choice of the term " By-Products " is another 
illustration of the modernity of Professor Gay- 
ley's thought. His book is not only one to be 
commended to the scholar but to be enjoyed by 
the general readier. Lewis A. Rhoades. 



ROMAXCK OF THE AMERICAN FltOXTEEIt.* 



A generation ago, the names of BeatUe, of 
Headly, and of Marcy were associated in the 
minds of the reatling public ^vith stories of the 
Great Plains, with the savage nomads who in- 
fested them, and with the intermittent warfare 
waged between these natives and the invading 
whites. For a background, there was the bound- 
less sweep of the prairies ; for action, there was 
the pursuit of game or skirmishes between 
Indians and troops ; and pervading all was the 
air of mystery and wonder belonging to a new 
i and unknown land. These stories began with the 
opening of the Santa Fe and the Oregon trails ; 
they were enlarged by the discovery of gold and 
the rush to California ; and they ended only 
with the fuUer settlement of the Great West. 
This picturesque stage has now passed ; but its 
fascination has been many times reproduced bj' 
a re-telling of the border tales. In many re- 
spects the new settings are often superior to the 
old. Fremont and Kit Carson and " Buffalo

Bill " still play the leading roles ; the pony 
express, the overland mail, the midnight attack 
on the wagon train, furnish the same accessories ; 
but they are more systematically assembled, sup- 
plemented by stories of early exploration, and 
organized into a more comprehensive whole. 

The most recent of the many works dealing 
with this material is entitled " The Great Plains, 
a Romance of Western Exploration, Warfare, 
and Settlement," by Mr. Randall Parrish. Mr. 
Parrish has shown in previous publications, in 
both fact and fiction, his knowledge of the re- 
gions beyond the AUeghenies. The present effort 
lies in the category of his " Historic Illinois." 
It is history in a lighter vein ; history adapted 
to general reading. It makes no pretence to a 
source basis ; it is not free from minor inac- 
curacies ; it ha.s little attraction for the close 
student ; it bars footnote references ; and it col- 
lects the authorities in a brief "note of acknowl- 
edgement" following the Introduction. This 
list of authorities includes for the most part 
neither official document nor original narrative, 
but secondary descriptions like those of Hough, 
Chittenden, Inman, Bowles, Richardson, and 
Lummis. Mingled with these, however, will be 
found occasional excerpts from more serious 
writers — from Castenada's Journal, from H. H. 
Bancroft, and from Parkman. 

The volimie is best described as a collection 
of border stories and traditions, with running 
commentaries on contemporary conditions from 
the Spanish exploration to about 1870. The 
choice of material is commendable, the weaving 
skilful, and the interest well sustained. The 
excellent characterization of stages of Western 
development may be judged from the following 
extract, which is the concluding paragraph of 
the book. 

" It was a long, toilsome, aud perilous jouniey, from 
that f ar-otf time when Cabega de Vaea made his solitary 
pilgrimage amid his ' hump-backed oxen ' to the time 
of the invasion by Anglo-Saxon civilization. For thi-ee 
hundred and forty-three yeai's, those vast green Plains 
had been the scenes of struggle ; the sun of midday and 
the stars of midnight had watched the slow transfor- 
mation. The marching of troops under three banners; 
the desperate battles amidst the dreary buttes; the 
slow, sullen retreat of savagery; the stern advance of 
silent, persistent frontiersmen; the slow rolling cara- 
vans piercing the wilderness; the daring riders spurring 
their horses across the wide Plain ; the victim sobbing in 
torture ; the lost traveller praying in famine ; the white, 
dead faces upturned to the pitiless sky, — all that had 
been and gone. And then, out of the East, they came 
to take possession ; over the long miles, across the rivers 
and the prairies, eame the conquering Anglo-Saxons — 
men, women, children — armed with the plough and the 
spade, animated by the dogged resolution which is the 



inheritance of their race, thrilling to the thought of 
home and to the passion of possession. The hour and 
the man had come; the Great American Desert was a 
thing of the past. Le Roi est mart; vive le Roi!" 

The material chosen by Mr. Parrish falls 
naturally into three groups : the exploration of 
the Great Plains, the struggle for their posses- 
sion, and their occupation and settlement. In 
the first group appear Coronado and his Spanish 
fellow-explorers, Lewis and Clark, the fm-- 
traders, and the Santa Fe trailers. The second 
division embraces the stage coach, the pony 
express, and the border warfare following the 
Civil War down to 1870. Under the third head 
come the struggle for Kansas, the cattle kings, 
the Pacific railroads, mushroom towns, outlaws, 
and scouts. The volume has some spirited and 
interesting illustrations, presumably reproduc- 
tions, for the most part, from some older work.

The Futukk of Japan.* 



Mr. Watson, an English writer, who some 
time ago gave us a superior work on " Japan, 
its Aspects and Destinies," sends forth another 
volume of great interest to all who have w.atched 
the rise of a new power in the Pacific. His new 
book will meet a welcome from all who wish to 
know the present conditions and future prob- 
lems of Japan. 

Mr. Watson, being a thorough-going English- 
man, seems haunted by a fear that Japan may 
sweep all precedents aside and reverse the 
thought expressed by Tennyson's reference to a 
" cycle of Cathay," so that a subject of the 
Mikado may exclaim, " Better fifty years of 
Nippon than ages of Europe.' In much the 
same way, British wiseacres of the last century 
talked about the United States of America, 
which threw away thrones, kings, political 
churches, religious persecution, entail, and feu- 
dal I'elics generally. However, toward the end 
of his work Mr. Watson relieves us of our fears 
by showing that while Japan is still an Oriental 
nation she is on the whole too much like the 
Occidentals to startle us any further, or to upset 
the precedents of the ages. 

Readers of a scientific cast of mind will be 
likely to object to the metaphysical and even 
transcendental style of many of these pages, 
and deem them needless and inappropriate; 
while students of sociology and religion will

fmd in tbem mueh that is congenial, pleasing, 
and probably also satisfj-ing. The point of 
view of the writer is not that of the average 
intelligent citizen of the United States. The 
chapters have a strange air of reeluseness, as of 
an intelligent monk in the cloister, who knows 
books well. Is familiar with what has been said 
by the best minds on both sides of the subject, 
but who, after all, misses the key to the situa- 
tion, and, for the foundation of a rather lofty 
structure, omits what should be tried founda- 
tion-stones. 

In his preface, the author offers the homage 
doe to the achievements of those who have 
explored early Japanese historj-. But he does 
not seem to know that new workers have come 
into the field, both with the spade and with 
investigations among the Ainu — the white men 
who first inhabited the whole archipelago , and 
that Japanese history has been virtually recon- 
structed within the last half -decade. Nor is he 
entirely familiar with the movements of the phi- 
losophical Japanese mind in the eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries, and of the great men 
who planned the work which Ito and some of 
the ilikado's younger ser\-ants have but carried 
out. Further, when the author speaks of •' the 
sad, the sweet, the suffering Lafcadio Heam," 
as the " supreme interpreter of that Japan that 
is past," we beg at once to say that we differ 
in toto from the verdict. Herein, Mr. Watson 
reveals one of the great weaknesses of what is 
in some respects a strong and fascinating book. 
ilr. W. G. Aston, pioneer, veteran, scholar, 
and translator of the Nihongi (a. d. 720), has 
shown that Mr. Heam was entirely wrong in 
suppasing that ancestor-worship existed in prim- 
itive Japan. On page 8 of his just issued 
*' Shinto, the Ancient Religion of Japan " 
(London 1907). Mr. Aston shows that so far 
from •• Shinto or Ancestor-worship "' being the 
creed of the ancient inhabitants, as held by ilr. 
Heam and followed all the way through by Mr. 
Watson, such a notion is utterly without founda- 
tion and against the facts, ilr. Aston declares 
that the last and most valuable work of Mr. 
Heam, •• Japan, an Interpretation," is greatly 
marred by this misconception. Dr. G. W. Knox, 
in his truly scientific book, •• The Development 
of Religion in Japan," points out the same 
serious blunder into which foreign writers have 
fallen, following uncritic^al native ones by whom 
the allied ancestor-worship is orthodoxy sub 
po'na. As the ancient records show, ancestor- 
worship is imknown to the genuine early records, 
and was borrowed from the Chinese. In 



Japan, the worship of ancestors is a mediaeval 
production and a comparatively modem devel- 
opment. 

A more intimate acquaintance with the origins 
of the Japanese, who are a verj- mixed people, 
would have given a different form and spirit to 
the whole forecast of the future of the Japanese, 
as set forth in this book. If the author had 
learned from original sources the actual work- 
ings of the Japanese mind, and if he were more 
familiar with the inner movements of contem- 
porary Christian thought, with the details of 
missionary education and the lives of native 
preachers and Christian scholars, — and, in 
general, with the great transforming forces evi- 
dent in the press, the literature, and the life of 
the nation, especially since the outbreak of the 
war with Russia, — his opinions might have 
been quite different. It is doubtful if he would 
then have seen in the Japanese either a " Mon- 
golian " nation or an essentially " Oriental " 
people : still less would he have held that the 
intellect of the nation is dominated by ancestor- 
worship. 



Xew Ideas ox Edvcatiox.* 



We do not hesitate to prononnce Mr. Birdseye's 
•■ Individual Training in our Colleges " the most 
important book on edacation whieh has appeared in 
the last ten years. Any brief review of it most be 
so inadequate that one is almost tempted to begin and 
end by saying that it sboald be read by every man 
interested in colleges or universities in any capacity 
whatever. The author is not a college professor, 
nor a teacher, — indeed, so far as we know he has no 
official connection with any institution of learning, 
but b a lawyer in active practice in New York ; 
nevertheless, his book shows more knowledge, clearer 
vision, deepter devotion, and more rational hope 
regarding the American coU^e, than any other book 
we know of. 

Mr. Birdseye begins with a siu^ey of the earlier 
period of American higher education, with the par- 
pose of showing that the American college in earlier 
days was really a place for the individual training 
of the youth : narrow and bigoted the college doubt- 
less was. but the end sought was " the development 
of clear, strong moral character, according to the 
standards of the day. in every student : and so the 
spread of God's kingdom " (page 90). A similar

Building," shows the ahnost complete lapse of indi- 
vidual training and the removal of emphasis from 
the development of character to the cultivation of 
the intellect. 

The evils resulting from this change are many 
and crying. To their indictment Mr. Birdseye 
applies himself in no half-hearted fashion. 

" The former homogeneous and earnest hotly of poor stu- 
dentSf "who, under the sternest rules, were all fitting for one 
of the four learned or Latin professions . . , has been 
replaced by a motley and heterogeneous class, largely undis- 
ciplined and iingoverned mentally and morally, with no fixed 
idea of what they are to do in life except that they are to 
■ go into business.' . . . When they have asked us for some- 
thing that will make them successful and cultured bread- 
winners, we have gpiven them an ill-assorted, ill-begotten 
college course that is ' neither fish nor flesh, nor good red 
herring.' . . . We have put most of onr sentiment and money 
into the greatness of the institution, to the neglect of pre- 
paring each man for his future " (pp. 88-89). 

The decay of true university ideals, particularly 
the ideal of scholarship, is declared to be a result 
of the lack of individual training. In this connec- 
tion the author refers largely to the report of the 
Committee on Improving Instruction in Harvard Col- 
lege ; four times in this report the committee refers 
to the feeling on the part of the students that proper 
means are not taken to "keep them up in their 
work." Mr. Birdseye is particularly indignant at 
the common practice of practically ignoring a stu- 
dent's intellectual delinquency until it reached an 
intolerable degree and then dismissing him from the 
college. " Such waste of money, to say nothing of 
waste of men, would cost you your position," he says 
to the faculty. " in a well-nm mercantile house or 
factory " (p. 365). 

Concerning the abuses in athletics Mr. Birdseye 
finds it difficult to express himself adequately. 
There is perhaps nothing really new in this part of 
his book, but the truth is declared so vigorously that 
one gets a new strength of impression. 

" We spend scores of thousands of dollars upon athletes 
who really do not need further attention for their individual 
good, but should be encouraging their weaker brothere by 
working daily along with them " (p. 147). ''The awful fact 
is that for thirty years we have been debauching the moral 
characters of our college youths by helping them to devise 
and carry out the deceit, chicanery, dishonesty, and dishonor- 
ableness of modern intercollegiate athletics'" (p. 155). 

These are merely fragmentary specimens of the 
great indictment which Mr. Birdseye brings against 
the modern college. Let us hasten to say that he is 
no mere railing accuser. Himself a college graduate, 
he is in deepest sympathy with all the true ideals 
of higher education. From the athletic work, some 
features of which he condemns so unsparingly, he 
would have the college authorities learn a great les- 
son : the modern athletic coach is the one man who 
provides genuine individual training for the student. 
" In the student's opinion, the professional trainer 
has been the great problem-solver, and therefore he 
has been allowed to become dominant" (p. 237). 
To his example the membei-s of the faculties are 
referred, for it is by his methods that they must 
succeed. 



One of the most interesting ideas of the book is 
the conception of the college fraternity as the main 
substitute for the home life and training provided 
by the earlier American college. Mr. Birdseye is 
an enthusiastic Greek, and devotes to the fraternities 
not far from one-fourth of the whole book. 

"What then, is the conclusion of the whole matter !' 
Not idle regret, nor recrimination, nor carping criti- 
cism ; certainly not despair. The two words which 
indicate the means of solution are cooperation and 
devotion. " The problem is great, inmiinent, wide- 
spreading, and will prove too vast for any one 
of us alone or for divided forces. No time must 
be lost: let home-making influences cooperate with 
pedagogic ; alumni with faculty and trustees ; pa- 
rents with all the others ; and one and all with the 
undergi-aduate " (p. 381-82). 

Professor West's book entitled "American Lib- 
eral Education" consists of six papers prepared for 
special occasions, dealing with the American College 
and University. The first paper is a report of 
Princeton's experiment with the tutorial system: 
there is, perhaps necessarily, so much theory in 
educational discussions that a report of an actual 
experiment is refreshing. Professor West's verdict as 
to the experiment at Princeton is distinctively favor- 
able ; fortunately, he reports several definite results, 
which seem to demonstrate the good influence of 
the new system. First, the use of the University 
Library by undergraduates increased; and, more- 
over, the increase consisted mainly, not of light 
reading, but of books of history, philosophy, litera- 
ture, and science, — books, as Professor West says, 
that ought to be the natural reading of a man who 
calls himself a student. In the second place, con- 
versation on the campus has changed its char- 
acter. " Things intellectual are now in good form, if 
spoken of without affectation . . . even tangents 
and cosines sometimes fly around the campus. . . . 
I fully believe there is coming the recoveiy of the 
lost art of conversation" (pp. 22-23). Finally, the 
evenings at the University have taken on a different 
character, — more lights in the rooms, fewer stroll- 
ers, greater quietude. '• The atmosphere of study 
is brooding and settling over the old halls." 

The second paper, on the changing conception of 
the faculty in American universities, deals mainly 
with the relation of the faculty with the President, 
and concludes with the very rational proposal that 
the faculty should in general control the educational 
policy of the institution, but that the President should 
have the power to take any question for final settle- 
ment to the trustees or regents of the institution. 

In the third chapter, Professor West takes to 
task our standards of graduate work, finding that 
these standards are threatened just now by an unen- 
lightened specialization and a mania for publication, 
and as a result the publications are largely char- 
acterized by a sort of solemn pedantry. All this is 
doubtless so well known as to be almost trite, and yet 
so true and so important that we may well approve

the repetition. Would it not be well for some t«n- 
didate for a doctor's degree to make a study of 
doctors' theses with a view to showing the utter 
futility of the great majority of them? 

In the fourth paper the writer presents four perils 
which beset our system of liberal education. Here 
again the reader finds himself on very familiar 
ground. The first peril is commercialism, under 
which heading technical studies receive some criti- 
cism ; the second L"* illiteracy — in the sense of 
ignorance of good literature ; the third is " the 
disposition to do the pleasant rather than the hard 
thing": and the fourth, the peril of confusion in 
College councils, particularly respecting pre.«cribed 
and elective studies. 

Of the fifth paper, on the •• Length of the College 
Course," no special mention seems necessary ; the 
sixth, on the American College, was published for 
the Paris Exposition, and its contents are not new 
to intelligent Americans. 

Professor Tyler's recent book on '• Growth and 
Education " does not differ greatlj- in plan and gen- 
eral content from a considerable number of works 
on the physical development of the child : it comes, 
however, with rather unusual authority on account 
of the high scientific standing of the writer, and it 
is enriched by a broad view of the subject, and a 
certain warmth of treatment which adds greatly to 
the value of a book intended for teachers. There 
are several chapters of rather peculiar interest : that 
on " Man in the Light of Evolution "' presents very, 
briefly and clearly certain facts of evolution which 
are essential to any safe thinking on educational 
subjects. In " Hints irova Embrj-ologj- " there are 
gathered in one brief chapter some things which 
every teacher needs to know and which the unin- 
itiated would find hard to glean from other avail- 
able sources. In the chapter on "Mortality and 
Morbidity," Professor Tyler shows very clearly that 
statistics of death-rate, to which much attention has 
been paid, are of less value to the educator and 
hygienist than the facts concerning the contraction 
of the diseases which lead to death, a thing which 
probably took place months or even years before the 
actual death. 

WhUe the book deals mainly with bodily growth 
and development, the writer is led naturally by his 
subject into the field of moral and inteUectnal culture. 
He recognizes the importance of character-forming 
agencies in all periods, but justly emphasizes the high 
school as the time of final determination. 

■' Is even the development of a literary, historic, or scientific 
taste the chief end of the hi^h school ? Is there somethin|^ 
still higher, better suited to adolescent needs ? I believe 
that we will agree that the greatest homan need is complete 
devotion to the highest moral and religions ideals : and that 
character is formed early, at least in tendency. It usnally 
does not change essentially after the yonth is twenty years 
old. It will improve, grow and strengthen ; bnt the growth 
will be along lines already marked. In one word, character 
is formed in the high school and this is its period of most 
rapid development " (pp. 193-4). 



The book contains a valuable appendix, including 
tables of growth and vital statistics, and an extensive 
bibliography. We recommend it heartily for the 
library of every teacher. 

The growth of imiversity departments of education 
and of professional training for secondary teachers 
has for some time called for suitable text-books, 
which have not hitherto been forthcoming. We now 
have a work from the hand of Professor De Garmo, 
which will be of value in this respect. This is the 
first of two volumes on " The Principles of Secondary 
Education," and treats of - The Studies " ; the second 
is to treat of " Aims and Processes." 

What the present volume contains is briefly as 
follows : In the Introduction, the social basis and the 
individual basis of secondary education are discussed ; 
the social basis consists of the existing conditions of 
educational opportunity, and the consequent selection 
of the secondary pupils ; the individual basis is the 
character of the early adolescent, particularly his 
growing individuality, for which constant allowance 
must be made. Next, the studies of the secondary 
school are discussed, — their selection, classification, 
and value ; and, finally, the organization of the studies 
into currinda. The book contains valuable appen- 
dices, consisting mainly of typical curricula, proposed 
and actual, the latter including both Ameriesm and 
foreign ty^pes, and characteristic modern forms such 
as manual training and conmiercial high schools. 

It is evident that such a systematic treatment by 
an authority so competent and respected as Professor 
De Garmo will be welcomed by students of education 
in America, and particularly by teachers of the prin- 
ciples of secomlary education, who will find the book 
invaluable as text-book and reference. 

The Introduction sets forth the Presuppositions 
imderlj-ing American Secondary Education. We 
cannot but feel that the score of pages devoted to 
this subject is too little ; upon the principles here laid 
down must rest the whole discussion of the selection 
and treatment of studies, as well as the doctrines of 
school organization and discipline. We could wish 
that the sociological ideas involved in the first section 
had been more thoroughly clarified and related to 
the theme ; it is hard to see how the social classifi- 
cation quoted from Patten, of " dinger, sensualist, 
stalwart, and mugwump" (p. 7) is connected with 
the problem of secondary education ; indeed, the 
whole classification strikes one as not merely " fan- 
tastic nomenclature *' but a fantastic idea- 

The author recognizes the fact that the secondary- 
school deals with selected groups; but the fact 
that they are selected is of little significance unless 
we keep in mind to what end they are chosen and 

trained namely, for leadership. This dominant 

idea in all higher education, beginning with tlie high 
school, does not come into due prominence- We be- 
lieve that any true doctrine of the secondary school 
must be founded largely upon this idea; both the 
studies and the discipline must recognize this ; every

pupil should grow into a consciousness, not of priv- 
ilege, but of duty, — to think more clearly, act more 
wisely and strongly, and serve his day and genera- 
tion more fully, than his fellows who have been 
denied the higher training bestowed upon him. 

The second section of the Introduction deals with 
the individual basis; that is, the nature of the 
adolescent period. The reader who shares the ten- 
dency of the times to consider this period extraor- 
dinary in character and preeminent in importance 
will be disappointed with the scanty eight pages 
here devoted to it, and that without mention of two 
of the most significant elements in the period — the 
development of sex, and the rise of vocational im- 
pulses and ideas. 

To the student of the history of education since 
the Revival of Learning, one of the momentous 
fact.s is the passing of Latin and Greek as the sole 
vehicle of knowledge and culture, and the rise of 
literature and science in the vernacular tongues. 
To liim, the keynote of a discussion concerning the 
value of the ancient languages in education may well 
be put in Professor De Garmo's own words : " The 
more a given group of studies is urged as a necessity 
in education, the more imperative becomes the need 
of determining its inherent worth, lest the tradi- 
tional estimate of its value be over or under rated " 
(p. 103). We cannot resist the conviction that the 
author has not lived up to this principle with respect 
to the study of foreign and especially ancient lan- 
guages in the secondary school. The reasons for 
this conviction cannot be given here in full ; one 
fact is, however, suggestive : eighteen pages are 
devoted to linguistics, five to literature in general, 
one to literature in the mother tongue. Nor can 
we feel that this is an accident, but rather that it 
is indicative of the real attitude of the discussion. 
Truly, we have wandered far from the educational 
ideals of our spiritual ancestors the Greeks ! 

The style is everywhere clear and readable, and 
the make-up of the book is satisfactory, in spite 
of a few typographical errors. One or two minor 
criticisms may be suggested : on page 129 we should 
surely read hundreds instead of " thousands of years 
ago "; it is not clear why the OherreaZschule is 
omitted from the list of German secondary schools

JSurope after 
the downfall 
of Napoleon. 



For the ordinary student, the period 
of the Restoration, coming after the 
tragic and spectacular collapse of the 
Napoleonic empire, seems fiUed with dreary details 
of petty repression. A closer scrutiny has credited 
it with some distinguishing merits, — the preserva- 
tion of peace for a half-century, so necessary for the 
restorative process in the higher sense of the word. 
Still more important was the silent administrative, 



industrial, and commercial revolution which was far 
advanced before the period ended. In the new vol- 
ume of the "Cambridge Modern History" (Mac- 
millan) which treats The Restoration, these features 
are properly emphasized. This is especially true of 
the chapters on France and Germany, by Professor 
Bourgeois and Professor Pollard. Professor PoUard 
evidently believes that the work of administrative 
and commercial reform was, for the scattered prov- 
inces of Prussia, more essential than the g^'ant of 
a parliamentary system of government. The vol- 
ume also contains a special chapter on " Economic 
Change," but so much of positive fact is crowded 
into its thirty-five pages as nearly to smother definite 
impressions. As in previous volumes of this series, 
foreigners have been called upon for contributions 
within their fields. In addition to Professor 
Bourgeois, there are Dr. Askenazy for Russia and 
Poland, Professor Segi-fe for Italy, and Professor 
Altamira for Spain. This diversity of authorship 
results occasionally in an embarrassing diversity of 
views. For example. Lady Blennerhasset writes 
that the policy of Consalvi " impressed upon the 
Papal restoration a stamp of high statesmanship 
and moderation," while Professor Segre remarks 
that " The Church had restored a government far 
more despotic [than that of the Aiistrians in Lom- 
bardy], and rendered more destructive and oppres- 
sive by its internal confusion — a blind, changeable 
and capricious government," etc. Again, referring 
to the period after the commotions of 1830, whUe 
Professor Segrfe characterizes Louis Philippe's 
Italian policy as " timid " and " uncertain," Profes- 
sor Bourgeois thinks the Citizen King steered amidst 
the rocks of foreign intervention with consummate 
skill and foresight. In the present volume there are 
chapters which fill lacunae left in the two earlier 
volumes, notably the chapter of Mr. Kirkpatrick on 
the Spanish Dominions in America, which intro- 
duces his chapter on the Establishment of Inde- 
pendence in Spanish America. The chapters on 
English and German literature also cover much of 
the eighteenth century. If there appears less unity 
in this volume, because there is no great central fig- 
ure or theme, it nevertheless possesses sound utility. 



To most readers, Jean Rotrou is 
;/Co"Sr'"" little more than a name; to some 

he is not even that. Born in 1609, 
three years after Corneille. his literary career was 
begun and finished before that of his glorious rival. 
Rotrou's first play M-as produced in 1628, Corneille's 
in 1629. His last drama is dated 1649, Corneille's 
1674. The author of Le Cid called the author 
of Saint Gen-est "his father." In fact, Corneille 
absolutely eclipsed Rotrou, of whose thirty-five 
plays two only are now remembered, read, and 
sometimes acted. These plays are now offered 
for the first time to students of French, by Prof. 
T. F. Crane, who has done much to direct the 
public into untrodden literary fields. His choice of 
Saint Genest and Venceslas is a most judicious

one. By fiaaitg side by side Saint Gtnest and 
Polyeuete, whieh treat the same sabject, we ean 
measure the distance separating a clever second- 
rate dramatist from a plaj-wright of real genius. As 
for VencesLas. it was verj- much admired during 
the eighteenth century. Voltaire considered some 
parts of it masterly; it was acted by Lekain 
and Talma, and given at various theatres until 
1875. Saint Genest. more popular in our day, 
was put on the stage of the Od^on as late as 1900. 
In their general treatment and atmosphere both 
plays differ so much from the pure classieal trage- 
dies that Emile Deschanel has found in them " some- 
thing Shakespearian," while Sainte-Beuve consid- 
ered them the forerunners of the Romantic move- 
ment. " Saint Genest is, in the midst of the seven- 
teenth century, the most Romantic play imaginable." 
Undoubtedly this flavor of modernism, this bold 
mixture of the tragic and the comic, so marked in 
these *' tragi-comedies." will appeal to the readers 
whom the monotonous solemnity of the classieal 
drama sometimes wearies. In his 135 page intro- 
duction, the editor has well brought out the char- 
acteristics of the two plays. The picture of the 
condition of the French drama before 1636 — the 
date of Le Cid — the account of Rotrou's life and 
literary activity, his tragic death during the plague 
at Dreux. the illuminating study of his style and ver- 
sification, which applies to the whole seventeenth 
centnr}- tragedy, the estimates of all the critics from 
Voltaire to Brunetiere, will be found entertaining 
and instructive by the general reader. Only the 
special student, however, will care for the detailed 
comparison with the Spanish models, and the extracts 
in the appendix. The notes are extremely useful 
for the understanding of the style of the period, and 
as complete as could be desired: the bibliography 
covers all that is of prime importance on the subject. 
This edition of Rotrou, prepared with the minute 
conscientiousness shown in the other works of the 
same author, is the result of several years' labor 
and travel. It will be indispensable to all who care 
to study French tragedy at its sources. Published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co., Boston. 

BobeH Otctn. Robert Owen might have ranked 
tactaUttemd among the best-^nown philanthro- 
pluUmikropiM. pigj^ <,£ jh^ ^^j^. part of the last 
century if he had not embraced in his views com- 
munism and various heterodoxies. As it was. he 
ran the whole gamut of socialism. Profit-sharing, 
cooperation, education of chUdren, child-labor, trades- 
unions, communities, spiritualism, all came within 
his realm of social reform and reorganization. At 
one time the head of the labor-commnnitj- at New

in a community at New Harmony. Indiana ; offered 
the freedom of the House of Representatives' haU at 
Washington for a lecture which was attended even ! 
by the -President of the United States : and later 
atta(^ed by the clergy of England, insulted, and i 
mobbed in the "holy war." Owen furnishes a bio- 



graphical writer with abundant material for de- 
scription and pieturesqueness. To the several lives 
of Owen in various languages. Mr. Frank Podmore 
has added an excellent and well-balanc«d biography 
in two large volumes with numerous illustrations 
(Appleton). The author does not approach his 
subject with zeal for any cause he represented, nor 
with a spirit of eulogy, but gives a fair picture of 
the man in his strength of individual persistence and 
his weakness of impracticability. Large resea^^ 
was neeessary to the eomfJete sketches the antlior 
gives of the various enterprises with which Owen was 
connected, and this is shown also in the appended 
bibliography. Owen's theories are deduced from 
his various writings and lectures, but not introduced 
in sufficient quantity to cause tediousness or distrac- 
tion. In short, the two volumes furnish an excellent 
example of what unbiased and tmprejudiced biog- 
raphy should be. Comparisons with modern prob- 
lems of child-labor and conditions of workingmen 
are inevitable in the reader's mind, and modem 
improved conditions are appreciated when one reads 
that at New Lanark Owen found in his newly 
purchased cotton mills no less than five hundred 
children apprenticed from the parish workhouse. 
At the same time, one queries how modem work- 
men would take Owen's method of hang^g beside 
each spinner a wooden paddle painted to show his 
conduct on the preceding day, — t. c, white for 
" excellent," yellow for " good," blue for " indif- 
ferent," and black for ''bad." Mr. Podmore's work 
will be found of value to students of present social 
conditions, as well as to those interested in early 
history in the Middle West of America. 

No one should be deterred by the 
^ J^pwu sensational title from reading Lieo- 

tenant Saknrai's recital of his expe- 
riences in the campaign against Port Arthur. By 
" Human Bullets " — a figure of speech characteris- 
tically Japanese — he signifies the masses of living 
men that were hurled against the fortifications guard- 
ing the stronghold in desperate attempts to carry 
them by storm. The book is a soldier's story of wh^ 
he witnessed with his own eyes from the time he left 
home untQ he fell grievously woimded and was left for 
dead on the field. In Japan it reached its forty-first 
thousand within a year of its publication, and the 
Emperor, in token of his appreciation, bestowed 
upon the author the signal honor of a private audi- 
ence. It has been translated into Russian, French, 
and German, and now appears in an English ver- 
sion (Houghton). The narrative, presented in a 
series of vivid word-pictures.' is impressive from its 
sincerity. There is no boasting, no attempt at self- 
glorification. Instead, there breathes throughout the 
spirit of lofty devotion to duty that made General 
Nogi's army invincible. The sense of personal 
responsibility for the outcome of the war, that was 
felt by all from the highest to the lowest, is a domi- 
nant note, constantly recurring. Since some must

counting it the greatest of honors should he be one 
of those privileged to make the supreme sacrifice 
of giving his life for his country. We are shown 
something of the appalling horror of war as seen 
by the man in the ranks, but this is not dwelt upon 
unduly. The things brought into prominent relief 
are the intense patriotism of the army and the rela- 
tion that existed between officers and men, which 
we are told was exceedingly close and tender, and 
akjn to that between parents and children. Con- 
sidering the great difficulty of finding PInglish 
phrases to give the exact meaning of the original, 
the translation has been very well done, though 
occasionally the choice of words is not happy. No 
review of the work would be quite complete without 
some reference to the colored frontispiece, repro- 
duced from a drawing made by the author with 
his left hand after he had lost his right in the war. 
The spirited composition and the force and suavity 
of the brush-strokes indicate decided artistic talent. 

Now that all the world goes a-travel- 

ira^Jil'Zk! ^ing' tl»e tjays of the machine-made 
popular guides to the art, architecture, 
literary memorials, and scenery of Europe are num- 
bered. Excellent in their place, they must find that 
place narrowing with every summer's invasion of 
Europe by the reading public of America. It is 
therefore a pleasure to discover that Miss Betham- 
Edwards's " Literary Rambles in France " (McClurg) 
belongs, not to the appalling multitude of " popular 
guides," but to the small and delightful company 
of artistic and illuminating travellers' sketches. 
They have, in the first place, the note of spontaneity. 
Their author is an English woman, but an ojfficier de 
I'instruction pviilique of France, and is naturally 
quite at home in the domain of French letters. In 
like manner her travels in France are leisurely and 
intimate wanderings, covering many years and all 
seasons, enjoyed with rare insight, and described in 
a suggestive fashion that, far from exhausting the 
resources of the subject, hints at unrevealed charms, 
whets the reader's appetite, and makes him resolve 
to take the earliest opportunity of seeing Flaubert's 
<{uaint study at Croisset, of summering where 
Michelet wrote " La Mer," of penetrating the Brit- 
tany of Emile Souvestre, of going " On the Track of 
Balzac" to Limoges, Angouleme, and Saumur, and 
•' In the Footsteps of George Sand " to La Chatre 
and Nohant, and then to the Bibliotheque Nationale, 
where the correspondence of George Sand and 
Alfred de Musset is preserved. The chapter about 
these letters is entitled " A Last Word about George 
Sand," and is a delightful character sketch. The 
chapter on " Flaubert's Literary Workshop " is, after 
two or three pages of description, a brilliant study 
of temperament and of the literary methods that 
reveal it. "-1 always object to making a toil of 
pleasure, and am the most incurious traveller alive," 
confesses Miss Betham-Edwards, a propos of some 
unexplored grottoes. But she gets to the heart of the 
matter, as more curious travellers seldom take the 



pains to do, and we are willing to leave it to her 
whether her chapters shall contain a greater measure 
of literary reminiscence or of traveller's lore. The 
book is discriminatingly illustrated, — we are glad 
not to be obliged to use the conventional adjective, 
fuUy, in this connection, — and is bound in a style 
at once artistic and dignified.

attorney who defended the students 
recently barred out of the San Fran- 
cisco schools, makes an attempt to bring to "mil- 
lions of American homes " knowledge of Japan and 
Japanese conditions, in a work entitled " The Life 
of Japan " (Baker-Taylor Co.). Apparently the book 
is the outcome of many questions put to the author 
by well-meaning but not well-informed people whom 
he has met during his residence in this country. 
The religions, " moral ethics," customs, and habits of 
the Japanese people, and the salient features of the 
history of Nippon, are briefly reviewed ; and inter- 
spersed between the chapters are quotations from 
distinguished writers, with translations of poems, 
chiefly from the " Manyef ushif u " and other classics. 
As might naturally be expected, there are some 
amusing errors of diction, as in the reference to 
works on the scenery of Japan : " This kind of book 
is quite harmless, for it is merely the making of 
a picture gallery or conemetograph ; " and again : 
" August ... is the time the temperature on the 
summit of Fuji can be tolerated when it is reached." 
The navve acceptance of such legends as the simul- 
taneous formation of Mount Fuji and Lake Biwa 
in the year 286 b. c. would hardly be echoed by 
scholars. For the most part, however, the book is 
accurate and well suited to the needs of readers who 
do not care to go deeply into the subjects treated. 
To such it may be commended in the hope that it 
may, as the author desires, help to promote friendly 
feeling between the people of America and Japan. 

Practical hint. Experiences in giving talks about old

that a large amount of good Chinese porcelain is 
owned by persons who know nothing at all about its 
characteristic beauties or its value. She has accord- 
ingly prepared a manual on the subject for amateur 
students and collectors, entitled " How to Identify 
Old Chinese Porcelain " ( McClurg). Mrs. Hodgson 
does not attempt to be either exhaustive or original. 
She professes indebtedness to a variety of writers of 
more elaborate and expensive works, and refers her 
readers to them and to certain great ceramic collec- 
tions for more complete knowledge. Mrs. Hodgson 
leaves anecdotes and personalities alone, and attends 
strictly to the business of classifying glazes and 
pastes, describing styles, colors, decorations, and 
date-marks of typical specimens, explaining what 
is meant by " crackle," how to distinguish between 
Chinese and English " blue," and how to know 
Oriental " Lowestoft " from English. A careful

study of her brief and accurately worded chapters 
should enable the beginner to view collections, 
classify his own specimens, and buy others, with a 
fair amount of intelligence ; and this is more than 
he could do after perusing many more ambitious but 
less systematic treatises. 

Heipt.nrwand In the "Book of the "Wisdom of 
uring a'nd Solomon " it is written, " And if a 

thinking. man love righteousness, her labors are 

virtues ; for she teacheth temperance and prudence, 
justice and fortitude : which are such things as men 
can have nothing more profitable in their life." 
With these words Mr. Paul Revere Frothingham 
opens the first chapter of his book of essays, or ser- 
mons, entitled '* The Temple of Virtue " (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.). The emphasis placed on these 
cardinal virtues by Plato and Aristotle is pointed out, 
and their nature is explained and illustrated in the 
succeeding chapters. But the final discourse. " The 
Altar of Love," calls attention to the pagan blindness 
to the highest virtue of all, love — the love of God 
and one's neighbor. The book is a help to right 
living, and it is written in an unpretentious and 
pleasing style, with occasional apt quotations from 
Bacon, Harnack, Aquinas. Paulsen, Franklin, 
Pausanias, and a considerable range of other writers, 
ancient and modern. Unity of design, however, 
holds together all this variety of detail, and each 
chapter is succinct, simple, and direct. The little 
volume can be read pleasantly and profitably at a 
single sitting, or it can be digested piecemeal. 

The moral Under the title of " Shakespeare as 

tvtem of a Dramatic Thinker " (Macmillan), 

Shakcprare. Professor Richard G. Moulton has 
re-issued his " Moral System of Shakespeare " 
(reviewed in The Dial for November 16, 1903). 
A new introduction has been supplied : otherwise, 
except for slight alterations in phraseology, the book 
remains unchanged. Up to a certain point, the 
author is undoubtedly right in his contention that 
Shakespeare's plots reveal his attitude toward the 
problems of life ; but one must observe carefully 
wherein Shakespeare followed his sources and 
wherein he intentionally modified his stories. The 
weakness of the book lies chiefly in just this neglect 
of the oft<lespised sources. The reputation of the 
work as suggestive and stimulating is of course de- 
served, and it will doubtless long continue to serve 
as a useful guide in a fruitful kind of study. 



XOTES. 



The Macmillan Co. publish a new edition, in two 
volumes as before, of Mr. Philip Alexander Bruce 's very 
valuable " Economic History of Virginia in the Seven- 
teenth Century." 

"A Student's Historj- of Philosophy," by Professor 
Arthur Kenyon Rogers, is a work now six years old, 
and has attained the dignity of a new revised edition. 
It is published by the Macmillan Co. 



" A Tennyson Calendar," selected by Miss Amut 
Harris Smith, makes a small book published by Messrs. 
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. A companion volume is 
" A Christmas Anthology " of poems and carols. 

Three pretty booklets published by Messrs. Du£Beld 
& Co. give us, respectively, Lincoln's inaugural and 
Gettysburg address, FitzGerald's Omar Khayyam, and 
" The Canticle of the Sun " by St. Francis of Assisi. 

" Adventures of Uncle Sam's Soldiers "' is the title 
given to a new volume in " Harper's Adventure Series." 
There are a dozen stories, and among their authors are 
Julian Ralph, John Habberton, and Gen. Charles King. 

A monograph on " The JEsthetic Doctrine of 
Montesquieu," by Dr. Edwin Preston Dargan, is pub- 
lished by the J. H. Furst Co., Baltimore. It is a Johns 
Hopkins doctoral dissertation of the normal type, and 
of something more than the normal interest. 

Professor Earle W. Dow's " Atlas of European 
History," published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., is a 
volume of moderate dimensions, and, of course, better 
than its predecessors because it embodies the latest 
political arrangements of Europe, Asia, and Africa. 

The poems of the late Richard Hovey are now pub- 
lished by Messrs. Duffield & Co. in a neat set d ux 
volumes, five of which are devoted to the several parts 
of the dramatic cycle " Laimcelot and Guenevere." The 
sixth volume is " Along the Trail," a collection of vaga- 
bond lyrics. 

An edition of " Grace Abounding" and " The Klgrim's 
Progress," included in a single volume, is now added to 
the " Cambridge English Classics," of which the Messrs. 
Putnam are the American publishers. Dr. John Brown 
has edited the text from the most complete editions. 

Dr. Charles Seignobos's " History of Medieval and of 
Modem Civilization," in a translation made by Professor 
James Alton James, is pubhshed by the Messrs. Scribner. 
This is the second of a series of three volumes which 
will reproduce, altogether, the essential parts of the 
author's " Histoire de la Civilisation." 

Miss Laura £. Lockwood offers to the academic 
public a " Lexicon to the English Poetical Works of 
John Milton," the result of labors extending over a 
dozen years. The usefulness of such a work to literary 
students is so obvious that no comment is needed. The 
pages are double-coliunned, and there are nearly seven 
hundred of them. The Macmillan Co. are the publishers. 

The H. W. Wilson Co., Minneapolis, publish a 
" Swedish Grammar and Reader," the work of Professor 
J. S. Carlson. This is a book that has been much 
needed, and does for the student of Swedish what 
Professor Juhus Olson's similar work does for the 
student of Norwegian. The selections which fill the 
"reader" section of the volume are judiciously made 
and of much interest. 

The Messrs. Putnam, who, soon after the death of 
Frederick Law Olmsted, had the good judgment to 
republish his narrative of " A Journey in the Seaboard 
Slave States," have now continued the good work then 
begun by following it with a new edition of " A Journey 
in the Back Country." This work, Uke its predecessor, 
fills two large volumes. It was originally issued in 1860, 
and the experiences which it relates date six or seven 
years further back. As time goes on, these books will 
become more and more important to the historian, and 
it is safe to predict that the late twentieth century wUl 
think of them, and use them, as we now use and think 
of the books of Arthur Young.

JUST READY — THE SECOND SECTION OF 

Penite 

Its Individual Growth from the 

Earliest Beginnings to the 

Fall of the Republic 

By POMPEO MOLMENTI 

Translated from the Italian by 

HORATIO F. BROWN, author of 

" In and Around Venice," etc. 

n^HIS imposing work is issued in three sections of two volumes each. 
-*- The author is the leading historical writer in Italy at the present 
time. The translator is himself an authority on Venice, with the repu- 
tation of knowing more about Venice than any other living English- 
man. The volumes are distinguished typographically by being printed 
in the beautiful Italian type, cut by Bodoni, which was so famous a 
century ago and has recently been revived by the University Press. 

NOW READY 





Part I., VENICE IN THE MIDDLE AGES. 



Part II., VENICE IN THE GOLDEN AGE. 



READY FALL 1908 
Part III., THE DECADENCE OF VENICE. 



"It is remarkable and hardly credible that so 
excellent a work should have waited so long for an 
English version ; and yet the delay has brought its 
compensations, for during all this time Signor Mol- 
menti has been adding to his knowledge of his subject 
and to his book, so that he is now able to present the 
latest and in many cases the definitive statement. 
Moreover, the invention and the perfecting of process 
engraving have made it possible for the publishers 
of this work to illustrate it properly, at a cost which 
would not have been dreamed of earlier. And 
Horatio Brown, himself /afzV^ princeps among living 
British knowers, lovers, and historians of Venice, has 
been secured to put Signor Molmenti's exuberant 
Italian into sound English prose. More than passing 
notice should be made of the illustrations of this work. 
They are chosen wisely to illustrate every part of the 
text, — views of buildings, maps, facsimiles of draw- 
ings, half-tones of paintings and sculptures, and 
reproductions of illuminations. The work should 
appeal with equal force to the general reader and the 
specialist." — The Evening Post (New York). 



"The new volumes deal with the Golden Age of 
this great commercial empire, every portion of the 
daily life of the Venetians, their government and their 
art being discussed with the authority that has won 
such high praise for the preceding part of the work. 
The typographical beauty of this book, 'with the admir- 
able binding and attention to mechanical details, 
adds a ivorthy chapter to the history of American 
publishing." — Publishers' Weekly (Nov. 2). 

' ' The first section comprises two attractive volumes 
of about five hundred pages, provided with a large 
number of excellent illustrations. Of the translator's 
work so far as it has been completed, the reviewer's 
criticism must be favorable throughout. ' ' — The Dial. 



"One may place these volumes, in good faith, on 
the shel'ves njvith those histories ivhich endure the test 
of time." — The Chicago Tribune. 

Six volumes, 8vo ; each volume with frontispiece in gold and colors, and 
many illustrations. Sold only in two-volume sections, per section $5.00 net.

THE CRIMSON CONQUEST 

|N his story, just published under the title of 
"The Crimson Conquest," Charles B. Hudson 
has utilized to the full the glamour and magnifi- 
cence of this to us almost mythical age. Since 
Lew Wallace wrote " The Fair God," novelists 
have neglected the romantic period of the Span- 
ish subjugation of the peoples of Central and 
South America. Few episodes in history offer 
more dramatic possibilities than the advent of 
Pizarro's band of freebooters among the peace- 
ful tribes of Peru. " This tale is of days when 
the green forest-aisles and mountain trails of 
America saw the glint of the steel of men in 
armor. It has to do with times when the abo- 
rigine looked upon the sparkle of lance, the 
flutter of pennon, the gleam of corselet, helm, 
and morion, and felt his primeval turf tremble 
beneath the hoofs of steeds in full panoply. It 
tells of plumed and plated cavaliers, who found 
in the wilderness of the New World adventures no less hardy, and near as 
strange, as any fabled one encountered by knight of old." The heroine is a 
daughter of that Inca of Peru whom Pizarro so shamelessly did to death, and 
sister to his successor on the throne ; the hero, one of the bravest of Pizarro's 
doughty following, a knight of Castile. 




"Most remarkable is it, and doubly welcome, nhen the highest standard of excellence is approached by 
the first volume of one to fame unknown. To this dignity of precedence arises Charles B. Hudson's ' The 
Crimson Conquest,' a stately romance of the Incas at the zenith of their splendor. In intensity of interest 
he surpasses a famous predecessor in his field, Prescott, prince of chroniclers, for with the same fidelity to history, 
Hudson has redrawn the grim shapes of atrocities practiced upon the superstitious and practically defenceless 
Children of the Sun. but has intertwined with the piteously true detail of Castilian pillage and perfidy the love 
story of the Princess Rava and the Spanish Captain, Cristoval. The treachery of his leader, by which the 
captive Inca Atahualpa was put to ignominious death after delivering the price of his promised freedom, 
made Cristoval an ally of the oppressed Peruvians. Assisted by Pedro, the cook, he escaped the death 
penalty of sedition, rescued Princess Rava from Rogelio, the wheedling Veedor, and effected an adventurous 
flight to sanctuary across the Andes."— A'anja/ City Star.

THE MASTERPIECES OF ENGLISH 
XARRATIVE VERSE. 



It has long been a thought of mine that a collec- 
tion should be made of the best specimens of English 
narrariTe verse, corresponding to the many anthol- 
ogies of lyric and ballad poetrj-. To do this 
adequately would require that some of the crown 
jewels of English literature should be torn from their 
settings — that the epics and long poems should 
be dismembered. Sacrilege this, but perhaps the 
fragments would show to as much advantage in 
juxtaposition with rival pieces as they do in their 
present frameworks. 

Lyric poetry we have always with us. It is so 
much the natural language of the human heart, so 
much the necessary iiistnm[ient of personality, that 
one cannot imagine it ever becoming unfashionable 
or obsolescent. The drama, too. holds its own, partly 
by help of the stage and partly by its own inherent 
virtue, as the most concentrated form by which action 
can be presented. We cannot afford to neglect the 
drama of the past, though we may refuse to pay any 
attention to the plays of the present. But epic and 
narrative poetry have fallen upon evil days. They 
have suffered far more than the other two supreme 
forms of verse by the competition of the novel and 
the short story. Verse undoubtedly makes greater 
demands upon a reader than prose. To read a 
novel is as easy as to forget it. To read verse 
requires either an instinct or an education. But its 
stamp endures. It has form, where prose has merely 
force. It ha£ architecttiral symmetry, sculpturesque 
outline, color, and music — qualities which are only 
faintly present in prose. The vast increase of readers 
among the untrained and flabby-minded is respoA- 
sible for the present occultadon of portry. They 
follow the line of least resistance, and read what 
gives them the least trcmUe. And some of our chief 
American pro*emen, who ought to know better, take 
advantage of this condition and affect to speak super- 
ciliously of verse. They talk mysteriously of their 
" new art," of the '' more subtle methods " of their 
prose, and relegate the eternal forms of literature to 
the garret as outworn lumber. The casual observer 
can see no new art in their books, only an art as old 
as commonplace has always been, and a method as 
obvious as mediocrity has always used. It is hard 
to convince one that a photographic albimi of an 
ordinary American faniUy is a more valuable 
national possession than the Vatican or UflBzi gal- 
leries. It is not difBcult to cut off seventeen yards 
of pump-water and call it a novel, or to string 
together vague phrases and solemn puffery and call 
it an essay. Even the really great prose works of

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



our language have not the form of adamant and soul 
of fire of the great poems. The best of our novels, 
if brought into competition with " Paradise Lost," 
would disappear like the serpents of the Magi before 
Aaron's animated rod. The best of our short stories 
would show like shadows beside the white enchant- 
ment of " Christabel " or the glowing splendor of 
"The Eve of St. Agnes." 

A collection such as I suggest would have to begin 
with Chaucer. Langland's " Piers Plowman " is, 
for any practical purpose, not English ; and Beowulf 
and the great Welsh and Irish legends and epics are 
not English at all. What poet better than Chaucer 
for the fore-front of such a book ? The morning 
freshness, the spring vitality of his landscape, the 
lusty vigor and naturalness of his people, would open 
the collection with a thrill and tingle of life. The 
Prologue to the " Canterbury Tales " to show his 
humor and creative force, the " Knight's Tale," per- 
haps somewhat condensed, to show his romantic 
strain and the richness of his verse, and the 
" Prioress's Tale " to show his pathos, would be my 
selections. 

English narrative verse leaps from Chaucer to 
Spenser, — from the realist with romance in his 
blood, to the idealist touched with the love of the 
flesh and the adornments thereof. Spenser's sen- 
suousness, however, is at second-hand ; it is the 
mirrored reflection of great galleries of pictures, 
rather than of the wide world itself. The opening 
canto of " The FaSrie Queene," the canto describing 
the garden of Acrasia, and one dealing with 
Britoraart, Spenser's most brilliant heroine, would 
be a fair representation. 

The vast mass of Elizabethan verse would hardly 
yield more than one poem, Marlowe's " Hero and 
Leander." It is a translation, but it has all the 
merits of an original, and it glows like a clear star 
amid the fogs and clouds of Daniel, Drayton, and 
the other epic writers of the time. Shakespeare's 
two narrative pieces show the crescent might of the 
master's hand, but they are encumbered and tire- 
some and altogether unable to hold their own with 
the work of the real story-tellers. 

Again there is a wide gap, until we come to Milton. 
I would choose the first four books of "Paradise 
Lost," and should think it no irreverence to the great 
poet to tear them from their place. In the rest of 
the work we are moving in a high region ; but we 
are hardly conscious of the height, and we are 
conscious of many inequalities and dreary wastes. 
The first precipitous rising of the eternal peaks, the 
outlook over Ulimitable horizons, are lost to us. If 
nothing remained of the poem but the scenes in hell 
and the opening view of paradise, we would gaze in 
wonder on the unparallelled fragments and declare 
that the hand that wrought them was the mightiest 
in the history of literature. 

Dryden's superb and manly genius hardly ever 
showed to greater advantage than in the Fables of 
his old age. Of these I should choose " Theodore 



and Honoria " and " Cymon and Iphigenia." I do 
not see how we could do without the whole of Pope's 
" Rape of the Lock," a work so brilliant in design 
and execution, so airy in invention, and so studded 
with glittering lines and passages, that it is mere 
pedantry to refuse it homage as a poem. Artificial 
it is, of course ; but it is Nature which makes that 
art, as Shakespeare assures us. Fops and bells, and 
powder-puffs and silver buckles, are all in the uni- 
versal round. 

The main force of eighteenth-century verse in 
England was diverted from the three primitive forms 
of poetry into satire, didactic and descriptive work. 
Great things were done in these, but not until the 
Romantic Revival came in sight did creative art in 
poetry again rear its head. 

Aside from his songs, Burns is a satiric and 
didactic writer. Only his "Tam O'Shanter" could 
be gathered into our casket. Wordsworth in the 
main is didactic and descriptive, yet he would yield 
us at least three narrative pieces — " Michael," 
" Hart-Leap Well," and '* Laodamia." Hazlitt gave 
his vote for two lines of the last-named piece as the 
best in the language. The whole poem is of solemn 
and ineffable beauty. Goethe's " Bride of Corinth," 
a piece far superior to Wordsworth's in di-araatic 
effect and story-telling technique, is a mere fool to 
it in depth and compelling power. 

Coleridge's " Christabel " and the " Rime of the 
Ancient Mariner " are two pinnacles of pure art. In 
them the absolute, the perfect simplicity of word 
and cadence, is substituted for style, and the mys- 
terious utterance of impassioned reverie for thought. 
Coleridge is the inspired bard, the true descendant 
of the Druids. I think there can be no doubt as to 
his original, though perhaps vague, plan for the 
completion of " Christabel." How could the child, 
the " limber elf " of the wonderful concluding lines, 
have got into the poem if he had no meaning ? 

Scott's poetry is a good deal better than it gets 
credit for being. It is not made out of the original 
elements, as the poetry of Chaucer and Burns is, — 
at least those elements are fused and distilled in an 
alchemist's retort, in the hope to get something finer 
than Nature. But the product is healthful and 
invigorating. One might take from him the first 
canto of the " Lay," the first canto of the " Lady of 
the Lake," and the last canto of " Marmion." 

The great personality of Byron — a volcano which 
spouted fire and ashes over Europe, whose track can 
be traced to this day — required a personal form of 
expression. His greatest work is autobiographic or 
satiric. He did not take much interest in anybody 
but himself, and so was unfit for the drama or the 
epic. Yet " The Vision of Judgment," while it is 
satire, is also magnificent narrative. " The Prisoner 
of Chillon " has a sombre gi'eatness, and the Haid^e 
book of " Don Juan " is enchantingly beautiful. 

The Northern Lights of Shelley's verse — thin, 
wavering, unsubstantial — did not concentrate into 
any solid epic creation. Probably his best narrative

work is the translation of the Homeric "Hrnm to 
Hermes," where the Greek original kept him within 
meAsnr&ble reach of reality. '^ Jnlian and Maddalo " 
has fine lines and passages, and a brooding depth 
of tone. '• The Sensitive Plant " is characteristically 
and entirely Shelleyan. 

The "Hyjjerion" of Keats seems to me the per- 
fect model of English narrative verse. Greek where 
Milton is Asiatic, plastic where Coleridge is vision- 
ary, manly where Tennyson b feminine, he is, in 
mere manner, nearer than anvone else to the Ionian 
father of them alL His assimilative genius comes 
out in " Lamia," where, adopting Drvden's style, he 
far surpasses his master in originality of design and 
wealth of detail. "The Pot of Basil" is the most 
human of his poems, and •• The Eve of St Agnes " 
the most complete exhibition of all the resooreeB of 
the poetic art. Never was the Muse more decked 
and adorned, or more irradiated with inward light 

Our book ought "to contain something bj- Crabbe 
and by Moore, in the first case to show how far 
poetry can descend into prose — herd swine like the 
Prodigal Son — without forfeiting its birthright 
and in the second case to show how it can put on 
tinsel and false gauds without losii^ its character 
for right virtue. One of Crabbe's -'Tales of the 
Hall '■ would do : and. on the principle of taking a 
man's most characteristic piece in this kind, Moore's 
" Paradise and the Peri " might be a good selection. 
It is sweetly prettj- anyhow. For various reasons, 
Blake, Campbell, Leigh Hunt, and Tom Hood haidly 
seem to yield anj-thing to our purpose. 

I should g^ve a good part of Landor's - Gebir," 
whose Laconism is a thing by itself in our literature. 
And I should include the first half of Home's 
"Orion," a poem which, though it echoes Milton 
and Keats, holds itself not unworthily on a level 
with their best, and which has. besides, a spiritual 
individuality of its own. Arnold's " Sohrab and 
Rustum " would complete this noble group of blank- 
verse poems. 

A collection such as is suggested would, bv bring- 
ing widely separated poems together, compel them 
to justify themselves. Each poet would be tried by 
a jury of his peers. The over-great reputation of 
Tennyson's narrative poetry would thus probably 
stand corrected. His sun would be shorn of some of 
its beams, ''Maud," his best effort I should say, in 
creative art is hardly narrative, and could not be ad- 
mitted. The "Morte D" Arthur," " Elaine," "Vivien." 
and •• Guinevere " would have to he the selections. 

Browning's magnificent "Childe Roknd to the 
Dark Tower Came " and the delightful '• Flight of 
the Duchess " would claim admittance. Browning's 
most characteristic form of art is the monologue. 
" The Ring and the Book " is a collection of mono- 
logues. This bastard form, wliich is neither drama 
nor narrative nor lyric, seems to me thoroughly 
tmnatural. A soliloquy in a play is bad enough, 
but it is sometimes a matter of sheer necessity to a 
dramatist, and it is always remotely possible that 



the solQoquist might talk aloud. But a soliloquy 
in plain air, with no compelling cause, seems folly's 
farthest flight in literature. 

From Mrs. Browning one could take '^Lady 
Geraldine's Courtship," " The Rhyme of the 
Duchess May," and " Bertha in the Lane." There 
is unquestionably a touch of over-wrought sentiment 
in these poems, but they are the utterances of a 
noble mind, and, what is more to the purpose, they 
are delightfully readable and rememberable. 

The question of admitting the ballad form of 
poetry might come up in Rossetti's case. The 
ballad, as I take it, is the naive relation of an 
incident with no conscious effort of art If this is 
so. Rossetti's poems are not true ballads at all, for 
they step forth in powder and plumes and war-paint 
and with all the ftaraphemalia of the artist's study. 
"Sister Helen," "Rose Mary," and "The King's 
Tragedy " would be good representations of his fine 
though somewhat elaborate poetry. William Morris 
is one of the most voluminous writers of narrative 
verse in the language. But the grey monotony of 
his poetry — its lack of saliency in phrase, picture, or 
character — keep it from preeminence. No greater 
critical mistake was ever made than the equalling 
of this builder of mistj- dreams in rhyme with the 
fresh, vivid, poignandy real Chaucer. But he 
deserves a niche in our book, and his '* Atalanta " is 
probably as good a piece as could be chosen. 

We are aU apt to be a little cautions in suggesting 
our near neighbors for apotheosis. The American 
poetry of the past should furnish its 'quota to this 
collection, — but our literature has not extended 
itself much in the line of epic or narrative verse. 
Perhaps a good part of Longfellow's - Evangeline," 
Lowell's " Vision of Sir Lannfal " — whose opening 
verses are the most exquisite movement he ever 
achieved — and Poe's "Raven" might be allowed to 
stand as our best specimens of this kind of poetry. 

The foregoing poems, with perhaps a few others 
unintentionally omitted, could probably be comprised 
in two not over-thick pocket volumes. These would 
indeed contain " infinite riches in a little room." 
And their publication ought to be a factor in the 
coming and inevitable Revival of Poetry.

A REXAKSABLE TRAXSFOHMATIOX OF A BOOK- 
TITLE was effected by the San Francisco fire — which 
wrought other transformations also. President Jordan's 
little book, "The Hiilosophy of Despair," destroyed 
(that is, the plates were destroyed i in ibe conflagra- 
tion, now rises from the fiery furnace, transfigured and 
glorified, as " The Philosophy (rf Hape^" a title which 
is thought to be " more cheerfully descriptive of the 
author's purpose." This, of course, is not the first time 
that real and apparently overwhelming disaster has 
proved itself the one thing needed to convert a fancied 
despair into a living hope. ProbaUy the publishers 
had no intention to point a moral by this change of 
names, but to the person fond of moralizing — and 
who is not? — the moral is there, nevertheless.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The jubilke numuku of "The Atlantic" con- 
tains a veiy interesting account, by Professor Charles 
Eliot Norton, of how the magazine was launched in 
the fall of 1857. An active existence of half a 
century is enough to make venerable any institu- 
tion (for surely "The Atlantic" is an institution), and 
almost any man of parts, in this country. In Mr. 
Norton's case the activity has covered considerably more 
than fifty years, while his mere continued existence as 
an individual has now added him to the honorable roll 
of octogenarians. To be precise, the present issue of 
The Dial is dated upon Mr. Norton's eightieth birth- 
day, which gives us a pretext for paying once more our 
tribute of respect to the fine intelligence which he has 
so efl'ectively brought to bear upon so many problems 
of art and conduct, and to the ethical idealism which he 
has ever sought to translate into action in our public and 
private life. Although his professional interests have 
been those of the scholar, he has never lapsed into the 
indifferentism that scholarship often assumes as its pre- 
scriptive right, and his influence has made itself felt for 
good in many a great public cause. The moral strength 
of his mherited puritanism has blossomed into sweetness 
in the genial sunlight of modern liberal thought, and his 
life stands for us as an embodiment of those qualities 
which we cherish as characteristic of Americans in the 
best sense. A man is in no way better tested than by 
the friendships he makes, and no American of our time 
better meets this test. Longfellow and Emerson and 
Lowell and Curtis on this side of the Atlantic, Kuskin 
and Carlyle and FitzGerald and Leslie Stephen on the 
other, all bestowed upon him their intimacy, and enriched 
his life with their affectionate regard. And the esteem 
in which those men held him has been shared by count- 
less others, unknown to fame, whose ideals he has helped 
to ennoble, and whose gratitude they would find it diffi- 
cult to put into words.

The land of' juveniij; delights is undoubtedly 
Fairyland. What particular nook or corner, or grove 
or glen, or hill or vale, has most attracted great men in 
their tender infancy, has been inquired into by an enter- 
prising publishing house; and as a result of the investi- 
gation we now have — after a more than sufficient course 
in "books that have helped me" — something about 
" books that have enchanted me." A volume entitled 
" Favorite Fairy Tales : The childhood choice of Repre- 
sentative Men and Women " presents sixteen selected 
stories, the favorites of twenty judges of wide repute m 
the literary world. But there is no unanimity of choice: 
the highest number of votes cast for the same tale is five; 
" Cinderella " and " Jack the Giant-Killer " received 
each that number, while even such nursery favorites 
as " Little Red Riding Hood " and " Beauty and the 
Beast" had only a single champion apiece. More 
authoritative and valuable would be — if we could 
have it — the actual childhood choice, as uttered in 
childhood instead of in retrospect, of all these illus- 
trious ladies and gentlemen, or perhaps even the 
childhood choice of the same number of bright boys and 
girls not yet illustrious. AVould the six-year-old Henry 
James, for example, have made the same choice, and in 
the same words, as the sexagenarian Henry James? 
This is what he characteristically says about " Hop-o'- 
My-Tliumb," which finds in him its single admirer 
among the twenty judges : " It is the vague memory of 



this sense of him, as some small, precious object, like 
a lost gem or a rare and beautifid insect on which one 
might inadvertently tread, or might find under the sofa 
or behind the window cushion, that leads me to think of 
' Hop-o'-My-Thumb ' a-s ray earliest and sweetest and 
most repeated cupful at the fount of fiction."

Humors and oddities of advertising are too 
novel, and often too amusing, to pass unnoticed in 
these days when advertising is cultivated iis a fine art, 
and each advertiser seems determined to outdo liis rivals 
in the invention of some extraordinary eye-attracting, 
attention-compelling, interest-awakening device in words 
or pictures or in both. Lady Betty Bulkeley, in that 
popular novel, " Lady Betty Across the Water," found 
the advertising pages not the least interesting part of 
American magazines; while more than one American 
visitor to England has discovered most amusmg reading 
in the " want " columns of British newspapers. What 
a wealth of homely detail in the following : " The 
invalid widow of an army officer would like to exchange 
a talking parrot for a second-clasii railway ticket from 
London to Glasgow." Henry Kingsley, half a century 
ago, in one of his many confidential asides to the readers 
of " Ravenshoe," professed to be able at any time to 
banish care by reading — reading anything, even adver- 
tisements. In the " help-wanted " columns of a great 
city daily there has just appeared a gem of the litera- 
ture of its kind. Let us quote: "I desire to secure 
the services of a woman — not the usual type of ' refined 
lady ' who is constantly on the hunt for a job — but a 
masterful, dignified woman of character, common-sense, 
and gootl breeding, who is qualified by temperament 
and education to take charge of my twelve-year-old 
daughter. The religioiLs convictions of applicants are 
of no concern to the advertiser, nor need applicants 
possess an academic or university degree, but their 
English must be somid — gi'ammar perfect. I would 
not care to seriously consider engaging a woman who 
combined daisies and violets on her winter bonnet, or 
one who referred to ciockery as ' porcelain,' or one whose 
elegant repose of manner is mere vacuity, or one who 
bids for sympatliy by frequently recurring, in soreness 
of spirit, to her ' past reverses which are responsible for 
present anomalous and unfortunate circumstances,' or 
one who extorts reluctant gleams of pleasure only f i-om 
melancholy pangs of grief, or one who beflours her face 
with the incessant acit de poudre, or one who in manner 
may be likened >into a hurricane." Tlius by the method 
of exclusions do we gam a more and more definite con- 
ception of the kind of woman desired; though the acil 
de poudre must remain a puzzler to mascidmity.

The ingenuity of the antiquary has just been put

plexing difficulties were encountered by those engaged 
in this search. It was commonly held that the house at 
19 Colebrook Row had once been occupied by the Lambs, 
but a rather prosaic and disenchanting bit of evidence 
was brought forward to disprove this. Certain old 
sewer-rate books were disinterred and consulted, and 
thus it was demonstrated that no person by the name 
of Lamb had paid sewer rates in Colebrook Row within 
the period in question. So at last the right house was 
found at 64 Duncan Terrace, Islington, where the tablet 
has with proper formalities been set. This recalls the 
curious way in which, just fifty years ago, Mr. W. Moy

Thomas upset the accepted tradition — accepted by 
no less an authority than Peter Cunningham in his 
« Handbook of London " — that No. 4 Brooke Street 
was the house where Thomas Chatterton lodged after 
leaving Mr. Wabnsley's in Shoreditch, and where he 
took that fatal dose of arsenic. It was a very neat piece 
of antiquarian research that corrected the error. Exam- 
ining the poor-rate books for 1772, Mr. Thomas found 
the name of Frederick Angell (^it wa-s with one Mrs. 
Angell that Chatterton lodged) as one of the rate-payers 
in Brooke Street, where the houses were unnumbered. 
The exact place of this name in the list was noted, and 
it was surmised that the collector of rates would natur- 
ally have made his calls in order, going up one side of 
the street and down the other. Then, in Holden's 
Directory of 1802, two of these Brooke Street rate- 
payers' names were found: they were still alive and 
occupying houses at that time definitely numbered. 
After this it required but a little counting on the fingers, 
with the old Ust before one, to determine the exact 
position of the Angell bouse — which turned out to be 
(with hardly the shadow of a doubt) Xo. 39 instead of 
No. i. One likes to imagine the successful hunter's 
satisfaction after thus cleverly attaining the object of 
his quest. • • . 

A British confessiox of British rNCOMPETEXCE

in speaking of the third volume of Sir George Trevel- 
yan's "American Revolution," acknowledges that "it is 
not a story which can be very pleasant reading to an 
Englishman even now, and even with all Sir George 
Trevelyan's literary skill to help it. Whatever were 
the virtues of Washington, whatever the courage and 
endurance of those who fought imder him and some of 
those who fought against hum, it remains the melancholy 
truth that the governing factor of the situation, the 
thing which lost and won America, was nobody's genius 
and nobody's heroism, but the criminal ignorance of 
English statesmen and the slow incompetence of English 
generals." Of course the time is long past for declaim- 
ing against tlie " pestilent rebellion " of the American 
colonists, and no Englishman now thinks of refus- 
ing to dignify that colonial uprising ^vith the name 
"revolution''; but a refreshing if belated candor is 
evinced in the above extract, in which, if scant credit is 
given to Washington and his compatriots, the grains of

Men as public-ubrary users are commonly held 
to be so greatly outnumbered by fiction-foolish women 
and children as to make but a pitiful showing for them- 
selves. Some interesting statistics (perhaps the first 
of the kind ever compiled and made public ) from the 
Pratt Institute Free Library of Brooklyn go far toward 
proving the general impression erroneous. The Pratt 
Library is a fair sample of the average public library, 
serving the wants of an average community. The month 
of March, one of the busiest in the library world, was 
chosen for a test. In that month 8934 persons came 
to the delivery room to draw or return books, and of 
these persons 55 per cent were found to be women and 
girls, and 45 per cent men and boys. The librarian 
adds : " As we know from observation that there are 
many more women and girls who come to get books 
for father, husband, or brother, than there are men and 
boys who come to get them for mother, wife, or sister, 
we conclude that there is verj- little difference in the 



I 



masculine and feminine use of the library, as far as 
numbers go. It is certain that as a rule the men read 
less fiction, and it is interesting to note that everj- 
Saturday in March showed a decided preponderance of 
men users of the circulating department." The various 
reading rooms of the reference department were found 
to be frequented by men and boys in a great majority 
over women and girls, or seventy-three per cent. It 
is pleasing to meet this evidence that man, the bread- 
winner and the busy member of the family, is neverthe- 
less a library-goer, even if he has largely ceased to be 
a chia^h-goer L'nlike the husband who took shelter 
behind his wife, who had " got religion " for the two, 
the paterfamilias of to-day need not point to his better 
half as monopolizing the culture of the partnership. For 
helping to redeem the human mind from error on this 
disputed question, we thank the Pratt Institute librarian. 

The horse ik dramatic utxratcrk has never 
played a more conspicuous part than in the new play of 
" Black Beauty," a dramatization by Mr. Justin Adams 
of ^liss Anna Sewall's famous story of the same name. 
Not even the bloodhounds in " Uncle Tom's Cabin " 
make such an appeal to gallery, balcony, orchestra, and 
dress circle (and boxes too) as does the splendid, 
carefully-trained animal that pranced onto the stage at 
•Salem, Mass., and showed himself letter-perfect in his 
heart-moving role. From his first entrance as a sleek, 
well-groomed, beautifully-caparisoned riding-horse, to 
the pitiful scene where he is beheld vainly tugging at a 
monstrous load up a terrible hill in a blinding snow- 
storm. Black Beauty commands the breathless attention, 
and sometimes the tear-moistened handkerchiefs, of his 
audience — or, better, spectators. He is well supported 
by Ginger and Merrylegs, his two equine companions, 
and by Jerry Parker's dogs. An automobile also figures 
(ingloriously) in the play. Preparations for this pro- 
duction have long been in progress, and, as mi^t have 
been expected, Mr. George T. Angell has shown the 
keenest interest in its success. In fact, it appears to 
Iiave been his offer of a thousand dollars for the best 
dramatization of the story that led to the interesting 
event at Salem. ^liss Flavia Rosser's version, with the 
scene laid in England, took the pnze, and will probably be 
staged before long. The play has elements of popularity, 
as well as other points of excellence, and is likely to have 
a successful run. ... 

The unprofxssioxax reader, like the unprofes- 
sional critic, is sometimes visited with flashes of insight 
denied to members of the g^d. A good story is told 
about the rejection and the subsequent acceptance of 
" Joseph Vance," the predecessor of " Alice-for-Short." 
Having finished the story two years after the first sug- 
gestion of it had occurred to him, Mr. De Morgan sent 
the manuscript to a publisher, who promptly returned it 
with the comment that the tale was too long. Two 
bimdred thousand words, written by hand, do make a 
formidably bidky appearance, and therefore the author 
decided to see whether a type-written copy might not 
fare better. He sent the mannscript to a type-writing 
establishment, whose head, a woman of intelligence, 
noticed a little later, in the course of her rounds, that 
one of her g^rl typists was in tears. Inquiry revealed 
the fact that this display of grief bad been caused by an 
incideut in " Joseph Vance," which the girl was copying. 
A friend of the intelligent woman, an art publisher, 
heard of the incident from her, asked to see the manu- 
script, read it with zest, and carried it to another 
publisher, with the result now known to the world.

THE AMERICAN MARKET FOR 
FRENCH BOOKS. 



Paris, November 4, 1907. 

What is the matter with the market for French books 
in the United States ? This is the interesting question 
that has lately been xuider discussion in the columns of 
several of the important journals of Paris. That inde- 
fatigable gentleman, M. Hugues Le Roux, has been 
investigating the case, and he has called in consultation 
a number of the literary doctors most in repute at 
the moment, such as Messieurs Paul Hervieu, Marcel 
Provost, Jules Claretie, Henri Houssaye, and Abel 
Hemiant. All are agreed that the reputation of the 
French book among us is in a very bad way, and that 
something ought to be done at once. We may well be 
interested in their efforts. For if the United States 
should cease altogether to be importers of French books, 
it would not be the French authors and publishers who 
would be the only losers. We should be immeasurably 
poorer without the part that France can contribute to our 
intellectual life. 

It would appear, from the diagnosis of M. Le Roux, 
that the trouble may be traced to a variety of causes. 
In the first place, in the words of one of the journals 
referred to, there is a united effort on the part of com- 
peting nations to stifle the propagation of the French 
language and French thought in the United States. 
These competitors, among whom the Germans occupy 
naturally a foremost place, liave foimd most efficient 
allies in the teachers of French in om- schools, colleges, 
and universities, of whose incompetence M. Le Roux 
draws a terrifying pictui-e. The teachmg of French in 
the United States, it seems, is almost whoUy in the hands 
of Germans, Swiss, Belgians, and Americans, equally 
unable, for different reasons, to interpret French thought 
and initiate our youth into the real secrets of the French 
language. As M. Le Roux visited not a few of our 
schools and universities as the official lecturer of the 
Alliance Frangaise, it is to be supposed that this sweep- 
ing condemnation is based upon personal observation, 
and I suppose it would be out of place on the part of 
one of these same incompetent Americans to protest. 
And in support of this opinion, M. Maxime Ingres, who, 
I presume, is not yet forgotten in Chicago, has sketched, 
in the Matin, what he avers to be the exact and lifelike 
portrait of the professor of French in our country, but 
what appears to one of the incompetents to be a most 
grotesque caricature. To say the least, M. Ingres has 
not been scrupulously exact in his statements of fact. 

But all these enemies, active and passive, wilful and 
unconscious, of the French book among us would not 
have brought it to the sorry pass in which it now is were 
it not for an tmclean sore that it bears within itself. For 
it is ag^-eed among our doctors that if the good name of 
French literature is in a decline, and consequently the 
demand for French books has fallen off, a principal 
reason is to be found in the charge of lubricity and 
indecency to which they are so often open. La Utterature 
pomographique is largely responsible for the situation. 
Authors and publishers, catering to the debauched taste 
of the sensuiil reader, have so swollen the mass of this 
ill-smelling literature that it is begmuing to be taken to 
represent French letters, to their serious hurt. The 
hasty and unwarranted conclusion has been drawn that 
all French books are alike, and no better than the worst ; 
and as a result the great American public, whose modesty 
is so sensitive, almost irritable, will have none — or very 
few — of them. 



If this diagnosis is correct (and few will think that 
it is wholly wrong), the remedy proposed hardly seems 
likely to result in a complete cure. What is suggested, 
beyond the more effective organization of publishers to 
push their interests over-sea, is nothing more than a 
kind of inspection to which literature for export, at 
least to the United States, is to be subjected. No work 
shall be allowed to pass that cannot be branded as sound 
and wholesome. 

To say nothing of the discrimination which such 
action contemplates against the home market, it may 
be doubtful whether it can possibly accomplish its 
purpose. Inspection may have saved the foreign 
market for American meat. But a book is a very 
different thing from a piece of meat. If a book is 
stamped as unclean, it is not at all sure that it is thereby 
irrevocably consigned to the soap-vat. If there were a 
lively demand for tainted meat for food, it is pretty 
sure that some would find its way to the eager purchaser. 
Of course the Utterature pomographiqiie is not published 
from miselfish motives, nor thrust by missionaries into 
the hands of unwilling readers. In producing books of 
this kind, authors and pubhshers are reckoning on a 
public demand. If they find them profitable, how are 
they to be convinced that it would be still more profit- 
able not to publish them, or not to allow them to reach 
a certain region of territory or a certain circle of readers ? 
And how could they prevent them from reaching that 
circle of readers if they were so convinced ? 

And then comes the question. What are the boun- 
daries of this literature, and how is it to be defined ? 
Are the tales of Maupassant to be included within it ? 
Is Zola a pornographic author ? Are all the doctors 
whom M. Le Roux lias called in consultation, — M. 
Marcel Provost, for example, — in position to cast the 
first stone at some unexportable brother ? I strongly 
suspect that, while their diagnosis contains much truth, 
it does not contain all the truth, and that the American 
distrust of the French book is based partly upon a deep 
difference, national aud racial, of habit and feeling with 
regard to certain matters — that difference that made 
so intelligent and liberal a critic as Matthew Arnold, 
with all his recognition of tlie eminent and superior 
qualities of the French mind and its achievements, lodge 
against that people the charge of worshipping at the 
shrine of the Goddess Lubricity. Tlie agitation of the 
question, a propos of the commercial interest which the 
American market offers, is worth noting rather as a 
symptom of awakening consciousness in this direction 
tha:i as promising any great direct or immediate result. 
We may regret that it seems rather a sordid motive 
that prompted this consciousness to express itself; but 
as a symptom it is none the less most welcome, and 
infinitely more important than any practical measures 
that it may provoke. Arthur G. Canfield.

GENERAL HOWARD AND LINCOLN UNIVERSITY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I have just read, with much satisfaction, the interesting 
and appreciative review of ray brother's autobiography, 
in your issue for October 16. The notice, all in all, is 
so satisfactory to General Howard's many friends that 
I the more readily ask your attention to one or two very 
natural errors, which you may deem it worth while to 
correct in another issue of The Dial.

In the first paragraph, Lincoln Memorial University, 
of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, is classed as one of the 
schools for " colored youth." It has nerer had a colcwed 
stodent, and was not designed for such, but for the 
American Mountaineers — from which racial stock 
Abraham Lincoln is supposed to have had his origin. 
President Lincoln himself personally directed General 
Howard's attention to the loyalty of these mountaineers, 
andtfaoogfa in the Reconstruction period Geueral Howard 
fonnded a number of schools for colored youth, like 
Howard L'niversity in Washington, D. C, this University 
at Cumberland Gap was designed exclusively for whites, 
and for the past fifteen years or more General Howard 
has devoted almost his entire time and energies to the 
laying of its foundations and building it up, not only by 
ample endowment, but also in the confidence and affec- 
tion of the mountain people. 

One other point, which might seem to yon as merely 
technical, is the reference to General Howard's military 
career as reaching <mly to the command of an Army 
Corps. As a matter of fact, he became the Commander 
of the Army of the Tennessee, the same army with 
which Grant captured Vicksburg, and which Sherman 
commanded in one or two campaigns and at the battle 
of Chattanooga. It consisted of three fidl Army Corps 
and other detached bodies, amoimting to over a hundred 
thousand men. The tliree Corps were the 15th (Logan's), 
16tli ( Dodge's), and the 17th (Blair s). As General 
Howard is the only remaining Army Commander of the 
Civil War, it seems worth while to keep this fact in 
view in considering the value and merit of these two 
volumes of autobiography. q j£ Howakd.

THE rescit: of a poem in distress. 

(To the Editor of Thk Dial.) 

Do you ever listen to an author's tale of woe — even 
a poet's ? May I tell you the sad story of the sacrifice 
of a poem — two poems, indeed — not to the eccen- 
tricity of printer or proof-reader (that would be too 
common^, bot to an editor's curious mismating of titles, a 
mockingly perverse juxtaposition? Poems are sensitive 
products; as a wind makes sport of a rose, so — bat I 
will proceed. 

Four or five years ago one of the minor magazines 
offered a number of prizes, one being a prize of two 
hundred dollars, for the best poem less than thirty-six 
lines in leng^. Inspired by a gambler's hope of wealth, 
I sent the editor four or five pieces, concealing my name 
in a sealed envelope, according to the rules of the game. 
In two or three mouths came an envelope from the 
editor's sanctum. Conld I be the lucky winner? But 
my hope of riches subsided when I read the contents : the 
editor asked me to divide the prize with no less than 
nine other poets! 

I will not comment upon the point of editorial honor 
involved in this method of securing large returns of 
poetry for a very small outlay of dollars. My grievance 
vented itself in laughter; I let the editor have the poem, 
and also three others for which he nobly offered sixpence 
apiece. In a few months the first was published, and a 
second soon after. 

Of the two which lingered in the editor's desk, one, 
which I called " The Question,'' had been written in the 
lightest spirit of badinage for a " 1 Jttle Room " valen- 
tine party. It began: 

What U love '. Lore u a fire. 
But tears can't quench it, — 



' and continued with nnmeroos fnTidons answers to the 

I query in the first line. 

The other piece had been written somewhat earlier, 

' and in a very different mood. Its subject was rather 
ambitious: human personality, the ego, especially the 
feminine ego, the summing-up of all life in the individual 
soul. Titles are very boresome, and I had never found 
a good one for tlus poem. " The Answer," " The 
Question," "Myself" were some rather inadequate 
experiments, and I scarcely knew under which of them 
it had gone to the magazine. 

Judge, then, of my horror when, in a recent issue of 
the same magazine, I found the two poems printed 
together! The valentine poem became " The Question," 
the other "The Answer," and both, by the unhappy 
association, were stabbed, killed, reduced to ashes. 

My heart went out to the hapless reader who should 
obediently take the two pieces together and try to make 
the second answer the light question of the first. Whether 
he would read them both as serious, or both as a joke, 
my jumbled In^in scarcely dared inqiure. Twice in 
vain I had written the editor for proofs, and thus he and 
fate flouted me. Not only that, but here, in the serious 
poem, was a pivotal word deliberately changed to a weak 
one without so much as a " by-your-leave." 

Had I no right to feel aggrieved? And now, being 
an editor yourself and therefore solicitous for the honor 
of your clan, will you rescue a poem in distress? Will 
vou nntangle my verses on human personahty — on the 
ego, myself (you may find a title if you can) — from the 
evil meshes in which they were smothered, and let them 

I stand free at last upon your page? 
Here are the verses: 

What am I ? I am Earth the mother.

West Point Half a Centtjky Ago.* 

The pages of General Schaff's " Spirit of Old 
West Point " breathe at once the poetiy and ro- 
mance of warfare, as the poet and the romancer 
are fond of conceiving it, and also the grim hor- 
ror and sad pity of it all, as seen and felt by the 
soldier on the battlefield. This curious mingling 
of seeming incompatibles, symbolic of the self- 
contradictory element in life itself, shows the 
author to be a poet as well as a warrior, a man 
of imagination as well as a man of action. His 
love of poetic imagery, his tendency to infuse 
with life and feeling the inanimate objects about 
him, his fondness for drawing spiritual truths 
from material facts, give to his narrative a higher 
beauty and a deeper meaning than we are wont 
to find in a soldier's reminiscences. 

Graduated from West Point in 1862, the au- 
thor was sent at once to the field, where he served 
under Meade, Hooker, and Grant. Thus it is 
that his memories of the Military Academy, and 
of his instructors and fellow-students, are con- 
tinually calling up other memories of campaigns 
and battlefields where some of those teachers and 
classmates played more or less important parts. 
This repeated jumping from the bank of the 
Hudson to that of the Potomac, from the cadet 
chapel to the Wilderness, from the recitation 
room to the field of Gettysburg, makes rather 
jolty reading, but gives variety and life to his 
chapters, and affords frequent opportunity for 
pen-jjainting and for outbursts of patriotic elo- 
quence. A reverent and at times a devout tone 
sounds through the book and shows this soldier 
to have been equipped for spiritual no less than 
for carnal conflict. He was, while at the Acad- 
emy, a member of "Howard's little prayer- 
meeting," which never numbered more than ten 
or fifteen souls, and which General Howard has 
himself described in his own memories of West 
Point. The almost simultaneous appearance of 
the older and the younger West Pointers' books 
adds interest to the following passage from the 
junior's pen : 

" My other instructor m pure mathematics was Major- 
Greneral O. O Howard, probably known more widely 
among the church-going people of our country than any 
officer of his time. His head is now almost snowy white, 
and his armless sleeve tells its story; yet when I saw him 
last there was the same mild, deeply sincere, country- 
bred simplicity in his face that it wore when, so many 
years ago, I sat on the bench or stood before him in the 

•The Spirit op Old West Point. 1858-1862. By Morris 
Schaff. Illustrated. Boston : Houghton. Mifflin & Co. 



section room. His voice too had barely changed at all; 
it was still pitched in the same mellow, clerical !• ey, and 
accompanied, when humorous in its vein, with the same 
boyish smile in his earnest blue eyes, — eyes always 
filled with that light of another and a hoher land, the 
fair land of the Clu-istian's gaze." 

As there are few now living who have seen 
and can distinctly remember General Winfield 
Scott, it may be worth while to take a look at 
him tlirough the younger soldier's eyes. The 
old warrior was, at the time now recalled, in 
command of the army, with his headquarters at 
West Point. 

" The old General made himself heard, considered, 
and felt throughout the comitry. He was over six feet 
six inches tall, and in frame was simply colossal. It so 
happened that only the rail separated his pew in the 
chapel from the one which I occupied, — it was four or 
five pews back, on the right side facing the chancel, — 
and I felt like a pigmy when I stood beside him. The 
old fellow was devout; but it was said that whatsoever 
church he attended. Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist, or 
Roman Catholic he threw himself into the service with 
the same depth of reverence. Nevertheless he would 
sometimes swear like a pirate. Surely, I think nature 
must have been in one of her royal moods at his birth, 
for there was magnificence in the dignity of his great, 
kingly, illuminated countenance. . . . We were all proud 
of the old hero, and more than ever when, in the blaze 
of full uniform and with uncovered head, he stood at the 
left of the present King of England at the review given 
for him at West Point in 1860." 

General Schaff's estimate of West Point as 
a character-builder and a maker of men finds 
repeated expression in his book. To him his 
alma mater is indeed a gracious mother of noble 
sons, and his ideal of a liberal education is a 
four-years coui-se under her fostering care. He 
dwells fondly on the Acatlemy's honored past, 
on its historic antecedents which have made it 
what it now is. At the same time the man of 
letters speaks in him when he ventures to criti- 
cize what he thinks an excessive devotion to 
science in the curriculum, and urges the counter- 
claims of history and literature. However, he 
continues in panegyric strain : 

" But weigh the course as you may, — and certainly 
her graduates have worthily met the mighty problems 
of war, — this must be said: West Point is a great char- 
acter-builder, perhaps the greatest among our institu- 
tions of learning. The habit of truth-telling, the virtue 
of absolute honesty, the ready and loyal obedience to 
authority, the display of courage, — that virtue called 
regal, — to establish these elements of character, she 
labors without ceasing. Tlie primary agency in accom- 
plishing her ends is, and has been, the tone of the 
cadets. This tone, the very life and breath of the Military 
Academy, tracks back to a fine source, to the character 
of Washington and the best society at the time of the 
Revolution, for, since the day when he had his head- 
quarters at West Point, it has been exclusively a mili- 
tary post, completely isolated from the social ferment 
and adventitious standards of commerce and trade. His

standards of private and official life, and those of the 
officers and the gentlemen of his day, were the standards 
of his Lmmediate successors, who, in turn, transmitted 
them unimpaired to those who came after. Moreover, 
at his suggestion, West Point as an institution of learn- 
ing came into being; and its foundations were laid on 
the solid virtues of his example." 

The author's course at West Point, falling 
in the exciting times immediately prece<ling and 
foUow-inji the outbreak of our Ci^^l War. was 
no sleepy Sunday-.school session. The partisan 
strife within the Academy walls may have been 
something like a tempest in a teapot, but from 
the very fact that the lid of the teapot was so 
firmly held down by the authorities the occa- 
sional outbursts of steam were violent. Southern 
blood was hot, and Yankee principle was unbend- 
ing, so that the wonder of it all is, as the author 
says, that any West Point men from the South 
remained loyal to the flag. Yet loyal they did 
remain, to the number of more than half the 
Southern graduates. But there is no occasion 
here to stir the smouldering embers. Let us 
ttu-n to a significant passage in wliich the soldier- 
author deplores what seems to him a present 
tendency to subordinate scholarly to military 
interests at his old school. 

" It is far from my intention to say that a complete 
change has taken place, that the Academic Board has 
changed places with the Military Staff in the active and 
formative influences of West Point .life. But I cannot 
resist the conclusion that, if militarism grows more 
ascendant, serious changes must take place iu the ideals 
of West Point; for ideals feed on culture, they lie down 
in the green pastures of knowledge, their shrines are not 
in dnuns but iu the aspirations of the heart. Militarism 
once fully entrenched tolerates no challenge of preced- 
ence and cidture; scholarship, idealism, those great 
liberating forces, must grow less and less influential as 
less and less they are appreciated and reverenced. 
Nothing, it seems to me, could be worse for West Point 
or worse for the army as a profession than to have the 
Academic Board sink to the level of mere teachers; in 
other words, to see West Point fall from the level of a 
nniversity to that of a jiost school at a garrison ..." 

Among the post-gi-aduate reminiscences so 
generously interspersetl, nothing is better than 
this picture of General Grant : 

" Let me say in this connection that of all the officers 
of high rank whom I have ever met, onlj- Grant and 
Sherman did not charge the atmosphere about them with 
military consequence. While at City Point I frequently 
joined my friends of General Grant's staff ... at his 
headquarters. The Geuei-al, in undress unifonn, always 
neat but not fastidious in appointments, would sit at the 
door of his tent, or sometimes on one of the long settees 
that faced each other imder the tent-fly, smoke, listen, 
and sometimes talk; and not a soul of us, from the 
youngest to the oldest, ever had a thought of rank. 
Without lowering liis manner to the level of familiarity, 
he put every one at his ease by his natural simplicity. 
He had none of the caprices of moods or vanity. Quiet 



in his presence and natural in his manner, gentle in voice, 
of absolute purity in speech, of imatf ected, simple dignity. 
Grant threw a charm around his camp-fire. West Point 
never graduated a man who added so little austerity or 
pretense to the peak of fame." 

The foretaste that " Atlantic " readers have 
hatl of these very readable chapters ought to 
give additional relish to the completed book, 
which contains much additional matter, as well 
as nmnerous and excellent views of West Point 
buildings and scenes, past and present. One 
looks in vain for the author's portrait among the 
plates ; but regret at not finding it would prob- 
ably have given place to a greater regret had 
General SchafF overcome his modestj' and put 
in his picture. So hard is human nature to 
please. The only misprint noticeable to us in 
this handsome volume is in General James H. 
Wilson's name, which appears in the index as 
"James H. Willson "' and on page 169 as 
" James M. Wilson." Pekct F. Bicknell. 



All About Everythln-g ix Homer.* 

From various volumes on Homeric subjects 
the rather rebellious re^aewer happened to turn 
to Mr. A. D. Godley's unique " Verses to Order," 
and a kindly Athena guided his eye to this 

delight : 

'• POLUPHLOISBOISTEROUS Homer of old 
Threw all his augments into the sea, 
Althoug^h he bad often been courteously told 

That perfect imperfects begin with an e : 
But the Poet replied, with a dignified air, 
' What the Digarama does anyone care ? ' " 

And in all seriousness what does anyone care 
about nine-t«ntLs or more of the flood of Homeric 
controversy and commentary? For instance, 
may we beg the courteous reader to turn his 
twin-eyed gaze ujwn the following tabulation 
from a German scholar, and the generalizing 
comment ? 

Homeric Modem 

Warfare. M'arjare. 

Womids on the Head, 21 per cent 7 per cent. 

Wounds on the Neck, 11 per cent. 2 per cent. 

Wounds on the Body, 64 per cent 21 per cent 

Wounds on the Lower Limbs, 7 per cent. 6 per cent 

Wounds on the Upper Limbs, 7 per cent 44 per cent 

" From this table it is seen that the Homeric 
warrior aimed with the spear at the head and 
neck, while the modern bullet is directed from 
a greater distance at the whole body." Perhaps 
the joyous German insistence on these details 
was innately military ; perhaps it was CA'en 
proudly national, intended to offset the enthusi- 
astic Frenchman who suggested that the author

of the Iliad was aide-de-camp or military sec- 
retary to Agamemnon. Be that as it may, let 
us try to imagine the thrill of enlarged horizons 
conveyed by the above to a reader who has been 
following Achilles in his death-dealing rage, or 
standing by Menelaus when the tiiice-ending 
arrow of Pandarus had brought him nigh to 
death, and blood was staining his shapely thighs, 
" even as when a woman, Mieonian or Carian, 
stains ivory with pui-ple, to be a cheek-piece 
for horses." And, lest Philology should be 
preeminent in pedantic motley, her sister 
Archajology occasionally assumes the jingling 
bells and sings that " one square half-inch of 
ancient potsherd is worth a hundred written 
tomes." Fortunate was the boy who "began his 
Homer with few notes and no problems. His 
was the joy, in some measure, of the old Greek 
audience that hung on the winged words as they 
came from the lips of Ion or some other rhap- 
sodist ; for even yet the divine magnetism of 
which Plato tells may stream tlirough the series 
of rmgs from poet to reader, and work compel- 
lingly upon the mind of man. Howbeit, the 
two sisters in their ordinary mood of loving and 
laborious ministry have achieved notable results 
and have deserved thorougldy well of the one 
demi-god or the thousand men who moulded the 
Homeric poems. They have brought us to a 
delectable inn, where, as we enjoy our poet, we 
may order almost any favorite theory and have 
it served by at least one eminent scholar while 
our stupid opponent is being equally well served 
at the neighbormg table. If the descendants 
of WoK still seek to tear the poems asunder, 
Mr. Andrew Lang sturdily defends their essen- 
tial unity ; if a few still cling to the " ballad " 
theory, M. Breal pins his faith to a real epopee 
emanating from a formal or even courtly civil- 
ization. Moreover, while the sisters leave us 
this pleasant luxm-y of wavering about numerous 
questions, they have in many cases enabled us 
to exchange an old problem for a new one, and 
not a few of the difficidties they have actually 
settled. 

Some time in the course of the second mil- 
lennium B.C., — say from the seventeenth to 
fourteenth centuries, — an opident civilization 
of a decidedly oriental tinge spread over the 
sprinkled isles of the ^gean and some of the 
neighboring shores. At various centres were 
dynasts of great wealth, having at their com- 
mand skilful artificers in many crafts, par- 
ticidarly cunning workers in metal, whose 
products still delight our eyes and command 
Our admiration. Then came a change, not as 



cataclysmic as we were asked to believe, but 
still a material change ; and the golden glories 
gave way to an age that was yet wealthy and 
comfoi-table, although its life was simpler and 
its crafts more humble. During this period 
the Homei'ic poems were either evolved or 
created, the work of countless minor bards, or 
of several great poets, or primarily of one 
supreme master. Personally the present writer 
has always been inclined to believe roughly in 
the essential unity of final authorship. This 
does not preclude either the free utilization of 
rich material by the fashioning author, or minor 
accretions from later hands. At any rate, the 
Iliatl and Odyssey came into being in the course 
of this second era. From an exact date one 
still shrinks, although M. Breal is willing to 
assign " the works passing under the name of 
Homer " to the era of the last Lydian kings. 
Between eleven hundred and eight hundred B. c. 
would seem as close an approximation as would 
be safe at present. The poems certamly con- 
tain traces of the earlier " golden " civilization, 
and we need not be regarded as very teri'ible 
stratifiers if we cannot limit the picture to quite 
as short and definite a period as does Mr. Lang. 

We have spoken of the poems as things writ- 
ten ; and it is pleasant to reflect that one more 
bogy of our childhood days has been laid to rest : 
" necessary oral transmission " has disappeared 
before evidences of writing long antecedent to 
the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey. Fur- 
thermore, they were written in a conventional 
dialect that does not belong to any one of the 
recognized ethnical or linguistic divisions of the 
early Greeks, such as ^olic or Ionic. To this 
an interesting parallel has been found in the 
Ti-oubatlour use of Limousin, wherein are 
mingled many Provencal, Italian, and other 
forms. Such a settled dialect and the elabo- 
rate hexametrical verse point to a long line of 
sinjrers as well as to an audience with a trained 
taste. Indeed, there is much to support the 
contention that the poetry is primarily court 
poetry, if we use the term with due reserve 
as to the connotation. For of times the court 
must have been very simple ; and the connec- 
tion between princes and retainers was so close 
that for the most part they doubtless heard the 
songs together. And the singers sang of count- 
less things, alike of those that had been, and 
those that were, and those that coidd never be. 

To help us understand the song, many men 
have written many books, the latest being from 
the hand of the honored Ilillhouse Professor 
of Greek m Yale University. " The author's

point of view has been philological, not archseo- 
logical. From the poet's language he has 
attempted to discover what was before the 
poet's mind." Arch«ological studies are warmly 
recommended in conjunction with the author s 
work; but his own book "seeks to set forth 
with regard to Homeric antiquities simply what 
may be learned from the Homeric poems them- 
selves, with such illustration as is obvious or 
naturally presented from other sources." The 
outcome is a vohmie of the Eealien type so 
common in Grermany. Thus, one chapter 
treats of " Trade antl the Crafts," another of 
" Animals, Fishes, Birds, and Insects." another 
of "Homeric War," and so on. Then imder 
each subdivision, — e. g., " Fortification of the 
Homeric Age " or '• Beha%-iour with different 
Wotmds," — all the pertinent passages are care- 
fuUv collected and briefly commented upon. 
Not infrequently there is an archalogical refer- 
ence or a helpful parallel from the Old Testa- 
ment. In accordance with the general plan, 
everything in the poems, from olives to Olympus, 
is pigeon-holed and made immediately available. 

One of the most attractive chapters Ijears the 
caption •• The Troad." Every man has visual- 
ized a Troad of his own ; and some are in a 
position to share the enthusiasm of Professor 
Seymour's traveller. 

" I took advantage of a little leisure to read the Iliad 
over again in the presence of the great natural features 
of the scene. Xo one who has not seen the magnificent 
outline which bounds the horizon of the plain of Troy 
can bring home to his mind the stirring and marvellous 
narrative of the poet as Homer meant it to affect his 
readers, or rather hearers." 

We too remember some days of dream in the 
Dardanelles or on the Troad. Agamemnon 
Schliemann was our cabin-mate, and the expe- 
dition was under the leadership of Professor 
William Dorpfeld, as brilliant as he is thorough. 
But after all, as we look back, we are not sure 
that the elusive genius loci was not caught as 
well in the ill-equipped schoolroom of our boy- 
hood days as it was in the material Troad, vis- 
ited even under such glorious conditions. And 
we are gratefid to the Yale classicist for pointing 
out that Homer was not a topographer. As a 
matter of fact the writer of the Iliad needed 
no more knowledge of the plain of Troy than 
could be attainetl by a man who had learned his 
geography from others — pirates, travellers, or 
what not. We know now that Hissarlik is the 
site of Troy : that the coast-line is not materially 
changed ; that the Mendere is the Scamander, 
and that the Dumbrek is the Simois. It will 



also be recalled that on the site of the city Pro- 
fessor Dorpfeld found nine strata, representing 
nine successive settlements, and that he places 
Troy in the sixth layer from the bottom. As one 
listens to the eminent German's own arguments, 
glowingly delivered amid the pathetic ruins, one 
is almost enthusiastically sure of his eorreetness 
even in details ; but cold reason would indicate 
that some modifications of his views are quite 
possible if there shall be any serious excavation 
by other hands, — an unlikely contingency for 
the present generation. Touching some minor 
points on the plain, the views may well be as 
shifting as the betl of the Scamander itself, with- 
out marring either our enjoj-ment or our essential 
imderstanding. Professor Seymour's chapter 
offers an accessible and reliable summary of the 
most recent conclusions, and his readers should 
feel comparatively at home in the passages in- 
volving a conception of these storied scenes. 

The chapter on the Troad is separated from 
its important kinsman dealing with " Cosmo- 
graphy and Geography." Here the main fea- 
ture of current interest is the controversy as to 
whether the Ithaca of the poems is the modem 
Ithaca, or Lenkas. Our author pronounces no 
decision, but seems inclined to favor Professor 
Dorpfeld's choic-e of the latter island. In a 
later chapter, however (p. 94), he speaks of the 
island of Ithaca as though it had been definitely 
identified. In recent Homeric geographical dis- 
cussion the most startling thing is " M. Beraxd's 
sumptuous book intended to prove that the 
Odyssey was only a Greek paraphrase of the 
'Sailing Directions of Phoenician mariners.'" 
This work is promptly and deliberately shelved 
by Professor Se_\Tnour, and few will question 
the soimdness of his tenet that " we need not be 
more definite than Homer." But we may be 
allowed to mention, in passing, that parts of 
I M. Berard's adventurous essay are uncommonly 
readable. It is so pleasant to bave every possible 
or impossible Homeric place identified beyond 
: controversy ; and this the zealous Frenchman 
does for us with truly national charm. 

ilany other captions invite comment, partio- 
idarly " The Homeric State "; but we must 
limit ourselves to a brief note on "Women 
and the Family." This chapter b^ins with a 
depiction of eight women selected as Homeric 
types. Here too our author follows the same 
I conscientious method of quotation and comment 
' that he does elsewhere. Although this involves 
rather uncomfortable limitations, inasmuch as 
it is a little hard to conceive of Helen and 
Andromache as Realien, it certainly precludes

efPusIveness. And if Professor Seymour does 
no undue glorifying, neither does he sin with 
Lemaitre in his Contes, and a few serious 
critics, by spoiling the white picture of the girl 
Nausicaa, and troubling with little Parisian peb- 
bles of doubt the still sweet depths of Penelope's 
faithfiU heart. To the topics taken up later 
in the chapter, the liealien method is better 
adapted ; and we have a clear treatment of such 
questions as the heading of the chapter would 
readily suggest. 

Of the foregoing, as of all other sections of 
" Life in the Homeric Age," it may be said that 
they represent painstaking erudition. Professor 
Seymour has spent a large part of a studious life 
in preparing himself for the wi-iting of such a 
book ; and it is probably a rash reviewer who 
would assail him, save in the numerous details 
that are always debatable in such a connection. 
And yet, in all respectfid honesty we must point 
out some not unimportant grounds for unfavor- 
able criticism. The most serious disappointment 
is due in part to the fact that the title, " Life 
in the Homeric age," suggests a volume teeming 
with movement and inspiration; whereas the 
very method of treatment precludes the realiza- 
tion of any such conception. In the second 
place, the work seems too detailed for a yoimger 
student, while for an advanced worker it ought 
to embody more residts from Archaeology and 
the increasingly important science of Anthro- 
pology. Again, one is compelled to notice a 
regrettable lack of proportion, a habit of repeti- 
tion that might be called otiose if one did not 
know the over-conscientious author, and a con- 
stant reciu-rence of a negative method of eluci- 
dation. Of this last tendency one could quote 
scores of instances. Thus : " The Achaeans had 
no written documents ; and no mortgages to 
foreclose." " Nothing indicates the existence 
of detailed rules for the bringing up of chil- 
dren." The next two sentences show in addi- 
tion a modernity that the re^aewer feels to be 
thoroughly infelicitous : " The success or failure 
of the fight does not rest Nvith him [the private 
soldier] : he is not ' the man behind the gun.' " 
" This is ' team work ' rather than ' individual 
play'; but it is not a Macedonian phalanx." 
The explanation of the painfid frequency of 
these examples is doubtless to be sought in the 
prior employment of much of the material in 
the class-room, where every device to arouse 
and maintain interest may be not only legitimate 
but laudable. In an ambitious and dignified 
work, however, they are surely out of place. 
Minor questions of style we pass in silence save 



one. The laundrying expedition of Nausicaa is 
mentioned ten or twelve times, and she almost 
invariably " laves the linen." when one would 
so much prefer to have her wash it. But there is 
a larger question involved ; for if we are dealing 
with a very late epopee and a very artificial 
court life, we should liave to regard Nausicaa 's 
fateful expedition as the caprice of an archaiz- 
ing princess who would certainly " lave the 
linen." Flowever, it is probable that even M. 
Breal woidd not carry the point to such a logi- 
cal conclusion, and Professor Seymour is doubt- 
less repeating a phrase, not advocating a theory. 
And it may well be that we should have left this 
for the classical journals, to which we must 
suiTcnder so many opportunities to air our 
presumptuous differences of opinion on technical 
points. 

Despite all our efforts, the patient reatler will 
have noticed our skepticism as to the final value 
of many books of the Realien type ; but if we 
are to have them, they should adhere stiictly to 
their plan and not exhibit an imnatural admix- 
ture of aesthetic criticism. If one is occasion- 
ally tempted to believe that there is nothing less 
real than liealien, one is often sleepily forced 
to conclude that there may be nothing more 
anaesthetic than aesthetics. In this respect 
Professor Seymour is above reproach. 

The seven hundred pages are well and cor- 
rectly printed, and the binding is exceptionally 
appropriate and attractive. The illustrations on 
the whole ai-e helpfid and well-chosen, although 
one queries the appositeness of the Apollo 
Belvedere (facing p. 176). There is an English 
index as weU as a Greek one. To the service- 
able Bibliography even the general reader should 
now add Mr. Andrew Lang's " Homer and his 
Age " and M. Breal's " Pour mieux connaitre 
Homere," which are mentioned in the preface 
as appearing after most of " Life in the Homeric 
Age " was in type. Both of these books are stim- 
ulating and enjoyable. On the purely archaeo- 
logical side, we should probably recall " The 
Discoveries in Crete " by Professor Ronald 
Burrows, who discusses the points of contact 
between the recent excavations and the problems 
of the Homeric poems. p g jj Hellems.

the twelfth to the fourteenth century. The translator

The Exglish Xovel axd the Rascally 
Axti-Hebo.* 



Eight years ago the Macmillan Company 
published a book by Professor Frank Wadleigh 
Chandler entitled " The Picaresque Novel in 
Spain." further described on the title-page as 
Part I. of •• Eomances of Roguery." It was one 
of the Columbia University •• Studies in Liter- 
ature," the result of a detailed research into 
the character and development of the Spanish 
picaro. With hxunor and appreciation un- 
usual in combination with so much erudition, it 
showed forth the picaresque rascal, deliciously 
light-handed, hard-hearted, and glib-tongued, 
but quite lacking in subtlety of motive — so mer- 
cenary indeed as fully to warrant Professor 
Chandler's epithet for him of '• anti-heroic." 
It was by virtue of the light that this primitive 
anti-hero throws upon the hero — and the anti- 
hero as well — of later and more sophisticated 
romance, — by virtue, that is, of the position of 
picaresque literature as an episode in the history 
of the novel, — that Professor Chandler claimed 
a larger interest for his work than its specialized 
character might otherwise have warranted. But 
he developed tJiis interesting thesis largely by 
implication, promising to make it erplicit in a 
later work, which should rest on the strong 
foundation afforded by a scholarly investigation 
of Spanish origins. 

And now Professor Chandler has fulfilled his 
promise. We do not mean to imply that he 
necessarily regards •• The Literature of Ro- 
guery. ' just published in two volumes by Messrs. 
Houghton, ilifflin & Co. in tieir "Types of 
English Literature " Series, as a substitute for 
the projectcil Part II. of his earlier work ; but 
we are satisfied to accept it as such, hoping, how- 
ever, that he will continue to make further con- 
tributions to a subject which, in its endless and 
delightful ramifications, he has made peculiarly 
his own. Indeed, we feel that he r^lly owes 
ns at least one more volume as a forfeit for his 
choice of too general a title for this one. Some 
of the most delightful rascals in literature are 
quite outside the main trend of the novel's de- 
velopment, and if the ballad ra-scaLs, Bums's and 
Father Prout's heroes, and the rogues so deftly 
sketched in by essayists like Lamb, Leigh Hunt, 
and Douglas Jerrold, receive only casual con- 
sideration or entire omission in a volume en- 
titled '• The Literature of Roguery." the author 
surely ought to make suitable repiaration, espec-

dler. In two Tolnmes. Boston : Houghton, Jtifflin & Co. 



iallv when he is as oompetait to do so as Pro- 
fessor Chandler. 

As has been already suggested. Professor 
! Chandler's new book is a study of the develop- 
\ ment oi one branch of modem fiction. The 
preface states the purpose of the work so accu- 
rately and so interestingly tihat it deserves to 
be quoted in fidl, but an excerpt must suffice. 

" In the broadest sense, this history follows the for- 
tnnes of the anti-hero in literature. More narrowly, it 
is a study of realism, for it investigates the role enacted 
in literary art by the observation of low-life. Speeifl- 
callv, it traces in English letters a notable series of 
gradations from the first crude records of actuality to 
the complete re-sha{Mng of experience by the imagination, 
and in this process it points a constant tendency toward 
romanbcism, counteracted at times by fresh returns to 
fact. It aims therefore to do a three-fold service: first, 
to exhibit in its origins and organic growth a body of 
literature of considerable extent and intrinac interest; 
secondly, to trace the development of anti-heroism in 
letters as reflecting the disintegrating play of the forces 
of evil in society ; and thirdly, to exemplify a signifiout 
process and tendency in art." 

In accordance with this plan, the opening 
chapter defines the rogue as differentiated from 
other delinquent types, and the literature of pre- 
ponderant roguery as differentiated from that 
in which the anti-hero is only a minor character 
or a mere foil for the virtuous hero. It then 
takes a rapid survey of the early stages of the 
rascal romance in Spain, France. Germany, and 
Holland. Next follows an account of roguery 
in English literature as it was developed through 
the Georgian era, at which point the first volume 
closes. With the consideration of the eighteenth 
century novelists, the study necessarily becomes 
more limited, more detailed, and for the general 
reader probably more interesting. With the 
possible exception, however, of a part of the 
first chapter, there is nothing esoteric or aca- 
I demic about Professor Chandler's work. Indeed, 
i its greatest charm lies in its peculiar oombin- 
i ation of authority- with htiman interest, of 
I scholarly methods and an imposing bibliography 
j with a fine sense of proportion, — a lai^ grasp 
! of the matter as a whole and in its relation to 
other lines of literary research. The style has 
the same two^ged appeal ; it is keen, clear-cut, 
subtle, keeping the fine line between the easy 
dogmatism of ignorance and the over-qualified 
hesitancy of the absorbed student, oppressed by 
masses of detail. 

It is of course impossible to make adequate 
comment upon any part of Professor Chandler's 
study in a brief review. Investigators in related 
fields will like to know that there are complete 
bibliographies for every section of every chapter ; 



316

[Nov. 16, 



and they will be particularly interested in orig- 
inal studies of types like the anatomy of roguery 
and the criminal biography, which are here for 
the first time defined and brought into connec- 
tion with imaginative literature. On the other 
hand, the general reader — to employ a much 
abused term — wiU enjoy such topics as roguery 
in recent fiction, cockney rogueries, and Borrow's 
and Thackeray's rascals (the two authors are 
classed together under the suggestive heatling, 
" Sympathetic and Satiric Rogtie Realism "). 
The reader will appreciate, too, the catholic 
taste and the open-mindedness which show the 
same interest in modern detective tales and 
seventeenth-century jest-books, and which link 
Greene's conny-catching pamphlets with Flynt's 
" Tramping with Tramps," and the Georgian 
dramas with Pinero's " Profligate " and 
McLellan's " Leah lOeshna." 

Professor Chandler imderstands the arts of 
apt quotation and trenchant summary. As in 
his first book, he develops his second and third 
theses largely by suggestion, stating facts at 
length and conclusions briefly, and depending 
upon the sympathy and good judgment of his 
readers to amplify whatever part of his thesis 
interests them most. One issue not explicitly 
stated in the preface is the development of the 
aesthetic concept of roguery from the naive 
gaiety of the ^icaro or the crude outline sketches 
offered in early treatments of the Robin Hood 
and Robin Goodfellow legends, to the sophisti- 
cation of a Becky Sharp, a Pringle, or a Tom 
Sawyer, and finally to the evasion of the whole 
moral issue as personified in Dr. Weir Mitchell's 
Quack, in Kipling's " Soldiers Three," in Raffles, 
gentleman thief, and in Sherlock Holmes, 
detector of crime, but possessed of all the sang 
froid, dash, and daring that in earlier literature 
are the special prerogatives of the rogue him- 
self. All this is of course implied in a study of 
rogue literature, but Mr. Chandler's method 
brings it into special prominence ; and many 
readers will find it the most interesting feature 
of his work. 

To illustrate the unusual distinction of Mr. 
Chandler's style, we make a few quotations, 
chosen almost at random. Of Jonathan Wild 
he writes : 

" England sank to the nadir of social misrule in the 
first third of the eighteenth century, and its prince of 
darkness was Jonathan Wild. He represents the acme 
of professionalism in crime. As a terror inspirer he has 
long been invoked by novelists and dramatists, and every 
criminal chronicle holds him its darling." 

Again, in placing Defoe in the picaresque 
stream, he says : 



" Defoe had no perception of fine shades of character 
or of character-development; the feelings he presents 
are the simplest; and emotion with him is the exception 
rather than the rule. Maternal afl:ection, for example, 
although Moll Flanders is the mother of twelve children, 
finds no expression in action, and but little in words." 

In speaking of some of Dickens's rogues he 
writes : 

" Dotheboys Hall of Wackford Squeers is as much a 
place of torment as the school of Doctor Cabra attended 
by Don Pablos. But Dickens's earnestness of purpose 
and special plea for educational i-eform, if they favor 
over-emphasis, are in contrast with the rollicking trav- 
esty of the Spaniard. Squeers is a rascal, deserving of 
his sentence to transportation. . . . The plotting felon, 
Brooker, and the swindler, Sir Mulberry Hawk, verge on 
the villainous; but the itinerant Crummies family and 
sly Mantalini, gone to the demnition bow-wows, are 
pleasantly picaresque." 

Finally, we wiU let Mr. Chandler's concluding 
paragraph state what he feels that his book has 
accomplished. 

" As a force moulding literary history the English 
literature of roguery has proved most potent in affect- 
ing the drift of the drama in the early seventeenth 
centui-y, in cooperating to create the novel in the eight- 
eenth century, and in amplifying the scope of that novel, 
and in producing the detective story in the nineteenth 
centmy. If it has stood at a far remove from art in 
such departments as the anatomies of roguery and the 
criminal biographies, and in such a work as "The 
English Rogue," it has also achieved artistic distinction 
in the later fiction, and it has reckoned among its 
devotees many whose names rank high in the annals of 
literature. Most picturesque in the days of Elizabeth, 
most immoral in the days of the Stuarts, and most earnest 
and at the same time most merry under the Georges, it 
has become since the advent of the nineteenth century 
most diffused, complex, and varied. Now it views sordid 
actuality in the dry light of reason; now it yields to the 
play of imagination and of sentiment; now it is merely 
ingenious. It receives the tribute alike of the roman- 
ticist and of the realist. It adapts itself equally well to 
the purposes of the moralist and to those of the jester, 
to the propaganda of the humanitarian reformer, or to 
the inventions of the light-hearted teller of tales. To 
entertain has ever been its purpose, but although much 
of it has done only this, in the main the genre has 
acquired significance in so fai" as it has also subserved 
the ends of satire, or revealed the mannei's and life of 
the underworld, or contributed to an understanding of 
character, or furthered a study of social conditions with 
a view to social improvement. In some or all of these 
directions the literature of roguery has successfully 
adventured in the past, and these remain the pathways 
open to its progress in the future."

Recent Fiction.* 



The figurative application of a Scriptural text is 
a favorite device of Mrs. Wharton's, and it again 
appears in " The Fruit of the Tree," her latest work 
of fiction. A note of seriousness, and of deep under- 
lying purpose, is thus struck by the very title-page ; 
and it need hardly be said at this late day that, 
besides its accomplished artistry, Mrs. "Wharton's 
■work alwaj's gives us the sense of ethical responsi- 
bility. Her latest theme is perhaps the most daring 
that she has dealt with, and certainly the one which 
most demands a responsible attitude, for the par- 
ticular case of conscience here brought under her 
analysis is that of the right to shorten human life 
when its prolongation means only suffering with no 
attendant hope of recovery. Such action as this is 
justified (in theory) by many people who take life 
seriously and look it squarely in the face, although 
the law g^ves the action no countenance, and the 
instinctive inheritance of many centuries of Christian 
civilization causes most of us to recoil with horror 
from the suggestion. And even those who are })er- 
suaded to give theoretical approval to the principle 
would find it impossible to foimulate a safe working- 
rule for its application. We fancy that the con- 
sciousness of this difficulty, almost as much as the 
instinctive revolt against any violation of the sanctity 
of human life, helps to line up the professional 
moralists in a solid opposing phalanx whenever the 
humanitarian plea for mercy to the condemned suf- 
ferer is voiced. On the other hand, the sternest 
champion of the law, whether moral or civil, which 
forbids the taking of human life, would be likely to 
weaken inwardly when confronted by some partic- 
ularly heart-rending case of agony for which no na- 
tural end but death is possible, and which might be 
summarily ended with relief to all concerned. In 
such a case, the ethical philosophy which is no more 
than a calculus of pleasure and pain is apt to make 
all idealistic systems appear ineffectual. And the 
one who should, in such a case, translate this phil- 
osophy into action, although a criminal in the eyes 
of the law, would at least be entitled to a certain 
awful kind of sympathy. These are among the 
reflections that come to us whUe reading Mi-s. Whar- 
ton's novel. As a conscious artist, she realizes that 
it is not her business to take sides, but rather to 
present a concrete example, and leave her readers

to react upon it in their special modes of pity and 
indignation. It is such an example that she has 
presented, with moving effect, in " The Fruit of the 
Tree." Perhaps we get as near as anywhere to the 
author's point of ^-iew in the following passage about 
the woman whose act is held before our gaze : " She 
accepted the last condition as she had accepted the 
other, pledged to the perpetual expiation of an act 
for which, in the abstract, she stiU refused to hold 
herself to blame. But life is not a matter of abstract 
principles, but a succession of pitiful compromises 
with fate, of concessions to old tradition, old beliefs, 
old charities and frailties. That was what her act 
had taught her - — that was the word of the gods to 
the moi-tal who had laid a hand on their bolts." He 
would be a harsh moralist, who, in the presence of 
the poignant tragedy portrayed in this book, should 
maintain that the woman's punishment does not meas- 
ure up to her desert, and who should not be able to 
make large allowances for an act which, however 
inti'insicaUy horrible, is the outcome of the purest 
pity and the tenderest love. 

The great San Francisco earthquake now makes 
its appearance in fiction, serving as an effective 
climax to Mrs. Atherton's new international novel. 
The book is entitled '' Ancestors," for no more dis- 
cernible reason than is offered by the fact that the 
heroine is of Spanish origin, and is supposed to 
exhibit certain ancestral traits. However, novelists 
nowadays are hard pressed for titles, and almost 
anything will serve. Mrs. Atherton's hero is a 
young Englishman in political life — a sort of 
Rosebery-Cnrzon-ChurchiU blend — who becomes a 
peer much to his disgust, and is thereby precluded 
from what has seemed to be his destined leadership 
of the Commons. The heroine is an American 
cousin from California, who at this juncture per- 
suades him to forsake English politics, come to 
America, and there carve out for himself a new 
career. About a third of the book is taken up by 
these preliminaries, and then the scene is shifted to 
California, where it remains for something over four 
hundred pages. The English peer becomes plain 
John Gwynne, a rancher, and a student of political 
life in his new home. The fact that, by an accident 
of travel, he had been born in Vir^nia, permits him 
to claim American citizenship by a technicality, and 
supports the visionary suggestion that he may be 
eligible for the presidency. When the story closes, 
however, he has got no farther toward this goal than 
a sort of local leadership. But he gets his American 
cousin before the curtain falls, which is what the 
novel-reader chiefly demands. The strength of this 
book is found in its intimate depiction of California, 
both natural and social. Here the author is on firm 
ground (to speak with only figurative intent), and 
writes whereof she knows, albeit with some exagger- 
ation and erudeness of coloring. But the story is 
made fairly tedious by endless passages of analysis 
and discussion, and its inordinate length is not 
justified by a corresponding richness of invention 
and imagination. Of its style there is not much ot

say. It exhibits rawness rather than refinement, 
and is ahnost wholly devoid of charm. 

Another novel of the international type is " The 
Shuttle," by Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett. Here 
again we have a title with only the vaguest sort of 
relevancy, one that has to be justified by the occar 
sional insertion of figurative reflections upon the web 
of comity that fate is weaving between the shores 
of England and America. In the present case it is 
a snarl that is woven rather than a web, for the story 
starts with an international marriage that proves most 
distressing in its results. Suffice it to say tliat the 
bride, who is the daughter of an American magnate 
of fabulous wealth, is so cowed by the brutality of 
her noble and vicious spouse that she supinely places 
her fortune in his hands, ceases to communicate 
with her own family, and sinks into the position of a 
drudge, an unconsidered appendage of his decayed 
household. This situation is, of course, improbable 
to the verge of being preposterous, but it provides a 
setting for the main part of the story, which begins 
when Betty appears upon the scene. Betty is the 
younger sister of the abused wife, and as soon as 
she reaches the age of discretion, she starts for Eng- 
land on the mission, long cherished in secret, of dis- 
covering and rescuing the lost member of the family. 
She arrives at a time when the villainous husband 
is absent in parts unknown, grasps the situation, and 
presently dominates it. Her doings are of a nature 
to astonish the natives and everybody else, and when 
the husband re-appears, he discovers that he has a 
new member of his household, a rehabilitated estate, 
and a wife who shows signs of possessing a will of 
her own. These phenomena surprise him at first, and 
then make him more malignantly villainous than he 
had been before — there can be no doubt that in this 
portrayal Mrs. Burnett gives us good measure. The 
element of sentimental romance in the book is pro- 
vided by Betty's relations with a neighbor, an im- 
poverished nobleman, a figure of the taciturn-heroic 
type, whom everyone but Betty misjudges. She dis- 
covers him to be a diamond of the purest water, al- 
though a rough one, and all is well in the end, save 
for the villain, with whom all is ill, yet not ill in 
proportion to his deserts. Betty seems to us an un- 
usually fine character; fine, that is, in the sense of 
artistic and sympathetic portrayal. The story is a 
long one, and might be shortened to its advantage. 

Mr. Friedman, in '' The Radical," gives us 
another variant upon the well-worn theme of the 
political leader engaged in the struggle with the 
hydra-headed (or octopus-footed) monster of corrup- 
tion. His hero makes his way upward by sheer 
strength of character and rugged honesty. After 
he has served his apprenticeship in munici])al and 
state politics, he becomes a Representative at Wash- 
ington, and eventually a Senator. But after this, 
his career does not present the record of successful 
achievement so popular with the novelists who por- 
tray this type of character; for our author gives us 
the novelty of a hero who is defeated in the end, and 
forced to succumb to the forces of evil arrayed against 



him. Probably Mr. Friedman is not quite as pessi- 
mistic as this outcome would seem to indicate, for 
the closing page seems to hint that we are not 
through with the hero, whose last recorded words, 
as he departs from Washington, are to the effect 
that the White House has both a front and a back 
door. Still, a story of this type which ends in de- 
feat is something of a novelty, and attention must 
be called to the fact. The scene of Mr. Friedman's 
story is placed, for the most part, in the national 
capital, and it is evident that the author has spent 
some time there, note-book in hand. He is well- 
equipped with the facts of political life, and with the 
social 8ymJ)athies needed for their effective interpre- 
tation. He writes as an avowed spokesman of our 
present-day militant democracy, which is probably 
as biased, in its own way, as the effete aristocracy 
which it antagonizes. And we must add that the 
present book, in the details of its workmanship, is 
not as finished a production as the author's previous 
writings would lead us to expect. 

Things happen to a sui-prising extent in the novels 
of Mr. Randall Parrish, and more of them than 
usual happen in "Beth Norvell," his latest fiction. 
The scene is in the mining region of Colorado, the 
hero is a mining engineei', and the heroine a young 
woman who has run away from her villainous hus- 
band, and is supporting herself by enacting various 
parts as leading lady of a theatrical company. 
The hero succumbs when he first sees her, and 
applies for a position as scene-shifter and general 
utility man with her troupe. This enables him to 
be on hand at various critical junctm-es, and he 
knows how to utilize his opportunities. In the end 
the villain is conveniently disposed of, and all is well. 
It is all melodrama of a rather preposterous sort, 
and the hero's conversation is a little more prepos- 
terous than anything else in the book. 

Another story of the West, but one considerably 
more serious in artistic intent, is "Money Magic," 
by Mr. Hamlin Garland. The hero is a reformed 
gambler and the heroine an emancipated "biscuit- 
shooter." The gambler reforms because that is the 
condition the " biscuit^shooter" imposes upon him, 
and her emancipation is from the drudgery of the 
country hotel in which her days have been spent. 
Just as this arrangement has been effected between 
the two, a " bad man " gets the gambler off his guard, 
and "fills him with lead." (We drop into these 
playful idioms as a natural consequence of associa- 
tion with the unspoiled figures of Western romance.) 
The gambler is supposed to be on his death-bed, and 
a marriage is hastily contrived ; but he unexpectedly 
recovers, although remaining a cripple. The couple 
now remove to the Springs, where they occupy a 
jjalatial residence, and get into "society." The 
woman develops possibilities, which a young lawyer 
(who now comes into the foreground ) is quick to per- 
ceive. Various affecting scenes then follow, grow- 
ing out of the wife's struggle with her awakened self, 
and the pathetic self-effacement of the husband. The 
effacement is finally made complete, and the story

ends with a new life in prospect for his widow. There 
is a certain amount of truth in this narrative, and 
fairly effective characterization, although the latter 
most be described as crude rather than subtle. Mr. 
Garland has done much better work than this, and 
will, we trust, do it again. 

" Whatever thy task, thou art even as one who 
twists the thread and throws the shuttle weaving the 
web of Life. Ye are all weavers, and Allah the 
Merciful, does He not watch beside the loom ? " 
This impressive quotation (is it from the Koran ?) 
at once introduces and sets the keynote for "The 
Weavers," a new novel by .Sir Gilbert Parker. The 
words presage breadth of treatment and a serious 
nnderljang purpose. Their omen is not without 
fulfilment, for the author has embodied their mes- 
sage in a work that, despite certain quite obvious 
faults, is nevertheless endowed with unity of design 
and fine idealism. The faults may be dismissed 
with a few words. They are found in a somewhat 
heavy and repetitious style, an excess of melo- 
dramatic action and of Egyptian local color, and an 
element of what is intended to be comic relief, 
provided by a stray American whose language and 
conduct are alike impossible. Allowing for all these 
things, there remains a tale of varied and absorbing 
interest, the most ambitious and probably the most 
successful of Sir Gilbert's writings. The story is of 
Egypt fifty years ago, but of an Egypt brought into 
such relations with England as to justify the large 
share of attention given to English scenes and 
characters. The author has imagined a young 
Englishman of Quaker nurture, transferred by acci- 
dent, as it were, to the Egyptian court, and placed 
in a position of such responsibility that the destinies 
of the country are in his hands. There is a little of 
Lord Cromer and a good deal of Gordon in his 
make-up, and his career is in many respects strik- 
ingly like that of the last-named Englishman, whose 
personality and situation in the eighties have been 
borrowed for the uses of this romance of the sixties. 
Particularly is this description true of the relations 
between our Quaker David and the home govern- 
ment, which supports him in a half-hearted way, and 
finally abandons him to his fate. More fortunate 
than Gordon, however, he is saved from his desper- 
ate peril, and his enemies are routed when all hope 
seems lost. This situation provides a tense climax 
for a work that lays a strong hold upon our sympa- 
thies, and that depicts, in a manner that is something 
more than superficial, the sharp contrast, if not the 
deep essential antagonism, between East and West. 
Sir GUbert is a man of the world whose thought is 
tinged by poetic imagination, and it is to this unusual 
combination that the effectiveness of his work is due. 

" Lord Cammarleigh's Secret " is a diverting tale 
by Mr. Roy Horniman. By way of anticipating its 
strain upon the reader's credulity it is styled "a 
fairy story of to-day " upon the title-page, and with 
this warning we are measurably prepared to be sur- 
prised. Granted, however, a single initial impossi- 
bility, the story goes on smoothly and naturally 



enough; and this, we take it, represents a more 
artistic metho<l of dealing with the impossible than 
that which demands our acceptance of new miracles 
in every chapter. The hero is an audacious youth 
of parts, introduced to us upon the verge of starvation. 
At his wits' ends, he one day comes across Lord 

' Cammarleigh, whom he has never seen before, notes 
a look of terror upon his face, and whispers to him 
dramatically : " I know your secret." Thereupon 
he is at once taken into his lordship's household, 
installed as private secretary, given the power of the 
purse, and made practically master of position and 
fortune. He uses the opportunity to such excellent 
effect that he eventually marries an aristocratic 

I maiden, gets a seat in Parliament, and sequestrates 
for his own benefit a large share of Cammarleigh's 
fortune. As for the secret, he never finds it out, 
and, what is worse, even the reader gets no hint of 
its nature. But it is dark and deadly enough to 
make Cammerleigh a puppet in the hero's hands, 
and to give ns the delight of following the career 
of a particidarly eng^aging adventurer.

The hittory 
of tlavery 
m Cuba. 



Since the reversal in our foreign and 
colonial policies which has taken 
place since 1898, American students 
are devoting more attention to the history of Latin- 
America. The most recent product of investigation 
in that field is " A Historj' of .Slaverj- in Cuba, 1511 
to 1868 " (Putnam), by Herbert H. S. Aimes. The 
title is too comprehensive, since the only subject 
treated is the slave-trade to Cuba, legal and illegal. 
The author traces the history of the trade from the 
beginning to the end, describing the policy of Spain, 
the desires of the Cuban planters, the methods of 
the traders, attempts at suppression, and the slave- 
trade in international politics, with here and there 
some remarks upon the economic situation in Cuba 
and its relation to the slave trafiSc In a sense, this 
is a scholarly work. It is the result of much labor, 
and is based upon the best authorities, Spanish, 
French, and English, both documentary and printed. 
But the narrative in which the author presents the 
results of his work is something fearful and wonder- 
ful in its raw and careless crudeness. It would seem 
that no effort was made to give the work a clear and 
readable form. At times it is difficult to under- 
stand the author's meaning; there is unnecessary 
word coining ; technical terms are not sufficiently 
explained ; quotations are not well introduced, and 
indirect quotations are in bad form ; too many 
minute facts are given, and not enough effort is 
exerted to work them into a logical narrative, — in 
fact, the author seems to have lost himself in his 
mass of details. But in spite of all these defects, 
we can dig out, with the author's assistance, certain 
general conclusions, such as these : the Spanish 
government was desirous of limiting the slave trade :

[Nov. 16, 



the Cuban planters wanted more slaves than they 
were permitted to import, though at times they 
showed a lively sense of the danger of having large 
numbers of negroes; but few female slaves were 
imported for a long time, and thus the slave trade 
was considered more necessary ; though illegal after 
about 1820, it was practically impossible to prevent 
the smuggling in of slaves in large numbers. Of 
enlightening comment and well developed conclu- 
sions, there is a distinct lack. There is no descrip- 
tion of the plantation economy in Cuba. The point 
of view of the author is unusual : he writes of the 
slave-trade in exactly the same spirit that he would 
write of the sugar-trade ; there is no horror of the 
ti-affic, no preaching, no apology, no defense or attack. 
Throughout the book one finds expressed the author's 
opinion that for the development of Cuba slave labor 
was needed and Spain should have allowed unlimited 
traffic in Africans — an opinion not warranted by 
the experience of the past nor proved sound by 
conditions of to-day. 

Mr. A. C. Benson's "Tennyson" 
artrdi^r^af;.' (D'ltton) is written with a threefold 

object, — "(1) to give a simple 
narrative of the life of Tennyson, with a sketch of 
his temperament, character, ideals, and beliefs; (2) 
I have tried from his own words and writings to 
indicate what I believe to have been his view of the 
poetical life and character ; (3)1 have attempted 
to touch the chief characteristics of his art from the 
technical point of view, here again as far as possible 
using his own recorded words." The book gives us 
Mr. Benson at his best, lingering in the quiet of his 
study over the pages of a beloved author, and desir- 
ing, as he says, " to share with others an inheritance 
of pure and deep delight." Nothing new is offered, 
or attempted, in the brief outline of the poet's life, 
nor is there anything novel or startling in the dis- 
cussion of his works and his art ; but a quiet sym- 
pathy, a genial appreciation, pervades the book and 
makes it most enjoyable, even inspiring, reading. 
The author holds with FitzGerald, and with many 
less critical readers, that Tennyson's early poems 
were his best, that his " real gift was the lyric g^ft," 
and that " while he continued careless of name and 
fame he served his own ideal best." In charging 
Tennyson with obscurity in the speeches he puts into 
the mouths of his characters, as in " The Princess " 
and the " Idylls " — an obscurity even surpassing 
that of Browning — he goes too far. Tennyson 
never throws grammar and syntax to the winds, nor 
does he make his verse stagger under a load of 
obscure and unimportant Italian allusion. Some of 
Tennyson's terse and humorous comments on his 
brother poets throw gleams of light on the concep- 
tion he had of his art. Wordsworth, for his lack of 
fire, seemed to him " thick-ankled "; of Ben Jonson 
he said, " To me he appears to move in a wide sea 
of glue "; and Horace's Sapphic stanza, he used to 
declare, " is like a pig with its tail tightly curled." 
Mr. Benson's style is, as usual, of so scholarly an

excellence that it is a little disturbing to catch him 
writing of a " perspicuous critic." Surely, so accom- 
plished a classicist ought not to ignore the distinction 
between perspicuus and perspicax. The inter- 
spersed comments on Tennyson's metres tend to 
show what an amazing command of his instrument 
the poet had. In fact, the whole book sends one 
back to the poems themselves with increased admi- 
ration and renewed zest. 

" Factors in Modern History " (Put- 
nam) is the promising though some- 
what indefinite title of a recently 
published volume of lectures by the eminent English 
historian, Professor A. F. Pollard of the University 
of London. The author's purpose is, however, not 
so broad as the title-page would suggest: his aun is 
to point out and discuss the nature of the forces 
that directed the course and shaped the events of 
English history during the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries, the Tudor and Stuart periods. The work 
is therefore not a history as that word is commonly 
understood ; it is not a re-statementof historic events, 
but an effort to bring out the significance that lies 
beneath the ordinary well-known facts of the period 
under discussion. Among other " factors," the author 
discusses nationality, the rise of the middle class, 
the growth of parliamentary independence, the new 
monarchy, conflicting religious and political ideas, 
and colonial expansion. On some of these subjects 
Professor Pollard offers little that is either novel or 
startling, but in every case the manner of treatment 
is interesting and suggestive. Of greatest interest 
is the author's review of the early Tudor period, in 
which he re-states the conclusions published in his 
biographies of Cranmer, Henry VIII., and the Pro- 
tector Somerset. He still holds that while Henry 
VIII. was only in a minor degree responsible for the 
Anglican reformation, he was directly responsible 
for the growth of parliamentary vigor and inde- 
pendence that proved so fatal to the pretensions of 
the Stuarts. As he reads the records, there was 
more tyranny, more coercion, more interference 
with parliamentary freedom, in the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth than in that of her father. It will interest 
the reader to note that to emphasize the virtues of 
the "flexible " British constitution Professor Pollard 
contrasts it with our own, under which neither 
House nor ministry " can remove the other ; they 
can only annoy one another, and impede one 
another's action until the period preordained by the 
Constitution has elapsed." The work closes with a 
lecture on the present condition of historic study at 
the University of London, which is interesting for 
its own sake, but hardly belongs in a volume 
devoted to the " factors in modern history." A 
word should be added in appreciation of the author's 
literary style: the reviewer recalls no other discus- 
sion that brings out the humor of history so freely 
and so delightfully. Professor Pollard's latest work 
is one that lovers of history will read with enjoy- 
ment as well as with profit.

" I am a natural-born mountebank," 
teif-eonfetted frankly declares Mr. Bernard Shaw, 
movnubank. ^^^ jj jg jjjjg unabashed admission of 
all that is charged against him that makes him a 
rather piquantly interesting and oddly amusing 
figure to contemplate in the brief study of his life and 
work offered by Mr. Holbrook Jackson, published 
by Messrs. G. W. Jacobs & Co. Conceiving that 
the press and the public have failed to understand 
Mr. Shaw and to take him with sufficient seriousness. 
Mr. Jackson has presented him. carefully and admir- 
ingly drawn, in fourfold phase, — "The Man," "The 
Fabian," *■ The Plaj-wright," and " The Philosopher." 
The book is well written, and, in its biographical 
pages esj)ecially, highly entertaining. Its subject is 
certainly a man of unusual endowments, and is just 
now making himself heard in tones that men cannot, 
or will not, shut their ears to. As the author says 
that 'Six. Shaw looks upon himself, not primarily as 
an artist, but as a philosopher, we need not here pass 
judgment on his books and plays, but may content 
ourselves with querying whether his philosophy, 
despite the attention it is now commanding, will 
prove to have in it anything of permanent worth. 
He wakes up the drowsy, and makes them gasp and 
stare ; but (to use the language of pragmatism) new 
truth, in order to vindicate its claim to be truth at 
all, must not merely be novel and forward-reaching, 
but must at the same time be sufficiently in harmony 
with old and accepted truth to coalesce with it and 
grow naturally from it. Nature makes no leaps, and 
your saltimhanque is a prodigious leaper. In other 
words, are we ready to throw overboard the greater 
number of our cherished ideals, to hold with this 
new philosopher that '• duty is what one should never 
do," to bow down to the Life-force as the supreme 
object of our worship, to intermit our homage to cour- 
age and justice and fidelity and ehastit}-, and all the 
other old-fashioned virtues ? Shall we cease to 
demand in our prophets and teachers that modest 
dignity and self-respecting reserve that seem to us 
(whether rightly or wrongly) so sadly lacking in the 
brilliant author of " Man and Superman " ? How- 
ever he may entertain and even stimulate at times, 
it seems absurd to compare him. as does Mr. Jackson,

"improrabw (Crowell), by Dr. William Elliot 
woTid-raef. GrifiBs, the well-known writer on 

Japanese affairs, is a popular resuml of the impor- 
tant events in the history of Japan, from the earliest 
times to the beginning of the present year. The 
author is conceded to be the best informed Ameri- 
can on the subject concerning which he writes. He 
was the first of that army of foreigners (the number 
is not less than five thousand) who have been called 
into the service of Japan in pursuance of the cele- 
brated Charter Oath taken by the Mikado in 1868, 
his arrival in the flowerj' kingdom dating back to 
January, 1871. Dr. Griffis is an enthusiastic ad- 
mirer of the Japanese, and his story of the growth 



of their civilization, to which he has contributed no 
small share himself, is marked by a spirit of genuine 
svmpathy and good-will. Of the influence exerted 
by foreigners in Japan, he says, they not only sowed 
the first seeds of faiowledge, but that they created 
new sciences, inaugurated railroad and telegfraph sys- 
tems, built steamships and lighthouses, and in a thou- 
sand ways taught the Japanese how to utilize the 
forces of nature, develop their national resources, and 
improve the condition of man. He considers the 
Japanese the most " improvable " race in Asia, if not 
in the world. In spirit, body, institutions, mental 
initiative, and methods of life, they are, Dr. Griffis 
declares, radically un-Mongolian, and should not be 
classed as Mongolians ; indeed, they refuse to be 
classed as such. He praises the alliance with Great 
Britain, and says the Japanese owe the British peo- 
ple more than money for their friendship. Of 
Japan's position as a world-power. Dr. Grifhs writes 
interestingly. He denies that her statesmen are ani- 
mated by any policy of aggression, and affirms that 
her highest ambition is self-preservation. 

Mr. W. W. Bryant, who has charge 
Attronomy £ ^ magnetic and meteorologi^ 

up to date. , , , ^ . i /-,, 

work of the Greenwich Observatory, 

has written a •' History of Astronomy " ( Dutton) 
which is neither so long as to repel a reader whose 
time is limited, nor so short as to be unsatisfactory. 
The author has treated the ancient worthies in small 
compass, and devotes most of his book to a consid- 
eration of what has been done in this science during 
tbe last fifty years. Before that time, astronomical 
progress was associated almost entirely with the 
greatest exponents of the science, and the treatment 
of the subject is therefore almost necessarily bio- 
graphical. But during the past fifty years there 
have been so many worthy workers in various astro- 
nomical fields that the biographical treatment of the 
earlier times is supplemented by a topical one. Here 
wide and accurate knowledge is shown by the author, 
who brings the discussion of each topic thoroughly 
down to date ; in one case he inserts some informa- 
tion gained while the book was being printed. The 
reader is thus led to feel that the presentation is 
thoroughly modem. Upon disputed topics, like that 
of the supposed inhabitability of Mars, a conserva- 
tive opinion is expressed. Thirty-five plates of a 
high order illustrate the text. 

American A. new edition of Mr. Frederick 

1^7JJT Scott Oliver's "Alexander Hamilton, 
point of riew. an E^say on American Union " (Put- 
nam) gives opportunity to express renewed appre- 
ciation of this study of our Revolutionarj- and early 
national history from the English point of view. 
The author is a careful and judicial student, and 
the study is valuable in itself; but its chief value 
comes from the outside treatment of the period that 
has been most idealized by our own writers. The 
reader sometimes receives a mild shock when the 
traditional ideals are treated irreverently ; but the

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



treatment is never flippant. It seems impossible 
for any American writer to discuss the character 
and achievements of Hamilton without enthusiastic 
admiration or violent denunciation, according to 
the writer's political bias, so positive was Hamilton's 
character and so striking his achievements. Mr. 
Oliver is an ardent admirer without partisan pre- 
judices, seeing in Hamilton the guiding intellect in 
national affaii-s during the whole period of his ac- 
tivity. Rather scanty weight is allowed even to 
Washingfton's influence and initiative. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Ancient Hebrew Literature," in four volumes, edited 
by the Rev. R. Bruce Taylor, is a welcome addition to 
the " Everyman's Library " of the Messrs. Button. It 
is simply an edition of the Old Testament and Apocryplia, 
the books classified under such heads as law, history, 
philosophy, and poetry, and printed without artificial 
division into chapters and verses. The authorized ver- 
sion is the basis of the text, although absolute mistrans- 
lations are corrected. This set of volumes, together 
with the New Testament volume edited for the same 
series by Principal Lindsay, gives us a complete Bible 
that may be read as another book, with eyes unvexed by 
the typographical devices that make hard readmg of the 
Scriptures in the ordinary form of publication. 

A new volume has been added to the late Philip 
SchafE's " History of the Christian Church," the labor 
of cai'rying on the work having been undertaken by his 
son, Dr. David S. Sehafl. The special period of this 
volume is the Middle Ages, and, with another volume 
now in press, the work will be brought down to the 
Reformation. Thus the lacima left in the history by 
Philip Schaif's death will be filled, and the continuous 
history, in eight volumes, will be available for study and 
reference. Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are the pub- 
lishers of this, as of the precediugvoliunes. 

" A Book of Quotations, Proverbs, and Household 
Words," edited by Mr. W. Gurney Beuham, is a stout 
volume of more than twelve hundred pages, published 
by the J. B. Lippincott Co. It is described as "a collec- 
tion of what is quotable, as well as of what is quoted." 
The first third of the book is given up to quotations from 
individual authore; then we have groups of quotations 
imder various miscellaneous categories, and then neai-ly 
three hmidred pages of quotations from foreign lan- 
guages, ancient and modern. An extensive selection of 
pi-overbs follows, and an elaborate verbal index com- 
pletes the work. We know no other book of the kiud 
that contains so much matter, and we can heartily rec- 
ommend it as an additiou to the reference shelf. 

" Narratives of Early Virginia " is a new volume in 
the series of " Original Narratives of Early American 
History," published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 
It is appropriately and intelligently edited by the Presi- 
dent of the oldest of Virginia colleges. Dr. Lyon 
Gardiner Tyler. Selections from the doughty John 
Smith fill about two-thirds of the volume; the remain- 
ing contents include narratives and letters by George 
Percy, Lord De-la^Ware, Don Diego de Molina, Father 
Biard, John R»fe, and John Pory. The period covered 
is that from the first settlement to the dissolution of 
the Company in 1624 by the aggrieved monarch. 



Notes. 



The J. B. Lippincott Co. publish a new edition of Mr. 
J. W. Clark's " Cambridge," a very readable book with 
many illustrations. 

TroUope's " John Caldigate," in two volumes, is uow 
added by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. to their " Manor 
House " edition of the novelist. 

" A First Course in the Differential and Integral 
Calculus," by Professor William F. Osgood, is a college 
text-book just published by the Macmillan Co. 

" Forage Crops for Soiling, Silage, Hay, and Pasture," 
by Dr. Edward B. Voorhees, is now pubhshed by the 
MacmUlan Co. a.s a volume in their useful "Rural 
Science Series." 

" Water-LUies and How to Grow Tliem," by Messrs. 
Henry S. Conard and Henri Hus, is the latest addition 
to the " Garden Library " of Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
&Co. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co issue a new edition of 
Auerbach's " On the Heights," as translated by Mr. 
Simon Adler Stern, and first pubhshed over thirty 
years ago. 

" Golden Thoughts from the Gospels " and " Golden 
Thoughts from Sir Thomas Browne," the latter edited 
by Mr. Herbert Ives, are two pretty booklets published 
by the John Lane Co. 

" The Human Harvest," by Dr. David Starr Jordan, 
is a small but weighty book published by the American 
Unitarian Association. It contains two addresses, the 
titular essay, and tlie essay called " The Blood of the 
Nation," which appeared some years ago. 

" Montaigne " is the subject of a new volume of 
" French Classics for English Readers," as published by 
the Messrs. Putnam. The editor is Professor Adolphe 
Cohn, who has selected the essays from Florio's trans- 
lation, and contributed the usual introduction. 

" The Great Galleries of Europe " is the title of a 
series of booklets started by the H. M. Caldwell Co. 
They are books of pictures with practically no text, and 
the subjects of the four now issued are the Louvre, the 
Luxembourg, the National Gallery, and the Tate Gallery. 

What is probably the most desirable edition of Poe's 
poems is offered by the volume which forms a part of 
the edition of Poe's works, in ten volumes, edited by 
Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry a dozen years ago. 
The volume of the poems is now pubUslied separately 
by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 

Books about the music-dramas of Richard Wagner 
multiply apace. We now have " The Wagnerian Ro- 
mances," by Miss Gertrude Hall, who simply tells the 
stories, and, for some curious reason, tells them in the 
reverse of their chronological order. The John Lane 
Co. publish this book. From Messrs. Dodd, Mead & 
Co. we have " The Story of the Ring," by Mr. S. H. 
Hamer, a book which merely analyzes the plot, and illus- 
trates it in musical notation. 

We have frequently made mention of Mr. Albert F. 
Calvert's " Spanish Series " of illustrated guides to the 
treasures of Spanish Art. Two new volumes, " Toledo " 
and " Granada and the Alhambra," have just been added 
to the series, volumes of unusual thickness, and remark- 
able for the amount of descriptive and illustrative ma- 
terial they provide for a small price. Each of these 
volumes, in addition to the text, contains about five him- 
dred full-page photographic plates. The series is pub- 
lished by the John Lane Co.

CHICAGO'S New Bookstore 




ROWNE'S BOOKSTORE, in the Fine Arts Building on 
Michigan Boulevard, is now open and will be found 
well worth an early visit. In the planning and fitting 
of this new shop, the effect sought has been a combi- 
tion of the best features of a well-equipped bookstore 
with those of a choice home library. Through the 
cooperation of Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright as architect, the interior 
has been given a beauty and distinction, combined with special 
provision for the comfort and convenience of visitors, that make 
it unique among existing books'tores. 

In the selection of stock, the needs of all purses and all 
tastes have been considered. The latest publications will be 
found here in complete assortment ; while special prominence 
is given to the best editions of the best books in all departments 
of literature. 

A carefully-chosen stock arranged in the most convenient 
way, appropriate surroundings of a very unusual sort, expert 
service and assistance in the selection of purchases — these are 
the features by which BROWNE'S BOOKSTORE aims to secure 
the patronage of Chicago's discriminating book-buyers.

In this new book, which proves again and more emphatically than ever before his place as one of the best 
of story-tellers in this or any country, Mr. Page shows with all his skill, charm, and dramatic power how

skiU." — yashvUU American. 



THE BROKEN ROAD By a. e. w. mason. $1.50

THE LETTERS OF 



QUEEN VICTORIA 



A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence 
between the Years 1837 and 1861 

Published by Authority of His Majesty the King. Edited by ARTHUR CHRISTOPHER 

BENSON, M.A., and Viscount ESHER, G.C.V.O., K.C.B. With 40 Portraits. Medium 

8vo, 3 vols., pp. xix.-641; pp. xiv.-575; pp. xii.-657. With Complete Index and 

Pedigrees. Cloth extra, gilt top. $15.00 net. Expressage additional. 

" Much has been written concerning the reien of Queen Victoria, but nothing: that has hitherto appeared has thrown 
such light upon the subject as may be derived from the present volumes. In them we have an extraordinary record of the 
salient events in the period from her accession to the death of the Prince Consort, a record rendered the more interesting 
inasmuch as it takes a kind of autobiographical form. . . . The editorial machinery of this work is a model. The introductory 
summary of public affairs written for each chapter is always concise : the Queen, her ministers, and the members of her 
intimate circle are left to speak for themselves." — Is'ew Vork Tribune.

ESSAYS OUT OF HOURS

$1.00 net. By mail, $1.08. 

%* Any formality associated with the word essay is renounced by the title *' Out of Hours." The short essays collected 
here, mainly from the Atlatitie, are in the freer method of sug'grestion followed by those few writers who have cultivated the 
essay as a creative form. Seeking to start ideas by touching the reader's fancy, they speak always in the concrete. The 
longer essays in criticism interpret three diverse forms of literature by scrutinizing in each case the form itself as a work of art. 



NEWFOUNDLAND AND ITS UNTRODDEN WAYS 

By J. G, MILLAIS, F.Z,S,, author of " The Mammals of Great Britain 
and Ireland." Royal 8vo, 340 pages, with six colored plates, six 
photogravures, and 115 line and half-tone illustrations. $().00 net. 

This volume is a hunter's book dealing mainly with the natural history 
and the chase of the wild animals and birds of Newfoundland ; but in addi- 
tion to this the author has endeavored to set forth all that goes to make up 
the daily life of the people of that Island and the Micmac Indians. 

JOCK OF THE BUSHVELD : The Story of a Dog 

By Sir PERCY FITZPATRICK, author of "The Transvaal from

and very numerous border sketches of South African life, fauna, 
etc., by E. Caldwell. Square 8vo, pp. xvi.-475. $1.60 net. 

"The book is interesting to those who love the wilds as a faithful picture 
of the heroic days of the bushveld. . . . But it has another appeal, and the 
widest, for it is an ideal children's book, the best, in our opinion, since Mr" 
Kipling gave the world his Junsjle Books. It tells of the adventures of a 
bull-terrier named Jock — a dog cast in heroic mould, who deserves to live 
with Mr, OUivant's ' Owd Bob,' or, since he is on the Saga scale, with that 
great hound, ' Samr,' in the Saga of Burnt NJal." — The Spectator.

God's Calendar, by William A. Quayle 

This beautiful volume is the author's latest contribution to his very popular poetic 
nature studies. It contains a characteristic essay on the year as a whole and then on 
each month of the year, describing in Dr. Quayle's delightful way all the beauties and 
mysteries of the changing seasons. To dream through the ye<ir with Dr. Quayle as a 
guide," says The Mall i5f Times, to see nature through his poetic eyes, to have him 
make each month a living creature to you is to live close to the heart of things. You 
have never understood the beauty of the year as you do now, and each month has its 
priceless treasures to yield.

THE WORLD'S WORK 

MAKES LITERATURE OF WHAT IS NOW GOING ON. 
THERE IS RUNNING IN IT NOW, FOR INSTANCE: 

THE MONEY KINGS 

A series of articles by Mr. C. M. Keys, which show precisely how financial power con- 
centrates itself in New York ; how it is used; the men that use it ; and the inter-relations 
of financial activity. The whole vast business is shaping itself for a great change. 

LAND IN THE WEST, by Arthur W. Page. 

The public domain yet contains 900,000,000 acres — enough, if it were all usable, for 
more than ten acres for every man, woman, and child in the United States; how the 
Government makes land for the people by irrigation ; and how it saves grazing and 
timber and coal land for the people by enforcing the laws. 

THERE WILL APPEAR AT ONCE 

THE BUILDERS ~ 

Telling who the strong men are that are making our civilization and how they do it. 

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS, by Rollin M. Hartt. 

Whether parks, buildings, roads, streams, bridges — how at various places in the United 
States men are making the most of natural opportunities and building up our sense of beauty. 

HOW TO INVEST 

Every number of THE WORLD'S WORK contains a practical article, sane, un- 
biased, and preeminently conservative. The " Reader's Service" puts trained financial 
knowledge at the disposal of our readers without cost. Every letter seeking advice is 
treated confidentially. 

THE MARCH OF EVENTS 

This interpretation of events and tendencies gives a 
balanced, well-seasoned judgment of what happens 
and of men who are in the public eye. Many readers 
look to this as a help to forming sound judgments 
on the large subjects of the time. The president of 
a large New York Bank binds these comments as a 
history of our time. 

HEALTH AND THE RIGHT METHOD OF LIVING 

On this subject THE WORLD'S WORK has done 
the service to publish Dr. Gulick's notable writings ; 
and the subject will be continued. 

25 cents a number; $3.00 a year 

The bound volume for the six months ending with 
October, 1907, is now ready — $2.50. There is 
no more complete, concise and authoritative history 
of our time, and it should be in every library.

MONCURE D ANIE L CONWAY. 

It was a rich life, and a helpful one, that 
ended when Dr. Conway died in Paris, on the 
fifteenth of last month. It had covere<l just 
three- quarters of a century, and had entered into 
active relations with many of the most signi- 
ficant developments and personalities of the 
period. He said in his Autobiography published 
three years ago : 

" The eventualities of life brought me into close con- 
nection with some large movements of my time, and 
also with incidents little noticed when they oecnrred, 
which time has proved of more far-reaching effect than 
the immediately imposing events. I have been brought 
into personal relations with leading minds and characters 
which already are becoming quasi-classic figures to the 
youth around me, and already show the nsoal tendency 
of such figures to invest themselves with mythology." 

A life which may be described in such terms as 
these cannot fail to be of deep and instructive 
interest, and, now that its accounts are closed, 
many readers shoidd wish to make acquaintance, 
renewed or original, with the volumes which con- 
tain its autobiographical record. Few volumes 
of the kind are of equal interest, or equally 
deserving of thoughtful consideration. 

Probably the most essential characteristic of 
Dr. Conway's life was its open-mindedness, and 
the accompanying determination to know the 
truth of whatever matters occupied his atten- 
tion. A man must be singularly honest with 
himself to be able to escape, as completely as 
this man did, from the prison-house of wont 
and prepossession, to construct anew his per- 
sonal habitation of clear thinking and right 
living. Starting on his career as a narrow 
evangelical — a circuit-rider in ilaryland — he 
became a powerful exponent of liberal religious 
thought ; bom into a slaveholding family, and 
inheriting the prejudices of his social class, he 
became an impassioned ally of the abolitionists, 
incidentally liberating his own family slaves, 
and finding a new home for them on the free 
soil of Ohio. The readiness, thus illustrated, 
to let thought have its way, and to square the 
action with the idea, was the controlling prin- 
ciple of the noble life now brought to its close, 
and constitutes its fundamental title to our 
respect. 

The events of Dr. Conway's early life may 
be very briefly smnmarize<l. Dickinson College, 
Pennsylvania, was his alma mater, and gradu-

ated him at the age of seventeen. He studied 
law for a time, then went into the ministry. 
His adoption of Unitarianism was made at about 
the time when he became of age, and the change 
in his religious outlook was largely due to the 
influence of Emerson. This year of his majority 
he spent the summer at Concord, where he met 
the gentle sage with whom he was to become so 
intimately associated. A year of study in the 
Harvard Divinity School followed; it was the 
year of the Anthony Burns episode and of the 
Kansas-Nebraska bill, which matters confirmed 
the young man in his anti-slavery principles. 
During the next seven years, he occupied Uni- 
tarian pastorates in Washington and Cincin- 
nati. The Washington incumbency ended with 
a " fatal sermon," too outspoken for the slavery 
interest to stomach, and the preacher, charged 
with "desecration of his pulpit," was promptly 
dismissed. He removed to Cincinnati in 1856, 
and it was there that he was married. It was 
also there that he edited " The Dial," second of 
that name, a monthly magazine which lived 
exactly one year. 

The outbreak of the Civil War brought Dr. 
Conway to the East again, and engaged him in 
many intellectual and humane activities in the 
cause of the Union, which was to him emphat- 
ically the cause of freedom. Soon after the 
Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, he 
accepted an offer from England to lecture in 
that country. He thus entered upon what was 
to be a foreign sojourn of more than twenty years, 
during which time he acted as minister of the 
South Place Chapel in London, besides doing 
much work in journalism, scholarship, and lit- 
erature. He sums up in these words his record 
up to the time of his change of residence : 

"I had said my say in America; I had borne my 
testimony, as the Quakers say, in all the towns of Ohio, 
in every important town of New England, and in the 
chief cities of New York, in Philadelphia and surround- 
ing places, and in Washington. I had written innum- 
erable articles and letters in papers and magazines, and 
my two books on the crisis were in wide circulation. It 
appeared, therefore, a fair time for me to go for a few 
months to represent the moral and political situation as 
viewed by American anti-slavery people." 

The life of the score of years that followed, as 
we read of it in the Autobiography, is rich in 
many kinds of interest. Dr. Conway had the 
social instinct to a remarkable degree, and his 
combination of intellectual force with sweetness 
of temper won for him both the respect and the 
affection of a great number of the leading 
spirits of the time, on the Continent as well as in 
England. 



In 1875, Dr. Conway made a vacation visit 
to the United States, but it was not until 1884 
that he finally severed relations with his London 
congregation, and came home for good. This 
latter statement, however, needs much qualifica- 
tion, for he continued to make frequent journeys 
abroad, and, as we have seen, it was in a foreign 
land that his career came to an end. How far 
afield his wanderings took him appears from 
" My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East," 
that fascinating supplement to a fascinating 
Autobiography. His deep interest in the oriental 
religions made him eager to study them at first 
hand, and enter into personal relations with their 
leading exponents. Long before he made this 
pilgrimage he had published " The Sacred An- 
thology," a collection of passages from the great 
religious writings of the East, which had been 
one of his most widely-circulated books. Other 
books resiUting from his studies in comparative 
religion were " Deraonology and Devil Lore," 
" The Wandering Jew," and " Solomon and 
Solomonic Literature.' 

The literary activities of his later years were 
mainly devoted to subjects connected with 
American history. He had seen some of the 
most important parts of American history in 
the making, and had been deeply impressed 
with the fact that every historical happening 
tends to become quickly obscured by legend. 
In particular, he knew well from his own expe- 
rience how widely variant from the truth was 
the popular or legendary idea of the Civil War 
and its chief actors that had come to be gen- 
erally accepted a generation later. When he 
turned to make researches in our earlier annals, 
he kept this lesson at heart, and in the true spirit 
of exact scholarship went straight to the docu- 
mentary sources and did not allow traditions to 
cloud his vision or impair his judgment. His 
method is exemplified by his biographies of 
Edmund Randolph and Thomas Paine. His life 
of Paine, in fact, together with his critical edi- 
tion of Paine's writings, constitutes the chief 
literary monument of Dr. Conway's career. It 
revealed the subject as he really was, and dis- 
'pelled forever from all serious minds the bogy 
thatf or generations had been on pulpit exhibition 
for the pointing of a cheap and sensational moral. 

Dr. Conway's books, unless we except the 
Autobiography, will not perpetuate his memory 
with the wider public. His voluminous output 
of writing was either frankly ephemeral or nar- 
rowly specialized, and these are not the qualities 
that make for lasting fame. But the memory 
of his personality will be cherished for at least

another generation by those who were privileged 
to hold intercourse with him. He was one of 
the best of talkers and one of the sincerest of 
friends, and his s}^npathies radiated upon all 
who came within their range. He will be missed 
in his familiar haunts — the Century, and the 
Authors, and the homes that knew him as a loved 
and honored guest. But the sadness caused by 
his death wiU be tempered by the thought that 
he lived his life fully, and made the world abetter 
place than it would have been without him. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A NAVAL CAPTAIN AND A LITERARY STYLIST are UOt 

every day encountered in one and the same person ; but 
this unusual combination exists in Captain Alfred T. 
Mahan, whose books owe no small part of their popu- 
larity to the graceful and readable style in which they 
are written. In his new volume, " From Sail to Steam," 
one of the personally reminiscent chapters treats of the 
author's development of his own medium of expression, 
and shows that, whatever he may believe as to the poet, 
he holds that the prosateur is bom and made. With 
Dr. Johnson, he would reject the first spontaneous utter- 
ance and substitute the embellished and full-rounded 
period. His remarks, the fruit of his own experience as 
a writer, are of interest to anyone who holds a pen ; and 
is there anybody who does not? At the same time, just 
as one takes a malicious pleasure in convicting a gram- 
marian of a solecism, so one feels a mischievous tempta^ 
tion to expose one or two little faults of style in this 
admirable writer's observations on style. Among the 
" minute details " that seem to him " worthy of the ut- 
most care " is the following: " to avoid an adjective which 
belongs to one of two nouns being so placed as to seem 
to qualify both." " To avoid an adjective's being placed " 
would be correct (so the purists say) although awkward; 
better, " to avoid placing," etc., or " never to place," etc. 
The Captain tells us that he abhors the split infinitive, 
and we are not very fond of it ourselves; but he also 
shuns the relative " that." In this we think he deprives 
himself of a useful and indeed almost indispensable 
word. Where the relative clause completes the mean- 
ing of the antecedent, " that " is the proper pronoun to 
use, though " which " is often allowed to take its place. If 
the Captain will permit one further suggestion, would it 
not be well to make more generous provision for the sup- 
port of one's present participles? To leave a poor parti- 
ciple all alone, with no friendly noun or pronoun to lean 
against, is almost cruel. For example, in his recent 
entertaining magazine article on " Old-time Naval Offi- 
cers," our author says, speaking of the flag-officer and 
himself: " Going ashore one day with him for a constitu- 
tional, he caught sight of my necktie," etc. The sense 
is plain enough, but " going " agrees with neither " he " 
nor "necktie"; in fact, its hopeless disagreement 
amounts to a sort of grammatical dyspepsia. Again, ten 
lines further down the page: "Going ashore together 
one day for a walk, the surgeon smudged his clothes," 
etc. Once more : " Judging by my experience, . . . the 
life of an aide is literally that of a dog." How simple 
and satisfying to have put " judged " instead of " judg- I 



ing " ! But of course all this is unimportant. Perhaps, 
like the higher mathematics, this grammatical haLv 
splitting has a fascination inversely proportional to its 

utility. . . . 

Miss Alma-Tadema's sunny philosophy finds 
pleasant expression in her reported conversation regard- 
ing her forthcoming book on the simple life, the ethical 
basis of happiness, and kindred themes of interest to the 
homely philosopher that dwells in each one of us. " This 
book of mine," she is quoted as saying, ■' has never been 
published, and I came over here to give a few readings 
from it because I have always loved to read, and because 
I wanted to see my friends here, and I thought that 
would be a pleasant waj' of doing it. My book isn't at 
all a practical handbook of happmess. Perhaps some 
day I shall write a more practical book on the subject; 
but it seemed to me the ethical part, the spiritual basis, 
came first." To Miss Alma-Tadema, happiness is very 
much what Boston is to the true Bostonian. Just as to 
him Boston is not a geogi-aphical locality but rather a 
state of mind, so to this cheerful lady happiness is 
" something quite apart from outward circumstances; 
it is a matter of the mind," and , " if we have the 
right attitude of mind nothing can make us really 
unhappy." She does admit, however, after experience 
of an Atlantic voyage, that " seasickness damps one's 
ardor for life, though it doesn't last long." As to 
loneliness, she says: " I don't see how one can be lonely 
when there is always Nature; but I believe the best 
happiness comes from being always ready to give friend- 
ship and fellowship and affection, and to receive it." 
In all this, and in more which we do not quote, there is 
sanity and sense that could hardly be improved upon — 
unless one were to " beat the Dutch "; for Miss Laurence 
Alma-Tadema is the daughter of a Dutch father (as 
everyone knows), and so, if not exactly a daughter of 
Holland, is at least a granddaughter of that brave little 
country. . . . 

A NEW LIBRARY JOURNAL is one of the palpable 
results of the recent thirtieth annual convention of the 
British Library Association at Glasgow. Some time 
before that event, the Board of Education had sent 
out a circular to the public libraries of the kingdom, 
urging their cooperation with the National Home 
Reading Union in furthering the interests common to 
both. The outcome of this and subsequent agitation 
and discussion has now appeared in the shape of an invit- 
ing monthly magazine called " The Readers' Review," 
which will treat not only of matters pertaining espe- 
cially to the Union, but also of such themes as the 
libraries subscribing to it shall choose to bring forward 
for discussion; and it will thus serve as the official 
organ of the local library at the same time that it 
stands for the larger interests of the Home Reading 
Union and of public libraries throughout the land. The 
Union undertakes to provide sixteen pages of literary 
matter and important news items, and the Library Asso- 
ciation is invited to nominate an editorial committee as 
its own representative — or perhaps to take entire charge 
of the editorship. This point is not quite clear to us. 
Book-lists and local advertisements are spoken of as to 
be forthcoming from the various subscribing libraries, 
and these libraries may either sell or distribute gratui- 
tously the copies for which they subscribe. The saving 
in printing expenses to the several libraries by this coop- 
erative action, and the gain expected from advertise- 
ments, will more than pay for the copies of the period-

that the scheme has already met with favor from some

schemes they are a long lead ahead of us.

Public library borrowers of fiction are much 
fewer in proportion to the whole number of public- 
library patrons, than au unthinking reader of circulation 
statistics would infer. For example, the Grand Rapids 
Public Library mmibers about 15,000 card-holders; but 
in the past year, as has been ascertained, only 3890 of 
these persons drew fiction, while of this number 1050, 
or barely seven per cent of the library's patrons, drew 
more than sixty per cent of all the novels drawii, and 
152 drew sixteen per cent. Therefore the familiar re- 
port that two-thirds, or three-quarters, or four-flfths, of 
a library's total circulatioi; has been fiction, need not 
induce gloomy apprehensions of a softening of the public 
brain. Probably not more than a quarter of the card- 
holders—and those largely in the sentimental stage of 
their adolescence — are readers of novels only. In- 
deed, it is probable that not -so many as one-quarter 
read nothing more serious than story-books from Jan- 
uary to December; and even readers of innumerable 
novels may actually spend more time over a few serious 
books than over fiction in the course of the year. Ten 
historical or scientific works might easily demand more 
hours of reading and study than a hundred novels of the 
day. The latter are often run through at odd moments 
as a " rest cure," after strenuous intellectual labors. 
Furthermore, hundreds and thousands of novels are 
taken from the library and returned imread or but partly 
read. A chapter, a page, a turning of the leaves per- 
haps, or a glance at the end, may convince the borrower 
that the book has no meat for him, and back it goes. 
While, then, signs of serious-mindedness are always to 
be welcomed m public-library patrons, there is no cause 
for despair in statistical evidences of even a greatly 
disproportionate borrowing of fiction.

The status of the librarian as the representa- 
tive of a learned profession was commented upon by 
Mr. Carnegie in his speech at the recent laying of the 
comer-stone of a new library building in Glasgow. He 
deplored especially the low estimation in which librarians 
are held in Great Britain, and urged a more generous 
recognition of their services. These words of the Laird 
of Skibo the Secretary of the Library Assistants' Associa- 
tion regards asalmost equivalent to insult added to injury. 
" From Mr. Carnegie,"he says in the Association's official 
journal, " such remarks are simply amusing, seeing that 
by building bookless, incomeless libraries, he has done 
more than any man to bring ill-equipped men into the 
profession. A Carnegie provincial library that cannot 
afford books cannot afford to pay a professional libra- 
rian, and the man appointed is simply another unfit 
recruit. The satire of Mr. Carnegie's is even more 
biting when he compares the superior technical training 
of the American librarian with ours, seeing that he has 
never lifted a fmger in this country for the education of 
the librarian." Without heartily applauding the cen- 
sorious tone of this utterance, one may appropriately 
enough urge that the admitted zeal and unselfishness 
of library workers deserve more handsome recognition, 
in terms of dollars and cents, both from the private 



benefactor and from the public treasury. Librarian- 
ships, like professorships, might well be endowed. This 
by way of suggestion to any man of millions who is 
haunted with the fear of dying disgracefully rich.

The disadvantages of UNIVERSALCULTURE,granted 
the possibility of the whole world's ever attaining to what 
we here and now regard as culture, must have suggested 
themselves to many an idle muser As a man thinks, 
so is he. A world in which all nations and races cher- 
ished the same ideals and thought the same thoughts 
would be insufferably monotonous. For one thing, would 
not all men come to look alike? Even as it is, with the 
spread of international communication and the inter- 
change of Eastern and Western ideas, national types 
are said to be disappearing, and all mankind is assunmig, 
or in danger of assumuig, a dreary sameness of linea- 
ment and expression. A German artist who makes a 
speciality of studying the lines and features of the hu- 
man face declares that we are all getting to be as like 
as peas in a pod. The final result will be the composite 
human being, like the composite photog^ph; and the 
standardized face, like the standardized railway, the 
standardized flour-barrel, or (terrible thought ) the stand- 
ardized spelling. Already this student of physiognomy 
finds the same characteristics in Irishmen as in American 
Indians, and in the Esquimaux as in the Japanese. 
However, this retrogi'ade movement from complexity 
and differentiation and specialization back to primal 
uniformity and sameness will not go very far in our day 
and generation. One can comfortingly say to oneself, 
as one does in estimating the probable duration of the 
sun's heat, " The world will last out my time, any way."

The Columbia craze for spelling-reform reached 
its climax in the late formal acceptance by the Board 
of Trustees, in council assembled, of one hundred and 
eighty " reformed " words. These redeemed repro- 
bates, having been brought to see the error of their 
ways, having put off the old man, which is unphonetic, 
and put on the new, which is created in the office of the 
Spelling-Reform Association, are henceforth admitted 
to good and regular standing in the Columbia vocabu- 
larj-. But no puuishmeut — neither suspension nor expul- 
sion, nor even so much as a censure — will be inilicted 
on those students who still prefer the unregenerate 
spelling. The list invites a few comments. Shorter 
and simpler than a catalogue of words in -or would have 
been an enumeration of those in -our, if any such are 
to be sanctioned. If gipsy, then why not Egi/itian, since 
the two are etymologically the same ? But perhaps 
the omission is due to the latter's being a proper noun. 
Whisky is perhaps a logical concession to the now general 
practice of writing whiskies in the plural. Rime for 
rhyme makes one shudder. Doubtless there are in the 
list many spellings that, even without Cohmibia's sanc- 
tion, the world would in time have learned to endure, 
to pity, and finally to embrace; but the world dislikes 
to be asked to hasten in such matters.

The books of Leslie Stephen must have formed 
an interesting collection after their owner had finished 
using them. Critical comments, pithy and pimgent, 
adorned their margins, and he never hesitated, when 
occasion required, to tear the heart out of a volume in 
more senses than one. Some of the best reading in 
Maitland's life of Stephen has to do with the treatment 
accorded to his library by this no-respecter of books.

H.*.RD TIMES ANT) THE BOOK TR.VDE afford material 
for some interesting speculations. The belief is held 
by competent obseJ-vers that the sale of books is but 
little affected by a period of financial stringency. Some 
even contend that at Christmas time the sale of books 
is stimulated at the expense of more costly gifts. The 
purchaser who would need ten or twenty or fifty dollars 
for a suitable gift at a jewelry store, finds that for two 
or three or five dollars wisely expended at a book store 
he can procure a gift always acceptable and in good 
taste. The "Publisher's Weekly" says on this point : 
"The strength of the book trade is in the fact that it 
is midway between the necessaries and the luxuries. 
The richer classes will not buy expensive jewelry, and 
their Christmas purchases are the more likely to be of 
books. This will be true also of the great middle class, 
people who find in books a convenient and inexpensive 
present. Publishers and booksellers," the " Weekly " 
wisely concludes, " will continue to do well with really 
good books." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



BROWNING'S NARRATIVE VERSE. 
(To the Editor of The Dlvl.) 
In his survey of English narrative poetry, published 
in your issue of November 16, Mr. Charles Leonard 
Moore repeats a criticism of Browning that has been 
heard frequently before — that the monologue, his most ' 
characteristic form of art, is thoroughly unnatural. One 
may heartily agree with what Mr. Moore goes on to say, ! 
that a soliloquy may easily be overdone; Browning him- j 



self overdid it, for example in "The Return of the 
Druses," act ii, scene i, in which Djabal leads off with 
a long soliloquy and follows it up with five " asides " 
before he and KhalU begin to converse together — to 
say nothing of the asides in which Djabal and Anael 
indulge later in the scene. But with Browning's master- 
piece the case is different. If Mr. Moore will take 
down " The Ring and the Book " once more, he will 
find, I think, that it contains just three solUoquies — the 
remarks of the two lawyers and of the Pope. In the 
first and the last poem Browning speaks in his capacity 
of editor and interpreter; all the other speakers address 
one or more persons and cannot therefore be said to 
soliloquize. With regard to the artistic merits of mon- 
ologues of this kind, I do not see how speaking that is 
intended to be heard is less artistic than writing that is 
intended to be read. And to say that one must not 
speak beyond a certain length of time is a good deal 
like saying that a sunset may be crimson to a certain 
degree, but not more so; it is to utter the most baneful 
kind of criticism that literature has to encounter. 

But how about the soliloquies of the lawyers, the 
Pope, and, for that matter, of any and all of Browning's 
poems? Here again Mr. Moore is right if one accepts 
his premises. A soliloquy talk no compdling came is 
doubtless unnatural; though it were rash, perhaps, to 
say the most foolish of all the many follies of literature. 
But does Browning lack the compelling cause? De 
Archangelis is writing his speech in defense of Guido. 
Surely there can be no artistic sin in projecting his 
thoughts upon paper — even to the extent of aU the 
thoughts that come to him until the speech is pigeon- 
holed and he goes off to play with Cinoncello. Similarly, 
Bottinius reads his finished speech, with brief com- 
ments; what can be more natural or lifelike? The 
Pope speaks 212S lines, it is tme, — a little more than 
the number in "Macbeth"; but surely there is a com- 
pelling cause for his prolonged deliberation, — it is not 
merely Guide's life, worthless as that appears, not merely 
his own eternal welfare, it is the triumph of justice over 
injustice, of righteousness over the subtle forces of hell. 
As the arbiter of this strife, the Pope may well pause. 
That his utterance should be a soliloquy, is in the nature 
of things inevitable; a powerful situation could hardly 
be devised that would provide him with an interlocutor. 

I am not pleading with Mr. Moore for the inclusion of 
any part of " The Ring and the Book " in his proposed 
anthology — which may we have soon; but he might do 
worse than print therein " Caponsacchi " and " Pompilia," 
the stories of two of the most impressive cliaracters of 
the world's fiction. Clakk S. Northup.

TEN'NTSON-S " THE PASSING OF ARTHUR.' 
(To the Editor of Thi Dial.) 

If we are to have an anthology of English narrative 
verse, might it not be better to include in it "Ten- 
nyson's " The Passing of Arthur "' in preference to the 
poet's cruder earlier form " Morte D'Arthur," as recom- 
mended by Mr. Charles L. Moore in your current issue? 

The rules that govern the making of an anthology 
must of necessity be based on personal preferences. 
But the selection of an experiment in preference to a 
completed form seems to me so peculiar that for a mo- 
ment one is tempted to think it possible that the writer 
confused the " Morte D'Arthur " with " The Passing of 
Arthur." O. R. Howard Thohsox.

QuEEK Victoria as Letter- Writer.* 

The long-awaited Letters of Queen Victoria, 
edited by Mr. A. C. Benson and Viscount Esher, 
have at last appeared in three generous octavos, 
not far from two thousand pages ; and yet the 
correspondence extends only to the beginning of 
the year 1862, and is, so the editors intimate, 
a mere sifting of the whole mass of available 
material. If a sieve with even finer meshes had 
been used, and a good third or half of the actu- 
ally published letters kept back, we should still 
have been served with no scant measure. In- 
deed, for purposes of honest reading (not skim- 
ming) and hearty enjoyment, it is not impossi- 
ble that if these letters had been, like the 
Sibylline Books, diminished by two-thirds, the 
remaining third would, like them, have been 
worth as much as the whole. Communications 
of a merely formal nature, and those that, like 
many to the writer's " dearly beloved Uncle " 
(King Leopold of Belgium), contain nothing 
but pretty out-gushings of affection, are so little 
varied or original in conception and expression, 
that a very few might fairly answer as repre- 
sentative of all. There are enough that are 
important, as illustrative either of current his- 
tory or of personal character, without including 
those of lesser interest. For the letters, merely 
as examples of epistolary literature, are in no 
way remarkable ; their writer was far from being 
a Madame de Sevigne. 

The monotony is pleasantly relieved by the 
insertion of many letters to the Queen,by extracts 
from other contemporary documents, and by an 
occasional passage from her majesty's diary. 
Moreover, the care and skill shown in editing 
and annotating this great quantity of miscel- 
laneous matter are all that could be desired. 
Besides the editors, several other men of letters, 
expert in various departments of learning and 
literature, have taken part in the preparation 
of these volumes. Mr. John Morley " has read 
and criticised the book in its final form"; Lord 
KnoUys has aided in the selection of material ; 
Mr. J. W. Headlam has helped in preparing 
the brief and excellent historical summaries that 
introduce the several chapters; Dr. Eugene 
Oswald has done good work in translating; 

*The Letters op Queen Victoria. A selection from Her 
Majesty's Correspondence between the years 1837 and 1861. Pub-

In three volumes. Illustrated. New York : Ix)nginans, Green, 
& Co. 



and others have rendered service of different 
kinds. A word, now, from the editors as to the 
general plan of the whole work. 

"His Majesty, the King, having decided that no 
attempt should he made to puhlish these papers in extenso, 
it was necessary to determine upon some definite prin- 
ciple of selection. It became clear that the only satis- 
factory plan was to publish specimens of such docu- 
ments as would serve to bring out the development of 
the Queen's character and disposition, and to give typical 
instances of her methods in deallug with political and 
social matters — to produce, in fact, a book for British 
citizens and British subjects, rather than a book for 
students of political history. That the inner workings 
of the imwritten constitution of the country, that some 
of the unrealized checks and balances, that the delicate 
equipoise of the component parts of our executive 
macliinery, should stand revealed, was inevitable." 

It was thought the less desirable to make the 
work a detailed history of the years 1837-61 
" as Sir Theodore Martin, under the auspices of 
the Queen herself, has dealt so minutely and 
exhaustively with the relations of the Queen's 
innermost circle to the political and social life 
of the time." A few extracts, to exhibit if 
possible in so brief a space the Queen's character 
in process of development, and to give an idea 
of " her methods in dealing with jjolitical and 
social matters," may now be fitly introduced. 
The letters really begin nine years before the 
assigned date, the earliest one having been 
written in 1828. It is the first of a long series 
to Prince, and afterward King, Leopold, brother 
to the Duchess of Kent. As girlishly human as 
that of any little nine-year-old Miss to a fond 
uncle, it offers the strongest possible contrast to 
the great mass of later letters, so many of which 
are formal and official and written by a secre- 
tary's hand. 

" My dearest Uncle, — I wish you many happy 
returns of your birthday; I very often think of you, 
and I hope to see you soon again, for I am very fond 
of you. I see my Aunt Sopliia often, who looks very 
well, and is very well. I use every day your pretty 
soup-basin. Is it very warm in Italy ? It is so mild 
here, that I go out every day. Mama is tolerable well 
and [I] am quite well. Your affectionate niece, 

Victoria. 

" P. S. — I am very angry with you. Uncle, for you 
have never written to me once since you went, and that 
is a long while." 

Another letter, six years later, to the same 
beloved uncle, shows the writer deep in history, 
ancient and modem. It was certainly no ordin- 
ary mind that coidd, at her age, understand and 
enjoy the works in which she declares herself so 
deeply interested. Shorn of introductory and 
concluding amenities, the letter reads as follows : 

" As I have not got Sully's Memoirs, I shall be 
delighted if you will be so good as to give them to me. 



1907.] 



THE DIAL 



369 



Reading history is one of my greatest delights, and per- 
haps, dear Uncle, you might like to know which books in 
that line I am now reading. In my lessons with the 
Dean of Chester, I am reading Russell's Modem Ewrvpe, 
which is very interesting, and Clarendon's History of the 
Bebellion. It is drily written, but is full of instmcticm. 
I like reading different authors, of different opinions, by 
which means I learn not to lean on one particular side. 
Besides my lessons, I read Jones' account of the wars in 
Spain, Portugal, and the South of France, from the year 
180S till 1814. It is well done, I think, and amoses 
me very much. In French I am now in La Rwaliti de 
la France et de I 'Efpagne, par Gaillard, which is very 
interesting. I have also begun Rollin. I am very fmd 
of malring tables of the Kings and Queens, as I go on, 
and I have lately finished one of the English Sovereigns 
and their consorts, as, of course, the history of my own 
country is one of my first duties." 

The courting and the espousal of the young 
Queen receive due mention in the correspondence 
of early 1840, but the editors have permitted 
no desecration of the innermost sanctuary of the 
heart. In a letter written on the day following 
her marriage, the happy bride exclaims, with 
lavish use of italics and capitals, and splendid 
disregard of grammar and syntax : '• I write to 
you from here [Windsor Castle] , the happiest, 
happiest Being that ever existed. Really, I do 
not think it possible for anyone in the world to 
be happier, or as happy as I am. He is an 
Angel, and his kindness and affection for me is 
really touching. To look in those dear eyes, and 
that dear stmny face, is enough to make me adore 
him. ^NTiat I can do to make him happy will 
be my greatest delight." 

Passing now to the revolutionary disturbances 
of 1848, we quote from a birthday letter writ- 
ten to Lord Melbourne on the l-Sth of ilarch. 

" Lord Melbourne will agree with the Queen that the 
last three weeks have brought back the times of the last 
century, and we are in the midst of troubles abroad. 
The Revolution in France is a sad and alarming thing. 
. . . The poor King and his Government made many 
mistakes within the last two years, and were obstinate 
and totally blind at the last till flight was inevitable. 
But for six:een years he did a great deal to maintyin 
peace, and made France prosperous, which shonld not be 
forgotten. . . . Lord Melbourne's kind heart will grieve 
to think of the real want the poor King and Queen 
are in, their diimer-table containing barely enough to 
eat. . . . Surely the poor old King is sufficiently 
puni^ed for his faults." 

Reference is also made to the discontent in Ger- 
many, but the writer feels assured that "the 
good Germans are at bottom very loyal." She 
also gives thanks that Belgium is not involved 
in the prevailing disturbances. 

Among the many statesmanlike letters and 
messages of the Queen, a eommimication to Lord 
Clarendon, Foreign Secretary, written on the 
eve of the outbreak of the Crimean War, will 



serve as an illustration of her clear-headedness 
and sagacity. We quote a few sentences, but 
cannot feel sure how far they are the unprompted 
expression of her own mind. 

" As matters have now been arranged, it spears to 
the Queen, moreover, that we have taken on ourselves 
in conjunction with France all the risks of a European 
war without having bound Turkey to any conditions with 
respect to provoking it. The hundred and twenty 
fanatieal Turks constituting the Divan at Constantinople 
are left sole judges of the line of policy to be pursued, 
and made cognisant at the same time of the fact that 
England and France have bound themselves to defend 
the Turkish Territory! This is entrusting them with 
a power which Parliament has been jealous to confide 
even to the hands of the British Crown. It may be a 
question whether Elngland ought to go to war for the 
defense of so-called Turkish Independence; but there 
can be none that if she does so, she ought to be the sole 
judge of what constitutes a breach of that independence, 
and have the fullest power to prevent by negotiation the 
breaking ont of the war." 

A visit of the Emperor Napoleon III. to 
England, in 1856, moved his royal hostess to 
certain reflections on the strangely contradictory 
qualities of his character. From a five-page 
" memorandum *' in which the Queen attempts 
to analyze that character, a few words may be 
quoted. The paper begins with comments on 
the remarkable combination of circimistances 
that had brought England and her ancient foe 
and rival, France, into close alliance, and had 
made it possible for the nephew of the hated 
Corsican to set foot on British soil as a friendly 
visiting monarch. The writer's sex would not 
be hard to guess, did we not already know it. 

"That he t,< a very extraordinary man, with great 
qualities, there can be no doubt — I might almost say a 
mysterious man. He is evidently possessed of indomit- 
abk courage, mtfiatdung jbrmmea »f pnarpote, ndf-rdiaitee, 
peneeenatee, and great teorecy; to this should be added, 
a great rdiance oa what he calls his Star, and a belief 
in omens and incidents as eonnected with his future 
destiny, which is almost romantic — and at the same 
time he is endowed with wonderful tdf-contrai, great 
calmness, even gendenesf, and with » power otfiuematioH, 
the effect of which upon all those iriw beeome more 
intimately acquainted with him is wnml senri&fy felt." 

And so on, with a use of italics that seems almost 
frantic. She thinks him more German than 
French in disposition, astonishingly tactful and 
versed in public affairs for one reared in com- 
parative obscurity, and in one sense irresponsible 
for his acts of cruelty and wrong, because he be- 
lieves himself the passive instrument of a heaven- 
appointed destiny. The whole document forms 
one of the most curious items in the whole book. 
The two qiudities most typical of English 
middle-class character, as the editors point out, 
are common-sense and fomily affection; and 
these qualities the Queen possessed in generous

The distinguished achievement of Mr. Tim- 
othy Cole as a wood-engraver has been more 
than once noticed in these columns. Continuing 
the monumental series of reproductions of paint- 
ings by the old masters, begun many years ago 
with " Old Italian Masters," and followed at 
considerable intervals by " Old Dutch and Flem- 
ish Masters " and " Old English Masters," he 
now presents us with a volume on " Old Span- 
ish Masters." The thirty-one examples of his 
work contained in it add fresh lustre to his fame. 
Though not all of equal excellence, they are as 
beautiful artistically as anything he has previ- 
ously done, and some of them are quite unsur- 
passed. Mr. Cole's skill with the graver shows 
no sign of diminution. His line is stiU as mar- 
vellously varied, as virile and sympathetically 
expressive, as ever. There is, too, the same cer- 
tainty of handling and feeling for tactile values 
— to quote Mr. Berenson's phrase, — the same 
combination of strength and refinement, that 
have marked his finest performance in the past. 
Wood-cuts have been so almost entirely su- 
perseded by photo-mechanical engravings that it 
seems worth while to set forth here the points 
wherein each is superior to the other. The 
greater fidelity of the mechanical process is in- 
contestable, and in spite of more or less inevitable 
distortion of tone values and the general deaden- 
ing of the whole effect, the result yields a far 
better basis for forming an opinion of the orig- 
inal than any hand-wrought engraving can give. 
If, however, a wood-engraving leaves something 
out of the reproduction, it affords a much richer 
quality of tone and preserves more of the atmo- 
sphere — the enveloppe, as the French woidd 
say. To put it in another way, the mechanical 
reproduction is soulless even when authentic, 
while the wood-cut m ay retain the vitality of the

original though something is perforce left out. 
A comparison of Mr. Cole's engraving of " The 
Spinners " by Velasquez with a goo<l photo- 
engraving of the picture will show clearly 
what is meant by the foregoing. In almost any 
of the surfaces, — as, for instance, that of the 
gown of the woman lifting the curtain, or that 
of the wall at the right of the alcove, — it will 
be found that the engraver has not fuUy brought 
out all of the subtle modulations and broken color 
of the painting. The wood-cut does, however, 
give a sense of the way in which brilliant rays 
of light and pulsing shadows play through the 
room, and there is a mellowness and softness of 
tone that the mechanical engraving cannot ap- 
proach. 

Within the limitations imposed by the nature 
of his art, Mr. Cole has wrought wonders ; but 
to appreciate his engravings at their fuU value 
they should be considered not as reproductions, 
but as interpretations in another medium. 
Viewed in this way, we may best enjoy their 
very great beauty in and for itself, and may get 
from them something we must almost certainly 
miss if we endeavor to translate them back into 
the medium from which they were copied. Take, 
for example, the superb engraving of " The 
Menippus " by Velasquez. Wherever the eye 
may play over it, its texture is entrancing. 
Whether or not it is faithful to the smallest de- 
tail is unimportant. Faithful it is, in a large 
sense ; but apart from that, it is a work of art in 
itseK, and the fact that it is based upon another 
work of art is, or should be, a minor considera^ 
tion. 

Similar delight is afforded by each of the en- 
gravings in this volume, though not always in 
the same degree. Those from the portrait of 
El Greco by himself, and the " Head of a Young 
Man" by Velasquez, are veritable triumphs; 
and a number of others — as Murillo's " Im- 
macidate Conception " and his " St. John the 
Baptist," Morales's " Madonna and Child," and 
El Greco's " Coronation of the Virgin " — are 
only a little less noteworthy. In some instances 
Mr. Cole has not been quite so happy in his 
rendering, as in the "Portrait of King Philip 
IV. as a Sportsman " by Velasquez, where the 
treatment of the tree leaves something to be de- 
sired; in the "Madonna of the Little Bird" by 
Morales, where the motion in the lines used for 
the drapery in the background is not quite pleas- 
ant; and in " The Adoration of the Shepherds" 
by Murillo, where again the lines used in en- 
graving the figure of the shepherd in the fore- 
ground may be thought a bit too insistent. But

faultfinding is ever an ungrateful task; these 
comparisons should be understood as being 
made with Mr. Cole's work at its best, and at 
his best he is a master without a rival. 

Without having knowledge of all the cir- 
cumstances that governed jVIi'. Cole in making 
his choice of the paintings reproduced, criticism 
of the selection would be imfair. Were they 
to be estimated solely for the artistic value of 
the originals, it woidd be difficult to justify the 
inclusion of as many works b}* Murillo as by 
Velasquez. In the accompanj-ing text Mr. 
Caffin champions the cause of Murillo and finds 
comparison between him and Valasquez " unjust 
and profitless." It is the '• intrinsic human- 
ness " of the works of the Se\-illian painter that 
appeals to him more especially. Their trivial- 
ity and lack of intellectual force do not seem 
to count with him, which is the more surprising 
as what he has to say about Vela.squez is very 
gootl indeed, and as he is careful to point out' 
that his paintings, in spite of their natiiralism, 
owe much of their distinction to '• the decorative 
quality of the compositions." As this quality — 
the harmonic arrangement of line, mass, and 
tones — is fundamental, it furnishes a criterion 
for all works of art ; yet of its application to 
these by MurUlo, Mr. Caffin has naught to say. 
In the main, however, his text is excellent, and 
should not be overlooked by those who buy the 
book for the sake of the engra\4ngs.

Some Pleasaxt Books of Travel.* 

Books of travel probably appeal to more 
varied types of mind than any other books in lit- 
erature. High ]>oetry is for the few, philosophy 
for the elect, fiction (the kind that Thackeray 
wrote or Meredith expounds) for the cultured, 
sociology for the studious ; but books of travel 
are the favorites of old and yoimg, grave and 
gay, cidturetl and unciUtured readers. Travel- 
lers' tales appeal to the youth blest with the spirit 
of the wandering foot, and to the fireside philos- 
opher whose journeys end lies beyond in the un- 
discovered country. Boys delight in those tales 
of which Othello speaks, — " of most disastrous

chances, of moving accidents by flood and field "; 
and the slippered philosopher, too, delights in 
such tales " of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the im- 
minent deadly breach." The very sound of such 
enchanted words as " The Gold Coast," " The 
Spanish Alain," " The Frozen North," " Darkest 
Africa," and " The Southern Cross " stir the 
imagination. The spirit of the wanderlust is 
an abiding one, though the world grows smaller 
and the volume of books describing it grows 
ever larger. 

No recent book on Africa more strikingly 
confirms Sir Richard Burton's saying, " Bx 
Africa aliquid semper novi" than the books of 
Herr C. G. Schillings, the German animal 
photographer and naturalist. Out of Africa 
Herr Schillings has brought the most wonderfid 
and most intimate pictures of wild animals 
we have ever seen. " In Wildest Africa," the 
naturalist-photographer's latest work, is a stout 
volume of over seven hundred pages, with over 
three hundred photographic studies direct from 
the author's negatives. It brings the lives of 
African birds and beasts before us with almost 
startling accuracy. At first view, these pictures 
are likely to be disappointing ; they lack that 
sharpness and distinctness of outline which we 
associate with ordinarj' photography. But as 
one grows familiar with them they take on a 
new aspect, that of impressionistic art. On 
this particular point, Herr Schillings says : 

"Considering the extreme difficulty of taking por- 
traits of living animals in their wild, timid state, such 
pictures can only in a few instances lay claim to tech- 
nical perfeeticm. But so far as my taste goes, a certain 
lack of sharp definition in the picture ... is not only 
no disadvantage, but is even desirable." 

The author writes further on this subject : 

" It must be noted tliat if the animals are drawn so 
as to stand out separated from the landscape which is a 
needful accessory of the picture, and brought forward 
into the foregroimd in an obviously selected pose, they 
must appear umiatural to the eye of the expert. Such 
pictures cannot fail to give an unnatural impression, for 
in the freedom of the wilderness the animal would never 
present itself in this way to the eyes of man. ... It 
has been a keen satisfaction to me to find that many 
world-renowned artists have appreciated warmly the 
beauty of these photographs, and have given expression 
to this feeling. I have been told, for instance, — what 
I myself had already noticed, - — that many of the pic- 
tures, especially those showing birds on the wing, bear 
a great resemblance to certain famous works of Japanese 
painters of animal life, works that seem to dive into the 
secrets of nature." 

Bearing these words in mind, we can ^new a 
photogi-aph of a herd of antelopes, a troop of 
gazelles, giraffes, or zebras, or it may be a flock 
of cranes or storks, and understand how they and

their environment are one ; their bodies and their 
very actions sha<ling into the hazy atmosphere 
of their native wilds, or melting away into in- 
definite outlines in the shimmering light of the 
African veldt or jungle. As a matter of fact, 
there is a wide divergence between title and text 
in this volume : the larger part of the text deals 
with matter entirely foreign to the title. After 
an introductory chapter treating the changes in 
Africa dui'ing the past decade, the author writes 
on such diverse topics as the development of ani- 
mal portraiture, the disappearance of African 
wUd game, and then — of all topics ! — " Sport 
and Nature in Germany." This foreign matter 
is followed by chapters relating to the real sub- 
ject of the volume, the most interesting one be- 
ing "The Capturing of a Lion "; and the book 
closes with two more chapters on photography 
and its possibilities as helps to the study of 
wild-life. 

Mr. F. A. McKenzie, an Englishman, in his 
volume entitled " The Unveiled East," depicts 
Japan as a menace to the trade and prestige of 
Great Britain in that region. The opening 
words of the book tell the reader what the 
uplifted veil reveals. 

" By the extension and maintenance of territorial 
supremacy outside her own borders, by securing exclu- 
sive trading privileges, by a wholesale system of mono- 
polies, subsidies, bounties, and concessions, and by the 
skilful use of her limited tariff autonomy, Japan has 
entered fully upon a campaign of aggressive imperial- 
ism. . . . Entering Korea under the guise of friend- 
ship and alliance, her representatives have absorbed 
the govermnent, made the Emperor virtually a pris- 
oner, forced the British chief of the Custom Service 
from office, acquired many concessions, and seized the 
lands and homes of the common people in town and 
country." 

Manchuria too, the author asserts, will soon 
be under the rule of Tokyo, and the integrity 
of China is threatened with the grasping hand 
of the wUy Japanese. National pride and 
economic necessity are driving the Japanese 
onward, and it is time, so Mr. McKenzie thinks, 
to treat them, " not as children, not as serai- 
angels, but as a great, ambitious, and strong- 
purposed nation." Such is the drift of Mr. 
McKenzie's book; but we do not wish to con- 
vey the idea through our quotations that the 
author is a Jeremiah. Quite to the contrary, 
his book is well-balanced and reserved in opinion 
and in fact, and makes interesting and profita- 
ble reading for anyone concerned in Far Eastern 
affairs. Besides his thorough discussion of 
commercial and diplomatic affairs in China and 
Japan, the author has entertaining chapters on 
the new Chinese army, the " new woman " in 



China, and the great missionary question. On 
the last topic, Mr. McKenzie says : 

"The day of the foreign missionary of the old type 
in Japan is over. The missionary work there to-morrow 
will rather be done by the occasional visits of expert 
foreign evangelists and by the literary and intellectual 
efforts of a few highly trained teachers, than along 
present lines." 

England's opportunity in the vital issues soon 
to be sifted in the Far East lies in her being the 
friend and protector of China; and, concludes 
the author, "English and American interests 
in the Far East are identical." 

No book on our present list is more worthy 
of extended consideration that the one bearing 
the title " The Near East." Although the volume 
is published anonymously, every page reveals 
the author as one who investigates his subject 
thoroughly, discriminates his information care- 
fully, and writes convincingly. Moreover he 
apparently had easy access to the powers that 
'rule in Montenegro, Bosnia, Servia, Bulgaria, 
Roumania, and Turkey. He sipped coffee, 
smoked cigarettes, and talked with the " various 
kings and princes of the Balkan states," the 
Sidtan of Turkey, and nearly all the members 
of the various cabinets, as well as with people 
of the middle class and with peasants, in order 
to form some conclusion as to the real situa- 
tion — political, economical, social, and finan- 
cial — in this European hotbed of discord. He 
found Montenegro the most interesting country 
in all the Balkans. Prince Nicholas, its i-ider, 
told the author that the solution of the Balkan 
difficulty lies in placing Macedonia under a 
governor-general who must be a European 
prince. Against the advice of his London 
friends and contrary to the strong opposition of 
Prince Nicholas, and, moreover, in spite of the 
fact that the insurance companies declined to 
accept the risk of accident, the author went to 
the Accursed Mountains in Northern Albania — 
a country hitherto practically a sealed book, for 
there are no printed accounts of actual travel 
there, nothing even in the journals of the Koyal 
Geographical Society. The Accursed Mountains 
are inhabited by brigandish tribes — the " real 
thing " out of the story-book — who hold life 
cheap. They come down from the mountains 
in armed bands, and walk through the town, a 
dozen or so together, in complete defiance of 
the Turks. After much trouble, the author 
enjoyed the unique pleasure of being the guest 
of Vatt Marashi, chief of the Skeli, the strongest 
and most feared of the mountain bands. This 
story-book brigand spoke significantly of the 
revolt of the Albanians from the Turk.

" The revolt will come one day ere long — when we 
are ready. We can, however, afford to wait at pres- 
ent. Turkey will soon have her hands full with Bul- 
garia and Macedonia, and then — well, we shall help 
Bulgaria, and in a week there won't be a Turk in 
Skodra." 

In Bosnia, the writer found the clever, subtle, 
evil hand of Austria working in Machiavellian 
style — one of extermination and extension. 
When writing on the subject of Austria and Ger- 
many in the Balkans, the writer is so intensely 
in earnest that the reader holds his breath at 
the audacious charges made against those na- 
tions. But his very earnestness is proof of his 
own assertion that his purpose is not " to scream 
hysterical condemnations." One of the most 
astonishing features in this rather remarkable 
book is the author's commendation of King Peter 
of Servia. The world has come to think, rightly 
or wrongly, that King Peter is sadly out of place 
as a ruler in this highly sensitizetl region. In all 
circles of society, the author tells us, the King 
is recognized as a model father, as a wise ruler 
who leaves j>olitics to his ministers, and as a man 
who concerns himseK with the more humble 
duties of advancing the cause of sanitation, 
agriculture, and religion. Surely a new picture 
of King Peter I In regard to the ever-present 
quarrel between the Bidgar and the Turk, the 
author is clear that " Bulgaria has right on her 
side, and in the name of humanity it is the duty 
of the Powers to support her." The Turks, at 
least those in high place, regard their govern- 
ment of Macedonia with complacent equanimity, 
denjnng that they aid and abet the Greek bands 
in massacring the Christians, and viewing the 
possibilities of war with Bidgaria with perfect 
tranquillity. This tranquillity and equanimity, 
asserts our author, doubtless arise from the re- 
liance of Turkey on Germany. All Turks are 
fascinated by the benign smile of Germany ; they 
are mystified as to what Austria will do in event 
of war, and they are given to treating Great 
Britain with studied politeness. In conclusion, 
the author predicts war in that country within a 
few months. An excellent map, manj' choice 
illustrations made from photographs by the au- 
thor and by Princess Xenia of Montenegro, and 
a gootl table of contents, make the volume a 
pleasing one. 

Mr. F. G. Aflalo, an Englishman, came to 
our country on two ambitious quests : first, to 
meet the President, and, secondly, to catch tar- 
pon on the Florida coast. Both ambitions were 
happily attained. Such hospitality and such 
good luck should have inclined the author to a 
more considerate valuation of the land which 



gave him such good entertainment. But not- 
withstanding his plea of candor, Mr. Aflalo, in 
his volume entitled " Sunshine and Sport in 
Florida and the West Indies," amuses himself 
by giving some hard raps to us and our institu- 
tions. In the first part of his book, " The 
Way There " (meaning his trip to New York, to 
Washington, and the South), the author takes 
a shy at our cigars, children, coffee, food, tea, 
men and women, and our idea of liberty. " I 
venture to suggest that there is in one hour in 
London more personal liberty than in a year of 
New York." This last statement, we gather, 
arises from an incident in a New York street- 
car in which a large and overheated bricklayer 
sat on the author's knees without as much as 
" by your leave." The South, in Mr. Aflalo's 
opinion, is to be pitied for the paralyzing influ- 
ence of the negro question. The author s view 
of the race problem is revealed thus : " I wish 
that some of the poor negro's advocates could 
know the sensation of being hustled off a side- 
walk by a buck nigger in the full flush of 
emancipation. ' There are, to be sure, many 
words of praise for us and our institutions, — 
the zoological collection and the aquarium in 
New York, the beauty of Washington, and the 
scenery of North Carolina around Asheville ; 
but on the whole, the view is warped and per- 
verted. Had Mr. Aflalo gathered his impressions 
at greater leisure, and generalized less from 
trivial instances, he woidd have informed his 
volume with the more genial spirit which we 
associate with the men who go a-fishing. For 
we can find no fault with Mr. Aflalo's story of 
his tarpon fishing. He writes on that subject 
with such zest and good-humor that we too can 
fish with him from our arm-chair. All that 
j pertains to tarpon catching, from the cost of the 
tackle to landing the game, is interestingly 
recounted in the book. In eleven days the 
author caught seventeen tarpon, most of them 
on the afternoon of the last day. As a matter 
of mere sport, however. Mi*. Aflalo does not 
rank tarpon fishing very high. If one's tackle 
holds, one is likely to land one's catch — imless, 
as often occurs, a shark takes a hand in the 
sport, a tip breaks, or the fish is foid-hooked. 
With less jx)werfid tackle, so the author con- 
tends, the sport would be increased, as more 
skill would be required. But sometimes, as 
happened to the \vriter of this book, the heavy 
tackle which makes tarpon fishing a cometly 
makes a ti-agedy in the play of fishing, as when 
a shark takes the bait. Mr. Aflalo suffered 
the unpleasant sensation of being towed for over

made ordinary fishing seem commonplace. 

Mr. Alexander Macdonald, the author of " In 
Search of El Dorado," is one of those venture- 
some spirits of our day whose exploits challenge 
comparison with the deeds of soldiers of fortune 
of earlier times. He has wandered over much 
of the world in search of gold, opals, and pearls, 
and his book recomits his adventures in such 
remotely related lands as the Ivlondike, the 
back-blocks and the Never-Never Land of Aus- 
tralia, and British New Guinea. Nature, how- 
ever, has made the balance so even over the 
globe, that the seeker for her treasures finds 
sufficient occupation and diversion. The gold- 
seeker is ever rewarded with a host of tales, if 
not with a phethoi-a of wealth ; and of the tales, 
Mr. Macdonald has garnered his share. At times 
his adventures are a little too marvellous, the 
coincidences a bit too striking, and the luck 
or ill-luck slightly too much colored ; but we can 
appreciate the stories, for they are capitally told.

REMrNISCENCES OF AX ENGLISH AllTIST.* 



Although not the foremost of living British 
artists, Mr. Walter Crane enjoys the distinction 
of being the most widely known. Wherever 
the English language is spoken, his name for 
more than a quarter of a century has been as a 
household word among those to whom art is 
something more than a mere abstraction. Nor 
is his fame confined to his own countrymen and 
theu- cousins in the colonies and in America. It 
is even greater on the continent of Europe than 
at home ; and in Germany, Austria, and Italy, 
in particular, he is the idol of a considerable 
nimiber of the more progressive spirits who 
regard placid acceptance of traditional views as 
stifling, and hail Mr. Crane as the leatler under 
whose guidance the arts of design shall be 
revivified. 

The reason for this lies not so much in the 
quality of the work from Mr. Crane's hand, as 
in the fact that almost from the beginning of his 
career he has been a pioneer. To some extent 
also it is attributable to his fertility of ideas, and 
to a fondness for allegory which captivates those 
who value art less for its aesthetic message than

hundred and twenty-three illustrations by the author, and others

for the esoteric meaning — even if thinly veiled 
— of its spiritual content. 

Mr. Crane was born in 1845, and his career 
as an artist may be said to have begun while he 
was yet a schoolboy of twelve. He was only thir- 
teen when he was apprenticed to the eminent 
wood-engraver, W. J. Linton, to learn the craft 
of drawing on the wood, in that day a necessary 
accomplishment for those who intended devoting 
themselves to book illustrating. In 1863, an 
introduction to Mr. Edmund Evans — whose 
name deserves wide renown for notable achieve- 
ment in the development of color-printing — led 
to the designing of the children's picture-books 
with which, so long as he continues to be known, 
the name of Walter Crane will be associated. 
He was but twenty when the first of these l>ooks 
appeared. Like many so-called children's books, 
their refinements m design and coloring were 
bcjyond the appreciation of the very young ; and, 
to quote Mr. Crane's words, they were issued 
" not without protest from the publishers, who 
thought the raw coarse colors and vulgar designs 
usually curre^jt appealed to a larger public, and 
therefore paid better." 

The distinctive quality of the Illustrations 
for these books was due in large measure to 
the influence of some Japanese color-prints that 
were presented to the artist by a lieutenant in 
the navy, who had recently visited Japan. From 
the first they found favor in the eyes of people 
of taste, and soon achieved wide popularity. 
Unfortimately, the cost of production made an 
edition of at least fifty thousand copies neces- 
sary to yield a profit to the publishers, and 
their unwillingness to allow Mr. Crane a royalty 
above the price paid him for his designs caused 
him to " strike," and so about 1875 the series 
came to an end. In 1876 " The Baby's Opera " 
was brought out mider different auspices ; and 
this, meeting with marked success, was followed 
by " The Babys Bouquet," " Baby's Own 
aEsop,' and, in the course of years, by many 
other picture-books to delight grown-up chil- 
dren if not wee ones. Though considered by 
Mr. Crane as of less importance than the more 
ambitious works sent by him to the London ex- 
hibitions, it is nevertheless upon his designs for 
book illustration, for paper hangings, and other 
decorative purposes, that his reputation chiefly 
rests. It was in these that he marked out a new 
path, and inspired others quite as much by 
what he suggested as by what he accomplished. 
Their teaching was reinforced by a book on 
" The Claims of Decorative Art," and by numer- 
ous lectures afterward published in book form.

Together with George Clausen. W. Holman 
Hunt, and others, ilr. Crane did much to give 
impetus to a movement begun in 1886 as a pro- 
test against the arrogant attitude of the Royal 
Academy, which, as Holman Hunt phrased it in 
a letter to " The Times,"' constituted •' a per- 
petual injury to art " by helping '• to dazzle the 
feeble judgments of the world as to what is true 
merit." The idea of an exhibition open to all 
artists, each of whom should be eligible upon 
committees and should have a voice in their 
selection, appealed strongly to Mr. Crane, who 
about this time had become an ardent socialist 
of the type representetl by William Morris. 
Through the timidity of many of its supporters, 
the original idea fell through : but it bore fruit 
a little later in the formation of the Arts and 
Crafts Exhibition Society, of which 3>Ir. Crane 
was the first president. To the extensive adv^- 
tising this movement received, his popularity on 
the continent may in large measure be ascribed, 
though it would be unfair to hold him responsi- 
ble for the eccentricities perpetrated by some of 
his disciples imder the guise of " Secessionism " 
and " L'Art Nouveau." 

In the course of an active life and extensive 
travel. Mr. Crane has been brought into con- 
tact, and frequently into intimate relations, with 
many of the distinguished men of his day. It 
might well be expected, therefore, that in " An 
Artist's Reminiscences "' he would give a new 
exemplification of the sajnng that such recol- 
lections furnish the most fascinating form of 
literary dissipation. Instead, we have a long 
autobiography, crowded with tri\Tal detail, in- 
teresting, no doubt, to the circle of those imme- 
diately concerned, but not esjjecially enlivening 
to the world at large. \\'here detail would be 
of interest it is often lacking. The catalogue 
of eminent people whom he mentions is little 
more than a list of names, casually introduced, 
— as in the following example : 

" We continued to extend our a^uaintanceship in 
Rome, chiefly in the English and American colony. At 
the hotel Molaro, nearly opposite to us, lived Mr. Healy 
and his family. He was an American portrait painter 
of considerable repute in his own country. They used 
to give evening conversazioni: and I remember on Mie 
occasion, in the spring of 1872, General Sherman, who 
had been Commander-in-Chief of the Northern forces 
in the American Civil War, was the principal lion, — a 
tall, thin, keen, but kindly-looking American." 

To such brevities of description there are 
. naturally many exceptions, and there are occa- 
sional word-pictures for which we should be 
grateful. One of these — it is too long to be 
here given in full — tells of his early master, 
Mr. LLuton. 



" W. J. Linton was in appearance small of stature, 
but a very remarkable-looking man. His fair hair, 
rather fine and thin, fell in actual locks to his shoulders, 
and he wore a long flowing beard and mustache, then 
beginning to be tinged with grey. A keen, impulsive- 
looking, highly sensitive face, with kindly blue eyes, 
looked out under the unusually broad brim of a black 
' wide awake.' He wore turn-down c<d]ars when the 
rest of the world mostly turned them up — a loose con- 
tinental-looking necktie, black velvet waistcoat, and a 
long-waisted coat of a very peculiar cut, having no 
traditional two buttons at the junction of the skirts 
at the back, trousers of an antique pattern belonging 
to the ' forties,' rather tight at the knees and falling 
over Wellington boots with small slits at the sides. He 
had abundance of nervous energy, and moved with » 
quick, rapid step, coming into the office with a sort of 
breezy rush, bringing with him always a stimulating 
sense of vitality. He spoke rapidly in a light-ton^ 
voice, frequently punctuated with a curious dry, 
obstructed sort of laugh." 

Amusinff anecdote is not abundant in the 
book, and it is a pity to be obliged to state that 
as a literary production it is marred by rather 
frequent slipshod writing. In this there is some- 
times entertainment, as when we read : 

" Bateman was the most remarkable draughtsman of 
flowers among modems I have seen, after the best 
Japanese work." 

But what shall be said about such a sentence 
as the following ? 

" This had the effect of malting me very shy of offer- 
ing any more MS. to editors, though I continued to 
write, simply as an outlet for one's thoughts and ideas." 

Mr. Crane's comments upon both people and 
events are always kindly, and are singularly 
free from acrimony. If he ever had fallings- 
out with any of his associates, he has seen fit to 
keep them to himself. In this connection, one 
incident that he relates is worth repeating for 
the light it throws upon the view held by Sir 
Edwaid Bume-Jones regarding the work of 
another eminent artist. 

" Mr. Leyhnd of Prince's Gate I also met about this 
time. He was a notable patron of art, and very wealthy, 
but became still more celebrated as the owner of the 
famous peacock room decorated by Wliistler. I recall 
a dinner in that room he gave to a company of artists, 
most of them exhibitors at the Grosvenor, I think, as 
well as some R.A.'s. Bume-Jones was there, and Val. 
Prinsep, G. H. Boughton, E. J. Pointer, T. Armstrong, 
Spencer Stanhope (I think), Comvns Carr, and others. 
I sat next to Bxime-Jones, and the conversation happened 
to turn on Whistler's work, and I expressed my appre- 
ciation of its artistic quality. I was rather surprised 
to find, however, that Bume-Jones could not, or would 
not, see his merit as an artist, or recognize the differ^ 
ence of his aims. He seemed to think there was only 
one right way of painting, and after a little discussicMi, 
he said, with some emphasis, ' This is the only time we 
ever had a difference and — it shall be the last ! ' I 
forgot, or did not realize, that the libel case of Whistler 
V. Ruskin was about to come on, in which Bume-Jones 
was an important witness for the defendant, and, in

fact, though much against the grain, and only under the 
strongest pressure from Ruskiu, he undertook to appear 
in court for him. Under the circumstances he could 
hardly aiford to allow any credit to Whistler." 

Admirers of Mr. Crane's art will find scat- 
tered through the pages of the volume a very 
full record of his work in various forms, and 
reproductions in black-and-white of many of his 
more important compositions. The book will 
be valued for these, but still more as the life- 
record of a man of refined and gentle person- 
ality, who, while keeping well to the fore in the 
storm and stress of a busy world, has yet been 
more truly a dweller in " the magic world of 
romance and pictured poetry."

Travel and Description. 
The residential London Square is essentially an 
English institution. Those groups of private houses, 
whose inhabitants have a sort of prescriptive right 
over the iron-fenced park or garden on which their 
residences abut, have no counterpart in any other 
quarter of the globe. And they are as fascinating 
as they are unique, — these pleasant green oases set 
in the thick of the noisy and murky city. It is of 
these residential Squares, far more numerous than 
the uninformed reader would believe, that Mr. E. 
Beresford Chancellor has written, entitling his study 
"The History of the Squares of London, Topo- 
graphical and Historical " (Lippincott). The stout 
quarto volume is handsomely bound, and thirty-six 
photogravure illustrations reproduce quaint old 
prints, engravings, and drawings, picturing the 
Squares in by-gone days. "It has been absolutely 
impossible to be exhaustive in the treatment of the 
different Squares," writes Mr. Chancellor in his pre- 
face. " What I have attempted to do, is to set down 
their history, to describe their formation, to trace 
the occupancy of their houses to interesting, notable, 
and, in some cases, notorious people, and here and 
there to enliven a mere dull enumeration of names 
and dates by some story or anecdote which may 
seem to be not wholly out of place in a book of this 
character. Had I attempted to do more than this, 
the result would have been stupendous, for it is a 
fact that, taken as a whole, the history of the Squares 
of London and their inhabitants, past and present, 
makes a large inroad on the literary, the artistic, and 
the political annals of the country." The most fam- 
ous Squares are treated separately, the others are 
discussed in neighborhood groups. Mr. Chancellor's 
account of his style is too modest. There is very 
little indeed in his book that can accurately be called 
"dull enumeration," and there are plenty of anec- 
dotes, bits of forgotten history, and curious reminis- 
cence. " London is nothing to some people," Mr. 
Chancellor quotes Dr. Johnson as saying, " but to a 



man whose pleasure is intellectual, London is the 
place." It is to this type of man, who loves the Lon- 
don squares and streets for their crowding human 
associations — with real people and with imaginary 
people, who, thanks to Dickens and Thackeray and 
the rest, are no less real, — that Mr. Chancellor's 
scholarly and yet picturesque record will appeal. For 
such a person it is hard to imagine a more welcome 
gift than this leisurely guide to the quiet little squares 
through which he has often rambled, with a pleasure 
in the scenes that was vague by comparison with 
the vivid enjoyment that Mr. Chancellor's good 
company will afford him. 

Quite different in its appeal, but equally infused 
with the pungent, compelling charm of London, is 
one of Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.'s holiday 
publications, " The Colour of London, Historic, Per- 
sonal, and Local." The text is written by Mr. W. J. 
Loftie, and the illustrations and a quaint essay are 
furnished by the Japanese artist, Yoshio Markino, 
whose career in London is the subject of an appre- 
ciative introduction by Mr. M. H. Spielmann. Mr. 
Loftie writes of a few of the myriad aspects of Lon- 
don, — its color, in the broadest sense of the word, 
its boundaries and districts, its fashionable quarters 
past and present, its curious names, its pleasant parks, 
its quaint records and its quainter corporation gov- 
ernment, — treating them all in a delightfully sug- 
gestive fashion, with a true feeling for the oddities 
and ramifications of his subject. The artist's essay 
is an amusingly naive account of his impressions of 
London and its people, of his artistic experiences 
there, and particularly of his delight in the London 
fog, wnth its mystically beautifying influence on line 
and color. Like all Japanese artists, Mr. Markino 
makes only skeleton sketches on the spot, filling them 
up later from memory and aiming at essential truth 
rather than accuracy of detail. His studies of Lon- 
don are neither Japanese nor European, but a blend 
of the two. It seems unlikely that fuU justice has 
been done their delicate coloring in the printing, but 
even so they are pretty, quaint, striking, and sugges- 
tive of new values. Some of the best are night-scenes 
done in sepia. The subjects vary from "Sunday 
Morning in Petticoat Lane," " The Flower-Sellers, 
Piccadilly," and " Sloan Square on a Wet Day," to 
"Tourists before St. Paul's Cathedral," " A Winter 
Afternoon, Chelsea Embankment," and "The Porch 
of the Carlton Hotel at Night." The enterprising 
young Japanese, that is to say, seems to know all 
parts of his beloved London, and to have observed 
it with the stranger's open-mindedness and the 
artist's sensitiveness to effect. 

It is seldom, even in these days of unique and 
beautiful travel books, that anything so thoroughly 
delightful as Mr. Edward Penfield's " Holland 
Sketches " (Scribner) is published. The illustra- 
tions, some of which have already appeared in con- 
nection with the " Sketches " in Scribner's Magazine, 
are of course in the poster style, which Mr. Penfield 
originated in America, and which he has developed, 
both artistically and mechanically, in a manner quite

his own. Nothing could be better suited to his style 
than the quaint Dutch peasants in their baggy trousers 
or voluminous skirts, picturesque caps, and clumsy 
wooden sabots. Queer little by-streets, flapping wind- 
mills on the banks of quiet canals, fishing smacks 
with patched brown sails, " interiors " hung with 
Delft and old brasses, — these are the things that 
Mr. Penfield paints and writes about. Geographi- 
cally speaking, he does not go far from the beaten 
path in his wanderings through Holland ; but he 
never has a beaten-track experience, even when he 
travels to Marken on the regular tourists' steamer. 
He went from Rotterdam to Friesland in a " boeier," 
which is a real Dutch freight-boat, willing to carry 
stray passengers and advertised to sail '' any time 
to-day." " ' Any time to-day ! ' " Mr. Penfield com- 
ments. " How delightfully Dutch! Everyone has time 
to talk and smoke, and no one is ever in a hurry. For 
a life of elegant leisure, commend me to Holland." 
Thus at every point Mr. Penfield shows himself in 
sympathy with the situation in which he finds him- 
self, whether he is spending a lonely " Christmas at 
Caf^ Spaander," poking around the side-streets of 
Amsterdam, or buying a sandwich in *' The Magenta 
Village" of a woman who refuses to understand 
his Dutch but capitulates to his realistically colored 
drawing of bread and cheese. 

A book like " Poets' Country " (Lippincott ), which 
aims to trace the relations of some English poets 
with the aspects of " their ain countrie," and to pic- 
ture these scenes in beautiful colored illustrations, 
might easily degenei-ate into a purely mechanical 
performance. But with Mr. Andrew Lang as editor, 
and joint contributor with Professor J. Churton 
Collins, and Messrs. E. Hartley Coleridge, W. J. 
Loftie, and Michael MacmiUan, and with Mr. 
Francis S. Walker supplying fifty oil paintings for 
colored reproduction, " Poets' Country " cannot fail 
to possess substantial literary and artistic merits. 
Mr. Lang's preface points out that there are poets 
and poets ; some who are nomads from birth, loving 
strange lands better than their own, some, like 
Shelley, whose country is the " Land of Dreams," 
but others, like Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, 
Drayton, or Tennyson, who found their highest 
inspiration in the familiar English scenes among 
which their lives were spent. However, the dreamers 
and the wanderers have not been excluded from this 
book ; and some of the essays which show how little 
a poet may know about nature are quite as illumin- 
ating as those devoted to the poets who were patient 
and loving students of her many moods. The 
authors and the illustrator have varied their methods 
to suit a wide range of subjects, and yet each con- 
tribution is distinctive of its author's individuality. 
The book is one to delight lovers of poetry and 
lovers of the English country. There are twenty- 
four essays, discussing as many poets or groups of 
poets, and varied authorship gives them both variety 
and authority. The illustrations are intrinsically 
beautiful, and are, besides, excellent examples of the 
best modern color-printing. 



It is now more than forty years since Mr. William 
Dean HoweUs published his " Venetian Life," but 
the flood of travel-literatvire that has followed in 
its wake has not thrust it from its assured place in 
American letters. In fitting recognition of this fact 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifilin & Co. have issued a beau- 
tiful new edition, for which twenty full-page illustra- 
tions in color have been furnished by Mr. Edmund 
H. Garrett. The typography and general plan of 
the volume were placed in the hands of Mr. Bruce 
Rogers, designer of the Riverside Press editions, 
and it is needless to say that the result is a book of 
rare distinction. Mr. HoweUs has done his part by 
adding to and revising his impressions and by writ- 
ing a personal introduction, addressed " to the read- 
er's private eye," which chronicles the history of his 
maiden adventure in the field of pure literature, and 
comments, with delightfid humor, upon the author's 
early style and youthful point of view. Mr. Grarrett's 
illustrations make a worthy and harmonious com- 
plement to the text, though necessarily limiting 
themselves to its pictorial interest. It is the peculiar 
charm of Mr. Howells's interpretation of Venice 
that it is not limited to these aspects; the beauty 
of the city of lagoons, the humor and the pictm-esque- 
ness of its social life, and the wealth of its historical 
associations are combined in his pages to form a 
signally complete and sympathetic interpretation of 
a fascinating theme. 

Most of the travel-books mentioned in this article 
describe regions likely to be familiar to many of their 
readers, who will enjoy living over their own experi- 
ences while they share those of the authors. But 
"The Savage South Seas" (MacmiUan), painted by 
Mr. Norman Hardy and described by Mr. E. Way 
Elkington, wUl attract by virtue of the novelty of 
its theme. The material of the book is arranged 
under three headings — British New Guinea, the 
Solomon Islands, and the New Hebrides. There 
are sixty colored page-plates, portraying the island 
scenery and the native tj-pes and manners and cus- 
toms in a great variety of aspects. As is fortunately 
coming more and more to be the rule nowadays, the 
text of the book is well worthy of the pains that have 
been taken to beautify it. Mr. Elkington is not a 
tourist writing impressions caught snap-shot fashion 
over a steamer raUing. Sixteen years ago he took 
his first trip to New Zealand, where he tried gold 
and gum digging, cattle-driving, and journalism. 
Since then he has traveUed around the world, and 
has already published several volumes reminiscent 
of his South Sea experiences. He does not state 
any of these facts in the text, which is a purely 
impersonal narrative ; but the authoritative tone and 
the evidently intimate knowledge of native customs 
are proof positive of something beyond a cursory 
observation of life among the islanders. 

" From Gretna Green to Land's End " (CroweU) 
is a book that readers who look forward to a trip 
abroad will enjoy and that returned traveUers wUl 
thoroughly appreciate. Miss Katherine Lee Bates 
is its author, and her text is supplemented by excel-

lent illustrations made from photogi-aphs especially 
taken for this book. Miss Bates writes informally 
of her summer wanderings through the west of 
England. History, ballad lore, '' open-air delights," 
and particularly literary associations, are touched 
upon in informal, intimate fashion, the variety of 
scenes visited making possible a delightful variety 
of impressions. Miss Bates does not get far off the 
beaten tracks, but her experiences are not the casual 
ones of the hurried summer tourist. Her reminis- 
cences have a leisurely atmosphere ; and she de- 
scribes several unique sights like the Ambleside and 
Grasmere rush-bearings and some out-of-the-way 
villages in Devonshire and Cornwall. 

No doubt all cities are complex, meaning a differ- 
ent thing and making a different appeal to each 
observer; but perhaps none is quite so subtle or so 
many-sided as Paris. In "Nooks and Corners of 
Old Paris" (Lippincott) M. Georges Cain introduces 
us to a Paris that probably no one else knows as well 
as he. M. Cain is curator of the Carnavalet Museum, 
which houses the historic collections of the city of 
Paris. Of the object of his book he writes: "Seek- 
ing only the rare, if not the never-yet-brought-to- 
light, we would simply give to those who, like us, 
adore our old City a little of the joy we have each 
day in ' strolling ' about this incomparable Town. 
Our object is to continue, by means of walks through 
what remains to us of the dear old Paris, the series 
of documents painted, pencilled, or engraved, which 
are contained in the Carnavalet Museum. ... It is 
a delightful nook in which still throbs a little of the 
old soul of the great City ! " There is nothing aloof 
or academic in M. Cain's account of the landmarks 
of the Paris of by-gone days ; he takes his readers 
on four delightful rambles through four divisions of 
the region that held the germs of the great city of 
to-day. The book is artistically illustrated from 
photographs, etchings, drawings, and water-colors, 
some from the Carnavalet and other historic collec- 
tions, others showing modern views of the old quar- 
ters. This notice would be sadly incomplete should 
it conclude without some mention of the long and 
delightful introduction contributed by M. Victorien 
Sardou, who gives many entertaining reminiscences 
of the Paris of his childhood and youth. 

" A Spring Fortnight in France " ( Dodd, Mead ), 
by Miss Josephine Tozier, is a sprightly combina- 
tion of romantic fiction and traveller's impressions. 
Angela Victoria, its protagonist, is a delightful 
wanderer, who goes where she pleases, sees what she 
pleases, and always has a good time. In her own 
charming fashion she visits Le Mans, Poitiers, 
Carcassonne, Aries, Tarascon, and half a dozen other 
cities of Southern France, and many excellent illus- 
trations from photographs show characteristic views 
of them. Angela Victoria had an object in making 
her journey. She had been intending ever since 
she was sixteen to write a book; and at thirty-six 
she had finally gotten as far as to decide that it 
should be a book of travel. But, as usual, Angela 
Victoria did the unexpected — or at least the unan- 



nounced. Among the many things that pleased her 
rather uncritical taste were good-looking men. She 
happened upon one at Angers, met him again at 
Saumur, helped him to explore Poitiers, — after 
having been properly introduced by some friends 
who appeared opportunely in a motor car, — definitely 
abandoned the book at Carcassonne, and at Tarascon 
accepted the man, who promised that she should 
continue to travel as she pleased and should write 
ten books about each trip if she wanted to. 

It woidd be hard to imagine a more delightful 
and appropriate subject for a lavishly illustrated 
book of travel than the Riviera. Its possibilities 
have been utilized to the full by Mr. William Scott, 
who is both author and artist of "The Riviera," 
just published by the Macmillan Company. As is 
perhaps inevitable when the character of the subject 
is considered, the book is chiefly- notable for its illus- 
trations. These depict both the gaiety and the quaint- 
ness of the region, its tropically luxuriant vegetation, 
its crags and castles, and its changeful blue sea. Alto- 
gether they give a complete and artistic picture of 
the region which some one has called the loveliest 
garden-spot of the eai'th. The text is filled with 
information, and it is hard to think of a phase of the 
subject that it does not touch upon, from accounts 
of the early inhabitants to descriptions of Riviera 
tourists and " chit>chat " about the characteristic 
delicacies of the Riviera hotels. Three chapters, 
one on the French Riviera and two on the Northern 
and Southern stretches of the Italian coast, give the 
intending traveller a cursory glance at the many 
stopping-places from which he may take his choice ; 
while a general chapter entitled " The Sunny South " 
gives a bird's-eye view of the whole region and 
suggests some unexplored corners of it and some 
unconventional points of view for the consideration 
of the traveller who wishes to see things with his 
own eyes. 

"Mexico and Her People To-day" (Page) is a 
book of up-to-date information of a miscellaneous 
sort about a nation concerning which, thougli she 
stands at our very doors, most of us know very little. 
As Mr. Nevin A. Winter, author of the book, puts 
it, " Every schoolboy knows of Loch Katrine and 
Loch Lomond in bonnie Scotland, and most people 
are familiar with the location of Lago di Como in 
Italy. And yet I should not be surprised if fair- 
sized towns could be found in the United States 
where no one could tell whether such a body of water 
as Lake Chapala existed or not. As a matter of 
fact, it is ten times as large as all the lakes of 
Northern Italy combined ; and it embraces islands 
larger than the entire surface of Loch Lomond." 
This is probably a fair example of the popular ignor- 
ance about Mexican geography, and it undoubtedly 
extends to the resources of the country and their 
state of development, if not to the customs and 
characteristics of the people. The author's preface 
calls attention to the fact that many of the best books 
about Mexico are now out of print, wliile American

Miss Estelle M. Hui-U's volume on " Portraits and 
Portrait Painting " (Page) deals with a branch of art 
which the amateur student is likely to find both diffi- 
cult of approach and unattractive; and accordingly 
it has been generally avoided by the writers of popu- 
lar art-manuals. Miss Hurll, however, has braved 
prejudice and chosen the field of portraiture for ex- 
ploitation in her latest Ijook. The studies are effec- 
tively illustrated in sepia half-tones, which reproduce 
a representative collection of great portraits, from 
Botticelli's time to Sargent's. A brief but very signi- 
ficant introduction puts the tyro right upon the gen- 
eral principles of portrait-painting, suggesting the 
correspondence between poi-traiture and literary 
biography, explaining the interpretative, aesthetic, 
and photographic purposes of the art, the difference 
between the subjective and objective methods, and 
the general relation between the painter and his time 
and environment With these interests in mind, the 
reader embarks the more readily upon the main 
body of the text, which is a brief survey of portrait 
painting from the Middle Ages to the present, show- 
ing what each age and nationality has contributed 
to the art, with some information about the people 
who, often quite by chance, have been fortunate 
enough to be the subjects of famous portraits. "It 
is impossible to put one's finger upon a definite date 
for the origin of portrait painting," Miss Hurll ex- 
plains, because it grew gradually out of religious 
figure-painting ; but the general reader will be well 
satisfied to begin with the Italian painters of the 
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Titian, Dilrer, 
Holbein, Rubens, Van Dyke, Frans Hals. Rem- 
brandt, and Velasquez are accorded detailed study, 
and there are general chapters dealing with schools 
and tendencies. The ability, alreatly noticed in con- 
nection with the preface, to hold the reader's inter- 
est by a crisp style, and by a skilful presentation of 
salient points and large issues, is evident throughout 
the book, which is an unusually satisfactory example 
of its class. 

The preface to the first edition of Mr. Kenyon 
Cox's " Old Ma-sters and New," published without 
illustrations in 1905, gave promise of a future edition, 
augmented and enlarged, in which those masters and 
others, old and new, should be treated of. The pub- 
lishers decided, however, that an entirely different 
collection of essays should be offered, rather than an 
enlarged edition of the first series, and " Painters 
and Sculptors" (Duffield), handsomely bound and 
profusely illustrated with upwards of a hundred full- 
page reproductions, many from rare and inaccessible 
originals, is the result That an artist may be quite 
as broad-minded in his views of art as any lajinan, 



the writings of Fromentin sufliciently attest ; that 
Mr. Cox is an artist of equal catholicity of judgment 
is proved by the present volume, in which the artist- 
critic touches upon "The Education of an Artist," 
"The Pollaiuoli," "Painters of the Mode," "Hol- 
bein," " The Rembrandt Tercentenary," " Rodin," 
and "Lord Leighton." Through these pages we 
are helped to acquaintance with the artists whose 
names figure in the chapter headings, shown their 
points of view, and given a general insight into their 
pictorial methods and motives. It is a careful and 
detailed work, which will of course appeal especially 
to students of art, the numerous illustrations being 
valuable adjuncts to an appreciation of the great 
masters' work. With these, and a tasteful binding, 
the volume is one of the attractive holiday books of 
the season. 

"Famous Painters of America" (Crowell), by Mr. 
J. Walker McSpadden, is a book about painters rather 
than a book about painting. Eleven men — West, 
Copley, Stuart Inness, Vedder, Winslow, Homer, 
La Farge, Whistler, Sargent Abbey, and Chase — 
are the subjects of as many biographical sketches. 
The author's aim is to give a readable, picturesque 
account of the artists as men, telling how their im- 
pulse to paint first showed itself, how they worked 
behind their easels, and how they lived among their 
friends. There is only the most casual effort to 
appraise an artist's work or estimate his standing, 
though the story of the origin of a picture is given, 
where it has a human interest and there are some 
descriptions of paintings, but always from the prac- 
tical observer's point of view. Mr. McSpadden is 
a lively chronicler, and understands the art of telling 
an effective anecdote, as well as of judicious quota- 
tion from memoirs, autobiography, and magazine 
reminiscences. There is a bibliog^phy for the use of 
students who wish to pursue their researches further, 
and forty excellent pictures of the painters and their 
work. The make-up of the book is decidedly attrac- 
tive, and while its point of view is popular there is 
nothing superficial about its method. 

The season's addition to Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.'s 
guides to the art galleries of Europe is "The Art 
of the Prado," written by Mr. Charles S. Ricketts. 
It is imiform with other volumes in the series, bound 
in cloth, appropriately decorated, and profusely 
illustrated with full-page plates in duogravure. The 
Prado gallery is probably one of the least known, 
as it is certainly one of the most interesting, among 
the world's great treasure-houses of art In a suc- 
cinct introductory chapter, Mr. Ricketts explains the 
general character of the collection, which he de- 
scribes as less complete and constructive than the 
Louvre, wider in range than the galleries of Venice, 
MUan, or Antwerp. — as a whole the result of magni- 
ficent art patronage exercised, at particularly for- 
tunate moments and without too much national bias, 
to produce " a gallery of masterpieces." Among 
these, the collection is rich in works of Rubens, 
Titian, and the Italian painters of the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries ; while all the greatest pictures

of Velasquez, with four or five exceptions, are to be 
found here, and there is no other place where the 
specialist can study the Spanish school. On the other 
hand. Van Dyke's portrait work is poorly represented, 
and there is an almost total absence of Italian Prim- 
itives, except Fra Angelico and Mantegna. When 
he embarks xipon detailed criticism, Mr. Ricketts is 
fortunate in his ability to awaken and to hold his 
readers' attention. He apportions his space about 
evenly between the Spanish painters and the out- 
siders, so to speak. He does not burden his pages 
with detail imintelligible to everyone except the few 
who read his book in direct connection with their 
visits to the Prado ; and he does understand how to 
give his criticism a turn which is at once illuminat- 
ing and suggestive. The plates are of excellent 
quality, and their subjects are wisely chosen. 

Since Mr. Gibson withdrew from the field of 
black-and-white illustration, Mr. Hannson Fisher 
has taken his place as the matinee-idol, so to speak, 
among illustrators, and the painter 'par excellence of 
the beautiful American girl and the weU-dressed and 
well-groomed men who naturally dog her footsteps. 
This account of the matter is fair neither to Mr. 
Gibson nor Mr. Fisher, because it allows popularity 
of subject-matter and facility of style to obscure 
masterly workmanship, a gift for pictorial anecdote, 
aiid a keen appreciation of the " human comedy " of 
life and love. "The Harrison Fisher Book" of pic- 
tures, which Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons publish, 
contains work in both black-and-white and in color, 
including illustrations of popular novels, pictures 
which have appeared in various magazines, and many 
drawings hitherto unpublished, — altogether a repre- 
sentative selection from the artist's best work. The 
cover-design is a "Harrison Fisher girl " done in color. 

Illustrated Books of Fiction. 
Dr. Henry van Dyke has found an extremely 
tempting title for his new volume of stories and 
essays. "Days Off and Other Digressions" (Scribner) 
suggests all sorts of vague and therefore delightful 
possibilities, which Dr. van Dyke brings to realiza- 
tion in his characteristically charming fashion. The 
introductory essay states that " A day o£E is a day 
that a man takes to himself," explains this thesis, 
and suggests modestly that the essays interspersed 
among the stories, on day-off opinions and preju- 
dices, are merely chapters to be read or skipped, as 
the reader's day-oif humor pleases. Furthermore, 
nothing in the book is meant " to prove anything, 
or convince anybody, or convey any profitable in- 
struction"; it is only a book to "browse through" 
in one's days off. The first story, with its ironic 
title, " A Holiday in a Vacation," certainly belongs 
in the book. The next is a "Fisherman's Luck" 
tale, telling how Bolton Chichester of the Petrine 
Clnb went fishing when he was engaged to be mar- 
ried, and thereby met with a singular adventure. 
" Books that I Loved as a Boy," " Notions about 
Novels," and " The Art of Leaving Off " are written 
in informal conversational style, and are based on 



distinctly day-off philosophy. Among the nature 
essays and animal stories, " Silver-horns " will pro- 
bably raise fresh doubts in the minds of some 
naturalists, whUe " Little Red Tom" is labelled " A 
Contribution to the Fight about Nature Books." A 
number of attractively tinted illustrations and an 
artistic cover-design give a decorative touch to a 
volume that is sure to be a favorite with holiday 
shoppers. 

One of the prettiest novelettes of this season, as 
well as one of the most delightful from a literary 
point of view, is Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin's " The 
Old Peabody Pew" (Houghton). It appears in 
holiday dress with colored illustrations by Miss Alice 
Barber Stephens, and festive page decorations and 
end-papers in color. Mrs. Wiggin's sub-title, " A 
Christmas Romance of a Country Church," states 
tersely the three elements that combine to produce 
the simple little story's charm. There is the Christ- 
mas spirit, which makes the book an especially 
appropriate holiday gift, there is romance, — the 
inevitable feature of successful fiction, — and there 
is the genuine atmosphere of old New England, easy 
enough to counterfeit, but very difficult to reproduce 
in a fashion that will create the illusion of reality for 
those who have intimate knowledge of the quiet little 
villages clustering about their white-spired churches, 
with their Dorcas Societies, their Peabody Pews, 
and their humble romances. The story appeared 
some two years ago in one of the magazines ; in 
covers — especially in covers as pretty as those 
which have been provided for it — it is sure to find 
hosts of new readers. 

" Holly " is a Southern girl, beautiful of course, 
and fascinating to the verge of distraction, whUe 
her inexperience, her orphaned state, and her "re- 
duced circumstances " lend the needed touch of 
pathos to the portrait. HoUy lived in a house which 
she supposed was her own, but which really, through 
a series of curious accidents, belonged to a certain 
Mr. Winthrop of Boston. He, supposing it to be 
empty, came down to Florida to occupy his prop- 
erty during a much needed vacation — and found 
Holly. His invalid state disarmed Holly of her sec- 
tional prejudices, but there are plenty of other com- 
plications — including an irascible Southern suitor 
approved by all Holly's friends — to make a lively 
story. It is related by Mr. Ralph Henry Barbour, 
well known as a writer of clever novelettes. Being 
longer and more ambitious than his previous efforts, it 
is natural that it should not be quite so well finished. 
Nevertheless "Holly" is a pretty story, prettUy 
bound, and illustrated in line and color by Mr. Edwin 
F. Bayha. ( Lippincott. ) 

"Gallantry " (Harper) is the odd title bestowed 
by Mr. James Branch Cabell upon a collection of 
twelve of his eighteenth century tales, reprinted, 
with considerable additions, from various magazines. 
One of them, " In the Second AprU," was accom- 
panied, when it appeared in " Harper's Magazine," 
by four colored illustrations done by Mr. Howard 
Pyle. These are reproduced with the new version.

The distinctive character of Mr. Cahell's short-story 
type is too well known to need much comment. His 
stories are studies of temperament, of epochs, of 
" precious " stylistic effects ; but the story-interest 
invariably remains strong. " Gallantry," it appears 
from the quaint " Epistle Dedicatory to Mrs. 
Grundy," is Mr. Cabell's characterization of the atti- 
tude of the eighteenth century towards life. His 
description of the gallant is, a bit of very pretty 
writing in prose, pleasantly suggestive, as is the 
versified prologue, of Mr. Andrew Lang. 

'• My Lady Caprice," by Mr. Jetfery Farnol, has 
already been printed in magazine form under another 
title — "Chronicles of the Imp." It is now pub- 
lished by Messi"s. Dodd, Mead & Co. with four 
colored pictures by Miss Cliarlotte Weber Ditzler, 
besides decorated headings and page-borders, and a 
pretty cover from which the " Lady Caprice " her- 
self, done in facsimile of a gold-framed miniature, 
looks mockingly out at the reader. The comedy of 
which she is heroine is set in London and at Selwyn 
Park, countiy-seat of the attractive young English- 
man whom a titled aunt of the capricious Miss 
Elizabeth has selected as her niece's future husband. 
But the Imp, who is Elizabeth's nephew, and the 
hero, who tells his own story, conspire to defeat this 
plan. The Imp is decidedly the most ingenious and 
interesting person in the book, but the Lady's posi- 
tion as the central figure in the romance furnishes 
good warrant for giving her the title-r6le. 

In the " Little Novels of Famous Cities " series 
(Stokes ) appears Mr. Duffield Osborne's pretty story 
of old-time Perugia, entitled " The Angels of Messer 
Ercole." The small size of the book, its decorated 
cover and page-borders, and the sepia-tinted illus- 
trations — from photogi-aphs of Perugia, her master- 
painters, and their works — are the holiday features 
of the edition. The story, which has been printed 
before, relates how Ercole da Passigno, humble pupil 
in painting of Pietro Vaimucci, "The Perugian," 
became a bold lover, daring to lift his eyes to the 
golden-haired Princess Ottavia Baglioni; and how 
between them they defied " coward caution and the 
pride of princes " and made their dream of love 
come true. 

Staxdakd Literature et Holiday Form. 
Undoubtedly the most sumptuous of the illustrated 
new editions of the year is Messrs. Button's reprint 
of "The Ingoldsby Legends," with pictures by Mr. 
Arthur Rackham. Mr. Rackham's illustrations for 
" Peter Pan " were so popular last fall as to create 
an urgent demand for more of his work, new or old ; 
and accordingly a small English edition of " The 
Ingoldsby Legends," published in 1898, has been 
used as a basis, so to speak, of a new definitive edi- 
tion. That is. some of the pen-and-ink drawings in 
the earlier edition have been reproduced for the new 
one, with more or less re-drawing and on a larger 
scale to conform to the quarto size of the issue. 
Many of the twenty-four colored illusti-ations are 
quite new, and the rest have been worked over and 



especially colored. Great pains have been taken with 
the color-printing, and special mounts are used for 
the colored and the more ambitious line-drawings. 
The text has been entirely re-set, and the binding is 
buckram with decorations in gUt. But these details 
are of small moment compared with the essential fact 
that Mr. Rackham has caught the fantastic humor 
of the " Legends " so perfectly that one feels for the 
first time his fuU power. " Rip Van Winkle " and 
even " Peter Pan " furnished him with a relatively 
small opportunity. Therefore admirers of Mr 
Rackham's very individual stj'le will prefer these 
drawings to any of his previous work; and persons 
who have been doubtful about the legitimacy of his 
effects and inclined to object to the loose rein he 
gives his imagination will find in the Rackham 
" Ingoldsby Legends " further evidence on which 
to base their distaste. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. honor the cen- 
tennial of Longfellow's birth by the publication of 
a new illustrated edition of "The Hanging of the 
Crane," daintily bound and elegantly printed. The 
publisher's note repeats Thomas Bailey Aldrich's 
interesting account of the origin of the poem, and 
explains that the dozen illustrations, which are done 
in color by Mr. Arthur I. Keller, were actually 
made at Craigie House, where the poem was written 
and most of the scenes which it relates were enacted. 
The colonial architecture of the house also furnishes 
motives for many of the text decorations by Miss 
Florence Swan. It is needless to say that the 
edition is mechanically a very beautiful one, well 
worthy of the anniversary that calls it forth. 

One of the prettiest of the season's holiday 
productions is Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.'s 
illustrated translation of "Immensee," Theodore 
Storm's idyllic masterpiece. Mr. George P. Upton, 
the translator, furnishes, besides a sing^arly grace- 
ful rendering of the text, an interesting apprecia- 
tion of Storm and his work. The illustrations and 
decorations are done by Margaret and Helen 
Maitland Armstrong, whose artistic cooperation is 
responsible for some of our most beautiful decorated 
editions. The water-lily, which was Reinhardt's 
symbol for his lost love, is the decorative motive on 
pages and cover. Nine delicately tinted illustrations 
reflect the lyric sentiment and restrained pathos of 
the text. 

"Old comedies are mostly those which, in spite 
of their being more than a hundred years old, are 
yet lively and sprightly enough to amuse a modern 
audience." So writes Mr. Brander Matthews in an 
appreciative introduction to a new illustrated edi- 
tion of "The Rivals " (Crowell). There is no ques- 
tion that "The Rivals" is "lively and sprightly 
enough" to please modern audiences, and modern 
readers too. Mr. Power O'Malley has illustrated 
the play for the present edition in a fashion to em- 
phasize both its old-time quaintness and its sparkling 
humor. His eighteen pictures are reproduced in 
photogravure, except the frontispiece, which is col- 
ored. Typography and binding are artistic.

[Dec. 1, 



Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish a beautiful 
holiday reprint of George Wither's " Christmas 
Carroll," with pictures and ornamental text done by 
Mr. Frank T. Merrill. The " Carroll " is printed 
twice, once in ornamental lettering, a couplet or a 
quatrain to a page, with dainty pen-and-ink drawings 
above and below it and on the opposite page; and 
again in type, plain and unadorned, at the back of 
the book. A brief note on the poet's life is also 
included. The end-leaves of this edition are espe- 
cially attractive ; and so is the cover, which depends 
upon fancy lettering and color for its adornment. 

A particularly attractive Christmas anthology is 
that compiled by Miss Ina RusseUe Warren, chiefly 
from the work of the older English poets. Of course 
there is no possibility of finding all one's old favor- 
ites in so small a collection, but there will surely be 
several of them in "Under theHoUy Bough" ( Jacobs ) . 
The book is illustrated vnth sepia half-tones, separ- 
ately mounted. The cover-decoration is a sort of 
composite of mistletoe and hoUy, the leaves being of 
the hoUy shape, but the berries, for some strange 
reason, colored white instead of red. 

Miscellaneous Holiday Books. 
Unique among the publications of this or any year 
is "The Indians' Book," "recorded and edited "by 
Miss Natalie Curtis, and published with every pos- 
sible advantage of typography and color-printing 
by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. The title-page de- 
scribes the book as "an offering by the American 
Indians of Indian lore, musical and narrative, to 
form a record of the songs and legends of their 
race," with illustrations from photographs and from 
original drawings by Indians. There is a curious 
foreword by Hiamori, Chief among the Cheyennes 
and the Dakotas, and one of the most enthusiastic 
and helpful of the contributors to the work. " I 
want all Indians and white men to read," he says, 
"and learn how the Indians lived and thought in 
the olden time, and may it bring holy-good upon the 
younger Indians to know of their fathers. A little 
while, and the old Indians wUl no longer be, and 
the young will be even as white men." This is, in 
brief, the double purpose of the book ; its originality 
consists in the fact that Miss Cmtis has literally 
done nothing but coUect, edit, and aiTange contri- 
butions actually made by the Indians. The songs 
and stories are theirs, chosen by the chiefs of the 
different tribes and their people, often after long 
and earnest considei'ation, as being the most worthy 
to be preserved among the lore of the tribe. The 
drawings, cover-design, and title-pages are all the 
free-hand work of Indians, although sometimes 
they have used an inverted basket to form a circle. 
The interesting lettering on the tribal title-pages, 
of which there are twenty-fom-, each with a char- 
acteristic symbolic design by a member of the tribe, 
was done by Miss Angel De Cora of the Winnebagoes, 
art instructor at the Carlisle Indian School. Miss 
Curtis's Introduction explains how she collected 
her material, going by rail, wagon, or on horseback 



from tribe to tribe ; offering friendship, and every- 
where meeting a warm response and hearty coopera- 
tion in her work, in which her part was planned to 
be that of "the white friend come to be the pencil 
in the hand of the Indians." She carried to the 
camps and villages only a note-book and pencil, a 
camera, and a color-box for the use of the Indians ; 
and she wrote down their songs and stories as she 
listened to them "by the light of the tipi fire or 
under the glare of the desert sun, in adobe houses 
while the women ground the corn, or in the open 
camp where after some festival or ceremonial 
gathering a leader re-sang for the book a character- 
istic song." She respected their superstitions and 
reserves, tried to represent all types of thought and 
all sides of life, especially to get at the primitive 
motives and notions of a primitive race, and to re- 
cord the stories and songs of the very oldest men. 
These were often entirely unknown to the younger 
tribesmen, and sometimes were even told in archaic 
language. Perhaps the best recommendation that 
Miss Curtis's work as editor, translator, and musical 
transcriber can have is the Indians' testimony that 
her book " speaks with the straight tongue," and the 
eagerness with which they have awaited its appear- 
ance. To most of its white readers the book will 
be a revelation of the vaguely stirring genius and 
the art, mystic in its intent, spontaneous in its 
symbolism, of a child race. 

It seems almost incredible, in view of the recent 
popularity of biography, that John Harvard's life 
should have waited untU now to be written. But 
the fact is that while his name became a household 
word in America long before George Washington's, 
absolutely nothing was known about him save that 
he was a minister of God and " gave gifts " ; so that 
when in 1842, James Savage offered a reward of five 
hundred doUars for five lines of information about 
John Harvard in any private or public capacity, no 
one could claim it. Since then, however, the baptis- 
mal entry in the archives of St. Saviour's Church, 
Southwark, has been discovered, and assiduous re- 
search has unearthed some other facts and suggested 
many theories. And now comes the first biography, 
written by Mr. Henry C. SheUey and entitled " John 
Harvard and His Times" (Little, Brown & Co.). 
"The pioneer is liable to take a wrong trail now and 
then," explains Mr. SheUey, modestly, in his pre- 
face ; " and some allowances will no doubt be made 
on that score." But Mr. Shelley shows himself ac- 
curate and unbiased in stating his slender store of 
absolutely determined facts, and singularly clever 
in piecing them together and eking them out with 
ingenious possibilities. One of the most interest- 
ing of these is involved in his attempt to prove, 
by a chain of circumstantial evidence, that the par- 
ents of John Harvard were introduced to each other 
by WiUiam Shakespeare. Throughout his account 
he aims to " place " John Harvard in his environ- 
ment, English and American, and thus to make a 
firm background for the somewhat attenuated out- 
line sketch, which further investigation may modify

or fill out The biography is appropriately hound in 
Harvard crimson, with the Harvard crest and other 
decorations in gold, and there are a number of inter- 
esting and apposite illustrations from photographs. 

"There were once two people who supposed that 
they had lived a happy life. To be sure, the Man 
Had Always Wanted a Farm, and the Woman Had 
Never Wanted a Country House ; but they had jogged 
along in comfortable and contented fashion for years 
and years, until that fateful moment when they 
walked one day in a forest." So Mrs. Frances 
Kinsley Hutvhinson begins her account of " Our 
Country Home '' (McClurg) which the man who had 
always wanted a farm, and the woman who had 
changed her mind about having a country house, 
together built and beautified. The forest which in- 
spired them was a bit of Wisconsin woodland along 
the shore of a lovely little lake. They bought seventy- 
two acres of it, and leaving all but a small part un- 
touched except for a roadway leading through it, 
planned a house and garden for the part bordering 
on the lake. An architect and a landscape gardener 
were calle<l in to draw up a general scheme, but the 
owners constituted themselves a consulting staff, in 
which was vested the final authority. They were in 
no hurry to finish their house; they realized that 
as a matter of fact it could never be finished, and 
that, if it should ever seem to be so. the fun would 
be over. Pictures of the house in its first and second 
years, of an upstairs porch before and after three 
years of vine culture, and of the formal gfarden in 
its various stages, show that a woodland home can- 
not be made, but must grow. The illustrations in 
the volume, which are made from photographs by 
the author, are a decided feature of interest. There 
are nearly two hundred of them, picturing the house 
from various vantage-points and showing many in- 
teresting bits of detail, practical as well as artistic. 
Mrs. Hutchinson tells her story most entertainingly, 
giving many suggestions to readers who are inter- 
ested in having country homes of their own. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson may be unfailingly relied upon 
to add a volume or two to each year's quota of illus- 
trated books, for which, with versatility unusual in 
these days of specialization he furnishes both text and 
illustrations. This year, instead of exploring some 
new field with note-book and camera, Mr. Johnson 
has chosen to revise and greatly enlarge two of his 
eai'ly volumes, first issued some ten years ago and 
now published as companion volumes by Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co. The titles are " The Farmer's 
Boy " and " The Country School." Mr. Johnson 
was a New England farmer's boy, and he firmly 
believes that there is more fun in being that particu- 
lar kind of boy than in being any other imaginable 
kind. His recollections are therefore pleasant, 
though not so rose-colored that they lack the note of 
reality. Readers who have had similar experiences 
will find Mr. Johnson a very competent conductor 
back to the happy land of childhood ; and those who 
have never been New England boys and girls — for 
Mr. Johnson finds it impossible to leave out the g^ls 



from the story — will enjoy the book just as much, 
since boys are boys the world over. The memories 
of district-school, based on Mr. Johnson's experiences 
and those of his friends, are also written informally, 
as the story of one child's school-days. Both books 
gain a unique interest from the fact that the life they 
picture is passing away ; district schools are being 
deserted, the telephone and the rural mail service 
have altered the distinctive tone of New England 
farm life, and it is now if ever that the record of the 
older period must be written. Mr. Johnson does not 
explain how he got his photographs of old-time boys 
and girls. Most likely he hunted out suitable sub- 
jects in some remote corner of rural New England. 
But however obtained, the pictures are certainly 
interesting and effective. 

Mrs. Lucy FitchPerkins assures us that she is aloyal 
Westerner, but her " Book of Joys " ( McClurg) tells of 
a spring and summer spent in two quaintNew England 
villages, in old houses of the sort that stand far back 
from the street, shaded by elms and pines, with lilac 
bushes along the front path and apple-trees, laden 
with flowers or fruit in season, in the back yard. 
Mrs. Perkins is keenly alive to both the delights and 
the limitations of the old-school New England life, 
seeing it with the clear eyes of an alien who is 
sympathetic to its charm but fully conscious of its 
whimsicalities and oddities. Being city-bred, Mrs. 
Perkins feels the lack of congenial society in the 
country, but with characteristic optimism she finds 
compensation in " a more intimate acquaintance with 
cats and dogs and other live-stock ; and," she adds, 
" if one agreed with the misanthropist who said that 
the more he saw of men the better he liked dogs, it 
might he considered a fair exchange." However, 
the neighborhood of Marston Hill is not a solitude. 
There are Cousin Henrietta and her husband, who 
own the place; there is Barney Bump, who helped 
buUd them a rustic pergola, expostulating, mean- 
while, that " it looked so wild you'd expect gorillars 
to come out on it any minute"; and there is the 
" little dove-colored lady " who had a distractingly 
beautiful old-fashioned garden, but whose ideas about 
Chicago temporarfly snapped the summer's speU of 
joy for Mrs. Perkins. And at the old homestead 
there were a Bride and Groom Elect, and a large 
family party gathered to attend their wedding, which 
furnishes a fitting climax to the summer's pleasures. 
Mrs. Perkins, being hitherto known rather as an 
artist than as an author, has naturally chosen to 
illustrate " A Book of Joys " herself, providing five 
full-page drawings in color, and for a cover design an 
inset colored picture of an elm-shaded farm-house. 
People who like old furniture and who like still 
better to go in pursuit of it and to discover it in the 
most unlikely places, will look far before finding a 
book so exactly to their taste as Robert and Elizabeth 
Shackleton's " The Quest of the Colonial " ( Century 
Co.). The volume is illustrated by many excellent 
and useful photographs of tj'pical styles of old 
furniture, brass, silver, etc., and is given a decora- 
tive touch by the addition of a colored frontispiece

and appropriate head and tail pieces cleverly drawn 
by Mr. Harry Fenn. It contains a great deal of 
definite and accurately stated information for the 
amateur collector, besides many anecdotes calculated 
to quicken his enthusiasm and arouse his envy and 
admiration. Mr. and Mrs. Shackleton went on 
exploring tours all through the East and South, and 
made many discoveries, some of which they bore 
home in triumph, while others, even finer, were left 
in the hands of too-avaricious dealers or too-wealthy 
rivals. But the true collector counts possession only 
one joy — though the crowning one — among the 
many that go to make up his experiences. Not the 
least of these are involved in the necessity of suitably 
housing his antiques, and not the least interest of 
Mr. and Mrs. Shackleton's book is the account it 
gives of their making over their house to tit the sort 
of furniture they preferred. Of course a book that 
touches upon so many branches of the large subject 
of " Antiques " cannot be exhaustive, but the begin- 
ner does not want exhaustive treatises ; he wants to 
be guided through the first stages of promiscuous 
buying. This is what Mr. and Mrs. Shackleton offer 
to do for him. Incidentally they give much encour- 
agement to the buyer of small means, assuring him 
that even the choicest specimens are within his 
reach if he knows where to go for them. 

Books on old furniture are having at the present 
time a vogue similar to that given to books on natural 
history a few years since. The subject, in its various 
relations to history and economics, and to the prin- 
ciples of art and construction, is one that admits 
of a great variety of treatment. A recent contri- 
butor to the literature of old furniture is Mr. Fred 
Roe, whose " Ancient Coffers and Cupboards," pub- 
lished in 1902, is now followed by " Old Oak Fur- 
niture " (McClurg). In this volume the author's 
interest in his subject is that of the antiquary, the 
collector, and the artist. His illustrations are fur- 
nished from his own drawings, including the beau- 
tiful frontispiece of a handsome sideboard in his 
possession, reproduced in color. His " Seventeenth- 
Century Chair," indexed to be shown on the title- 
page, however, appears to have been lost from the 
book, possibly in the American edition only. The 
author gives little in the way of scientific classifica^ 
tion, and enlightens his readers but little regarding 
the development of the various styles of domestic 
furniture, but wi'ites always with the collector in 
mind, ready to warn him against forgeries and other 
pitfalls which beset the path of lovers of old oak, 
and incidentally tells of certain traditions attached 
to some famous articles of furniture in the native 
English oak, which, in the hands of English work- 
men, assumed a distinctive character of its own 
about the time of Elizabeth. 

" Browning's Italy " is the somewhat misleading 
though intrinsically correct title of an interesting 
study of Italian life and art as it is interpreted in 
Browning's poetry. The book is written by Miss 
Helen Archibald Clarke, and published with a de- 
corative cover-design, fancy end-leaves, and some two 



dozen photographic illustrations of present-day Italy, 
by the Baker & Taylor Co. The fact is that Brown- 
ing's types are so vivid, and his situations so intensely 
dramatic, that the average reader has to think twice 
before he realizes that they belong to the Middle 
Ages, and that " Browning's Italy " means Italy of 
the Renaissance. Miss Clarke classifies Browning's 
Italian interests under five chapter-headings: The 
Dawn of the Renaissance, Glimpses of Political Life, 
The Italian Scholar, The Artist and His Art, and 
Pictures of Social Life. For each she supplies the 
needed background of history, connecting it with 
the poetry by liberal quotations, — a method which 
makes possible the extension of her audience beyond 
the limited circle of those who know Browning thor- 
oughly. On the other hand, the historical studies 
are complete enough to interest students of Browning, 
because of the new light they cast on the sources of 
his love for Italy and on the relation between the 
historic facts of the records and his poetic inter- 
pretation of them. 

A whimsical bibelot, which may be counted upon 
to please fastidious readers, both in substance and 
mechanical features, is Mrs. Anna Benneson Mc- 
Mahan's " Shakespeare's Gift to Queen Bess " 
(McClurg). It relates in a simple vivid style that 
gets a quaint coloring from the archaic type, the 
story of the court presentation of " Midsummer 
Night's Dream " before Queen Elizabeth in the 
Christmas revels at Whitehall Palace in 1596. 
Mrs. McMahan handles her story with a light touch 
that deftly conceals much genuine erudition. Her 
treatment is fanciful and suggestive, but at the same 
time has an air of verisimilitude that takes her read- 
ers back to the Mermaid Tavern, crowded on a Club 
night, and to the Queen's Palace, decked for a festi- 
val and thronged with Elizabethan lords and ladies. 
There are many pretty illustrations picturing the 
setting of the tale, and the cover-design is a unique 
conception. 

Among all the holiday books of the season none 
is more thoroughly artistic in binding, decoration, 
and make-up than " Gods and Heroes of Old Japan " 
(Lippincott). Miss Ada Galton is responsible for 
the decorative features, and Miss Violet M. Pasteur 
for the text. This latter consists of short stories 
taken from the sacred writings and ancient histories 
of Japan. Some are legendary and miraculous; 
others correspond to the tales of our own age of 
chivalry. They are simply and gracefully told, 
with a quaintness that suits the primitive type of 
the stories. The wide page margins are decorated 
in tint, with a great variety of graceful floral designs 
and with odd little figures in attitudes that are fuU 
of meaning and suggestion. Many of these sketches 
are after Hokusai and other old masters. There 
are also four full-page drawings in color, — one of 
them, "The Iris Page," being perhaps the crown- 
ing feature of the book. Decorated end-leaves and 
an attractively designed cover complete a book sure

University of California. The Macmillan Co. publish

A third edition, revised and enlarged, of Mr. R. A. 
Streatfeild's historical work on " The Opera " has just 
been published by the J. B. Lippincott Co. This very 
readable and trustworthy book may be commended to 
all lovers of music who wish to know something about 
the great works of the lyric stage. 

The Dalmatian coast is one of the most interesting 
parts of Europe, and is as yet comparatively imspoiled 
by the tourist. It will not long remain so if many books 
are published about it as charming, both in text and illus- 
tration, as Mrs. Maude M. Holbach's "Dalmatia: The 



Land Where East Meets West" One can hardly glance 
over these fifty or more plates without at once being 
seized with a wild desire to start upon an Adriatic trip. 

" Little Eyolf," " John Gabriel Borkman," and " When 
We Dead Awaken " are the three plays comprised within 
the eleventh (and concludmg) volume of Mr. Archer's 
uniform edition of Ibsen in English. In the last-named

" mental breakdown " which it never occurred to us to 
detect. Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are the pub- 
lishers of this edition. 

The Open Court Publishing Co. send us an ingenious 
satire on agnosticism, by Dr. Paul Cams. It is entitled

sort of primer of Buddhism, entitled " The Dharma," 
which includes an exposition of the "religion of enlighten- 
ment," and an anthology of " Gems of Buddhist Poetry." 

The John Lane Co. publish an illustrated edition, in 
a single large volume, of " The Poems of Coleridge." 
Mr. Ernest Hartley Coleridge provides an introductiwi. 
The order of the poems is chronological. A few pieces, 
still under copyright, are not included, but on the other 
hand, the present volume contains a few unimportant 
poems now collected for the first time. As for Mr. 
Gerald Metcalfe's illustrations, we may say of them that 
they are interesting, but in no way extraordinary.

THE HOLLY-TREE INN

A CHRISTMAS TREE 





By CHARLES DICKENS 

With illustrations in color and line by George Alfred Williams. $2.00.

strated in the first two issues, 
" Mr. Pickwick's Christmas " and " A 
Christmas Carol " and " The Cricket 
on The Hearth." Suffice it to say 

that this new volume is the most attractive of the three, and that its 
spirited appeal to the Christmas impulses will make it one of the 
notable Holiday books of the season.

THU WHIT TIER CENTENARY. 



When the hard-pressed Spartans sent to 
Athens for a leader at the time of the Mes- 
senian war, they were not a little surprised 
when there came to them, instead of the soldier 
they expected, a lame schoolmaster. But his 
songs proved more potent than strategy, and 
so inspired them that they won their cause. 
No less striking an adjustment of unexpected 
means to unforeseen ends is found in the history 
of our own great national conflict which issued 
in the triumph of human liberty. It was of 
Emerson that Lowell wrote : " To him more 
than to aU other causes together did the young 
martyrs of our Ci\Tl War owe the sustaining 
strength of thoughtful heroism that is so touch- 
ing in every record of their lives." But the 
words fit Whittier almost as well, and the in- 
spiring influence of our Quaker Tyrtaeus, even 
more directly than the spiritual counsels of our 
Puritan sage, kindled the fires of devotion that 
' consumed our fortress of vested wronff. It is 
j highly significant for the spiritual interpretation 
I of the Civil War that its outcome shoidd be 
1 so largely attributable to these two men, both 
i having the temperament of the recluse, and 
both forced by the pressure of events to come 
out into the open and address plain speech to 
their fellow-men upon the commanding prac- 
tical question of their time. We celebrated 
the Emerson centenary four years ago ; to-day, 
fifteen years after his death, we celebrate the 
centenary of John Greenleaf Whittier. 

It was years before Emerson said, " There 
is an infamy in the air," that Whittier — 
Quaker and man of peace — took the militant 
attitude toward the institution of slavery. In 
the early thirties, when Emerson was still rather 
repelled by the vehemence of the reformers, 
Whittier had allied himself with Garrison, and 
enlisted for the war. 

" My heart both leaped to answer thine, 
And echo back thy words. 
As leaps the warrior's at the shine 
And flash of kindred swords." 

And from that time on, until the breaking of the 
storm-cloud of war, he was outspoken and 
uncompromising in his stand for righteousness, 
although still trying hard to reconcile the need

for action with the spirit of non-resistance. 
Lowell pictures him in 1848 as 

" Both singing and striking in front of the war. 
And hitting his foes with the mallet of Thor," 

and others than Lowell must have wonderingly 

" O leather-clad Fox, 
Can that be thy son, in the battle's mad din. 
Preaching brotherly love and then driving it in 
To the brain of the tough old Goliath of sin. 
With the smoothest of pebbles from Caataly's spring 
Impressed on his hard moral sense with a sling '! " 

And so for more than thirty years, and until 
the end of the war was in sight, he fought 
stoutly on, and was at last free to raise the paean 
of his " Laus Deo." 

" Ring and swing. 
Bells of joy I On morning's wing 

Send the song of praise abroad ! 
With a soimd of broken chains 
Tell the nations that He reigns 

Who alone is Lord and God ! " 

When the long conflict was over, and the 
political passion that had hitherto inspired his 
song had achieved its aim, Whittier found his 
intimate self once more, and became what Nature 
had all along meant him to be — the poet of his 
own native section. " Snow- Bound " and " The 
Tent on the Beach " are the works by which 
he is likely to live the longest, because of the 
sincerity and fidelity with which they picture 
what is now a fast- vanishing phase of American 
civilization. They are the pieces which make him 
peculiarly the poet of New England, and justify 
Parkman's exact description : " His genius drew 
its nourishment from her soil ; his pages are the 
mirror of her outward nature, and the strong 
utterance of her inward life." The course of 
the twentieth century will carry New England 
far from those conditions of primitive simplicity 
which made a poet like Whittier possible, and 
that body of his work which enshrines for pos- 
terity the old homely life which nurtured him 
will grow increasingly precious as that life, with 
all its accidents, recedes into the past. 

Among Whittier's titles to our gratitude two 
have been considered — his championship of the 
cause of freedom and his industry as a chron- 
icler of New England life and legend. A third 
chief title is based upon his religious poems. 
The atmosphere of Puritanism in which he grew 
up was tonic but harsh, and needed the soft- 
ening breath of airs from some milder source 
of spiritual refreshment. The principles of 
Quakerism supplied just this need, and produced 
in Whittier the fortunate blend of strength and 
gentleness, of austerity and tolerance, that made 
his religious utterances so singularly appealing. 
He had the vision of the 



" One faith alone, so broad that all mankind 
Within themselves its secret witness find, 
The soul's communion with the Eternal Mind," 

and in many a simple and touching strain he 
impaii«d that vision to restless souls seeking 
after peace. There is nothing that is offen- 
sively dogmatic in his religious verse, only the 
pure gold of aspiration for the good and faith 
in its ultimate realization. 

It is safe to say that Whittier's fame as a 
poet has steadily brightened during the years 
since his death. There was a time when criti- 
cism viewed him with a supercilious air, dwell- 
ing upon his perfectly obvious limitations, his 
lack of fuiish, his defect of ear, and the general 
crudity of many of his improvisations. These 
things obscured the critical vision, and pre- 
vented his entire work from being seen in its 
true perspective. We do not now dwell upon 
them so much, because his qualities of positive 
excellence are seen to be more deserving of 
attention. He has been variously compared 
to Crabbe, Cowper, and Burns, and even to 
Tennyson. The comparisons may not be close, 
but the fact that he suggests thepi at all is 
significant. The faithful and minute realism of 
his New England descriptive pieces more than 
confirms the likeness with Crabbe, and the 
lyrical quality of Burns, his acknowledged 
master, is echoed in many of his New England 
songs and ballads. It was a Southern poet, Paul 
Hayne, who spoke of his verse as " rhythmic 
gold," and compared him with the poet of " The 
Task " in this quatrain : 

" Grod's innocent pensioners in the woodland dim. 
The fields, the pastures, know and trust in him, 
And in their love, his lonely heart is blest, 
Our pure hale-minded Cowper of the West." 

As for Tennyson, if Whittier touches him at all, 
it is upon the idyllic side, and also in a few 
rare flashes of spiritual insight. We have often 
thought that the closing stanzas of " Burning 
Drift- Wood " would not suffer greatly if set in 
comparison even with the faultless stanzas of 
" Crossing the Bar." Here they are, ready for 
the touch-stone. 

" I hear the solemn monotone 
Of waters calling unto me, 
I know from whence the airs have blown 
That whisper of the Eternal Sea. 

" As low my fires of drift-wood burn, 

I hear that sea's deep sounds increase. 
And, fair in sunset light, discern 
Its mirage-lifted Isles of Peace." 

One word more, and this centennial tribute 
shall end. What have the younger poets 
learned of thee ? is the question once put by 



1907.]

But more significant than this incisive sxmi-

also the prophet. All true poets are prophets 
in some degrees, but few wear the robes with 
Whittier's dignity. It is the authentic accent 
of prophecy that we hear in " Ichabod " — as 
noble a poem as any of Hugo's " Chatiments " — 
and in the •' Centennial Hymn '" whose stately 
measures embody a rational ideal not likely to 
become outworn.

SOME FRIENDSHIPS OF WHITTIER. 

WITH LETTEES HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED. 



Among the centenary thoughts on Whittier, 
impressed upon us by re-reading his published letters 
and listening to scattered reminiscences, has been a 
realization of the large and varied circle of friends 
who were recipients of his sympathetic and loyal 
good-will. With his contemporaries in literature, 
who are ranked to-day among the greater authors, 
he did not maintain cordial and free relations. In 
his young manhood he lacked educational and social 
opportunities to form such bonds of friendship; in 
later life, his mingled shyness and ill-health pre- 
vented him from accepting many friendly invitations 
that came to him. For Emerson and Longfellow 
and Lowell he had great admiration, but he was 
reserved and sometimes ill at ease in their company. 
In the last decade of his life he exchanged cordial 
notes of congratidation with Holmes, as they shared 
successive birthdays with their honors. With three 
men of lettei-s he was on more intimate tenns of 
friendship, — Edwin P. Whipple, Bayard Taylor, 
and James T. .Fields. 

For the women winters who came to him often for 
advice and encouragement, he had warm regai'd, and 
his letters to them show real cordiality and often 
humorous responsiveness. His friendship with Lucy 
Larcom and Abigail Dodge ("Gail Hamilton") 
was expressed in many letters and in hours of hos- 
pitality at his Amesbury home. He was deeply 
interested in the literary achievements of two women 
who are still writing graceful prose and verse, Mrs. 
Harriet Prescott SpofEord and Miss Sarah Orne 
Jewett The former was his neighbor, when at her 



home near Newburyport, and with her and her 
husband Whittier had relations of true friendship. 
He acknowledged indebtedness to Mrs. Spofford for 
the germ-ideas of two of his poems, "The King's 
Missive " and "The Captain's Well." Mrs. Spofford 
offered the story of Captain Valentine Bagley and 
his well to Whittier before she wrote her poem, 
believing that "all the legends of the countiyside 
belonged to him," but he did not then intend to use 
this story. The letter following, loaned by Mrs. 
Spofford and never before published, was written in 
1882, after the publication of her verses ; the tribute 
which Whittier paid to her poem may be applied 
also to his later rendering of the same tradition. 

« Oak Kaoll, Danven, 
8mo., 17, 1882. 

" Mt dear Mrs. Spofford : 

" I had the pleasure of meeting thy best friend in 
the cars the other day, and he told me that a copy of 
thy Valentine Bagley poem had been sent to me. I 
searched my great pile of papers for it, but failed to 
find it until very lately. I have read it with the hearti- 
est satisfaction. The touching and beautiful story could 
not be better told. It is worth ten thousand dollars to 
Amesbury, and would be cheap at that, if thee had not 
given it to us. It has made the old well immortal. It 
has indissolubly wedded Powow River and the Merri- 
mack with the Sea of Oman and the Cove of Muscat. 
Between the boughs of Daniel Himtington's apple-trees 
the date-palms of Arabia will wave and rustle forever." 

Miss Jewett was associated in Whittier's life with 
those other friends, Mr. and Mrs. James T. Fields. 
Her stories of New England life gfave him rare 
pleasure. Miss Jewett has allowed the publication 
of one of his letters to her which reveals his constant 
sympathy for his friends. Miss Jewett was visiting 
Mrs. Fields in Boston at this time. 

" Amesbury, Ist mo., 14, 1886. 

" My dear frlend : 

" I wonder whether you know in Charles street how 
cold it is ! The world seems freezing up, — another 
ice-period is upon us. We are 18 degrees below zero 
here this morning. It must be terribly hard for the 
poor in your city. If it were not for such angels of 
mercy as our dear Annie Fields and her associates, 
what would become of them ? 

" I enclose a long notice of thy writings by the literary 
editor of the Providence Daily Jotu-nal, Kate H. Austin, 
a Quaker friend of mine. If it gives thee half the 
pleasure it has given me, I shall be satisfied. 

" Don't let . . . risk her life too much this terrible 
weather. I have been thinking of her daily outgoings 
ever since this awful wave of cold has rolled upon us. 
With a great deal of love for her, I am thy affectionate 
friend, Johjj G. WHrmER. 

" Please hand the enclosed check to A. F. I want, in 
my small way, to share in her work, or if possible to 
relieve a little of the suffering she is obliged to witness." 

One of the memorable friendships of Whittier 
with another poet came in his later years, when Paul 
Hamilton Hayne paid the visits to Longfellow and 
Whittier which he has described in " The Snow- 
Messengers." After that day at Danvers, in 1879,

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



the two poets, once so diametrically opposed in 
political faith, became friends whose correspond- 
ence gave mutual pleasure. Mr. William Hamilton 
Hayne has permitted the use of two letters from 
Whittier to his father which are revelatory and 
gracious. The first is dated November, 1880. 

"It is nearly a year ago since thee and dear Mrs. 
Hayne were here. I was wishing this morning that 
you could see our trees, which Autumn has painted 
more gloriously than ever before. How do you do ? 
The newspapers say thy health is better, but we were 
pained to hear of thy illness some months ago. For 
myself, I am feeling the effects of age : — am rarely 
free from pain, and find all writing and serious thought 
very wearisome. I realize that there is little left for 
me but to trust and wait. . . . Yet I am thankful for 
the many blessings, — for friends, for books, for the 
ever beautiful natiu-e, and hope that, despite of many 
errors and shortcomings, I have not lived wholly in vain. 
The poetical temperament has its trials and keen suscep- 
tibdity to the hard, harsh, and milovely things of life; 
but, my dear friend, we have also a capacity for enjoy- 
ment which others do not know, — ' the still air and 
deUghtful studies,' the glow and enthusiasm of rhythmic 
utterance, and the rapturous love of all beauty and har- 
mony. And as Holmes says, ' It is a satisfaction some- 
times to sit under a tree and read our own songs. . . . 
The election is at hand. However it goes, I hope the 
country will not suffer. I long for peace and kindly 
feeling." 

After the death of Longfellow, Whittier wrote to 
Hayne : 

" Ever since our great poet fell asleep, I have wanted 
to write thee, but I have scarcely courage or strength 
for the effort. I heard from my dear Mrs. Fields, who 
had visited him, that he was wishing to see me. As 
soon as I was able I went out from Uoston on the Sun- 
day of his last week. His daughter told nie he had 
been taken suddenly ill the night before, and it was not 
possible for him to see me or anyone. I was greatly 
grieved, but 1 hoped he was not seriously ill. He was 
more comfortable afterward but no permanent restora- 
tion. The last two days of his life he slept much and 
seemed quiet. And so he passed as from one lower cham- 
ber to one higher. Ah me! but the world seems the less 
for his leaving. And a feeling of great loneliness op- 
presses me. ... I should have answered thy last letter 
but for illness and weakness. I am so dreadfully 
oppressed by my correspondence with strangers that I 
cannot do justice to my friends. My letters for the 
last six mouths have been at the rate of twenty a day." 

In his earlier and later years alike, Whittier had 
many friends among the Quakers whose faith he 
always maintained, while he was ever open-minded 
toward all creeds. He was interested in the scientific 
research and discussions which were wide-spread 
during the later decades of his life. In 1879 an 
English Quaker, Stanley Pumphrey, visited Whittier 
at Oak Knoll, with some friends of the poet, Pliny 
and Thomas Chase. To his guests he spoke freely 
of his religious experiences and hopes. A record of 
the conversation was kept in a diary, from which I 
am privileged to quote these exti'acts. Referring to 
the seeming conflict between science and religion, 
Whittier said : 



" I am surprised at the anxiety of some religious 
teachers with regard to the effect of scientific investiga- 
tions. We must never be afraid of truth, and, more 
than that, truth can never conti'adict itself. Even 
evolution, if that can be proved, would not affect the 
doctrines we have been talking of " 

In the same conversation Whittier spoke with 
earnest interpretation of the motives which suggested 
to him his poem on "The Eternal Goodness." 

" It was directed against the Calvinistic teaching in 
the midst of which I was brought up. Some of my 
friends have felt uneasy with that poem. It has sur- 
prised me very much that they should be. I am sure 
it came from my heart. I sometimes heard teachers 
that represented God as a tormentor. This wounded 
me I felt that I would not love the God who was 
thus depicted. It seemed to shut me up in a selfish 
love as though I must just love Him for what He gave 
me, or what I hoped that He would give. This did not 
satisfy me. I wanted to love Him for Himself. Charles 
Kingsley told me how he passed through the same strug- 
gle, how he and his wife would he awake agonizing, 
because they could not love God, being what they 
imagined Him to be. Through a severe and paurful 
struggle I have learned to have larger hopes for the race 
than I once entertained. I do not think thatGod's love for 
His creatui-es ever ceases, or that probation closes with 
the grave. This view seems to me the necessary conse- 
quence of our retaining our personality in the other life. 
Giod will not in the resurrection make us mere automata. 
We must have the exercise of free-will, the power of 
choice, or we cease to be ourselves. I sympatliise with 
the old divine who maintained that, if even the devil 
would repent, God would forgive him. But do not thiuk 
I wish to detract from the force of our Saviour's ex- 
pressions. I accept them. I can see the possibility of 
eternal punishment. I believe it would be the inevitable 
result of eternal rebellion. The penalty must follow 
sin ; we see it in this life. I am thankful for the altered 
teaching of the present day. Friends have had their 
share in counteracting Calvinistic views.' 

These unstudied utterances well express the deeply 
religious faith which was so large a part of Whittier's 
nature, and are an interesting commentary on the 
notable poem to which they refer.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Books that are hard to classify are nnmerons 
enough, heaven knows (or at any rate librarians know), 
without the addition of literary hoaxes and other 
masked, disguised, hybrid, or nondescript products of 
the writer's art. Among recent puzzlers of this sort to 
which the President of the American Library Associa- 
tion has called attention are "■ The Letters of a Chinese 
Official," "As the Hague Ordains," and "Indiscreet 
Letters from Pekin." To a cataloguer, at first glance, 
or even at second and third glance, these are all serious, 
trnth-telling books; but to the intelligent reader, with 
more time to study them than the over-worked cata- 
loguer can command, they are nothing but fiction painted 
over with a more or less thick coating of plausibility and 
loeal color. The " make-up " of the ' Chmese Official " 
was so deceptive as to move a certain eminent public 
man to write, and almost to publish, a serious rejoinder 
in the form of a solemn defense of Christianity and 
Western civilization ; but in the nick of time he learned 
diat the Chinaman was bom in England and had never 
worn a pigtaiL Books, too, that deal with inventions 
of the future or wars of the twenty -first centnry are a 
thorn in the cataloguer's flesh. They flout Mr. Dewey 
and his decimal system, and laugh to scorn Mr. Cutter 
and his ejcpansive classification. The decimal scheme 
should* have been made a duodecimal, or better a quin- 
qoedecimal or octodecimal one; the expansive system 
would need a more than India-rubber elasticity to in- 
clude all the whimsical creations of an author's brain. 
For a private reader, in the seclusion of his own study, 
to have been deceived by one of these masqueraders, is 
humiliating enough; but for a professional cataloguer 
to have placed his gullibility on public record in a 
printed catalogue, or even in a card-catalogue, tends to 
lessen the joy of living.

The uteratctse of taxatiox, if tax bills and 
tax-collectors' books can be called literature, contains 
some quaint and curious reading. Certain ancient 
documents belonging by inheritance to a Boston business 
man have been brought to light and made to show how 
taxes were assessed and collected in the latter part of 
the eighteenth century, when the metropolis of Xew 
England was still under town government. A tax bill 
of 1780, made out against one William Dodd, who 
owned no real estate, charges him with a tax on " pei^ 
sonal estate and faculty " to the amount of 26Z, 17«, &d — 
for town and coimty. His state tax on the same items 
was 12/, 18*, Ad. His state poll tax was twenty pounds 
sterling ! And his town and county poll tax, forty 
pounds and ten shillings ! ! Total, 1001, a*, lOd. Yk 
the IhII is neither crumpled nor torn, nor does it other- 



wise display marks of indiguation or anger. The citizen 
of that day was required, in terms probably more amus- 
ing to us than to him, to state the number of ratable 
polls in his family, sixteen years old and upward to 
twenty-one years, and the number of polb of other and 
curious varieties; the number of his dwelling-houses, 
shops, distilleries, sugar-houses, bake-houses, tan-booses, 
slaughter and other houses; of his pot and peail-Mii 
works, iron works, furnaces, rope-walks, grist and full- 
ing mills, saw and slitting mills, and all other mills of 
whatever description; also the number of ounces of 
silver plate in his possessicHi, the acreage of his araUe 
lands and of his orchards, his stock of wheat, rye, oats, 
barley, Indian com, peas, and beans, his acreage of fresh 
meadow and salt marsh and every other conceivable 
variety of land; and so on to inconceivable length. 
Finally the climax was reached in a demand to know 
the number of his " cow rights " and how many barrels 
of "cyder" his whole estate yielded annually. We 
read little about tax-dodgers in those virtuous days, bnt 
the filling out of such a schedule as is here indicated 
must have tried the patience and tested the honesty of 
William Dodd and his neighbors.

The particularttt or library statistics is 
becoming so minute as to impress the obi«erver with 
the painstaking vigilance of librarians and asalstante. 
Sometimes, indeed, a gentle amusement is aroused by 
the ingenuity displayed in this department of library 
lore, and the outsider wonders what new task will next 
be imposed upon the indefatigable statistician. The 
public library of Hartford, Conn., has begun to keep 
count of the questions propounded in its reference room, 
and now announces a gain of 1156 such queries over laat 
year, the present year's total falling little short of k 
myriad, without including inquiries for books, maps, 
and other publications kept in the room. Here, too, 
the contestants in 112 debates were furnished with 
ammunition for their argumentative encounters, and the 
department at all times has been crowded with infor- 
mation seekers from every walk of life. Useful appli- 
cations of, or fruitful deductions from, these as yet rath^ 
dry statistics are to be hoped for some day. There is 
brought to mind, by the way, a certain library whose head 
conceived the idea of having his subordinates keep a re- 
cord of all books applied for unsueeessf ully, — name of 
book and name of disi^pointed applicant to be in each 
case put down in black and white. Though such a record 
might have furnished an illustration, more impressive 
than Johnson's poem, of the vanity of human wishes, 
to require it to be kept was asking too much of library- 
assistant human nature, and a curious chapter was thus 
lost to the literature of libnuy statisties.

Interestixg facts about younger sojre aijd

Dr. Louise G. Rabinovitch of Xew York before the late 
International Congress on Psychiatry, at Amsterdam. 
After studying the hves of seventy-^our great men and 
women — poets and prose- writers, politicians, painters, 
and musicians — Dr. Rabinovitch reports that only teo 
of the number were first-bom children, while a great 
majority of these seventy-four persons of genius were 
youngest or neit-to-the-youngest children. For instaiice, 
Coleridge was the last-bom of thirteen children, James 
Fenimore Cooper the eleventh of twelve children, 
Washington Irving the youngest of eleven, Balzac the 
youngest of three, George Qiot the youngest of four.

Napoleon an eighth and probably youngest child, Daniel 
Webster the youngest of seven, Benjamin Franklin the 
seventeenth child of his parents and the last-born chihl 
of the last-bom child for several generations back, 
Rembrandt the last of six, Rubens of seven, Landseer 
the fifth of seven children, Reynolds a seventh child, 
Weber a ninth, Wagner the yoimgest of seven, Mozart 
the same, Schubert the thirteenth of fourteen, Schumann 
the last-bom of five. The prominent part played here 
by the sacred seven is noticeable. Moreover, since 
maturity in the parents seems to be necessary for the 
production of children of geniiis, have we not here 
indicated a sphere of usefulness for L)r. Osier's effete 
quadragenarians ? A reading of Dr. Rabinovitch's list 
makes one wish he might have chosen, not so much his 
parents as the order of his birth; but if all were to 
choose to be youngest sons or daughters, an obvious 
difficulty would present itself, comparable with that of 
the Irishman's railway train which should insure condi- 
tions of safety by having no first or last cars attached. 
Statistics, however, let it be recalled in closing, can be 
made to pi-ove almost anything; and it would doubtless 
be an easy matter to draw up a list of first-born men 
and women of genius — which also would be interesting 
reading. . . . 

John Harvard's benefaction seems to be held in 
rather slight esteem by at least one of the thousands 
of his livuig beneficiaries. Mr. Frank B. Sanborn, a 
loyal son of the University, shows the courage of his 
convictions in refusing to join the general chorus of 
praise. He is reported as saying, and with a good deal 
of reason when one calmly considers the matter, that 
Harvard " has had Ids full share of posthumous honor 
for what was at best but a small contribution to the 
triumph of civiUzation, while other men who did more 
have been honored less, or, more politely speaking, have 
far sui-passed Harvard in the value of their counsels 
and donations." Harvard's bequest of £700 and liis 
library to the infant college came when the school was 
already established by legislative enactment and appro- 
priation, so that no founder's honors are properly his; 
nor does his gift impress the present generation by 
reason of its size. But it was timely; and because the 
testator had the good fortiuie to die at the " psycholog- 
ical moment " in the struggling institution's existence, 
he stepped into an imperishable renown. We live in 
an unjust world, and the prizes are never awarded with 
exaet equity; but perhaps, in this instance, instead of 
seeking to honor John Harvard less we might better 
strive to honor Mr. Sanborn's " other men " more. 

The unveiling of Zola's monument in Paris 
brings to light a pathetic incident that caused the death 
of its sculptor, Constantine Meunier, and that might well 
be made the theme of some powerful novel or drama or 
poem. Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Zola him- 
self might have treated it effectively. The celebrated 
Belgian sculptor, as we learn through his collaborator, 
M. Alexandre Charpentier, was devoted to his children. 
He had two sons, the older thirty years of age, the 
younger twenty-eight. One of them, of delicate con- 
stitution, had recently died, of tuberculosis; the other, 
who had entered the army, was absent in French Guiana. 
Only a few days after the death of the son at home the 
father received a long telegram announcing the sad fate 
of the other, who had died of a fever that commonly 
proves mortal to Europeans in tropical lands. Then 
followed a tragic experience for the father : for six weeks 



he kept receiving letters from the young captain who — 
so sudden had been his end — continued to the last de- 
scribing the life about him and giving animated ex- 
pression to his high hopes for the future. Under this 
refinement of torture, Memiier developed tendencies to 
heart-disease, and finally succumbed. In all this there 
is something of the grim horror of Greek tragedy.

A nonagenarian's birthday that should not pass 
without due notice was that of the Honorable, or we 
might fitly say the Right Honorable, John Bigelow, man 
of many books and many honors, who first saw light on 
the 2oth Nov., 1817. Graduated at eighteen from 
Union College, admitted to the bar a little later, ap- 
pointed inspector of Sing Sing prison at twenty-eight, 
holding an editorial position on the New Yoi-k " Evening 
Post " in the important decade (it was a duodecade, how- 
ever) 1849-61, U. S. Consul at Paris during most of 
the Civil War, Minister to France from 1864 to 1867, 
Secretary of State of New York in the middle seventies, 
friend and biographer of Samuel J. Tilden and co- 
worker with him in politics, president now of the board 
of trustees of the New York Public Library, a trustee 
of the Metropolitan Art Museum, member of the his- 
torical societies of New York, Massachusetts, and Mary- 
land, editor of Franklin's works, author of a life of 
Bryant and of other books, and still so busy with his pen 
that he was forced to work over-time to acknowledge the 
birthday tributes he received from his many friends, — 
surely such a man need not wait till he is dead to be 
accounted happy. • . . 

The Whistler house at Lowell, Mass., has been 
bought by the Lowell Art Association and is to serve 
as the local headquarters of those who are interested in 
art and literature. Tliis manufacturing city, although 
it mamtains a good school of industrial arts, has never 
been regarded as a seat of culture. Whistler himself 
seems not to have been over-proud of liis birthplace. 
" Can any good thing come out of Lowell ? " might have 
been the irritating query, had he advertised the fact of 
his being born there The immediate cause of the pur- 
chase was the Art Association's need of a suitable place 
for holding a projected course of lectures; and -though 
it is glad to have acquired the celebi-ated artist's boy- 
hood home, it by no means wishes the house to be 
regarded as merely a Whistler memorial. " It is a 
memorial incidentally only," declares one who is deeply 
interested in the movement; " first of all, it is the home 
from which a small band of enthusiastic lovers of the finer 
things hope one day to exert a needful influence for good 
in a community hitherto dependent too largely on Boston 
for its intellectual pleasiu'es." The house is commodious, 

and has great possibilities to the artist's eye.

M.RS. Humphry Ward in French costume is not 
always immediately recognizable. With the beginning 
of her " Diana Mallory " in serial form there comes to 
our notice a French translation of " The Marriage of 
William Ashe " under the much altered title, " L'Erreur 
d'Aimer." To the novel-readers of France it is " the 
history of a young woman, romantic and whimsical, 
who by her disconcerting caprices scandalizes the 
drawing-rooms of London society, and who, irresistibly 
impelled by an inexorable destiny, rushes onward to the 
final catastrophe." It is probable that to most English- 
speaking readers of the book it is likewise rather the 
story of the brilliant and erratic wife's escapades than 
of the sedate, solidly-endowed, long-suffering husband's 
hopeless struggle against an unkind fate.

The Lefe Story of a True Americax.* 



It is the fashion of many in these days to 
draw gloomy pictures of the ruin that awaits 
the Republic at the hands of the European 
immigrant. Doubtless the steerage of every 
trans- Atlantic liner brings in indi\nduals des- 
tined to be of no material service, if not of 
positive injury, in the work of building up a 
self-governing people ; but at the worst it must 
be admitted that we can match from the native- 
bom product the most dangerous elements ever 
discovered in our importations from beyond the 
seas. There is a bright as well as a forbidding 
side to the subject, and it is well to consider 
once in a while some of the genuine contributions 
which the immigrant vessel has not infrequently 
made to the very highest tj-pes of the various 
phases of American citizenship. 

Carl Schurz was too effective a fighter for 
any cause which appealed to his judgment and 
conscience to get through this world without 
making enemies and subjecting himself to harsh 
and partisan judgment, even at the hands of 
many well-meaning people. His entrance into 
the field of American politics came at a period 
when the habit of exaggerated partisanism had 
been fastened upon the country by the acerbities 
growing out of the .slavery question, and the 
effect of the Civil War was to maintain that 
habit among the masses, with but slightly dimin- 
ished force, throughout his life. But it was not 
in his nature to submit his own judgment and 
conscience to partisan leadership. Xo measiire 
whatever coiUd coimt on his support merely 
because it had the stamp of party approval, nor 
was his political thinking ever of that hazy type 
which tends to confuse party with country. 
Indeed, the first experiences of his budding 
manhood had taught him that country itself, in 
so far as country is identical with governmental 
organization, may go radically wrong, and that 
ideal citizenship must look still deeper for its 
ultimate standards. Of course a man who 
plants himself on a moral rock of that kind is 
" impracticable '" to the average politician, who 
finds sand a more workable material than solid 
rock in more ways than one. And, sad to say, 
too many of us who have had experience enough 
to know better are always ready to accept the 
interested politician's estimate when such a man 
comes into view. And yet with all the bitter

criticism which Mr. Schurz's militant political 
; independence has again and again called forth, 
there are few to-day who would seriously gainsay 
his title to a conspicuous place in the highest 
ranks of intelligent and patriotic American 
citizenship, during the fifty years of his partici- 
pation therein. 

The romantic siiory of his part in the abortive 
revolutionary movement of 1848, his successful 
escape after defeat, and his daring penetration 
back into Prussian territory for the rescue from 
imprisonment of his old friend Professor Kinkel, 
has been bandied about by the press so often 
that few have not met with its main facts gar- 
nished up in one style or another ; but no art 
of fiction could improve on his own detailed 
relation of the fact£, in the first of the two vol- 
umes before us. We shall attempt no epitome 
of a romance too good to be broken, and merely 
remark that nothing less than a courageous and 
unflagging advocate of personal and political 
liberty could grow out of such a youth as is 
here pictured. 

It was no mere chance that brought such a 
young man as Schurz to America in the decade 
preceding our Civil War. He was bom for 
American citizenship, and nothing short of the 
most perverse interference with the eternal fit- 
ness of things could have kept him permanently 
out of this birthright. The revolutionary move- 
ments of Europe in 1848 were premature, so 
far as anything more than a mere seed-sowing 
for an indefinite future was concerned ; but in 
America a struggle was in progress into which 
youthful idealism could throw its strength and 
enthusiasm with reasonable grounds for hope 
of early and substantial results. The funda- 
mental principles of liberty were already im- 
bedded in the United States Constitution, and 
the question at issue was, in the last analysis, 
what to do with an institution radically at 
! variance with the essential character and the 
successful working of that document. German- 
American citizens were already numerous and 
influential in various parts of the Union, but 
the "Native American *' movement, with various 
subsidiary causes, had led the majority of them 
to afiBliate with the Democratic party. Schurz 
I reached America in 1852, and was fairly get- 
ting his bearings in the land of his adoption 
when the wreck of the Whig party cleared the 
i way for the formation of a new organization 
capable of considering the slavery question free 
from the trammel of past alliances and working 
i its way steadily towards a permanent solution,

promises with which the Clays and Websters 
and Calhouns of the immediately preceding era 
had sought to keep their constituents quiet. 
Naturally, Schurz threw in his lot with the new 
movement, and proved a very effective worker 
in detaching German voters of the Northern 
States from their former Democratic allegiance. 
It has always been recognized that the German 
element in Missouri was one of the most pow- 
erfid influences in holding that State in the 
Union; and for the fact that this vote was so 
strongly massed on the right side when the crisis 
came, much credit is due to the efforts of Mr. 
Schurz. 

By the year 1868 his effectiveness on the 
stump was so well recognized that he was 
invited into Illinois to take part in the great 
Lincoln-Douglas campaign, and here began the 
acquaintance which led Lincoln to so high an 
opinion of the young German's character and 
ability that three years later he insisted upon 
sending him as Minister to Spain, in spite 
of his foreign birth, his record as an anti- 
monarchical revolutionist, his less than a decade 
of American citizenship, and the active opposi- 
tion of the Secretary of State. He himself 
asserts that the President would have been 
wise to heed such objection ; but he proved 
thoroughly efficient during the short time that 
he held the position, and Secretary Seward 
declared himself well pleased with his services. 
As might have been expected, however, a life of 
comparative ease in Madrid could not satisfy 
his ideas of duty when once the country be- 
came involved in what was evidently to be a 
long and bloody struggle for existence. He 
took the first plausible opportunity to ask for 
permission to return to Washington on a fur- 
lough, and then persuaded the President to ac- 
cept his resignation from the diplomatic service 
and send him to the front. That his services as 
an officer in the army were intelligent, effective, 
and faithful in every way, will hardly be denied 
to-day by any unprejudiced reader of the evi- 
dence, though unfortunately the necessity in 
higher quarters of finding a scapegoat for the 
unfortunate blunders at ChanceUorsville long 
threw a whoUy undeserved reproach upon the 
Eleventh Corps, to which his forces belonged. 
As a matter of fact. General Schurz had dis- 
tinctly foreseen the danger of just such an 
attack as Jackson actually made, hatl reported 
the movements of hostile troops directly in har- 
mony with his forecast, and had protested again 
and again that the Eleventh Corps was in an 
absolutely fatal position if the apparently in- 



tended assault should come. But in spite of all 
this warning, the superior authority was capable 
of believing that Jackson's forces were in fuU 
retreat, and of leaving the array in a position 
which would have been justifiable only if that 
unwarranted theory had been a demonstrated 
fact ! The frank, dignified, and lucid presenta- 
tion of the whole case, with which the second 
volume of these reminiscences closes, leaves 
nothing to be desired, and is highly honorable 
to the mind and heart of the writer. 

It is a great misfortune that the story breaks 
off at so early a period in the author's career. 
We are not told, in these volumes, whether he 
left materials for its continuation through the 
remaining forty years of his active life, but it 
may easily be conceived that the present might 
not be the most auspicuous time for the publi- 
cation of such materials, at least so far as they 
concern the imperialistic movement of the past 
decade. 

Carl Schurz was emphatically an idealist, but 
never a mere doctrinaire. Holding unswervingly 
to the belief in personal and political liberty as 
the best means of social and political progress, he 
yet realized at a very early period in his career 
that liberty in itself is no cure-all for human 
troubles. It merely clears the way for possible 
improvement. 

" The newly arrived European democrat, having lived 
in a world of theories and imaginings without having had 
any practical experience of a democracy at work, behold- 
ing it for the first time, asks himself: ' Is this really a 
people living in freedom ? Is this the realization of my 
ideal?' He is puzzled and perplexed until it dawns 
upon him that in a condition of real freedom man mani- 
fests himself not as he ought to be b>it as he is, with all 
his bad as well as his good qualities, instincts and im- 
pulses; with all his attributes of strength as well as his 
weaknesses: that this, therefore, is not an ideal state, 
but simply a state in which the forces of good have a 
free field as against the forces of evil, and in which the 
victories of virtue, of enlightenment, and of progress 
are not achieved by some power or agency outside of the 
people, for their benefit, but by the people themselves." 

Few men of his time appreciated order and 
efficiency in government more highly than did 
Schurz, as is amply proved by his vigorous and 
long continued battle for order and efficiency in 
the Civil Service of the United States ; but he 
realized that even such desirable qualities as 
these come at too high a price when imposed 
from without, at the sacrifice of freedom. Even 
a slow and comparatively disorderly approach to 
better things, through the stony path of experi- 
ence, is better than the firm hand which reaches 
down from above and removes disorder and 
responsibility at the same time.

" What is sometimes called the Art of Self-go vermnent 
is not learned by masses of people theoretically, nor 
even bv the mere presentation of other people's eiperi- 
eaees by way of instructive example. Practice is the 
only really effective teacher. Other methods of instruc- 
tion will rather retard, if not altogether prevent, the 
development of the self-governing capacity, because 
they wtII serve to weaken the sense of responsibility and 
self-reliance. This is the reason why there is not an 
instance in history of a people having been successfully 
taught to govern themselves by a tutelary power acting 
upon the principle that its wards should not be given the 
power of self-government until they had shown them- 
selves fit for it." 

He was perfectly willing to admit that self- 
government does not reach the highest possi- 
bility in point of a wise and economical 
administration of public affairs. We can easily 
conceive of a wise, just, benevolent, and unselfish 
despot capable under any given circumstances 
of controlling affairs more advantageously than 
the people, through any possible machinery of 
self-government, could manage them for them- 
selves. But with all its shortcomings in the 
work of administration, self-government is im- 
measurably superior as an educator. 

" The foreign observer in America is at once struck 
by the fact that the average of intelligence, as that 
inteUigence manifests itself in the spirit of inquiry, in 
the interest taken in a g^reat variety of things, and in 
alertness of judgment, is much higher among the ma.'Bifa 
here than anywhere else. This is certainly not owing 
to any superiority in the public school system in this 
country — or, if such superiority exists, not to that 
alone — but rather to the fact that here the individual 
is constantly brought into interested contact with a 
greater variety of things, and is admitted to active par- 
ticipation in the exercise of functions which in other 
countries are left to the care of a superior authority." 

We would gladly take up various other phases 
of this commendable and interesting career, and 
illustrate them by ample quotation, did space 
permit. The constant evidence of the author's 
keen appreciation of the highest achievements 
in music, the drama, and other branches of 
artistic effort, cannot fail to give pleasure to 
every cultivated reader. When he wa.s in Berlin 
stealthily perfecting his plans for the rescue of 
Professor Kinkel. although in constant danger 
of detection and imprisonment, the fame of 
Kachel's acting drew him again and again into 
the theatre, and the overwhelming impression 
which the mysterious power of the Alsatian 
Jewess made upon him is described in para- 
graphs hardlv less artistic and effective in their 
own way and for their own purpose than was 
Rachel's acting in the field to which it belonged. 
Indeed, one of the notable things in the career 
of Carl Schurz was the ease with which he 
acquired a mastery of English surpassed by 



very few even of the native-bom Americans of 
his time. 

With the externals of this work one might 
easily pick a few quarrels. There should have 
been some guide to its contents, such as a brief 
analytical paragraph at the head of each chapter. 
Again, either the proof-reading has been lament- 
ably careless in a considerable number of 
instances, or else bad editorial judgment has 
religiously followed mere slips of the pen in the 
original manuscript. Carl Schurz himself was 
hardly likely to have had three ways of spelling 
the name of his friend Greneral Schimmelpf ennig, 
nor could he have forgotten that the running 
mate of General Scott in the Presidential cam- 
paign in progress when he first landed on 
American shores was named Graham, not 
Gorhatn. Still less could he have written of 
General " McDowell's sharp tongue, which ckme 
also mischief elsewhere." Time was when our 
leading publishers were a little more careful in 
such matters. All this, however, cannot seri- 
ously detract from the value of one of the really 
great biographical works of recent years, des- 
tined to an honored place on the shelf which 
already holds the life stories of Lowell, Tennyson, 
Andrew D. White, Conway, Stillman, and 
Leslie Stephen. w. jj. Johnson. 



A Tkamp Across Widest Africa.* 

Mr. A. Henry Savage Landor needs no in- 
troduction to readers of books of travel. His 
adventures and explorations in the highlands of 
Asia, in China, and in the coveted lands of the 
Near £ast, have made him one of the most no- 
table travellers of our day. "Across Widest 
Africa," his most recent book, recounts one of 
the most ambitious and most important journeys 
ever made in Africa. Starting from Djibuti in 
French Somaliland, on January 6, 1906, Mr. 
Landor travelled 8500 miles, for the most part 
alone except for one faithful Somali servant, and 
reached Cape Verde, the most westerly point of 
Africa, in one day less than a year. His route 
lay through regions but little travelled, and 
among curious savage tribes that have been but 
little studied. 

Unlike most African explorers, Mr. Landor 
disdained the usual appointments in his outfit. 
The elaborate traveller's apparel, with its pith 
helmet, its special headgear and footgear, and 
its means of protecting the body from the bum-

ing sun of the tropics, was discarded, and in its 
place was worn the customary London attire for 
a walk down Piccadilly — a blue serge suit and 
a straw hat ! Moreover, in this land of virulent 
malarial fever and pestilential diseases Mr. 
Landor carried only the simplest remedies, such 
as carbolic soap, castor oil, caustic, and iodine. 
And the greatest of these was castor oil ! — his 
panacea for aU aches and ills, from incipient fever 
to the restoration of a man who was struck by 
lightning. To this disregard of the ordinary pre- 
cautions against accidents, the author ascribes 
his continuous health during his arduous jour- 
ney. But an important factor doubtless was 
his faith in the value of sunshine; for, imlike 
many travellers in Africa, he seldom made night 
marches. But to whatever due, his splendid 
physical condition allowed him to use every 
moment of his time in energetic activity. 

Abyssinia and the Emperor Menelik form the 
subject of some very interesting chapters of the 
book. The Emperor is, according to the author, 
an admirable man. 

" He possesses an abnormal amount of sound sense. 
He is as just and fair to his coxmtry as is possible to an 
Emperor ; he is generous enough with what he possesses, 
and tries at all times to do what is right and proper. 
His simplicity and natural charm of manner are quite 
delightful." 

This charming Emperor certainly has a novel 
way of obtaining building material. 

" If he wishes to put up another building, in the 
Palace for instance, or a church somewhere, he rides 
out upon his mule and picks up a stone or a piece of 
wood, which he carries back upon his shoulders to the 
Palace, or to the spot where the erection is to be made. 
The thousands of soldiers who always follow him nmst 
imitate his example, so that by the evening plenty of 
building material is already at hand." 

Many curious customs of the Abyssinians are 
recounted, and although they are but semi- 
civilized — a state in which they are not long to 
be allowed to remain — they appeal to us for 
one marked trait revealed in the following 
comment : 

" There is one great thing in Abyssinia — goods 
travel in absolute safety, when not accompanied by a 
military escort. Caravans can travel from one end of 
the country to the other, provided the necessary passes 
are carried, without fear of being robbed." 

To the west of Abyssinia the author met sev- 
eral tribes with jjecidiarly long legs. These 
Shiluk, Denka, and Nuer people have such 
remarkably developed anatomical structures that 
the observer is led to believe that they have been 
especially built by Nature to live in marshy 
regions. 

" Often one sees them along the river banks or in 
their villages, standing for long periods of time upon one 



leg, not unlike flamingoes, the other foot resting upon 
the knee of the extended leg." 

Among the Djur tribe, the iron-working 
indvistry has reached a relatively high degree of 
development. Notwithstanding their rudiment- 
ary tools, they smelt iron-ore and work the 
extracted metal with considerable success. Still 
farther west the author saw a "hard-working 
factory of vermicelli." 

Of the much-disputed "sleeping sickness," a 
sort of death-in-life disease, Mr. Landor, as 
usual with him when discussing any controverted 
point, has a well-defined opinion. He believes 
that it is a disorder of the spinal vertebrae, 
" producing severe effects mainly upon the cere- 
bellum, and, owing to the exhausted condition 
of the patient's blood, causing the intense 
drowsiness and exhaustion from which the suf- 
ferers generally never wake up." The usually 
assigned cause of the disease, the tze-tze fly, is 
held innocent by our author. 

Very naturally, the explorer writes at some 
length on the conditions in the Congo Free State. 

" I think there could be no better proof that the 
natives are well treated by the Congo Free State than 
to see how neat and flourishing all the villages were, and 
how numerous was the population on the Belgian side 
in comparison with the other side, the French. K 
these people were so ill-treated as they are made out to 
be (only by people who have never been there), I do 
not believe for one moment that they would remain 
where they are. All they would have to do would be 
to cross the river and go over to the French side. . . . 
Nothing could be simpler. Far from it, the inclination 
is just the other way. The people from the French 
side go over to the Belgian side in far greater numbers 
than those of the Belgian to the French. They find 
they can do better business and live just as happy in the 
Congo Free State, where roads were constantly being 
cut by the Belgians, and the coimtry was fast being 
improved." 

In regard to the indictment against the Bel- 
gian Government concerning the mutilation of 
natives, our author dismisses the whole horrible 
business with the assertion that photographs of 
hundreds of mutilated individuals, mutilated by 
their own people, can be taken in any part of 
Africa. 

In the country aroimd Fort Archambault the 
custom of elongating the lips of the women, to 
enhance their beauty, was more pronounced than 
in any other part of Africa. 

" It was most ludicrous to hear these young ladies talk, 
especially when they had two plates, one in the upper 
and one in the lower lip, as these clapped like castanets, 
and the voice became nasal and unmusical. . . . The 
plates in the hps were occasionally removed, when the 
upper lip hung down so low in a loop as to reach lower 
than the chin, and left a repulsive aperture under the 
nose through which one could see the teeth."

From the r^on of the Ubanghi River the 
explorer journeyed to Lake Tchad, in order to 
study the mooted geographical problems about 
that lake ; thence he travelled in a wide semi- 
circle northward and eastward in Kanem, to 
visit some of the fanatical tribes on the border 
of the Borku and the Sinussi region, and to study 
the fanatical Musselman movement against the 
white people. This movement imdoubtedly orig- 
inated among the Marabu (priests). " These 
people," says Mr. Landor, "at best a most un- 
scrupidous lot, are blowing the fire with all their 
might, and the time will come when they will 
feel strong enough and will make a firm stand 
against Christianity." Superstition, which is 
rampant among the people, is carefully nursed 
by the priests. " The Sultan of Zinder himself 
tells a story, in all seriousness, of a ]^Iarabu 
being transformed into a lion under his own (the 
Sultan's) eyes. In order to be able to accom- 
plish a similar feat of transmigration, the Sultan 
had been smearing himself with powder for 
three consecutive months. ' 

In the Nigerian region was met one of the 
most interesting people described in the book. 
The Tuaregs. according to the author, are re- 
specters of women. Unlike those of other African 
tribes, the Tuareg women are quite free ; they 
go where they wish ; they take a leading part in 
the councils of the tribes ; they make war or 
peace between tribes, and often they are at the 
bottom of the raids upon passing caravans or 
upon weaker tribes. The men of the tribe fight 
their enemies in a manly way. They do not 
poison their spears or their arrows, and disdain 
to carry fire-arms, for with such modem imple- 
ments of warfare, say the Tuaregs, you can kill 
your enemy without being seen or running any 
danger to yourself. 

From Lake Tchad to Timbuctu, a distance 
of about 1500 miles, the country is inhabited 
by the Tuaregs, the Haussas, and the tribes of 
the Niger Valley. The author made a consid- 
erable visit at Timbuctu, and writes an inter- 
esting account of this town with the melodious 
name. Here, as elsewhere in Africa, Mr. Landor 
found much to commend in slavery — not as a 
theory, but as a condition beneficent to the slave. 
We can readily agree vs-ith our author, in view- 
ing the pictures presentetl in the book, that the 
varieties of head-dress worn in Timbuctu are 
most remarkable. 

Mr. Landor's opinion of Africa, at least that 
part of Africa through which he travelled, is 
indicated in the following passage. 

" People in Europe hare a most erroneous idea that 



all conntries in Africa must be highly picturesque ; but, 
indeed, there is no continent in the world where an3rthing 
is more difficult to find than is picturesqueness among 
the people, scenery, or buildings, in the zone of Africa 
I travelled. There is no attractive colour to speak of 
in the landscape, the light being too brilliantly diffused 
in the middle of the day, and the contrasts too hard and 
violent in the morning and evening. As for the people, 
they are ungraceful and ugly, and wrapped In clnmsy 
clothing, usually white or brown. . . . Central Africa 
has a depressing effect. One never sees or hears any- 
body enjoy life thoroughly. All moan, sulk, and look 
or feel nasty about everything." 

Mr. Landor's book has none of the usual 
characteristics which we associate with African 
travellers' tales. There are few exciting adven- 
tures with animals, and the most momentous 
accident which seems to have happened to the 
author was to cut his hand while opening a tin 
can. But Mr. Landor did not go to Africa to 
find adventures, and his trans-African journey 
was planned in such an unpretentious manner 
and carried out in such a thoroughgoing busi- 
ness-like way that we cannot hold him account- 
able for not realizing our youthful expectations 
of direful accidents by field and flood. He is 
far more concerned with the characteristic fea- 
tures of that countrj' than we have even inti- 
mated in this review. The rivers, mountains, 
elevations and deserts, the flora and fatma, the 
various complicated tribal divisions and names, 
the languages and customs of the tribes, and 
the host of details which of necessity must con- 
stitute the study of the observing traveller, are 
the objects which appeal to him. It should be 
added that the volumes are splendidly printed 
and handsomely and profusely illustrated.

Reading new books instead of old is not a thing 
that it is usually thought necessary to urge upon present- 
day readers; but Mr. Richard Whiteing, of " No. 5 John 
Street," has taken the trouble to advise this practice, 
forestalling objections by adding that " for every age the 
chief business is to reset the problems and principles 
of the past in terms of the present. You need never, 
therefore, fear you would miss anything of first im- 
portance." But how are we to know surely and at first 
hand what were the problems and principles of the past 
I without studying the records of that past ? A conspic- 
uous instance of what Mr. Whiteing regards as undue 
attention paid to antiquity he finds in the monumental 
Cambridge " Modern " History, which begins its multi- 
voluminous treatment of modem events with the year 
1492. " You may imagine at this rate," he says, " what 
chance Methuselah himself would have to catch up, say, 
with our first Reform Bill." All this would be more 
convincing if urged, not by a writer of modem books, 
but by one of the ancients, as by Plutarch, for example, 
or Plato, or Terence, or Tacitus. Cannot the Psychic 
Researchers obtain for us the views of these gentlemen 
on this interesting question?

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Nature's Various Ways.* 

There are so few stories among the new 
nature books that they may seem on the whole 
rather inferior in interest to those of other 
seasons. But in range of subject at least they 
are unusual, and among them are several books 
quite out of the ordinary. The eyes of nature- 
lovers will brighten at sight of the new volume 
by M. Maeterlinck, which he calls " The Intel- 
ligence of the Flowers," and intends in some 
sort as a complement to the essay on bees. The 
title suggests such endless adaptations of root, 
stem, and leaf, as well as blossom, that disap- 
pointment awaits the reader unless heed is given 
to the author's warning that he wishes " merely 
to recall a few facts known tfl every botanist," 
and has "no intention of reviewing all the 
proofs of intelligence which the plants give us." 
He confines himself almost entirely to the 
delicate arrangements for cross-fertilization, de- 
scribing them with as great scientific accuracy 
as if he were not a poet. But the charm of the 
book lies nevertheless in the fact that he is a 
poet. Life is to him a great inclusive mystery 
in which flowers have a share comparable to 
that of human beings. 

" It would really seem as though ideas came to the 
flowers in the same way as to us. The flowers grope 
in the same darkness, encounter the same obstacles, 
the same iU-will, in the same unknown. They have the 
same laws, the same disillusions, the same slow and 
difficult triumphs." 

The book-making is daintily done, though one 
longs for drawings of lilies and orchids in place 
of the photographs of conventional gardens. 

If flowers have intelligence, animals must 
have morals. At least the reader is tempted 
to make that logical connection between M. 
Maeterlinck's book and Mr. Thompson Seton's 
" Natural History of the Ten Commandments," 
which attempts to show that animal tribes have

flourished in proportion as they have approxi- 
mated obedience to the decalogue. " Years ago," 
says the author, " I set for my theory that : The 
Ten Commandments are not arbitrary laws 
given to man, but are fundamental laws of all 
highly developed animals.''^ The novelty of 
this theory makes the essay, which is little more 
than a pamphlet in bulk and binding, the most 
original writing of the group under discussion. 
Scoff as the reader may at the beginning, he is 
likely in the end to consider the idea a possible 
argument for moral evolution. Mr. Seton evi- 
dently believes in separating business and pleas- 
ure, for though he outlines a few stories to prove 
his points, he does not allow himself to elaborate 
them enough to interfere with the seriousness of 
his purpose. 

Mr. Long's new volume, " Whose Home is 
the Wilderness," on the contrary, is a story- 
book pui-e and simple. To our surprise, the 
author appears in its pages gun in hand. But 
he usually manages to turn his shooting into a 
joke, and to tell entertainingly how his interest in 
his intended victim overcame his desire for meat. 
The title of one chapter, " Wild Folk One by 
One," expresses the underlying idea of the 
stories, which is that each animal has its own 
individuality, and that this is much more marked 
among the wild than among the domesticated 
species. Two of the stories, '* A Sable Hero " 
and " Himself," will hold their own with the 
best Mr. Long has written. The first relates 
how a crow, bent on giving the alarm-call to a 
flock of birds, deliberately faces the gun which 
has just shot down his mate, and how the gunner 
feels " that a man must not shoot a bird like 
that "; the second is dedicated to the white- 
throated sparrow, and comes as near as one 
would think possible to putting into words the 
author's feeling for his kindred of the wild. 
That we need to reform some of our ideas is 
several times indicated — as in this instance : 

" To imderstand a wild goose two things are neces- 
sary, luck and a good disposition; luck to find him at 
home, and a disposition to lay aside your gun and your 
prejudices and to see with an open mind. If happily 
these two pleasant things have ever fallen to your lot, 
you no longer call a person a goose unless you mean to 
pay him a compliment and you no longer speak of a 
wild goose chase as a symbol of a useless and hopeless 
quest; for among all the birds there is none that so 
readily responds to your advances, and none that so 
abimdantly repays you for yoiu' time and trouble." 

In make-up the book corresponds to previous 
volumes from the same pen, except that the mar- 
ginal drawings are more varied. 

The two bird books of the present group 
are of very different chai-acter. Mr. Rich's 



1907.] 



THE DIAL

" Feathered Game of the Northeast " is a 
sportsman's book in the sense of giving elab- 
orate and accurate descriptions of game birds, 
and not in the sense of giving lengthy admoni- 
tions about shooting. Aside from an emphatic 
plea for obedience to game laws and moderation 
in killing, the author for the most part leaves 
methods to be inferred. His descriptions are 
so good that enjoyment of them need not be con- 
fined to sportsmen, while the numerous full-page 
drawings will help bird-lovers to identify closely 
related species of plover, duck, grouse, etc. 

To most readers Mr. Finleys hunting will 
seem even more satisfactory, for it was done 
only with the camera. The attractive title 
'' Americ^an Birds Photographed and Studied 
from Life "' gives only a slight idea of the 
attractiveness of the text. One is tempted to 
dare a superlative and call this.the most delight- 
ful bird book that has been written. It con- 
fessedly does not cover the entire field, but it 
has something new to say of the commonest 
birds, and many uiiimagined things about rarer 
species such as yellow-throats, weavers, warbling 
vireos, and eagles. The ingenuity which was 
required to place the camera for some of the 
pictures — that, for instance, of the eagle's nest 
one hundred and twenty feet from the ground — 
would give interest to the pictures even if they 
were not fascinating for their own sakes. An 
individual bird or family is studied in each case, 
and the author makes them so human that we 
half repent of spying upon their secrets. To 
us, the end justifies the means ; but we should 
like to know how the birds felt about it. In 
several instances even this is made known, as 
when Mr. Finley cut out the wood at the back 
of a chickadee's nest and took a snap-shot of 
the sitt'mg mother-bird who bravely kept her 
place. This is what happened next : 

" I knew she had done a heroic de«d. I sat down 
under the tree to watch. As soon as all was qoiet she 
shot from the door like a winged bullet and struck right 
on the limb beside her mate who had been dee-dee-ing 
to her all the rime. Of course, birds do not feel as we 
feel, but I don't believe a sweetheart ever met her lover 
returning from a field of battle with a greater show of 
joy. They simply threw themselves into each other's 
arms. It wasn't a silent meeting either; there were 
real cracks of kisses and twitters of praise. Chickadees 
are not human by any means, but had she not defended 
her home all alone against a giant ? " 

After alL the outdoor life is not entirely for 
the animals, and two good books on campLag 
remind us that man may share it if he will. The 
first is a reprint of articles by Mr. Burroughs 
which have appeared in the magazines, recount- 
ing his trip to the Yellowstone with President 



Roosevelt, and a visit to Sagamore Hill. The 
friendship between the two men is ideal, and ad- 
mirers of both will be glad to have these records 
of it in available shape. These ''prominent 
citizens " disport themselves on a vacation like 
boys on a holiday, and one would ask nothing 
better than to have seen them as they ran from 
camp coatless and hatless to see the mountain 
sheep descend a precipice, or raced each other 
down the hills on their skis. The book is plainly 
bound, but has some excellent photographs. 

Mr. White's "Camp and Trail" is not an 
account of journeys, but a book of directions for 
those who intend to go camping and tramping 
in the West. So far as one who has not had 
experience can judge, the advice about clothes, 
food, tents, cooking utensils, etc., is thoroughly 
sensible. Certainly with the drawings, and even 
the names of firms that furnish the desirable 
articles, the way of it all is as '* plain as plum 
porridge," so that the westward-faring man, 
though a tenderfoot, cannot err therein. 

A book about gardens does not necessarily 
belong with nature books, since a garden is the 
place where art and nature meet. But it is pleas- 
ant to find in the present collection as enjoyable 
a volume as Miss Kingsley's " Eversley Crardens 
and Others." To be sure, the volume is in one 
way an encourager of envy, for the reader can 
only hear about the garden and look at the pic- 
tures of it, while the writer not only has the 
garden but has had the joy of making it. But 
if the reader does not receive his share of the 
pleasure it is his own faidt. Even the long list 
of plant-names can be made as impressive as the 
Catalogue of the Ships if they are read in the 
right spirit. For practical purposes the book will 
have little value for Americans, since the English 
climate is so much kinder to roses and other 
things. But anyone who is enthusiastic about 
flowers will enjoy the combination of good sense 
and artistic feeling with which Miss Kingsley 
presents the whole process of gardening, from 
the dme when the soil is turned " moist and blue 
on one side where the spade presses, softly lilac 
and chocolate where it breaks and crumbles," to 
the time when the cut flowers stand in the vase — 
" which should always form a harmonious whole 
with them. ' 

"God's Calendar," by Mr. William Quayle, 
sums up in a general way much that has been 
said in detaU in the other volumes. Having read 
of the individual bird, beast, and blossom, we 
may read here of the individual month, and what 
it accomplishes in the world. " Twelve comings 
and goings of the moon, with a few days excess

thrown in for good measure, as is customary with 
God; and God's Calendar is an accomplished 
loveliness." Each month is celebrated some- 
what briefly, but with rather a sure sense of its 
peculiar quality, and the word-pictures are en- 
forced with delicate photogravures. 

" January is winter at noon. Weather cuts up now 
if at all. The sense of mastery, cold, cruel, relentless, 
is in winter's heart. . . . March is the feast of trumpets 
of the year. It is the wind month. Jehu's driving was 
a jog trot compared with the speed of the March winds. 
. . . June for the wild rose blooming ! June never 
wears at her throat other than a wild rose flower. Nor 
could a colorist like Titian conjure up a tint more 
enticing." 

But it is obviously unfair to quote disjointedly. 
The tone of the book is distinctly rapturous, but 
it will find many appreciators. One would sur- 
mise that it will be especially popular with the 
older generation of readers, who have not been 
sated with nature books, and who will like it for 
expressing feelings which they have never quite 
dared to voice for themselves.

A letter-writer who has kindled enthusiastic

Horace Walpole and Edward FitzGerald, can- 
not but be an object of interest to a wide circle 
of students and readers. Miss Janet Aldis's

readable, and altogether excellent account of 
Madame de Sevigne and her times. With an 
abundance of seventeenth-century memoirs at

her disposal, the author reproduces no little of 
" the charm of that wonderful century," as she 
calls it^ the charm of romance and color and 
joyous life. As Sainte-Beuve has said, the 
letters cover " twenty-seven years of the most 
delightful period of the most agreeable French 
society "; and of course these letters are the 
most valuable of all extant material to a biog- 
rapher of their writer. Yet they have not been 
drawn upon imduly in this work ; familiarity 
will never breed weariness of their piquant 
charms. Who does not enjoy having the page 
before him brightened up with a vivid touch 
like the following ? The mother is referring 
to a Provencal gentleman described by her 
daughter. " I have seen sleeves like those of 
your chevalier," she writes. " Ah ! what a 
charming picture they make, dancing in a plate 
of soup, or sweeping over a salad bowl! But 
though they draw everything with them, I ques- 
tion whether they would draw me ; in spite of 
my weakness for fashion, I have a great aversion 
to slovenliness.' Portraits in abundance, and 
views of three houses once lived in by Madame 
de Sevigne, adorn the volume ; but the personal 
attractiveness of the lively and witty Marquise, 
as delineated by the pens of her admirers, 
appears to have been less successfidly repro- 
duced by the artist's brush. Miss Aldis, quot- 
ing the malevolent Bussy de Rabutin, speaks of 
the pupils of her eyes as being of different 
colors — using the word "pupil" where she 
evidently means " iris." Her fidelity, in gen- 
eral, to her authorities deserves praise ; she does 
not, like some of her sex who have essayed 
biography, vaidt from the spring-board of her 
imagination high over the actual facts. 

It was but a short while ago that the name 
of the Empress Eugenie, who now seldom 
emerges from the retirement of her Hampshire 
home, came into some prominence by reason of 
her alleged promotion of the Hispano-English 
royal marriage, she being godmother of the bride 
and feeling a deep interest in both bride and 
groom. Thus the present life of her, entitled 
" The Last Empress of the French," by Mr. 
Philip W. Sergeant, comes not inopportunely 
from the press. Agreeably written, clearly 
printed, and handsomely illustrated, the book 
is worthy of its subject. It shows, too, care 
and painstaking research in its preparation ; but 
one might have expected that the restraint 
imposed upon the biogTapher by the Empress 
Eugenie's being still alive woidd have been off- 
set by the advantage of some little help from her 
in the clearing up of certain obscurities in her

evoitful history. No traces of such timely aid, 
however, are manifest ; and the curious world is 
still left in darkness concerning some of the 
more important details of her acquaintance and 
marriage with Napoleon III. Not even when 
and where she first met him are we yet to know. 
However, swallowing our disappointment as best 
we can, we turn the pages and hit upon many 
passages of a very real and human interest. 
The famous " Mondays " at the Tuileries, with 
charades or tableaux under the supervision of 
Merimee or Viollet-le-Duc, or with romping 
games that somewhat scandalized those of stiff 
and stately habit, are pleasantly noticed, with 
other incidents of court life. On the whole, one 
is left with the impression of a beautiful and 
lovable character, after following the fortunes 
of the polynomial Spanish grandee's charming 
daughter from her birth in the city of Granada 
to her widowed and childless retirement at 
Famborough Hill. Studying once more the 
enigmatic genius of her imperial spouse, one can 
well agree with ^Ir. Sergeant in his assertion 
that '• history's final verdict upon Napoleon HI. 
has yet to be heard." and that " perhaps no 
final and satisfactory verdict can ever be given." 
A late decision in the Evans will case may 
remind some newspaper readers of the famous 
and wealthy American dentist's part in effecting 
the Empress Eugenie's escape from Paris to 
England in the war-distracted summer of 1870. 
This rather exciting story, drawn chiefly from 
the Evans Memoirs, is again fully narrated. 
Other equally good things in the book must be 
left tmnoticed in so brief a review. 

Of a different character from the preceding, 
thou^ on the same general subject, is the 
" Court Life of the Second French Empire." 
detailing "its organization, chief personages, 
splendour, frivolity, and downfall." Thewriter's 
gathering together of a great amount of history 
and myth, gossip and scandal, joke and anec- 
dote, is a performance of which he is either so 
little proud, or from claiming the credit of which 
he so modestly shrinks, that the authorship is 
ascribed to " Le Petit Homme Rouge" — the 
Little Red Man who is supposed to have haunted 
the Palace of the Tuileries and other residences 
of the French court, and to have his qtiarters 
now, under a republican rule, in the Elysee 
Palace. Li the more abundant leisure enjoyed 
by this gossipy ghost in these less superstitious, 
less credulous times, he has taken to recording 
his memories of the past : and hence we are 
treated to the present good-sized volume of 
miscellanies — history, biography, and scandal- 



ography (for it unblushingly professes to give 
some of the worst court scandals current). We 
said '• imblushingly," and said so advisedly, 
because the Little Red Plan's complexion must 
make it impossible for him to blush ; he leaves 
that to his readers. Among the many items of 
innocent interest with which his pages are also 
sprinkled may be mentioned the account of the 
luxury indulged in by the imperial household, 
wlule the Empire, all unsuspected by the pam- 
pered inmates of the Tuileries, was tottering to 
its fall. His stable alone, with its three or four 
hundred horses and its scores of attendant 
menials, cost Napoleon HI. nearly two million 
francs a year. A matter of considerable imcer- 
tainty referred to in the foregoing paragraph is 
confidently cleared up by the Little Red Man, 
who asserts that the first time Eugenie de 
Montijo saw her future husband " was after the 
Strasburg aSsat in 1836, when, being in Paris, 
they [she and her mother] happened to call at 
the Prefecture of Police to see the Prefect's 
wife, Mme. Delessert, a Spaniard by birth and 
a family friend, on which occasion they saw the 
Prince passing in the custody of several police- 
men." The book furnishes entertainment and 
amusement, which is probably its prime purpose. 
A " Life of Louis XI." cannot but call 
instantly and pleasantiy to mind that "delicious 
summer morning, before the sun had assumed 
its scorching power, and while the dews yet 
cooled and perfumed the air," when a youth in 
short gray cloak and smart blue bonnet adorned 
with a single sprig of holly and an eagle's feather 
came walking with springing step from the 
north-east and made his way across a wide brot^ 
tributary to the Cher, toward the royal castie of 
Plessis-les-Tours. The kingly occupant of tihat 
castie turns out, upon historical inquiry, to be 
far different from the inhtmianly cold and calcu- 
lating and cruel villain of " Qnentin Durward." 
His latest biographer, Mr. Christopher Hare, 
appears to be the first to have nuide use of the 
nine large volumes of Louis's " lettres missives" 
and " pieces justificatives " which have just been 
published under the auspices of the Societe de 
THistoire de France. A remark of the Abbe 
Le Grand quoted by ^ir. Hare helps to explain 
why this able and in many respects estimable 
ruler has hitherto'been the victim of a " concert 
of maledictions." The Abbe sajrs : •' As it 
was needful for Louis XI., in order to establish 
law and order in the kingdom, to punish various 
great lords, even princes of the blood, such as 
the dukes of Alen^on and Bourbon — the King 
being also the persistent enemy of the great

House of Burgiuidy — and as all these lords and 
princes had chroniclers in their jjay, we cannot 
wonder that the King of France received from 
them the character of a sanguinary tyrant." 
The occasional scraps of fifteenth-century French 
that the author has interspersed give a quaintly 
realistic touch to his picture of feudal France. 
This " most difficult period of history " presents 
a network of tangled politics and a snarl of 
interminable feuds ; and the patience and skill 
with which Mr. Hare has threaded his way 
through it all deserves praise. Portraits, maps, 
chi'onological table, bibliography, and index are 
duly provided. 

The gossipy pen of the Comtesse de Boigne 
by no means ceased from its pleasant labors 
with the year 1814, which closed her first vol- 
ume of " Memoirs " as edited by M. Charles 
Nicoullaud and ah-eady reviewed in these pages. 
A second instalment covering the years 1815- 
1819 is now published, uniform with its prede- 
cessor and giving promise (though unexpressed) 
of more still to follow ; for the writing appears 
to have been done about the year 1835 — which, 
at the leisurely pace of the chapters already 
printed, would provide matter for three or four 
additional volumes. The four years now passed 
in review seem to have been spent by the writer 
with her parents, first at Turin, where her father 
was settled a short time as French Ambassador ; 
then in London, whither he was transferred in 
the same capacity ; and finally in Paris, which 
became his home once more upon his retirement 
from the diplomatic service. The unloved and 
imloving husband, M. de Boigne, is mentioned 
but three times in the whole volume. The 
Comtesse's experience of the life diplomatic 
moved her at its close to write : "I have seen 
the diplomatic career under the pleasantest con- 
ditions — when my father occupied an embassy 
of first importance, enjoyed the complete con- 
fidence of his own Government, and was in high 
favour with the London authorities — neverthe- 
less I emphatically repeat that it is one of the 
least agreeable that a man can pursue." Among 
the more important events touched upon by the 
writer are Napoleon's return from Elba, his 
defeat at Waterloo, and the restoration of 
Louis XVIII. She thinks that " possibly if he 
[Napoleon] had found among his former civil 
servants the same enthusiasm which inspired 
the military, he would have been better able to 
accomplish the gigantic task which lay before 
him ■'; but "his instinct for government imme- 
diately understood that these people represented 
public feeling much more than the soldiers." A 



significant footnote is a letter from Rainulphe 
d'Osmond, the Comtesse's brother, to his father, 
in which he narrates an occurrence that is also 
described in the page above ; and as the brother's 
letter is obviously the sister's source of informa- 
tion, a little comparison of the two accounts 
shows the readier that in this instance, and pre- 
sumably in others, the entertaining author is 
wont to clothe the baldness of fact in the 
embroidery of fancy. Much, therefore, that 
she records is to be taken with reservations. 

Mr. Francis Gribble's " George Sand and 
her Lovers " is written in a spirit of protest and 
revolt. To him English reserve in affairs of the 
heart and English intolerance of illicit love are 
nothing but ridiculous prudery — an exhibition 
of men and women " capable of better things 
grovelling at the feet of bourgeois conventions." 
This is perhaps an extreme representation of his 
attitude, and the quotation is wrested somewhat 
violently from its context ; but it is plain that 
his sympathies in the matter are on the further 
side of the Englisli Channel. Convinced that 
previous biogi-aphies of the gi-eat Frenchwoman 
have slighted an interesting side of her character, 
he attempts to make good their shortcomings — 
to fill out their reticences — by detailing, from 
a great mass of extant letters to and from George 
Sand, the particulars of her successive passions. 
Contrasting the examples of George Eliot and 
George Sand, very much (as he evidently thinks) 
to the latter's advantage, he declares that whereas 
in England romance is degraded to tlie level of 
intrigue — or so it seems to the French — in 
France the endeavor is to raise intrigue to the 
dignity of romance ; and the best instance of 
such laudable endeavor is furnished by the sub^ 
ject of his volume. " Living in an extravagant 
age," he says, " she gloried in her own contri- 
butions to its extravagance. She not only ' lived 
her own life ' but boldly asserted her right to do 
so. Her feeling apparently was that, when she 
loved, she was making history ; and she took 
pains that the future historian should not find 
the records incomplete. Not only did she most 
carefully preserve such records of her amours 
as her own and Alfred de Musset's letters, and 
leave directions that they should be published 
after her death : she also chronicled them from 
day to day — almost from hour to hour — in 
her letters to various friends." Mr. Gribble s 
previous achievement in " Madame de Stael and 
her Lovers' ought to have qualified him for a 
similar study of George Sand ; and those inter- 
ested in this branch of literature will probably 
not be disappointed in this volume.

The recent death of Augustas Saint-Gandens 
makes timely the sumptuous publication bearing his 
name and consisting of an appreciation of his woA 
by Mr. Royal Cortissoz, elegantly illustrated ua photo- 
gravure- Xo American reader can fail to be proud 
of the fact that we may claim Saint-Gaudens. 
St«Tenson's title •• the god-like sculptor " rings in 
one's ears as one looks at these inspiring figures 
mad beautiful bas-relief s. Mr. Cortissoz was fortunate 
in knowing the great artist personally, and some of 
his most delightful passages are tho^« that embody 
jntimat^' reminiscence. The bulk of the monograph. 
howevo', is criticism, needless to say of the most 
discriiniiiating kind. There are twenty-four Olns- 
tnUJons, and the book is bound with rare taste and 
originality. Altogether it most be ranked as the 
leading American art-book of the year. (Hooghton,

An elaborate and authoritative monograph, which 
will be appreciated by students of the Venetian 
school and especially by admirers of its fine flower, 
Carpaecio. b "The Life and Works of Vittore 
Carpaceio." translated from the German of Pompeo 
M«dnienti and the late Gustav Ludwig by Mr. Robert 
H. Holeirt Cust. The thick quarto volume is bound 
with taste and lavishly illustrated. There are several 
fine photogravure plates, two hundred and forty 
half-tones, and a number of illustrations in the text, 
so that pictorially as well as from the point of view 
of scholarship the work is exhaustive. (E. P. 
Dutton & Co.. Slo. net) 

" The Keramic Gallery " by M[r. WUliam Chaffers 
was first published in 1871, as a pictorial snppletnent 
to the same author's "Marks and Monograms on 
Pottery and Porcelain." The illustrations were 
prioted by the Woodbury photographic proeess, the 
best method then known for securing faithful copies 
of the original specimens. In the new edition, just 
isbaed, half-tone plates have been suljstituted, mak- 
ii^ equally good or better reproductions, without the 
necessity of pasting them on separate mounts, as had 
to be done with the Woodbury prints. By wav of 
further improvement one hundred illustrations of 
potterj' and porcelain have been added, including five 
colored plates. The text has been revised wherever 
lapse of time or subsequent information has occa- 
sioned inaccuracies, and an index, which was greatly 
needed in the first edition, has been added. For 
the benefit of those unfamiliar with the work, it 
should be explained that the text covers ancient 
pottery, majuhca. Continental fayence. Continental 
porcelain, and the pottery and porcelain of Great 
Britain and of the Orient, to the beginning of the 
nia^eenth century. It includes both historical and 
descriptive matter, and it is both exact and exhaus- 
tive. ( Charles Scribners Sons, $12.50 net) 

One of the most elaborate and interesting art books 
of the season is " A Gallery of Portraits " reproduced 



from the original etchings of M. Paal Helleu. The 
reproductions are facsimile in size — with the result 
that the hook, ia decidedly unwieldly — as well as 
in coloring and style of mounting. A brief but 
authoritative and deftly phrased introduction by 
Mr. Frederick Wedmore places the artist and char- 
acterizes his dry-point work, illustrating its theaea 
from the twenty-four specimens in the present ooDee- 
tion. •' The greater part of Helleu's work." writes 
Mr. Wedmore, "consists of his prompt record of 
women." It is entirely this type of his portraiture, — 
"young and gracious women, seen with eyes appre- 
ciative, and set down for us with fingers deft and 
busy and untired," — that is here reproduced.

Not Florence, but its buildings, — not all those 
montmiental churches and pala4'«w that are the de- 
light of visitors, bat twelve only, chosen for their 
combined historical imd architectural significance, — 
this, in brief, is Mr. J. Wood Brown's account of 
the subject-matter of his " Builders of Florence." 
The boildinga »re diwcwiwc d in historical instead of 
architectural seqoenee,' ao that the architectural stu- 
dent may, at first glance, consider that his side of 
the subject has received somewhat desultory treat- 
ment ; but further consideration will show him that 
certainly the treatment is not snperfieiaL The 
artistic feature of the bo(^ which is qoarto size, is 
the work of Mr. Herbert Railton. well known for 
his remarkable drawings in pen-and-ink and wash. 
Sevens-five plates, besides the small chapter head- 
ings, emhellirfi Mr. Brown's Floroitjne stodies, and 
make of the book an art treasure as wefl as a de- 
lightful account of some aepettt ci Florentine life 
and thought as expressed most ritally and most 
permanently in the city's bofldings. (£. P. Dnttoa 
& Co., S6. net ) 

^ If we care to look upon the France of the past 
century," writes Miss EUisabeth Luther Cary in her 
preface to " Honor^ Daumier." " with eyes that note 
not merely the surface view, but types, ehaiacter- 
istics, deep-seated principles, unconscious tendenoes, 
with a dear appreciation of their values and rela- 
tions, we cannot do better than torn page by page a 
collection of Daumier 's drawings, if by good fortune 
such may have fallen in our way." It is the privi- 
lege of looking over such a collection of Daumier's 
greatest social and political caricatures that Miss 
CaiT offers her readers. Some seventy-five of them 
are reproduced as full-page plates, titles and captions 
being translated into English. Miss Gary's intro- 
duction is critical and interpretative, and makes an 
excellent basis for a study of the g^reat cartoonist's 
work. (G. P. Putnam's Sons, S5. net) 

Mr. Charles H. CafBn is well known as one of 
our foremost critics of native art and his " Story of 
American Painting " will find many eager readers. 
The aim of the book is " to trace the growth of

Colonial times up to its abundant harvest" At first, 
individuals are prominent: later, schools, motives 
and methods, the influence of England, DOsseldorf,

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Munich, and Paris are discussed ; and individuals 
are introduced by way of illustration. That is to 
say, Mr. Caffin tries to lay down general principles 
for the appreciation of American art, as well as to 
acquaint his readers with the work of our chief 
painters. No such history could be really valuable 
without illustrations, and the publishers have pro- 
vided a very generous number, so that merely as a 
picture-book the volume would be both entertaining 
and instructive. Mr. Caffin's criticism, however, is 
not of the kind that is subordinate to its illustrations.

Biography and Reminiscences. 

" Shirley Brooks of Punch " is an alluring title, 
and Mr. G. S. Layard's memoir carries out its 
delightful suggestion to the fuU. There is very little 
available material for a study of the early life of 
the great " Punch " editor, but with the beginning 
of his literary career there is an abundance, and all 
of it has been freely put at Mr. Layard's disposal, 
both by the proprietors of " Punch " and by private 
persons. A special feature of interest is the initial 
letters. They originally decorated " Punch's Essence 
of Parliament," with which Shirley Brooks's name 
will be always identified. There are also several 
interesting illustrations. Shirley Brooks was a de- 
lightful letter-writer, a voluminous and entertaining 
diarist, and a brilliant talker. His life makes 
interesting reading. London of the sixties and 
early seventies and " Punch's " inner editorial circle, 
besides many more intimate matters, live again in 
its pages. (Henry Holt & Co., $3.50 net.) 

Admirers of Abraham Lincoln and lovers of fine 
editions will unite in praise of " Abraham Lincoln " 
by Messrs. Carl Schurz and Truman H. Bartlett. 
Bound in paper boards with the French medal to 
Lincoln inset on the front cover, illustrated entirely 
in photogravure, and printed, in an edition limited 
to a thousand copies, at the Riverside Press, this 
reprint of the Schurz monograph, which first ap- 
peared in 1891, and of Mr. Bartlett's recent study 
of " The Portraits of Lincoln," is one of the notable 
publications of a year marked by its wealth of good 
things. Mr. Richard Watson Gilder's sonnet "On 
the Life-mask of Abraham Lincoln " is printed op- 
posite one view of the mask, and Stedman's "The 
Hand of Lincoln " appears in connection with 
Leonard W. Volk's casts of Lincoln's hands. The 
index to illustrations contains full and interesting 
notes on nearly every plate. The portraits of Lin- 
coln, of which a long series is reproduced, make, 
particularly in connection with Mr. Bartlett's essay, 
a fascinating study. It is unnecessary to say any- 
thing at this late day of Mr. Schurz's sketch, save 
to declare that it is well worthy the honor that has 
been done it by the publication of this Edition de 
luax. (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., $10. net.) 

Last year M. Lenotre's "The Flight of Marie 
Antoinette" was translated for English readers, and 
the interest taken in it has encouraged the publishers 
to offer a fresh translation of another episode in the 



life of the unhappy Queen. M. Lenotre's " The 
Last Days of Marie Antoinette " describes in minute 
and authentic detail the life led by the captive Queen 
in Les Feuillants, the Temple, and the Conciergerie. 
Only the narratives of eye-witnesses have been in- 
cluded, — a gaoler's wife, a gendarme, a sweeper, 
an upholsterer, and two servants. Originally pub- 
lished as short pamphlets, these unadorned accounts 
have been smothered by the dramatic additions of 
historians striving after a rhetorical effect. M. 
Lenotre restores them to their clumsy, vivid bare- 
ness, and presents tliem side by side with the official 
records. The translation of Mrs. Rodolph Stawell 
is easy and spirited, and the narrative in her English 
redaction is more absorbing than most fiction. (J. B. 
Lippincott Co., $3.50 net.) 

In a significant introductory chapter to his " Seven 
Ages of Washington " Mr. Owen Wister explains 
how the veneration felt for the first President 
resulted in the congealing, so to speak, of his per- 
sonality into a frozen image rigid with virtue, — a 
being whom we must admire but cannot love. " The 
unfreezing of Washington," explains Mr. Wister, 
" was begun by Irving," but he " went at it gpingerly 
and with many inferential deprecations. His hand, 
however, first broke the ice, and today we can see 
the live and human Washington, full length." It 
is this " live and human " Washing^n that Mr. 
Wister writes about, and his portrait is thoroughly 
convincing. The " Seven Ages " begin with ances- 
try and end with immortality. The biography is 
bound in old-style paper boards with calf back. The 
Washington coat-of-arms is on the cover-lining, and 
there are several illustrations. (Macmillan Co.,

The recent biog^-aphy of " James Francis Edward, 
the Old Chevalier " by Mr. Martin Haile grew out 
of Mr. Haile's collection of material for the life of 
Queen Mary of Modena, James's mother. The 
purpose was strengthened by the discovery that no 
connected biography of the Prince had ever been 
published. The chief sources of material were the 
vast collection of Stuart MSS. at Windsor, to the 
unpublished portions of which Mr. Halle was given 
access. As a study of personality, of the Jacobite 
movement in England, and of the views of a Stuart 
restoration held by the gi-eat powers of Europe, Mr. 
Haile's work will be fomid both thorough and inter- 
esting. Eleven photogravures, most of them portraits, 
a handsome binding, and uncut sheets, gilt-topped, 
make the biography as elegant in appearance as it 
is authoritative in content. (E. P. Dutton & Co., 
$4. net.) 

In "The Ghosts of Piccadilly" Mr. George S. 
Street writes entertainingly of some of the interest- 
ing figures whose presence has enlivened the annals 
of that famous thoroughfare. " Old Q," he explains, is 
its presiding genius ; Georg^ana, Duchess of Devon- 
shire, its most gi-acious figure. Byron spent there 
the last of his bachelor days and the last of his life in 
England. Lord and Lady Palmerston belong to the 
chronicles of the street by virtue of their residence

at Cambridge House. Burlington House and its 
inmates supply romance set in squalid tragedy, and 
Ffinin^ Hamilton danced and sang through life at 
Nmnber 23. A score and more of otlier flitting 
figures add each his touch of passion, poetry, gaiety, 
or glory. A dozen portraits, including a phot<^raT- 
ure frontispiece of " Old Q." serve to illustrate these 
lively, gossipy chronicles of bygone days. (G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. $2. net. ) 

Two volumes of '• Little Journeys." " To the 
Homes of Eminent Orators " and •' To the Homes of 
Eminent Artists," respectively, are Mr. Elbert Hub- 
bard's new books this year. As usual, his sketches 
are biographical and interpretative rather than geo- 
grraphical and descriptive, and as usual his range of 
subject-matter is wide. Whistler jostles Raphael 
and Gainsborough in one volume: and the names 
of Pericles, Mark Antony, Ingersoll, Marat, and 
Henry Ward Beecher will suggest the dissimilarity 
of tj-pe among the orators. Each sketch is accom- 
panied by a beautiful photogravure portrait, most of 
them being reproduced from engravings. (G. P. 
Putnam's Sons, $2.50 each volume.) 

Swift, Pope, Johnson, Storne, Cowper, Carlyle, 
Poe, Shelley, and Keats are the subjects of Miss 
Myrtle Reed's lively accounts of the " Love Affairs 
of Litorary Men." There is a portrait of each of 
them, coupled with that of the woman that each 
loved — best, last, or longest. For unfortunately the 
clearest deduction suggested by Miss Reed's book 
is that literarj- men make ardent but fickle lovers, 
offering at best a tumultuous sort of happiness to 
their wives and sweethearts. (G. P. Putnam's StMis,

Travel akd DBSCRiPTiojf. 

'• Mexico of the Twentieth Century," an authori- 
tative and exhaustive account of present-day condi- 
tions in our neighbor republic is written in the hope 
of remedying popular ignorance and prejudice in 
regard to a country whose geography, social and 
economic conditions, and facilities of travel are as a 
sealed book to Europeans and even to other Amer- 
icans. Mr. Percy F. Martin, the author, is a Fellow 
of the Royal Geographical Society, and author of 
'' Through Five Republics of South America " and 
" Mexico's Treasure House ": so that he knows his 
subject thoroughly. He treats it in so many different 
aspects that the seeker after any conceivable piece 
of information will be likely to find just what he 
wants somewhere in these two volumes. The illos- 
trations. from photographs, are as varied in subject- 
matter as the text. In tasteful binding, and neatly 
boxed, this set will make an acceptable gift for some 
of the difficult persons to whom few current publi- 
cations appeal. (Dodd, Mead & Co., S8.50 net.) 

Mr. Thomas Okey. in his preface, gives a terse 
account of his part — the author's — in the making 
of "The Old Venetian Palaces and Old Venetian 
Folk." It grew, he writes, from a pilgrimage about 
Venetian streets and canals "for the purpose of 
identifying, and precisely indicating, the position " 
of the palaces referred to by Rnskin, Fergosson, 



Street, and other students of Venetian architectare. 
The chief examples are described in the order of 
their erection, and grouped as Byzantine, Gothic, or 
Renaissance. From the writings of the three great 
Venetian diarists has been drawn an accompanying 
picture of life in the palaces in the days of Venice's 
greatest glory. There are fifty beautiful illustrations 
in color, and others, possibly more valuable to the 
stadent, in black and white, by Mr. Trevor Haddon, 
besides several reproductions from Ruskin's stodies 
of Venetian architecture. An nnnsuaUy artistic 
binding gives a finishing touch of elegance to a 
book that will delight all lovers of Venice. (E. P.

Mr. J. G. Millais is a hunter of wide experience, 
but he declares that nowhere has he found game 
so abundant and guides so companionable as in 
^«ewfoandland. His book entitled ^Newfoundland 
and its Untrodden Ways " is primarily for hunters 
and naturalists, dealing with the fauna of the country 
and the chase of its wild beasts and birds. But 
Mr. Millais has also much to tell of the daily life 
of the islanders and the customs of the Micmae 
Indians, of whom he has made a special study. He 
assures as that the stories and conversations he relates 
are all genuine, and not mere padding. The illus- 
trations are of remarkable interest. There are a 
dozen beautiful photogra%nires and colored plates and 
nearly a hundred line drawings and half-tones, either 
by Mr. Millais or photographed. The book is a thick 
quarto. (Longmans, Green, & Co., $6. net) 

Miss Elise Whitlock Rose's '•Cathedrals and 
Cloisten of Midland France " is published in two 
handsomely bound volumes, lavishly illustrated from 
photographs by Miss Vida Hunt Francis. Together 
the volumes contain four photogravure and two hun- 
dred half-tone illustrations picturing the churches of 
Central France, whose architecture is differentiated 
from that to the north and south by the dominance 
of the Byzantine influence. Miss Rose has already 
written of the South of France cathedrals; and the 
new books are bound uniformly with the others, and 
follow a similar method. That is, architectural 
beauty, historical associations, and human interest 
are all considered, and accuracy rather than popu- 
larity is the author's aim. (G. P. Putnam's Sons, 
S5. net) 

Miss Katharine M. Abbott has already written of 
the " Old Paths and Legends " of the New England 
coast and her account of the '^ Old Paths and 
L^ends of the New England Border " will be wel- 
comed by many readers. There are numerous ex- 
cellent photographs of the old landmarks, most of 
them made especially for this book, which is prettily 
bound with an inset of the Wolcott Mansion at Liteh- 
field. Conn., as its cover decoration. The western 
border, it must be remembered, swept slowly through 
central and western Connecticut while the Deerfield 
valley and the Berkshire hill country are its most 
storied regions in Massachusetts. These are the 
three localities around which Miss Abbott's account 
centres. (G. P. Putnam's Sons, $3.50 net)

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



A fascinating subject, a writer (Mr. Clive 
Holland) who knows how to make the most of it, 
and an illustrator (Mr. Montague Smyth) whose 
work must surprise even the most blasi critic into 
reluctant admiration, — these are the elements that 
contribute to the charm of " Old and New Japan." 
The text covers in unusually competent fashion a 
wide variety of topics, from the legendary genesis of 
the nation, its art and its religion, to Japanese babies, 
gardens, greetings, and festivals " quaint, pathetic, 
and beautiful." The fifty colored plates are not 
mere perfunctory accessories to the text ; they evi- 
dently embody genuine impressions, and they are so 
artistically reproduced that merely as a picture-book 
of Japanese scenes in town and country the volume 
would be of imusual interest. (E. P. Button & Co., 
$5. net.) 

Mr. Walter Tyndale is a painter who has spent 
some years at work in the Nile valley and is inter- 
ested in both the mysterious beauty of the ancient 
monuments and in the picturesqueness of the Egypt- 
ian life of to-day. Cairo with its winding streets, 
beautiful mosques, and tempting bazaars, Thebes 
with its tombs and temples, and Karnak with its 
wonderful wall-inscriptions and reliefs, furnish most 
of the material for the sixty beautiful colored plates 
and the chapters of description and personal reminis- 
cence of travel in Egypt which make up his recently 
published volume '' Below the Cataracts." (J. B. 
Lippincott Co., $3.50 net. ) 

J. W. and A. M. Cruickshank, the authors of "The 
Umbrian Cities of Italy," have attempted to carry 
out, as far as possible, the ideas of Mr. Grant Allen, 
who planned the " Travel Lovers' Library " and con- 
tributed several volumes to it. They have therefore 
tried to notice, in the two small volumes devoted to 
their subject, only mattei"s of essential interest in 
art, architecture, or historical tradition, leaving de- 
tails of ti'avel and the cataloguing of sights and col- 
lections to the authorized guide-books. Assisi and 
Orvieto are treated in volume one, Perugia and a 
group of smaller towns in volume two. Abundant 
illustration in photogravure and half-tone, with gaily 
decorated binding, will commend this work to the 
attention of the purchaser seeking books whose 
holiday appearance is combined with substantial 
worth. (L. C. Page & Co., $3.) 

The raison d'etre of "Cathedral Cities of France," 
a large octavo volume attractive in print and bind- 
ing, lies in its sixty beautiful colored plates, the 
work of Mr. Herbert Marshall, showing French 
cathedrals or streets in cathedral cities. Hester 
Marshall furnishes the accompanying text, which is 
a rather perfunctory performance, suffering, by com- 
parison with other work of its kind, from a lack of 
spontaneity and originality. The author seems 
oppressed by the weight of her authorities ; constant 
quotation from them on all sorts of subjects, whether 
architecture, topography, history, or scenic beauty, 
becomes monotonous after a time, and the reader 
longs for an occasional opinion that is unsupported 
by expert testimony. However, the text is obviously 



intended only as a running commentary on the 
pictures, and criticism that views it in any other 
light is therefore not demanded. (Dodd, Mead & 
Co., $3.50 net.) 

In "Greece and the ^Egean Islands," Mr. 
Marden writes especially for the tourist, with the 
object of showing him "that it is as easy now to 
view and enjoy the visible remnants of the glory 
that was Greece as it is to view those of the grandeur 
that was Rome." Technicalities and Hellenisms have 
been avoided, Athens has been treated very briefly 
because so much has already been written about it ; 
while accounts of new excavations not adequately 
described elsewhere, of journeys to remote inland 
sites, and of cruises to some of the classic islands of 
the -35gean, will be of particular interest to both 
tourists and stay-at-home readers. The volume is 
fully illustrated with reproductions of photographs 
taken by the author, who has spent much time in 
the Grecian Archipelago. The cover is particularly 
attractive. (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., !:^3. net.) 

The writing and illustrating of a travel-book seems 
rather out of Mr. Walter Crane's field ; but " Indian 
Impressions," his account of a last winter's trip 
through India with his wife, makes a delightful 
addendum to the lately published " Reminiscences." 
And as for the illustrations, they are not of the con- 
ventional sort. There are, to be sure, a colored 
frontispiece and sixteen excellent page-plates which 
are not particularly characteristic ; but there are 
also a far larger number of small drawings inserted 
in the text, depicting, with delightful humor, inci- 
dents of the trip, types of Indian tourists, and 
oddities of native life. (Macmillan Co., $2.50.) 

" Turkey and the Turks," by Mr. W. S. Monroe, 
is confessedly the result of a brief sojourn in the 
Ottoman Empire. Mr. Monroe states in his preface 
that he has tried to give " a brief but unified picture, 
gained through study and travel, of the incoherent 
Ottoman Empire and its complex civilization. A 
Scotch philosopher has remarked that if one wishes 
to give a strong and emphatic description of a 
country he must not linger long enough to be 
annoyed with contradictions." The topics covered 
are most of them of the sort that appeal to popular 
interest, eight chapters out of twenty-one and practi- 
cally all the illustrations being devoted to the sights 
of Constantinople. The book is printed on tinted 
paper, and the cover-design is particulaily pleasing. 
(L. C. Page & Co., $3.) 

Mr. Francis Miltoun, whose latest work is entitled 
" Castles and Chateaux of Old Navarre and the 
Basque Provinces," is the author of several delight- 
ful travel-books, and this is not the first time that 
Blanche M-cManus has collaborated with him as 
illustrator. For the present volume she furnishes 
a colored frontispiece and a genei-ous allowance of 
wash-drawings. There are also maps and diagrams 
to assist travellers in planning new trips or recalling 
routes already familiar. The text combines descrip- 
tive and historical material with personal impres- 
sions. (L. C. Page & Co., $3.)

In "The Florence of Landor " Miss Lilian 
Whiting ha« already published her impressions of 
one Italian city. She therefore omits any extended 
reference to it from her new book of Italian remin- 
iscences, entitled *• Italy, the Magic Land." The 
volnme is illustrated with over thirty fine photo- 
graphs. The chapter-titles are: '"The Period of 
Modern Art in Rome," " Social Life in the Eternal 
City." " Day Dreams In Naples, Amalfi. and Capri," 
"A Page de Conti from Ischia," "Voices of St. 
Francis d'Assisi." "The Glory of a Venetian June,"

"Historic Churches of America," by Mrs. Nellie 
Umer WaUington. consists of brief but entertaining 
sketches of the founding of nearly seventy famous 
American houses of worship, together with some 
account of the notable events in their history. By 
way of illustration there are photographs of about 
half the churches described. A suggestive introduc- 
tion by Dr. Edward Everett Hale provides the reader 
with some general information about the trend of 
religions thought in America, thus giving him a 
background for the detailed pictures presented by 
Mrs. Wallington. (Duffield & Co., S2. net) 

In an introductory chapter to his "Bohemia in 
London," Mr. Arthur Ransome explains that he does 
not intend to write about the talk at the Savage Club, 
the Vagabond dinners, or any of the other "con- 
sciously unconventional things that like to consider 
themselves Bohemian." The real " Bohemia in 
London," he declares, is hard to localize; visitors 
will not find there, as they do in Paris, men waiting 
about the principal streets offering themselves as 
guides to the London " Quartier." As a result, very 
few people in London are Bohemians for the fun 
of the thing, and the Parisian "tinsel and sham" 
is happily absent from its unconventionalities. It 
is impossible, of course, to separate the present-day 
Bohemia from its glorious traditions, so Mr. Ransome 
includes some history in his account Mr. Fred 
Taylor's illustrations, in poster style and printed on 
brown sheets, are exactly in harmony with the note 
struck by the text. (Dodd, Mead & Co., $2. net) 

Travellers through rural New England are 
familiar with those sombre weather-stained farm- 
houses whose huge rambling construction is ac- 
counted for only by the fact that once, before rail- 
roads took the place of stage-coaches, they were 
taverns. It is of these quaint hostelries of Colonial 
New England that Miss Mary Caroline Crawford 
writes, under the title " Little Pilgrimages Among 
Old New England Inns." describing them and relat- 
ing their histories. Many pictures supplement her 
account and g^ve alluring glimpses of the quaint old 
houses, some few of which are still catering to the 
chance traveller's need, though the majority are 
nowadays only " landmarks." A few chapter head- 
ings will serve to g^ve an idea of Miss Crawford's 
material : " When the Inn was a Puritan Ordinary," 
"The Taverns that Entertained Washington," "The 



Wayside Inn," " Some Portsmouth Publicans and 
Their Famous Guests." and " Tavern Signs — and 
Wonders." (L. C. Page & Co., S2. ) 

In choosing her " Historic Landmarks of Amer- 
ica " Miss Singleton has tried to include those where 
historical association is combined with striking and 
beautiful scenery and those that represent all sections 
of the country — north, south, east, and west Forts 
predominate, since nearly every American town orig- 
inated in a stockade. The footprints of early settlers, 
explorers, Indian chiefs, and soldiers in our various 
wars, have been followed, so that not only cities but 
lakes, mountains, plains, and rivers are described. 
As usual in Miss Singleton's books, the text is by a 
large number of interesting writers. Miss Singleton 
herself conti-ibutes an account of Annapolis. There 
are manv excellent illustrations. (Dodd, Mead & 
Co., S1.60 net ) 

"Castles and Keeps of Scotland," so its author, 
Mr. Frank Roy Fraprie, tells us. is the outcome of 
three trips to Scotland, supplemented by study of the 
authoritative histories and architectural treatises. 
While it is in part a record of personal opinions 
and experiences, it is intended more distinctively as a 
companion and guide for traveL As the only popular 
hand-book on the subject it will be sure to find an 
eager welcome. Mr. Fraprie treats a very inclusive 
list of Scotch castles, but for the benefit of the hurried 
tourist he su^ests a few of those best worth seeing 
for beautiful situation, for historic interest, or ro- 
mantic association. There are many beautiful illus- 
trations from photographs ; and a unique covei^design 
and effective end-leaves add a distinctively holiday 
touch. (L. C. Page & Co., $3.) 

Holiday Edition's of Staxdakd Literature 

First published in 1861. Palgrave's "Golden 
Treasury of English Lyric Poetrj- " still remains, 
despite the lapse of years and the change of taste 
since mid-Victorian times, the standard Ij'ric an- 
thology. A beautiful new edition has recently been 
issued, handsomely bound and worthily illustrated 
in line and color bj' Mr. Robert Anning Bell. Mr. 
Bell is one of a very few illustrators who may be 
trusted to adorn great poetry instead of marring it 
The color in some of his " Golden Treasury " plates 
is a little crude, — a fact due no doubt to the limita- 
tions of mechanical reproduction. — but the designs 
are always interesting and suggestive. Mr. Edward 
Hutton introduces the edition with an interesting 
account of the making of the collection and of Alfred 
Tennyson's part in it ( E. P. Dutton & Co., S3, net ) 

No daintier reprints can be imagined than the 
Dent-Dutton " English Idylls " series, with their 
delicate bindings and delightful colored illustrations 
done by Mr. C. E. Brock. The new volume for 
this year is Jane Austen's " Pride and Prejudice," 
and it is, if possible, more thoroughly satisfying than 
any of its predecessors. Mr. Brock is at his best 
in every one of the twenty-four pictures, with their 
delicious combination of old-time quaintness and 
the humor that belongs to all times. No better g^

than this can be imagined for the lover of really

Sidney Lanier's " Hymns of the Marshes " ap- 
pears in a beautifully illustrated edition, embellished 
by photogravure reproductions of Mr. Henry Troth's 
photograplis. Mr. Troth's work with the camera is 
thoroughly artistic ; he has been wise in choosing 
lines that lend themselves to photographic illustration 
and skilful in finding the right material in nature 
for his pictures. The result is a rarely beautiful 
edition of a classic text. (Charles Scribner's Sons, 
$2. net.) 

A beautifully illuminated frontispiece, and title- 
pages for the whole book and for each of its four 
parts, together with a white cover, gold-lettered and 
inset with small pictures, also in the illuminated 
style, are the decorative features of a beautiful new 
edition '• Of the ImiUtion of Christ." (E. P. Button 
& Co., $2. net.) 

A third volume has been added to the " Williams 
Edition" of Bickens. Like the others of the series, 
this contains stories appropriate to Christmas time, 
— "The Holly Tree Inn " and "A Christmas Tree." 
Mr. George Alfred Williams, the illustrator, con- 
tributes, besides a preface, ten full-page drawings in 
black-and-white and color, and many smaller ones. 
Mr. Williams's work is good, if not great, and will 
appeal particularly to the younger generation of 
readers. (Baker & Taylor Co., $2.) 

Four volumes — Bickens's "Oliver Twist" and 
"A Tale of Two Cities," and Scott's " Kenilworth" 
and "Ivanhoe" — initiate "The Prairie Classics," 
which are intended eventually to include, in uniform 
handy-sized volumes, the complete works of a con- 
siderable number of the great English novelists. 
The plates are new, the type attractive, the paper thin 
and yet opaque, with gilt tops and uncut edges, and 
the binding plain cloth, gold-lettered. Mr. George 
Alfred Williams, who has defied the traditions of 
the great caricaturists in his illustrations for some 
of Bickens's stories, has made a colored frontispiece 
for each of the four volumes. (A. C. McClurg & 
Co., $1. each volume. ) 

A pretty edition of " Evangeline," called out, prob- 
ably, by the Longfellow centennial, is gaily bound, 
furnished with decorated end-leaves, and lavishly 
illustrated in line and color by Mr. Arthur Bixon. 
Besides the full-page plates there are numerous small 
pictures, many of them in color, inset in the text, so 
that every second or third page is graced with some 
sort of illustration. (E. P. Button & Co., $1.50.) 

To the Bent-Button Bickens, with illustrations in 
color and line by Mr. C. E. Brock, two titles have 
been added, — "The Battle of Life" and "The 
Haunted Man." The volumes are daintily bound, 
in uniformity with the rest of the series, and Mr. 
Brock's work is of its usual delightful quality. There 
is perhaps more humor in the black-and-white illus- 
trations, while the colored plates are of course more 
decorative. (E. P. Button & Co., $1. each volume.) 

A new edition of Macaulay's " Lays of Ancient 
Rome," with an unusually attractive binding and 



many colored illustrations, large and small, by Mr. 
Paul Hardy, will appeal especially to younger read- 
ers. The volume is of handy size and prettily 
bound. (E. P. Button & Co., $1.) 

Illustbated B6oks of Fiction. 

Among the most inviting of the season's novels in 
holiday guise must be ranked Mr. F. Hopkinson 
Smith's " The Romance of an Old-Fashioned 
Gentleman." It is delightfully illustrated in color 
by Mr. A. I. Keller, one of his prettiest plates being 
used as a cover inset. The story is full of romance. 
There is the Old-Fashioned Gentleman's own, and 
there is also tlie one for which he acts as a sort of 
fairy godfather. The Old-Fashioned Gentleman is 
an artist, and the atmosphere of the story is that of 
Bohemian studios and art-schools in New York and 
Paris, which Mr. Smith always reproduces so con- 
vincingly. (Charles Scribner's Sons, $1.50.) 

One of Mrs. Beland's " Old Chester Tales," — an 
" odd one," so to speak, that has not been pub- 
lislied before in covers, — has been made the basis 
of a very dainty gift-book. There are illustrations 
by Alice Barber Stephens, floral-page borders, and a 
cream-colored cover ornamented with tall pink holly- 
hocks. The title of the book is " An Encore." 
(Harper & Brothers, $1.50.) 

" The Spinners' Book of Fiction " contains short 
stories by sixteen California writers, with illustra- 
tions and decollations by seven California artists. 
The binding of heavy buckram is unique, and the 
whole make-up of the volume is in the Elder Com- 
pany's best style. Gertrude Atherton, Mary Hallock 
Foote. Jack London, Mary Austin, Miriam Michel- 
son, Frank Norris, and Henry Milner Rideout are 
among the literary contributors. The book takes its 
name from the fact that the Spinners' Club of San 
Francisco got the material together, with the object 
of increasing their fund for the assistance of needy 
writers, artists, and musicians. (Paul Elder & Co., 
$2. net.) 

" Sport Royal," which is Anthony Hope's effective 
inversion of royal sport, as it is supposed to be 
enjoyed by certain Continental princes and their 
courts, is a dashing novelette, fuU of strange adven- 
ture, love, and intrigue. The hero and raconteur is 
a reckless young Englishman of the type that " The 
Prisoner of Zenda" immortalized. He fights duels 
without knowing why or against whom he is draw- 
ing pistol, breakfasts with cliarming princesses that 
he has never seen before, — all with equal non- 
chalance and zest for the game. Becorations by 
Mr. WiU Jenkins, colored illustrations by Mr. Simon 
Warner, and a royal purple cover with gold lettering, 
are in character with the contents. (Harper & 
Brothers, $1.50.) 

There were six Agathas, and the puzzle was to 
pick out "The Real Agatha," who was an heiress,

Huntington !Mason is the author of "The Real 
Agatha." (A. C. McQurg & Co.. SI. net.) 

The idition de luxe of Mr. Hitchens's master- 
piece, " The Garden of Allah," is illustrated from 
photographs picturing the desert and its people, 
artisticallv reproduced in sepia. No photographs 
could catch the poetic beautv. — the magic loveli- 
ness and the awful loneliness of endless wastes, — 
that gives " The Garden of Allah " its atmosphere 
and its distinction ; but these, which are by Hflene 
Philippe, at least do not jar, and the comparison 
between reality and the novelist's impressionistic 
descriptions is interesting. The text is printed on 
tinted paper, and the book is handsomely boand. 
(Fre<lerick A. Stokes Co., $2.50 net. ) 

Some years ago Mr. George W. Cable's " The 
Grandissimes " was published in a sumptuous qnarto 
volume embellished by Mr. Albert Herter's draw- 
ings. Now a new edition is issued, cheaper and of 
smaller size. But Mr. Herter's drawings are again 
beautifully reproduced in photogravure, and the 
book is handsomely boimd, uniformly with the 
edition of " Creole Days " published last year. 
(Charles Scribner's Sons! $2.50.) 

" Helen's Babies." in a smart new edition with 
pictures by Messrs. B. Cary Kilvert and C. V. 
Dwiggins, comes as a climax to the triumphal prog- 
ress of the book through nine English and two 
Scotch editions and translation into several Euro- 
pean languages. Older readers remember the first 
"Helen's Babies," in its light-blue paper covers, 
now sadly dog's-eared and faded. But paper-bound 
novels are now quite a thing of the past, and the old 
charm of them hardly survives comparison with the 
elegance of to-day's holiday editions. So, after the 
first difficult moment of readjustment, it is a pleas- 
ure to welcome this old friend in a new dress, and 
to read once more in the " Author's Edition " the 
merry record of Uncle Harry's persecution at the 
hands of the irrepressible Budge and Toddie. 
(Moffat Yard & Co., $1.50.) 

A pretty story full of the deeper meaning of the 
Christmas season is Mr. Robert E. Knowles's •' The 
Dawn at Shanty Bay." Its scenes are laid in a 
Scotch settlement in western New York. The hero 
is a crusty Scotchman. He inherits his creed and 
his theory of life from his Covenanter father, who 
"got till his rest wi'out hardly hearin' tell o' 
Christmas, or ony o' thae new-fangled schemes for 
worshippin' Almichty God." But before the end of 
the storj- Ronald Robertson changed his mind about 
Christmas and several other things. The novelette 
is prettily gotten up. with sjTubolic designs in color 
in the margins, illustrative chapter-headings, and a 
colored frontispiece. (F. H. Revell Co., $1. net) 

In 1901 a story entitled "Mother" appeared 
anonymously in a volume of short stories by various 
aathOTs, called "A House Party." Now, dightly 



remodelled and signed by Mr. Owen Wister, it is 
' published separately in the prettiest possible of 
bindings, with illustrations and decorations by Mr. 
.John Rae. Love and speculation in copper stocks 
are the themes of the novelette, which Mr. Wister 
i blithely dedicates " To my favorite broker, with the 
earnest assurance that Mr. Beverly is not meant for 
him." (Dodd, Mead & Co., $1,25.) 

" The Little City of Hope " is a Christmas book 
by Mr. F. Marion Crawford. Its covers are gay 
with scarlet berries, holly and mistletoe wreathe 
the margins, and there are pretty pictures by Mr. 
W. Benda. The story is about an unsuccessful and 
discouraged inventor and his little son who had no 
Merry Christmas to look forward to. So they set 
to work to build a " Little City of Hope," and they 
bnilded better than they knew, as the end of the 
, story shows. Pessimists ought to read it and 
I optimists will enjoy it (Macmillan Co., $1.25.) 

IxEXPEXsrvE Gift-Books. 
With two volumes, containing respectively 

: Stevenson's "The Sea Fogs" and Mr. W. H. 
Rhodes's " The Case of Snmmerfield," Messrs. Paul 
EUder & Co. begin a series of reprints to be known 
as •• Western Classics." The idea of the publishers 
is to offer literature that belongs characteristically 
to the Pacific slope, in dainty and artistic volumes. 

j The books are printed from special type on hand- 
made paper and bound in paper boards of various 
shades, with vellum backs, gold-lettered. 'Eaueh. has 
a photogravure frontispiece. It should perhaps be 

' explained that " The Case of Summerfield " is a 
fantastic story which attracted much attention when, 
in 1871, it appeared anonymously in a San Francisco 
newspaper. It is the one remarkable literary 
achievement of its author. (Paul Elder & Co.,

No other of the countless " miniature " series has 

' quite the distinction of the ''' Thumbnail " classics 
with their embossed leather covers, each especially 
designed to fit its contents, by Mrs. Blanche 
McManus Mansfield. The new volumes are 
Stevenson's " Travels with a Donkey," Longfellow's 

' " Tales of a Wayside Inn." and Dickens's ** The 
Seven Poor Travellers" and "The Holly Tree." 
(Century Co.. $1. net each volume.) 

Mr. Wallace Rice, compiler of the " Franklin

twenty characteristic incidents. ( A. C. McClurg &

" Cheek-Mated ; or The Tale of a Check-book, by

pleasant habit of annotating his checks, so that it is 
possible to make out their story without reading 
much between the lines. The tale has its ups and 
downs, but Mr. Snowdon declares cheerfully on the 
back cover of his check-book, " I consider that the

Mr. Herford's satires are so clever that even their 
victims must enjoy them. His new book holds up to 
ridicule a popular school of black-and-white artists 
whose beautiful girls possess so wonderful a family re- 
semblance that the men, who also belong to a strongly 
marked type, find it difficult to distinguish between 
them. The title of the book is "The Astonishing 
Tale of a Pen-and-ink Puppet, or the Genteel Art 
of Illustrating." As usual with Mr. Herford, text 
and illustrations are equally amusing. (Charles

"Betel Nuts," "rhymed in English" by Mr.

collection of Hindustan proverbs. They are so called 
because they color the native idiom even as the betel

the breath and reddens the lips of the folk of the 
bazaars." The proverbs have been cleverly rendered 
into English vei-se and attractively printed in sepia

decorations, and a colored frontispiece designed by 
Mr. WiU Jenkins. The binding and red silk end- 
papers are in keeping. ( Paul Elder & Co., 75 cts. net. ) 



On the title-page of " The Maxims of Methuselah "

" freely rendered into the idiom of the hour," and 
the illustrations are also thoroughly u|>to-<late, while 
the colored page-decorations add the needed sug- 
gestion of antiquity. A new nonsense-book by the 
author of " Are You a Bromide ? " will be sure to 
find a ready welcome. Mr. Louis D. Fancher is 
responsible for the artistic features. (Frederick

Mr. Newton Newkirk, author of " The Stork

there are many humorous illustrations by Mr.

In "Abelard and Heloise : The Love Letters," 
Miss Ella C. Bennett offers a gi-acef ul and interest-

her redaction ends at the pomt where sentiment was 
replaced by theological and religious discussion. A 
frontispiece in photogi'avure and a simple but 
appropriate binding, together with special type and 
paper, give distinction to the edition, which is a 
limited one. (Paul Polder & Co., 81.50 net.)

MiSCEXLAXTEOUS HOLIDAT BoOKS. 

Taking advantage of the recent interest in the 
subject awakened by the revolt of the French gov- 
ernment from Papal authority, Mr. Douglas Sladen 
writes about the sights of the Vatican Palace which 
are not generally accessible to the public and of the 
routine of life, official and personal, that centres in 
those hidden portions of the palace. Those to whom 
his title, •• The Secrets of the Vatican," suggests 
scandal will be disappointed. The history of the 
Vatican, its gradual construction and decoration, its 
libraries, private chapels, and Borgia apartments on 
the one hand, and on the other the elaborate 
machinery of the Vatican hierarchy, — the cere- 
monies that accompany the death and election of a 
Pope and the creation of a cardinal, the duties of the 
Papal Secretary of State and of the Cardinal 
Nephew, the simple every-day life of the Pope, the 
Papal andiences. the functions of the Papal Court 
and the Sacred Congregations, — these are the topics 
of which Mr. Sladen writes. An elaborate index 
renders the contents easily available, and numerous 
page-plates, including a plan of the Palace, add 
materially to the book's interest and value. (J. B. 
Lippincott Co.. So. net) 

In compiling •• The Story of the White House " 
Miss Esther Singleton has consulted histories, 
memoirs, travels, biographies, diaries, letters, official 
documents, and newspapers. She has confined her- 
self strictly to the social life of the Presidents and 
their families, avoiding any reference to the political 
turmoils of which the Executive mansion has often 
been the centre. Even then, in spite of the fact 
that the history extends to two stout volumes, it has 
been necessary to select from an enormous mass of 
material : and wherever there were alternatives Miss 
Singleton explains that she has chosen " the lighttr 
and more picturesque points of view." She devotes 
a chapter to each administration, and extra ones to 
the building, re-building, and remodelling of the 
mansion. The illustrations show the White House 
at different dates, some of its furnishings, and many 
of its occupants. (McClure Co- $5. net. ) 

As an essayist, as •* A Wanderer in Holland "

Town," comprising, besides poetry, many bits of 
delightful prose, have marked a new era in the 
much-abused art of compilation ; and " The Gentlest 
Art," his new anthology- of letters •* by Entertaining 
Hands," is of the same charming tv-pe. The letters 
are arranged in nineteen groujw, of which •• Children 
and Grandfathers." •• First Person Singular," 
" Friendship and More " must serve as examples. 
Altogether this is one of the " chosen few " among

Undoubtedly the favorite among Dr. Henry van

Other Wise Man." It has been published in many 
inexpensive forms, and now it appears in a sumptu-

pieee, and page-borders. Design and coloring are 
both beautiful, and those who like the story will 
want to ftossess it in this sumptuous form. (Harper

" The Value of Sincerity and Character " is- the 
rather clumsy caption under which Mary M. 
Barrows issues an exceedingly well edited book of 
extracts, all bearing upon that theme. Thomas 
Wentworth Higginson has written a {feasant intro- 
ductory essay on tlie same subject and the pub- 
lishers have provided a dainty white and gold cover 
and elaborate marginal deeorations. The extracts 
Taiy in length from a line to half a page, and have 
been culled with much discriminatku from a wide 
range of pro«e and po^c litoatnre. (H. M.

are rubricated headinga and a colored fronti8{nece

faculty that her other books have exhibited for doing 
a conyentional thing in an unusual way. (Paul

It is hard to daasify Dr. Henry van Dyke's 
"The Music-Lover." Narrative, sketch, appreciar 
tion. character-study, — it is at once all and none of 
them. In this brief note it must suffice to say that 
Dr. van Dyke describes the emotions of the true lover 
of music as he sits in his chosen place and hears a 
great orchestra render a great symphony. Generous 
margins appropriately deeorated in coW, and a col- 
ored frontispiece by Sigismond de Ivanowski, whose 
work has lately attracted 'much attention, are the de- 
corative featorea. (Moffat Yard & Co« $1. net) 

Two gift-bo(^ gotten up on a novel plan are 
■• The Parables," edited by Dr. Lyman Abbott and

has done editorial service. The books reproduce in 
strictiy Biblical phrasing the New Testament para- 
bles and the Old Testament story of David, respec- 
tively. They are in decorative bindings, and have 
marginal borders and illustrations. The aim has 
been to secure a reading for a great man's bi<^raphy, 
and for a body of Christian philosophy, that shall in 
each case add vividness to old issues by putting them 
on the same footing as contemporary literature, and 
thus bringing them into relation with everyday life.

A curious little document, which the publishers 
assure us is of undoubted authenticity, is issued 
under the inviting title " The First Nantucket Tea 
Party." It is a letter written in 1745 by Ruth 
Starbuck Wentworth to her mother. Besides relat- 
ing the amusing story of the first tearbrewing that 
ever took place on Nantucket, it traces the romance 
of Ruth Wentworth and Captain Morris, which 
began and ended while the letter was being written 
in those delightful daily portions that our grand- 
mothers used to indite as painstakingly as they did 
their other daUy stints. The letter is charming, and 
the setting it has been given, . with illustrations, 
decorations, and illuminations by Mr. Walter Tittle, 
makes it one of the most elaborate and artistic gift-

" The Land of Make-Believe," — the title is taken 
from that of the first poem, — is a collection of

like them even better, for they represent, perhaps 
unconsciously, the man's retrospect of the boy's 
hopes and joys and quaint fancies, often tinged with 
a I'etrospective pathos that did not belong in the 
boy's idea. Christmas wreaths and candles bedeck 
the cover, and there are illustrations by various 
artists. (Harper & Brothers, $1.40 net.) 

Dr. James M. Ludlow made a daring attempt 
when he wrote " Jesse ben David : a Shepherd of 
Bethlehem," and it is therefore the more to his credit 
that he certainly succeeds in convincing and inter- 
esting his readers. The book has been decorated in 
color and illustrated in a quaint style suggesting 
wood-cut prints, which harmonizes perfectly with the 
spirit of the text. This relates the story of the 
birth of Christ, as eye-witnesses, — shepherds, seers, 
soldiers, Jews, and Romans, — saw it, and talked 
about it. The English is modern but dignified and 
adequate, and the incidents, worked out in the vivid 
form of fiction, gain a fresh interest. (Fleming H. 
Revell Co., $1. net.) 



Notes. 



" Tlie Science of Ethics," perhaps the ablest of Leslie 
Stephen's books, is published in a secoud edition by the 
Messrs. Putnam. 

" A Text-Book in Physics for Secondary Schools," by 
Professor William N. Mumper, is published by the 
American Book Co. 



Baedeker's " Paris and Environs " has reached the 
sixteenth revised edition (in English), and is now pub- 
lished, with its many maps and plans, by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" Heine's Book of Songs " has found still another 
tiunslator in the person of Mr. John Todhuuter, who.se 
version is now published by Mr. Henry Frowde at the 
Oxford Clarendon Press. 

Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. publish a second edition, 
thoroughly revised, of the translation of " Villani's 
Chronicle " made some years ago by Miss Rose E. Selfe, 
and edited by the Rev. P. H. Wicksteed. 

Lamb's " Tales from Sliakespeare," edited by Canon 
Ainger, and Sheridan's " Plays " (the two famous ones), 
edited by Dr. W. D. Howe, are new volumes of the 
" Pocket Classics " published by the Messrs. MacmUlan. 

Professor J. B. Bury's "A Student's History of 
Greece " is an Americanized edition of an authoritative 
work, edited for the uses of our schools and colleges 
by Professor Everett Kimball, and pubUshed by the 
Macmillan Co. 

" Hymns That Every Child Should Know " is an 
anthology whose character is sufficiently indicated by the 
title. It has been compiled by Miss Dolores Bacon, 
and is published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
The music of the hymns accompanies the text. 

A volume of miscellaneous papers by the late Mary 
Putnam Jacobi has been brought together from various 
magazine sources and pubUshed by the Messrs. Putnam 
under the title of " Stories and Sketches." There are 
eight papers altogether, the greater number of them 
being in the form of fiction. 

A translation of Sig. d'Annunzio's "La Figlia di 
Jorio " is published in handsome style by Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. Miss Charlotte Porter contributes an 
introduction, and has also taken part in the work of 
translation, having been assisted by Sig. Pietro Isola 
and Miss Alice Henry. The work is illustrated. 

Two volumes of " The Shakespeare Library," under 
the general editorship of Professor Gollancz, are now 
published by Messrs. Duffield & Co. They give us, 
respectively. Lodge's "Rosalynde," edited by Mr. W. W. 
Grey, and Greene's " Pandosto," edited by Mr. P. G. 
Thomas. They make very pretty books, and are sup- 
plied with the needful critical apparatus. 

" Poems with Power to Strengthen the Soul " is an 
anthology compiled by Mr. James Mudge, and pub- 
lished by Messrs. Eaton & Mains. Its contents are, as 
the title indicates, of a distinctly ethical or religious 
character, and they are classified under suitable head- 
ings. Singularly, the book has no index of authors, 
although titles and first lines are duly indexed. 

That accomplished Latinist, Professor Frank Frost 
Abbott, has prepared " A Short History of Rome " for 
use as a school and college text-book. It is a book dis- 
tinguished by great lucidity of statement and a sense of 
proportional values. The many illustrations are judi- 
ciously chosen. Tlie period is from Romulus to 
Charlemagne. A pamphlet hand-book for teachers 
accompanies the work, and both are published by Messrs. 
Scott, Foresman & Co. 

German texts recently published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. include Grillparzer's " Die Ahnfrau," edited 
by Messrs. F. W J. Heuser and G. H. Danton; Keller's 
" Das Falmlein der Lieben Aufrechten," edited by 
Messrs. W. G. Howard and A. M. Sturtevant; and 
Hoffmann's " Meister Martin der Kiifner mid Seine

Gesellen," edited bv Professor Robert H. Fife, Jr. The 
Cbaries E. Merrill Co. send us in their series of " German 
Texts " an edition of Lessing's " Minna Ton Bamhelm," 
edited by Professor Philip L. Allen. 

Programme music is so large a feature of modem 
concerts that music-lovers are more than ever in need 
of guides to the ideas and intentions of the composers. 
An admirable guide of this sort is provided by Mr. 
Lawrence Gilman's "Stories of Symphonic Music," 
published by the Messrs. Harper. It gives just the 
sort of matter that should be (but frequently is not) 
printed with the programme. The selection of works 
described is catholic, ranging from Beethoven sym- 
phonies to such idtra-modem works as the tone-pictures 
of Strauss, Glazounoff, and Debussy. The comment is 
of a highly intelligent character, providing real inform- 
ation and avoiding the meaningless rhapsodizing into 
which writers upon music are tempted to fall.

A New Book by EDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS 

THE USE OF THE MARGIN 

[ In the Art of Life Series.] 

All of the author's charm as a public speaker is here trans- 
ferred to the prmted page. His theme is the problem of 
utilizmg the time one h^ to spend as one pleases for the aim 
of attauiiug the h^hest culture of mind and spirit. How to 
work and how to play; how to read and how to study; liow to 
avoid intellectual dissipation, and how to apply the open secrets 
of great achievement evidenced in conspicuous lives, are among 
the many phases of the problem which the author discusses 
earnestly yet with a light touch, and not without humor. 

Tliousauds of his admirers have been eager for just such a 
concrete and practical presentation of one aspect of Mr. 
Griggs's philosophy of life, and a popularity, even wider than 
that accorded his previous books, is anticipated for this Uttle 
Tolume. ^^ ^11 Bookstores, 50 cents net.
