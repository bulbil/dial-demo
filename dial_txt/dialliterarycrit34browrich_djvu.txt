ican book ? has long since lost whatever point 
it had, for wherever the English language is 
read at all, the American contribution to Eng- 
lish literature receives its full meed of attention 
and appreciation. The foreigner's estimate of 
the comparative standing of our writers is 
sometimes a little puzzling, and his praise is 
not always discriminating according to our own 
standards. Bat we no longer have cause to 
complain of his neglect, and it has now become 



our concern, not so much to attract his atten- 
tion to cor literature, as to turn that attention 
in the right direction. To the British or other 
foreigner looking for guidance in this matter of 
appreciation we should like to recommend a 
reading of the symposium, " The Most Amer- 
ican Books " which was published not long ago 
in our valued contemporary, " The Outlook." 
What is an American book ? was the question 
set to be answered by a number of thoughtful 
students of our literature, and the opinions 
given prove extremely interesting, both intrin- 
sically and because of their essential agree- 
ment. 

The question raised, it will be noticed, is not 
of the best books produced in America, but of 
the books that are the most distinctively repre- 
sentative of American life and thought. No 
doubt the two categories have much in common, 
but they will also diverge widely at several 
points. We think, for example, of Poe, Cooper, 
and Irving. They are among the best of our 
writers, but may we say that they are typically 
American in their spirit ? With respect to Poe 
the answer is quite clear that, as Professor 
Dowden puts it, " he would have differed little 
from his actual self had he been bom on an 
Irish hillside or in a German forest, or in any 
ultimate dim Thule, where it was possible for 
a dexterous brain to rehandle the suggestions 
of a subtle imagination." In the case of 
Cooper, there is a marked diversity of view. 
He was American in his themes (for the most 
part), and this seems to justify Professor 
Woodberry in saying that Cooper has given ua 
" the ideal type of the pioneer, of the white 
man in romantic contact with the wilderness, 
expanding into a new being and taking on a 
new form and opening up a new human capa- 
bility in character." But Dr. Hale, admitting 
the wide European acceptance of Cooper as • 
tjrpically American writer, is forced to almost 
exactly the opposite conclusion. " All the 
same," he says, "these novels are not really 
American, excepting that they tell about 
Indians and trails and blazed trees and rifles 
and buckshot and moccasins. There was no 
moment in Cooper's life when he would not 
have been pleased to be mistaken for an En- 
glishman." There is a somewhat similar dif- 



6

[Jan. 1, 



ference of opinion in the case of Irving. Mr. 
Wister remarks that " much of Irving could be 
English," and Professor Matthews thinks that, 
with Cooper, he must be ruled out because we 
can say no more for him than that he wrote "cer- 
tain books dealing delightfully with the exter- 
nals of American life." But Professor Wood- 
berry, having chiefly in view Irving's handling 
of the legendary material of his native State, 
makes the following strong plea for his Amer- 
icanism : 

'♦ Next in order comes that reincarnation of the world- 
old myth completely born again into local habitation 
and a name, Rip Van Winkle, in ' The Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow.' Such a birth is the rarest of literary phe- 
nomena, and stands in lieu of folk-lore, which never 
dies." 

Turning now to the instances of substantial 
agreement among our symposiasts, we find that 
Emerson's essays and Hawthorne's romances 
come foremost in the minds of nearly all of 
them. Concerning the former, Professor Miin- 
aterberg says : " It was always my opinion that 
no element of the American spirit is more es- 
sential than the often veiled idealism : I take 
Emerson's essays as its noblest literary docu- 
ment." And Professor Dowden says much the 
same thing in the following language : 

" A characteristic of much that strikes a stranger as 
indigenous in American literature is the juxtaposition, 
and at its best the fusion, in it of a very keen percep- 
tion of fact and of a lofty, sometimes a rarefied, kind of 
idealism. . . . The idealism of Emerson appears some- 
times to be highly attenuated, but at its best it is the 
exact translation of reality into what is yet more real — 
the idea." 

Of Hawthorne, and especially of " The Scarlet 
Letter," we are told by Colonel Higginson that 
*' all the volumes of all the historical societies 
cannot bring that remote atmosphere before us 
as he does." And Professor Dowden's dictum 
is this : 

" Add to New England vividness of perception and 
New England ideality a sentiment of romance to which 
the remoteness from the mediaeval world gives a certain 
wistfulness, and you have an expression for much that 
lay in the genius of Hawthorne." 

With something less of unanimity, but with 
no essential difference of opinion, we find the 
names of Lowell and Whitman put forward as 
representative of the typically American spirit 
in literature. " The Biglow Papers," says Col- 
onel Higginson, " takes the lead of unequivo- 
cally American books "; Dr. Hale calls them 
" absolutely characteristic "; and Professor 
Woodberry says that they " sum up Yankee 
nature with more telling effect than any of the 
pastoral writers who have used the form for 



political ends, nor is the work more loaded with 
dialect and contemporary detail than is cus- 
tomary in such compositions." Of Whitman's 
work, we are told by Professor Miiasterberg 
that it "tells the whole story" of "the demo- 
cratic temper of American society," by Pro- 
fessor Dowden that it makes " an effort to en- 
visage at once the vast materiality of the United 
States and to reveal the underlying spiritu- 
ality," and by Professor Matthews that it makes 
" plain the American acceptance of human 
equality, the fundamental respect for the dig- 
nity of the individual, and, above all, the superb 
belief in the future — the ingrained optimism 
which is perhaps the most salient element of 
our Americanism." 

Among the writers whose names find nu- 
merous champions in this competition for the 
honors of typical Americanism, and would 
doubtless be accepted by the others were not 
the selection so limited, are " Mark Twain," 
Thoreau, and Bret Harte. The first of these 
men, according to Professor Miinsterberg, 
stands for "American humor in its grotesque 
aspect of hearty laughter." Of Thoreau's 
" Walden," Colonel Higginson says that 
" neither its materials, nor its aims could have 
been combined elsewhere ; and the National 
life sings through it, precisely as the drum of 
the village youth, as described elsewhere by 
Thoreau, goes echoing through the darkness 
on the night before the village muster." And 
of Bret Harte we read in Mr. Garland's words, 
to which no one can object, that his prose and 
verse " sprang from the soil of the Pacific 
slope as naturally as its pines and redwoods; 
in them is the old California." 

A large number of books and authors not 
heretofore mentioned are named by one or 
another of the contributors to the discussion. 
Among the books most clearly entitled to in- 
clusion in a representative list are Whittier's 
" Snowbound," Longfellow's "Hiawatha," Mr. 
Howells's "Silas Lapbam,"Judd'8 "Margaret," 
Holmes's " Autocrat," " Uncle Tom's Cabin," 
and the histories of Parkman and Fiske. Of 
" Snowbound," Colonel Higginson says that 
" there is not in all literature, probably, a 
family group so graphically and indeed im- 
mortally portrayed." Of " Hiawatha," Pro- 
fessor Woodberry says that " the world has 
found this white man's epic of the dying race 
of the forest-dwellers the single poetic embodi- 
ment of the Indian world, and no savage world 
has ever attracted the imagination and sym- 
pathy of men as strongly as the Indian."

THE DIAI. 



" The Puritan oonscientiuusDess," saya Profes- 
sor Miiosterberg, is " perhaps nowhere char- 
acterized with finer artistic qaality than in 
• Silas Lapham/ " Of " Margaret," Dr. Hale 
says that the book had better be hunted up 
by " anybody outside of New England who 
wants a oompiehensive idea of New England 
character in the active duties of New England 
life a hundred years ago." The " Autocrat," 
according to Professor Miinsterberg, embodies 
American humor in its ''smilingly sentimental" 
aspect. "Uncle Tom's Cabin," says Professor 
Wood berry, " for better or worse, has been 
and will remain the picture of the South under 
slavery, of the slave, the master, and the life." 
Finally, it is Dr. Hale who argues most elo- 
quently for the American school of historians: 
for Parkman, whom he styles " the most dis- 
tinctly American author in this American 
school," for Fiske, "who compels people to read 
American history who never read it before." 

A distinctive feature of this discussion is 
the recognition it gives to the literary work of 
our great statesmen and patriots. Miss Grace 
King speaks of the period of the Revolution 
as '• the classical era of our patriotic genius," 
and the names of Henry, Franklin, and Web- 
ster, of Washington, Lincoln, and Grant, 
appear many times among the chosen repre- 
sentatives of American spirit. Dr. Hale even 
insists upon the Constitution as one of his 
ten typically American books. Grant, in par- 
ticular, both for his memoirs and his despatches, 
is singled out by a number of the contributors, 
in which connection we may recall the high 
praise bestowed upon the •' Memoirs " by no 
less a critic than Matthew Arnold. We come 
aeross an occasional " freak " judgment, as in 
the case of Colonel Higginson's mention of 
Miss Helen Kellar's " The Story of my Life," 
and of Mr. Garland's word for such writers as 
Mr. Kiley and Mr. Ade. And Professor Mnn- 
sterberg indulges in a little fun at our expense 
when he says that " A book like Mrs. Eddy's 
' Science and Health ' might be written any- 
where: but that it should be bought by the 
hundred thousand is possible only through the 
mental disposition of Americans."' As an ex- 
ample of the books that embody the defects of 
our national virtues, this amazing performance 
may also be called a characteristic production 
of the American spirit. 

In conclusion, we wish to supplement our 
series of special quotations by two excerpts of 
a more general character, one from an Amer- 
ican, and the other from an English observer. 



Mr. Owen Wister pertinently says of the Amer- 
ican spirit : 

"First, it has Youth. We are a jmn^ natwn, and 
poMfM the joQDg virtues and the j-oangfaoUs; the hope, 
the dariog, the generosity, the extravagaaee, the impa- 
tience, the irreverenee of yoath. Bat, next, we are an 
old peopU — Faiitans, Hngoenots; and this means fatal- 
ism, subtlety, a strange sadness, a pondering the prob- 
lem of evil, a power of asceticism, and of exaltation." 

Professor Dowden's general comment is as 
follows : 

" Perhaps the theory is trae that American idealism 
can be traced in part to Puritanism, and that what we 
mar call a defecated Puritanism becomes almost inev- 
itably a cult of the ideal. Tocqueville will have it, and 
perhaps he is right, that a great democracy is in its very 
nature prone to ideal ways of thinking and feeling, with 
results at once reassuring and open to the gravest risks. 
But the qnick recognition of facts, and the shrewdness, 
the stability, which this engenders is a cheek upon the 
dangers which are perhaps inherent in a democracy. " 



D'ANNUNZIO. POET AND 
PLAYWBIGHT. 



In America, and also in Europe outside of Italy, 
d'AnnuDzio'B fame prior to the publication of Fran^ 
eesea da Birnini. has been as a novelist. It is now 
seven or eight years since the Same det Deux 
Monde* published "The Triumph of Death," and 
M. de Vogne hailed him as the leader of an Italian 
Benaisganee. From that time, his novels have bean 
famous throughout £arop>e and America ; whereas 
his poetry has been scarcely known except in Italy. 
To Italians, however, at least to his disciples and 
their friends, d'Annnnzio, even in his novels, is 
essentially a poet. 

It is not easy for an American, bred in the habits, 
notions, and prejadiees which we call Anglo-Saxon 
education, to be just to d'Annunuo, even as a poet ; 
for we are almost sure to approach his poetry 
through his novels, and these revolt all oar natural 
sentiments. We are separated from him by the 
gulf of race. Even his virtues, in great part, are 
beyond our sympathies ; for we, on our side, do not 
belong to the gentil sangue Latin, nor do we 
understand d'Annansio's most sincere, most praise- 
worthy trait, — the conscience of the artist, a con- 
science as imperious, as self-sufficient, as disdainful 

I as that of the Puritans. 

' To d'AnnuDzio himself, his aim is spiritual ; yet 
to say in English that d'AnnnDzio labors for the 
spiritual life is to impose a strange burden upon those 
already heavily laden words. His understanding 
of the spirit is di£Perent from ours ; Americans are 
prone to separate the spiritual from the intellectaal, 
d'Annnnzio is inclined to confound the two. He 
aims to enfranchise the intellect, to rescue it from 
the bonds of an ignorant social order, to enlarge the 
horizon of men by poetry. For him, intellectual 
exploitation of the senses is spiritual, it is man's 



8

highest life ; and the expression of that intellectual 
enjoyment is poetry. He is a great artist ; he has 
propriety, order, gradation, harmony, in word and 
thought ; instinctively he shudders at formlessness. 
He is not inspired ; he is the product of modern cul- 
ture, not a natural force expressing itself under the 
ordinary impulses of life. He has lived more on other 
men's thoughts than on his own ; a careful perusal of 
his books shows the periods in which different mas- 
ters were in the ascendant. He has not the power of 
assimilation, that predatory habit of happy genius 
bestowed upon a Raphael or a Keats ; on the con- 
trary, his very lack of capacity to force the ideas 
and methods of other men to deny their creators, as it 
were, and serve him, marks the limit of his genius. 
Nevertheless he has a clever knack of cribbing. 

At sixteen d'Annunzio had become famous; critics 
jostled each other in their hurry to be the first to 
do him honor. He went from success to success ; and 
from 1881 his poems have been hailed, one after 
the other, as the work of a rival to Carducci. 

A lyric poet is, and must be, exaggeratedly per- 
sonal in his relations to us ; we like him, or we do 
not, for causes that lie deep in ourselves. We like 
him, perhaps, because he has unlocked, by a mere 
random sequence of words, some old neglected 
memory, or stirred a common human sentiment and 
left us less lonely, or because he has pulled aside 
the curtain of familiarity from something of beauty. 
With d'Annunzio, it is not so. From the first, we 
feel in our bones that he cannot be our poet. We 
are oppressed by the hard lustre of his Latin genius, 
that shines so glaringly, and disregards the gray 
tints which we love, and all the pleasant sombreness 
of life. But no doubt we fall short in our duty as 
readers ; his art fails in its effect upon us because 
' we are not sensitive to it, our drowsy susceptibilities 
sleep through his knocking. We feel that he is a 
stranger to the haunts of our affections ; he utters 
many melodious phrases, but not our pass-word; he is 
challenged by our rude dumb instincts, which know 
that he has no part in the patriotism of our souls. 

Whether he is our poet or not, his is a very in- 
teresting personality. Behind his sensuous descrip- 
tions is not feeling, but intellect ; behind his intellect 
is not genius, but a Roman will, which joins with 
his ambition in high resolve to achieve a new life 
for Italy, and wills to use poetry as its instrument. 
Nevertheless, will and intellect, applied to lyrical 
talents, will not, without the addition of experience, 
turn a poet into a playwright ; and in d'Annunzio's 
plays we miss experience of the stage. He should 
have been apprenticed to a scene-shifter, cursed by 
the stage-manager, bullied by the second lady, and 
thus have acquired the lore of stage-craft. No 
genius can supply the lack of long familiarity with 
the stage. Of such knowledge the novelist, who 
desires to become a playwright, and more than all 
others the psychological novelist, stands in especial 
need : in the drama, living actors are the medium 
of expression ; in story-telling, printer's ink, — and 
the difference is immense. 



Among the defects of d'Annunzio's novels are 
intense subjectiveness, narrowness of human inter- 
est, and an indefatigable prolixity. The same 
defects hurt his plays ; but the exigencies of the 
stage have helped him ; they limit, if they cannot 
abolish, the author's soliloquies, and they discourage 
prolixity. His earlier plays. La Gioconda and 
Citth Morta, mark the period of his apprentice- 
ship. The plot of La Gioconda is briefly this : A 
sculptor moulds a beautiful statue ; during the work 
the model acquires a power over the sculptor, so 
that without her he is incapable of achievement. 
Soon he finds himself in love with her and estranged 
from his wife, who is both good and beautiful. The 
mental strain of this situation makes him danger- 
ously ill. His wife, by her devoted nursing, saves 
his life; and thinking that illness has broken his 
illegitimate bonds, confronts the model and attempts 
to send her away. In this scene the wife and the 
model are merely the sculptor's emotions personified: 
one representing duty to art, a duty which only 
the chosen few can perform ; the other, that com- 
mon duty to a wife which lies within the reach of 
every husband. The wife tells a lie, saying that 
her husband had commanded the model to depart. 
In a rage of despair, the model springs forward to 
break the statue for which she had sat ; the wife 
throws out her arms and saves the falling marble 
from breaking, but her hands are horribly maimed 
and have to be amputated. The victory is with the 
model. 

In this play d'Annunzio has chosen the tragic 
and ethical theme that a man cannot serve two 
masters ; but in his endeavor to portray an ethical 
situation he has only succeeded at the expense of 
human interest. The two women who struggle for 
the artist's soul are but two conflicting moral prin- 
ciples, and nobody cares what becomes of the soul. 

La Citth Morta ("The Dead City ") is a play 
of greater ambition. D'Annunzio has attempted 
what he perhaps would call a younger sister to the 
Attic dramas; he has taken what he believes to be 
a Greek theme, and in order to strengthen his situ- 
ation he has laid the scene near Mycense. The 
characters are a poet, his blind wife and a brother 
and sister engaged in excavating the tombs of 
Agamemnon and Cassandra. Both husband and 
brother fall, in love with the sister; there is no 
action ; the brother, overcome by horror at his own 
love, and not untouched with jealousy, drowns his 
sister. The horror of the plot is dulled by prolixity, 
and by the lack of human interest in the characters 
(dreams of a morbid scholar), who spend their im- 
mense leisure in talking of the Antigone, of Cas- 
sandra, of the plains of Argos and the gulf of 
Corinth, not for the menial purpose of carrying 
forward the plot, but to awake a chill sense of the 
past, and to recall the cold presence of the long 
dead. 

Tragedy requires some unreality ; it requires iso- 
lation from 'daily life, whose unheroic little needs 
comfort humanity and spoil tragedy ; but the

strained qaalitj of d'Annanzio does not transport 
as into the heroic anreality of Attic tragedy, it only 
carries us into a breezeless atmosphere of morbid 
fwychologr. The play is a mere ftndy of abnormal 
psychic conditions, too abnormal for general interest. 
too subjective for the stage, from which both it and 
La Gioconda would be promptly banished were it 
not for the self-sacrifice of the great actress who has 
devoted her ten talents to their service. 

The plot of " Francesca da Rimini " is briefly 
this : For political reasons Francesca's family, the 
Polentani. lords of Ravenna, desire to marry her to 
Oianciotto, the oldest son of Malatesta of Rimini ; 
bnt they fear her ref asal, as Gianeiotto is both lame 
*nd ill-favored ; therefore they trick her into the 
belief that Paolo the beaatiful, his younger brother, 
is to be her hagband. Francesca is betrothed, goes 
to Rimini and there is undeceived ; but that first 
belief, that Paolo was to be hers and she his. avenges 
itself, and the two love each other from that mo- 
ment. The youngest brother, Malatestino, who 
attempts to pay his addresses to his beautiful sister- 
in-law and is repulsed, betrays the lovers to Gian- 
eiotto. Dramatic interest centres in four figures. 
Francesca and the three brothers. Gianeiotto is a 
Renaissance despot^ who limps across the stage in 
vigorous fashion. He is well done, but he suffers 
in English eyes in that, while his fierceness and 
lameness and ambition recall Richard III., he has 
not the interest of inhumanity, he is not turned devil 
by physical defects ; he is but a rude soldier, roughly 
seeking to despoil his neighbor. 

The best-drawn character is that of Malatestino, 
who in a few rude sentences reveals the traditional 
Renaissance ferocity. Paolo is inferior, he is the 
palest of all d'Annunzio's likeneg»eg of himself, too 
little individual, too much the attendant character 
to Francesca ; he is a poseur, weak with the ordi- 
nary weaknesses of a jeune premier, and his very 
ineffectiveness puts him beyond the reach of tragedy. 
He lores Francesca, but his love does not bear 
marks of fatality, or if so, of a fatality that to day 
sweeps him to Francesca, and to-morrow will sweep 
him to Giovanna, and the next to Lucia, and so 
onward still. The interest in an adulterer must lie 
in the clash between duty to love and doty to honor, 
when " honor rooted in dishonor stands "; but Paolo 
is nnvexed by any sentiment of disloyalty to his 
brother. 

Francesca is a more interesting figure, but she is 
not essentially different from d'Annunzio's other 
heroines. At home in Ravenna she has fed on tales 
of old romance told by an Eastern slave, and lived 
in day-dreams colored by a melancholy foreboding. 
She falls in love with Paolo at first sight ; and as 
her tricky marriage to Gianeiotto leaves her in 
doubt as to whom her allegiance is due, she is sub- 
ject to an ethical bewilderment of which Paolo is 
unconscious. In her speeches there are passages of 
real poetry ; and sometimes, when pathos colors the 
lines, they nestle in the memory with true lyric 
confidence. 



Bat everywhere, over every scene, over every 
person, hangs prolixity like a pall. Just as interest 
rises, just as pity stirs, comes a cold shower of 
words, that strew the ground like leaves in Vallom- 
broga. smothering interegt. choking pity, till nothing 
but that resolution which is said to be the character- 
istic of our dominant race enables us to be patient 
to the end. The first act, which only serves to let 
Francesca and Paolo see each other, and to inform 
the spectators that she believes he is to be her hus- 
band, begins with a gay and distinctly long scene 
between the waiting-women and the jongleur; it 
goes on with an unnecessary episode about Fran- 
cesca's brother, introduced to produce historical 
effect, and continues with a long discourse between 
Francesca and her sister, and only ends when 
Francesca sees Paolo at the gate ; fortunately, they 
say nothing, and the curtain drops. In the other 
acta are a long apostrophe to Greek fire, a minute 
examination of a peddlar's pack, made with the leis- 
ure of a lady when society is out of town, and the 
story of a hawk ; all scenes which are adapted for 
a novel, but deadly for a play. Yet, with all its 
faults, if a tyrannical stage-manager were to take 
the play with earte blanche to eat, and should do 
his obvious duty, this play woald remain andoobt- 
edly the best tragedy ever produced in Italy, and 
would rank high on the English stage. 

D'Annunzio has made an immense effort to se- 
cure fidelity to fact ; he has thrown himself with his 
wonted zeal into arras, headdress, mangonel, cross- 
bow, hawking, and haberdashery ; he has pressed into 
service jongleur, peddlar, and astrologer, and no 
doubt he has made a good picture of life in Rimini 
near the year 1300. The scenes are brilliant, and 
might have been drawn by Boccaccio ; they fumiah 
a very beautiful and finished frame for the tragedy. 
D'Annunzio himself recognizes the danger of too 
many accessories, and in order to overcome that 
danger and to give to his drama a touch of poetic 
ambience, of that detachment from the world which 
tragedy requires, he adopts ingenuous devices. He 
naes ref>etition, which, like a succession of echoes, 
confounds the memory and the imagination and 
serves as a fair makeshift for the presence of mys- 
tery. He also introduces snatches from Dante which 
recall the solemnity of the eternal punishment that 
lies before the lovers. And everywhere be is the 
aitist. Every scene, every speech, every word, is 
put in nice relation to the whole ; no volunteer 
phrases come straggling in, — they are drilled, 
equipped, and marched into place, in accordance 
with a carefully matured plan. 

It is interesting to gee how d'Annunzio has been 
both hurt and helped by the greatest of Italian 
poets. Dante has rendered d'Annunzio's historical 
accuracy, at least for the reader in his closet, hope- 
lessly wrong. Paolo and Franceses, the lovers 
whom we know, are not historical ; they are not 
Riminesi. but Dantesque. They did not live in the 
flesh, but in the greatest lines of the Divine Com- 
edy. They are apparitions, beautified and idealized

by the genius of Dante, endowed with such life and 
experience as he gave them, and no more. They 
live forever on the infernal blast, and there is a 
hopeless incongruity in surrounding them with 
antique furniture and mediaeval millinery. But 
d'AnnuDzio has also received a blessing; he has 
* " touched Dante's dead," and he has acquired a 
modesty that seemed beyond his power ; for a mo- 
ment he has seen a glimmer, as it were, of Dante's 
belief that the bond of sex is but a rude symbol of 
a completer union where the individual shall no 
longer be isolated by his own imprisoning senses. 
And yet we cannot but resent as impiety that a 
man should be so rash as to overstep by a hair's 
breadth the prohibition in the line, 

Qael giorno pia non vi leggemmo avanti, 
(That day we read no more therein.) 

The end of the play is weak. Paolo attempts to 
escape down a trap-door, and is caught by some 
mediaeval equivalent for coat-tails, leaving head and 
shoulders standing out; from this ignominious and 
somewhat ludicrous position he must be rescued, in 
order that he and Francesca may die in each other's 
arms. Gianciotto pulls him up by the hair, and 
then runs him through. 

In spite of all, this play is far and away d'An- 
nunzio's best achievement ; it is more interesting, 
more a£fecting, mure virile than his other dramas 
or his novels ; it is more human, and has a sensu- 
ous richness and an orderly advance that mark a 
great gain indramatic art. This improvement comes 
in part from the poet's growth in knowledge and 
experience ; but we must also look further, for 
neither in novel nor in drama has there been 
promise of such a sudden leap forward, and surely 
we can detect the advice of trained experience and 
the promptings of a delicacy and tact which can 
only belong to the great actress, Eleanora Duse 
dalle belle mani; so that we may ascribe the play 
to what Charles Lamb calls the noble practise of 



collaboration.

LAMB MANUSCRIPTS IN AMERICA. 
(To the Editor of The Dial. ) 
In the work of preparing the new edition of the Let- 
ters of Charles and Mary Lamb, upon which I have been 
engaged for some years, I have endeavored wherever 
possible to obtain new copies of letters rather than re- 
produce those which are already in type. English pos- 
sessors of Lamb MSS. having most cordially assisted 
me in this project, I take the opportunity of asking 
those owners of Lamb MSS. in America to be so good 
as to extend to me the same facilities ; for without their 
cooperation no edition of Lamb's letters can possibly be 
complete. I shall be obliged if they will kindly ad-

James Martineau.* 



The story is told of an old lady who derived 
great comfort and help from a borrowed vol- 
ume of Martineau's sermons until one day she 
learned, to her horror, that they were by a 
Unitarian, when she speedily returned the book 
to its owner, remarking that the effect of its 
reading was like that of a pleasant poison. 

Probably no collection of sermons has im- 
parted more of spiritual uplift to a wide circle 
of readers than the two volumes of " Endeav- 
ours after a Christian Life." Their entire 
freedom from doctrinal discussion, and their 
moving appeal to our common religious nature 
and aspirations, render them fit reading for all. 
Their poetic beauty of diction makes each chap- 
ter a " lyric utterance," which was the author's 
ideal of what a sermon should be. Like Chan- 
ning and like Theodore Parker, with whom he 
is naturally associated as one of the three lead- 
ers of liberal religious thought in the nineteenth 
century, Martineau was a vehement protestant 
against everything that savors of arbitrary 
authority in religion. With them, too, he pro- 
tested against certain tendencies in the Uni- 
tarian church that seemed to him narrow and 
injurious. So catholic was he in matters of 
religion that he disliked the idea of any less 
inclusive ecclesiastical organization than that 
of the church universal ; and though he called 
himself & Unitarian, he did not favor the name 
as a denominational label. These points of 
similarity between the three champions of Uni- 
tarianism serve well to indicate wherein reside 
the real strength and usefulness of that denomi- 
nation, its true mission being to liberalize the 
church as a whole, and to promote Christian 
unity, rather than to gain converts to its own 
specific form of faith. 

We have long had on our bookshelves ample 
biographies of Channing and Parker. To them 
is now added a full and painstaking life of 
Martineau, who, it is curious to recall, was born 
five years before Parker and only twenty-five 
after Channing. The scholarly study of Mar- 
tineau from the pen of the Rev. A. W. Jackson, 
published two years ago, was necessarily mea- 
gre iu biographical detail ; so that, while it is

by DO means superseded, it is very acceptably 
4npplemented bv the later work. Both Dr. 
Drammood and Professor Upton had long been 
associated with Martineau as officers of Man- 
chester College, and no men better fitted for 
the preparation of his biography could have 
been found. The " Life and Letters " occupy 
the first volume and half of the second ; the 
*' Survey of his Philosophical Work " is crowded 
into the remaining half-volume. 

In a letter to the Eev. W. R. Alger, Mar- 
tineau speaks of " a certain loneliness of spirit " 
that had been his from childhood. It is this 
loneliness of spirit, or, better expressed, this 
loftiness of spirituality, that renders him an 
anpromising subject for popular biography. 
His life is traced in his thought and in his 
writings ; the accidental shifting of the bodily 
tenement from Norwich to Bristol, from Bristol 
to York, to Dublin. Liverpool, London, signi- 
fies but little. Harriet Martineaus autobiog- 
raphy long ago made us familiar with the more 
important features of the family history. That 
heroic struggle on the children's part to clear 
an honored father's name from the reproach of 
insolvency, was vividly depicted by her. The 
present biographer, strangely enough, passes 
over this period with merely a brief mention of 
straitened circumstances. The noble and self- 
sacrificing conduct of young Mr. Martineau 
in resigning his Dublin pastorate, because he 
could not conscientiously accept the regium 
donum, is described in detail. A fall accoant 
also is given of the so-called Liverpool Con- 
troversy, in which Martineau, now pastor of 
the Paradise Street Chapel, united with the 
two other liberal dissenting ministers of the 
city in defending their common faith against 
a venomous assault from thirteen Anglican 
clergymen. The fortunes of Manchester Col- 
lege (afterward Manchester New College, and 
then again known under its original name) are 
rather closely followed in this biography of 
him who most contributed to its success as a 
theological school for dissenters. From Man- 
chester to York, thence back to Manchester, 
thence to London, and finally to Oxford, the 
•college wandered in quest of a permanent abid- 
ing place. Associated with it as a student at 
York, as a lecturer at Manchester, and as pro- 
fessor and afterward principal in London, 
Martineau has linked his name inseparably 
with its history. It was in his work as pro- 
fessor of mental and moral philosophy that he 
first drew the attention of the learned world to 
his depth and power of thought. Though public 



recognition of his extraordinary abilities came 
late in life, it came at last in fuU measure. 
America honored herself by being the first to 
bestow on him an honorary degree. In 1872 
Harvard made him a doctor of laws ; Leyden 
followed three years later with a doctorate of 
systematic theology ; Edinburgh added D.D. 
to his name in 1884 ; Oxford came lagging 
along in 1888 with a D.C.L. diploma ; and 
Dublin brought up the rear in 1892 by append- 
ing Litt.D, to the list. 

It has often been said, and with good reason, 
that had Martineau stood within the pale of 
the English church he would have been made 
Archbishop of Canterbury. Even English 
churchmen, as well as dissenters, have called 
him the foremost philosophical and religious 
thinker of his time. But with British con- 
servatism and British prejudice to contend 
against, the wonder is not so much that he 
was late in attaining such recognition as he 
finally enjoyed, as that he attained it at all. 
The extent of his influence and the perma- 
nent value of his work are undoubtedly out 
of all proportion to the honors he reaped 
while alive. Most gratifying was the tribute 
of "reverence and affection " paid to him 
on his eighty-third birthday in an address 
signed by a host of men of renown in learn- 
ing and in public life, both in Europe and in 
America. The signatures, though somewhat 
hastily gathered, numbered six hundred and 
fifty. The noble and touching reply to this 
address deserves quotation here in full, but 
unwillingness to trespass too greatly on edi- 
torial courtesy forbids, and to present the re- 
sponse in an abridged form were almost a sin. 
We cannot, however, close this inadequate 
notice of a permanently valuable work without 
offering the reader a taste of Martineau's ex- 
quisitely finished literary style. His letters 
lend themselves most readily to purposes of 
illustration. Dignified modesty and courtly 
grace distinguished them in a marked degree. 
To the Rev. Paul Revere Frothingham he 
wrote, in March, 1893, a letter highly char- 
acteristic of his attitude in denominational 
matters. 

" This summer will probably draw joa for a time 
into the great vortex of the Chicago meeting of the 
waters, — the vast sweep of which, I most confess, 
rather terrifies than exalts mj imagination. I can 
place as little trnst in saeh ' Parliaments of all Reli- 
gions ' as in an Ecamenical Council. All theological 
assemblies that I have ever attended, or distantly ob- 
served, have created more differentiation than anion. It 
is the unspoken religion that lies beneath all words, in

which we are one; and it passes the wit of man to define 
without separating. Whatever temporal benefits may 
accrue from a concentrated exhibition of the industry 
and arts of all nations, I cannot be sanguine in my ex- 
pectation of its spiritual result." 

A quiet humor, of which he not infrequently 
showed himself master, lights up the following, 
written from Berlin, where he spent a semester 
of study in 1848-49. Frequenters of German 
university lecture-rooms will give it an appre- 
ciative reading. 

" I have heard Neander lecture, though I have not 
met him in private. . . . His lectures are interesting 
from their matter, and [from] the neatness approaching 
to elegance of expression, somewhat diffused, however, 
and delivered in a manner so peculiar as to defy con- 
ception. A little shy-looking man, with a quantity of 
black hair, and eyes so small and overshadowed by dark 
brows as to be invisible, slinks into a great lecture- 
room; steps up to his platform; but instead of taking 
his professor's chair, takes his station at the corner of 
his tall desk, leaning his arm upon the angle, and his 
head upon his arm ; with his face thus banging over the 
floor, and pulling a pen to pieces with his fingers, he be- 
gins to rock his desk backwards and forwards on its hind 
edge with every promise of a bouleversement, and talks 
smoothly, as he rocks, for his three-quarters of an hour, 
without a scrap of paper; quoting authorities, chapter 
and verse, and even citing and translating longtsh pas- 
sages from ecclesiastical writers; and finishing every 
clause by spitting, in a quiet dropping way upon the 
floor, as if to express the punctuation. When the clock 
strikes, the demolition of the pen is just complete, and 
he slinks out of the room without apparently having 
once been conscious that anybody was present." 

Professor Upton's survey of Martineau's 
philosophical work is, from its brevity, neces- 
sarily somewhat cursory, and may well be sup- 
plemented by Mr. Jackson's careful, though less 
comprehensive, study. Four portraits of Mar- 
tineau accompany the text, the latest showing 
him in his ninety-fourth year ; but the fine 
face still wears much of the wintry grace of 
unenfeebled age. Percy F. Bicknell. 



A New History of German Literature.* 



The announcement of Mr. John G. Robert- 
son's " History of German Literature " was 
received with more than ordinary interest, for, 
excepting Francke's " German Literature as 
Determined by Social Forces," no English book 
of similar scope has appeared. The author, for 
a number of years past Lecturer in the Uni- 
versity of Strassburg, has enjoyed excellent op- 
portunities for the prosecution of his work, and 
certainly the handsome volume, from the press 
of Messrs. Blackwood & Sons, challenges care-

Robertson. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



ful examination. In all that belongs to th& 
technique of book-making, there is no oppor- 
tunity for adverse criticism. A taseful binding, 
clear type, and good paper make the book at- 
tractive ; while a table of contents, marginal 
catch-words, and an excellent index, the latter 
distinguishing by heavy type between detailed 
treatment and incidental mention, supply all the 
aid needed for convenient and ready reference. 

Turning now to the subject-matter itself, the 
question of proportion first suggests itself; and, 
in this connection, a detailed statement of what 
Mr. Robertson has given us is in order. An 
Introduction of ten or twelve pages deals in a 
general way with the relation of German to 
other literatures, and seeks to establish " in 
how far divergences in the evolution of Ger- 
man letters are to be ascribed to national tem- 
perament, in how far to accidents of social or 
political history." The balance of the book, 
something over six hundred octavo pages, is 
then divided into five parts of varying length, 
each subdivided into separate chapters. The 
first part, dealing with the Old High German 
period, is quite brief, — only thirty-three pages j 
the Middle High German and Early New High 
German periods are somewhat more fully 
treated, — one hundred pages being given to 
the former, and to the latter ninety. The four- 
teen chapters of Part Four devote one hundred 
and seventy-five pages to the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury ; while fullest of all is the treatment of the 
Nineteenth Century, in sixteen chapters, con- 
taining two hundred and thirteen pages. This 
arrangement is commendable. Most of the 
standard works in German end with Goethe's 
death, or, like Meyer's recent work, devote a 
stout volume to the Nineteenth Century alone. 
The general reader thus finds what is of the 
greatest contemporary interest untouched, or 
so exhaustively treated that, apart from any 
question of the perfect mastery of the foreign 
idiom needed to consult such works, he is de- 
terred from undertaking the task. 

Equally commendable is the brevity with 
which the Old High German period is treated. 
Monuments like the Hildehrandslied and the 
Heljand are given their due importance, but 
Mr. Robertson properly appreciates, without 
under-estimating, this early literature. His con- 
clusion is worth quoting. 

" It is in no sense a great period ; with the excep- 
tion of a few fragmentary verses. . . . Old High Ger- 
man literature has little or no poetic worth. . . . The 
interest which it possesses for us to-day is not literary 
but linguistic." 

It may seem unnecessary to emphasize this point.

bat BO many historians of literatare have nn- 
duly exaggerated the importance of this period, 
as the survival of epoch-making centuries, 
that the student is often in danger of gettiog 
a wrong perspective. 

In the arrangement of his subject-matter 
Mr. Robertson is not always quite so happy, 
though that certainly is a very difficult thing. 
The separate chapters in each division of the 
book deal with different movements, or some- 
times with a single work or author ; and this 
arrangement is, of course, logical. But there 
seems to be a lack of sufficient emphasis on 
social and political tendencies, a failure to make 
clear the character of each trend or school and 
its relation to what came before and what fol- 
lowed it. It hardly seems that the student would 
get from the book as definite an idea of the 
various movements and the organic develop- 
ment of German literature as, for example, Mr. 
Stopford Brooke's " Primer " gives of the 
English. The author's attitude is defined in 
the concluding sentence of his Introduction, 
summing up, as it does, the whole preceding 
discussion. 

" Jast as the histori&n of French literature mast 
keep coDst&DtlT in view the social background, or as 
English literary history must take account of the nat- 
oral enterprise and independence of the Anglo-Saxon 
race, so German literatare must be regarded preemi- 
nently as the literature of subjectivity and individ- 
nalism." 

Now the general troth of this may be frankly 
admitted, yet it is equally true that various 
infiuences have effected not merely individuals 
but whole periods and all the writers of a given 
epoch, — as, for example, the Storm and Stress 
movement. This movement is frequently re- 
ferred to as something definite and well under- 
stood ; but in his chapter on it Mr. Robertson 
describes it only as " another expression for 
youthful vigor," and characterizes it as the 
period of " genius." which owed its tendency 
and peculiar stamp to the influence of the 
ideas and work of Rousseau. This is quite 
inadequate. Other allusions indicate the au- 
thor's clear perception of the other features of 
this movement, but all of these should have 
been brought together into one clear presenta- 
tion of its nature and scope. 

It is perhaps along this same line that what 
seems the greatest fault of the work is to be 
found; its perusal fails to give definite and clear 
impressions of the works described. There is 
too much of general statement and abstract 
criticism, too little direct analysis of the litera- 
ture in question and of the appeal it has made 



to the author: himself. Thus, for example, in 
the treatment of Schiller's "Maria Stuart," the 
old point that the poet has not utilized the 
political situation is urged. Mr. Robertson 
certainly is familiar with the poet's statement 
implying his purpose to write a tragedy of hu- 
man passion, and knows that he intentionally 
passed over the political elements, finding in his 
historical background simply a check upon his 
imagination. When thus interpreted, the stric- 
ture that Mary's death '* is an accident, not a 
necessity " is not well founded, for the issue is 
distinctly the result of her own action in the 
drama. 

In similar fashion, tiie analysis of Goethe's 
Jphigenie avf Tavris misses the central 
thought that gives unity to the whole plot, — 
Iphigenie's belief that Diana has protected her 
in order that she may return to Greece and 
atone the guilt of her race. Without due em- 
phasis npon this, the student gets no clear idea 
of Goethe's plot, and thus wholly misses much 
of the significance of what onr author justly 
considers " the most artistically perfect, the 
most spiritnal, of all the poet's writings." 

One further illustration of this lack of clear 
presentation of vital issues. In speaking of 
Lessing's great controversy with Goeze, Mr. 
Robertson simply says that " the Fragments 
discussed religious questions in a rationalistic 
spirit " with which Lessing sympathized ; he 
then mentions only by title the writings called 
forth in the controversy. Now this is an insuf- 
ficient treatment of a struggle in which Lessing 
finally vanquished the literalism of dogmatic 
Lutheran orthodoxy and reasserted Luther's 
great principle of individual inquiry. The 
close relation of this straggle to y^aihan der 
Weise is also not suggested ; and certainly 
that poem stands for something more than 
"lofty humanity and wise tolerance." Professor 
Carruth's admirable article on '• The Three 
Rings " puts the teaching of the drama in its 
proper light 

One or two other points linger in mind after 
laying aside the volume. The discussion of the 
Nibdungenlied might well trace more clearly 
the mythical and the historical elements and 
their union in the German saga. In the treat- 
ment of Luther, too, is he not credited with 
greater originality in his use of the Saxon 
'• Kanzlei " than he deserves ? Recent studies 
of the work of Thomas Murner would seem to 
indicate as much. But enough of this un- 
grateful fault-finding. The book does not show 
marked originality in its presentation or strong

individuality in its appreciations and judg- 
ments, but perhaps for that very reason it will 
be all the more useful as a work of reference ; 
and that, after all, is its chief purpose. 

From this latter point of view one additional 
feature of the work merits unqualified approval, 
— namely, the references in the foot-notes to the 
works consulted and to the editions used ; also 
the extracts that are incorporated in the text. 
As far as possible, Kiirschner's Deutsche Na- 
tional- Litter atur is cited, since that series can 
be found in every larger library. The extracts 
from Old and Middle High German are also 
literally rendered into modern German in the 
notes, the author's purpose being to furnish a 
glossary rather than a translation. That he 
did this is additional evidence of that sense for 
style that characterizes the whole work, and 
every good teacher will certainly agree with 
him that this method is better adapted to en- 
able the reader " to appreciate the meaning and 
poetic value of the extracts " than any English 
translation that could be offered. 

All in all, Mr. Robertson deserves high 
praise for the work he has done. It shows 
wide reading and painstaking scholarship, and 
both English and American students of Ger- 
man literature are to be congratulated upon the 
publication of so good a book.

IjOWell. on Human IiiBEKTY.» 



While the collection and publication of the 
early anti-slavery writings of James Russell 
Lowell must rejoice every lover of human lib- 
erty, it is a matter for sincere regret that the 
edition in which these contributions to the great 
cause of freedom are issued should be a limited 
one. For if ever the thinking people of the 
United States and, more particularly, those 
among them who direct the thought of their 
fellow-citizens, needed just such fundamental 
statements of right and wrong and the true 
glory of nations, it is in this very day when the 
evil of the world is masquerading once more 
in the guise of a " higher morality." More 
than one reader who has strayed into the dim 
and littlekuown regions of our national history 
just before and during the war with Mexico 
has been struck with the extraordinary resem- 
blance between the protest and apology of con-

Riverside Press (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). 



flicting political parties in that day to those in 
this. Many, too, seeing that the Mexican war 
has not resulted in unmixed evil, and that the 
conquests it made have not wholly reacted 
against the march of civilization, argue thence 
that the protestants of this day are also mere 
carping critics, stumbling blocks in the path 
of progress, as those were who fought against 
the admission of Texas and the taking over by 
conquest of lands from the weak republic to 
the south. 

It requires the unflinching courage and 
youthful enthusiasm of so true a man and so 
forceful a writer as Lowell to puncture such 
fallacies. One realizes that the wrong of those 
days has made easier the commission of wrong 
in these ; that the eternal heresy of doing evil 
that right may come was buttressed anew ; that 
the only too human notion that success is the 
test by which the worth of men's deeds may be 
weighed was given an authority which gains in 
these days because it stands as a precedent. 
In Lowell's own majestic phrase, one sees anew 

"Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne." 

It is pleasant to learn from the brief un- 
signed introduction to the present reprint of 
these anti-slavery papers that they came to be 
written through the influence of that gentle and 
God-fearing woman, Maria White, to whom 
Lowell had just before been married. 

"Through all the earlier papers runs the fiery zeal 
which we are accustomed to attribute to the young con- 
vert. The implication would seem to be a just one; for 
the first of the articles was written soon after Lowell's 
marriage to Maria White, to whom, in Mr. Norton's 
words, he ' owed all that a man may owe to the woman he 
loves.' . . . We have his own evidence in a letter writ- 
ten many years later, that his Abolitionism began in 
1840, which was the year of his engagement to Miss 
White." 

Those of us to-day who argue from woman's 
increased activity in national affairs an increase 
with it of that instinct by which women know 
right from wrong and good from evil, may take 
fresh courage from this example. 

The papers are printed from the original 
manuscripts, now in the possession of Mrs. 
Sydney Howard Gay. The first five were orig- 
inally published during 1844 in the " Penn- 
sylvania Freeman "; the rest, fifty in number, 
appeared from 1846 to 1850 in the "Na- 
tional Anti - Slavery Standard," of which 
periodical Lowell was for two years " titular 
associate editor." They are now issued in two 
octavo volumes, bound in dark gray cartridge 
paper boards, with printed labels. The typo- 
graphy is simple and dignified, yet uncommonly

attractive; and paper and presswork are of the 
best. There will be a rather general disagree- 
ment, we fancy, with the anonymous editor's 
conclusion that these writings '• can hardly 
heighten Lowell's literary reputation." But 
however this may be, assuredly they cannot 
fail to enhance his reputation as a lover of his 
kind. What this signifies Lowell has himself 
set down in no conciliatory language in his 
estimate of Daniel Webster, when he says : 

" What has Freedom to thank Daniel Webster for? 
What has Peace? What has Civilization? What has 
that true ConserTatism, which consists in bringing the 
earth forward and upward to the idea of its benign 
Maker? In one word, how is God the better served, 
how are heaven and earth more at one for his having 
bestowed upon this man that large ntteranee, that 
divine faculty of eloquent speech? How was man made 
in the image of God, save that the capacity was given 
him of being an adequate representative on earth of 
some one of the attributes of the Great Father, and 
His loyal ambassador to man? " 

In the literary sense it is interesting to trace 
in these papers the germs of thought which went 
into Lowell's great poems of freedom and de- 
mocracy, culminating in the " Commemoration 
Ode." Upon these writings in prose it is known 
that Lowell set comparatively small estimate ; 
yet it is certain that here he was sowing the 
seed of which the poems were only the harvest. 
Here, inspired by the love of woman broad- 
ened out into love of that mankind of which 
she has always been its fairest exemplar, were 
the beginnings of the close adhesion to prin- 
ciple before party which made his later in- 
ternational services to the English-speaking 
peoples possible. From this source, too, as the 
editor notes, came the harvest of the " Bigelow 
Papers." and the humor and fun of those had 
its origins in the wit and sarcasm of these. It 
is curious proof of the growing conformity of 
the American nation that the language of 
Lowell here is the language of the most radical 
of the opponents of the imperialistic system 
that is growing upon us, — and this in the face 
of the editor's perfectly accurate comment that 
Lowell "was, in fact, surprisingly free from 
radicalism." At the very outset of his subject, 
in the first of the papers, bearing the non- 
committal title " A Word in Season," there is 
a just estimate of the attitude of the conform- 
ing world toward the radical. Lowell writes : 

" A good t*st for deciding the soundness of any 
moral stand which a man has taken is the amount of 
opposition it excites. Pure truth is poison to the mere 
natural man, as he is strangely called, — that is, to man 
in the unnatural state to which ages of subservience to 
policy and compromise with wrong have reduced him. 
With this superinduced and adulterated nature, truth 



has no sympathy, and cannot assimilate. Society as 
then constituted sees that either it or they must perish. 
If the reformers are madmen or fanatics, Society will 
be the last to call them by either of these names. 
They are its choicest weapons against sane reformers, 
and their edge would be blunted by using them too in- 
discriminately. A madman will prove himself to be 
such without any extraneous help ; but when the re- 
former has taken his position in the commanding citadel 
of some indestructible truth, then the old battering- 
rams must be brought out again, the old swords sharp- 
ened and furbished up, and the startled spirit of the 
world can find room in its dainty mouth for obloqay 
and denunciation." 

It is small wonder that the reformer of to- 
day can find inspiration in these words of a 
reformer of the past. The theme of the col- 
lection is something greatly broader and deeper 
than the mere abolition of chattel slavery in 
the southern United States. " The aim of the 
true Abolitionist," Lowell writes in the first of 
his contributions, '' is not only to put an end to 
Negro slavery in America : he is equally the 
sworn foe of tyranny tbronghont the world." 
There is no delusion in Lowell's mind about 
this question of tyranny ; and the cant of 
Anglo-Saxonry, already rife in his early days, 
seems to him to cloak a tyranny rather worse, 
if anything, that the ordinary sort. He says : 
"The Norman barons (a race of savages, strong 
ehiefly in their intense and selfish acquisitiveness, to 
whom our Southern brethren are fond of comparing 
themselves) looked upon their Saxon serfs as mere cat- 
tle, and indeed reduced them as nearly as might be to 
that degraded level by their cruelty. Yet these very 
serfs were part and parcel of that famous Anglo- 
Saxon race, concerning whom we have seen so much 
claptrap in the newspapers for a few years past, espe- 
cially since the project of extending the area of free- 
dom has been discussed and glorified." 

Did space permit, it could be shown that 
the Declaration of Independence stood with 
Lowell for a declaration of principles — not an 
iridescent dream clad in glittering generalities. 
" Destiny '" he regarded as a specious syn- 
onym for expediency, and he hated expediency. 
Washington's warning against Europeanizing 
influences was still to him a real warning. He 
had no delusions respecting the character of 
American republicanism or democracy, and he 
writes with scorn of " a large class of persons 
who seem to consider that the tendency of 
all republics is toward anarchy." When the 
Church allies herself with the conservatism 
that wishes to keep things as they are, rather 
than cooperate with those who seek to have 
the world as it ought to be. no respect for 
" established institutions " keeps him silent. 
The evils that must come when America has 
DO more free land were within his vision, as

they were in Macaulay's. In brief, he knew, 
and his anti-slavery writings constantly prove 
that he knew, that without that eternal vig- 
ilance which is always liberty's price, for these 
United States also was reserved the fate of

MORMONISM AND ITS FOUXDER.* 

Without doubt, Abu Sufian marvelled how 
the crude practices and absurd pretensions of 
Mohammed could impose upon such an intelli- 
gent age as that in which he lived. So must 
the success of every movement that builds upon 
the superstition and the credulity of men cause 
the more rational members of the race to won- 
der and grow impatient. But that such move- 
ments did succeed in the nineteenth century, 
and are still succeeding in the electric-lighted 
dawn of the twentieth, is not of itself ground 
for discouragement. The fact shows only that 
there are still great numbers in even the most 
enlightened nations who are themselves far from 
sharing in the general illumination of their 
land and age. The gauge of advancing civil- 
ization is not the entire suppression of such 
movements, but their gradual restriction. 

In the face of Dowie's New Jerusalem and 
other less patent delusions of the past decade, 
the success of the prophecy of Joseph Smith, 
Jr., is not incomprehensible. There are other 
elements involved besides the inherent gulli- 
bility and ignorance of the masses. Mr. Linn 
is unfortunate in opening his valuable book 
upon the Mormons with a chapter of very 
doubtful validity on the persistence of super- 
stition. Indeed, he quotes with evident approval 
a declaration that the people of the United 
States and Great Britain are preeminently 
inclined to be " led to follow after crazy seers 
and seeresses." It does not seem to have oc- 
curred to him that the Mormon propaganda, 
being in the hands of uneducated missionaries 
largely, has been mainly confined to English- 
speaking countries, nor that any comparison of

the relative success of the propaganda should 
be based on the number of missionaries and 
the population of the countries visited. It is 
sufficient for explanation of the success of 
Mormonism to admit that there are in both 
Anglo-Saxon countries great numbers suscep- 
tible to the appeals of the grossest superstition* 
and of the most irrational cupidity. 

It is certainly difficult for any American to- 
treat the history of Mormonism without pas- 
sion, and Mr. Linn cannot lay claim to having 
done so. If Mormonism were merely a systena 
of beliefs, even though grossly superstitious, it 
ought to be possible for an enlightened citizen 
to depict it impartially. But involving, as it 
confessedly does, opposition to our government 
and violation of our standards of social moral- 
ity, it seems almost necessary to depatriate 
oneself in order to treat the subject dispassion- 
ately. So, while Mr. Linn must be convicted 
of manifesting prejudice against the institution 
he describes, it is hard to blame him for it, es- 
pecially since it appears that he gives a full 
hearing to both sides and bases his account in 
large measure upon esoteric Mormon sources. 
Mormonism is a system of religious and of 
socialistic beliefs and practices. It must be 
studied not only from the standpoint of com- 
parative religion, but also from that of soci- 
ology, and, as Mr. Kiley thinks, from the 
standpoint of psychology as well. Mr. Linn 
has undertaken to give such an outward chron- 
icle and account of the origin and growth of 
the institution. His sources are chiefly the 
Mormon journals, the diaries and biographies 
of their leaders, their religious books, and the 
accounts of various inside authorities, supple- 
mented by the accounts of certain seceders and 
of United States documents. His reference to 
his sources is constant and entirely adequate. 
No vital statement regarding belief or deed 
lacks confirmatory citations, mostly from Mor- 
mon sources. Mr. Linn has not gone so far in this 
respect as Mr. H. H. Bancroft, who permitted 
Mormon leaders to dictate bis account in the 
main, giving qualifications almost wholly in 
foot-notes. And of course Mr. Bancroft, who 
was writing a history of Utah, does not devote 
so much space to the beginnings of the sect as 
does Mr. Linn. His " Story of the Mormons " 
ought to be a definitive history of the sect down 
to the time of the migration to Utah, at least 
for non-Mormon readers. There is not much 
in it that is new, but it takes a middle path 
between those unfortunate accounts that have 
appealed to the prurient public taste for " un-

veiling " the grosser mysteries of polygamy, 
and the official Mormon histories with their 
intolerable pretense of sanctimony and injured 
innocence. The author is strongly convinced 
of the foundation of the Book of Mormon upon 
Spaulding's " The Manuscript Found," and of 
the share of Sidney Rigdon in purveying this 
manuscript to Smith. He furnishes some evi- 
dence confirmatory of the position of Howe on 
this subject, but nothing conclusive. 

Perhaps the most effective portions of Mr. 
Linn's work are those in which he shows the 
dishonesty and inconsistency of Smith's career 
and pretensions by quotations from -the pro- 
phet's own utterances. Mr. Bancroft's account 
of the beginnings of Mormonism, for instance, 
does not betray the fact that the original Mor- 
mon Bible declares explicitly against polygamy, 
and that the " revelation " favoring this insti- 
tution was an afterthought to support Smith's 
own conduct and that of some of his compan- 
ions. Thus also Mr. Linn points out the em- 
barrassing position in which the Mormon church 
and society are placed by the " revelations " 
direct from God, proclaiming the uprightness 
and trustworthiness of various members of the 
church who afterwards fell away and exposed 
the evil and corruptions of the body they had 
left. 

Mr. Linn is too much concerned with the 
attempt to explain the " miracle " of Mormon 
success on the basis of human gullibility and 
superstition. He fails to give sufficient weight 
to the socialistic and communistic fascinations 
of the Mormon plans. Neither does he take 
fairly into consideration the immense advan- 
tage the Mormons gained by keeping on the 
advancing border of settlement and civiliza- 
tion. By so doing they appealed to the rest- 
less, the dissatisfied, and the adventurous, 
while at the same time they profitted by the 
generosity of the government in the bestowal 
of the public domain. And finally, Mr. Linn 
forgets that seventy years are but a moment in 
the history of institutions and societies and re- 
ligions. He does, however, not* that Mor- 
monism cannot stand still and persist; that it 
does not draw adherents from its immediate 
neighbors; and that the restriction of the public 
domain is likely to reduce greatly — has, indeed, 
already reduced — the additions from foreign 
countries. These are considerations which may 
warrant the expectation of a different develop- 
ment for Mormonism by the time it completes 
its first century. 

Although one may question, in the case of 



another author, the value of a list of five hun- 
dred titles, paraded as "authorities consulted," 
the absence of a well-digested brief bibliog- 
raphy is a serious defect in Mr. Linn's book. 

Mr. Riley's psychological study of " The 
Founder of Mormonism " transfers the prob- 
lem from the field of comparative sociology 
and religion to that of pathology. The point 
of view makes it easier to be dispassionate, 
although to the devout Mormon the very point of 
view itself must seem hostile. Mr. Riley shows, 
and without difficulty, that Joseph Smith, Jr., 
was pronouncedly neurotic. His ancestrygives a 
forecast of what bis life developed. In youth he 
suffered from epileptic attacks, the type being 
diagnosed with much acuteness by Mr. Riley as 
" transitional." With maturity, the epileptic 
seizures disappeared ; but ego-mania and sen- 
sualism manifested themselves until, in the 
latter part of his life, " psychic coordination 
had disappeared, and heredity had passed down 
those abnormal tendencies that mark the de- 
generate." Only in a supplement does the 
author take up the question of Smith's mes- 
meric or hypnotic power and practice. How- 
ever, the evidence of his having exercised this 
sort of control over individuals and audiences 
is conclusive. 

It is indeed difficult for anyone to approach 
the subject of Mormonism without discussing 
the problem of the sources of the Book of 
Mormon. This is very far from the scope of 
Mr. Riley's inquiry, yet he goes aside from his 
main purpose to examine the subject fully in 
Chapters IV. and V., — "The Sources" and 
" The Author's Mentality." While it is shown 
that Smith's environment was just such as was 
needed for the production of religious delu- 
sions, there is an entire failure to explain the 
issuance of the language of the Book of Mor- 
mon from such an illiterate mouth as that of 
Joseph Smith, Jr. As to direct evidence intro- 
ducing Rigdon as a connecting link between 
Spaulding's "Manuscript Found " and Smith's 
translation of the Golden Plates, Mr. Riley is 
quite right in calling it " a drawn battle " be- 
tween the Mormons and the anti-Mormons. 
But his conclusion against such a connection 
is based upon three propositions, all of which 
are weak or more than weak. " There is no sim- 
ilarity between the Honolulu MS. of Spauld- 
ing's Indian migration story and the Mormon 
Bible." This no one claims, since the Hono- 
lulu MS. is plainly not the " Manuscript 
Found," which, it is claimed, served as the 
basis for the Mormon Bible. " The style of 



18 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



the Book of Mormon is just what might be 
expected of Smith, and tallies with his other 
synchronous writings." There is not sufficient 
evidence that Smith produced independently 
any of the writings attributed to him, but on 
the contrary it is probable that Rigdon wrote 
or edited most of Smith's "revelations" and 
other writings. "The style of the Book of 
Mormon is not that of Rigdon, and Rigdon 
would not have lent himself to a fraud." The 
style is in any case an assumed style, and 
Rigdon was scholar enough to assume it, while 
Smith was not. Moreover, Rigdon was Smith's 
willing tool, held, perhaps, by hypnotic control. 
Mr. Riley's work contains an excellent bib- 
liography, and is interesting both for its in- 
dependent spirit and for its attempt to apply 
psychology in a scientific manner to the inter- 
pretation of historical and anthropological 
problems. -^^ H. Cabbuth. 



Recent Poetry.* 



A slender volume of verse was put forth several 
years ago by Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson, and 
the few into whose hands it catne, if they had any 
skill in literary discernment, felt that the voice that 
addressed them was at least distinctively individual, 
and took pleasure in an utterance that seemed to 
scorn rhetorical trickery, and came arrayed in the 
strength of sincerity and truth. The numbers were 
bare almost to harshness, and they made little ap- 
peal to the fancy or the imaginative sense, but they 
had qualities of earnestness and vitality that arrested 
the attention and impressed the memory. Now, 
after a long period of silence, Mr. Robinson has 
given us " Captain Craig : A Book of Poems," and 
the impression made by the earlier collection is 
intensified. He has a philosophy of life, not clearly 
formulated in all respects, but traceable in its main

outlines, and clearly held with the deepest convic- 
tion. It is a philosophy for which we should say 
that Walt Whitman was in large measure respons- 
ible, and in which Browning would seem also to 
have had a hand, supplying the dramatic quality 
and the element of sardonic humor of which the 
" Leaves of Grass " is quite guiltless. It is the 
philosophy of the free spirit that has given no host- 
ages to the conventional life, and that seeks to divest 
from their adventitious trappings the fundamental 
verities of existence. If we can do this, and look 
the world squarely in the face, and realize that the 
subjective factor must play its part in the game, we 
shall find that it is a good world after all. But if 
we assume a supine or a merely receptive attitude, 
and trust to luck, we shall be the failures that we 
deserve to be. 

" There is no lack. 
No fate, no fortune for us, but the old 
Unanswering and inviolable price 
Gets paid : God sells himself eternally, 
But never gives a crust." 

The long narrative poem, "Captain Craig," serves 
as the chief vehicle of Mr. Robinson's theory of 
life. Captain Craig is to outward seeming a dis- 
reputable enough person, but we, who make his 
acquaintance through the good offices of the poet, 
are permitted to know him in his true character, 
which may be roughly described as combining some 
of the traits of Socrates, Aristophanes, and Carlyle. 
In other words, he displays shrewdness in getting 
at the heart of life's problems, irony in his treat- 
ment of them, and zeal in his warfare upon their 
adjuncts of insincerity or hypocrisy. The substance 
of the poem's teaching may be found in two repre- 
sentative extracts. 

" Courage is not enough to make men glad 
For laughter when that laughter is itself 
The tribute of recriminating groans ; 
Nor are the shapes of obsolescent creeds 
Much longer to flit near enough to make 
Men glad for living in a world like this ; 
But wisdom, courage, knowledge, and the faith 
Which has the soul and is the soul of reason — 
These are the world's achievers. And the child — 
The child that is the saviour of all ages,

This is fine, and even finer is the following passage 
from Captain Craig's last will and testament, in 
which docament he beqaeaths " God's aniverse " to 
his friends :

What all of yon are noting on all days 
la theae Athenian streets, where squandered men 
One rains "f half- warriors to the grare — 
Or to Hippocrates." 

We have no space in which to discuss the remaining 
poems in Mr. Robinson's volume. They are often 
impressive in their direct appeal to the fandamental 
emotions, bat none of them eqaals the titular poem 
in interest 

*' Apollo and Keats on Browning," by Mr. Clif- 
ford Lanier, is a fantasy more noticeable for art 
than for poetic qaality. The verses are too ragged 
to pass master with even the least censorioas of 
critics. There is far more pleasure to be derived 
from some of Mr. Lanier's less pretentions pieces. 
There are, for example, the pretty lines that dose 
his ode to the mocking-bird, •' The American Phil- 
omel." 

** Aa slsbister box of music's nard 
Upoa the feet of Ixitc thon sharterest : 
These drops of dew are fngrant with its sweet.

Oat of grim shadow benedictions come ; 

Mooalight like Christ's for^Teneas beams ; 
"Ay haavealy throatings whisper to the soul 

Uadyiag faith, sapataal, —

Mr. Lanier is also happy in his handling of some of 
the briefer forms of verse, as this qnatrain on Poe 
will indicate. 

" Dreaming along the haaated shore of time 
And mad that sea's .SoKaa song to sing. 
He fonnd the shell of beauty, rhythmic rhyme. 
And fondly deemed its sheen a liring thing." 



The '* Poems" of Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson 
inelade the contents of two previous volumes, to- 
gether with a new collection entitled "Italian Rhap- 
sody, and Other Poenos." This -'Italian Rhapsody" 
is the finest of the new pieces, and may be illustrated 
by the following group of stanzas : 

" Name me a poet who has trod thy soil ; 
He is thy loTer. ever hastening back. 
With thee forgetting weariness aad toil. 
The nightly sorrow for the daily lack. 
How oft oar lyric race 
Lsakad last upon thy faea !

This last touch tells us what Mr. Johnson thinks of 
the needless warfare that has blackened the history 
of the last few years. He has a very definite notion 
of the real nature of " the white man'8J.bnrdeD," a« 
the following lines attest : 

" What is the White Haa'a baidea—

That aaee waa ' Peaee aad Jaitiee ;

» The Death of Sir Launcelot, and Other Poems," 
by Mr. Cond^ Benoist Pallen, is a much more satis- 
factory volume than the one which we reviewed a 
year or so ago. There are passages of really fine 
inspiration and glowing beauty, yet in a broad senae 
the work is imitative — of Tennyson and others. 
These are the opening lines of the opening poem : 

" At Canterbary seven yean s monk 
Sir Launcelot had abode. For Arthur passed. 
And all the goodly fellowship of knights 
Broken and scattered through his mighty sin 
With Goinevere. be songht to porge his guilt 
By prayers and fasting and the biting scourge 
Withia the holy life, till chastened love. 
Freed from the clogging dross of earthly | 
Leap a shooting flame upward to Heaven."

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



The last of these lines illustrates Mr. Fallen's chief 
fault. He either has an incurably defective ear, or 
is inexcusably careless. It would have been so easy 
to write 

" Leap like a shooting flame upward to Heaven." 
We should set this down for a mere slip in proof- 
reading, were it not that similarly defective lines 
are of frequent occurrence. The opening poem is 
followed by a series of quatrains " To Omar Khay- 
yam," of which one example may be given. 

" Knowledge may reach from shining star to star, 
Enthroned on three-winged Satnrn sit afar, 
And still as distant he from Wisdom's house 
As when it beat against this lower bar." 

The burden of this poem is the emptiness of skep- 
ticism to him who views life from the calm haven 
of the Catholic faith. The following fine sonnet 
pictures the shame that has come to us as a nation 
in our dealings with Spain and its possessions : 

" We gave a solemn pledge, and called on Heaven 

To hear ; our arms, we swore, were Freedom's own. 
Our valour sprung from her chaste bosom, given 

To Freedom consecrate, and her alone; 
To Freedom's cause for ever, and her levin 

We forged upon the footsteps of her throne ; 

Her sword unclasping from her zone, 
She placed within her hands, and blessed us shriven. 

" O solemn mockery of her holy trust ! 

Our troth forgot and slaked our noble zeal, 

Onr brittle honour shattered in the dust ! 

A riotous people drunk with Conquest's lust. 
In bacchanalian rout we onward reel, 
And 'gainst her turn her own ensanguined steel." 

The poets, at least, remain true when others fail us, 
and the future historian will turn to them, rather 
than to the time-serving political writers of the 
hour, for the just estimate of the present dark 
period in our national annals. 

Mr. John McGovern is an old-time journalist of 
Chicago who has essayed various forms of literary 
composition, and is the author of at least one strik- 
ing piece of fiction. The " Poems " which he has 
just collected into a little book are evidently the 
product of occasional impulse rather than of set 
poetic purpose, and include the work of upwards 
of a score of years. Short pieces in blank verse 
make up the greater part of the collection. We 
select the very last thing in the volume, this descrip- 
of sunshine after storm: 

" The storm recedes, the snn shines out, the clouds. 
Like fallen fortresses, their portals ope 
Before the flight of earthward-hurrying beams — 
And lo I the couriers with their victory I 
The music of the herd comes o'er the mead 
In homely cow-bell tones, as rude to-day 
As in Pan's time. The clover-synod kneels — 
Each tiny bishop's mitre lit with gems — 
And silken rustles fill the aisles of corn, 
As though the wives of modern Pharisees 
Passed to their public prayer. Behind a gorge 
Of ether icebergs, Hope, at azure loom, 
In warp of san-rays with a woof of rain, 
Arches her rainbow web upon the black 
That curtains all the east, where crowds the storm." 

This is finely imagined, and does not suffer from 
what is the chief fault of Mr. McGorem's writing — 



the tendency to strain after effects and to indulge 
in over-ornamented language. 

It is rather for the excellence of their intentions 
than for any poetic merit they possess that we 
quote the following lines on " Columbia " from Mr. 
Dayton Ervin's " The Hermitage and Random 
Verses." 

" Decked with rare jewels, wealth at her command, 

Her stately bearing stands them all in awe. 

How proudly flash her cold gray eyes, with hand 

Upon the helm of state, the queen of law ! 

The pride of self is written on her brow ; 

Those tell-tale life-marks on her handsome face 

Are where her broken promises made trace : 

This is Columbia as she is now. 

" In olden days a young fair maiden stood, 
The rich embodiment of strength and youth ; 
Her sunny face emitted rays of good 
For all, so strong her love for man and truth. 
At her no finger pointed with distrust, 
For young Columbia was not for lust." 

Mr. Ervin has not the gift of song, and there is 
hardly a trace of poetic art in his collection of verses. 
Those who are accustomed to survey our cur- 
rent activity in verse-making cannot fail to be im- 
pressed by the amount of work that comes from the 
Pacific Coast. Not much of this work is distin- 
guished by fine craftmanship, or has the arresting 
quality of enduring song, but most of it is the prod- 
uct of sincere endeavor, and the amount of the out- 
put speaks well for literary conditions in the far 
West. One of the best books that have recently 
reached us from this section is Mr. Christian Bink- 
ley's volume of " Sonnets and Songs for a House 
of Days." Mr. Binkley's songs are creditable, and 
his sonnets are more than creditable, as the follow- 
ing example will show : 

" Why linger, Love, within the vale below 
Amid the dews and lamps ? The view is wide. 
Upon the lofty Peak, and I shall guide 
To regions of delight none else may know. 

Green is the valley, pleasant in its flow 
The river with the rushes at its side. 
The meadows with their violets blue and pied 
And shadows that forever come and go. 

But fairer are the heights that we shall tread, 
Brighter the sunset splendors that uprear 
Their minarets of gold, the stars outspread 

Lordly at night. Then tremble not, nor fear 
O Love, to come : its beauty will be fled 
And all the joy be pain save thou be near." 

Mr. Binkley's pieces are arranged in a sequence 
suggestive of " an outline of life and a progressive 
criticism upon it." He further says: "I have let 
the poems fall into some sort of order in an ap- 
proximation to what seemed to me when they were 
written a just and central conception of a man's 
relation to his surroundings, — arranging as it were, 
a few details of the story of this wrestling match 
of ours in the dawn." 

Mr. Bailey Millard is another Californian poet, 
and his " Songs of the Press" recount in light vein 
the humors of the reportorial calling. This plaint 
of the unappreciated underling concerning the " star 
writer " will find an echo in the heart of many a 
budding journalist :

Bnt at that game he can give 'era cards and spades ; 
He will fall down on a story without any hesitation. 
And still keep on a-shiniog, for his glory never fades. 
Ob, the star, oh. the star. 
Oh, the empty-beaded star! 
He has nothing bnt bis halo, and that never, never fades." 

Mr. Millard is also a writer of serious verse, for 
these songs of the pressroom and the desk make ap 
only about a third of his volume. The remaining 
contents reveal him as a singer of parts, whether 
his inspiration be the life of the open air or that 
which comes from books. His tribute to " Mair 
of the Mountains" shall pay tribute to this notice. 

" A lean, wild-haired, wild-bearded craggy man, 
Wild as a Modoc and as unafraid, 
A man to go bis way with no man's aid. 
Yet sweet and soft of heart as any maid. 

"Sky-loving, stalwart as the sugar-pine. 
Clean, simple, fragrant as that noble tree, 
A mountain man, and free as they are free 
Who tread the heighu and know tranquillity." 

There is a ringing and virile quality about Mr. 
Millard's best verse that will produce a reaction 
in the most sluggish of readers. The cast of his 
thought is not pale, but ruddy with the glow of 
spiritual health. 

The spirit of old New England, with its land- 
scape, its legend, and its life of spiritual stress, 
breathes from the volume in which Mrs. Elizabeth 
Akers has collected the verse of many years. The 
author has now passed her seventieth birthday, and 
has for more than forty years been widely known by 
the lines called " Rock Me to Sleep," of which the 
authorized version is here printed, with a note de- 
scribing its singular fortunes. With this excep- 
tion, the contents of '»The Sunset Song and Other 
Verses " are matter which has been hitherto unpub- 
lished. Thus we have some three hundred pages 
of new song, tender and true as to sentiment, and 
rather unusual as to its mastery of many forms of 
verse. We take for our extract the piece entitled 
^' Cruel and Sweet." 

" ' Cruel and sweet, his hands reach down to hell ' — 
Thus sang the Celtic bard of Love's strong spell, 
" And his wild wailing words of passionate pain 
Were heard by lonely rocks and moaning main 

" Long, long ago, — yet still as true they be 
As when they saddened first the sighing sea. 

" His vows are as the fickle winds that pass ; 
His oaths are brittle as the frosted grass. 

" The gifts he brings are made of fairy gold 
Which turns to dead leaves ere the day is old. 

*' Who wears his flowery fetters, oft most bear 
Pain, sore denial, poverty, and care; 



" Most give np pleasure, peace, and selfish ease, 
For wearying tasks and thankless ministries. 

" Often he wrongs the fondest faith and tmst 
And brings the proudest forehead to the dnst. 

" He dooms to exile, or to prison cell ; 
' Cruel and sweet, his hands reach down to hell.' — 

" Yet, O sad singer, think awhile and tell — 
Keach they not also up to heaven as well ? " 

Another New England singer, beloved of a past 
generation, is Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford, who 
from her Deer Island home in the Merrimac still 
puts forth her books from year to year. The latest 
of her books is called '' The Great Procession," and 
is a collection of songs of childhood, exquisite in 
fancy and delightful in expression. Some stanzas 
from " The Land of Story Books " shall place this 
verdict beyond a doubt. 

" The moment she blows ont the light 
And all is dark and cool about. 
And through the window quickly peers 
A great star sparkling in and ont. 
By foaming brooks and mossy nooka, 
I find the land of Story Books. 

" Harry and Lucy go with me 
Rollo, and boys and girls a troop, 
Sindbad the Sailor follows ns 
When in Aladdin's Cave we stoop. 
And, sometimes then we, little men. 
See dear Hans Christian Andersen. 

" And sinking into downy elonds 
Strange seems the Pilgrim going by 
With Great Heart, strange seems Crusoe's face. 
And strange the Land of Nod should lie 
With hushing brooks and pillowed nooks 
So near the land of Story Books." 

This is as charming as Stevenson at his best, and 
stands in marked contrast to the artificial songs of 
childhood that fill so many of our modern books 
and magazines for the young. 

" A Reed by the River," which is the title of 
Miss Virginia Woodward Cloud's volume of poems, 
suggests plaintive or piercing melody, with a touch 
of inspiration from classical themes. The sugges- 
tions are not borne out by any particular piece 
among the contents, bnt are realized in the general 
tenor of the poet's song, which is noteworthy for its 
musical deliverance and its haunting sense of nat- 
ural beauty. The irregular sonnet called " Dusk " 
is an example of Miss Cloud's most melodious and 
felicitous diction. 

" Beyond the burning rhapsody of noon. 
The wind's einsive harp-note in the trees. 
Between the sunset and the primrose noon. 
There is a rapture all nnknown of these, — 
The harmony of twilight. Nature's note, 
Prolonged, pellucid, subtler far than song. 
Bearing the lifted soul till it doth float 
Upon the heart of night and find it strong ; 
Against this bar the tides of tumult fail 
And waves slip back into a silent deep ; 
The world, beneath a white and windless sail. 
Drifts outward to the vaster sea of sleep. 
And thought, starlike, doth rise above Time's shoal 
To find thee still — thou starlight of my sonl ! "

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



We should like to quote, for the sake of contrast, 
and to illustrate a very different manner of the 
author, " The Ballad of Sweet P," which tells how 
Miss Penelope Penwick on the Christmas eve of 
1776, beguiled the British officers at Trenton into 
forgetfulness of their duties until fate came upon 
them from across the Delaware. It is a capital 
poem, spirited and dramatic, which should prove an 
effective addition to the repertoire of the reciter. 

We have not had a volume from Miss Edith 
Thomas for some years, and it is a pleasure to re- 
new acquaintance with so sincere and thoughtful a 
singer. " The Dancers and Other Legends and 
Lyrics " is a collection of pieces that have much of 
the old charm, although the note seems at times a 
little worn. We care less for the group of legend- 
ary narratives with which the volume opens than 
for the nature-lyrics and reflective pieces that fol- 
low. The two quatrains of " Mirage " have par- 
ticularly attracted our attention. 

" Treasure the shadow. Somewhere, firmly-based, 
Arise those turrets that in cloud-laod sliine ; 
Somewhere, to thirsty toilers of the waste ; 
Yon phantom well-spring is a living sign. 

" Treasure the shadow. Somewhere, past thy sight, 
Past all men's sight, waits the true heaven at last : 
Tell them whose fear would put thy hope to flight. 
There are no shadows save from substance cast." 

A typical illustration of the clear-cut expression 
which we expect from Miss Thomas is furnished 
by the poem called " Caprice of the Muses." 

"Of old the Muses sat on high. 

And heard and judged the songs of men ; 
On one they smiled, who loitered by. 
Of toiling ten, they slighted ten, 

" ' They lightly serve who serve us best. 

Nor know they how the task was done ; 
We Muses love a soul at rest. 
But violence and toil we shun.' 

"If men say true, the Muses now 

Have changed their ancient habitude. 

And would be served with knitted brow. 

And stress and toil each day renewed, 

" So each one with the other vies, 

Of those who weave romance or song ; 
' On us, O Mase, bestow the prize. 
For we have striven well and long ! ' 

" And yet methinks I hear the best 

Come murmuring down from Helicon : 

' They lightly serve who serve us best. 

Nor know they how the task was done I ' " 

The noble poem called " Palingenesis " portrays the 
growth of the soul of man, through all the stages of 
evolution, to the full self-consciousness of its divine 
origin. 

" Wild is the life of the wave, and free is the life of the air. 

And sweet is the life of the measureless pastures, unbur- 
dened of care ; 

They have all been mine, I upgather them all in the being 
of man. 

Who knoweth, at last, that the God hath dwelt in him since 
all life began ! 

My heritage draw I from these — I love though I leave 
them behind ; 



But shall I not speak for the dumb, and lift up my sight for 

the blind ? 
I am kin to the least that inhabits the air, the waters, the 

clod. 
They wist not what bond is between us, who know not the 

Indwelling God ! 
For under my hands alone the charactered Past hath he laid. 
One moment to scan ere it fall like a scroll into ashes and 

fade! 
Enough have I read to know and declare — my ways he will 

keep. 
If onward I go, or again in a fold of his garrapnt I sleep ! " 

This is suggestive of some of the later poems of 
Tennyson, and has, if possible, a higher spiritual 
reach and a deeper message. 

It is many years since we have had a volume of 
verse bearing the name of Mrs. Hamilton-King, but 
the author of " The Disciples " is in no danger of 
being forgotten. We cannot say that " The Hours 
of the Passion and Other Poems " is as precious a 
possession as the volume that enshrines the soul of 
Mazzini and the devotion of his followers, but we 
can say that it deseives a hi^h place among the 
poetry of refined religious emotion. " The Garden 
of the Holy Souls " is a typical example of Mrs. 
King's work, and is fortunately not too long for 
quotation in full. 

" In Thy garden, in Thy garden, though the rain 
Fall, and the winds beat there. 
And they stand unsheltered, piteous, in the storm. 
They who were once so fair. 
" In Thy garden of the souls, where Thou art gardener, 
Thou Who wast once so mild, 
Now pruning down to naked stems and leafless 
The roses that ran wild. 
" Oh, Thy roses once waved in the wind so sweetly. 
Though thick with thorns beset ; 
In the morning sunshine opening, and at evening 
With cool dews wet. 
" In Thy garden, where Thou walkest as a warder. 
How poor, how small they stand ; 
Yet once their beauty, to the hearts that loved them. 
Lighted the living land. 

" In Thy garden, where no smile of Thine is granted, 
Yet keep within Thy heart, 
A place in Paradise for these transplanted. 
Still with Thee where Thou art. 
" In Thy garden, in Thy garden, where Thy roses 
Without a thorn are sweet. 
And each poor branch in endless wreaths uncloses 
To kiss Thy feet ! " 

The note of tender and exalted mysticism which is 
struck by the best of these poems is not unlike that 
which inspires the religious verse of Christina 
Rossetti, and no higher praise than this could well 
be given. 

Mrs. Shorter's new ballads, particularly " The 
Woman Who Went to Hell " and " Earl Roderick's 
Bride," are striking compositions, and have much of 
the true flavor of the old-time form which they seek 
to imitate. The legends are particularly fitted for 
this treatment, and the impression is clean-cut and 
deep. It is useless to attempt to quote from them, 
but the thin volume yields two lyrics sufficiently 
brief for that purpose, and of the two we have 
chosen "The Watcher in the Wood." 



1903.]

" Deep in the wood's rM;«s8^s cool 
I lee the {airr djuicerg glide, 
In eloth of ^old, in gown of green, 
Hy lord and Udy side by side. 

" Bat who has hnng from leaf to leaf — 
From flower to flower a silken twine, 
A cload of grey that holds the dew 
In globes of clear enchanted wine ? 

" Or stretches far from branch to branch. 
From thorn to thorn, in diamond rain. 
Who caught the cup of crystal pare 
And hung so far the shining chain ? 

" 'Tis death, the spider, in his net, 
AVho lures the dancers as they glide. 
In cloth of gold, in gown of green, 
Hy lord and lady side by side." 

A word of praise must be given to the fine frontis- 
piece, illustrative of the titular ballad, with which 
the book is adorned. 

Lady Lindsay's new volume, " A Christmas 
Posy," ie chiefly made np of carols and songs in 
the conventional manner and with the asaal artifieal 
accessories of shepherds and flocks and angeb. 
The songs are informed by sincere feeling, and are 
prettily expressed. 

" By Nazareth's green hills and dales. 
There where the wild red lilies blow, 
Down to the shore among dusky vales. 
The young child Jesus once did go. 

I Then tet. then see. 
On lattice and Udqe out garlands be 
The ivy friuA and tie holly tree.)" 

A particularly charming feature of the volume is 
afforded by a selection of old French Noels (with a 
few German examples also), given us in both text 
and translation. What seems to us the loveliest of 
Lady Lindsay's lyrics is that called >■ At Eventide " 
— too long to quote, and too much an organic unity 
to represent by an excerpt. 

A little more than a year ago we found it pleasant 
to read and to gay a good word for an anonymous 
little book of verse called ■■ Heartsease." A second 
▼olame is now at hand from the same author, who 
now reveals her identity as Miss Lilian Street. It 
is a volume of pretty sentimental trifles, of which 
" An Evening Ride " is a good example. 

'* The day's late light on the downland 
Lingers, and gleams, and glows ; 
The cloud-drifts harrying seaward* 
Magical dreams discloee. 

" The North wind full in our faces 
Cuts like the chill of pain — 
Yet, say. shall the day's best beauty 
Speak to you all in vain ? 

" Hy heart to yoar heart would whisper 
Some hope, if that might be — 
But I pray that you hold my silence 
The better sympathy." 

Evening seems to prove the best inspiration of this 
writer, for it inspires not only the charming lyric 
just quoted, but also this equally charming sonnet: 

" Acroas the fields of lavender they stole, 
The sweetest bells that ever called to prayer. 
Or charmed the peevish ear, or filled the soni 
With short forgetfulness of narrow care. 
Tbey marked the hoar when purple shadows creep ; 



And homing birds fly low with nesting song ; 
When sunset cloads athwart the heavens sweep 
In folds of amber light, the summer long. 
Sweet bells, that I shall never hear again ! 
They ring for me a memory too dear. 
Of sunset hoars that held for me no pain. 
Of love-voiced birds it then was joy to hear: 
Hence 'neath the amber skies afar. I sigh 
For fragrant fields and childhood's melody." 

It has always seemed to us that Mr. Alfred 
Austin has been unfairly dealt with by the critics. 
They have never forgiven him for the crime of being 
made Laureate at a time when greater poets were 
still living in England. Yet the appointment was 
on the whole fairly creditable and peculiarly dis- 
tinguished by a sense of fitness. An avowed repub- 
lican or a pronounced socialist — to mention the 
only two really great poets among his contempora- 
ries — could not well have been made the official 
poet of the English monarchy, and among the many 
possible candidates remaining, Mr. Austin's claim 
was as good as that of most of his fellows. He 
could not help it, poor man, if he was not the peer 
of Tennyson and Wordsworth ; he had been con- 
scientiously engaged in producing the best literature 
of which he was capable during a period of nearly 
half a century, and had to his credit, besides several 
prose volumes of unquestionable charm, a large 
body of verse that was always respectable and some- 
times distinguished. Since his occupancy of the 
laureateship, he has now and then rashly rushed 
into print, offering the public what was journalism 
rather than poetry, but he has sometimes risen to 
the occasion presented, and struck an unexception- 
able note. "Take, for example, the quatrain called 
" Winter Violets," the lines laid upon the bier of the 
late Queen at Osborne, and see if they are not both 
graceful and appropriate. 

" Here are tad flowers, with wintry weeping wet. 
Dews of the dark that drench the violet. 
Thus over her. whom death yet more eadeara. 
Nature and man together blend their tears." 

These verses are found at the close of Mr. Atistin's 
latest volume, " A Tale of True Love, and Other 
Poems,'' dedicated to the President of the United 
States, and introduced by a preface which recalls 
the author's long and steadfast friendship for our 
people. We have taken no little pleasure in the 
contents of this volume, a pleasure due chiefly to the 
two Italian poems, " Florence " and "In the Forum." 
We reproduce the final stanzas of the latter of these 
poems. 

" Here, even in the noontide glare. 

The gods, recumbent, take their eaae ; 
Go look, and yon will find them there. 
Slumbering behind some fallen frieze. 

" Bat most, when sunset glow hath paled. 
And come, as now. the twilight hoar. 
In Taqter vaeneaeM dimly veiled 

I feel their presence and their power. 

" What though their temples strew the groimd. 
And to the ruin owls repair. 
Their home, their haunt, is all around ; 
They drive the elood, they ride the air.

" And, when the planets wend their way 

Along the nerer-aging skies, 
' Revere the gods,' I hear them say ; 
' The gods are old, the gods are wise.' 

" Build as man may. Time gnaws and peers 
Through marble fissures, granite rents ; 
Only Imagination rears 
Imperishable monuments. 

" Let Goth and Gaul pollute the shrine, 
Level the altar, fire the fane : 
There is no razing the divine ; 
The gods return, the gods remain." 

The narrative poem which gives a title to the volume 
tells of a disappointed lover who goes to the war in 
South Africa. We quote one stanza. 

" But with the morrow's dawn there came the tidings 
How that a crafty, freedom-loathing race. 
Its schemes unmasked, had come from out its hidings, 
And flung defiance in its suzerain's face, 
Then on his open territories burst. 
Proclaiming these annexed unto its rule accursed." 

This is not remarkable as poetry, but it presents a 
political truth which the Boer partisans have done 
their best to obscure. It may well give pause to 
those who have traduced a nation that has fought at 
once for the defense of her territory and for the 
fundamental liberties that all men of English blood 
must ever hold dear under penalty of being false to 
their birthright. 

Mr. Richard Askham is a young Englishman who 
visited America a few years ago, making a considera- 
ble stay in California, and who now publishes a small 
volume of poems containing a number of reminis- 
cences of his stay in the West. The volume is called 
" Moods and Outdoor Verses," and is introduced to 
us by Mr. Edwin Markham in a prefatory note. It 
is a book characterized by both thought and imagina- 
tion, and it is pleasant to think that the inspiration 
of Mr. Askham's song is due in part to his sojourn 
upon this side of the Atlantic. The poem called 
" Reality " expresses a mood that is known in the 
experience of every reflective mind. 

" Rare is that blossom of sweet memory 
The dreamer's vision, out of days forgot 
Mystically remembered and reborn 
In eager, active fingered, arduous days. 
Yet never to be native there again. 

"Dream who may dream 1 Rarer the ringing act 
Chiming with act in perfect parallel 
And building up invincible success, 
Rounded as lies a poem on the pages 
And perfect as a song. Dream who would dream I 
But here's the marble of reality. 
And dreams may go. 

" But when the deed !s done. 
What is the thing accomplished ? Is 't a flower, 
A star, a passion, this accomplished thing? 
Something to ring forever and for aye. 
To burn and throb and blossom in God's hand 
Until the ages cease ? Or is it but 
Handfuls of barren ashes and vain dust? " 

Mr. Askham is a poet from whom we shall gladly 
hear again. 

Mr. Herman Montague Donner's '• English Lyrics 
of a Finnish Harp " include a number of transla- 



tions from Topelius and Runeberg (including the 
"Sveaborg"of Fanrik Staal), as well as the author's 
original verse. Mr. Donner has vigor, and imag- 
ination, and fine idealism, but the technique of En- 
glish versification is beyond his powers. A sonnet 
called " Amber " may be given for our example of 
his work. 

"Once flew a frail, ephemeral, bright thing 

Among the pines of Finland's ancient shore. 
'Mid trembling shadows did it glance and soar 

Till, near some trunk too near adventuring, 

Ensnai^d was its iridescent wing 

By oozing gum. Thus, stayed for evermore. 
The spread wings glowed ; and seons passed before 

A pick their amber shrine to light did bring. 

"B'en so sometimes from out the poet's dreams, 
'Mid hinted truths and half-seen similes, 

Some thought elusive through the shadows gleams. 
Then, seizing on it, his clear rhapsodies 

The bard pours round it, and, o'erjoyed, redeems 
A fragment of the world's lost solaces." 

It is a pretense easy of penetration that would 
have us think of Mr. Laurence Hope's collection of 
" India's Love Lyrics " as translations, or even 
paraphrases, of Eastern originals. The title-page 
admits that Mr. Hope has " collected and arranged " 
these poems ; it might as well have said outright 
that he is their author. They are Indian in theme, 
no doubt, and Indian in their warmth and color, as 
well as in their sentiment and imagery. Possibly a. 
few of them have as their actual basis some folk- 
song or lyrical legend of the Orient. We have 
selected '■ Mahomed Akram's Appeal to the Stars " 
for our illustrative quotation. 

" Oh, silver stars that shine on what I love. 

Touch the soft hair and sparkle in the eyes, — 
Send, from your calm serenity above, 
bleep to whom, sleepless, here, despairing lies. 

" Broken, forlorn, upon the Desert sand 

That sucks these tears, and utterly abased. 
Looking across the lonely, level land. 
With thoughts more desolate than any waste. 

" Planets that shine on what I so adore, 

Kow thrown, the hour is late, in careless rest. 
Protect that sleep, which I may watch no more,. 
I, the cast out, dismissed and dispossessed. 

"Far in the hillside camp, in slumber lies 

What my worn eyes worship but never see. 
Happier stars ! your myriad silver eyes 
Feast on the quiet face denied to me. 

"Loved with a love beyond all words or sense^ 
Liost with a grief beyond the saltest tear. 
So lovely, so removed, remote, and hence 
So doubly and so desperately dear I 

" Stars ! from your skies so purple and so calm, 
That through the centuries your secrets keepv 
Send to this worn-out brain some Occult Balm, 
Send me, for many nights so sleepless, sleep. 

" And ere the sunshine of the Desert jars 
My sense with sorrow, and another day, 
Through your soft Magic, oh, my Silver Stars I 
Turn sleep to Death in some mysterious way." 

This lovely poem is companioned by many others of 
equal loveliness, and the volume is indeed treasure- 
^^o\e. William Morton Payne.

Briefs on Xkw^ Books. 



When a man of an experiencing 
5*'"^'^^'* nature (to use Walter Bagehot's 

phrase) jields to the autobiographic 
inopnlse, his book is pretty sare to be interesting, 
and is often instractive. Citizen Greorge Francis 
Train's '* My Life in Many States and in Foreign 
Lands" (Appleton) is not disapfwinting in these 
respects. His career is packed fall of incident and 
adventure of the most diverting description ; and 
thoogh the lesson it teaches is not always the one 
he may have thought to convey, the reader cannot 
close the book without carrying away something to 
pay him for the time spent in its perusal. Despite 
the author's eccentricities, which the courts have 
dodared to amount to insanity, he has a winsome 
pononality, as the children that flock around him 
abundantly testify ; and his book, with all its glori- 
fication of the writer, is pleasantly suggestive of his 
personality. Omitting the more important features 
of his history, features comparatively well known 
to the world, we may note one or two minor indica- 
tions of character that please us. An enthusiastic 
admiration for Emerson is one of them. As a boy 
in Waltham, he first saw and heard the Concord 
lecturer. " I will come to lecture." wrote Emerson, 
" for $5 for myself, but ask you for four quarts of 
oats for my horse." The lecture was •• Nature." 
It was young Train who, in 1847, sold Emerson 
his ticket to Europe and escorted him to the vessel. 
There is a good deal of the philosopher about Mr. 
Train. Living now on three dollars a week at the 
Mills Hot«l on Bleecker street, which he chooses to 
e»ll the Mills Palace, he says, '• Here I am more 
contented than I was at Newport" — where the 
expenses of his villa amounted to $2000 a week. 
His propensity for getting into trouble with the 
powers that be is most amusing. Fifteen times, he 
tells us, he has been in jail, without a crime. A 
tendency to estimate men in terms of dollars and 
cents is not unnatural in this man of material 
achievement; yet he is not easily humbugged by 
mere display of wealth. The secret of his varioos 
successes in the world of commerce is probably 
found in his alertness, his Yankee ingenuity, his un- 
tiring energj-. his abounding self-confidence, and his 
never-failing optimism. The book of this railroad- 
builder was written with railroad speed — dictated 
in thirty-five hours. But its marks of haste are 
not many ; the worst is calling Wales an island. 

When a distinctively novel and fresh 
treatment of an important domain of 
human thought is brought forward, 
it is proper that the attention of students other than 
those specially appealed to by the subject in question 
should be directed toward the work that promises 
some newer insight, some unachieved vista of a 
fertile regfion. For such reason, the book of Mr. 
Gastav Spiller, which bears the title •' The Mind of 
Man " (Maemillan), deserves an index-finger of 



An oriyvud 



imptortanee and snggestiveness. Mr. Spiller has, 
unfortunately, seen fit to burden his exposition with 
an intelligible yet unfamiliar terminology, that may 
scare away many a possible reader, though doubtr 
less it ought not to do so. The dominant motive that 
determines the unfoldment of the chapters, as well 
as the terminology, is the recognition of needs m 
the determinants of the human impulses, thought*, 
and actions ; in other words, it is the study of men- 
tal functions that gives the starting-point and the 
method to the psychologist's search. The variations 
that are composed upon this central theme, and the 
diversity of problems to which its expansion leads, 
are broad enough to warrant the sub-title, ■■ A Text- 
book of Psychology." Mr. Spiller is a master in 
the art of introspection ; and for whatever topic 
that mode of analysis is well adapted to bring to 
light the recondite relations of mental operations, 
the book may be counted upon to contribute some- 
thing worthy, original, and interesting. It is in this 
respect that the pages frequently remind one of the 
spiciness (though the flavor is different) of the 
work of Professor James. Mr. Spiller takes little 
at second-hand ; indeed, his manner of disposing of 
the opinions of former psychologists, were it not 
obviously sincere, would suggest disrespect. Tet 
the literature of the topic is clearly utilised and 
rather better recapitulated than in any other single 
work. Whether he is considering the evolution of 
habits and impulses, or the scope of memory, or the 
roh of language, or the elaboration of the imagina- 
tion, or the conditions imposed by the nervous sys- 
tem, or the fluctuations of function in disturbed or 
distorted mental states, or the world of dreams, or 
the significance of originality, or the province of 
esthetics, or the paramount importance of attention 
in the distinctive thought-activities of man, the author 
carries with him the reader's interest by the vigor 
of his presentation, the suggestive pertinence of 
his illustrations, and the clearness of his purpose. 
As these characteristics are by no means sufficiently- 
distinctive of any group of writers — psychologists 
included — to be regarded as commonplace, the vol- 
ume may be emphatically recommended as one that 
is likely to bring many things to many men. '

shadowy "I" who is thq narrator. The places 
they visit are so vaguely featured as to defy iden- 
tification ; for '< just as a rose by any other name 
would smell as sweet, so a slowly mouldering ruin, 
a village ' the world forgetting, by the world forgot,' 
a humble pious parsonage, a semi-feudal castle, do 
not lose their charm or their dignity because the 
material imagination calls them by a wrong appel- 
lation." The conversations of the four travellers

range from Shelley to the Papacy, but are too ami- 
able, not to say artificial, to stir the reader's feel- 
ing. But that on Gladstone, by way of exception, 
i8 pointed enough to be somewhat irritating to the 
general reader. The poetry which caps several of 
the conversations — and the cheerful reader smiles 
in spite of himself at the amount of lugging it takes 
to get some of it in — is not different from Mr. Aus- 
tin's other verse. " If Time Would Halt " shows his 
pensive-pious strain at nearly or quite its best, while 
" Willowweed and Meadowsweet " has genuine lyric 
flow and delicacy. Altogether the story moves in a 
tenuous, sublunary atmosphere. The people are not 
real, and cannot do or say real things. Their ex- 
cursion is said to be a drive, and there is one refer- 
ence to "conveyances" and "animals." But for 
any of the particularities of driving that are re- 
corded, these literary pilgrims might have used their 
wings. Indeed, the reader would scarcely object if 
they had. The power of the book lies in the very 
atmosphere of unreality which it creates. The 
reader who accepts it at all must leave the " ephem- 
eral fret, fume, and turmoil of to-day," and enter a 
region where reigns a hazily poetic peace, — not, 
perhaps, the England which Mr. Austin describes 
for him with a tender dimness, but at least a region 
which his own mind will create for him if he will 
once submit to the author's unstrenuous leading. 

A privately-printed volume of " Mis- 
cellanies," hy Mr. Henry Strong, 
brings together the occasional ad- 
dresses, papers, and other literary diversions of 
a man who has thought deeply upon many sub- 
jects, and who, without being a professional writer, 
has for nearly half a century brought a well- 
equipped intellect to bear upon many of the most 
serious human concerns. Mr. Strong has the pro- 
fessional training of the lawyer, although he has 
not practiced his profession for many years. Con- 
tact with large affairs and intercourse with many 
of the most distinguished men of his time have 
ripened his judgment and given weight to his 
ideas. The contents of this volume range all the 
way from his casual remarks upon the opening of 
the cable system of street railways in Chicago to his 
Supreme Court argument (1867) " Ex-Relatione 
Riggs vs. Johnston County " — a leading case of a 
generation ago. Several of the papers were pre- 
pared for the Chicago Literary Club, the Chicago 
Ethical Society, and the various legal associations 
which he has been invited to address. A number 
of them are personal tributes, among which are 
noteworthy the memorial addresses upon Justice 
Miller of the U. S. Supreme bench and Governor 
J. Sterling Morton, both of whom were intimate 
friends of the writer from his earliest years. The 
papers that are occupied with ethical and religious 
themes are liberal in their outlook and broad- 
minded in their conclusions. The open letter on 
the Philippine question is perhaps the most valu- 
able single number of the collection, and ranges

the writer with the convinced exponents of that 
fine older type of Americanism which our recent 
imperialistic debauch has brought into temporary 
disrepute. 

There is no more interesting chapter 
^^oidmUtien, j^ ^j, history of colonization in the 

West than that which relates to the 
establishment, in the eighteenth century, of the 
Catholic Missions on the Pacific coast. In the year 
1767 the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico and 
forced to abandon the missions they had established 
in Lower California. But their work was taken 
up by the Franciscans, and under Fray Junipero 
Serra (one of the most heroic characters of his time) 
was extended until a chain of missions was estab- 
lished along the whole western coast of California. 
There were ten of these missions at the time of 
Father Junipero's death ; and the number was sub- 
sequently doubled. The mission system left its 
impress upon the whole history of California, and 
established a characteristic style of architecture 
which has attracted much attention of recent years. 
The late Helen Hunt Jackson made a valuable con- 
tribution to the historical literature of our country 
when she wrote of these Calif ornia missions in a series 
of magazine articles in 1883 ; and many readers 
will be pleased to see her papers upon Father Juni- 
pero and his work, the Mission Indians in South- 
ern California, and other related topics, gathered up 
and republished in " Glimpses of California and the 
Missions" (Little, Brown & Co.), with illustrations 
by Mr. Sandham. — Those who love the traditions 
that centre upon the mission system of that locality 
will wish that they might have found more extended 
treatment in Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard's inim- 
itable style, in his book entitled " In the Footprints 
of the Padres " (A. M. Robertson, San Francisco). 
All that it has to say about the Mission Padres is 
confined to a single chapter ; while the remainder 
of the book is devoted to entertaining papers upon 
other interesting phases of life in San Francisco at 
the time when the town of the " forty-niners "grad- 
ually gave place to the modern city, — the metrop- 
olis of the Pacific Coast. 



With the pages of his narrative evi- 
^**t'ffl»d«&^'^ dencing a painstaking capacity for 

minute research, Mr. Charles 
Knowles Bolton has collated from the published 
histories, biographies, diaries, correspondence, and 
other documents of the revolutionary period, an ex- 
haustive array of recitals, incidents, colloquies, and 
anecdotes, illustrative of the point of view of the 
rank and file of the continental army, which is pub- 
lished in a volume entitled " The Private Soldier 
under Washington " (Scribner). What steps had 
been taken toward the organization of that army 
before the conflict at Lexington, how the exciting 
news of that and other similar conflicts was spread 
throughout the scattered settlements of the colonies, 
how that army grew, notwithstanding many obsta- 
cles and difficulties, and the characteristic virtues

«Dd foibles of the men who entered the serriee, are 
here clearly set forth, as exhibited in the first sources 
of information so copionsly cited by the indastrioas 
writer. The army and navy were enforced com- 
petitors ; for the paasion for privateering often inter- 
fered with enlistments into the land forces, i^ fac- 
simile copy of one of Paul Jones's enlistment "broad- 
sides " of 1777. contrasted with copies of other 
" broadsides " inviting enlistments into the army ; 
and the illustrations showing the dress, accoutre- 
ments, arms, and equipment of the soldiers of the 
line, the requisitions made for supplies for them, 
the orders issued for their government, and the 
style of money paid them and their receipts there- 
for, unite to furnish a vivid picture of the conditions 
surrounding the men who fought for Independence. 
Much of the gossip of the revolutionary field, camp, 
and bivouac is here conveniently and agreeably 

summarized. 

The temerity it takes to write any- 
thing more about the slums is justi- 
fied, and on the whole amply justified, 
by Mrs. Betu's "The Leaven in a Great City" 
{Dodd, Mead & Co.). There is none of Mr. Riis's 
Dickens-like pietnresqueness in the book, nor of 
Miss Addams's philosophic grasp ; but the testimony 
to the present condition of slum-dwellers in New 
York is both sympathetic and expert. The text of 
the writer's arraignment is : " Not poverty, but the 
burden imposed by political corruption, is the blight 
of home-life in the tenement-house sections of New 
York." She makes it painfully clear how the help- 
less immigrant falls into the hands of the ward boss, 
who gives or refuses him work, determines his moral 
standards, and controls his vote. And she lays the 
blame at the door of the respectable citizen, espec- 
ially the church-member, who allows the ward boss 
to be. The book is not a tirade, however, bat a 
faithful and valid account of life in the tenements. 
It admirably supplements Mr. Riis's books by laying 
stress on the work of the women's and girls' clubs, 
and of the college settlement on Rivington street. 
Not all of the " leaven " is catalogued. Very little 
is told of the work of the churches, except its past 
inadequacy ; and even Mulberry Park is not men- 
tioned. But it is much to have given a clearer 
understanding of the slams, and of some of the 
spots therein that have been leavened. 

Mr. James Q. Howard's " History 
'Awtorv °^ ^^ Louisiana Purchase " (Calla- 

ghan) is made up of articles origin- 
ally sent to the newspapers by the Press and Pub- 
licity Department of the St. Louis Exposition, 
which are now collected and issued in book form 
" with the approval of the Exposition Company." 
The style of the book is bad, and the subject-matter 
is partly irrelevant and partly erroneous. The 
author's evident purpose is to exalt Livingston at 
the expense of Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. 
He does not grasp the combination of circumstances 
that caused the cession of Louisiana to the United 



lU-advUed 

Ai 



States, but he writes with so much assurance coupled 
with disparaging references to other books that he 
is likely to impose upon the novice. His most strik- 
ing claim is that William Beach Lawrence wrote in 
the interest of Monroe the " History of Louisiana " 
to which ^' the kindly Marbois, at the feeble age of 
eighty-three, lent the use of his name." This state- 
ment is unsupported by the slightest evidence, and 
is preposterous on its face. He also claims that the 
famous speeches of Napoleon relating to Louisiana, 
contained in Marbois, were transferred bodily and 
without credit from Garden's " History of Treaties," 
whereas the fact is that Garden wrote long after 
Marbois, and copied Marboisi nstead of Marbois's 
copying him. The speeches do not occur in the 
earlier work of Schoell, which Garden revised and 
enlarged. As reported by Marbois, they were doubt- 
less largely imaginary, according to the fashion of 
historical writing at the time, but they nevertheless 
accurately represented Napoleon's attitode toward 
the subject. The book closes with sketebes of the 
foremost nine heroes of peace and war, from Wash- 
ington to Grant, who, in Mr. Howard's opinion, 
" best teach patriotism and love of country by ex- 
ample."

The Irwin Press is the style of a Dew pnblishing 
coQcem reeently established in Pittsbnrg. The first 
publication of the firm is the new edition of " Mr. 
John Decastro," reviewed in our last issue. 

The complete works of John Lyly, now for the first 
time collected, are about to be issued from the Oxford 
University Press. Mr. B. Warwick Bond, M.A., has 
edited the volumes, to which he contributes a life of 
the author. 

A life of Joseph Parker, the late widely-known pas- 
tor of the City Temple, LoDdon, has been prepared by 
his long-time friend and associate, Dr. William Adam- 
son, and will be issued at an early date by the Fleming 
H. Revell Co. 

The Lothrop Publishing Company has recently ao- 
qoired from Small, Maynard & Co. all the rights in 
Mr. Richard Burton's three volumes of verse, " Dumb 
in June," " Memorial Day," and " Lyrics of Brother- 
hood"; and also in bis volume of essays, "Literary 
Likings," of which they are priating a new edition. 

In his forthcoming volume of "Biographical Sketches" 
Mr. James Bryce has made a collection of some very 
interesting articles which have from time to time ap- 
peared ia the leading English joarnals. Most of the 
men of whom he writes are those with whom he has 
been closely associated in public life and friendship. 
The Macmillan Co. will publish the book this month. 

A revised edition of Shakespeare's " Macbeth," as 
presented in the Variorum Edition, will shortly be is- 
sued by J. B. Lippincott Co., the publishers of that 
edition. The new volume will be the first to appear 
under the editorship of Mr. Horace Howard Fumess, 
Jr., the son of Dr. Horace Howard Furness, LL.D., the 
distinguished Shakespearian scholar, whose monamental 
work the Variorum Edition is. Father and son have 
worked together in the forthcoming play, bat it is the

intention of the elder Doctor Furness to relinquish the 
task of editorship of future volumes in the edition en- 
tirely to his son, who will take up the historical plays 
and probably present "Richard III." as the first vol- 
Dme under his individual editorship. 

The New Amsterdam Book Co. will shortly add to 
their " Commonwealth Library " a new edition, re- 
printed in unabridged form from the Andover edition 
of 1830, of Harmon's " A Journal of Voyages and 
Travels in the Interior of North America." 

A medical book of considerable literary interest may 
be expected in Dr. George M. Gould's " Biographic 
Clinics," to be issued shortly by Messrs. P. Blakiston's 
Son & Co. The volume is a consideration and diag- 
nosis of the ill-health of five English men of letters of 
the last century — De Quincey, Carlyle, Darwin, Hux- 
ley, and Browning. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. announce that the pub- 
lication of their three-volume edition of " The Speeches 
and Other Writings of Daniel Webster Hitherto Un- 
collected " has been postponed until after the holidays. 
This firm is about to begin the publication of a new 
subscription edition of the works of Daniel Webster in 
eighteen volumes. 

The death of Mrs. Mary Hartwell Catherwood, the 
day after Christmas, at the age of fifty-five, removed 
from the ranksof American novelists one of the most skil- 
ful and charming of recent writers. Her special subject 
was the romance of American history as found in Park- 
man and other chroniclers of the old life of the North- 
west — the life in which Indians, French, and English 
came into such interesting relations. In this field Mrs. 
Catherwood was a pioneer, for " The Romance of Dol- 
lard" was published in 1889, and soon followed by 
"The Story of Tonty," "The Lady of Fort St. John," 
and other pleasing reconstructions of a richly romantic 
period. Her most elaborate work, and her most suc- 
cessful from the publishers' point of view was the 
" Lazarre " of last year. On the whole, Mrs. Cather- 
wood has made a fresh and substantial contribution to 
our Active literature, and her death is a serious loss to 
letters, as well as a cause of profound grief to the many 
friends to whom she was endeared by a singularly gra- 
cious and winning personality. 

What will no doubt prove to be one of the most im- 
portant historical enterprises undertaken in this country 
of recent years is announced by the Arthur H. Clark 
Co. of Cleveland. This work will present (mainly in 
English translation) the most important printed works 
relating to the Philippine Islands, from 1493 to 1803; 
including also a large number of heretofore unpub- 
lished MSS., gathered from various foreign archives 
and libraries, which have thus far been most difficult 
of access. The material thus presented will comprise 
explorations by early navigators, descriptions of the 
islands and their peoples, their history, and records of 
the Catholic Missions, as related in contemporaneous 
books and manuscripts; showing the political, economic, 
commercial, and religious conditions of the islands from 
their earliest relations with European nations to the 
beginning of the nineteenth century. The series will 
be edited and annotated by Miss Emma Helen Blair, 
A.M., of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 
assistant editor of " The Jesuit Relations and Allied 
Documents," and Mr. James Alexander Robertson, 
Ph.B., also formerly engaged upon that work. An his- 
• torical introduction and notes are furnished by Mr. 
Edward Gaylord Bourne, Professor of History in Yale 



University, well known as an authority on early Span- 
ish discoveries and colonization in the New World. 
The series will include a very careful and extensive 
bibliography of Philippina — the most valuable that has 
yet appeared, and there will be an exhaustive analytical 
index to the complete work. The edition, comprising 
fifty-five volumes, is limited to one thousand sets. The 
first volume will appear this month.

A Tbrilling Story of Revolutionary Days 

For a Maiden Brave 

By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss, author of "The Strength of the Weak," "A Colonial Free Lance," 
etc. Illustrations in color by Frank T. Merrill. i2mo, cloth, ^1.50. 
"For a Maiden Brave" is a strilcing story. It moves rapidly, is full of incident, and the author has the gift 

for narrative. Historic homes and places are described, and the New York of those days is set before us. 

A Practical Book by a Practical Man 

The Work of Wall Street 

By Sereno S. Pratt, (Second Volume in Appletons' Business Series.) Illustrated. i2mo, 

cloth, $1.25 net; postage, 12 cents additional. 

With admirable clearness Mr. Pratt has performed well a task undertaken by no other writer. From an inti- 
mate connection, extending over many years, with the most trustworthy sources of information, he has written 
entertainingly of the marvelous machinery employed in what is now rapidly becoming the world's financial center. 
It would be difficult to mention any material fact relating to money or speculation of which there is not an adequate 
presentation. Mr. Pratt has assumed the position of an impartial observer, avoiding all straining for pictorial effect, 
and giving with commendable conscientiousness just the information desired by the outsider, and to be found in no 
other book. 

An Authoritative Book of Sports 

Racquets, Tennis, and Squash 

By Eustace Miles, Amateur Tennis Champion of the World ; American Tennis-Squash 
Champion, 1900. Uniform with "Taylor on Golf." Illustrated. i2mo, cloth, $i.bo net; 
postage, 16 cents additional. 

A Remarkable Psychological Study 

The Journal of Arthur S tiding 

Revised and Condensed with an Introductory Sketch. i2mo, cloth, ^1.25 net; postage, 12 cents 

additional. 

A true story of a man of education and culture who had high literary aspirations, his wanderings among pub- 
lishers and magazine editors, the impressions he gained by the way, and his death by suicide. 

An Important Book of Travel 

Through the Heart of Patagonia 

By Hesketh Prichard, Author of " Where Black Rules White — Hayti." With Twenty Illus- 
trations (some in Color) from Drawings by J. G. Millais, Author of "A Breath From the 
Veldt"; and a large number of Illustrations from Photographs. Small Imperial 8vo, $5.50 net. 
Mr. Prichard's long-expected book, "Through the Heart of Patagonia," contains a minute description of 
the daily life, manners and customs, and hunting methods of the Tehuelche Indians, the largest race on earth, long 
fabled to be giants. Their mode of life is curious, and so many conflicting accounts of them have been brought to 
England from Elizabethan times up to the present, that to have the caciques and tVit\x chinas brought before the eyes 
of the reader in a series of remarkable photographs and drawings gives exceptional interest to the book. The book 
is illustrated not only by photographs, but also in color and with black and white drawings by John Guille Millais, 
F. Z.S., the famous animal painter.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 53 



The celebration, last December, of Herr 
Bjbmson's seventieth birthday was marked by 
the publication of much interesting matter in 
the Scandinavian reviews, as well as by a 
"Festskrift" made up of contributions in 
prose and verse by a large number of the poet's 
friends. The matter thus brought to light 
includes a considerable fund of anecdote and 
reminiscence, from which we have thought it 
worth while to make a few selections for trans- 
lation and reproduction in these pages. Herr 
Edvard Grieg, the composer, relates the fol- 
lowing incident of the old days : 

•* It waa Christimui ere of 1868 at the Bjoraaon in 
Christiania. They lived then in the Roaenkrantignde. 
My wife and I were, as far as I can remember, the 
only guests. The children were verr boisteroos in their 
glee. In the middle of the floor an immense Christmas 
tree was enthroned and brightly lighted. All the 
serrant-folk eame in, and Bjomson spoke, beantifnily 
and warmly, as be well knows how to do. ' Now yoo 
shall play a hymn, Grieg,' he said, and although I did 
not quite like the notion of doing organist's work, I 
naturally eomplied without a murmur. It was one of 
Grundtvig's hymns in 32 — thirty-two Terses. I re- 
signed myself to my fate with stoicism. At the begin- 
ning I kept myself awake, but the endless repetitioMS 
had a soporific effect. Little by little I became as 
ataptd aa a mediom. When we had at last got throogh 
with all the verses, Bjornson said : ' Isn't that fine. 
Now I will read for you ! ' And so we got all thirty- 
two verses onee more. I was completely overawed." 

The following bit of personal address is from 
Herr Frits Thaulow, the well-known painter : 

" You were once chosen as president of the student 
society. There were wild rumors about that your op- 
ponents would hiss you and bombard you with rotten 
apples. In the afternoon yon paced back and forth 
over the threshold, and I easily understood that yon 
were nerTous and fearful. I tried to put in a eom- 
forting word, bat yon couldn't understand it in the 
least. Your trepidation was truly artistic. ■ It is al- 
ways so deneedly hard to begin,' you said, < I most be 
qnite sure of my beginning — until the sweat begins to 
stream from the pores, after that a speech takes eare 
of itself.'" 

Herr Thaulow also relates the following about 
a festive gathering of students : 

" The manager came in and announced with a lend 
Toice that it was past twelve. Then you sprang up. 

" ' Bring champagne I Now I will speak of what 
comes after twelve o'clock ! of all that lies bevond the

respectable hour for retiring ! For the hour when fancy 
awakens and fills us with longings for the world of won- 
derland; then the painter sees only the dim outline in 
the moonlight, then the musician hears the silence, then 
the poet after his thoughtful day feels sprouting the first 
shoots of the next. After twelve freedom begins. The 
day's tumult is stilled, and the voice within becomes 
audible.' 

" Thus you spoke, and ' after twelve ' became a 
watchword with us. 

" Many a spark has been kindled in your soul by the 
quiet evening time. But later in life, when you be- 
come a chieftain in the battle, broad daylight also made 
its demands upon you. Like the sun you shone upon us 
and made the best that was in us to grow, but 1 shall 
always keep a deep artistic affection for what comes 
•after twelve.'" 

Herr Werner Soderhjelm, who writes in 
Swedish of the poet's relations to Finland, is 
speaking of certain evenings spent with him 
in Paris, where both Finns and Scandinavians 
gathered together to recreate a bit of home 
beneath the alien skies of France. 

" He who has ever been present on one of these festival 
occasions, such as a Seventeenth of May festival in some 
beautiful spot near Paris, where Bjornson and Jonas 
Lie, inspired at once by the glorious memories of the day 
and the beauty of the natural surroundings, opened the 
warmest springs of their poetic hearts, and poured out 
streams of eloquence; and when afterwards, as the 
shades of night fell, all went home with Bjornson, and 
beneath his roof his daughter sang her father's songs, 
while in hushed and reverent mood we all turned to- 
ward the skald, as he sat there plunged in serious 
thought — he, who has been present on such an occa- 
sion, will keep the memory as one of the few that may 
never be matched again upon life's journey." 

When the poet purchased his estate in the 
Gausdal, his coming was looked forward to 
with mingled feelings by the good country folk 
of the neighborhood. Herr Kristofer Janson 
thus tells the story of his arrival: 

" His coming was anticipated with a certain anxiety 
and apprehension, for was he not a ' horrid radical ' ? 
The dean in particular thought that he might be a men- 
ace to the safe spiritual slumber of the village. As the 
dean one day was driving through the village in his 
carriole, just where the road turns sharply by the bridge 
below Aulestad, he met another carriole which was 
rapidly driving that way and iu it a man who, without 
respect for the clerical vehicle, shouted with all the 
strength of his lungs : ' Half the road ! ' The dean 
turned aside, saying with a sigh : ' Has Bjornson come 
to the Gausdal at last ? ' 

" It was indeed so, and he showed his colors at the 
start. The same dean and Bjornson became the best 
of friends afterwards, and found much sport in inter- 
changing genial jests whenever they met." 

Our remaining anecdotes are taken from a 
reminiscent paper by Herr Henrik Cavling, 
who writes chiefly of the eighties when the poet 
was living in Paris for a considerable portion 
of each year. 

" It was one of Bjomson's peculiarities to go ont as 



a rule without any money in his pocket. He neither 
owned a purse nor knew the French coins. His per- 
sonal expenditures were restricted to the books he 
bought, and now and then a theatre ticket. One day 
he came excitedly into the sitting- room, and asked: 

'"Who took my five franc piece?' It was a five franc 
piece that he had got somewhere or other and had stuck 
in his pocket to buy a theatre ticket with. It turned out 
that the maid had found it and given it to Fru Bjornson. 
For it seemed quite unthinkable to her that the master 
should have any money to take ont with him. 

" This complete indifference of Bjornson to small mat- 
ters sometimes proved annoying. In this connection 
I may tell of a little trip he once took with Jonas Lie. 

" The two poets, who did not live far apart, had long 
counted with pleasure upon a trip to Pere Lachaise, 
where they wished to visit Alfred de Musset's grave. 
At last the day came, and with big soft hats on their 
heads, and engaged earnestly in conversation, they 
drove away through Paris. 

" When they came to Pfere Lachaise, and wanted to 
enter the cemetery, the driver stopped them and asked 
for his pay. Then it appeared that neither had any 
money, which they smilingly explained, and asked 
him in bad French to wait and drive them home 
again. But the two gentlemen with the big soft hats 
had not inspired the driver with any marked degree of 
confidence. He made a scene, and attracted a great 
crowd of the boys, loafers, and well-dressed Frenchmen 
who always collect on critical occasions. The end of 
the affair was that the poets had to get into their cab 
again and drive all the long way back without having 
had a glimpse of the grave. When they reached Lie's 
lodgings. Lie went in to get some money, while Bjornson 
sat in the cab as a hostage. Nevertheless, both poets 
maintained that they had had a pleasant expedition. 
A Norwegian question, which had accidentally come 
up between them, had made them forget all about 
Alfred de Musset." 

Herr Cavling once asked his friend upon what 
occasion in his life he had taken the greatest 
pleasure in knowing that he was a poet. This 
was his reply : 

" It was when a delegation from the Right came to 
my house in Christiania and smashed all the windows. 
Because when they had thus attacked me and were 
starting for home again, they felt that they ought to sing 
something, and so they began to sing, ' Yes, we love this 
land of ours '; they couldn't do anything else! They had 
to sing the song of the man whom they had attacked.'" 

The last of our anecdotes is also related in 
the poet's own words. 

" 1 had a pair of old boots that I wanted to give to 
a beggar. But just as I was going to give them to 
him, 1 began to wonder whether Karoline had not some 
use for them, since she usually gave such things to 
beggars. So I took the boots in my hand, and went 
downstairs to ask her, but on the way I got a little 
worked up because I did not quite dare to give them 
to the beggar myself. And the further I went down 
the steps, the more wrathful I got, until I stood over 
her. And then I was so angry that I had to bluster at 
her as if she had done me a grievous wrong. But she 
could not understand a word of what I said, and looked 
at me with such amazement, that I could not keep 
from bursting into laughter."

Echoes fkom the south African 
Struggle.* 

The two books just issued from the hands 
of President Paul Kruger and General Chris- 
tiaan Rudolf de Wet serve to accent the evils 
of the censorship enforced by Great Britain 
during the recent war in South Africa. For 
Americans they contain little that is new or 
unexpected, while they seem to have been in 
many respects a revelation to the British read- 
ing public. It is readily conceivable that the 
conditions would be directly reversed if, say, 
President Aguinaldo and General Luna were 
to publish their version of the wap for conquest 
in the Philippines in Great Britain and 
America. In either event it may be said that ! 
the people of the United States and of Great 
Britain respectively have been informed con- 
cerning the two wars in inverse ratio to their 
direct interest in them — not the most reassur- 
ing element in free government, nor one to make 
either nation welcome militarism with any joy. 
Because the American newpapers have been 
able to print news from South Africa denied 
to the British press there is, therefore, little of 
novelty in the volumes under discussion, nor 
do they alter in any respect the opinion of 
their authors generally held by American news- 
paper readers of intelligence. Mr. Kruger is 
seen to be of a type little known in the United 
States, though his combination of evangelical 
religion and personal valor would not have 
seemed so strange to those of our ancestors 
who took part in King Philip's war, for ex- 
ample. Indeed, the fighting with the Kaffirs 
in the years following the Great Trek, in which 
the youthful Kruger, though little more than 
a boy, took a man's part, is often reminiscent 
of the dealings of the Puritans with the Wam- 
panoags and Narragansetts. General de Wet 
is more modern in every respect, but still with 
that touch of fanaticism which Calvinism, like 
Islam, breeds in its devotees. Both of the men 
tell their stories in Dutch, and both have had 
their writings translated into English by an 
anonvmous hand. Mr. Kruger's narrative is 
evidently one of selection, much of the mate- 
rial at his disposal being put aside to keep his

narrative within compass. It is better ordered, 
and written in a better style, than General de 
W^et's. On the other hand, the soldier's story 
of incessant fighting, though written with a dis- 
reo^ard for English idiom which often impresses 
the reader as a foreign accent might a listener, 
is easier to follow and more immediately inter- 
esting, in spite of its not containing the ample 
material for thought which inheres in the other. 
Perhaps the most impressive feature of Mr. 
Kruger's memoirs is his unfailing belief, from 
the first knowledge he obtained of the British 
nation, that England coveted the territory of 
the burghers and would stick at nothing to 
obtain it. In General de Wet's story one is 
continually struck with the fewness of the men 
composing the burgher commands ; and with 
these men, little disciplined as they were, ran an 
unexpressed contempt for the British as equal 
foes, much more galling, of a surety, than open 
boasting could Iw. Curious reflections arise, 
too, when one reads in both books the constantly 
recurring citations of the Scriptures and the 
unfailing belief that the fighting men of the 
two Republics were under the particular care of 
Jehovah — thus for once surpassing the British 
in one of their most salient characteristics. 

Mr. Kruger's book is a sad one, — the reflec- 
tions of an old and disappointed, but not em- 
bittered, man. His arraignment of his enemy 
is not wholly candid, but is quite as honest 
and fair as any presentation made against 
his people and policy. His life has been that 
of a pioneer, with savage men and savage 
beasts to conquer from the beginning, and the 
result shows itself in self-centering and self- 
sufficiency, the words being used in no invidi- 
ous sense. His was a hard school, but it can- 
not be said to have hardened his nature, or 
divested him of human sympathy. On the con- 
trary, the tone of sorrow pervading the book 
shows how deeply he has felt. It is not from 
these memoirs, of course, that the reader can 
learn how greatly indebted Mr. Kruger has 
been to the interferences of Great Britain for 
his prominence in the South African Republic, 
except in the information conveyed between 
the lines. One discovers that every time the 
element in the Republic which believed in pro- 
gression made substantial gains in public favor, 
some act of the British took place at a time 
suitable to throw popularity once more into the 
hands of the reactionary element of which Mr. 
Kruger was the natural leader. The figures 
given in the elections which elevated him to 
the presidency of the nation, too well known

to require citation here, are abundant proof of 
this, and support the contention of the English 
Liberals that a more conciliatory policy would 
have resulted in the elimination of Mr. Kruger 
and his fellow-pioneers from the politics of 
the Transvaal. The charge against Sir Alfred 
(now Lord) Milner of deliberately suppressing 
the portions of the conference of May 31, 1899, 
which made for peace, are repeated and rein- 
forced by documentary evidence, but this is al- 
ready an old story to Americans. So, too, is 
the presentation as a judicial farce of the trial 
of Doctor Jamieson and his companions in the 
raid, though this could have been drawn more 
strongly. The statement that it was this raid 
which led to the armament of the Transvaal is 
plain and indubitable. A minor detail, that it 
was the refusal of the Americans among the 
Uitlanders to cooperate with Doctor Jamieson 
under the British flag which brought about the 
failure of the daring scheme, has neither con- 
firmation nor denial. Throughout the book 
there is complete reluctance to state anything 
not personally within the knowledge of the 
writer, leading to a marked narrowing of the 
discussion. 

General de Wet, also, keeps within his own 
personal knowledge of events, and has nothing 
to say of any of the causes that brought about 
the war. He entered his country's service as 
a simple member of his commando, was elected 
to his first military office while absent from his 
fellows, and won his way by deeds rather than 
words. His language has not the restraint 
of Mr. Kruger's, and he frequently denounces 
those among his countrymen who failed in their 
patriotic duty. He is proud of the fighting 
qualities shown by those burghers who did 
fight, and he constantly bewails the lack of 
military discipline and knowledge in his forces. 
A more skilful writer could have made this 
story one of the most engrossing ever told, but 
the natural modesty of the man and his eager- 
ness to award credit to others divest it of 
much of its interest. Setting forth his admir- 
ation for General Cronje and his unwilling- 
ness to criticize him, he is none the less plain 
in his statement that Cronje could have made 
his escape had he not thought, along old-fash- 
ioned lines, that it was disgraceful to abandon 
his wagon train. After the gain in mobility 
due to the inhibition of wagons as part of the 
burghers' military equipment, such victories 
and reprisals as de Wet's own became fully 
possible for the first time. 

Mr. Kruger's book leaves him unreconciled 



to the British conquest — less than that could 
not have been expected. General de Wet 
dedicates his work to " my fellow-subjects of 
the British Empire," and concludes it with a 
prayer to his countrymen to be loyal to their 
new ruler. Neither expends any thought on 
the future ; but both quote Bismarck's apo- 
thegm that Africa is to be England's grave, and 
there is nothing to indicate that they do not 
believe it. Certainly the admiration both ex- 
press for Gladstone does not indicate too much 
confidence in those who have rendered his 
policy nugatory. Wallace Rice. 



" Friend of Thoreau."* 



Within Thoreau's " Familiar Letters " 
readers have gained some acquaintance with 
his New Bedford correspondent and friend of 
later years, Daniel Ricketson. Familiar also 
are the bust, now in the Concord library, and 
the medallion portrait of Thoreau, by Mr. 
Walton Ricketson. In their city home at 
New Bedford, surrounded with many rare 
volumes and relics of literary friendships, in- 
cluding Thoreau's spy-glass and flute, Mr. 
Ricketson, the sculptor, and his sister have 
prepared this memorial of their father and his 
most illustrious friends. Letters, journal- 
extracts, and poems are here collated, which 
reveal with graphic yet dignified intimacy the 
life of Mr. Ricketson in its subjective aspects 
and its relations with his literary associates. 
Mr. Ricketson once wrote of himself : "As for 
myself, if you will excuse an episode of egoism, 
I have achieved but little, nor have I desired 
fame. I have rather been the friend of good 
and noted men and women." To most readers 
the interest of this volume will centre about the 
friendship with Thoreau ; yet the personality 
of Mr. Ricketson gleams with a constant light 
which is far more than a reflection of influence. 
Mr. Sanborn has contributed a brief sketch of 
the life of this Quaker scholar and nature- 
lover, a life rounding out more than four-score 
years of earnest and genial activity. Mr. 
Ricketson's nature was essentially that of the 
lover, more than the writer, of books, though 
he published a " History of New Bedford," a 
volume of poems, and a few fragments. More 
social by temperament and affluent by circum- 
stance than his noted fri ends, he entertained

at his " Brooklawn " maDsioD, and in his 
" Shanty " close by, many famous men of con- 
temporary times, — abolitionists, poets, natur- 
alists, philosophers. His home was a refuge 
for all who were oppressed, and his legal 
training was always devoted to their ser- 
vice. His name will be most often associated 
with Thoreau, William Ellery Channing, Al- 
cott, and George William Curtis. The de- 
scription of Thoreau, as he approached Brook- 
lawn for his first visit, with his slight awkward 
figure, his large uncouth hat, his umbrella and 
travelling-bag, resembling "either a peddler 
or some way-traveller," has already been pre- 
served in print ; but no words can so ade- 
quately express that impression as the pencil- 
sketch by Mr. Ricketson here given, with 
sufficient hint of the cartoonist to intensify but 
not degrade the humor. The interchange of 
letters and visits between Ricketson and 
Thoreau. — a result of the former's enjoyment 
of " Walden," — filled the last eight years of 
Thoreau's life, from 1854 to 1862. " I recog- 
nize many of my own experiences in your ' Wal- 
den,' " wrote Mr. Ricketson, citing his simple 
tastes, his secluded " Shanty," his studious 
love of nature and her poets, and his deep 
devotion to the anti-slavery cause. He prof- 
fered to Thoreau an alluring invitation to visit 
him and the '* haunts that your very soul would 
leap to behold," — the Middleboro ponds whose 
charm was later recorded by the Concord 
naturalist. 

Of the score or more of letters included in 
this portion of the volume, some are now first 
published, others are already included in the 
" Familiar Letters," but all are interesting 
revelations of the mental vigor and courage, 
the high altitudes of thought and life, main- 
tained by Thoreau during these last years, 
often invalided for active work, by his con- 
fession " far, far from my best estate," yet 
contented and inspiring to the end. There 
are some terse notes of announcements, and 
occasional longer " genuine epistles." One 
misses, however, those more expansive 
thoughts, the utterances of his deepest mind 
and soul, found in the letters to Mr. Blake. 
Humor of typical baldness is interspersed with 
serious lore, while on every page one is im- 
pressed by the reserve and elusiveness of 
Thoreau's self-revelations. Among significant 
sentences are these : "I am engaged to Con- 
cord and my own private pursuits by 10.000 
ties, and it would be suicide to rend them." 
" The man's interest in a single bluebird is 



more than a complete, dry list of the fauna 
and flora of a town." 

Sequential from the correspondence with 
Thoreau are Mr. Ricketson's letters to Miss 
SophiaTborean, during her brother's illness and 
after his death. Later research has convinced 
us that Henry Thoreau was not alone a man 
of wonderful individuality, but that he be- 
longed to a family of remarkable mental and 
moral fibre. These letters from his sister, as 
well as a few published earlier by Dr. Jones, 
show intellectual vigor and a courageous ac- 
ceptance of all life's burdens, finding within 
her deeper nature ever " a singing soul." Her 
detailed iterations of her brother's patience, 
cheer, and "childlike trust," are full of rare 
tenderness and heroism. In one of his letters 
to her, Mr. Ricketson refers to his verses, im- 
provised during one of Thoreau's visits to New 
Bedford, when, in a mood of exhilaration, and 
incited by a spirited tune upon the piano, the 
poet-philosopher executed a strange rhythmic 
dance, slyly stepping upon Alcott's toes in 
his gyrations before the astonished company. 
These stanzas were later included in Mr. 
Ricketson's volume, " Autumn Sheaf." Their 
imagery and suggestion accord with one's im- 
aginative picture of such a scene. 

" Like the Indian dance of old. 
Far within the forest shade, 
Showing forth the spirit bold. 

That no f oeman e'er dismayed ; — 

"Like the dancing of the Hoars, 
Tripping on with merry feet, 
Triumphing o'er earthly powers. 

Yet with footsteps all must greet ; — 

" Like the Fanns, and Satyrs too, 
Nimbly leaping in the grove, 
Now unseen and then in view, 
As amid the trees they move." 



A few letters from Alcott, Channing, Dr. 
Japp, Mr. Salt, and other literary friends, offer 
material of reminiscent value, — in the main, 
memories or estimates of Thoreau. Mr. Theo 
Brown, referring to a call made by Mr. Blake 
and himself upon Thoreau shortly before thelat- 
ter's death, said : " His talk was up to the best 
I ever heard from him, — the same depth of 
earnestness and the same infinite depth of fun 
going on at the same time." Especially note- 
worthy and rare are two letters from the poet 
Channing, with his unique tributes to Thoreau's 
" brave and generous life " and his " superior 
scribbling faculty." 

In the journal-extracts and the poems by 
Mr. Ricketson, included in the last portion of 



4i 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



the volume, one may recognize that depth of 
thought, that remonstrance against tawdry 
standards of life, that studious love for nature 
and the English poets — especially Cowper, 
Thomson, and Gray, — which characterized 
this man of strong personality who yet re- 
joiced to be called " friend of Thoreau." 
Alcott, in his journal here cited, has a sen- 
tence of fine discrimination regarding the con- 
trasting devotions of Thoreau's two friends 
of later life : " Thoreau has visited R. be- 
fore, and won him as disciple, though not in 
the absolute way he has Blake of Worcester, 
whose love for T.'s genius partakes of the ex- 
ceeding tenderness of woman, and is a pure 
Platonism, to the fineness, and delicacy of the 
devotee's sensibilities. But R. is himself, and 
plays the manly part in the matter, defending 
himself against the master's twistiness and 
tough ' thorough-craft ' with spirit and ability." 

The poems of Mr. Ricketson, here printed, 
need the author's confession of " an impatience 
of rules." They are often infelicitous in form, 
but ever animated by spontaneous nature-love 
and religious faith. One is reminded of Whit- 
tier's bucolics and hymns in these less perfect 
stanzas, which include landscape-poems and 
peaceful domestic scenes. 

The volume is edited with the most delicate 
taste and sympathy. Its only marked defect 
is the lack of an index ; for here are many side- 
lights and direct facts which will be of service 
for later reference. Contact with such simple 
and strong natures as those of Mr. Ricketson 
and his literary friends must ever be conducive 
to more easeful and earnest thought, and less 
nervous tension of daily life.

territories and dependencies. This is, in brief, 
the view which modern international jurists 
take of the present relations between the 
United States of America and her recently 
acquired insular possessions. Such a relation- 
ship is entirely normal. "A Nation," it has 
been said, " is an organized community within 
a certain territory." Later writers name this 
conception a State. But every Nation may 
possess territory, as well as other property, 
external to the boundaries within which it is 
itself organized. This right is implied in the 
term " external sovereignty." As the author 
of the work before us states the theory : 

" The lands and populations which constitute the 
body and personality of the State are not the only 
lands and populations over which it may exercise 
power. It is a fact that the State may and does exer- 
cise power over lands and populations which are not, 
and cannot in the nature of things be, a part of the 
body and personality of the State, and that it may be 
in a permanent relationship to these lands and popula- 
tions of such a kind that it must exercise power over 
them permanently." 

To the United States pertain the same 
rights and privileges, in this respect, as are 
exercised by her fellow nations. What atti- 
tude she should maintain toward distant de- 
pendencies is a question that is new to her 
officials as a practical problem ; but the career 
upon which she has entered with the close of 
the nineteenth century has made this question 
imperative. Patrick Henry's " one lamp " 
must again become our resource. Other na- 
tions have had experience in administering 
government in extraneous territories. To 
illustrate historically our present situation in 
this respect by examples drawn from the an- 
nals of our fellows, as well as by our own past 
usages, is the aim of an elaborate treatise by 
Mr. Alpheus H. Snow, entitled "The Admin- 
istration of Dependencies." This writer has 
made an exhaustive study of the precedents 
found in French and English history, and has 
ably marshalled those which are of present 
value to us. The administration of her de- 
pendencies by France from 1600 to 1787, and 
the English administration prior to the charter 
of Virginia, are treated in separate chapters, 
following which the usages of England prior 
to her breach with her American colonies are 
copiously illustrated. The American Revolu- 
tion originated in a controversy over the ques- 
tion of the normal relations between the King 
of Great Britain and his American dependen- 
cies, and this controversy is set forth in extenso. 
The trend of colonial opinion at that time fol-

lowed the lines marked out before 1750 by 
the political thought of Europe. It was a 
transitional period, and the progress of change 
in the British constitution led to diverse views 
as to the nature of the British state and the 
constitution of her trans-Atlantic colonies. 
How the administration party and the colonial 
statesmen parted company after 1750, at which 
time the characteristics of the American con- 
stitution seemed to be clearly understood on 
both sides, is succinctly stated by Mr. Snow. 
The phases of the quarrel, and the demands 
and deliverances of both parties, from 1761 
down to the final breach in 1776, are fully de- 
tailed, as are also the successive steps taken 
by America thereafter, both in continuing her 
controversy with the mother-country, after 
ceasing to be a dependency herself, and in 
proceeding toward the administration on her 
own part of the territories that became her 
def)endencies. Herein we are furnished a brief 
history of the Revolutionary War from a new 
point of view, — namely, that of a contention 
over the relations between a dominant state 
and its dependencies, leading up to the assump- 
tion by the late dependencies of nationality 
for themselves, including incidentally the ex- 
ercise of their own government over their de- 
pendencies. After showing how the American 
system of such government grew to align itself 
with the European precedents, the author 
illustrates the styles of such government, fol- 
lowed, since the consummation of the American 
Revolution, by the European states, including 
Great Britain, as well as the course pursued 
by our own country, in all of which examples 
there is seen to be a practical similarity in 
principle. The chapter on American admin- 
istration from 1787 to 1900 includes citations 
from some of the decisions of the Supreme 
Court on questions that have arisen under the 
Federal constitution, — enough in number to 
illustrate the position taken by that tribunal, — 
and sufficient to show abundant precedents, both 
legislative and judicial, in our own experience, 
to guide to the solution of all the problems 
which have recently confronted the nation. 

" Colonial " and " Imperial " are among the 
terms extensively used, in recent years, in re- 
ferring to the relations newly assumed by the 
United States. The first of these adjectives is 
wrongly applied to the dependencies of our re- 
public ; and the second is largely used in that 
connection in a mistaken sense. This nation 
has no " colonies " in the proper meaning of 
that word, and never has had any. Colonies 



are one class of dependencies ; but all depend- 
encies are not colonies. Mr. Snow is careful to 
adhere scrupulously to his chosen subject, and to 
write of " dependencies " in the proper sense, — 
though one lapsus is perceptible in the sub-title 
which he chooses for his volume, " A study of 
the evolution of the Federal Empire, with spe- 
cial reference to American colonial problems." 

His frank adoption of the phrase " Federal 
Empire " shows that the bogey of " imperial- 
ism " does not affright this author. Disre- 
garding the old political sense of that term as 
indicating the despotic rule of an emperor, he 
freely uses it in its geographical sense. The 
extent of territory possessed by a nation which 
holds outlying lands in addition to its home 
domain is often well named an " Empire." 
Geographically, the United States may be 
aptly styled an " Imperial Domain," and this 
without any necessary implication of the other 
sense, in which the term describes a form of 
government. Modern developments in popular 
government have often given to a republic, 
whose political system is either representative 
or democratic, the possession of territories so 
extended and scattered that no terms so well 
describe the result as those which imply an em- 
pire in the geographical sense. " The British 
Empire " is a familiar example of such a do- 
main, from whose home government political 
imperialism is absent. Even a pure democracy 
may, as a dominant state, lord it over depend- 
encies as an imperial domain, without debasing 
its democracy. As the modern view is well 
summed up by Mr. Snow : 

*■ The old conception of an Empire as a Kingdom 
composed of Kingdoms, and of an Emperor as a Kiog 
who rules over other Kings, is passing away, and in its 
stead has come the conception of the Empire as a State 
composed of distinct and often widely separated popa- 
lations or States, of which a State is the Central Gov- 
ernment or Emperor." 

Vattel, in his time, had come so far as to see 
much new meaning in the term " empire," and 
to attribute to every nation, in addition to its 
own domain, the right of " The empire, or right 
of supreme command over persons, by virtue of 
which it orders and disposes, according to its 
will, of the whole intercourse and commerce of 
the country." But it was only a few years later 
that Burke, when discussing the relations be- 
tween Great Britain and her American Col- 
onies, said : " My idea of it is this : That an 
Empire is the aggregate of many States, under 
one common Head, whether this Head be a 
monarch, or a presiding republic." 

The idea that the United States should in

time become the "presiding republic" of such 
an Empire is by no means a new thought of 
the nineteenth century. Such a state as Great 
Britain was recognized to be in the eighteenth 
century, the early American statesmen often 
assumed to be the destiny of America. It was 
in this geographical sense that Madison, Ham- 
ilton, Jefferson, Ellsworth, Dickinson, Mar- 
shall, and others, — men whose partisan views 
were far from concurrent, — agreed in using 
the expressive phrase "American Empire." 
The precedents cited by Mr. Snow show how 
amply and continuously the actual practice of 
America in holding and governing her depen- 
dencies has justified this prophetic expression 
of the faith of the Fathers. 

The conclusion reached by Mr. Snow, as a 
result of these novel historical investigations, 
is that " the people of the American Union, by 
their written constitution, consented to by all 
the people of the Empire, have divided the 
governmental power under an unwritten Con- 
stitution, so that the Union is the Imperial State 
as respects the dependencies." Thus has been 
established a " Federal Empire," composed of 
" the people and lands of the American Union 
and the people and lands of its dependencies." 
The final chapter of the work is an exposition 
of the " Imperial Obligations " which are, by 
the establishment of this Federal Empire, 
" imposed upon the American Union and its 
people." This imperial state " has arisen out 
of the need for social and economic peace and 
for equalization of economic conditions, exactly 
as Confederations and Federal States arose ; 
it is the only form of organism by which the 
federative principle can be extended beyond 
the limits of lands occupied by a homogeneous 
population capable of self-government." 

The excerpts here given from this searching 
study into our colonial and national history will 
perhaps give some idea of its ambitious purpose. 
It is not merely a valuable contribution to the 
popular knowledge of our own institutions, — 
it is an epoch-making book, as a profound ex- 
position of the inmost characteristics of the 
unwritten constitution of the Republic. 

The work exhibits defects which are largely 
in matters of detail, and which detract some- 
what from its high character, but which are 
apparently due to the author's excess of enthu- 
siasm for his thesis. There is an unnecessary 
refinement of analysis, which furnishes no 
strength to his exposition or his argument, in 
the attempt to array the Revolutionary states- 
men against each other as Anti- Imperialists 



and Federal- Imperialists ; a distinction which 
the author does not suggest to have been under- 
stood by themselves, and which even he does 
not make clear. The same undue zeal has 
pressed too far some of his deductions respect- 
ing the positions occupied by the antagonistic 
parties prior to the Revolution. He regards 
it as established " as a fundamental principle 
of the Constitution of the British Empire for 
the American Colonies," that " the King was 
the representative of Great Britain as the Im- 
perial State, and that Parliament was also its 
representative, superior to the King "; and he 
insists that " nothing was better settled than 
that there were no constitutional conditions or 
limitations upon the power of Parliament when 
exercised within the realm of Great Britain." 
But the colonial statesmen disputed both of 
these claims as to the supremacy of Parliament, 
and supported their contention by English pre- 
cedents, legislative and judicial ; and the argu- 
ments of James Wilson and John Adams came 
near to demonstrating that once there had ex- 
isted limitations upon the power of Parliament, 
the benefit of which the colonists had not sur- 
rendered, and back to which they went in de- 
raigning their political rights. Omission of 
these superfluous statements would not have 
made any less effective or valuable the author's 
general conclusions, which his numerous quo- 
tations from historical sources abundantly 
sustain. James Oscah Pierce.

While society is constantly moving forward 
with eager speed, it is as constantly looking 
backward with tender regret. This paradox 
has been noted by Macaulay, among others, and 
he likens humanity to a caravan traversing an 
Arabian desert. All is dry and bare in the 
immediate vicinity, but far ahead and far be- 
hind is the semblance of lovely verdure and re- 
freshing springs. Yet when the traveller has 
hastened forward he finds nothing but sand 
where an hour before he had seen the mirror- 
like surface of a lake ; and, looking behind, he 
sees a lake where an hour ago he had been toil- 
ing through burning sand. It is this looking 
before and after and pining for what is not, 
that gives its peculiar charm to such a book as

the one under review. The careless gaiety and 
merry pranks of Charles the Second's court 
make rare reading, if we only shut our eyes to 
all the coarseness and vice and shameless prof- 
ligacy that accompanied them. Forcing our- 
selves for a brief space to this incompleteness 
of view, we shall find much in the volume on 
"Rochester and Other Literary Rakes" to 
smile over. From the pages of Pepys and 
Evelyn and Burnet, of Aubrey and Grammont 
and Wood, and numerous other contemporary 
writers, more or less reputable, the author has 
collected material sufi&ciently suitable and trust- 
worthy for his purpose. In cases of a conflict 
of authorities, he has, with impartial pen, set 
down both sides and left the reader to take his 
choice. Possibly the meaning of both " liter- 
ary " and " rake " has been somewhat stretched 
to include all the gay company to which we are 
introduced ; but we will not quarrel with the 
author for that. 

The curious theory is put forward that, just 
as diet influences character, so the literature 
of any given period may perhaps take its tone 
from the beverage common in that period ; in 
other words, brandy, wine, and beer are thought 
to impart each its peculiar flavor to the prod- 
ucts of the pen. In reading the poetic effu- 
sions of the inebriate Rochester, one may well 
believe him to have stimulated his fancy with 
something stronger than '* postum cereal." A 
century later Dr. Johnson certainly found co- 
pious draughts of tea conducive to a ready flow 
of ideas. It is. then, not too much to admit 
that the coarseness of the poetry and plays pro- 
duced by Rochester and his companions was 
entirely in keeping with their sensual indul- 
gence in alcoholic stimulants, and indeed with 
their pleasures and diversions of every sort. 
Not even at the church door were fun and frolic 
left behind. The king himself, although he 
liked to hear the anthems, furnished a shining 
example of unexemplary behavior during the 
rest of the service. Not only was he unable 
to preserve his gravity, but he took pains to 
let it be seen that he felt not the slightest in- 
terest in religion. He would play at '• peep " 
with Lady Castlemaine through the curtains 
dividing the royal box from the ladies' pew. 
When tired of this amusement, he would take 
a little nap, as is recorded in the scrap of verse 
not quoted by our author, but perhaps worth 
recalling here. It runs somewhat as follows: 

" Old South, a witty churchman reckoned, 
Was preaching once to Charles the Second, 
When lo! the king began to nod, 



Deaf to the zealous man of God, 
Who, leaning o'er his pulpit cried 
To Lauderdale, by Charles's side: 
•My Lord, why, 'tis a shameful thing; 
You snore so loud you'll wake the king!'" 

His easy familiarity with those about him is 
well known. Even when obliged to assert his 
dignity, he did so with grace and gentleness. 
William Penn, being admitted on one occa- 
sion to the royal presence, kept his hat on in 
accordance with the rules of his sect, but con- 
trary to those of the court. Charles, how- 
ever, uncovered. " Friend Charles," quoth the 
Quaker, " why dost thou not keep on thy hat?" 
" 'Tis the custom of this place," was the good- 
humored reply, " for only one person to remain 
covered." 

Among " the mob of gentlemen who wrote 
with ease " was the Duke of Buckingham. 
His readiness of wit was once shown at an 
early performance of one of Dryden's plays, 
an unlucky line of which ran thus, — 

" My wound is great because it is so small." 
Scarcely was this out of the player's mouth 
when Buckingham sprang to his feet and 
responded, in a voice clearly audible to the 
house, — 

" Then 'twould be greater were it none at all." 
This killed the play, but its author took his 
revenge in " Absalom and Achitophel." 

The favorite public amusements of the 
period were bear-baiting, bull-baiting, cock- 
fighting, and prize fights. Both Pepys, who 
was not over-squeamish, and Evelyn, who was 
more refined, have left accounts of such brutal 
sports. Even ladies were among the spectators. 
"After dinner with my wife to the Bear Gar- 
den," writes Pepys, " where ... I saw some 
good sport of bulls tossing of the dogs." And 
Evelyn records : " I went with some friends to 
the Bear Garden, where was cock-fighting, 
dog-fighting, bear and bull-baiting, it being a 
famous day for all these butcherly sports, or 
rather barbarous cruelty. The bulls did ex- 
ceedingly well. One of the bulls tossed a dog 
full into a lady's lap, as she sat in one of the 
boxes at a considerable height from the arena." 

To illustrate the table manners of high 
society, Pepys gives us an account of a banquet 
at the Guildhall, whither it was the fashion 
for courtiers to go and dine with the lord 
mayor. On one such occasion, when the din- 
ner was said to have cost between seven hun- 
dred and eight hundred pounds, we read that 
" under every salt there was a bill of fare," 
but that only the mayors and the lords of the 



46 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16» 



privy council had napkins or knives. Before 
the meal all the guests repaired to the buttery 
and drank wine, in preparation for the solid 
refreshment to follow. The dinner began at 
one o'clock. Pepys sat at the merchants' 
table. Ten courses were served, and there 
was also " plenty of wine of all sorts." The 
plates were wooden, and were not changed 
throughout the dinner ; nor, as it appears, 
were the drinking cups, which were of earthen- 
ware. 

To justify his choice of a title, the author 
devotes a chapter to the consideration of his 
rakes' literary productions. One couplet, from 
the ready rhymster, Rochester, will here suffice: 

" Our sphere of action is life's happiness, 
And he that thinks beyond, thinks like an ass." 

Such was his creed ; so he lived, and so he all 
but died. Bishop Burnet, however, was sent 
for by the dissipated nobleman as he lay on 
his death bed, and the churchman seems to 
have enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing the 
rake make a good repentance and die an edi- 
fying death — worn out by his excesses at the 
age of thirty-two. As to his virtues, the 
negative one of freedom from cant and hum- 
bug is ascribed to him, as well as to his asso- 
ciates in literary rakedom. 

" It Is true that there is little good and much evil 
to be learned from their writings, but what evil there 
is in them is avowedly evil. These writers did not 
expound upon the deep religious feeling of their athe- 
ism, or the immaculate purity of their illicit affections; 
nor did they call irregular alliances marriages in the 
sight of God though not in the sight of man. What- 
ever they may have been, they were not as a rule 
humbugs. With all its faults, their school was free 
from the atrocious affectation of the ' Euphuists ' of 
the reiiin of Queen Elizabeth, or, for that matter, from 
the almost as objectionable affectations of the many 
'ists and 'isms of the reign of a much later and im- 
measurably better queen." 

One service, at least, these literary rakes 
are held to have rendered to the cause of let- 
ters : they helped to establish the tradition that 
none are so noble as to be unsusceptible of 
further ennoblement by worthy performance 
in literature. From their time to ours have 
been handed down, from one noble or even 
royal personage to another, the torch of learn- 
ing and the honorable distinction of authorship.

Religion from "Vahious Points 

OF ViEAV.* 



We have received from the " Sign of the Hop-Pole," 
in Kent, England, a Christmas greeting in the form of 
a leaflet containing Christopher Plantin's sonnet " Le 
Bonheur de ce Monde," beautifully printed on Japanese 
vellum by the Chiswick Press in the French typography 
of Plantin's time. 



Dr. C. C. Everett, Bussey Professor of 
Theology in the divinity school of Harvard 
University, died in October, 1900. For thirty 
years he had delivered annually a course of 
lectures, at first entitled " The Science of Re- 
ligion," but finally " The Psychological Ele- 
ments of Religious Faith." During all this 
period their general substance remained the 
same, but they were changed in detail and em- 
bellished with new thoughts and illustrations 
each year. When his death brought the lec- 
tures to a close, there was a strong desire on 
the part of those who had heard them that 
they should be preserved in book form. It 
was found, however, that Dr. Everett had left 
no manuscript, and apparently had never 
written the lectures out. Under these circum- 
stances, recourse was had to the notes of a 
number of those who had attended the course, 
and from these Professor Edward Hale wrote 
out the lectures and prepared them for the 
press. 

One would not, as a rule, expect very much 
of a work prepared in the manner just ex- 
plained ; but Professor Hale has managed ta 
overcome the difficulties of the situation ta 
such an extent that I believe no reader would 
ever suspect what had been done if he were 
not informed. The work, as it stands, is a 
little masterpiece in its way, clear and forcible, 
singularly free from hysteria or dogmatism, 
and almost wholly without those technical 
terms which make many psychological writing* 
unintelligible to the man in the street. In the 
course of the book we are given three defini- 
tions of religion. The first is : Religion i» ' 
feeling, or essentially feeling. The primacy 
of feeling is insisted upon, as on p. 22 : "All 
that the intellect can do, however, is not too 
much to meet the highest feelings. Feeling 
has the primacy. Intellect is for the sake of 
feeling. What we do is done to gratify feel- 
ing. In science and philosophy feeling is the 
beginning, the middle, and the end." All

feeling, however, is not religions, and so we 
need the second definition (p. 88) : Religion 
is the feeling tovcard the supernatural. This 
is intended to include all religions : bat it is 
unsatisfactory inasmuch as the supernatural 
may include positive or negative, good or bad, 
elements. The devil represents the negative 
supernatural, •' The spirit that always denies." 
Hence we may reach a third definition, which 
is typical rather than inclusive : Religion is a 
feeling tovcard a Supernatural Presence tnani- 
festing itself in truth, goodness, and beauty. 
In this definition we may substitute " spirit- 
ual ■' for '■ supernatural," as a footnote informs 
us was done by Dr. Everett in his longer 
course of lectures. At the end of the last 
lecture we read : 

" The ideal religion, the one perfect religion, woald 
be that in which the presence of the Absolate Spirit 
shoald be fnllr recognized, and the ideas of the rea- 
son — truth, goodness, and beaatj — acknowledged as 
the content of this Absolnte Spirit. The various re- 
ligions of the work suggest and approach the ideal 
religion each to a greater or less degree. The ideal 
religion is like the pure air of the upper heaven as 
compared with the atmosphere of the earth. The 
lower atmosphere is everywhere different; it is vitiated 
bj mists and dust and smoke and all the various 
earthly elements; yet we breathe it, and find in it, with 
all its impurity, life and strength and refreshment." 

Dr. Everett held that the apparent decline 
in religious interest might be due in large 
measure to the fact that the higher types of 
religion did not appeal to so many as the older, 
lower, forms. " There is more true religion 
in half an hour's questioning, ' What wilt thou 
have me to do ? ' than in a whole lifetime of 
asking, 'What wilt thou do for me?'" (p. 
129.) Yet the latter thought is the one most 
prominent in the minds of many religions peo- 
ple of the baser sort, and the hope of personal 
reward and the fear of punishment are always 
prominent in low types of religion, whether 
they are labeled Christianity or otherwise. It 
is true, of course, that the highest religions 
have their basis in personal satisfaction or 
happiness : but this is spiritual, and oomes 
through a sense of unity with the all-pervasive 
spirit. 

" Theology and the Social Consciousness," 
by President King of Oberlin College, is based 
on a course of lectures delivered at the Harvard 
Summer School of Theology in 1901. It 
recognizes the " social consciousness " as a sig- 
nificant phenomenon in the ethical life of our 
time, and seeks to determine its relation to 
theological doctrines. The book is divided 
into three sections, headed respectively (1) 



" The Real Meaning of the Social Conscious- 
ness for Theology," (2) " The Influence of 
the Social Consciousness upon the Conception 
of Religion," (3) " The Influence of the So- 
cial Consciousness upon Theological Doctrine." 
The author insists equally njwn the essential 
like-mindedness of men and the sacredness of 
the person. We are to be compared, perhaps, 
to innumerable radii of a circle having their 
common source at one point, but each occupy- 
ing its own place and no other. The spiritual 
point of union of all human souls is what we 
call God. Hence the essential blessings of 
religion are capable of being shared by all, 
and emphasis is placed on that which is com- 
mon to the whole of mankind. The genius, 
who in one sense seems so apart, is he who 
recognizes great truths and laws, — that is, 
common and pervading, not exceptional things 
or remote. Jesus was a great religious genius 
(whatever else he may have been) and hence 
it is found that his doctrines are of universal 
application. 

It is often held that the early Christians, 
being nearest in point of time to Christ, were 
necessarily best informed and best able to 
understand his teachings. President King 
recognizes that in those days the teachings 
were new, or at least sufficiently so to fit with 
difficulty into the " mental platforms " of con- 
temporaries. It is a matter of history that 
many excellent and talented people were wholly 
unable to receive them. Since then, however, 
we have undergone a considerable intellectual 
evolution, and it is reasonable to suppose that 
the Christians of to-day are better fitted to 
receive the word (supposing it to be a true or 
universal word) than any before. At first 
sight, this conception seems in direct conflict 
with that of Dr. Everett mentioned above, 
that the later forms of religion may have less 
universal acceptance. Yet we have just seen 
that when Christianity was new it was received 
by few, and a superficial observer might have 
urged that it was obviously not fit for the mass 
of humanity. If religious thought has made 
no progress since that day, if Christ really 
spoke the final word, it may then be fairly 
urged that we are coming nearer and nearer to 
a common and universal religion. But if, as 
Dr. Everett assumed, religion is progressing 
just as science or art, the best must always be 
for the few, though what is to-day known to a 
minority will in time become common property. 
This is a condition of progress, spiritual, men- 
tal, or physical ; and we are reluctant to rec- 



48

ognize any exceptions to it. If Christianity 
seems an exception, it is only because it is still 
a long way ahead of most of us ; and that it 
should in reality be adopted by all is the best 
perhaps we are able to conceive. 

So much for President King's work. The 
above is not a very precise summary of his 
positions, and we had intended a little adverse 
criticism ; but it may be as useful to record 
the impressions the book gave as to attempt 
an exact summary of its contents. 

Dr. Cone, in his " Rich and Poor in the 
New Testament," examines the Scriptural say- 
ings relating to social subjects, and concludes 
that we find " neither a social philosophy, nor 
the foundations, nor the outlines of a social 
system." Yet he ends with these words : 

" We must leave it to the students of social science 
to point out in detail the means of solving the intricate 
problems that wealth and poverty force upon their 
attention. Our task has been accomplished if we have 
succeeded in showing how in a general way the ethical 
ideals presented in the New Testament may furnish 
guidance and inspiration in this great task. If we 
have not found any definite form of a system of society 
indicated in its pages, we have found, it is hoped, the 
basis of every true aud permanent social order because 
the foundation of all true living for the individual man. 
Let not men reject the spirit of its great teachings be- 
cause they stumble at the letter. Rather let them 
apply this spirit to the social problems of every age, 
and thus hasten the advent of the kingdom of brother- 
hood and peace." 

In interpreting the doctrines of Jesus, we 
think Dr. Cone has not sufficiently recognized 
the probable modifications due to their being 
reported by others, who, as we have just said, 
could not in the nature of things receive them 
without bias. It seems to the present writer 
that we may read between the lines, as it 
were, a more logical and spiritual philosophy 
than the written word sets forth. Jesus was 
surely the Great Emancipator, who preached 
the spiritual freedom of man, who saw that it 
was possible in a spiritual sense to rise above 
physical failure and misery. He did this in 
his own life, and his gospel was especially to 
the poor, for they most seemed to need it. 
The spiritual dignity of the human soul, its 
independence because of its dependence upon 
the great source of spiritual power, — here 
was an idea which made mere physical wealth 
or power seem trivial and insignificant. If 
the disciples looked for a physical millennium, 
it was only because they could not understand. 

" The Law of Growth," by the late Phillips 
Brooks, and " The Small End of Great Prob- 
lems," by Rev. Brooke Herford, are two books 



of sermons of which we can give no adequate 
summary in a small space. That they were 
good sermons, the names of the preachers are 
sufficient to assure us ; but they doubtless were 
better to bear than they are to read. The 
cheerful positivism which sounds well enough 
in the pulpit is sometimes a little trying in 
cold print. x. D. A. Cockerell. 



Briefs on New Books. 



An encyclopaedia is a serious under- 
Me^hnai." *ak'"g' involving great expense, 

years of preparation, and the col- 
laboration of great numbers of authoritative writers. 
A new encyclopaedia is more apt to be an old one 
patched up than a strictly new production, and 
this, of course, is a strictly justifiable proceeding 
when the old name is preserved, and no attempt is 
made to deceive the public. The need of an entirely 
new English encyclopaedia has been keenly felt of 
late years, and the need has at last been met by 
the "New International" of Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co. It is true that even in this case, some use 
has been made of the old " International " text, 
but only where that text remains valid in the light 
of the most recent knowledge. To all intents and 
purposes, the work of which three volumes are now 
at hand is a new compilation of universal knowledge, 
and has been edited with skill and conscience by 
President Gilman, Professor Peck, and Mr. Colby, 
aided by a large staff of competent specialist 
writers. It is an encyclopaedia of the Brockhaus 
or Chambers type — that is, a work made up of 
many brief articles rather than of a smaller num- 
ber of extensive treatises. The letter A, for ex- 
ample, aside from the geographical articles (Africa, 
Asia, Australia, Austro-Hungary, and America) 
yields only two articles (Archaeology and Armies) 
that are more than ten pages in length. In fact, the 
article that exceeds a single page is rare in pro- 
portion to the number that consist of single brief 
paragraphs. The work is thus made exceptionally 
useful for ready reference, which should be, after 
all, the chief purpose of an encyclopaedia. Although 
a list of special writers is printed in the forefront 
of the work, it is distinctly explained that these 
contributions have been revised and amended by 
the oflBce staff, so that no article of any length is 
to be considered the work of a single writer. In 
the subdivision of matter, we find even such minor 
entries as are usually sought out in Readers' 
Handbooks and other reference works of like char- 
acter. Geography, biography, and science, are 
subjects that have been given an unusual degree of 
attention, and in the matter of lucidity and general 
attractiveness of style the work has been well done. 
The illustrations are numerous, and the full-page 
plates are unusually attractive, although the raison

d'Ure of their selection is not always obvious. We 
are glad, for example, to have the colored plate 
which gives ns six familiar varieties of the apple, 
bat we could imagine many other subjects equally 
deserving of such elaborate illustration. The maps 
are numerous, and like moat maps in American 
books are made inartistic by crude coloring and 
ugly lettering. The physical maps are much better 
done. The third volume of the work ends with 
Canada, and there are to be seventeen in all, 
including something like sixty thousand articles. 

The simple record of an honorable 
life, whose main incidents are replete 
with inspiration for American youth, 
is presented in Dr. William Lawrence's biographi- 
cal sketch of the late Governor of Massachusetts, 
the Honorable Roger Wolcott (Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co.). The biographer is the Bishop of the 
Episcopalian Church in Massachusetts, who honors 
himself in overlooking denominational boundaries, 
in his zeal to furnish an early biography of his 
great fellow citizen. With a facile pen, and in 
easy flowing style, he recounts the principal events 
in the career of the Harvard scholar, orator, patriot, 
public servant, and man of affairs, whom the Bay 
State was delighted to honor in many capacities. 
It is but a brief sketch of a life which has been all 
too brief ; but its agreeable diction, and the nobility 
of the subject of the sketch, charm the reader at 
every page. The eminent public services of Gov- 
ernor Wolcott are narrated without prolixity, but 
with due appreciation of their value to his country- 
men. Numerous extracts from his addresses and 
speeches make the book a portfolio of eloquence ; 
among these is his acknowledgment, in behalf of 
the Commonwealth, as her Governor, of the receipt 
from England of Bradford's original manuscript of 
the "History of Plimoth Plantation." In this 
little masterpiece of American oratory, the speaker 
thus exalts the Pilgrim Fathers : " In the varied 
tapestry which pictures our national life, the richest 
spots are those where gleam the golden threads of 
conscience, courage, and faith, set in the web by 
that little band." This gem of speech is worthy to 
rank with Lincoln's " The mystic chords of mem- 
ory." It is a fair example of the general character 
of Mr. Wolcott's public deliverances. 

An ■up-to-date ^^ '* °®'' ^°** much to say that the 
ireatueon need of a work which should satis- 

Copyrighi law. f actorily gather into a single volume 
the large and confused mass of legal enactment 
and decision on the question of Copyright has never 
been so satisfactorily filled as by the book prepared 
by Mr. E. J. MacGillivray, LL.B., and bearing the 
fully descriptive title, " A Treatise upon the Law of 
Copyright in theUnited Kingdom and the Dominions 
of the Crown, and in the United States of America, 
Containing a Full Appendix of All Acts of Parlia- 
ment, International Conventions, Orders in Council, 
Treasury Minutes, and Acts of Congress now in 



Force" (Dutton). Unlike nearly all of its pre- 
decessors in this field of continually growing im- 
portance, the book is concerned with questions of 
Copyright alone, and does not confuse this topic 
with any reference to patent and trade-mark cases. 
On the historical side of the question, it hardly does 
more than refer the reader to the standard works 
of Messrs. Copinger, Scrutton, and Drone, with an 
especial commendation of Mr. Augustine Birrell's 
"The Law and History of Copyright in Books," one 
of the few law treatises that have positive and in- 
trinsic literary merit. Mr. MacGillivray occupies 
himself with accounting for things as they are 
rather than as they were, or (a frequent chapter in 
such volumes) on things as they ought to be. He 
has not much to say about the common-law on the 
subject, — wisely enough, since the abrogation of 
the common-law principle of ownership in publica- 
tions and works of art by statutory tinkering has 
left the author and artist with little but regret 
But he does give all needful information for the 
perfect understanding of the English and American 
law as it exists to-day, so far as that is comprehen- 
sible. The long-delayed promise of a consolidated 
act on Copyright in Great Britain is another oc- 
casion for apology, since the law there is left in 
a condition where precedent rather than precise 
statement governs, — the book throughout being 
therefore an excellent example of case law. The 
condition of Copyright in the United States occu- 
pies the latter half of the book, containing sixty- 
eight pages as against more than two hundred on 
the subject in general and as particularized in the 
British dominions. In both parts the work is 
brought almost into the living present, the one no- 
ticeable omission on the American side being the 
question of copyright in news, an important topic 
in this country, especially since a recent decision 
has given such rights to a monopoly with the ut- 
most power for harm, whether so used or not. In 
spite of the fact that this is a formal book of law, 
Mr. MacGillivray is at times entertaining, and his 
work is admirably digested, fully organized, pro- 
vided with all needful indexes and appendices, and 
certain to fill an important place hitherto vacant. 

It is always a grateful thing to see 
that justice is done to some person 
or cause maliciously aspersed in this 
curiously dealing world. The name of Sappho has 
always been one that has worked marvels ; the 
fame of the world's chief poetess has been freely 
accorded her ; her successors in her art have made 
translations or paraphrases of her poems, and then 
have unhesitatingly acknowledged that they have 
undertaken a task that was impossible ; writers, 
statesmen, readers of all classes, have repeated her 
praises, admitted her claims, placed her in an 
unassailable pre-eminence. We may quote from 
Mr. Symonds : " The world has suffered no greater 
literary loss than the loss of Sappho's poems. So 
perfect are the smallest fragments preserved that

[Jan. 16, 



we muse in astonishment to think what the com- 
plete poems must have been. Of all the poets of 
the world, Sappho is the one whose every word 
has a peculiar and unmistakable perfume, a seal of 
absolute perfection and inimitable grace. In her 
art she was unerring." But, on the other hand, 
the character of Sappho has been subjected to a 
very different treatment. She has come down the 
ages enveloped in a cloud of story and allusion 
which allows but vague and difficult appreciation 
of what she really was. The Comic Dramatists 
have played havoc with her life and activity, their 
comments and veracious interpretations have passed 
current, and it needed the labors of Welcker and 
Blass and Wharton to bring about a rehabilitation 
of the poetess. In her " Lost Letters from Lesbos " 
(Donnelley), Mrs. Lucy McDowell Milburn has 
carried on the alluring labor. The " Lost Letters " 
were found by one of those miracles which come 
only into the experiences of novelists and poets, 
and they are the letters which Sappho wrote to 
that Egyptian lover who is supposed to have been 
one of the Egyptian Kings. The old Greek life, 
with its freshness, its charm, its poetry, reappears 
in these letters. Both the prose and the verse 
recall the Lander clearness and magic. The per- 
sonality of Sappho as revealed in these intimate 
outpourings diflfers by the whole diameter of being 
from the Sappho of the Comic Dramatists. She is 
what the greatest poetess of all time surely ought 
to have been. Mrs. Milburn has put into these 
letters her high idealism of thought and belief, and 
has made a picture which the lover of Greece will 
gladly admit into his memory. Its imaginative 
insight will help to make plain many things which 
history leaves obscure, and the book ought to find 
appreciative readers everywhere. 

A new series of biographical art- 
Brii^h^Ari."'^ Studies is begun with four volumes 

(imported by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons) under the general title " The Makers 
of British Art." Mr. James A. Manson, the editor 
of the series, writes of Landseer, pointing out in 
his preface the surprising meagreness of material 
for an adequate and sympathetic biography, and 
the consequent necessity of making his art-work 
tell the whole story of his life. The volume on 
Turner is written by Mr. Robert Chignell, who 
aims to do better justice to the man, in distinction 
from the painter, than have previous biographers. 
No special originality is claimed for the life of 
Reynolds, by Elsa D'Esterre Keeling, except its 
attempt to steer a middle course between the 
extremes of unreasoning laudation and careless 
dispraise, — two attitudes so often adopted toward 
this painter. In the volume on Romney, Sir Her- 
bert Maxwell attempts to collate the three previous 
biographies of Cumberland, Hayley, and John 
Rumney, and thus to arrive at a proper under- 
standing of the artist and his work ; a feature of 
the book is the excellent catalogue of Romney's 



works, — probably the fullest that has yet been 
compiled. Each biography is supplied with ap- 
pendices, a bibliography, and a complete index for 
the student's use. Each has a photogravure por- 
trait, and about twenty plates. These are printed 
on good paper, and are distinct and thoroughly 
satisfactory, especially in the case of Landseer's 
work, which lends itself particularly well to this 
sort of reproduction. 

Some sensible things sensibly stated 
Six ,enMie ^^^ f^^^^ j^ j), j^jj^^j j Savage's 

" Men and Women (American 
Unitarian Association). The six chapters of the 
book are on " Man and Woman," "Love and Mar- 
riage," " Parent and Child," " Home and Society," 
" The Ethics of Divorce," and " The Growing 
Independence of Women." They speak to the 
reader in a simple, conversational tone, and ap- 
pear to have been put forth originally as pulpit 
discourses. While it is impossible that all readers 
should agree with everything these little homilies 
contain, the book is at least thought-provoking, and 
its utterances have the prime essential of thorough 
sincerity and reasoned conviction. One or two 
seed thoughts may be given here. The author be- 
lieves there is danger of too much organization for 
reform, for civic study, for literary and artistic cul- 
ture. A person joins a society, or club, or lecture 
class, and that is too often the end of it ; a passive, 
recipient attitude takes the place of energetic indi- 
vidual action. And the same is true in religioas 
matters. The divorce question is ably discussed, 
and attention is called to the curious fact that al- 
though the United States has the most liberal of 
divorce laws, its morals are of the highest, and no- 
where else does woman hold a position of such re- 
spect and dignity. Indeed, a certain freedom of 
divorce is necessary for the safeguarding of her in- 
terests and her independence. The immense harm 
wrought by the reckless application of scripture 
texts to modern conditions receives a fitting word. 
" He that spareth bis rod hateth his son," still gives 
sanction to a mode of discipline regarded by the 
author as worse than brutal. He says, " I do not 
believe that any father or mother on the face of 
this earth has the right to strike a child. I would 
call it brutal if it were not a libel on the brutes. It 
seems to me utterly inexcusable, always and every- 
where."

Roman gardens, with which horticulture in En- 
gland began, though known to have existed, must 
be conjecturally reconstructed from relics or from 
Greek and Roman models. The early monastic 
gardens, likewise, must be described chiefly in terms

of " what we may well believe." But there are 
facts aboat the mediwval pleasaunce, and even one 
or two gurvivals of it still to be found in England. 
With the Tudor period, gardens take on more of their 
modem aspect, and since then their development 
has been steady, if along diverse lines. The final 
chapter of Miss Nichols's book deals with the gar- 
dens of to day, under the broad division into natur- 
alistic and formal, and discusses briefly the relative 
merits of the two styles. Miss Nichols has fur- 
nished over three hundred photographs and draw- 
ings for her book, and there are eleven plans by 
Mr. Allen N. Cox. The whole history goes to show 
that English horticulture is a craft, not an art, and 
that it still lacks fundamental and admitted prin- 
ciples. But apart from this thesis, and from the 
suggestive value which the book will have for the 
professional horticulturalist (who will especially 
priie the bibliography), it is popularly written and 
will be of real interest to the general reader. 

■ .. A fair and succinct summary of the 

f(f emr nmiimtit gubstance of the recent shower of 
«^F*"***»- "centennial" publications on the 

Louisiana Purchase, and kindred essays illustrative 
of the geographical expansion of our country, ap- 
pears in a small and compact volume entitled '"The 
Territorial Growth of the United Sutes," written 
by Mr. William A. Mowry and published by 
Messrs. Silver. Burdett & Co. From an evidently 
careful study of this phase of our national life, the 
author has compiled chapters in which, in con- 
densed form, the salient facts are stated concerning 
our several arquieitions of territory, by the treaty 
with Great Britain in 1783 ; the Louisiana, Florida, 
and Texas cessions ; and also those in the cases of 
Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippine 
Archipelago. Oregon is the only territory of large 
importance to which we have acquired a right by 
discovery and occuf)ation ; and the subject of these 
and our other claims to Oregon is well summed up, 
being properly accorded great«r space than any of 
our other landed acquisitions. A series of thirteen 
colored maps illustrates pictorially the situation at 
each of the successive steps of our national expan- 
sion, and makes clear the relative value and extent 
of each accession of territory. Thus we are fur- 
nished a hand-book, suitable for ready reference, 
which will be a great convenience to the many 
who, while interested in these historical and geo- 
graphical subjects, have not shelf room in their 
libraries for the more extensive treatises that the 
enterprise of poblisbers has lately multiplied. 

Around the life-story of the Gracchi, 
Sulla, Crassus. Cato, Pompey. and 
CaB$ar. Professor Oman, in his book 
on "Seven Roman Statesmen" (Longmans), has 
certainly woven a very readable sketch of the period 
of Roman history to which these names belong. In 
his opinion, the reaction against the biographical 
element in history-writing has gone too far, and it 






is tame to look at Roman history again with Plutarch 
before us no less than Mommsen and Marquardt. 
In general, the view expNMed is that the Roman 
republic went down because of its inability to bear 
up the burdens entailed by its own expansion ; and 
its occasional reformers, whether democratic or aris- 
tocratic, failed of success from their ignorance of 
the deeper features of the problems before them. 
Without under-rating the insight and ability of Julius 
Caesar, Professor Oman strikes telling blows at the 
idealized Cse»ar of the German school, as so many 
other recent writers have done. The empire of 
which CsBsar laid the foundations was a period of 
mere soulless material prosperity, — a magnificent 
failure, whether considered as a despotism or a 
bureaucracy, lapsing gradually into moral and phys- 
ical impotence, and destined to sink into the Chinese 
type of stagnation but for the assaults from without 
and the new ideals of Christianity within. The 
trained historical student will perhaps prefer some- 
thing of a different type, but the average intelligent 
reader will find this volume both stimulating and 

profitable. 

" How to Attract the Birds, and 
^^T^J^J^JUJ^Ij^ Other Talks about Bird Neighbors" 
*^ is the title of a new book by " Neltje 

Blancban " (Mrs. Doubleday), similar in its charm- 
ingly intimate and suggestive style to her other 
books about birds, but shorter and more desultory, 
each chapter being complete in itself and connected 
loosely, if at all, with the other chapters of the 
work. The first essay, " How to Invite Bird 
Neighbors," is perhaps the freshest and most inter- 
esting. It is full of novel suggestions to the land- 
owner who wants to persuade the birds to nest in 
his garden or orchard and under his eaves. The 
second chapter is devoted to some special means 
of keeping the ruby-throat with us through the 
summer. The others deal, in fresh and original 
fashion, with various habits of the birds ; and there 
is a chapter on '• What Birds Do for Us " calcu- 
lated to convince even the owners of cherry-trees. 
The book is beautifully illustrated with a great 
number of remarkable photographs that catch the 
birds in all sorts of interesting and unexpect«d 
situations, and in themselves make us feel better 
acquainted with oar bird neighbors. (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.). 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The book which Mr. Percival Chubb has written on 
" The Teaching of English in the Elementarr and the 
Secondary School " (Maemillan) is so sound in its phi- 
losophy and so practical in its belpfnlness that we wish 
it might come into the hands of every instructor in the 
country who is engaged with this vastly important 
subject. It is based upon the fundamental principle of 
"unity and continuity in the Eoglish course from its 
begioDing in the kindergarten up through the high 
school." We doubt if so good and useful a book upon 
the subject has before been written, and the author's

treatment is charming in style besides being based 
upon the most intelligent principles of pedagogy. If 
the spirit of this book could once find a permanent 
lodgment in our schools, it would work a revolution in 
methods, and secure for English its proper place in 
the educational scheme. 

It is not often that the play-goer can take with him 
to the theatre, or read beforehand, such admirable 
translations of foreign dramas as are provided by Mrs. 
Edith Wharton for Herr Sudermann's " Es Lebe das 
Leben" ("The Joy of Living," Scribner), and by Mr. 
Arthur Symons for Signor d'Annunzio's " Francesca da 
Rimini " (Stokes). The latter reproduction is, in truth, 
not so much a translation as a noble English poem, and 
should prove a cause of much gratitude in admirers of 
Signora Duse who cannot read Italian. 

The late Bishop of Oxford did no more important 
work in his chosen historical field than that which he 
contributed to the Rolls Series, in the form of pref- 
aces to the volumes which he edited. Mr. Arthur 
Hassall has done us a distinct service by editing, in a 
single volume, these " Historical Introductions to the 
Rolls Series," thus placing this valuable material within 
the reach of every student. The volume is published 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

Charles Sumner's " Addresses on War," with an 
introduction by Mr. Edwin D. Mead, is a volume pub- 
lished by Messrs. Ginn & Co. for the International 
Union. This publication is in the interest of the peace 
movement to which Mr. Ginn is now devoting much of 
his energy and his means, and is offered at the cost of 
production. It includes the three great addresses: 
"The True Grandeur of Nations," "The War System 
of the Commonwealth of Nations," and "The Duel 
between France and Germany." 

Two reprints of old English plays have recently 
come to hand, one edited by Mr. F. I. Carpenter of 
the University of Chicago, the other by Mr. Arthur H. 
Quiun, of the University of Pennsylvania. The Chi- 
cago book inaugurates the octavo series of the uni- 
versity's Decennial Publications, and gives us, with 
much learned apparatus, the text of Lewis Wager's 
" The Life and Repentaunce of Marie Magdalene," a 
morality play dating from about the middle of the six- 
teenth century. The Pennsylvania book is a reprint of 
the anonymous comedy, " The Faire Maide of Bristow," 
published in 1605, and variously attributed to Day, 
Wilkins, Armin, and Barnes, although upon no good 
evidence in any one of the four cases. The present 
editor gives it up. This play was translated into Ger- 
man by Tieck nearly a century ago. Both of these 
plays are now reprinted for the first time. 

A book called "The American Idea" (Dodd) is a 
compilation by Mr. Joseph P. Gilder, of the typical 
American documents — Declaration, Articles, Constitu- 
tion, speeches by Washington, Webster, and Lincoln, 
the Monroe Doctrine, etc. Speeches by the last three 
of our Presidents are included — a very dubious 
choice — and both Senator Hoar and Secretary Hay 
are represented. The extract from Lowell's " De- 
mocracy " belongs here with better right than several 
of the other selections. The idea of this book is not 
exactly a new one, but similar collections heretofore 
have been planned for school purposes rather than for 
the use of the general reader. The editor contributes 
a sophomoric introduction that might better have been 
omitted. A man who will talk about " Old Glory " 
deserves no quarter.

The Introductions to Plato 

By Benjamin Jowbtt, Late Master of Balliol College 

and Professor of Greek in the University of Oxford. 

Edited by Lewis Campbell, M.A., LL.D. 16mo. 

Cloth, 85 cents. 

"A wish has often been expressed that the late Master of 
Balliol's Introductions to his translations of the Platonic Dialogues 
might be published in a separate form. This step has hitherto 
been prevented by considerations which it is unnecessary to men- 
tion here. But it was thought that a select number of significant 
passages in which Professor Jowett had made Platonic Interpreta- 
tion the vehicle of his own thoughts might be of interest and use 
to many persons, for whom the examination of five octavo volumes 
might seem too formidable a task." — From the Pre/ace.

The McClurg Books of 1902 

r HE following publications were issued by A. C. McClurg &■ Co., Chicago, 
during 1902. The list includes some very notable books, and some which 
have set new paces in the publishing world. No pains have been spared to secure 
■new and striking effects in the manufacture of these boohs, without, however, in 
any respect departing from the accepted canons of good taste. Bindings and 
illustrations have had especial attention, and typography and presswork are all 
that the facilities and experience of the largest and most competent book-printing 
bouse in America could make them. 



i JTiction 

Third Edition 

The Conquest 

By Eva Emery Dye 
•• No one who wishes to know the true story of the conquest 
of the greater part of this great nation can afford to pass by this 
book." — Cleveland Leader. 

"None of the popular historical novels of the last two or three 
years can compare with this in value, or will be apt to keep pace 
with it in popularity." — San Francisco 'Bulleiin. 
With Frontispiece, $1.50 

On Fortune's Road 

Stories of Business 

By Will Payne 

" He has the ability to see and to draw clearly the picturesque 

and striking features of the most prosaic situation. The whole 

book has the vivid quality of a snap-shot photograph, it is so 

real." — Philadelphia Telegraph. 

Illustrated, $1.50 



The Holland Wolves 

By J. Breckenridge Ellis 

"A thrilling and delightful romance of the days when King 

Philip of Spain sent his armies to Holland . . . one of the best 

stories of its kind of the season, and there are unusually good 

fuU-page illustrations." — Buffalo Express. 

Illustrated, $1.50 

Second Edition 

A Captive of the Roman Eagles 

Translated from the German of Felix Dahn 
" He describes with dramatic power and positive accuracy, the 
life of those far-oflf days. Such fiction is of the highest literary 
value. It redeems the appellation ' historical novel ' from execra- 
tion and oblivion." — Louisville Courier Journal. 
$1.50 

The Prince Incognito 

By Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer 
"Her hero is Rinaldo D'Este, cousin to Louis XV. of France, 
who decides to give up his rank and title for the Huguenot girl he 
loves. The young prince and his wife escape to the New World, 
having desperate adventures and manifold trials. The romance 
is full of color and imagination, carrying the reader buoyantly to 
the closing word of an unusually entertaining novel." — Philadel- 
J>hia Public Ledger. $1.50 



Sixth Edition 

The Thrall of Leif the Lucky 

A Story of Viking Days 
By Ottilie A. Liljencrantz 
"A story that has all the glamour of the old romance. Here 
we see the men even as they lived, who harried the coasts of Eng- 
land, who discovered Greenland centuries before Columbus was 
born and carried the gospel thither, the Vikings, the stalwart 
Norsemen, the masters of the sea a thousand years ago." — Chicago 
Journal. 

" One of the best stories of the year, and the pictures are as 
unusual in quality as the story." — Milivaukee Sentinel. 
Illustrated in color, $1.50

garden are therein." — Neiv Orleans Times-Democrat.

The Point of Honour 

By H. A. HiNKSON 
" It deals with the gentlemen of Ireland in the eighteenth cen- 
tury. ... Of modern Irish writers of fiction not one is within 
gunshot of Mr. Hinkson for brilliancy, dramatic quality, high 
spirits, and magnificent swing and sweep of narrative." — Chicago 
Evening Post. $1.50 

Gertrude Dorrance 

By Mary Fisher 
" Gertrude Dorrance is a most engaging young person, who 
has the luck to charm three men. and surely that is enough love 
for any one of normal taste. The story is very well written, and 
the reading of it will induce reflection. But it is, in addition, a 
good story." — Philadelphia Telegraph. 
$1.50 



Birds of the Rockies 

By Leander S. Keyser

PUTNAM'S NEW PUBLICATIONS 



ST. AUGUSTINE AND HIS AQE 

By JOSEPH McCABE, author of " Peter Abelard," etc. With portrait, 8vo» ne/, $2.00. (By mail. ?2.20) 

In hiB latest work, Mr. McCabe briugs to bear the same thoroughuess of research, the same vipror and reasoning, and the same 
attractive style that characterizes the *' Abolard *' volume. His point of view is not that of eulogist or of the religious disputant. Rather 
his aim is that expressed by the title to present a picture of the man, Augustine, and the time in which he lived. 



The Egregious English 

By ANGUS McNEILL. I2mo, uniform with Crosland's 
" Unspeakahle Soot," net, ?1.25. (By mail, $1.35). 
Mr. McNeill's book is a vigorous and amusing na- 
tional counter thrust to *' The Unspeakable Scot.** 



The American Republic and Its Government 

By JAMES ALBERT WOODBURN, Professor of American History and Pol- 
itics, Indiana University. Svo. 

An analysis of the government of the United States with a consideration of 
its fundamental principles and of its relations to the states and territories.

of '* History of Yiddish Literature," "Songs from the Ghetto," etc. In two parts. Each complete in itself and indexed. Parti. 

From Earliest Times to the Close of the Eighteenth Century. (Ready.). Part II. The Nineteenth Century. (Ready in March.)

Referring to Part I, T/ie London itjocff A:er said : "We wish to give a hearty welcome to this meritorious and carefully prepared 
work of Prof. Wiener. It will enable an ordinary reader to get a considerable idea of what the Russians have done in literature. . . . 
We shall look forward with pleasant anticipations to the coming volume." 



Mediaeval India Under Mohammedan Rule 

By STANLEY LANE-POOLE. No. G5 in "The Story of the 
Nations." 12mo. Fully illustrated. TVe/, $1.35. Half leather, 
net, $1.60. (Postage 15c.) 

The history of Mohammedan conquest always reads like 
romance. After the Muslim tide was checked in the West, it 
turned upon India ; and for six centuries the Hindus submitted to 
Mohammedan kings. How the conquest was accomplished, and 
how the will of a small, fanatical minority was imposed upon the 
Hindu millions, form the subject of this book.

A Revised and Enlarged Edition of "7,000 Words Often Mispro- 
nounced," with a Supplement of 3,000 Additional Words. A

EXTRACT PROM PREPACB 
*'It may be thought that the publication of these two TolumeB is 
superfluous after the two works, * Auld Lang Syne,' and the ' Auto- 
biography,* written by Max Miiller himself. But it seemed that 
something more was wanted to show the innermost character of the 
real man ; for ' Auld Lang Syne * gave recollections of his friends 
only, ^ a small portion of the panorama of life that passed before ' 
his eyes; and the 'Autobiography' is but a fragment, bringing us 
little beyond the threshold of his career. The plan pursued through- 
out these volumes has been to let Max Miiller's letters and the 
testimony of friends to bis mind and character speak for themselves, 
whilst the whole is connected by a slight thread of necessary 
narrative." 

The River War 

An Historical Account of the Reconquest of the Soudan. 
By Winston Spencer Chukchill, M.P. Edited by

etc. 8vo. $4.50 net; by mail, $4.64. 

*' Is it possible to get at a working hypothesis as to the cause of 
laughter, — to be able to explain, that is, in terms however vague 
and general, the nature of the mainspring which excites a manifes- 
tation of human emotion, sometimes pleasant, sometimes con- 
temptuous, sometimes triumphant, sometimes fiendish? No more 
thorough answer — though perhaps no complete answer will ever 
be given — to that question has yet been published than that of 
Professor Jamea Sully . . . not the first writer, of course, to 
propound a 'theory of laughter,' but he is perhaps the first, so far 
as we are concerned, to give us something near a satisfying proposi- 
tion." — The Spectator (London).

Wood-Mabtin, M.R.I.A., author of "The Lake Dwell- 
ings of Ireland," etc. Two volumes. 8vo. $12.00. 
" Judged as an uncritical collection of material upon Irish folk- 
lore, it is both of value and interest. It represents a long labor of 
compilation, and the bibliography alone (comprising over nine hun- 
dred entries) would merit grateful recognition. . . . His work 
thus furnishes a valuable supplement to the older Irish writings."

This new translation of "The Characters of Theophrastus" is 
intended not for the narrow circle of classical philologists, but for 
the larger body of cultivated persons who have an interest in the 
past. The fact that the three prior translations of this book are now 
out of print seems to justify the preparation of the present work.

LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS. 



It was twenty years ago that the first at- 
tempts were made in this country to bring 
about a more intimate relation than had before 
existed between the work of the public library 
and the public school. Dr. Poole of Chicago 
and Dr. Green of Worcester were the pioneer 
experimenters in this field, and they made a 
special effort to attract to the library classes 
of students from the higher grades of the 
schools, providing for them special collections 
of books, temporarily set apart for their inspec- 
tion, and entertaining them with informal 
talks about the proper use of libraries. From 
this modest beginning has sprung, as all who 
have followed the history of the library move- 
ment are aware, a development of complicated 
and helpful activities on the part of librarians, 
having for their general purpose the correla- 
tion of school and library work, and now 
occupying an important place in the modern 
conception of the librarian's function. The 
public library of to-day has a children's de- 
partment as a matter of course, and makes it 
a pleasant place for children to resort to, pro- 
viding for them both books and pictures, with 
the accompaniment of sympathetic and kindly 
counsel. The same library is alert to follow 
the school course of study, to set apart the 
books most useful in its pursuit, to prepare 
special bulletins and annotated lists for teach- 
ers and pupils, to offer opportunities for the 
assembling of classes, to encourage groups of 
teachers bent upon professional culture, and 
to facilitate in many other ways the extension 
of library privileges to those who are engaged 
in the work of the schools. 

During the earlier phase of this development 
the essential purpose seems to have been the 
attraction of teachers and students to the 
library. During recent years the work has 
taken on a new phase, having for its controll- 
ing idea the bringing of the library to the 
school. This is a logical outcome of what has 
been learned in most large cities from the 
establishment of branch libraries and the de- 
velopment of a special delivery service. The 
most successful public library system is the 
one which is not content with the mere opening 



74 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



of its doors and the welcoming of those who 
enter, but undertakes the more active work of 
bringing its books into every neighborhood, 
and almost into every home. The special 
lesson of this experience for educational work 
is being taken to heart in many progressive 
communities, where the library is now being 
brought into the school instead of standing 
apart and waiting for the school to seek it out. 
The way of accomplishing this purpose is to 
grant exceptional privileges to students and 
school officers, to permit books to be taken in 
larger numbers and kept for longer periods 
than are allowed the general public. Under 
this system, for example, a teacher of some 
subject may be permitted to draw a collection 
of fifty books at a time, and keep them for a 
whole term, thus incalculably enriching the 
work done by his class, and giving to every 
student of the subject an opportunity to sup- 
plement his own single text-book with a suc- 
cession of others. A second plan, which is 
particularly commendable for large cities hav- 
ing many large schools, is that of setting apart 
one room in each school as a special delivery 
station, or even as a branch library, with its 
own well-selected supply of reference books 
and its own special attendant. We anticipate 
important results from the development of this 
idea, which would doubtless be put widely into 
practice if it were not for the expense involved 
and the question of service. 

This difficulty appears to be twofold : there 
is the question of expense, absolutely con- 
sidered, and there is the question as to who 
should bear it. In our large cities, the library 
board and the school board are usually distinct 
bodies of coordinate powers. There is thus a 
tendency for each of them to desire to shift 
upon the shoulders of the other the burden of 
any work done for their helpful correlation. 
The school trustees will object to providing 
space and heat and light for library purposes, 
and the library trustees will as naturally object 
to paying the wages of an attendant who would 
be to all intents and purposes a member of the 
school staff. This is a real difficulty, but it 
should not prove insuperable. As far as the 
question of absolute expense goes, the only 
thing to say is that it must be met by the 
public in some way if the thing is really worth 
doing educationally. As President Eliot re- 
minds us now and then, the public is only just 
beginning to realize its responsibilities in the 
matter of education, and our present expendi- 
ture, although it seems liberal in comparison 



with the expenditure of a generation ago, will 
in the not far distant future be seen to have 
been niggardly in comparison with what will 
then be regarded as both legitimate and 
necessary. 

It is of course true that the sort of educa- 
tional stimulus that we are now considering — 
the stimulus that comes from the large use of 
books by both teachers and students — may be 
gained by having the books permanently in the 
schools, and belonging to them, instead of tem- 
porarily, and belonging to the general public col- 
lection. While the time is never likely to come 
when the public library will not be a useful 
adjunct to the work of the schools, the time is 
already at hand when the school will be in large 
measure independent of outside sources of 
supply. The school library — not viewed as a 
miscellaneous collection of books for reading, 
but as a carefully selected outfit of tools for 
teaching purposes - — already exists in many 
places, and will soon be found in many more. 
This library does not seek to include as many 
titles as possible ; it seeks rather to include an 
adequate supply of the books that are most 
needed, the number of which need not be very 
great. It is a library in which all the mem- 
bers of a class may be using the same work at 
the same time, because a sufficient number of 
copies are at hand. It is a library plentifully 
supplied with such reprints as the " Old South 
Leaflets " and such inexpensive reproductions 
of standard literature as may be found in more 
than one popular paper-covered series. It is 
a library which has for its counterpart in the 
same school the scientific laboratory, with its 
multiplication of microscopes, and balances, 
and galvanometers. 

This last suggestion is the one that most 
needs to be used, because it provides the clear- 
est argument for what is going to be the next 
great step in school equipment. It is all very 
well to talk about the teacher as being the sum 
total of the school, but the most zealous and 
inspired of teachers cannot do the work of 
modern education without the aid of a great 
many material accessories. In the matter of 
this material equipment, our schools do very 
well upon what may be called the showy side ; 
they are apt to have elaborate buildings, and 
amply- equipped gymnasiums, assembly-halls, 
and playgrounds. But the internal equipment 
often lags far behind, although it is the most 
important of all. The department of science 
has, indeed, for the most part made its fight 
and won its victory. A generation ago, it cost 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



76 



something of a struggle to get a few hundred 
dollars expended for scientific apparatus and 
material, even for a school that might have cost 
a hundred thousand dollars or more. Now our 
good high schools have their scientific labora- 
tories as a matter of course, and the appropria- 
tion for their maintenance has become a matter 
of unquestioned routine. But today it costs the 
same effort to get a few hundred dollars' worth 
of books that it formerly cost to get a meagre 
supply of apparatus and chemicals. The depart- 
ments of history and literature still have to beg 
for their laboratories as the scientific depart- 
ments had to beg for theirs thirty years ago. 
It is not yet recognized that the library of a 
school is the laboratory for all those studies 
which we call the humanities, and is entitled 
to the same liberal provision. It should be 
made a matter of principle that in every school 
of the higher grade as much money should be 
spent annually upon library material as upon 
material for the scientific laboratories, and 
until this principle is universally recognized 
and acted upon, the teaching of the most im- 
portant group of subjects in any school will be 
at a disadvantage. In the development of 
school equipment this is the next important 
step to be taken, and there is no good reason 
to doubt that the coming generation will find 
the parity practically accomplished. As long 
as the present disparity of equipment exists, the 
historical and literary interests of our public 
school system will have a right to complain of 
unfair treatment. Meanwhile, to recur to the 
subject with which the present discussion start- 
ed out, much may be done during this period 
of internal school development by an intelli- 
gent cooperation between the existing resources 
of the two coordinate systems of the public 
school and the public library. 



MODERN LIBRARY ENTERPRISES. 



The most important characteristics of the library 
work of the past two years are the inauguration 
and enlargement of plans which will tend to more 
effective cooperation in actual work and to make the 
treasures stored up in our larger libraries available 
to students throughout the country. The coopera- 
tion between libraries during the quarter of a cen- 
tury previous has been largely that of laying the 
foundation which has made larger plans possible, 
and it is interesting to note how step by step the 
way has been prepared for the more extensive en- 
terprises of the present. 

In the early days, the days of small things, the 
attention of the librarian was largely directed to 



consideration of practical questions of housing, 
arranging, shelving, and caring for books ; to de- 
veloping methods of classification, cataloguing, and 
accounting ; and to regulations and conveniences 
for readers. The first steps towards cooperation 
consisted of an interchange of views at the meet- 
ings of the library associations and elsewhere, of a 
comparison of experiments and experiences, and 
of placing freely at the service of all any improve- 
ments or advances in methods and appliances. 
This interchange of views was of great value both 
in promoting a more efficient organization of libra- 
ries, and in securing a degree of uniformity of 
methods and materials without which further coop- 
eration would have been difficult. 

The first organized cooperative work was in the 
direction of supplying the indexes, catalogues, and 
manuals which are the necessary pathfinders for 
the investigator and student, and the tools of the 
library worker. Most important among the earlier 
publications of this sort were Poole's " Index to 
Periodical Literature " and the Report of the 
Commissioner of Education on American libraries, 
1876 ; the first embodying the work of a large 
number of leading libraries, and the second con- 
taining contributions from leading librarians. 

The American Library Association, organized 
in 1876, has been of great service to library work. 
It includes in its membership representatives of 
libraries in all parts of the United States. There 
have also been organized, mostly within a few 
years past, twenty-two state associations affiliated 
with the national organization. The Association 
has accomplished much through its committee on 
cooperation and its Publishing Board. The latter 
has issued a valuable series of 8p>ecial bibliographies, 
the latest and most important being the annotated 
list of books on American history, the expense of 
which has been borne by Mr. George lies. A 
valuable feature of the bibliographies of the Asso- 
ciation is the annotation, giving critical estimates 
of the books included. A cooperative list of chil- 
dren's books is now in preparation under the 
auspices of the Association, which will represent 
in its selection a consensus of the opinion of chil- 
dren's librarians throughont the country. Valuable 
series of catalogue cards of important serials are 
being published by the Association, the copy being 
furnished by some of the larger libraries. The 
gift of SIOO.OOO from Mr. Carnegie, which was 
announced at the last meeting, renders possible 
much additional work of great value, including, 
probably, the publication of a list of portraits and 
of various reference books which have long been 
projected. 

By far the most important cooperative library 
work, and one which will, to a large extent, make 
all similar work unnecessary, is the printing and 
distribution of the catalogue cards of the Library 
of Congress. The reasons for undertaking this 
great enterprise, and the methods adopted for 
carrying it oat, are clearly stated by the Librarian 



76 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1 



of Congress in a •' Handbook of Card Distribution," 
bearing date of August, 1901. Briefly they are 
as follows : 

The catalogues of most American libraries, in- 
deed of all of any importance, are in card form. 
These cards, so familiar to most library users, are of 
bristol board and approximately the size of the 
smaller postal cards formerly in use. With a very 
few exceptions all the libraries in America use cat- 
alogue cards of the same size, this uniformity being 
one of the invaluable results of the earnest labors of 
the library pioneers, some of whom are still among 
our active librarians and are building upon the 
foundations so wisely laid. Catalogue cards are 
either written or typewritten, or, in the case of a 
very few of the largest libraries, are printed. Each 
book has a separate card for the author, the subject, 
and for the title if noteworthy. Some books may 
have fifty separate subject cards, some only one ; 
the average is perhaps five. The preparation of 
such a catalogue requires the services of an educated 
expert, of extensive knowledge and good judgment, 
to determine and state accurately the subjects treat- 
ed, and of a copyist to do the work of writing. This 
work each American library has heretofore been 
doing for itself, at great expense. As already noted, 
something had been done in the way of cooperation 
in this direction, but no comprehensive plan could 
be adopted or carried out from the lack of a central 
bureau adequately equipped for the special purpose 
in hand. This central bureau the Library of Con- 
gress proposes to establish. While the immediate 
purpose of printing the cards is for its own use, it 
offers to furnish the cards as printed to all Ameri- 
can libraries at the cost of production, which, it is 
needless to say, is an insignificant fraction of the 
cost of producing them separately in each library. 

The advantages offered by the Library of Con- 
gress for this work are very great. It has the 
largest collection of books in the Western Hem- 
isphere, and is growing more rapidly than any 
other library. Of every copyrighted book issued in 
this country it receives free two copies, — usually 
before the date of publication and in advance of 
other libraries, thus permitting the prompt printing 
of the cards. It receives a large amount of ma- 
terial in exchange for its own publications, and is 
at all times buying largely both current and non- 
current works, thus acquiring a large portion of 
the material acquired by other libraries. It has a 
modern printing plant, and an expert cataloguing 
force, and is equipped to produce a catalogue which 
shall embody the best cataloguing methods, and 
shall be so comprehensive as to meet most of the 
needs of other libraries throughout the country. 
An ingenious and elaborate scheme of distribution 
has been devised which insures the prompt delivery 
to all subscribing libraries. Libraries are permitted 
to subscribe for all cards issued, for cards covering 
any particular classes or subjects, or for cards for 
individual books. In addition to those sold to sub- 
scribers, a limited number of sets of the printed 



catalogue cards are deposited with certain libraries 
situated in various convenient parts of the country. 
These deposits are for the purpose of enabling 
students to ascertain whether works desired for 
reference are in the Library of Congress ; to pro- 
mote bibliographical work and uniformity in cata- 
loguing ; and to enable the depository and other 
libraries in the vicinity readily to order the cards 
for their own catalogues. The deposits are required 
to be arranged alphabetically in suitable cases, and 
made easily accessible to the public. 

The distribution and use of this great catalogue 
will, in addition to its other advantages, do much 
to promote another important work of mutual help- 
fulness among librarians, — that of inter-library 
loans. The idea of loaning books to other libraries, 
even to those at a considerable distance, is not a 
new one. The most important work of this kind 
has been that done in connection with the Library 
of the Surgeon General at Washington. This valu- 
able collection of books, consisting of 135,000 vol- 
umes, has been practically at the service of the 
medical profession throughout the country for many 
years. In the course of an address at the meet- 
ing of the American Library Association in 1901 
the Librarian of Congress described this work as 
follows : 

"The library of the Surgeon General's office — the most 
comprehensive in the world within its special field — sends 
its books to members of the medical profession throughout 
the United States, relieving just so much the burden upon 
local libraries ; and it has issued a catalogue which is not 
merely in form and method efficient, but is so nearly an ex- 
hibit of the entire literature of the medical sciences that it 
renders unnecessary duplication of cataloguing and analytical 
work within the field which it covers. This catalogue has 
conferred a general benefit not equalled by any bibliographic 
work within any other department of literature. It is per- 
haps the most eminent bibliographic work yet accomplished 
by any government. The cost of its mere publication, 
which is the cost chargeable to the general benefit, has al- 
ready exceeded $250,000." 

The Librarian of Congress cited this as a valuable 
precedent for the same extension of the field of 
usefulness of the Congressional Library and of the 
other Government libraries. The Library of Con- 
gress has since adopted the plan of loaning books 
to other libraries, and is practically placing its val- 
uable collection at the service of the student and 
investigator in any part of the country. The con- 
ditions of these loans are stated by the Librarian 
of Congress in an address before the American His- 
torical Association in December, 1901. 

"If the book is in the National Library,if itisa'book which 
it is not the duty of the local library to supply ; if it is not at 
the moment needed in Washington, and if it is transportable : 
it may, very probably, upon application, be lent to the local 
library for its use. . . To justify the issue beyond the limits 
of Washington of a rare book, or a book important for refer- 
ence use and not a duplicate, there must be a somewhat ex- 
traordinary need. It must be on the part, not of ordinary 
readers, not of a student whose purpose is merely self- 
improvement, but of an investigator whose use of the book 
will tend to advance the general knowledge." 

A similar plan of mutual-accommodation by loans 
has prevailed among large libraries to a moderate 
but gradually increasing extent for years, and the 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



77 



courresy has frequently been extended by some of 
the larger libraries to smaller ones whose collections 
were not sofBcient to enable them to reciprocate in 
any way. In his report for 1899-1900 the libra- 
rian of Harvard UniTersity speaks as follows : 

" The usual nnmber of applications from other libraries, 
eBpeesally college libraries, and from scholars in different 
paits of the coontry, hare been reeeiTed, asd the library has 
keaa aUe to send avaj 475 Tolnmes in response to these re- 
^MlMs. This nnmber is somevhat larger than in any preTions 
Tear, bnt no instanoe of loes or injary has occarred. and it is 
IImiiIiI that the convenienoe of ooUese officerB^and of other 
■ahalan in Cambridg« has not beaa mterfered with by the 
tamporary withdrawal of theaa Tohnaes." 
The last annaal report of the Boston Public Li- 
brary notes the loan of 461 volumes to libraries 
out«ide the city, and similar work is reported by 
other large libraries. 

While the nnmber of inter-library loans has 
greatly increased daring the past year, and is likely 
to increase as it becomes more widely known that 
such privileges may be had, still they will probably 
always form an inconsiderable item of the work of 
our libraries. The plan, however, affords a farther 
possibility of great saving to oar libraries. If, as 
was point«d out several years ago by the librarian 
of Princeton University, a systematic plan could be 
adopted, preferably under the direction and leader- 
ship of the Library of Congress, by which the eon- 
tents of our great libraries, particularly the valu- 
able sets of periodicals and collections of books on 
special subjects, might be made more generally 
available, a great saving of expenditure in unnec- 
essary duplication might be effected. Most of oar 
larger libraries have collections of great value upon 
s{>ecial subjects, such for instance as the Avery 
architectural collection at Columbia, or the Riant 
collection at Harvard. These are unique and can 
not be duplicated. By the distribution of catalogaes 
and a generous system of inter-library loans these 
collections may be pat largely at the service of sta- 
dents in all parts of the country. 

The prospects for developing the sporadic and 
somewhat informal work already being done in 
inter-library loans into a comprehensive and effect- 
ive system, also under the leadership of the Library 
of Congress, seems very bright. I stat« one of 
the plans of the Librarian of Congress in his own 
words, quoting again from his address before the 
American Historical Association : 

" The Library is endeavoring to aeqnire. not merely the 
most complete collection io the United States of books abont 
books, bat also the fullest information as to what books 
exist in particnlar collections other than its own. It is 
aoenmnlating this in the catalogaes of other libraries in book 
form and also in card form. It is receiving a copy of every 
eatalogne card printed by the Harvard, the Boston, the New 
York, the John Crerar Library ; and it hopes to receive 
in print or in manuscript cards covering significant material 
IB other collections important to research. It will form thoan 
into a great card cat&logne of Americaii collections ontaide 
of Washington. It may thus add to its efficiency as a bnraan 
of information by advising the inqairer, not merely what 
literature exists on a given subject, but where the particalar 
book he needs may most conveniently be found." 
It is not an altogether improbable dream that 



the time will come when the student in any part of 
the country may have from any collection, how- 
ever remote, the free use at his own fireside of any 
book which he may need for an important and 
worthy parpoee. William Howard Brett. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE RHYTHMIC PAUSE IN VKESK. 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 
May I have a bit of space to enter a brief apologia 
for some of my own verse recently critieised in your cfAr- 
umns. I am duly appreciative of the kind things yonr 
critic said of my verses, bat there is one little point I 
would like to clear up, as much for the cause of verse- 
making in general as on my own account. 

I am indicted for an " incurably defective ear " or 
an " inexcusable carelessness." To either imputation I 
plead " not g^ty," so please the Court. The charge is 
gathered from the last line in these : 

" Till chastened love. 

Freed frooi the eloegioK dross of eartUy p— iiw. 

Leap a akoodaK flame upward to Heaven." 
My critic kindly avers that " it would have been so eaaj 
to write : 

* Leap like a shooting flame npward to Heaven.' " 
It would have been easy, bnt I didn't; and I am not 
now convinced of the value of the proposed amendment. 
The rhythm of a verse is not marred by the lack of a 
syllable, provided the interval of its absence is a nat- 
nral pause or rest. I need not refer my critic to 
Sidney Lanier's " Science of English Verse," wherein 
the rhythmic pause or rest in verse is carefully and sat- 
isfactorily exponnded. After the word " Leap " in the 
line tub Ule, there is a natural rest or pause of the 
voice, which fills the rhythmical necessity of the first 
measnre or foot. I assume of coarse that verse is 
addressed primarily to the ear. I even presume to 
think that my line without the " easy " amendment of 
the syllable "like," is stronger and more organic. 
Perhaps the many " similarly defective lines," which 
my critic imputes to me, may be found to come 
nnder the same rhythmic law. My interest in seeking 
to justify my verse in this regard is not merely per- 
sonal, bnt looks towards the vindication of the art of 
verse-making in general. Verse is too often subjected 
to the Umitations of the older criticism, which rigor-

RICKETSON'S SKETCH OF THOREAD. 
I To the Editor of Thb Diai..} 

In a review of " Daniel Ricketson and his Friends," 
in your last issue, reference was made by me to Mr. 
Ricketson's pencil-sketch of Tboreau as containing 
"sufficient hint of the cartoonist to intensify bnt not 
degrade the humor." At the request of the editors of 
the volume, I would say that there was no idea of car- 
icature or cartoon in the mind of Mr. Ricketson, but 
that the sketch was regarded as a serious likeness of 
Thoreau and the only full-length study of his physique. 
The lack of skill in drawing, however, has given an as- 
pect of unconscious drollery to the portrait.

A Time-Serving Statesman.* 



No life of Harley having ever been pub- 
lished, though Swift intended to write one, 
Mr. Roscoe has rendered history a service by 
giving a concise and impartial account of the 
man and his political career. A consider- 
able portion of the Harley Papers, consisting 
mainly of letters to and from Lord Harley, 
has lately been published by the Historical 
Manuscripts Commission ; and it is mainly 
from these papers, and from other manuscript 
sources, that the biographer has taken the ma- 
terial for his book. 

Born in 1661, the son of Sir Edward Harley 
of Herefordshire, Robert Harley early devel- 
oped a talent for politics, and was elected to 
the first parliament of William and Mary. He 
showed his interest, but not his skill, in finance 
by starting the ill-fated National Land Bank 
in 1696, and later was one of the incorpo- 
rators of the still more disastrously unlucky 
South Sea Company. His knowledge of par- 
liamentary law, a study but little pursued at 
that time, procured him the speakership of the 
House of Commons in three successive parlia- 
ments. In 1704 he was appointed secretary of 
state for the northern department, still retain- 
ing his speakership — a practice now unheard 
of — until the dissolution of parliament in 
the following year. Entering public life as a 
Whig and a dissenter, self-interest had gradu- 
ally transformed him into a Tory and a sup- 
porter of the established church, though he 
attempted the impossible in posing as cham- 
pion of both parties at the same time. Friction 
with his Whig chief, Godolphin, led to his re- 
tiring from the cabinet in 1708. Two years 
later a turn in the tide of popular favor en- 
abled Queen Anne to restore him to her coun- 
cils in the capacity of lord chamberlain, then 
chancellor of the exchequer, and, soon after, 
lord high treasurer. As her most trusted 
adviser he became virtually prime minister, 
though the term was then a new one. A fur- 
ther proof of royal favor was his accession to 
the peerage as Baron Harley, Earl of Oxford, 
and Earl Mortimer. The double earldom our 
author passes without comment, but a prob- 
able explanation is not far to seek. Aubrey 
de Vere, twentieth earl of Oxford, had died

only nine years before, and the fear legt some 
less remote descendant of the family should 
appear to claim the lapsed title would seem to 
have caused the bestowal of an additional earl- 
dom upon the new peer. 

The War of the Spanish Succession was 
dragging out its weary length, and Harley 
sided actively with the peace party and against 
Marlborough and his faction. Meeting with 
opposition in the Lords, he persuaded the 
queen to dismiss Marlborough from her service 
and to create twelve new peers in favor of 
peace ; and thus the desired cessation of hos- 
tilities was attained, the treaty of Utrecht, 
two years later, crowning this stroke of state- 
craft. Forfeiting, we know not how, the good 
will of Lady Masham, the queen's favorite, 
Harley was dismissed from office in 1714. 
Some of the reasons alleged strike one as 
amusingly feminine. It was charged against 
him that he neglected all business ; that he 
was seldom to be understood ; that when he 
did explain himself he could not be depended 
upon ; that he never came to the queen at the 
time appointed, and when he did come he often 
came drunk ; and finally, to crown all, that he 
behaved toward her with bad manners, inde- 
cency, and disrespect. The queen died a few 
days later, and though Harley spoke several 
times after this in parliament he soon retired 
to pursue his favorite avocation as a collector 
of books and manuscripts, and to enjoy the 
society of men of letters. But ere a year had 
passed his retirement was rudely broken in 
upon by his arrest on the charge of high 
treason, and he exchanged his voluntary seclu- 
sion for a forced one of twelve months in the 
Tower. Here he seems to have called litera- 
ture to his aid and to have passed the time in 
comparative cheerfulness. He was suspected 
of having secretly negotiated for the restora- 
tion of the Stuarts, and was also charged with 
having exerted an improper influence over the 
late queen. But his impeachment came to 
nothing, as the two houses disagreed upon 
methods of procedure, and he was acquitted 
by the Lords, his prosecutors failing to appear. 
He died in 1724. 

As to Harley's character, he has been 
branded by some of his contemporaries as the 
blackest of knaves, and extolled by others as 
a paragon of virtue. Probably his worst fail- 
ings were irresolution and insincerity. In an 
age of corruption among public servants he 
was comparatively blameless ; but he was an 
opportunist in politics, and, striving to win

and retain the favor of two opposite factions, 
he met the fate to be expected by one who 
tries to ride two horses going in contrary di- 
rections. He is entitled to our gratitude for 
the fine collection of manuscripts which, gath- 
ered at great expense, and added to by his 
son, finally came into the possession of the 
British Museum and so became accessible to 
the public. As to his own contributions to 
literature, Macaulay calls his verse " more 
execrable than the bellman's "; but Swift says 
of his state papers that " no man had more 
proper thoughts, or put them in so strong and 
clear a light." His intercourse with and pat- 
ronage of Swift and De Foe greatly increase 
one's interest in him. He was the first to 
press the journalist into the service of politics, 
and to make the press a powerful factor in the 
attainment of political ends. De Foe's fertile 
brain was to Harley an inexhaustible mine of 
ingenious expedients, and the facile pen of the 
author of " Robinson Crusoe " was at his 
patron's service as long as such service prom- 
ised an adequate remuneration. The always 
impecunious hack was not bashful in his calls 
for money. His eulogy of his benefactor seems 
to have been dictated by that species of grati- 
tude which consists in a lively sense of benefits 
to come ; and when the fountain of such favors 
ran dry he took to himself no shame for turn- 
ing, until its waters again began to play, to a 
patron of the opposite party. It was in con- 
nection with the union of Scotland and En- 
gland that he rendered Harley the greatest 
service, travelling from place to place "with 
tireless energy, and writing meantime for the 
press a series of articles to promote the union. 
In a letter to his chief he summarizes, with 
characteristic clearness and brevity, the objects 
of his northern mission. 

" I beg leave, though it be beginning at the wrong 
end, to set down how I understand my present business, 
as follows : — 

'"1. To inform myself of the measures taking, or 
parties forming, against the Union, and apply myself 
to prevent them. 

" ' 2. In conversation and by all reasonable methods 
to dispose people's minds to the Union. 

" ' 3. By writing or discourse, to answer any objec- 
tions, libels, or reflections on the Union, the English, or 
the Court, relating to the Union. 

"'4. To remove the jealousies and uneasiness of 
people about secret designs here against the Kirk.' " 

The letter closes with the customary petition 
for pecuniary aid. 

As it is far pleasanter, as well as more 
charitable, to think well of a man than other- 
wise, let us close with a few sentences upon 



Harley from Swift's " Inquiry into the Be- 
haviour of the Queen's Last Ministry." The 
writer's language is in general laudatory, 
although not entirely free from self-contradic- 
tion. 

" He was utterly a stranger to fear ; and eonse- 
qnently had a presence of mind upon all emergeneies. 
His liberality and contempt of money were such that 
he almost ruined his estate while he was in employ- 
ment; yet his avarice for the public was so great that 
it neither consisted with the present corruptions of the 
age nor the circumstances of the time. . . . He was 
affable and courteous, extremely easy and agreeable in 
conversation, and altogether disengaged ; regular in 
his life, with great appearance of piety; nor ever guilty 
of any expressions that could possibly tend to what was 
indecent or profane. His imperfections were at leaat 
as obvious, aJthough not so nnmerous, as his virtues. 
He had an air of secrecy in his manner and counte- 
nance, by no means proper for a great Minister, be- 
cause it warns all men to prepare against it. He often 
gave no answer at all, and very seldom a direct one. 
... I remember he was likewise heavily charged with 
the common court vice, of promising very liberally and 
seldom performing; of which, although I cannot alto- 
gether acquit him, yet I am confident his intentions 
were generally better than his disappointed solicitors 
would believe." 

Portraits, appendices, footnotes, and index 
add to the value of this scholarly study, whose 
moderate compass is not the least of its merits.

MoDERx Spiritualism.* 



The story of modern Spiritualism is not only 
one of the most interesting, but also a deeply 
significant portion of the intellectual history of 
the nineteenth century. It is a source of grati- 
fication that this movement has at length found 
so able and so appreciative an historian as Mr. 
Podmore. The qualities required for survey- 
ing a movement of this kind are many and rare 
to find in one individual. There is needed a 
patience that will take endless trouble to ascer- 
tain the facts, to draw distinctions between the 
various men and the various movements that 
together form so composite an aggregate ; there 
is needed a critical grasp to distinguish that 
which is important from that which is merely 
subsidiary; and perhaps more fundamental 
than either, the capacity to interpret from a 
modern scientific standpoint the true inward- 
ness of the phenomena that are recorded. 

Although modern Spiritualism is commonly 
supposed to have be^nn about 1848. one is pre-

pared to find that the forms of manifestations 
which then brought the movement into promi- 
nence have many and complex historical ante- 
cedents. Mr. Podmore has no difficulty in 
tracing the close relation between modern 
Spiritualism and certain peculiar phenomena 
which at all times have found a place in human 
culture. The mediaeval tales of possession and 
witchcraft suggest the existence at that time of 
unusual individuals who in peculiar and some- 
what morbid mental states were apt to exhibit 
manifestations suggesting a spirit origin. Still 
more pertinent is the fact that at all periods the 
occurrence of mysterious knocks and rappings 
is recorded, likewise in the presence of such 
nervously constituted persons ; these form a 
common factor in the transcendental procedures 
recounted in the history of the occult, are, in- 
deed, a direct legacy from the witchcraft of the 
middle ages. The German name for them — 
Poltergeist — has come to be accepted as the 
best generic term to describe the fact with- 
out implying a theory. Such poltergeist rap- 
pings have frequently been heard, and often by 
persons of deeply religious belief; the readiness 
to receive communication from the spirit land 
has transformed such rappings into messages 
and then into miracles. The family of John 
Wesley (in 1717) furnishes an illustration 
closely similar to that which appeared in the 
Fox family in 1848. 

Another and very significant root of modern 
Spiritualism finds its way back into ancient 
times, but culminates particularly in the ap- 
pearance of Mesmer and the Mesmerists who 
followed in the train of his teaching and his 
success. They contributed a theoretical factor 
by suggesting the possibility of peculiar forces 
with which some individuals might be sur- 
rounded, and by means of which they could 
transcend the normal sense-powers of mankind, 
see things at a distance, foretell the future, 
prescribe for ills, and in other ways be re- 
leased from the limitations of sense. Almost 
all of the feats which in later days the spiritu- 
alistic mediums performed — excepting the 
physical manifestations — can be traced back 
to the complex series of movements that fol- 
lowed the appearance of Mesmer. 

" For geDerations the two streams of superstition 
have pursued a parallel course without meeting. The 
learned had believed in their fluids, the vulgar in their 
Poltergeists ; but whilst the magnetic sorauambule had 
for the most part eschewed physical phenomena, the 
naughty children had found the seeing of visions and 
trance-speaking too tame to satisfy their ambitions." 

Still another source of the spiritualistic doc- 



trines comes from the religious side, and finds 
analogy in the beliefs of Swedenborg and his 
followers ; and finally, scattered elements which 
were absorbed by the spiritualists are to be 
found in the somewhat extravagant doctrines 
regarding the constitution of the world, its 
properties and destiny, which unorthodox in- 
dividuals have at all times been ready to set 
forth. 

It thus appears that modern Spiritualism is 
by no means an isolated phenomenon. There 
were spiritualists before the Rochester knock- 
ings, and one of these in particular, Andrew 
Jackson Davis, was directly influential in 
bringing about a spiritualistic interpretation 
of the mysterious rappings. " The raps and 
movements of tables did not, in the ultimate 
analysis, originate anything ; they served merely 
to confirm a pre-existing belief." But it was 
unquestionably through the displacement of 
the knees and toes of some naughty children, 
that modern Spiritualism, which is in essence 
American Spiritualism, finds its starting point. 
There is no need of detailing the checkered 
career of those who thus originated a charac- 
teristic contribution to American life. From 
the very outset, the mediums' methods were 
frequently exposed, and the exposure as fre- 
quently had little effect upon popular belief ; 
while the very tardy confession of the Fox 
sisters was made under circumstances that de- 
prived it of some of its evidential value. Many 
others were ready at once to add to the simple 
phenomena exhibited at Rochester ; and the 
growth of the spiritualistic equipment in the 
way of manifestations was decided and inter- 
esting. The physical manifestations developed 
from the rappings to the movement of heavy 
objects without contact, and the mysterious 
introduction of all sorts of trifles, apparently 
as the gift of the gods ; then later and espe- 
cially in England, to the moving of tables 
apparently by their own will, and by such 
movements to the spelling out of messages ; 
to spirit writing and speaking through an 
entranced medium ; to the various forms of 
slate writing, spirit photography, materializa- 
tion of the actual forms of the departed, the 
transcendence of the physical laws, as by levi- 
tation or elongation of the medium himself ; 
to the mysterious release of the medium from 
knots and cords, and an array of similar 
" cabinet " performances. 

This American movement found its way to 
England and added to the particular forms of 
Spiritualism which were there already current.

England reacted to the epidemic in a different 
and very characteristic way ; it was a " pale 
reflection " of the American propagandum. 
One of the peculiar English contributions was 
that of the combination of phrenology with 
Mesmerism, which was in turn incorporated 
with spiritualistic manifestations. Then, again, 
while in America the public performances by 
paid mediums were the rule, it was rather the 
private mediums by whose influence the move- 
ment grew in England. It also expanded 
very much more slowly, and probably would 
never have attained any great notoriety with- 
out the direct stimulus of the American me- 
diums. From this period of widest popularity. 
Spiritualism has in recent decades declined, 
and indeed changed its form. It became easy 
to perceive, as the years went by, a change of 
emphasis from the physical manifestation to 
the spiritual messages, so that, during the 
decline, less and less attention was paid to 
these trick-like performances of mediums, and 
more and more was the evidence for the spir- 
itualistic belief based upon utterances spoken 
in trance, or written down automatically by 
the " control " of the medium. That at va- 
rious times, including the most recent, eminent 
persons have given their adherence, not only 
to the genuineness of some of the physical 
phenomena, but likewise to the theoretical 
explanations offered, is a matter of common 
knowledge. The interest in Spiritualism, while 
now decidly a small part, when measured by 
numerical representatives, of what it was a few 
decades ago, cannot be said to have really dis- 
appeared. There have always been many who 
have felt the possibility of some residual phe- 
nomena not explicable by ordinary laws, which 
in a way give some ground for a belief in the 
supernatural and which possibly demand a 
spiritual explanation. Mr. Podmore himself 
records the experiences with Mrs. Piper as 
among those suggesting such an unaccounted 
residuum. 

Such, in brief, is the story which Mr. Pod- 
more tells with great accuracy of detail, with 
great clearness of exposition, in his two notable 
volumes. But the work is not merely a his- 
tory ; it is a criticism. And the critic's func- 
tion is quite as important as the historian's. 
The criticism is logical and patient ; Mr. Pod- 
more's attitude is distinctly a judicial one. 
He is more than usually open to conviction on 
almost any point of the evidence. He is 
willing to examine, and examine closely, forms 
of evidence which others would dismiss because 



of their obvious suspiciousness. Mr. Podmore 
is also willing to concede that almost any form 
of manifestation which distinctly suggests 
something outside of the known world of law 
is worthy of such investigation. This attitude 
is the result of his association with investiga- 
tions in telepathy made by the English Society 
for Psychical Research. Mr. Podmore may 
be said to be a moderate believer in telepathy ; 
and this fact becomes apparent at various 
points. Many persons will regret that a his- 
tory of Spiritualism so entirely adequate in all 
respects should be marred by an attitude 
towards this problem which most persons would 
consider distinctly unscientific and in this 
connection almost irrelevant. It should not 
be understood that Mr. Podmore at all intrudes 
the telepathic hypothesis ; on the contrary, his 
self-restraint in this respect is most commend- 
able. But he presents the possibility of tele- 
pathy in such a way as to leave at least for a 
portion of the phenomena that mode of expla- 
nation as a final resource. 

In speaking of certain manifestations Mr. 
Podmore says : " The presumption in favor of 
fraud as an explanation of the physical phe- 
nomena is so overwhelming that it is not 
appreciably increased by a demonstration of 
fraud in any particular case." With that 
logical sentiment one may cordially agree. 
Had he abided by it literally, Mr. Podmore 
would have found therein a justification for 
refusing to examine and refute a large num- 
ber of alleged phenomena, which none the less 
he does examine, as though the proofs offered 
were really worthy of investigation. True, 
this is an error which in the present instance 
may have happy results, for it forestalls any 
criticism of inadequate investigation. On the 
other hand it fails to appeal to those of accur- 
ate habits of thought as a worthy method for 
so able a critic as Mr. Podmore to pursue. 
Apart from these defects, if such they be, the 
most careful critic will find little to object to 
in either of the volumes. Together they form 
not only an authoritative record of modern 
Spiritualism, but an unusually able and im- 
portant contribution to the history of culture 
in the nineteenth century. 

What then is the verdict of scientific in- 
quiry in regard to the true inwardness of the 
phenomena which are associated with modern 
Spiritualism ? The physical manifestations 
must be put down to fraud, predominantly to 
intentional fraud. So far as anything was 
done by the mediums that was noteworthy, it 



82 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



was nothing more than a performance in which 
the stage conjuror would excel. At times 
this explanation appears a little strained and 
seems to outrage one's faith in humanity. It 
seems harsh to assign fraud without apparent 
motive ; but in reality the investigation reveals 
motives for such deception that are a distinct 
contribution to the psychology of the subject. 
Take the most favorable case discussed in Mr. 
Podmore's book, — the phenomena occuring 
in the presence of William Stainton Moses, a 
man of apparently unimpeachable character, 
who for many was a pillar of the faith and 
whose mediumship is voluminously recorded 
in the pages of the Proceedings of the Society 
for Psychical Research. Mr. Podmore finds 
it his duty, and fortunately has the courage, 
to record that the only conclusion is " that it 
was he who tilted the table and produced the 
raps : that the scents, the seed pearls, and the 
Parian statuettes were brought into the room 
in his pockets ; and that the spirit-lights were, 
in fact, nothing more than bottles of phos- 
phorised oil." The mitigating sentence in the 
epitaph is the query whether these and other 
symptoms do not suggest the more charitable 
hypothesis that Mr. Moses was at least abnor- 
mal if not of unsound mind. 

Apart from fraud, which in this connection 
certainly covers a multitude of ills, we must 
add the proven powers of creating miracles to 
be ascribed to faulty observation, still faultier 
memory, prejudice, and credulity. When we 
are told of a medium sitting with one Mrs. 
Guppy " near the fire making up her accounts, 
when suddenly looking up she found that her 
companion had disappeared, leaving a slight 
haze near the ceiling"; that the husband of 
Mrs. Guppy on being informed of this mishap 
" remarked that no doubts the spirits had taken 
her, and shortly afterwards went down to 
supper "; and that it was later discovered that 
the last word written on her accounts before 
the spiritual flight was " onions," — we enter 
an atmosphere of credulity that has no relation 
to the world in which sanity moves. From 
similar sources we read of a baby writing spirit- 
guided messages ; and in far more cultured 
circles we have records of the floating out of 
one window and the return through another of 
the medium's body ; while more pitiable than 
either is the picture of a German professor — 
whose only excuse would be the enfeeblement 
of old age — sitting down with a professional 
slate-writing expert and hoping that by spirit 
aid and the fourth dimension of space the 



direction of the spiral of some snail shells 
would be reversed. 

To fraud and credulity we must add self- 
deception, which in its most pronounced form 
is to be found in connection with trance states 
and other types of automatic action. In this 
connection psychology has found a means of 
rationalising the associations to be formed 
with the term " medium " so far as the term 
is freed from the taint of the above sources of 
error. This is a small result, and one much 
more sanely to be arrived at in other ways, 
for so much tedious investigation. To these 
as the main sources of explanation — and 
neglecting the superstition and extravagance 
of belief which acts both as cause and as effect 
in the spiritualistic propagandum — may be 
added some minor and yet suggestive corolla- 
ries. In the end, the movement must be 
classified among the records of human error 
and vagary, with enough psychological worth 
mingled with it to rescue it from complete 
vacuity. 

Possibly this view is the outcome of one's 
personal temperament ; for Mr. Podmore's 
final words, after all this painstaking and pro- 
longed recounting of nauseous fraud, pitiable 
deception, and vulgar pretense, are a caution 
that after all there may be still some jewel in 
the rubbish-heap ; and that we should take a 
lesson from the persistent neglect of the valu- 
able phenomena of hypnotism — which neglect, 
however, presents no true analogy to the 
present case — and not *' for the second time, 
throw away the baby with the water from the 
bath." Joseph Jastrow. 



A Handbook of Western Birds.* 

The " Handbook of Birds of the Western 
United States," by Mrs. Florence Merriam 
Bailey, merits words of pure praise. It is a 
worthy complement to the " Handbook of the 
Birds of the Eastern States," by Mr. Frank 
M. Chapman ; and in saying this the best has 
been said. Mrs. Bailey has wisely followed 
the plan laid down in the earlier book, which 
is a model of clear and compact arrangement ; 
and by so doing she has established a harmony 
between the two treatises which enhances the 
value of both. Together they fulfil the needs

of the student of North American birds, ren- 
dering the identification of species inhabiting 
any quarter of the vast stretch of territory 
lying between the Atlantic and Pacific seas an 
easy and agreeable matter. 

Mra. Bailey was admirably fitted for the 
work she has now accomplished. A sister of 
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, director of the United 
States Biological Survey, she has had the 
influence of scientific methods in all her inves- 
tigations in the realms of natural history. 
For considerable periods she has been a resi- 
dent or a traveller in the Western States, not 
seldom making one of the party engaged under 
Dr. Merriam in studying the fauna in dif- 
ferent sections, and sharing in the labors, the 
pleasures, the freedom and restrictions of 
camp life. For years past she has filled a place 
among the authorities in her favorite science, 
her several text-books being approved as gen- 
uine contributions to American ornithology. 
This latest of her publications crowns her 
achievements in this direction, and is a noble 
monument to her ability and tireless industry. 

It is an immense territory which her hand- 
book covers, extending from the 100th to the 
125th meridian and from the Canadian to the 
Mexican boundaries ; and we may not be sur- 
prised at the richness of its avi fauna. It 
includes nearly eight hundred bird forms, sur- 
passing the number found in the Eastern 
States by more than three hundred. Five 
families are embraced in its catalogue which 
have no representative in the East. It excites 
our envy to read the description of sixteen 
species of humming-birds dwelling within the 
area surveyed by Mrs. Bailey, while the East 
has but one. We have likewise a single king- 
fisher ; and three frequent the Western States. 
Again, of the great sparrow family, numbering 
550 members altogether, 128 reside west of 
the hundredth meridian, and only 53 east of it. 

Not by any means do all the Western birds 
differ materially from those in the Eastern 
States. Many are common to both regions, 
while others are marked by such slight degrees 
of dissimilarity as to be ranked merely as 
varieties. Our robin, for example, ranges to 
the Pacific coast, bat loses meantime some 
characteristics of its Eastern form; while, as 
Mrs. Bailey relates, it experiences a decided 
change in its habits. With us it is the •• familiar 
bird of the door-yard," rejoicing us with its 
friendly companionship. In the West it is a shy, 
wild creature, choosing its home in retired 
places, rarely betraying its presence by an out- 



break of song, and scurrying in affright to the 
thicket at the approach of a human footstep. 

Mrs. Bailey leads her readers to the identi- 
fication of species by ample and well-defined 
keys. She aids them also by choice illustra- 
tions, comprising thirty-three full-page plates 
by Mr. Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and over six 
hundred cuts in the text. The bits of biogra- 
phy accompanying the summaries of technical 
characters, distribution, food, and nesting 
habits, compress with ingenious art the most 
desirable facts into the limited space allowed. 
These are not more noteworthy for the intelli- 
gence conveyed than for the felicitous language 
employed. 

Mrs. Bailey is fortunate in having the 
cooperation of her husband in her scientific 
work. For twenty years Mr. Vernon Bailey 
has been employed in the United States Sur- 
vey, becoming an adept in field research as in 
the use of the pen. A liberal part of the bio- 
graphical matter presented in the book under 
review bears his signature, and, like the work of

A JOURXALIST OF THK FRKXCH 

Revolution,* 



It is an advantage in trying to discern the 
character of some decisive event of the French 
Revolution to know how it impressed a man 
of definite type and experience. What Thomas 
Jefferson or Grouverneur Morris thought about 
the Paris insurrection, for example, may set it 
in its true relations, may add an element of 
interpretation which even a familiarity with 
all the details cannot supply. This gives a 
particular value to a biography of Mallet du 
Pan, one of the most prominent journalists of 
the period. 

Mallet du Pan came to Paris in 1783, as 
one of the editors of Panckoucke's newspaper,

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



the Mercure de France. A Protestant aristo- 
crat of the republic of Geneva, he brought a 
clear though unsympathetic intelligence to the 
study of French political conditions. If we 
may altogether trust a letter written when he 
had cause to doubt the capacity of the French 
for self-government, he could not from the 
outset see the utility of the Revolution. He 
had been convinced, he affirmed, that begun 
" among corrupt men, in a nation full of pre- 
sumption and frivolity, ardent but perverted, 
it would become the scourge of Europe after 
bemg that of France." In the summer of 
1789 he discovered that he had exchanged one 
sort of censorship for another, and that the 
warnings of district committees and Palais 
Royal groups might be even more ominous 
than those of the king's officers. It is not 
surprising that, although a republican, he 
should in the stress of conflict have been 
gradually driven into the position of a " rude " 
champion of strong government. As he criti- 
cised the Revolution in the spirit of the older 
royalists like Mounier and Malouet, his jour- 
nalistic career ended abruptly in 1792, and 
he crossed the frontier to aid the king's cause at 
the headquarters of the allies. He did not take 
up journalism again until 1797, when he was 
hunted out of Switzerland by the Directory. In 
London, during the short interval of life that re- 
mained, he created the Mercure Britannique. 
As a biography, the work of Mr. Bernard 
Mallet is more successful in the description of 
the earlier periods of Mallet du Pan's life and 
of bis last days than in its treatment of the 
years from 1793 to 1797. During these years 
he acted as " consulting physician " to the 
allies. It was a dreary business. His advice 
was not palatable, although he spiced it with 
the strongest denunciations of the French 
Revolutionists and all their works. A political 
correspondence of this sort is difficult to treat 
in such a manner that its purposes may be 
clearly defined and its weight in the politics 
of the time truly estimated. One can hardly 
escape the feeling that Mr. Mallet has occa- 
sionally approached his subject in the filial 
rather than in the historical spirit. There is 
too much similarity of tone and color in the 
figure and in the background. Possibly this 
effect arises from his substantial agreement 
with his ancestor's point of view and conclu- 
sions. It is certainly not due to any lack of 
fairmindedness, for he acknowledges in several 
cases that Mallet du Pan was mistaken, or ill- 
advised, or unduly influenced by the spirit of 



the struggle. He says the Revolution ended 
by throwing him " into a position of political 
antagonism to France, and its excesses betrayed 
him into expressing his opinions of the national 
character in harsh and unjust terms." But he 
explains this by remarking that " some exag- 
geration and violence of tone . . . are certain 
to be found in a series of secret memoranda 
presented to a Cabinet, and published, as his- 
torical criticism demands, in the exact form 
in which they were written." 

To what lengths Mallet du Pan's prejudices 
carried him, his biographer is hardly able fully 
to appreciate ; for his own conception of the 
Thermidorian period and of the Directory 
reveals an antagonism not less uncompromising. 
French politics were not at this time so uni- 
formly ignoble as he pictures. Furthermore, 
it is not altogether clear why " exaggeration 
and violence of tone " are to be expected in 
letters to " Cabinets." The allies sought from 
their agents facts rather than effective denun- 
ciations. Unhappily Mallet du Pan listened 
too readily to rumors that fell in with his 
notions of the condition of France. His 
picture of Robespierre's daily life, (inserted in 
a description of the members of the Committee 
of Public Safety,) must have stirred the readers 
of his letters more than it instructed them. 
Among other things, it says : 

" Today he is haggard, with hollow eyes and livid 
face, with restless and savage looks, and a countenance 
bearing the impress of crime and remorse. Tormented 
with terror, he is always escorted by three chosen 
sans-culottes, armed to the teeth, who accompany him 
in his carriage ; returning to his beggarly abode, he 
shuts himself and barricades himself within it, and 
opens the door only with the most extreme precautions. 
If he dines out, it is never without laying his two 
pistols on the table, one at each side of his plate ; no 
servant may stand behind his chair ; he partakes of no 
dish without one of the guests having eaten it before 
him ; he casts troubled and suspicious glances on all 
around him." 

In reading this biography one cannot avoid 
the conclusion that Mallet du Pan was the 
dupe of his august correspondents, just as he 
had been of the allies in July, 1792, when he 
undertook to clarify their minds upon the 
proper policy to be pursued in an armed inter- 
vention in France. Indeed, he pathetically 
confessed in 1797 that he would prefer to 
write for the public than for all the kings of 
the earth. When he takes up his broken 
career as a journalist he recaptures the sym- 
pathy of the reader. He is no longer under 
the illusion that by the sheer force of reasoning 
he can unite all Europe in an unselfish defense 



1903.] 



THE DTAL

of the established order against the destructive 
Revolutionary propaganda, but he is resolved 
not to withdraw from the fight so long as he 
has the strength to wield the pen. 

Mallet dn Pan was more successful in expos- 
ing weakness, folly, and injustice, than in 
marking out and advocating a policy which 
could lead to the mastery of the situation. 
Truth lost none of its sombre as]>ects through 
his exposition. Men were readier to admire 
his perspicacity than to accept his leadership. 
Even his friends the '■ Monarchiens " refused 
to make their opposition as persistent as did he. 

Of necessity, there must be a difference of 
opinion upon the value of his criticisms, 
although his newspaper and his letters will 
remain indispensable for the study of one phase 
of French opinion. It is not surprising that 
his picture of the Revolution was eulogized by 
Taine. for, as M. Monod remarked some years 
ago, Taine found among these papers whole 
pages which might have been taken from " The 
Modern Regime." After all, the chief value 
of his criticisms is the fact that the daily 
spectacle of the Revolution should have pro- 
duced such an impression upon a mind like his. 

Among the subjects of particular interest 
touched in this biography are Mallet du Pan's 
relations with Voltaire at Ferney, the incidents 
of his personal life at Paris, and the difficul- 
ties that met him in attempting to establish 
himself in London. There is a bibliography 
of his published writings and of the books 
written upon him. It would have been well 
to note for the sake of English readers, that 
the work of M. Sayons appeared in translation

Bat the first example of his work to come to oar 
attention is "The Deeps of Deliverance," now ad- 
mirably done into English by Miss Margaret Rob- 
inson. " The Limpid Lakes of Death " woald be 
a closer equivalent, bat a less happy one, for the 
original title of this work, which dates from about 
two years back. It is a very strong piece of wri- 
ting, saecessfol in the achievement of a clearly- 
defined um. That aim may not commend itself 
to all, because it is the portrayal of a somewhat 
morbid feminine type, and because in that portrayal 
it becomes necessary to bring us into close contact 
with the seamy side of life and to exhibit the baser 
possibilities of a woman's nature. The author is a 
realist in that be shrinks from nothing that is really 
needful for his purpose, but he has also the artist's 
instinct of reticence, and this saves him at more 
than one critical janetare. His plainness of speech 
may be found offensive, but it must be admitted 
even by those who object to it that the offense is 
not wanton, and is deliberate only in the sense that 
it is demanded by the exigencies of the author's 
theme.' The heroine, who is also the sole figure of 
interest in the entire work, is drawn from her child- 
hood up. She is a woman of delicately sensual 
predisposition, who early learns to fear her own in- 
stincts and to straggle against them, yet who even- 
tually is weak enough to yield, and who in conse- 
quence falls into the lowest depths of degradation. 
For her final rescue the author invokes the motive 
of mysticism, and works for her a spiritaal regen- 
eration. " How she sought the cool deeps wherein 
is deliverance, and how deliverance eime to her" — 
these are almost the first words of the book, and 
their promise sustains us through all the wretched- 
ness that follows. We may not accept the outcome 
as probable from the premises, but it is a solution 
that has oecarred more than once in human life, 
and it seems to embody a sincerely maintained 
point of view on the part of Dr. van E^en. When 
we contrast the depth and seriousness of this novel 
with the trivialities and superficialities upon which 
nearly every English and Aa w ka n novel in oar 
present list depends for interest, our racial pride 
is not exactly flattered. We had a closely parallel 
sensation not long ago. upon witnessing a stage-

duction8 of the day in oar own country. In both 
cases the lesson is clear enough ; while the novelists 
and the dramatists of the Continental countries 
(even the smaller ones) are trying to give their 
work the stamp of vital truth, our own writers in 
these fields are chiefly concerned with entertain- 
ment, and are content to be merely graceful, or 
clever, or ingenious. The literature which permits 
such qualities to become more than adjuncts in its 
task is the victim of a dry rot which threatens its 
very existence. 

Much of our most noteworthy recent work has 
been done in historical fiction, and yet the best of it 
seems insignificant when contrasted with the work 
of the great Continental writers. There is Herr 
Felix Dahn, for example, whose books are almost 
unknown to us, although they are unsurpassed in 
the breadth of vital knowledge with which they 
depict the period of the Volkerwanderung and the 
early strife of the Roman Empire with the hordes 
of "the Goth and the shameless Hun." We men- 
tion this great writer of historical romance because 
Miss Mary J. Safford has just translated " Bissula," 
one of his later works, which deals with the Roman 
invasion of the country about Lake Constance, and 
ends with the discomfiture and final repulse of the 
imperial legions. " A Captive of the Roman Eagles " 
is the title given to this translation, which may be 
commended as a piece of respectable workmanship, 
although hardly inspired. The poet Ausonins is one 
of the leading characters in this work, and his love 
for a fair daughter of the Alemanni, contrasted 
with the rival love of a young chieftain of her own 
people, provides the main element of romantic in- 
terest. But the book has other interests also, inter- 
ests that illuminate the life of the whole period, and 
make us feel that we are borne along by the cen- 
tral current of early European history. The eru- 
dition of the author is of the most solid type, but 
he knows how to subdue it to artistic service. 

The posthumous novel, " No Other Way " is pre- 
sumably the last work of fiction that we shall have 
from the late Walter Besant. It is a story of the 
London which the author knew so well, and of the 
eighteenth century, with the customs and institu- 
tions of which he was so intimately acquainted. 
The old theme of imprisonment for debt, a favorite 
with so many of the earlier novelists, provides the 
book with its chief interest, and illustrates anew the 
similarity between Besant and Dickens, in materials, 
motives, and methods. The plot of the story must 
be called strained, if not improbable. A gentle- 
woman in distress, and in danger of arrest by her 
creditors, resorts to Newgate for a husband, be- 
cause the law will save her from the debtor's prison 
if she be married. The only person found available 
for her is a desperate negro criminal, who is to be 
hanged in a day or two. Since there seems to be 
"no other way" out of her plight, she is married 
to this man, and then leaves him to his fate. Since 
we are concerned with a novel and not with real life, 
it ia a matter of course that the criminal should 



escape hanging, and return in a later chapter to 
plague the heroine. The situation thus created is 
quite exciting, but it must be admitted that the con- 
ception upon which the novel is based is rather 
repulsive, and would be intolerable were we not 
certain that in Sir Walter's hands the plot would 
be managed in a way to spare our susceptibilities. 

Mr. " Anthony Hope " is hardly to be congratu- 
lated on " The Intrusions of Peggy." There is 
abundant cleverness in the book, and the sort of brill- 
iant sophisticated dialogue at which Mr. Hawkins 
has few equals, but there is not the sustained novel- 
interest that we are justified in expecting from the 
author of " The Prisoner of Zenda " and " Tristram 
of Blent." Peggy is a very satisfactory person in- 
deed, but although she gives the book its title, her 
place in the plot is subordinate. The two chief 
characters are a young widow who gets into finan- 
cial difiiculties and a man of middle age whom she 
eventually marries. Neither of these persons can be 
called sympathetic. The man is miserly, the most 
unpardonable of all heroic attributes, and the 
woman is so absolutely devoid of serious purpose 
that the reader does not greatly care when she be- 
comes stupidly involved in debt through a reckless 
speculation. There is a feeling that she deserves 
all that she gets, and perhaps more. Of course there 
is much delicate comedy in the treatment of the 
situation, and keen satire of English society and its 
characteristic types. But of human interest in any 
deep sense there is very little, and there is not even 
the substitute of purely romantic interest that we 
are willing to accept upon occasion. 

The author of " The Column " does not seem to 
have advanced upon that striking first book in the 
composition of " Love with Honour." Mr. Marriott 
has constructed a complicated and ingenious plot, 
which holds us fairly in suspense until near the 
close, and he has given us faithful studies of sev- 
eral rather unusual types of character, but he has 
missed the note of sentimental idealism which was 
the chief charm of the earlier novel. His charac- 
ters make disagreeable company, on the whole, and 
remind us a little of the sort of people who figure 
in the fictions of "Benjamin Swift," from whose 
methods the author seems to have taken a lesson, to 
the detriment of his own peculiar talent. This is 
the sort of book of which one forgets the very sub- 
stance a few weeks after it has been put aside. 

By way of a brief introductory characterization 
of Mr. Lang's " The Disentanglers," we may say 
that it revives the sensations with which we first 
read " The New Arabian Nights," but with the 
deeper interest that might have attached to that 
romantic masterpiece had it embodied suggestions 
from the method of Grant Allen and of the creator 
of Sherlock Holmes. This is surely enough to 
commend it to the judicious, were anything needed 
beyond the name of the author. The disentanglers 
are two young men, belonging to good society but 
impecunious, who cast about for some means of 
"raising the wind." The result is a partnership,

and the formation of a bareaa for giring advice to 
people who have become entangled in sentimental 
or matrimonial complications. Counsel in these 
delicate matters is discreetly and confidentially 
provided by the bareaa, and active measures are 
taken for the disentanglement of the social knots 
offered for treatment. The main reliance is an 
ingenious system of counter-irritants whereby, for 
example, the wealthy bachelor who is bent upon 
marrying his cook, to the disgust of the expectant 
heirs, is gently diverted from his purpose by being 
exposed to the charms of a young woman who acts 
as the agent of the bureau. These agents, it should 
be added, are supposed to be sentimentally immune, 
so that they can withdraw unscathed from the 
scene of operations when their work is done. Mr. 
Lang's application of this idea results in a series 
of the most surprising stories imaginable — stories 
which start out under prosaic conditions, and sud- 
denly plange into the wildest and most romantic 
sensationalism. The stories are brilliant both as to 
style and invention, besides abounding in sly allo- 
sions and satirical touches that will be caviare to 
the general, but a source of keen delight to those 
who have an extensive acquaintance with the writ- 
ings of the gentleman (or syndicate?) known as 
Mr. Andrew Lang. We may remark, incidentally, 
that the disentanglers of this story become entan- 
gled themselves — happily and for good — before 
the end is reached. 

Mr. J. Storer Clouston is the author of a strange 
medley of semi-romantic and humorous incident 
which he calls " The Adventures of M. d' Haricot." 
It tells of a Frenchman in London, living as an 
exile, although his banishment from home seems to 
be self-imposed, for a person of his character and 
temperament could not well be a dangerous con- 
spirator against the French government. The 
advertisements describe the book as a compound 
of " rollicking fun," but we have read it from 
cover to cover without discovering anything of the 
sort. Monsieur d' Haricot becomes mildly amus- 
ing at times, especially in his relations with the 
gentler sex, but he never stirs the reader to genuine 
mirth. One gets the impression that the author 
had an excellent chance for effective work, and 
just missed it. 

" A Doffed Coronet " is a story in the form of 
autobiography. The writer pretends to be, and 
very likely is, the wife of an English diplomat 
attached to the Egyptian court in the days just 
after the Arabi rebellion. It is with the Cairo of 
twenty years ago, social, official, and political, that 
the first half of the book is concerned. It is 
clearly written from the inside, and by a woman 
who had unusual opportunities to observe matters 
of a kind that do not come to the knowledge of the 
general public. Midway in the book the scene 
shifts to America, for the diplomat loses his fortune 
through an ill-advised speculation, and both he and 
his wife are too proud to seek to hold their position 
in European society under these altered circum- 



stances. So these people, who have associated 
with the great ones of earth, and who have had a 
part in the making of history, exile themselves to 
the new world, and adapt themselves, not without 
difficulty, to the changed conditions of their exist- 
ence. A certain familiarity with American ways 
and speech indicates that this part of the book also 
has some basis of actual observation, yet some of 
the characterizations are so grotesque that they 
cannot be based upon anything but imagination. 
The title-page informs us that this is *' a true 
story," and much of it bears the visible stamp of 
truth. It certainly is not a novel in the ordinary 
sen^e, for no work of conscious invention would 
ever lead to such an anti-climax as is here pre- 
sented. It is a puzzling performance, but one well 
worth examination for its general cleverness, and 
for the brilliant picture of Egyptian life contained 
in the op>ening chapters. 

When " The Prisoner of Zenda " was set loose 
about ten years ago, its author little imagined the 
brood of imitations that would follow in its train. 
So familiar has the type since become that we may 
speak of a " Zenda " romance with perfect confi- 
dence in the intelligibility of the designation. Just 
now we have before us two new examples of this 
sort of invention, notable, however, for the same 
variant feature. In both cases, the hero gets the 
princess at last ; in the one case because the princess 
is determined to have him at any cost, and in the 
other because the prince is conveniently killed in an 
insurrection. Mr. John R. Carling's " The Shadow 
of the Czar " opens mysteriously on the coast of 
Dalmatia, where hero and heroine meet under 
singularly romantic circumstances. Then the scene 
is transferred to the Polish principality which is 
the real centre of the action. The territory is one 
which the Czar (Nicholas I.) seeks to annex. The 
hand of the princess is sought by a wicked duke, 
who, failing in his suit, plays into the hands of the 
Bussian court, and nearly accomplishes the ex- 
tinction of the principality. But the hero, being an 
Englishman, is necessarily triumphant in the end, 
the wicked duke is slain, and even the Czar is out- 
witted. This is a particularly lively story, and 
ranks a trifle above the usual sensational level of 
its class. 

'•The Garden of Lies," by Mr. Justus Miles 
Forman, is about a Balkan principality also endan- 
gered by Russian designs. The prince is married 
to an American wife, who shortly after becoming a 
princess has a severe illness from which she re- 
covers with a total lapse of memory for recent hap- 
penings. She is in Paris under a physician's care, 
and her husband is in the Balkans combating Rus- 
sian intrigue. She is informed that she has a 
husband, and naturally wishes to make his acquaint- 
ance. Her condition of mind is such that it be- 
comes imperative to provide a husband of some 
sort, since the legal one is supposedly unable to 
come to Paris. In this emergency, a rollicking 
Irish adventurer is persuaded to enact the role on-

til such time as the prince may be able to appear 
in person. Unfortunately for the plot, the Irish- 
man is a gentleman of parts, with a most persuasive 
gift for love-making. The natural result is that the 
two straightway became enamoured of one another. 
At this juncture the prince appears unexpectedly 
and is far from pleased with the state of affairs. 
Then there is an abduction of the princess by 
agents of the Russian party, a thrilling rescue by 
her Irish lover, and a mix-up all around. She 
learns the trick that has been played upon her, 
tries to be indignant and forget her new-found 
love, and miserably fails. The prince then goes 
back to quell an insurrection, gets killed in the 
scrimmage, while the Irishman (who has accom- 
panied him) miraculously escapes, and returns to 
his love, now widowed and free to follow the dic- 
tates of her heart. It is a good deal of a story 
altogether, and may be recommended for enter- 
tainment. 

Mr. Crawford's "Cecilia " is a story of modern 
Rome, and in that aspect has points of interest. The 
author knows Rome and its society better than he 
knows anything else, and his Roman scenes and fig- 
ures are always carefully studied. But here commen- 
dation of the new novel must cease, for it tells no 
story worth the telling, while for its romantic interest 
reliance is had upon the sort of supernaturalism for 
which Mr. Crawford has a weakness, and which he 
would evidently have us take seriously. It is curi- 
ous how the telepathic delusion takes possession of 
some minds that are well equipped and rational up- 
on most subjects. Even when the many unneces- 
sary pages are skipped, this novel seems incapable 
of arousing more than a languid interest. 

"The Taskmasters," by Mr. George Kibbe Tur- 
ner, is the first volume of the " First Novel Series " 
that has been projected by a leading firm of pub- 
lishers. We may say at once that the series will 
be in no danger of failure if it can be maintained up- 
on the level of this novel. The theme is found in 
the political and business life of a New England fac- 
tory town, and, although well worn in its main out- 
lines, this theme is here set forth with a degree of 
judgment and literary skill that has not often been 
equalled. It is a book of honest and manly ideals 
presented without exaggeration or the appeal of 
false sentiment. On the political side, it exhibits 
the corrupting influence of a great employer of labor 
upon the community which he dominates by his 
wealth, and exposes the hypocrisies of the protective 
system. But at the same time it presents the case 
of the employer with fairness, and does not gloss 
over the faults of the employed. In the unending 
struggle for the amelioration of social conditions, the 
author sees no profit in radical measures, and is too 
clear-sighted to denounce the selfishness of capital- 
ism as the sole cause of the present unsatisfactory 
relations. His outlook is expressed in a fine passage 
which comes near the close of the book, and which 
we wish to reproduce. " A new sound has come into 
the land these last few years — the voice of the little 



h priori thinker, with his tinsel, ready-made universe, 
formed in a night from the discarded timber of a 
hundred familiar systems of the workingphilosophers 
of a century ; the cry of the bearded apostle of the 
future, a strange new hybrid of a prophet and a 
walking delegate ; an inventor of another new Utopia, 
wailing in the market place because mankind refu- 
ses all at once to step aboard his new flying machine, 
and be whisked away across the yawning precipi- 
ces of the unknown to regions of ineffable bliss. 
All these things have their places in the great econ- 
omy of nature, no doubt, — a bare-headed socialist 
calling beneath the electric light across the half 
deserted street ; a religious sentimentalist harangu- 
ing his weekly parcel of old maids in the resounding 
vestry of a church ; a pismire shouting from his 
blade of grass for a fixed star to change its course. 
Meanwhile society moves on in its great orbit. 
Compromise succeeds compromise, one little gain 
another — new conditions, new privileges, new 
generations, better, more intelligent than the old ; 
new inventions, changing the whole face of contin- 
ents ; society working out its vast experiments — in 
the great cities, in these hundred towns and villages 
of ours — the tremendous laboratories of the experi- 
ence of mankind, forming slowly, painfully, but 
magnificently, the new order of things under our 
very eyes." It is welcome to find a book, dealing 
with the social problem in this spirit, that is perme- 
ated by as sound a social philosophy. Considered 
simply as a story, the book is well-planned and 
deeply interesting. Its studies of the baser types 
that figure in local politics are convincingly realized ; 
the figures of hero and heroine are truthfully drawn, 
and the grim climax of the plot, with the tragic 
death of the magnate in the very hour of his politi- 
cal triumph, is managed with a degree of skill that 
promises much for the future of this young writer. 
He tells his story directly, with nervous animation, 
and without resort to the weakly sentiment in which 
most young writers upon these themes take refuge. 
The book is a strong and wholesome performance, 
and deserves to be widely read. 

Another novel that plunges us into the political 
life of recent years is Mr. Mark Lee Luther's 
" The Henchman." Here the scene is a New York 
town and, as in the novel just reviewed, the ambi- 
tion of a local leader to become Governor of the 
State is the central motive of the narrative. He 
is a politician of a coarse type,' who pulls wires, 
makes demagogic speeches, and enters into corrupt 
bargains for the achievement of his purpose, and 
by these methods he climbs the ladder round by 
round until his ambition is achieved. But during 
this rake's progress of his political career a curious 
thing is going on. There are certain latent possi- 
bilities of the finer sort in his nature, and these 
gradually come to the surface, while the responsi- 
bilities of power exert upon him a sobering and 
even uplifting influence. He reaches a point at 
which the step from the governorship to the presi- 
dency seems to be within his reach, but it is a step

that may only be taken at the price of absolate 8ab- 
servieney to the leader of the party machine. And 
the process of anconscioas apvrard growth has so 
stiffened the moral fibre of the governor that in the 
critical hoar he ref ages sabmission, and deliberately 
throws away his opportanity. We are thos left at the 
end with a feeling of admiration for the man whose 
eonrse ap to this time has seemed despicable and 
witboat redeeming virtoes. We would not say that 
the ease of this man offers a typical example of the 
career of the saceessfal American politician, bat we 
believe that the sort of growth it describes does some- 
times go on, and that it represents a possible eneoar- 
aging aspect of the conditions that obtain in oar 
political cesspwol. As a pictare of recent New York 
politics, the book is closely studied from the life, 
and on more than one occasion we read the name 
of some real person for that of the fictitioas char- 
acter of the author's devising. 

The story of a boy whose childhood is beset by 
all sorts of difficulties, and who by sheer force of 
intellect and character rises superior to his sor- 
ronndings, and makes for himself both name and 
position, is what Mr. George A. Powles gives as in 
" Oliver Langton." Stories of this type are mainly 
interesting in proportion to their sincerity and 
their sympathetic knowledge of the life depicted. 
These qualities go far, in the present instance, to 
make ap for amatearishness and the lack of tech- 
nical equipment. The scene of the story is rural 
Upper Canada, and the time is the period of the 
creation and first years of the Dominion. We have 
here an intimate picture of provincial life, in which 
nothing is spared us of the ftettiness and prejudice 
in religious and social matters, or of the ignorant 
materialism of the time and place. With all thia 
photographic detail the author has combined s vein 
of worthy idealism, although his treatment suffers 
somewhat from the prominence of the didactic 
element 

Historical romance has rather neglected the 
later stages of the American Revolution, with the 
exception of the surrender at Yorktown. The 
campaign in the Carolinas and through Virginia is, 
no doubt, less interesting because less significant 
than the operations about the three chief cities or 
in the valley of the Hudson. In writing -'The 
Master of Appleby," Mr. Francis Lynde has chosen 
for his theme this less familiar phase of the Revo- 
lution, the scene being laid in and around Meck- 
lenburg (of the mythical Declaration ) for the most 
part. Otherwise, the romance is constructed of 
conventional material, and is not much differentiated 
from others of its class, unless it be by the sur- 
prising number and variety of the hero's adventures 
and escapes. It is a novel of more than the com- 
mon length, and of fairly sustained interest. 

Stories of the Civil War we have had a-plenty of 
late years, and most of them could be easily spared, 
but we should be sorry to spare as good a story as 
" The Whirlwind," by Mr. Rupert Hughes. The 
hero is a country boy who grows ap under condi- 



tions of abject poverty, and who has to straggle to 
gain even the beginnings of an education. But he 
has purpose, and character, and will, and makes 
himself first a country lawyer, then a soldier and 
officer in the Northern army, then a representative 
and a senator, and finally a popular presidential 
candidate, who would probably have won the elec- 
tion had he not been struck down by the hand of 
the assassin. The author has had both Lincoln 
and Garfield in mind in drawing this composite 
portrait of soldier and statesman, although, of 
course, he departs widely from the actual history 
of either man. The war chapters take us from 
Missouri to Greorgia, and we are with Mulligan at 
Lexington and Sherman at Atlanta. The curious 
brogue which is placed upon the lips of the former 
of these officers must appear very surprising to 
those who knew him for the highly-educated and 
polished gentleman that he was ; tbis slip on the 
author's part evidently comes from the hasty infer- 
ence that because Mulligan was an Irishman his 
speech must have been that which is traditional 
upon the comic stage. We cannot quite reconcile 
ourselves to the moral weakness of the hero in his 
relations with women ; this seems entirely out of 
keeping with his character as otherwise set before 
us, and is not artistically justified. But the book 
is a good one, on the whole, and illustrates anew 
the fact that the novelists of our younger genera- 
tion not only know the Civil War as history, bat 
feel it in its " whirlwind " character, and also, we 
might add, in its character as a refining fire.

terval, a work closely akin to them, Mr. W. W. 
Bates's scholarly volume on "American Navigation," 
the three attesting the revival of interest in oar

Of the two books before us, the first is the work of 
one who has given years of attention to the general 
subject of our ships and ship companies, and has 
already produced several books dealing with the 
subject. This work is the more popular in treatment 
of the two, written with a freer hand and with less 
minuteness of detail, and illustrated with many ex- 
cellent drawings by Mr. Ray Brown. Mr. Marvin 
has been somewhat more technical and maeh more 
explicit, his work being the more copious, although

[Feb. 1, 



the books are of practically similar dimensions. Mr. 
Marvin is more concerned, also, with the earlier his- 
tory of our merchant shipping, following the tale 
through the colonial days, and coming to substantial 
agreement with Mr. Edgar Stanton Maclay in regard 
to the importance of the services rendered the Amer- 
ican cause by privateers during our two wars with 
Great Britain. Both books are of so nearly the same 
subject-matter, no single topic of importance escap- 
ing either, that a description of one will serve as 
a description of both, with the slight differences 
already noted. But neither, strangely enough, deals 
adequately with the hideous treatment accorded 
American common sailors to-day on sea-going 
vessels under the American flag, a factor of no 
slight importance in the general decay attending 
all American shipping except on the great lakes, 
where trades unionism has been successful in ame- 
liorating many abuses still common on the salt seas. 
No chapter in either book is more interesting than 
that discussing the commerce of the great lakes, and 
the inland rivers also provide interesting reading. 
Both books can be cheerfully recommended.

titled " Charlotte Bronte, George 
Eliot, Jane Austen" (Longmans) a careful and sym- 
pathetic, though somewhat plodding and occasion- 
ally rambling, piece of work. The abundance of 
quotation and allusion comes dangerously near 
being over-abundance and thus obscuring, rather 
than illustrating, the author's points. The first- 
named of this immortal trio he regards as unri- 
valled for " purity of passion "; the second excels 
in " mastery of range " and " spiritual depth of 
imagination," as distinguished from its playful 
buoyancy ; while the third he styles " the Meis- 
sonier of literary art and the fair mistress of its 
subtlest intricacies," and especially extols her " easy 
flow and tempered finesse." His placing of Jane 
Austen last, " as a dessert after the more solid 
courses which have preceded," is not so surprising 
when one hears his reasons. She was, he says, 
" content with picturing the life she saw ; we search 
for the philosophy which will explain it. . . . We 
have reserved Miss Austen, then, that in studying 
her works, with the more modern ' notes ' of her 
successors still ringing in our ears, we may more 
clearly understand the great differences between 
that time and this, and find therein their partial 
explanation." A few minor matters in the book 
provoke critical comment. Reference is made to 
Charlotte Bronte's loneliness and unworldliness as 
chiefly responsible for the lack of wit in her novels. 
Humor rather than wit would seem to be the right 
word here. Why, one queries, does the author 
speak, as he does more than once, of male and 
female gender when he means sex? Referring to 
a certain degenerate class of fiction, he instances 
" d'Abruzzio " as typical of the school, presumably 
meaning d'Annunzio. 



When some fifteen or twenty years 
The reign of ^^ jugji^ McCarthy's "His- 

tory of Our Own limes appeared, 
the public welcomed it warmly as a distinct acquisi- 
tion in general popular history, while even from a 
technical point of view it was considered a really 
valuable contribution to the knowledge of the day. 
Indeed from the first, the popularity of the book 
was assured. The wit of the author, his ability in 
characterization, his simple directness in statement, 
were elements in a style of writing which was at- 
tractive and quite his own. The very partisanship 
with which the book was written gave it an added 
interest as marking the personal attitude of Mr. 
McCarthy and his political faction. At various 
times since the publication of this earlier work, ad- 
ditional volumes from Mr. McCarthy's workshop 
have appeared, none of them up to the grade of 
" The History of Our Own Times." The latest of 
these, "The Reign of Queen Anne" (Harper) is 
as conspicuously deficient in marks of genuine merit 
as most of its predecessors. And yet, having ven- 
tured upon a period rich in interest, and lacking 
in modern comment, it is indeed a pity that Mr. 
McCarthy's discrimination in selection could not 
be followed by real ability in execution. Either the 
author underrates the qualifications of a writer of 
history, or he labors under the delusion that striking 
characterizations and witty descriptions dropper se 
from his pen. The story of the period is told with a 
dull directness, clear enough in statement, but never 
entertaining, and utterly devoid of that power of 
characterization which Mr. McCarthy certainly pos- 
sesses. As a study, the work is even more conspic- 
uously a failure. No statement is possible of the 
sources investigated, for none are cited, but in so 
far as the text is evidence, these are limited to the 
observations and writings of Swift, Burnet, and 
Defoe. There is no indication that the author even 
knows of the existence of the new sources of infor- 
mation upon the relations of Harley with Queen 
Anne, Marlborough, Defoe, and others, published at 
intervals within the last few years by the British 
Historical Manuscripts Commission. A history of 
the reign of Queen Anne which does not make large 
use of this new material is in fact an absurdity. 
This fault might be forgiven in Mr. McCarthy, 
who is after all no historian, if he had furnished 
us with a readable narrative, or even with a bright 
bit of special pleading. Lacking these, the present 
work is much below his own standard, and in it Mr. 
McCarthy is first of all unjust to himself. 

" That a state may be well consti- 
tuted, ethical principles should form 
the base and groundwork of its 
Constitution." This quotation seems to express 
the purpose of a somewhat extended thesis by Mr. 
Frederick Wood, entitled " Government and the 
State" (Putnam). The author devotes three hun- 
dred pages to an a priori discussion of " elemen- 
tary principles and their practical application,"

inclndiog the reasons for the existence of the Satte, 
its objects, basis, and sphere of action, its forms 
and fanetions, and, incidentally, the characters it 
assames under constitntions. This discossion of 
the fandamentals of the State proceeds logically, 
and the argumentation is clear and pterspicuous. 
The author agrees with the leading political econo- 
mists that the sanction for the existence of the 
State is found in necessity ; and he keeps before 
his readers the principle that all its operations 
should have an ethical basis, saying in one place 
that '^ the material principles of human rights, it 
has been the purpose of this work to designate aa 
the sole foundation on which political philosophy 
can rest." The book will be welcomed by the 
general reader, who will enjoy connoting it with 
the obserrations of Blantschli and Willoaghby, 
whose works it will supplement but not displace. 
It will entertain students, but it would be more 
serviceable to them if the propositions of the text, 
which are stated concisely and without citations of 
authority, were accompanied by references to some 
of th« leading text- writers who have previously 
supported the same views. It is in rare cases only 
that the thesis names other authorities. This may 
be due to the fact that Mr. Wood, who was a law- 
yer of New York City, died while the book was in 
preas. One may regret that an editor was not 
engaged, to annotate the author's manuscript and 
supply the references which students would have 
found so usefoL 

It is extremely difficult to take a 
»»*» TJato**"** comprehensive view of Italy and the 

Italians, because of the great dif- 
ferences of life, habits, character, and (to some 
extent) language, in the various portions of the 
Italian Peninsula. There are. in the first place, a 
Northern, a Southern, and a Central Italy, to be 
taken into separate consideration. There are dif- 
ferent styles and manners in architecture, painting, 
and sculpture, each centring upon a separate lo- 
cality. These local differences — more marked in 
Italy than in any other European country — are 
andonbtedly United Italy's inheritance from Di- 
Tided Italy, and they will be gradually modified as 
time goes on and as the Italians become accus- 
tomed to their new political conditions. But at 
the present time, to produce a picture of Italy and 
Italians that would be alike comprehensive and 
intelligible would be no easy matter. We would 
have said that such a picture was impossible, were 
it not that Signor Lnigi Villari, in his ■■ Italian 
Life in Town and Country" (Putnam), succeeds 
in presenting it. The author's observations have 
been widely extended and are remarkably acute. 
He knows his Italy well. He neglects nothing 
that may serve to illustrate any important phase 
of Italian character ; nor does he regard any 
phase of life unimportant that might be of interest 
to those who want to know the country and people 
whereof he writes. He treats of the political, 



/kuMrya/JTajte. 



religious, military, and agricultural life of the Ital- 
ians, and of the government and the civil service ; 
he exhibits the social and home-life of the people 
of various classes, — aristocrats, people of wealth, 
artisans, and peasants, — and introduces his readers 
to the popular sports of the different localities, 
without any slighting of literature, mosie, or art. 
Altogether the book is a valuable addition to the 
series of " Our European Neighbors " to which it 

belongs. 

It is a pleasure to find a book like 
Mr. Untersteiner's " Short History 
of Music" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 
adding to the merits of conciseness and clearness 
the virtue of not being dolL The author has 
shaken the necessary dry leaves of fact from the 
tree of knowledge, but for the most part has seen 
to it that they fell upon a good green carpet of 
interesting comment. The book gives a conaeentiTe 
story of music unblurred by trivialitiea of iMOg- 
raphy. The name of each musician is made to 
shine by the light of his contribution to music, 
rather than by the number of his wives and chil- 
dren. The critical comments show not only intelli- 
gence, but imaginative insight. For example: " If 
in Palestrina we find represented the divine ele- 
ment which humbles itself to humanity, in Bach 
there dominates a human element which, liberating 
itself from terrestrial fetters and cares, rises to 
heaven, confides there its sorrows, its griefs, and 
its anguish, finding comfort and peace after the 
struggle." And again : '' Haydn's motiTes seem 
to come of neeeesity from the instruments, and we 
are interested in the manner of treatment by the 
composer. Mozart, on the other hand, makes 
themes speak his language ; his motives are more 
expressive, and foreshadow Beethoven." Nor does 
the author forget, in hia ngard for unity, how 
broad and deep his thene is. He treats music not 
as an invention, but as a development. The influ- 
ence of race, religion, and history on music is 
touched upon — lightly, to be snre, bat with precision. 
As a book of reference the little volume would 
have been improved by an index, but the arrange- 
ment is so clear as to mitigate this fault M(we 
annoying to the general reader are occasional fanlts 
of style, which it would seem the translator might 
have done more than he has to correct.

from reviews in current periodicals. About 100

leaving only a dozen that are drawn from other

but we doubt the wisdom of confining the source 
of the notices within such narrow limits. The 
book should contain more than can be obtained by 
consulting the indices of two easily accessible peri- 
odicals. The notice of each book listed should be 
based upon what appears to be from all points of 
view the best review of the particular book, regard- 
less of the medium of publication ; and then, as 
we suggested in connection with the original work, 
reference should be given for purposes of com- 
parison to all the other important reviews. Not- 
withstanding the defect we have mentioned, the

owners of the larger work. 

In "The Lost Art of Reading" 

artK^;.'"' (P"'"*"") Mr. Gerald Stanley Lee 
brings together a number of his 
magazine essays, all bearing upon the general 
proposition that the spirit of to-day is " The Man 
for the Book; not the Book, nor indeed any Thing 
else, for the Man." Whether or not we are all so 
oppressed by the weight of contemporary publica- 
tion as Mr. Lee, or so confident of the ability of 
our collegiate engines to grind out machine-made 
men to their order, there is still enough truth in his 
contention, and far and away enough charm in his 
method of address to win and hold attention. 
Mr. Lee does not make a programme for the re- 
discovery of the art of reading, further than to 
explain what obstacles are in the way, and to insist 
that reading will continue to be a lost art until 
living ceases to be a lost art and, losing our fear of 
egotism, we resolve once more to be natural. He 
is, in short, a very Emersonian individualist, but he 
has a way of saying the Emersonian thing over in 
an entirely original way, — which is of course the 
Emersonian way of saying it. Remembering Mr. 
Lee's other book, "The Shadow Christ," we would 
suggest that " The Lost Art of Reading " is too 
long to be always Mr. Lee at his best. But that 
is not to say that once begun it does not insist on 
being read through to the end, particularly if one 
happens to belong to any of the three classes which 
Mr. Lee finds particularly hostile to the spirit of 
true reading — the college professor, the modern- 
ized librarian, and the professional critic. 



A woman}g 
political gossip 
in letters. 



To anyone with a passion for the 
minutiae of English diplomatic his- 
tory, the " Letters of Princess 
Lieven " (Longmans) written from London to her 
brother at St. Petersburg during the years 1812-34, 
and now collected by Mr. Lionel G. Robinson in a 



stout octavo of 400 closely printed pages, will not 
seem tiresome. The editor thinks that at no time 
have personal feelings and private interests played 
so important a part in political history as during 
the period in question. Hence the considerable 
influence that the Princess Lieven, wife of the Rus- 
sian embassador, was able to exert upon English 
politics, foreign and domestic. Her salon was as 
great a centre of political activity as was Holland 
House, or the salon of Lady Hertford, or that of 
Lady Jersey. For the best effect her letters should 
probably be read in the original French. Their 
alternations of exaltation and depression would 
thus appear less akin to the hysterical, their adula- 
tion of her emperor less extravagantly fulsome. 
Next to poetry what can suffer more from transla- 
tion than the airy trifles of intimate correspond- 
ence? This is no reflection upon the present trans- 
lator, who has done his difficult part admirably, so 
far as one can judge without comparing the two 
texts. The princess had no taste for books, but 
was keenly alive to people and events, and she 
wrote with much of that sprightliness and fluency 
that properly belong to the letter-writing sex. 

Robert Louis Stevenson's personal- 
TsZ'^sTilna. jty i« ""^^ »f ^hich we are eager to 

know all that his friends and family 
are willing to tell us. They have been very gener- 
ous of their store ; Sidney Colvin has written, and 
Graham Balfour, and now Stevenson's two step- 
children, Mrs. Isobel Strong and Mr. Lloyd Os- 
bourne, have collaborated in a volume of " Memories 
of Vailima" (Scribner). Mrs. Strong reproduces 
the familiar talk of the little circle from jottings 
made in 1892 and 1893, and writes charmingly of 
her Samoan proteg6, and of the Samoan songs that 
were made about " Tusitala " and his family by 
the men who loved him. Mr. Osbourne's chapter 
upon Stevenson's home-life at Vailima describes the 
building of the house and the patriarchal regulation 
of its curious manage. Besides these four essays, 
the volume contains a hitherto unpublished poem 
written by Stevenson in 1872. Although the book 
tells us nothing that will be absolutely new to those 
who have read the Vailima letters and the biog- 
raphy, its odds and ends of reminiscence have the 
charm that belongs to all Stevensoniana. With its 
many illustrations made from photographs by the 
authors, this volume will be prized by all lovers of 
Robert Louis Stevenson's unique personality.

This voluminous catalogue extends to five hundred 
pages, and fully exploits the resources of the Library

the sciences — physical, natural, social, and applied, — 
it touches also upon art, literature, and history ; and 
will be of use to nearly all classes of stadencs. 

"The Mishongnovi Ceremonies of the Snake and 
Antelope Fraternities," by Messrs. George A. Dorsey 
and H. R. Votb, is a publication of the Field Colum- 
bian Museum, and represents a further instalment of 
the scholarly fruits that have grown out of the Stanley 
McCormick Uopi Expedition. Another recent publi-

The New Amsterdam Book Co. are doing students 
of American history a valuable service in preparing a

monwealth Library," as the series is designated, is 
Cadwallader Colden's " The History of the Five Indian 
Nations of Canada," in two volumes. Mr. Robert 
Waite contributes an introduction. 

The " Pocket Series of English Classics" (Macmillin) 
is augmented by the following new volumes: "Early 
American Orations, 1760-1824," edited by Miss Louie 
R. Heller; Macaalay's " Essay on Lord Clive," edited 
by Mr. J. W. Pearce; "As You Like It," edited by

the more important papers we may mention that of the 
late President Beardshear on " The Three H's in Edu-

94 



THE DIAL 



[Feb, 1, 



will include nearly thirty thousand titles, making 
readily available for reference the contents of over 
three hundred standard collections. 

"The Western Slope" is the title of a volume of 
essays by Mrs. Celia Parker Woolley, to be issued 
early next month by Mr. William S. Lord of Evanston. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish a school volume 
containing " Select Poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge," 
chronologically arranged, annotated, and otherwise ed- 
ited by Mr. Andrew J. George, who has done a highly 
creditable piece of work. 

A " Grammar School Algebra," by Mr. Emerson E. 
White, is published by the American Book Co., who 
also send us, in their " Eclectic School Readings," a vol- 
ume of " True Fairy Stories," written for kindergarten 
use by Mrs. Mary E. Bakewell. 

Mr. John Lane publishes a volume of the " Selected 
Poems " of Mr. William Watson. In thus giving us 
the best of Mr. Watson's work, and that only, a real 
service is done to his reputation, for at his best he is 
a true poet, while at his weakest he is very far from 
being anything of the sort. 

The " Hampstead " edition of " The Poetical Works 
of John Keats," published by the Macmillan Co., is a 
single volume of handsome typography, edited, with an 
introduction and memoir, by Mr. Walter S. Scott, and 
revised by Mr. George Sampson. There is a portrait 
and a reasonable supply of notes. 

" The Life of the Ancient Greeks," by Dr. Charles 
Burton Gulick, is a "Twentieth Century Text-Book " 
published by the Messrs. Appleton. The period con- 
cerned is that of the fifth and fourth centuries, and the 
material is drawn from many sources in general, and 
from the "Anabasis" in particular. 

" The Poems of John Keats " is a new volume in the 
"thin paper" editions of the poets imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner, and au addition to the " Caxton 
Series " of the same publishers is a pretty edition of 
Lodge's " Rosalind," which students of English litera- 
ture will find particularly acceptable. 

" Sartor Resartus," " On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and 
the Heroic in History," and " Past and Present " are 
usually reckoned as three volumes of Carlyle. The use 
of Oxford India paper makes it possible to get all 
three of them into a single volume, and a thin one at 
that. The Messrs. Scribner are the publishers. 

Mr. John Lane announces for early publication 
Emile Zola's last novel, "Truth," translated by Mr. 
E. A. Vizetelly. This is the third book in the series 
called by the author "The Four Evangelists," — of 
which the first two, " Labor " and " Fruitfulness," are 
already published, and the fourth (" Justice ") remains 
unwritten. 

" History for Graded and District Schools" (Ginn), 
by Mr. Ellwood Wadsworth Kemp, is a text-book in- 
tended to provide a framework for historical teaching 
during the first eight years of school life. It is an in- 
teresting experiment, and the chapters are carefully 
graded to the intelligence of the successive years for 
which they are designed. 

Among other important books to be issued during 
the early Spring season, Messrs. Houghton, MifSin & 
Co. announce Mr. J. T. Trowbridge's autobiography, 
"My Own Story"; Hon. John W. Foster's "American 
Diplomacy in the Orient"; a life of William Ellery 
Channing, by Rev. John W. Chad wick ; an extensive 
revision, in two volumes, of Prof. George E. Wood- 



berry's book on Poe, in the " American Men of Letters 
Series"; and, in the same series, a life of Whittier, by 
Prof. George R. Carpenter. 

" Loyal Traitors ; A Story of Friendship for the 
Filipinos," by Mr. Raymond L. Bridgman, will be pub- 
lished at once by the James H. West Co. of Boston. 
The book is said to make an effective presentation, in 
fiction form, of the Anti-Imperialist creed. 

The English " Who's Who" for 1903 comes to us 
from the Macmillan Co. It has fewer tables and more 
biographies than previous issues. But the selection of 
the few American names included is as capricious as 
ever, and does not seem amenable to any rational 
principle of choice. 

" A Manual of Zoology," published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co., is a translation, with some alterations, of 
Professor Richard Hertwig's well-known " Lehrbnch 
der Zoologie." The translator is Professor J. S. Kings- 
ley, and he has had the consent of the author for the 
numerous modifications of the original text that have 
been incorporated in this version. 

A " Guide to the Study and Use of Reference Books," 
by Miss Alice Bertha Kroeger, is published by Messrs. 
Houghton, Miftlin & Co. for the American Library 
Association. It belongs to the series of annotated 
bibliographies that the Association has of late under- 
taken to prepare, and that already includes Mr. J. N. 
Larned's work on " The Literature of American His- 
tory," besides a number of smaller works. 

First in the field with announcements for the forth- 
coming Spring publishing season is the Macmillan Co., 
whose sixty- four page list presents a bewildering array 
of interesting titles. Of especial note are the follow- 
ing : " A History of the Confederate War," by Mr. 
George Cary Eggleston ; " A History of the United 
States since the Civil War," by Mr. William Garrott 
Brown ; a volume of " Historical Lectures " by the late 
Lord Acton ; a collection of " Biographical Sketches " 
by Hon. James Bryce ; Sir Walter Besant's " London 
in the Eighteenth Century"; the first three volumes 
in a series on "The History of American Art," edited 
by Prof. John C. Van Dyke ; Mr. Stephen Phillips's 
new play, " David and Bathsheba"; the first instalment 
of " An Illustrated History of English Literature," by 
Dr. Richard Garnett and Mr. Edmund Gosse; and new 
books of fiction by Messrs. James Lane Allen, Winston 
Churchill, and Charles Major. 

Of especial interest to library workers will be the 
reprint, soon to be issued by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co., of Gabriel Naud^'s " Instructions concerning 
Erecting of a Library." This famous bit of biblioph- 
ilism was first published in Paris in 1627. Its author, 
distinguished no less for his knowledge of books than 
for his devotion to them, served as librarian to the 
Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin and Queen Christina 
of Sweden, among others, and was the founder of the 
fourth public library to be established in Europe. The 
translation to be given in the forthcoming reprint is 
that of John Evelyn — the only known English version. 
As one of the series of special editions produced at the 
Riverside Press, the volume will be wholly admirable 
in typography and general make-up. The text is 
printed on antique hand-made paper, from the " Brim- 
mer " type, set within rules throughout, with headings, 
initials, and tailpieces in red. Of the limited edition 
of four hundred and nineteen copies, four hundred are 
for sale.

WOLFSON'S ESSENTIALS 
IN ANCIENT HISTORY 

$1.50 

By ARTHUR MAYER WOLFSON, Ph.D., Assistant In 
History, De Witt Clinton High School, New York City 

'T^HIS convenient manual is the first to appear of a four- 
-■■ volume series prepared on the plan recommended by 
the Committee of Seven, and under the general editorship 
of Prof. Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard University. 
It is written in a manner both comprehensive and interest- 
ing to boys and girls, and contains work for one school 
year, each chapter being intended for a week's study. 

It has been prepared to fit students in Greek and 
Roman history for entrance to any college, and at the same 
time to meet every requirement of the Regents of New 
York State in ancient history. It furnishes a more consis- 
tent, continuous, and realistic presentation than is ordinarily 
given, and dwells only on the most important events. The 
book is unusually attractive, and contains a great amount of 
pedagogical apparatus for the needs of the teacher. The 
illustrations have been chosen primarily to explain the text. 
The maps are numerous and clear.

monotony — they appreciate the superior dining-car meals, " Santa Fe all the way."

Colonel John Gunby of the Maryland Line. 

Being Some Account of His Contributions to American Liberty. 

By A. A. OuNBY. 12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price, net, $1.00 ; 

delivered, $1.10. 

The research devoted to this tactical subject is bound to attract all 
impartial students of military history. 

The tenor and spirit of the book will be found most wholesome, 
broad and patriotic, and while depicting some of the most thrilling 
scenes of American history, it finds its best excuse for being written 
in the simple story of Freedom, which cannot be told too often nor 
dwelt on too long in these expanding times of our country. 

The Cause of the QIacial Period. 

Being a R^sum^ and Discussion of the Current Theories to Account 

for the Phenomena of the Drift ; with a New Theory by the Author. 

By H. L. Trub, M.D. 12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price, net, 

$1.00 ; delivered, $1.12. 

The Oiaciai Epoch remains the puzzle of the geologist; and so long 
as our knowledge of the causes that produced it continues so vague and 
unsatisfactory, any theory throwing new light on the subject should 
receive a candid investigation from scientists generally. Inasmuch as 
no satisfactory solution of the problem has, as yet, been furnished, the 
mystery surrounding the glacial period should insure a friendly attitude 
toward any publication purporting to give a further elucidation of the 
subject. 

Shakspeare's Art; or, Studies on the Master 
Builder of Ideal Characters. 

By Jahbs H. Cottbr, A.M. 12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Price, 

net, $1.00; delivered, $1.10. 

Bhahspeare^s Art; or, Studies on the Master Builder of Ideal 
Characters, by James H. Cotter, A.M., is a valuable addition to Shakes- 
pearean literature. Its style is florid and its periods poetical, yet rich 
in depth of thought, as well as in wealth of imagery. The illustrations 
are of prominent actors and actresses portraying Shakspearean char- 
acters in costume, and are excellent specimens of half-tone reproduc- 
tions. The author proves himself to be keen of observation as well as 
a philosopher, and bis deductions show him to be a deep student and 
an ardent admirer of the Bard of Avon.

The first part of the book contains the memoirs and letters from 
several prelates. The second part all the sermons and lectures that 
were found after his death. The third part contains the best articles 
written by him as editorials for the Catholic Tehgraph. Among these 
are the articles on Papal Infallibility, Galileo, the answer to Ingersoll 
on the Bible, and the letters written from various parts of Europe, in 
1880, whose graphic and beautiful descriptions of places and churches 
won the admiration of the readers of the Catholic Telegraph,

Personal Reminiscences of Prince Bismarcl<. By Sidxey Whitman, author of

postage, 16 cents additional. 

Mr. Whitman's distinction as a man of letters, a student of politics, and a man of affairs has enabled him to pi-ofit to 
the full by the opportunities afforded through his long friendship with Bismarck. For many years he knew the Iron 
Chancellor and visited him and enjoyed his confidences. The Bismarck literature which has been published in Germany 
has necessarily been subjected to much revision and editorship for political reasons. Mr. Whitman understood the policy, 
motives, and views of Bismarck as explained by himself, and his book affords a significant and intimate interpretation of 
the great statesman of a wholly personal character. There is history that is held in respect, but neglected, and history that 
is read. Whitman's " Personal Reminiscences of Prince Bismarck " represents the intimate history which holds the attention 
and is eagerly read.

Cloth, $1.25 net ; postage, 12 cents additional. 

" ' The Story of the Trapper ' as told by Miss A. C. Laut is more romantic than any tale of fiction. The author has 
brought to her work a remarkable knowledge of forest lore and something more than a mere acquaintance with the early 
history of this continent. In her hands the facts connected with the struggles of the pioneer traders are woven together 
with a deftness that makes a splendid record of adventure. It is seldom that any author succeeds so admirably in awaken-

Mr. Muir has put into an entertaining story the history of the occult science of alchemy, or the art of transmuting the

used by the gold makers as a sort of " black art."

Mr. Bullen has here written his first actual novel. The South Sea whaling fishery of New England is his theme. 
New pictures of that industry are presented. A love story beginning in Vermont is the thread on which are hung many 
stirring incidents. A rustic Yankee from the Green MountMn State is an interesting central figure.

Loyal Traitors 

A Story of Friendship for the Filipinos 



By RAYMOND L. BRIDGMAJS', author of "Ten Years of Massachosetts," 

Elections," "The Master Idea," etc. 



'Biennial 



'T'bs storj is one of quick and absorbing action from the first page to the last. Whether oae agnet or not with the 

writer's riewpoint, no reader can beg:in the book withont continQing interested to the end. If in ita dramatic 
repreeentations of deeds in the Philippines the stor; is, in a aenae, a terrible story, it is terrible only as " A Tale of 
Two Cities " or " Uncle Tom's Cabin " is terrible. With both of those stories it will perhaps not fail to be elaaaed. 

Some of the points made in the book are enforced by words of President Roosevelt. ex-Secretary Long, Rer. Dr. 
Lyman Abbott, Admiral Robley D. Erans, and others. The " qaotations " are not indicated, bat are left for 
readers to disooTer. 

The writer is no novice in literature. As bookmakar aad newspaper ouniiwdent he has already won reputa- 
tion. This new work reveals the force and pictoreaqaeaaM of loag tnuoiac. The aoldier, the deacon, the minister, 
the lawyer, the philosopher, the basiness man — all these characters in the story are faithful creations. The few 
quiet scenes of home and love in the United States are no leas vivid and trathfnl than the chapters having to do with 
events in the Philippines, depicdng battle, rescue, stmggle, tortma, — |ia, and defeat. 

Throughout the story, the eternal rightfulness of the Filipino eaase is affirmed, and every specious plea commonly 
urged for the course of the American Administration is shown to be untenable in the presence of true American 
principles, whose nltimate triumph is foreshadowed in the prophecy of freedom for the Philippines through the 
return of reason to the American people.

LEGISLATIOX FOE THE SCHOOLS 
OF CHICA GO. 

Once in two years the Legislatare of 
Illinois holds its stated session, and as often as 
this biennial event recnrs, a resolute endeavor 
is made by the friends of public education to 
secure a new school law in place of the anti- 
quated legislation that has held a place in the 
statute-book for many years. The existing law 
is hopelessly inadequate because it reflects only 
the educational demands of a full generation 
ago, and because it makes no special provision 
for the needs of a g^at city system like that 



of Chicago. Upon two past occasions we have 
chronicled the attempt to introduce system and 
efficiency by legislative enactment into the 
schools of Chicago, and in both cases the final 
entry of the record has been one of failure. 
The comprehensive measures proposed by 
Mayor Harrison's Educational Commission 
and by the Civic Federation of Chicago were 
both defeated by the customary appeals to pre- 
judice and selflsh interest, and two successive 
Legislatures have shown themselves incapable 
of rising to a great occasion and responding 
to an educational demand that expresses the 
best modem thought upon this supremely 
important subject. 

At the present time, a third attempt is being 
made to secure for the State of Illinois, and 
especially for the City of Chicago, a suitable 
statutory basis for the system of the public 
schools. The Civic Federation has presented 
to the Legislature a revised form of its meas- 
ure of two years ago, and the Chicago Board 
of Education has offered a measure of its own, 
less comprehensive, but not essentially different 
u far as the two measures cover the same 
ground. In one respect, the situation is ma- 
terially changed from what it was when the 
earlier attempts of this sort were made. During 
the past two or three years, the school author- 
ities of Chicago have, of their own initiative, 
put into operation many of the ideas for which 
educational reformers have been working of 
late, and the result has been a strengthening 
and quickening of the whole city system. This 
result, which would have been remarkable in 
any case, seems still more remarkable when 
we note that it has been accomplished in the 
face of revenue conditions of the most depress- 
ing sort. In spite of the utterly inadequate 
income of the last two years, the schools of 
Chicago have been in a healthier condition 
than ever before in their recent history, which 
fact oflFers a gratifying tribute to the wisdom 
of their management A high standard of 
requirement in teaching ability has been en- 
forced, political and personal influence in 
appointments has been minimized, many for- 
tunate economies have been practiced together 
with those which, though unfortunate, could 
not be avoided, and the educational force has 
been given permanency of tenure subject to

[Feb. 16, 



good behavior. This is only an outline of 
what has been accomplished ; the whole story 
would require many pages for its setting forth, 
and will constitute, when it comes to be told in 
detail, one of the most interesting chapters in 
the history of our city educational systems. 

The essential aim of the measures now pend- 
ing in the Illinois Legislature is to give the 
force of law to the reforms that have already 
thus approved themselves in practice. One 
might suppose that such a demand would only 
have to be made to be granted, but the forces 
of prejudice and selfish interest are, as usual, 
arrayed against it, and the outcome is more 
likely than not to be failure once more. An ag- 
gressive prejudice always has an undue effect 
upon legislative opinion, and one active oppo- 
nent of a proposed law has more influence upon 
its fortunes than a score of passive advocates. 
The present opposition seems to depend upon 
two main lines of argument. One of these is 
the utterly meaningless plea that the pro- 
posed measures violate the principle of home 
rule by transferring control of the Chicago 
schools to the government of the State. This 
is meaningless because, as every well-informed 
person knows, all authority in educational mat- 
ters rests with the State, and the only school 
law that Chicago can have must be a law of 
Illinois. The fact that so disingenuous an 
argument as this can be used at all shows to 
what straits the partisans of the old order are 
reduced. The other ground of opposition is 
found in the purpose of the proposed legislation 
to invest the executive head of the school sys- 
tem with enlarged powers and responsibilities. 
This objection may possibly amount to some- 
thing, although the measures now under dis- 
cussion do no more than confirm a practice that 
has been found to work admirably for some 
time past. No doubt there can be such a thing 
as too great a concentration of power in the 
hands of a superintendent, and any plan hav- 
ing this end in view must be judged, not in 
the light of its workings at any given time, but 
in the light of its extreme possibilities under 
other conditions. A law which would produce 
excellent results when administered by a wise 
and tactful officer might conceivably produce 
very bad results when administered by an un- 
balanced and capricious executive. But the 
methods and the language employed to voice 
this view in the present instance are not of a 
nature to inspire confidence in the objectors, 
and a careful examination of the measures un- 
der debate seems to show that sufficient safe- 



guards against unjust and arbitrary action are 
provided. If not, these safeguards may easily 
be strengthened without impairing the essen- 
tial character of the proposed legislation. 

With possibly a few slight modifications, we 
believe that the passage of either of the meas- 
ures now so hotly debated would be for the best 
interests of the Chicago schools. And yet the 
advance which the enactment of such legisla- 
tion would mark would by no means justify the 
friends of educational progress in resting on 
their oars and considering their work accom- 
plished. A thoroughly satisfactory school law 
must go beyond what is now being attempted, 
and make the profession of teaching one which 
shall be comparable with the other professions 
in attractiveness. The aims of the legislation 
now under debate are essentially three in num- 
ber : expert control by responsible officers hav- 
ing a definite legal status, the merit system in 
appointment and promotion, and permanency 
of tenure after the necessary time of probation. 
So far, so good, but there are three other 
things that should also be secured. The 
teacher's tenure of office must be safeguarded 
not merely by doing away with the form of 
annual reelections, but by an emphatic statu- 
tory declaration that nothing but professional 
inefficiency or personal immorality shall consti- 
tute a valid cause for dismissal. Until this prin- 
ciple is given the force of law, school authorities 
in one place or another will be found making 
marriage, or non-residence, or some other mat- 
ter utterly irrelevant to educational efficiency, 
a sufficient ground for dismissal, and just as 
long as these petty interferences with personal 
freedom are possible the best men and women 
will shun the profession and its whole standard 
will be lowered. The second thing to be se- 
cured by an adequate school law is a minimum 
scale of salaries, and a provision for guaran- 
teeing their payment irrespective of fluctuations 
in the revenue. In this matter, the State of 
New York has done worthy pioneer work, and 
its statute upon this subject might well be 
taken as a model for other commonwealths. 
The third requirement of an ideal school law 
must be a provision for pensions after a quarter- 
century or more of service. Such provision 
for the old age of the public teacher is to be 
regarded not as a charity but as a right — as a 
part of his just compensation for a life of de- 
votion to the public good. We could wish, 
indeed, that the three purposes above specified 
might have been made a part of the legislation 
now proposed, but the fact that they are not

rejecting the measures, in the main so admir- 
able, that are now before the Legislature of 
Illinois. We trust that this body will prove 
wiser than its predecessors, and earn for itself 
the gratitude of all friends of educational pro-

question of public education. 



FOE'S PLACE AS A CRITIC. 



In the world's literature there are only two 
absolutely great critics — Aristotle and Lessing. 
The " Poetics " of the one and the " LaocoOa " and 
" Dramaturgerie " of the other are the fountains at 
which all secondary critics must fill their pitchers. 
Aristotle is limited in certain directions by a lack 
of material to work upon ; and, similarly, Lessing 
is circumscribed by dealing too exclusively with 
Latin and French authors. But they have the 
genius of divination, and their work is final. 
Amongst the ancients, Longinas was an inspired 
appreciator. He felt so fully the greatness and 
charm of literature that he communicates a like 
thrill and fervor to his readers. He is exalting and 
stimulating to the last degree. But except a few 
oracular utterances about style, and some dry re- 
marks on grammatical forms, he gives us no infor- 
mation as to the underlying principles of art. 
English literature can boast of a long succession of 
critics only inferior to the great Greek and Ger- 
man — giant planets to that double sun. Dryden, 
Johnson, Coleridge, Hazlitt, Arnold, Lowell, — 
these and others have left us a body of criticism 
more varied and weighty than any other modern 
nation, save Germany, possesses. Does Poe de- 
serve to rank with these men ? 

Poe unquestionably performed one of the most 
diflBcnlt feats of criticism. With almost unerring 
instinct, he separated the wheat from the chaff of 
his contemporary literature. Hawthorne, Dickens, 
Tennyson, Mrs. Browning, and others, received from 
him some of their earliest and most valuable ap- 
preciation. If he erred, it was on the side of 
enthusiasm. His position was analogous to that of 
an expert in precious stones, who can pick out by 
instinct the real and perfect gems from a mass of 
flawed stones or paste imitations. But such an 
expert is not necessarily a practised mineralogist 
or chemist, acquainted with the composition of 
minerals and capable of reproducing them in the 
laboratory. And the literature which Poe practised 
upon is certainly not of the first importance. His 
few casual utterances about really great books are 
wrong. His attempts to postulate principles of 
poetry are ludicrously wrong. 

It is unpleasant to have to act as Devil's Advo- 
cate toward a writer whom one loves and reveres, — 



but the truth is best. Poe's psendo-poetic principles 
have had a great influence, and one decidedly de- 
trimental to the development of the best and great- 
est in literature. It is worth while, therefore, to 
examine some of them. 

One of his most elaborate, and, in a way, bril- 
liant, articles is that on " The Rationale of Verse." 
It is logically argued, and if its premise were sound 
it would be a valuable little treatise on versification. 
Bat it is vitiated by the assumption that English 
verse is founded on quantity. Poe's master, Cole- 
ridge, knew better, and when he was casting around 
for a method of formalizing verse he bit upon the 
metre of " Christabel." This is simply accentuation 
systematized. — the four beats or points of em- 
phasis in each line answering the purpose of a suc- 
cession of quantitative feet. It would be a hard thing 
to say that there is no quantity in English poetry, — 
but it certainly does not perform the office that Poe 
imagined it did. I doubt whether any great En- 
glish poet ever thought of quantity when writing 
his lines, or, save in exceptional cases, scanned them 
after they were written. It is only by the most forced 
construction and conventional application of the rules 
of prosody that the ordinary iambic line — the most 
natural to our language — can be made to scan — 

" Lad; I you are { the crS | Slist she | alive." 
There is a typical line of blank verse, and unless 
I am greatly mistaken it is composed of four 
spondees, with an anapest, — truly a curious iambic 
measure. But even when you have got an approxi- 
mation to your iambic line (it is trochaic really) 
" Not in I lone splSn \ dor hung- | aloft | the n%ht," 

you can alter every quantity and the line will run 
just as well, — e. g. (my amendment of course not 
being intended to make sense). 

See there | dim bean | ty gleam | ing on { the sky. 
Poe was a great lyric metrist, but the beauty of his 
verse is largely due to his marvellous caprices and 
daring feats of accentuation. Scanned by a master 
of Latin prosody, his verse would look queer indeed. 
In justice to Poe, I would say that if the quanti- 
tative system is untenable the theory of accented 
and unaccented syllables disposed in feet after the 
classic fashion is equally so. There are lines, mainly 
monosyllabic, where every syllable is accented, 
which would give ten feet to a line of heroic verse. 
And there are other lines where polysyllables are 
crowded so closely together that there are only four, 
three, or may be two accents in the verse. This 
last statement may be doubted, so I will give an 
example, and it is easier to make than to find one : 

Euripides, the Eleusinian. 

Here the is certainly not accented and the other two 
words have the normal accent on the antepenulti- 
mate and no others that I can detect. The ac- 
cents are fixed in the metre of " Christabel," but in 
no other English metre known to me. 

Poe's most famous critical dictum is the one 
which asserts that in the nature of things there can

be no long poem, — that a work of poetic art, to 
prodace the proper effect, mast be capable of being 
read at a single sitting. There is a delightful un- 
certainty about this. What is a long poem? and 
how many minutes or hours may a sitting last? 
There is nothing in the world to prevent one from 
reading " Paradise Lost " at a sitting, if one wants 
to ; and the " Iliad " is a baby among epics com- 
pared with the " Shah Namah." But Poe evidently 
intended to set up as his standard of the short 
poem, the ballad or lyric. There would be a slight 
measure of truth in his assertion, if the whole effect 
of a work of literary art were confined to the first 
instantaneous, momentary shock, — if we were then 
to forget the piece and never read it again. But a 
poem worth reading at all is worth reading many 
times, and our minds are not so feeble that we can- 
not carry the impression on from time to time. In 
reading a long poem, our pleasure is, in great part, 
cumulative; we can look before and after, and de- 
tect those leit-motifs — to borrow a phrase from a 
sister art — which consolidate the work together. 
No one questions the unity of impression produced 
by a long novel — " Don Quixote," for instance, — 
though nobody may read it at a single sitting : why, 
then, should we doubt that a poem or a play may 
be as much or more concentrate. Bat the mere 
statement of Poe's theory is an exhibition of its 
absurdity. It rules out of art all the great poetic 
creators, — Homer, .^schylus, Dante, Shakespeare, 
— and leaves the field to the lyrists and ballad-mon- 
gers. The common-sense of mankind would reject 
such a preposterous conclusion, were it backed by 
an authority ten times as potent as Poe's. And the 
greatest authority of all, Aristotle, specifically de- 
manded " a certain magnitude " as a condition of 
greatness in a work of literature. The lilt of the 
thrush and the blossoming of the rose have their 
place in nature, — but so have the mighty foldings 
of the mountains, and the wheelings, cycle upon 
cycle, of planets and suns. If Poe had merely as- 
serted that the ordinary average human intellect is 
only capable of assimilating brief impressions of 
greatness or beauty, he would have been right 
enough. Bat that is the fault of the ordinary 
average intellect ; and it has nothing to do with 
the comparative greatness or value of works of art. 
Again and again Poe asserted that beauty was 
the sole province and object of poetry. It is true 
that he sometimes qualified his axiom by admitting 
that a certain strangeness was a necessary ingre- 
dient of beauty. But he could not or did not rec- 
ognize that the deities who preside over poetry are 
twin, — one female. Beauty, — the other, male. 
Power, Greatness, Sublimity. It is carious that 
his own work is lacking in just the quality he 
deemed all-important — beauty. Even in diction, 
his phrase has seldom the perfect grace and haunt- 
ing charm and massy weight which are almost 
habitual with Keats and Coleridge and Tennyson, 
and of which Wordsworth and Arnold and Emerson 
have such frequent use. The lines " To Helen," 



" The Haunted Palace," some phrases from " Isra- 
fel," and this, from " To One in Paradise," — 
" No more, no more, no more 

Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree. 

Or the stricken eagle soar," — 

are almost all that occur to me of weight and 
magnificence in his expression. He got his effects 
by wholes rather than details, and by music rather 
than phrase. When it comes to the matter of Poe's 
work, — his conception and design, whether in 
prose or verse, — beauty is conspicuous by its total 
absence. What beauty, in any sane use of the 
word, can there be in the horrors and glooms, the 
Rembrandt-like chiaro-oscuro, of the confined 
charnel-houses, or vast illimitable spaces which 
Poe's imagination created and peopled ? But there 
is immense sublimity. Poe is the most sublime 
poet since Milton. Sublimity stirs even in his 
most grotesque and fanciful sketch, — like Milton's 
lion " pawing to get free his hinder parts." It 
rears full-fronted in the concluding pages of " The 
Narrative of A. Gordon Pym," — in the sentences 
which describe the enormous balk and battle- 
lanterns of the ever-living ship in " The MSS. 
Found in a Bottle." It is predominant in the 
mighty sweep, the ordered disorder, of '< The De- 
scent into the Maelstrom." It thrills us in the 
many-colored chambers of " The Masque of the 
Red Death." It overwhelms us with horror in 
" The Murders of the Rue Morgue." It is solemn 
and awe-inspiring in " Berenice," " Legeia," and 
" The Fall of the House of Usher,"— in " Ulalame " 
and "The Raven." Metaphysic, which Poe de- 
rided, — the great problems of life, death, and 
the universe, wherein sublimity most resides, — 
haunted his mind continuously. He reaches his 
climax of almost too profound thought in the 
colloquy of " Monas and Una," " The Power of 
Words," and " Eureka." No poet has so continu- 
ously tried to outreach the possibilities of human 
experience ; none has so assiduously avoided the 
ordinary facts of human life. His sublimity ac- 
counts for his fate with the American public. A 
true democracy, it abhors greatness and ridicules 
sublimity. Yet Poe fascinates it with antipathic 
attraction. It follows him very much as Sancho 
Panza flounders after Don Quixote. 

In spite of its sublimity, Poe's theatre of tragic 
abstractions is of coarse inferior to the flesh-and- 
blood theatre of the gfreat creators. They include 
him, — they are as high as he, and they have 
many times his breadth and weight. But he is 
very great even in his one-sidedness — his silhou- 
ettedness. One-sidedness may indeed make an 
artist more intense and effective. Bat it is a 
crime in a critic. Despite bis fine instinct for 
what was good, Poe had not the breadth of view 
or the knowledge necessary for a great critic. It 
is better that a critic should err in judgment in a 
concrete case than that he should lay down princi- 
ples which are provably wrong.

IiiTBRART Essays of a Naturalist.* 

Mr. John Burroughs has given us no more 
delightful revelation of himself than in the 
volume of eighteen essays which he names, 
from the opening chapter, " Literary Values." 
Many of the essays, perhaps all, have seen the 
light in magazines ; but their appearance in 
book form is none the less welcome. It has 
been said of a certain living author that he has 
the best style in literature to-day because one 
can read page after page of his writing without 
being conscious of reading at all ; it is pure 
expression, offering no resistance. These words 
of praise, as quoted by Mr. Burroughs himself, 
apply to his own literary style. It is the best 
possible style, because it is the man. 

In one of Lamb's letters, written in later 
life, he says he has ceased to care much for 
books, except books about books. Mr. Bur- 
roughs, as the years go by, finds in himself a 
contrary inclination. Books about real life in- 
terest him far more than works that are the 
result merely of the friction of the mind upon 
other literature. And who will not agree with 
him? Nevertheless he writes as engagingly 
about " Mere Literature " as about the robin 
and the squirrel and the honey-bee; and the 
more we read the more the wonder grows 
that a man who has accomplished so much in 
nature-study has found time to read so widely 
and to digest so thoroughly what he has read. 
The reviewer is tempted, in the enthusiasm of 
the moment, to make his notice of this volume 
consist wholly of ample quotations ; but that 
would be an injury to those having the reading 
of the book still in prospect. So he refrains 
from skimming the cream, lest the process 
should empty the milk-pan. A few matters 
only, out of so much that is suggestive, may 
be touched upon, either for the sake of hearty 
commendation or of mild dissent. 

Literary criticism the author classes with 
creative literature. Its value as a guide to the 
reader he regards as subordinate to the intel- 
lectual and emotional pleasure and stimulus it 
affords. " Reduce criticism to a science," he 
says, " or eliminate the element of impression- 
ism, and the result is no longer literature. 
The reason may be convinced, but the emotions 
are untouched. ' The "personal equation" he 

•LiTKBABT Values, and Other Papers. By John Bur- 
ronghs. Boeton : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



looks upon as the vital element in work of this 
sort. Hence, he adds, " the secret of the 
greater interest we take in signed criticism 
over unsigned." In another chapter, however, 
one notes with approval the warning given by 
the sharp-eyed, truth-loving nature-student 
against " that literary cast of mind that prefers 
a picturesque statement to the exact fact." We 
find the personal element in Dr. Johnson's con- 
fident assertion that the swallow passes the 
winter in the mud, " conglobulated into a ball"; 
but the untruth of such writing spoils it even 
as literature. 

In the chapter on " Style and the Man," 
Mr. Burroughs finds much of the secret of a 
good style in the elimination of friction ; 
which recalls Mr. Spencer's " economy of at- 
tention," both friction and attention having 
reference, of course, to the reading, not to the 
writing. Let the author speak for himself : 

*' How little friction the mind encounters in Addison, 
in Lamb, or in the best of our own prose writers; and 
how much in Meredith, and the later writings of Henry 
James! Is not friction to be got rid of as far as possible 
in all departments of life? One does not want his shoes 
to pinch, nor his coat to bind, neither does he want to 
waste any strength on involved sentences or on cryptic 
language. Did you ever try to row a boat in water 
in which lay a sodden fleece of newly fallen snow? I 
find the reading of certain books like that. Some of 
Browning's poems impede my mind in that way." 

On another page he says the obscurities and 
affectations of certain recent English poets 
and novelists are sure to drag them down, and 
that Browning, " with his sudden leaps and 
stops, and all that Italian rubbish, is fearfully 
handicapped." Yet it must be added that 
other passages in the book seem to mark Mr. 
Burroughs a lover of Browning. Quoting 
Mr. Spencer's advice to cultivate a variety of 
styles in writing, the author protests that such 
a course would produce a Jack-of-all-styles and 
master of none, and maintains that one specific 
style should be practiced. Now, however true 
that a conscious aiming at variety too often 
produces an unpleasing patchwork, yet the 
master can and does vary his style with his 
theme. The Dickens of " The Pickwick Pa- 
pers " is not exactly the Dickens of " A Child's 
History of England," nor the latter the Dickens 
of "American Notes." How many journalists, 
too, write acceptably in different styles for 
different papers. Probably the author's real 
objection is to the mixing of styles in the same 
article or book ; for he himself well says in 
summing up the whole matter : 

"Id treating of nature or outdoor themes, let the 



114

style have limpidness, sweetness, freshness; in criticism 
let it have dignity, lucidity, penetration ; in history let 
it have mass, sweep, comprehension; in all things let it 
have vitality, sincerity, genuineness." 

Among the chapters on subjects not strictly 
literary, those on Gilbert White and Thoreau 
deserve especial mention — if one may make 
distinctions where all is excellent. It is inter- 
esting to contrast with this breezy little sketch 
by a naturalist on " Thoreau's Wildness " the 
highly wrought essay on Thoreau by the book- 
man Lowell. To the latter Thoreau was. one 
of the " pistillate plants kindled to fruitage by 
the Emersonian pollen," and the whole paper 
is full of pretty conceits and bookish allusions, 
containing much more of Lowell and his library 
than of Thoreau. But not thus are we teased 
and tantalized by Mr. Burroughs ; he goes 
straight to the mark. Again in the last two 
chapters, " The Spell of the Past " and " The 
Secret of Happiness," he breaks away from 
literature and leaves the reader undecided 
whether the author is more delightful when 
discoursing on life and the world of the senses, 
or when treating of books and the world of 
the imagination. 

Whatever his subject, the naturalist peeps 
forth in word or metaphor here and there ; 
and this self-betrayal is as pleasing in its pic- 
turesque results as it is inevitable. For in- 
stance, writing of Whitman, he says that " he 
elaborates the least and gives us in profusion 
the buds and germs of poetry." Sainte-Beuve 
is styled " not a profound or original mind, but 
a wonderfully flexible, tolerant, sympathetic, 
engaging one ; a climbing plant, one might 
say, that needed some support to display itself 
to the best advantage." Poetry is " a breeze 
touched with a wild perfume from field and 
wood." In regard to a man's literary likings, 
" something as subtle and vital and hard to 
analyze as the flavor of a fruit, and analogous 
to it, makes him prefer this poet to that." Of 
the styles of two diflferent writers, " in the one 
case the sentences are artificial ; in the other 
they bud and sprout out of the man himself 
as naturally as the plants and trees out of 
the soil." Shakespeare " has been the host of 
more literary parasites probably than any 
other name in history." The stylist, we read, 
" cultivates words as a florist cultivates flow- 
ers." So one might go on with instances of 
the botanical and horticultural flavor that per- 
vades the book, but nowhere to excess. One 
expression, however, this time drawn from 
mathematics, is less pleasing. It is " personal 



equation," and it occurs repeatedly. An equa- 
tion is the expression of equality between two 
terms, and why the bias of a man's mind should 
be called an equation is a puzzle. The usage 
is as common as it is indefensible, but Mr. 
Burroughs's employment of the term is the 
more striking because his genius is so far 
mathematical that we find him, in this very 
book, capable of the following : " We may com- 
plete a circle from a small segment of it. If 
we have two sides of a triangle, we may add 
the third. To find the value of an unknown 
quantity, we must have a complete equation 
and as many equations as we have unknown 
quantities." It is a small matter, but one re- 
grets to see a writer whose language charms 
by its vitality and apt significance, adopt a 
conventional term that is worse than mean- 
ingless. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Scottish Gow^rie Mystery.* 

In attempting to unravel theGowrie Mystery 
and the Treason of Logan of Restalrig, Mr, 
Lang is clearly conscious that he is undertak- 
ing tasks which would try the talents of Sher- 
lock Holmes and Mr. Allen Pinkerton, for he 
makes appreciative allusions to these distin- 
guished detectives. It is a long and fascinat- 
ing chase on which the reader is asked to 
accompany the author ; more than once our 
steed balks at critical stumps as well as at 
shadowy conjectures. It is the student of myth 
and legend and the potential novelist, rather 
than the historical philosopher, whom we are 
following. But who is not charmed by a mys- 
tery? And who will not gladly spend an even- 
ing pursuing one to its source, especially if it 
is a dark and desperate Scotch mystery ? 

On the 5th of August, 1600, John, Earl of 
Gowrie, and his brother, Alexander Ruthven, 
were slain in the house of the former, Gowrie 
House in Perth, by certain nobles in the suite 
of King James VI. of Scotland. The king 
and his party claimed that this was done to 
defend the king from a murder attempted by 
Ruthven. The kinsmen of the Ruthvens, and 
the Kirk in general, maintained that it was 
murder by the king's command, either as the 
result of a brawl or of deliberate plan. Lack 
of adequate motive has been the chief obstacle 
hitherto to accepting either account. As to 
weighing of evidence, — on the one hand is the

fact that the testimony at the official hearing 
was almost all corroborative of the king's ac- 
count ; on the other hand is the fact that it 
was given under torture, and that " his Maj- 
esty's word was not to be relied on." After 
the introduction of much new and important 
evidence and very acute sifting of the old, 
Mr. Lang arrives at the conclusion that the 
king's account is in the main true, but that 
Gowrie and Ruthven intended only to capture, 
not to murder, their victim. He is not led to 
this conclusion by " any sentiment for that un- 
sentimental Prince, ' gentle King .Jamie,' for 
he was not the man to tell the truth ' if he 
could think of anything better,' " but by the 
balancing of probabilities. It is interesting 
to note that this conclusion is essentially the 
same as that of Sir Walter Scott in his '■ Tales 
of a Grandfather." 

Mr. Lang's arguments are in brief as fol- 
lows : The king had no reason for wishing to 
put the brothers out of the way, the only mo- 
tive suggested, jealousy of Queen Anne and 
Gowrie, being without plausible evidence. And 
even if he had reasons, he would not have re- 
sorted to so uncertain and crude a method of 
accomplishing his end. Moreover, the king's 
story of the affair, though hard to believe, is 
consistent with the accounts of all the other 
witnesses, and was maintained by him unaltered 
through much hostile cross-questioning on the 
part of ministers of the Kirk. Finally, the the- 
ory of a conspiracy against the king is supported 
by the (recently discovered) letters of Logan 
of Restalrig. On the other hand, Gowrie may 
have laid the execution of his father to James, 
and he may have had other grievances ; again, he 
may have been influenced by Francis Bothwell 
and others to wish to hold and control the king 
for political reasons, — an experiment that had 
been made more than once before with James 
and his mother, Mary Stuart. The reasons that 
are urged against the probability of Gowrie's 
undertaking to murder the king do not hold 
against an attempt of this latter sort. Finally, 
the case for the Ruthvens is greatly weakened 
by the contemporary Vindication of the Ruth- 
vens, a document recently discovered by Mr. 
Lang. This Vindication, presumably the best 
that could be made while the sources of infor- 
mation were still fresh and open, is shown to 
be *' conspicuously mendacious." " The value 
of the Apology is to show how very poor a case 
was the best that the vindicator of the Ruthvens 
was able to produce.' 

One piece of evidence, to which Mr. Lang 



attaches some value, he has not examined with 
the same critical eyes that have looked through 
the mazes of the contemporary testimony. This 
is the coat-of-arms devised by the Earl of 
Gowrie while a student at Padua, which is 
honored by reproduction in colors as front- 
ispiece to the volume under consideration. 
The supposed signifieanoe of this coat-of-arms 
lies in the addition to the family design of a 
mailed knight pointing at a crown and utter- 
ing the motto " Tibi Soli." This is interpreted 
as conclusive evidence of designs upon the 
government on the part of Gowrie ; the knight, 
representing Gowrie, being supposed to say 
" For thee alone " to himself and with appli- 
cation to the crown. But aside from the post 
factx> rumors that Gowrie had such ambitions, 
is not the first and most natural interpretation 
of that motto, as the hand, or sword, points at 
the crown, " I serve thee alone," that is, the 
King, whom the crown represents ? At least, 
this interpretation is not so improbable that 
Mr. Lang is warranted in exclaiming, " What 
other sense can the emblem bear ? " that is, 
what other sense than, " The crown is for thee 
alone." In fact, would not this sense be 
better expressed by " Mihi Soli " ? 

In 1608 one Sprot, a notary, was arrested 
on the charge of treasonable foreknowledge of 
the Gowrie plot and confessed the same under 
torture, admitting that he had possessed letters 
from Logan of Restalrig to Gowrie and others 
confirming the theory of the plot against the 
king and involving Logan in the plot. These 
letters were found on Sprot's person when he 
was arrested. Later in his trial he declared 
that the letters were forgeries. Still later he 
declared that there had, however, been one 
genuine letter from Logan, from which he 
quoted. None of the letters were introduced 
for examination in the trial, but on Sprot's 
confession of guilt he was executed. Logan 
bad taken the precaution to die two years 
earlier ; but government, following a pretty 
custom of the olden time, had his body ex- 
humed and condemned and his children for- 
feited of their estates. At this posthnmons 
trial the letters were put in evidence, Sprot's 
declaration that they were forgeries being 
suppressed. " Sprot, under examination, lied 
often, lied variously, and, perhaps, lied to the 
last ": hence without the letters Logan could 
scarcely have been found guilty. 

With the assistance of various experts Mr. 
Lang has examined these letters, still preserved 
in the General Register House at Edinburgh,

and concludes that they are all forgeries as to 
the writing, but that one of them, the most 
important and detailed of all, the one addressed 
to Gowrie, bears internal evidence of being 
genuine. The others, Mr. Lang concludes 
very plausibly, were constructed upon this as 
a basis. But it must be conceded that the 
evidence aside from that of the perjurer 
Sprot against Logan as author of an original 
letter, is very slender. In substance, it is, 
that the character revealed in the letter fits in 
with what we know of Logan, while it is quite 
too real a revelation of character to have been 
invented by the scribbler Sprot. Yet, aside 
from this letter, there is no direct evidence 
whatever connecting Logan with the Gowrie 
plot. He does not seem to have been under 
suspicion at the time. Only the fact of his 
selling all his property soon after the Gowrie 
affair, and later leaving the country, seems to 
show that he had a bad conscience and felt 
himself to be in danger. Slender as this 
evidence is, and frankly as Mr. Lang admits 
its inconclusiveness, we are inclined to agree 
with him that the probability is strongly for 
Logan's authorship of an original letter to 
Gowrie, which Sprot may have copied. 

It is curious that Mr. Lang should hold 
(p. 238) to the possibility of the letter being in 
Logan's hand. " It may be a Sprot after 
Logan." The facsimiles of Logan's hand- 
writing, of Sprot's, and of the forged letter, 
show clearly enough that the forged letter is 
not in Logan's hand. It has peculiarities, no- 
tably the abbreviation for " and," which are 
not found at all in the genuine Logan writing, 
and, indeed, but scantly, and not quite identi- 
cal in shape, in the genuine Sprot writing. 
The forged letter may be in Sprot's hand ; it 
is certainly not in Logan's. 

The case stands thus: If we accept the es- 
sential authenticity of the Logan letter ("No. 
IV."), then the Gowrie plot against King 
James (not to kill, but to capture him) is proved 
beyond any doubt ; but if we reject the Logan 
letter as a baseless forgery, still the remaining 
evidence is strongly for the plot on the part of 
the Gowries against the king. 

Here, as in the author's " Mary Stuart and 
the Casket Letters," we have to do with by- 
products of his " History of Scotland." Yet 
there is a charm in being admitted to the art- 
ist's workshop and taken into his confidence, — 
in discussing with him, as it were, the pros and 
CO/18 of his final decisions. Perhaps this famil- 
iarity renders the historian's utterances some- 



what less authoritative for us; but it certainly 
increases our respect for his honesty and sm- 
cerity. Garrulity is to be expected under the 
circumstances, and of much repetition we are 
forewarned by the author. A few Gallicisms 
may be charged off against the many debts we 
owe Mr. Lang. " To give upon " (of a door) 
is a favorite phrase of his ; but " to have nothing 
to make with," (i. e. have nothing to do with), 
is carrying us too far out upon the Channel. 

Photogravure portraits of King James and 
Queen Anne, together with the colored plate 
of the Gowrie arms and several fine half-tones,, 
add to the attractiveness of the book, and, on 
occasion, to the clearness of the reader's under- 
standing. ^_ jj_ Carkuth. 



FrrxY Years of the American Stage.* 

An autobiography of the oldest living me- 
tropolitan actor, relating in modest and ex- 
pressive language numerous incidents and 
events that have had no small part in the for- 
mation of our American drama, is an invaluable 
acquisition to theatrical literature. Mr. James 
H. Stoddart has been identified with the 
American stage for upwards of fifty years, 
appearing first in New York, September 7, 
1854, at Wallack's Theatre. During the long 
period there has been scarcely an actor or 
actress of note with whom he has not been 
associated, and of whom he has not some an- 
ecdote to relate with droll humor, in his care- 
fully written " Recollections of the American 
Stage." It is interesting to note that, at a 
time of life when the average man, in a simple 
spirit of submission, looks upon life's work as 
ended, Mr. Stoddart's indomitable energy — 
frequently a characteristic of Scotch ancestry — 
still keeps awake his interest in the " tinselled 
life " of the stage, and his charming personal- 
ity aids him in extracting a caltn philosophical 
pleasure from the very shams and follies 
against which in his early days he had so 
stoutly battled. To understand fully the ca- 
reer of any person who has exerted a marked 
influence upon his times, it is necessary to 
understand the circumstances and conditions 
which have made his career and influence pos- 
sible. 

Mr. Stoddart was born in the town of Black 
Barnsley, Yorkshire, England, October 13,

1827. His parents were theatrical people, 
and at five years of age he made his first ap- 
pearance on the stage as Martin Haywood in 
Douglas Jerrold's drama of " The Rent Day,'" 
and for years afterwards he wandered with his 
parents through the small English towns, en- 
countering the ups and downs of life — "being 
far oftener down than up." He recalls many 
peculiar incidents of those early days in En- 
gland and Scotland, during which time it was 
his good fortune to play with Macready, 
Helen Faucit, Charlotte Cnshman. Kean, 
Charles Mathews, and other celebrities. In 
August, 1864, he reached America, and the 
following month joined the company of James 
W. Wallack at the munificent salary of fifteen 
dollars a week. Quite naturally, he in time 
became associated with all the favorites of 
" the old school " of actors. He looks upon 
Edwin Booth as the most gentle, unassuming, 
unostentatious man he ever met. Comparing 
the early days with the new order of things, 
Mr. Stoddart says : 

" The attention given to production is now so infi- 
nitely more careful and thorough than in the old dars 
as to admit of no comparison. The same old stock 
scenery, formerly used year after year, would be looked 
upon as a very poor apology for the manner in which 
plays are now put upon the stage. The same advance- 
ment applies to incidental music, and in fact to all the 
details connected with the conduct of the theatre. To 
those, however, entering the theatrical profession with 
the idea of making it their life work, I say that I think 
the old system immeasurably better than that of the 
present time. As in all occupations it is well to be 
grounded in the rudimental portions of the work, so no 
less does this rule apply to the theatrical profession. 
There was no royal road to position in the old days, 
but most people bad to commence at the bottom of the 
ladder and ascend it gradually, the goal being its top. 
And if one never climbed very high, yet the very strife 
&nd endeavor of itself gave to him that repose, that 
ease of deportment, which I think quite essential in 
the actor. Such discipline was formerly deemed neces- 
sary, and if, after submitting to it, one was not found 
particularly brilliant, one was at least experienced, 
which means much." 

Mr. Stoddart reviews at length the many parts 
he has played in successful metropolitan pro- 
ductions, — parts that have gained for him a 
most enviable position in the theatrical world, 
both as a man and as an artist. 

The volume is happily illustrated with many 
old portraits and reproductions of rare old 
play-bills. In a prefatory note by Mr. William 
Winter, the venerable critic sums up the ac- 
tor's career in the following words : 

"Greatness in dramatic art, meaning the summit of 
excellence in interpretative expression, is simplicity, 
and of simplicity Mr. Stoddart possesses the absolute 



command, tonehiog equally the springs of homor and 
pathos, winning affection as well as admiraUon and 
thus fulfilling the best purpose of all art, which is to 
bless human life with the gracious memory that makes 
it calm and the noble incentive that makes it beautifuL"

COXSTABLK AND HIS INFLUENCE.* 

It is manifestly impossible in a brief review 
to give anything like a comprehensive resume 
of a work that comprises a hundred thousand 
very carefully considered words, more espe- 
cially when the work is critical in its purpose, 
and in almost every paragraph carries sugges- 
tions that might without forcing be extended 
to the prescribed limits of the review. In con- 
sidering Mr. C. J. Holmes's elaborate critical 
study of "Constable and his Influence on 
LandscapePainting,"no more will be attempted 
than the giving of such impressions as stand 
oat most sharply distinct from among the 
many received from the work. 

A book about an artist and his work must 
be addressed to those who read about art rather 
than to those who produce it, — that is, to those 
whose interest in art is chiefly intellectual, 
and who do not concern themselves primarily 
with how the thing is done. It seems neces- 
sary, then, first to place the individual and the 
art in question so that they may be viewed in 
their true perspective ; for it is the first re- 
quirement of the mind that what is offered for 
its consideration should be presented in the 
scale and proportion that belong to it as the 
part of a scheme or growth, rather than as 
something detached and specific, and deriving 
only from itself. 

Individual gift and environment have no 
doubt a larger share in determining what a 
landscape painter does, than is the case with 
other painters ; yet even here, and with a gen- 
ius so profoundly original as the one in ques- 
tion, to consider the individual as though he 
were entirely responsible for himself would be 
to give but a poor account of him. So, before 
showing what John Constable's art owes to 
John Constable, Mr. Holmes shows what it 
owes to those who, before him, had tried in 
this way to give out their consciousness of earth 
and sky. This portion of the book, in which 
the author reviews landscape art from its be- 
ginnings in the Italian soil to this particularly

vigorous flowering in the less genial English 
air, must he regarded as a singularly valuable 
contribution to the literature of art. He points 
out the essentially subsidiary and decorative 
purpose with which Raphael, Da Vinci, Titian, 
and the rest of their great company, painted 
trees and fields and skies. Considering the 
art organically, and as a development, while 
yet allowing for temperament, environment, 
and all else in the individual that has varied 
the type, he follows it through Rubens's fluent 
and masterly conventions, through the silvery 
distances of Claude, through Poussin, Cuyp, 
Holbein, and Ruysdael, down to the time when, 
no longer a tradition more or less well seasoned 
with some salt of personal sentiment, no more 
a servant to some artistic purpose other than 
its own, it at last found in Nature itself a com- 
plete reason. 

As the writer's purpose concerns the artist 
rather than the man, but little is told us re- 
garding Constable's personal history. Enough 
is given, however, to impart a certain pleasant 
warmth to our interest in his art, which is 
placed against a lightly-sketched background 
of common human affections, of hopes and 
fears, joys and griefs, like unto our own. 
Looking at these beautiful photogravure repro- 
ductions of his paintings (there are seventy- 
seven of them), we should no doubt get very 
near to the heart of this artist ; for there is a 
peculiar fulness of self-revelation in a great 
painter's work, which is one measure of his 
greatness. With no other record of him than 
these pictures, we could read his story very 
well, in many of its essential phases. It would 
seem that this artist did not find himself very 
early, not developing even a definiteness of 
purpose until he was twenty-six years old, 
while it was at least fifteen years more before 
he had acquired anything that could properly 
be called a style. He was never, in fact, an 
accomplished brushman, and worked out all 
of his larger and more seriously designed can- 
vases through laborious processes that included 
many artistic devices besides that of the direct 
brush-stroke. He himself, in one of his letters, 
attributes his lack of popularity to the fact 
that he had " no handling," meaning that his 
brush-work was not fluent, and that he achieved 
his effects by the employment of other than 
direct brush handiwork. 

It is not possible here to follow the evolution 
of Constable's art from its beginning to its 
splendid maturity. It varied so greatly, both 
in manner and in excellence, not only in differ- 



ent periods but in the same period, that the 
writer himself does not attempt to review Con- 
stable's work as a direct chain of sequences, 
though he makes perfectly clear its essential 
characteristics when considered as a whole. 
These may be briefly indicated. 

Constable was the first real Nature painter, 
— the first, that is, who ever painted earth and 
sky with the single purpose of reproducing the 
actual sensation of their forms, their color, and 
their light. Others, like Raphael and Da Vinci, 
had painted these things as though not seeing 
them, making symbols and counters of them, 
mere servants to their artistic schemes. Titian, 
though he shows that he had looked at the 
mystery of twilight with his soul in his eyes, 
did not try to report the appearance of it, but 
used what he saw only as he could make it serve 
his other purpose. Even Rubens, with his 
splendidly facile way of putting down what he 
saw, and Rembrandt, and the lesser Dutchmen 
with all their natural disposition to paint 
" things as they are," never seemed to think 
that Nature deserved to be considered purely 
for herself, and with a mind and eye frankly 
open to her own color and light. It seems 
strange that an Englishman should be the first 
to find in the less seductive environment of his 
bleaker clime the full inspiration for a great 
landscape art, — for great it was, with all its 
narrowness of scope, its lack of subtlety in 
color, its indirection of labored craftsmanship ; 
strange past divining, that Southern skies and 
tints had not persuaded to their single service 
some of the great ones who looked upon them. 
Yet so it was ; and cold mist-swept skies, and 
valleys and fields that smile not over-brightly, 
won to themselves the full devotion that fairer 
and more inviting prospects had bidden for 
in vain. So England established for all time 
the first pure landscape tradition, — for Turner, 
his great contemporary, was rather a painter of 
dreams, and clothed earthly things with such 
richness of unearthly fancy that his pictures 
were " golden visions," as Constable called 
them, rather than transcripts of Nature. 

And here we come to one of the two great lim- 
itations in Constable's art. Neither in purpose 
nor effect was it largely creative. His desire 
seemed too much to paint the trees and the 
fields and the skies that he looked at " as they 
are." He loved them surpassingly ; and this 
very greatness of his love betrayed his art a 
little, causing his pictures, except in a very 
few instances, to lack that fine concentration 
of effect that landscape art only achieves when

the actual appearances of its subject are mod- 
ified in the direction of an intellectual purpose. 
This purpose must derive from something sug- 
gest«d by the scene itself, or the picture will 
be too imaginative, too fancy free, and will 
not waken our own nature consciousness ; but 
the purpose must be there, and must be felt, 
before a work can have that higher interest 
that attaches to a "human document." We 
must find, also, that his work lacked that ex- 
pertness in the "handling" of his medium 
that is found in the work of all the great 
masters of painting, and except in some of his 
sketches, makes them appear too indirectly done; 
while his drawing is often open to exception. 

It is greatly to belittle the discoverer, 
though, — whether it be a new world or some 
new field of painting that he has found, — to 
measure his accomplishment on the scale of its 
immediate importance. Had this been done, 
we should have had neither a World's Colum- 
bian Exposition nor this beautiful book. It 
is not to be questioned — nor does Mr. Holmes 
question it — that later painters have produced 
landscapes which, viewed either as the embodi- 
ment of human thought and feeling, or as nat- 
ural effect, are much better works of art than 
any done by John Constable. Yet we must 
remember that it was his mind that first enter- 
tained this " new thought " of Nature as being 
meet, just in herself, for art's whole service ; 
and his hand that first found good painter's 
terms for this new thought. In emphasizing 
this fact, however, the author of the book does 
not permit us to lose sight of such incomplete- 
ness in the art as has been suggested. His 
treatment of the subject is never that of the 
blind hero-worshipper, but keeps everywhere 
that critical balance that makes art- writing com- 
mend itself to sober minds. Yet if, in looking 
at some of these beautiful reproductions, we are 
borne momentlv from our own critical moorings, 
and hunger for some words that will fit our frame 
of mind, we find them here, — choice, discrim- 
inating, but having a flavor about them as 
though the critic also had felt like letting him- 
self go. 

A very delightful feature of the book, and 
very illuminating of its subject too, is the con- 
siderable number of excerpts from Constable's 
letters and lectures before the Royal Academy. 
These show intellectual qualities of a high or- 
der, combining wit and humor with evidence 
of the keenest appreciation of his art and of 
earnest well-considered purpose in it. In a 
lett«r to his friend Leslie, he states this pur- 



pose thus : " My art flatters nobody by imi- 
tation, it courts nobody by smoothness, it 
tickles nobody by petiteness, it is without 
either fol-de-rol or fiddle-de-dee." Again he 
writes : " Every thing seems full of blossom 
of some kind, and every step I take . . . that 
sublime expression of the Scriptures, ' I am 
the resurrection and the life,' seems as if 
uttered near me." And again: "The land> 
scape painter must walk the fields with an 
humble mind ; no arrogant man was ever per- 
mitted to see Nature in all her beauty." In 
these three extracts is a full confession of 
faith, a whole artistic creed. 

As Constable was slow in maturing his own 
art, so has the world been slow in acknowl- 
edging his claims. He had not, like Turner, 
a great writer to recommend him to his time ; 
and it is only of late that his high merits have 
been widely allowed, or that the words in which 
Mr. Holmes sums them up would find general 
assent. This is his verdict : " The most sin- 
cere, consistent, intelligent, and sympathetic 
worshipper of natural beauty as revealed in 
English pastoral scenery, who has ever lived." 
It may be that Mr. Holmes presses the notion 
of Constable's direct influence a little too far. 
He does it cautiously and tentatively, it is true ; 
but to suggest, even as a possibility, that Corot, 
for instance, could have assimilated to his 
ideally different sentiment and practice any- 
thing from the three pictures of Constable that 
were shown in Paris in 1824, is to make more 
of the Englishman's influence than seems con- 
sistent with a full appreciation of the other

of it has already appeared elsewhere, and has 
become part of the make-up of the American 
mind. Mr. Riis does not propose to work alone. 
His cry is not, " See what a fine thing I am 
doing ! " but " See what is being done, and can 
be done, and come and take a hand ! " It is the 
democratic ideal, that everyone can help, from 
President Koosevelt, whose portrait appears 
opposite the title-page, to the ignorant immi- 
grant who arrived yesterday. And for that mat- 
ter, "our poor human nature is at least as robust 
on Avenue A as up on Fifth Avenue, if it has 
half a chance, and often enough with no chance 
at all " (p. 220). The human species is ex- 
tremely variable, and the most progressive peo- 
ples exhibit most variation. Hence it happens 
that all men are not born equal ; do not come 
into the world with the same endowments. Is 
this fact to be a stumbling-block to democracy ? 
Not at all ; it is the one thing which makes a 
genuine democracy possible. Because each 
one preserves his own individuality, stands for 
something more or less unique, it is possible to 
have a national architecture, as it were, in 
which no part is useless, no part independent 
of the rest. Each may attain a certain supe- 
riority ; each may willingly acknowledge many 
kinds of inferiority ; none may cease to strive 
upward. Mr. Riis does not claim to be a 
sociologist, but the logical outcome of his work 
is to enable every individual to take his proper 
place in the world's work, — indeed, in the 
world's play also. This, at all events, is the 
" inalienable right " of each member of a de- 
mocracy, and the no less inalienable need of 
that democracy itself. 

Two or three things are plain to every 
reader of "The Battle with the Slum." One 
is, that the people of the slums do not have 
anything like a fair chance ; another, that they 
are capable of much improvement, given better 
conditions ; a third, that it does not do to wait 
on philanthropy for justice. These things are 
generally known, in a vague way ; but Mr. Riis 
makes them living realities. It is a favorite 
opinion of some people that the unfortunate and 
downtrodden are such because they are not ca- 
pable of anything else. There is necessarily a 
certain element of truth in this ; but from the 
time that the Israelites came out of Egypt, 
history has afforded instances enough of the 
regeneration or new birth of peoples who had 
been supposed incapable of anything noble. 
This country is the " promised land " of hordes 
of workers from over-sea, and we may believe 
with Mr. Riis that there are possibilities here 



of welding this miscellaneous and at first sight 
unpromising material into the structure of a 
great nation. This is not to be done, however, 
without strenuous effort, and the " battle " has 
been real enough. Mr. Riis thus speaks of the 
results, contrasting past with present : 

" Human life then counted for less than the land- 
lord's profits; to-day it is weighed in the scale against 
them. Property still has a powerful pull. ' Vested 
rights ' rise up and confront you, and no matter how 
loudly you may protest that no man has a right to kill 
his neighbor, they are still there. No one will contra- 
dict you, but they won't yield — till you make them. 
In a hundred ways you are made to feel that vested 
rights are sacred, if human life is not. But the glory 
is that you can make them yield. You couldn't then." 

It may be that Mr. Riis's style is rambling, 
and his sentences are occasionally obscure ; it 
may be that he is not always quite fair to 
things he does not understand ; but his book is 
a live book, full of human interest, and is the 
record of great things done. It will help to 
make things move, and that is what it was 
written for. 

Mr. Cooley's " Human Nature and the So- 
cial Order " is in many ways a remarkable book. 
The present writer, as he read it, found much 
to admire ; and yet the impression produced by 
the whole was unfavorable. Having said this, 
he feels that he owes some explanation, al- 
most an apology. The argument throughout is 
closely reiasoned, and it is hard to say exactly 
why it does not appear satisfactory. At the 
very beginning, the author boldly announces : 

" A separate individual is an abstraction unknown to 
experience, s>nd so likewise is society when regarded as 
something apart from individuals. The real thing is 
Human Life, which may be considered either in an 
individual aspect or a social, that is to say, general, 
aspect; but is always, as a matter of fact, both indi- 
vidual and general " (p. 1). 

Again : 

" The main thing here is to bring out the vital unity 
of every phase of personal life, from the simplest in- 
terchange of a friendly word to the polity of nations 
or of hierarchies. The common idea of the matter is 
crudely mechanical — that there are persons as there 
are bricks, and societies as there are walls. A person, 
or some trait of personality or of intercourse, is held to 
be the element of society, and the latter is formed by 
the aggregation of these elements. Now there is no 
such thing as an element of society in the sense that a 
brick is the element of a wall ; this is a mechanical con- 
ception quite inapplicable to vital phenomena. I should 
say that living wholes have aspects but not elements " 
(p. 134). 

As regards the self, it is by no means to be 
identified with the material body ; it is rather 
a body of feeling, or ideas, which may be much 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



121 



more closely identified with so-called external 
objects than with the parts of the individaal's 
anatomy. Says Mr. Cooley : 

" There is do view of the self, that will bear examin- 
atioD, which makes it alto^ther distinct, in onr minds, 
from other persons. If it includes the whole mind, 
then of course, it includes all the persons we think of, 
all the society which lives in our thoughts. If we con- 
fine it to a certain part of our thought with which we 
connect a distinctive emotion or sentiment called self- 
feeling, as I prefer to do, it still includes the persons 
with whom we feel most identified. Self and other do 
not exist as mutually exclusive social facts, and phraseol- 
ogy which implies that they do, like the antithesis 
egoism versus altruism, is open to the objection of 
Tagueness, if not of falsity " (pp. 91-92). 

Each individnal constructs a self-platform, 
the planks of which must fit together more or 
less harmoniously : and the sense of wrong is 
felt when anything is added which is inhar- 
monious. Thus, if a man regards himself as 
honest, be dislikes to do a dishonest thing, be- 
cause it breaks into and injures the self-idea. 
This self -platform, necessarily based largely on 
impressions received from others, is always re- 
lated to the society in which we move, and no 
one can think of himself except in relation to 
others. Even when the individual is isolated, 
physically and socially, he tends to create a 
mental society of ideal beings with whom he 
seems to hold intercourse. 

The present writer would be the last to deny 
the intimate connection between the individu- 
als of any society of living beings ; indeed, 
when one regards the complex social organ- 
ization of such animals as the Zoophytes, it be- 
comes difficult to say exactly what are the limits 
of personality in a physical sense. Or again, 
is a tree a single individual or a multitude of 
individuals? — the answer is not so simple as 
it looks. Yet, nevertheless, he is quite pos- 
itive that he is a distinct entity, much more 
distinct than a brick in a wall. When Mr. 
Cooley says that such a proposition will not 
bear examination, he means simply that no ob- 
jective proof can be found for it ; which, of 
course, is in the nature of the case. He may 
fairly urge, however, that my subjective con- 
sciousness recognizes only myself, and thus 
includes therein the universe, so far as it is 
known to me. If the universe is myself, there- 
fore I am the universe, and not a distinct and 
separate thing at all. — Q. E. D. To this it 
must be replied that a point exists in space, 
and by virtue of space, and yet is a thing of 
itself. If only one point existed, it would be 
identical with all space ; but we cannot con- 
ceive of space that is not extended, that is, 



many-pointed. So I affirm my totally distinct 
being, because I feel absolutely certain that 
there are other such beings, other points in the 
spiritual universe. Thus out of the fact of 
" other " comes the fact of " self," not as an 
" aspect " but as a veritable " element." To 
fully discuss Mr. Cooley 's book is impossible 
in a short review. It is full of interesting 
ideas, but we could wish that it were less wordy 
and more illuminated by concrete examples. 

Mr. W. J. Ghent, in "Our Benevolent 
Feudalism," presents us with a picture of 
modern society which recalls the occasions 
when one has seen one's reflection in a door- 
knob. The reflection was grotesque in the 
extreme, but unmistakably represented one's 
physiognomy. Mr. Ghent writes in a lucid 
and interesting manner, and arrives, in gen- 
eral, at these conclusions : 

<■ What, then, in this republic of the United States, 
may Socialist, Individualist, and Conservative see alike, 
if only they will look with unclouded vision ? In brie*, 
an irresistible movement — now almost at its culmi- 
nation — - toward great combinations in specific trade*; 
next toward eaaleMeaee of kindred industries, and thus 
toward the eompleta integration of capital. Consequent 
upon these changes, the group of captains and lieu- 
tenants of industry attains a daily increasing power, 
social, industrial and political, and becomes the ranking 
order in a vast series of gradations. The state becomes 
stronger in its relation to the propertyless citizen, 
weaker in its relation to the man of capital. A growing 
subordination of classes, and a tremendous increase in 
the numbers of the lower orders, follow. ... In a 
word, they who desire to live — whether farmers, worit- 
men, middlemen, teachers, or ministers — must make 
their peace with those who have the disposition of the 
livings. The result is a renascent Feudalism, which, 
though it differs in many forms from that of the time 
of Edward I., is yet based upon the same status of 
lord, agent and underling. It is a Feudalism somewhat 
graced by a sense of ethics and somewhat restrained by 
a fear of democracy." 

I sometimes have said that I am a socialist, 
and yet believe in the divine right of kings. 
I do not believe that a perfectly organized 
democratic society will be without leaders ; on 
the contrary, it will assiduously search out those 
who excel in any particular, and make full use 
of their talents. As a matter of fact, the com- 
monwealth of science is to-day organized on a 
perfectly international and democratic basis ; 
everyone who cares may have his say, and 
leadership exists at the same time, without com- 
pulsion. Authority is recognized too much 
rather than too little. I do not think, there- 
fore, that we have any reason for identifying 
mastership with tyranny ; the one is natural 
and desirable, the other an abomination.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



At the same time, of course Mr. Ghent is 
right in pointing out the vast amount of un- 
natural mastership or tyranny which exists in 
modern society. As a means of stirring peo- 
ple up to appreciate the real dangers of the 
situation, the book will do excellent service. 
The situation, as it seems to me, is this : In- 
dustry is rapidly becoming organized on a 
cooperative basis, so far as production is con- 
cerned, and the time is at hand when the people 
must choose whether to be slaves or free. If 
the people are not fit to participate in an in- 
dustrial democracy, they cannot, though all 
the capitalists should be drowned in the sea. 
Whenever and in such degree as they are fit, 
the country and the fulness thereof is theirs. 

It may justly be urged that as a matter of 
fact the people have not the chance to become 
fit. It is conceivable, of course, that they might 
be hindered in this to such a degree that no 
genuinely democratic government would ever 
become possible ; but this I cannot believe. At 
the same time, it is impossible to exaggerate 
the need for help in this matter, help which 
must largely take the form of education, of one 
sort or another. It is just for this reason that 
such men as Mr. Eiis are so invaluable. The 
problem is in a way a psychological one. The 
existing unfitness is mental rather than phy- 
sical. As I see it, one of the greatest difficulties 
in the way is the intense desire of the people 
to get something for nothing: to receive the 
unearned increment. It would seem as if they 
looked forward to the time, predicted by some 
facetious fellow, when all would live on the in- 
terest of accumulated capital !

The same blessing that has been as- 

inLZltcr. ''"''«<^ to s^^^P ^^y '^e" ^e extended 

to laughter. Each may be put down 
amoDg the choice saving graces of a possible 
vale of tears. A comprehensive survey of the phe- 
nomena involved in all that leads up to laughter 
and all that issues from it has not as yet been at- 
tempted in English ; Mr. Sully's volume on the sub- 
ject (Longmans) is accordingly timely, and, like 
all his writings, attractive. The scope of the topic 
is indeed a broad one, beginning with the place of 
laughter in the physiological economy and ending 
with a disquisition upon its philosophic justification 
and mStier ; while the intermediate considerations 
include a careful discussion of the genesis of laugh- 
ter, its appearance in the eras of childhood, its 



simulation or approximations in the animal life, its 
characterization among the less developed races of 
mankind, the differentiations of its object matter, 
and its various social, sssthetic, and intellectual 
ramifications. " In looking for the germs of laugh- 
ter we found ourselves in the wide and misty plains 
of biological speculation. In tracing its develop- 
ment we took a dip into the pleasant vales of child- 
psychology and anthropology, and then tried to 
climb the winding paths of social evolution. Hav- 
ing reached in this way the heights of modern 
civilization, we made a special investigation into 
the social organization of laughter, essentially indi- 
vidual and independent of the social standard, to 
which is given the name of humor. Throughout 
this voyage of discovery we have kept in view the 
question of the function of the laughing spirit in 
the life of the individual and of the community." 
The prospective reader may be assured that Mr. 
Sally's guidance through this varied region is most 
capable and suggestive. It brings home a profound 
sense of the unity and of the inter-relations of those 
expressions of the eternally human in which the 
true " humanities " have a common and mutually 
illuminating interest. It is no small tribute to the 
attainments of a philosophical writer in these days 
to have become the expounder of two such opposite 
tendencies as Pessimism and the Philosophy of 
Laughter, and to have imparted to both an unusual 
interest of exposition as well as philosophic grasp 
and literary expertness.

"The Library of Literary History,"

by " A Literary History of Persia." the work of 
Mr. Edward G. Bro?me. This is not a complete 
survey of the subject, but the first of two volumes, 
and contains only what the author calls the Pro- 
legomena of his work. In other words, it stops 
short of Firdawsi, and deals with practically none 
of the writers whose names are generally familiar 
to the Western world. In its scope and compre 
hensiveness. Mr. Browne's treatise thus departs 
widely from the general plan of the series in which 
it is included, and we are compelled to say that 
this departure extends also to the manner of treat- 
ment. The author speaks of M. Jusserand's 
" Literary History of the English People " as hav- 
ing served him for a model, bat no comparison 
eoold well be more misleading. A characteristic 
quotation will make this statement clear. 

"a^or the Pernan-Triting poets of Persia the chief primary

We submit that a book written in this style does 
not remind us of the delightful history of M. 
Juaserand. We have no doabt of Mr. Browne's 
sehtdarship, but a more unreadable book was never 
written than this companion volume to Dr. Hyde's 
"Ireland" and Professor Wendell's "America." 



The first volume of Mr. Charles 

nuikttua* Oman's "History of the Peninsular 
Partu«tar R'ar. -y^^ .. (Qxford University Press) 
represents the painstaking and careful work of an 
able historical scholar, fortunate in the possession 
of much new material on an interesdng period of 
history. When this is understood, there remains 
bat little to say of the work itself ; for it is wholly 
impossible, in a brief notice, to cite the various 
episodes and events upon which the author easts 
new light or alters previous historical impressions. 
No general authoritative history of the Peninsular 
War has been produced since Napier's famous 



work. In the sixty years that have elapsed siaee 
that work appeared, many valuable memoirs have 
been written, and many sources of information have 
been opened, or discovered, which were not within 
Napier's reach. Mr. Oman has made himself the 
master of these sources, and has analyzed and used 
them with a scholar's care. His work, therefore, is 
authoritative and modern, and as such most sup- 
plant Napier's where facts are in question. If this 
new and trustworthy material were attractively 
arranged and presented, the " History of the Pen- 
insular War " would take higher rank than it can 
possibly do under the circamstanees. for Mr. 
Oman's careless writing forbids it a place among 
really great works of history. It would be unjust 
to the author to decry his book by means of a com- 
parison with the more readable qualities of Napier, 
for Mr. Oman has admitted his limitations as a 
narrator, and has distinctly acknowledged his in- 
ability to comp>ete with the earlier writer. It may 
also be offered as an excuse for dryness, that the 
necessarily minute technical details of military 
history are incapable of illuminating treatment. 
Yet, though recognizing this, every reader most 
feel a keen sense of disappointment that in nar- 
rating events not necessarily technical, or that in 
characterizing important personages of his study, 
Mr. Oman has used a seemingly careless familiarity 
of language, wholly unsuited either to his theme, 
or, very evidently, to his own abilities as a writer. 
Worst of all, it is apparently % forced earelesaoess, 
— one is almost tempted to call it a striring after 
e£fect by intended crudity of statement, — and, aa 
such, is the more impardonable. Still, this offense 
against good taste is much more marked in the 
opening chapters than in later ones, and the book 
as a whole steadily improves in style throughout its 
six hundred pages. It is at least a very welcome, 
and a wholly trustworthy, piece of modem histor- 
ical investigation. 

South Africa is a land of extremes. 
Ever since the Portuguese landings 
and explorations of the fifteenth 
century, this country has had a fascination for ad* 
venturers. Portuguese, Dutch, and English hare 
successively searched for its hidden riches. Deserts, 
famines, and savage native tribes conld not turn 
them back. Over veldt, river, and mountain, they 
pushed their way into the interior. Mr. Gardner 
F. Williams, in "The Diamond Mines of South 
Africa" (Macmillan), tells how the greatest dia- 
mond mine of the world was discovered, developed, 
and made the sourtse of uncounted wealth. A child 
picked up a shining pebble for a plaything from the 
gravel on the edge of a river ; and that pebble, 
proving to be a diamond, led to the discovery of 
the great diamond fields of Sooth Africa. This 
volume discusses the original voyages to that land, 
the hardships which the pioneers endured, the 
progress made in its settlement, and the growth of 
other settlements almost down to the present time.

The bulk of the work covers the years from 1871 
down to the present — the period of diamond 
mining. We get a vivid picture of the growth of 
methods of mining, from the original shaking of 
sieves on the surface to the underground shaft- 
mining of to-day. Such a marvellous revolution in 
thirty years certainly bespeaks the genius and the 
enterprise of the Englishmen and Americans en- 
gaged in the work. The reader's conception of the 
author's narrative is clarified and defined by 493 
illustrations in the text, 28 photogravures, and 12 
maps. An appendix, on the siege of Kimberley, 
gives one a good idea of that period of anxiety and 
distress. Many readers will be particularly inter- 
ested in the author's estimate of Cecil Rhodes and 
his plans for the development of South Africa. 
Other characters prominent in South African min- 
ing operations also receive adequate recognition. 
This volume properly balongs to that class of liter- 
ature which carefully and minutely sets forth the 
great industrial enterprises of this vigorous age. It 
also shows that the author made use of the best 
information, popular and scientific, to elucidate his 

fascinating theme. 

One could hardly be more thor- 
oughly saturated with one's theme, 
more ardently and enthusiastically 
aglow, than is the author of " Boston Days " (Little, 
Brown & Co.). Miss Lilian Whiting here deals es- 
pecially with the Boston (and vicinity) of the mid- 
nineteenth century, " a most remarkable period," 
she says, " and one which is almost without parallel 
since the golden days of Pericles." It would be 
surprising not to find some extravagant assertions 
in a writer so carried away with her enthusiasms. 
Alcott she regards as " far and away the greatest 
man of his time," and Hawthorne as " unquestion- 
ably the greatest romancist in the English tongue." 
Of psychic research she unhesitatingly declares that 
it " may be said to have scientifically demonstrated 
the actual nature of life after the change we call 
death." While there is much to be said in praise 
of the spirit of the book as a whole, one cannot 
but note its tendency to diffuseness, frequent re- 
petition, and errors of fact. The Emerson gene- 
alogry is bungled, both William and Joseph being 
made the husbands of Pboebe Bliss. Lowell's mar- 
riage to Maria White is placed in 1866 — thirteen 
years after her death. Some puzzling phrases oc- 
cur. Good health is called " a very rational factor 
in life." " An occnltation of correspondence " is 
said to have existed among the literary lights of 
Emerson's time. "This data," "nominus umbra," 
"Echermann," "Brahman" (for Braham), and 
other irregularities, give unpleasing variety to Miss 
Whiting's pages. " Inflorescence " is worked to 
death. If the reader can overlook these and sim- 
ilar defects, he will find much to enjoy in Miss 
Whiting's entertaining pages. Many letters from 
Mrs. Whipple's valuable collection are published 
for the first time, and the volume is rich in por- 
traits and facsimiles. 



That little pile of ragged mountains 
Id r^7r known as Switzerland has produced 

some of the great characters of his- 
tory. The beginning of the sixteenth century found 
this collection of Swiss cantons in the throes of re- 
ligious and political reform. The leader of both 
of these movements was Ulrich Zwingli. What 
Luther was to the religious upheaval in Germany, 
Zwingli was to religion and patriotism in Switzer- 
land. Mr. Simpson's "Life of Ulrich Zwingli" 
(Baker & Taylor) is a re-statement of the chief 
facts and events in that champion's career. The 
story is based upon the abundant and very com- 
plete literature of Zwingli's time and pen. The au- 
thor is an ardent admirer of his hero, and sets forth 
with full meed of praise his contribution to that 
mighty movement which arose in Switzerland 
against Rome, and the attempts of foreign govern- 
ments to allure to their own ranks the choicest blood 
of the country. The author compares Luther and 
Zwingli, greatly to the disparagement of the former. 
Doubtless Zwingli's hard common-sense and great 
wisdom in dealing with people made him such a 
natural and wise leader. He was an open-minded, 
cautious, yet rapid enough driver of his people, to do 
Switzerland and religious reform inestimable good. 
Mr. Simpson has made this story attractive, instruc- 
tive, and valuable to everyone interested in the 
tragical past of those heroic mountaineers. 

Depth of thought, charm of style, 
P<t>>y flipi"-' apt illustration, clearness of demon- 

on vital themes. ' , ' 

stration, with now and then an out- 
cropping of his vein of quiet humor, combine to 
make the late Dr. C. C. Everett's " Immortality 
and Other Essays " (American Unitarian Associa- 
tion) a most readable and instructive volume. The 
power to treat the abstrusest themes of religion and 
philosophy in a manner at once so scholarly, so 
clear and simple, and so convincing, is found in no 
other writer. The central thought of the opening 
essay is that immortality is as incapable of demon- 
stration to the mortal as is the full life of manhood 
and womanhood to the infant in its cradle. The 
second chapter, on " The Known and the Unknow- 
able in Religion," and the third, on " Mysticism," 
discuss Mr. Herbert Spencer's assertion that the 
essence of religion is mystery, and seek to show 
that, while the sense of mystery is central and su- 
preme in religious thought and life, nevertheless 
God is in the known as well as in the unknown. 
The fourth paper is a memorial address on Joseph 
Priestley. The next is on " The Faith of Science 
and the Science of Faith." The ancient Hindu 
theory made the earth rest on an elephant, and the 
elephant on a tortoise ; just as the old lady thought 
it rested on a rock, that rock on another, and so 
on, — a succession of rocks all the way down. 
John Stuart Mill, with equal simplicity, affirms 
that scientific induction rests upon induction ; in 
other words, that there is induction all the way 
down. Dr. Everett shows the futility of all such

grasping after demonstrable and tangible supports. 
Fandamentally, faith is as necessary to science as 
to religion. '• The Philosophy of the Sublime " is 
maeh in the key of that delightfol little book, 
" Poetry, Comedy, and Duty," from the same pen. 
The Toinme closes with " Spencer's Reconciliation 
of Science and Religion " and '• The Gain of His-

must go to the book itself. Its contents are none 
the worse for having already appeared in different

The methods of romantic fiction ap- 
'■hillr^ML^ plied to autobiography have pro- 
duced a readable book in Madame 
Adam's " Romance of my Childhood and Youth " 
(Appleton), which is thoroughly French from 
cover to cover. Love, of the violently demonstra- 
tive and hysterical sort, and ever-recurring political 
discussions that wander out into the wide nowhere 
and tumble over the edge, form the characteristic 
staple of the book. That the heroine, petted and 
quarreled over and fought for by grandparents, 
parents, and aunts, was not utterly spoiled in the 
rearing, fills the reader with wonder. Mme. Adam 
(otherwise known as Juliette Lamber — her father 
was Jean Louis Lambert) brings the interesting 
records of her precocious and somewhat turbulent 
early life up to the time of her first and unhappy 
marriage with M. Lamessine, when she appears 
to have been about fifteen years old. A half- 
promise is held out of a second volume devoted to 
her literary career. The translation, which is an- 
onymous, is marred by some infelicities, and even 
by an occasional grammatical error. 

Although there is no historical foun- 
dation for the tale of Romeo and 
«^*>K«ry. Juliet, yet Shakespeare willed it that 

the scene thereof should be laid in " fair Verona." 
The Capnlet and Montagu houses, and a fend ex- 
isting between them, are mentioned by Dante ; and 
the Veronese point out the house of Romeo, and 
have erected a tomb to be exhibited to visitors as 
that in which the " star cross'd lovers " were buried. 
In Verona, Dante Alighieri found a haven in his 
day of adversity and exile, and the acknowledg- 
ment of the hospitality he received is world- 
renowned. It was in the streets of Verona that he 
was pointed out by women of the lower classes as 
the one " who went to Hell and returned when he 
listed, and brought news up above of those who 
were there below." It was the city of the Scaligers 
who had a ladder for their coat-of-arms. It is a 
city with a history and with an art peculiarly its 
own, and with many architectural and archsologi- 
cal features, — notably the amphitheatre once ca- 
pable of seating 20,000 persons. Altogether it is 
a desirable city to visit, and desirable to read about. 
Mrs. Althea Weil tells the interesting " Story of 
Verona" in the "Mediaeval Towns Series" of 
exquisite handbooks (Dent-Macmillan), and her 
story is illustrated by Miss Nelly Erichsen and 



Vtnma,iU 



Miss Helen M. James, and hence we have what 
we might call " Verona as Seen by Three English- 
women." The book does not disappoint as, how- 
ever much we may expect of it under either title.

The work of two modem French masters, Corot and 
Millet, is given an admirable presentation in the special 
winter number of " The Studio " (John Lane). The 
text, edited by Mr. Charles Holme, consists of two ex-

brief notes by Mr. Frederick Keppel on the etchings of 
Millet. In the way of illustration, there are nearly one 
hundred and fifty plates, many in photogravure and 
colors, forming a collection that would reflect credit 
on a work costing several times as much as this. 

Among recent modem language texts we have from 
the American Book Co. Leasing's " Nathan der Weise,"

by Mr. John Rogers Williams. It covers the entire his- 
torv of the University, from the graduation of the first 
honorman in 1748 to the close of the year 1902. Al- 
though little more than an annotated list of names, it 
is a work of marked interest, and makes a dignified 
volume of over two hundred and fifty pages. Un- 
fortunately, the record is incomplete for certain pr»- 
Revolutionary years, as there is no official source- 
material for the period before 1820, and the files of 
current newspapers have been the sole reliance of the 
editor. An introduction describes the various prizes and 
fellowships offered by the University, and there is a full 
index of the names of honormen.

The essay by Mme. Blanc (Th. Bentzon) on Colonel 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, translated by Mr. E. M. 
Waller, is published by Mr. H. W. Bell in a small vol- 
ume entitled " A Typical American." The essay is a 
chatty and superficial performance, but an agreeable 
one withal. 

The novels of Jane Austen in five volumes, with in- 
troductions by Mr. Austin Dobson and illustrations by 
Mr. Hugh Thomson, all offered at a low price by the 
Messrs. Macmillan, should prove tempting to book- 
lovers, and justify a new edition of this many-editioned 
novelist. The set is very neat and satisfactory. 

"The Poetry of George Wither," edited by Mr. 
Frank Sidgwick, who provides a lengthy introduction, 
forms two volumes in the tasteful " Muses' Library," 
which the Messrs. Scribner import. We have from the 
same publishers the poems of Kobert Herrick, also in 
two volumes, added to the " Caxton Series " of illus- 
trated reprints. 

The Burrows Brothers Co. have just published two 
reprints of interesting Americana : Thomas Budd's 
"Good Order Established in Pennsylvania and New 
Jersey " (1685), edited by Mr. Frederick J. Shepard, 
and "A Character of the Province of Maryland " (1666), 
by George Alsop, edited by Professor Newton D. 
Mereness. These editions are limited to two hundred 
and fifty copies each. 

Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co. are the publishers of 
an excellent text-book of " Composition and Rhetoric," 
the joint work of Miss Rose M. Kavana and Mr. Arthur 
Beatty. It is described as " primarily a book of tech- 
nique," and covers two or three years of high school 
work. A distinctive feature is the series of eighteen 
plates reproducing famous paintings chosen for their 
usefulness in providing themes for composition writing.

Santa Fe all the Way

than three days you are in California. It 's Santa Fe all 
the way — -train, track, and management. 

shortest line, Chicago to Los Angeles and San Diego. A direct route to San 
Francisco. Only line to Grand Canyon of Arizona. 

Money cannot provide a finer train. Think of a travel comfort: here it is. Cosy 
compartment Pullmans, sunny observation parlor, a well-selected library, electric 
lights; also buffet-smoking car, with barber shop and daily stock reports. But the 
crown of it all is the dining-car service — Harvey's best, which is the best in the world. 
Convincing facts in booklets.

It is skilful and highly interesting., reminding one of Marion Craw- 
ford at his best, it is not as a novel that it will first be considered. 
It describes with minuteness the workings of the Church in Rome, 
and though it spares not condetanation of what is evil in the Church, 
those who read carefully will have no doubt but that Mr. Bagot 
writes out of a full heart, striving to correct evils to which even his 
devotion can not blind him." — Indianapolis News.

Some of Appletons' Latest Books 



For a Maiden Brave 



FICTION 



A Whaleman's Wife 



By Chauncy C. Hotchkiss. Illustrated in colors. 
12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 
" It is such a book as one will ait up through the night 
hours to finish." 

" It moves rapidly, and is full of thrilling incidents." 
" There never was a novel just like this, and despite all 
of Mr. Hotchkiss's clever writing heretofore, this is cer- 
tainly his masterpiece." — St. Paul Dispatch. 



By F. T. BuLLEN, author of "The Cruise of the 
Cachalot," " Deep-Sea Plunderings," etc. Illus- 
trated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 

" The reader will do well to place himself in the gkilf nl 
hands of the novelist, and read his book from beginning to 
end. One is impressed with its general truthfulness, and 
convinced that no one would be led from its pages to covet ' a 
life on the briny deep ' in a whaler." — Indianapolis Sentinel. 



BETTER THAN FICTION 



A Virginia Girl in the Civil War 

By Mybta Lockett Avaky. 12ino. Cloth, 
$1.25 net ; postage, 12 cents additional. 

" This is an interesting i-ecord of the life of one of the 
brave daughters of the South during the rebellion. We have 
also vivid and charming pictures of the chivalry of both 
Southern and Northern officers towards women." — Chicago 
Tribune. 

" It photographs the spirit of the age in a direct detailed 
way that no so-called historical novel witli manufactured 
situations and worn-out sentiments can dare to approach." 
— St. Paul Pioneer Press. 



The Story of the Trapper 

By A. C. Laut, author of " Heralds of Empire." 
Illustrated by Heming. (The Story of the West 
Series, Edited by Ripley Hitchcock. ) Illustrated. 
12mo. Cloth, $1.25 net ; postage, 12 cents 
additional. 

" ' The Story of the Trapper ' as told by Miss A. C. Laut 
is more romantic than any tale of fiction. The author has 
brought to her work a remarkable knowledge of forest lore 
and something more than a mere acquaintance with the early 
history of this continent. In her hands the facts connected 
with the struggles of the pioneer traders are woven together 
with a deftness that makes a splendid record of adventure. 
It is seldom that any author succeeds so admirably in awaken- 
ing the enthusiasm of the reader who cons a record of the 
past." — Milwaukee Sentinel. 



Personal Reminiscences of 
Prince Bismarck 

By Sidney Whitman, author of " Imperial Ger- 
many," etc. With Portraits. Large 12mo. Cloth, 
gilt top, uncut, $1.60 net; postage, 16c. additional. 
" One is at a loss to know where to particularize in com- 
menting on Mr. Whitman's book, it is so full of interesting 
side lights on a remarkably interesting personality." — The 
Chicago Interior. 

" In these pages we see Bismarck the man, not Bismarck 
the statesman and soldier. It is a fine portraiture, and pre- 
sents the great German in the aspect of companion and 
friend." — Chicago Journal. 

Appletons' Business Series. 

The Work of Wall Street 

By Sereno S. Pratt. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25 net ; 
postage, 12 cents additional. 
" For the first time so far as we are aware, Wall street is 
pictured to us in a book from the inside. This intensely 
interesting story of the mysterious inner doings of the 
mysterious realm which we know so little about deals very 
comprehensively and very primarily with the interesting 
subject. Mr. Pratt's book is all the more convincing because 
he assumes the attitude of the repoiter seeking to tell a 
jjlain story, and not attempting to foist any of his own 
opinions upon the reader. It is simply a graphic picture of 
the ins and outs of Wall street, which takes the average 
man into confidence, and opens up all the purposes, methods, 
and operations of speculation. ' — St. Paul Dispatch. 



IMPORTANT NOTICE 

About March 20 we will publish a new novel entitled " RICHARD ROSNEY," by 
Maxwell Gray, author of " The Silence of Dean Maitland," " House of Hidden Treasure," 
etc. Maxwell Gray has not yet published a novel in this country for which there has not 
been a large sale. This new book is said to be the strongest ever written by this author.

HERRINGS AND BOOKS. 

In the light of certain recent happenings, one 
might paraphrase the old saying of Fletcher of 
Saltoun. and remark: " I care not who make» 
the tariff laws of a country, if I may make the 
treasury rulings." Two practices of our cus- 
toms service have been exploited in the New 
York " Evening Post " during the past month 
that are interesting in themselves, and more 
strikingly so when placed in contrast with each 
other. In general terms, it may be said that 
these two interpretations of the law illnstrate 
how tenderly, on the one hand, treasury official- 
dom deals with a commercial interest of any 
sort, and how roughly, on the other, it handles 
an interest that is mainly related to the intellec- 
tual life of the nation. 

Herrings and books are the respective sub- 
jects of the two practices that have just been 
brought to light. We have a duty on herrings, 
as a matter of course, for the protection of the 
New England fisherman, and for the purpose 
of preventing American manhood from being 
cheapened by an opportunity to consume cheap 
food. The New England fisherman can catch 
his herrings and bring them to market without 
any danger of competition from the Canadian 
product. But the canny Gloucester skipper 
knows a trick worth two of that. Instead of 
going to the trouble of catching his own her- 
rings, he sends his smacks to the Newfound- 
land shore, buys by the barrel his herrings 
from the Newfoundlanders who have caught 
them, and enters his cargo at Gloucester duty 
free as a product of American industry. The 
cat recently escaped from the bag when an at- 
tempt was made to bring a cargo of this sort 
into the port of Boston. Since the herrings 
had obviously been caught by pauper Canadian 
labor, they were required to pay duty. An ap- 
peal to the treasury resulted in a stem rebuke 
to the over-zealous collector, who was directed 
to conform to " the custom of the port of Glou- 
cester," and admit such herrings without duty 
as the product of American fisheries. 

Now for the quite different matter of the 



140 



THE DIAL. 



[March 1» 



books. An English publisher wrote last No- 
vember to Mr. Brett, the president of the Mac- 
millan Co., describing an important work that 
was in preparation, and offering to sell the 
American firm an edition of five hundred copies 
at a certain price. The offer was accepted, and 
the books, with their accompanying invoice, 
reached New York a few weeks ago. Knowing 
something of the suspicion with which our cus- 
toms officials regard all importers — especially 
of books, scientific instruments, and works of 
art, — Mr. Brett increased the invoiced valua- 
tion of the shipment by fifteen per cent before 
attempting to pay the twenty-five per cent tax 
which our enlightened government imposes 
upon all knowledge that happens to be printed 
in the English language. This seems to have 
been an unwise step, for it caused suspicion to 
darken into conviction of fraudulent intent, 
with the result that duties and penalties were 
imposed amounting in all to a sum nearly equal 
to the actual price of the books. In other words, 
this bit of customs jugglery ended in forcing the 
importer to pay a duty of ninety per cent upon 
a purchase which the law plainly declares shall 
be taxed at the rate of twenty-five per cent. 
Thus is the wisdom of protection justified of her 
children. 

The official pretext for this extrordinary 
performance is found in the claim that books 
must be taxed upon their market value, and 
that this value is fixed by the selling price in 
the country of publication. If an invoice is 
made out for less than two-thirds or there- 
abouts of the retail price so much the worse 
for the importer. He will be taxed at the 
higher rate anyway, and made to pay a pen- 
alty besides. It is possible that the law war- 
rants such an interpretation, although it is 
strange that its meaning should have been just 
discovered. Our present tariff law is such a 
tissue of indefensible provisions that an irra- 
tional feature more or less does not greatly 
matter. But this interpretation, if sustained, 
will make it practically impossible for editions 
of new English books to be sold to American 
houses. Such editions, as everyone knows who 
has any acquaintance with trade conditions, 
are offered at one-half or less of the retail 
price in the country of origin. This is the 
" market value " in such a case, just as the 
higher price is the market value in the case of 
the single copy sold to an individual purchaser 
or the dozen copies .taken by a bookseller. We 
presume from Mr. Brett's figures that the work 
which is the subject of his complaint was 



offered him for about forty per cent of the list 
price in place of the sixty per cent or more 
which would be asked for small quantities sold 
to the English trade. This would afford a 
reasonable profit on the cost of production of 
the extra edition, because in such a case the 
first cost, which must determine the selling 
price in England, need not be taken into the 
reckoning. It is upon some such terms aa 
these that the publishers of either country have 
always been accustomed to place in the other 
special editions of their new publications. If 
the recent ruling be upheld, this practice must 
cease because the duties exacted will prove 
prohibitive. 

What the public fails to realize unless its 
attention is particularly directed to the matter, 
is the fact that the price of a book in the 
country of its publication must be enough to 
cover the cost of the first copy printed as well 
as the cost of the subsequent copies, and also 
enough to cover those advertising and other 
expenses without which the book will seek in 
vain for purchasers. Now in the case of an 
American edition of an English book, the task 
of creating a market falls upon the American 
publisher, which is a sufficient reason why he 
should not buy the books (or be taxed upon 
them) at the price prevailing in the English 
market. If he is required to do this, he simply 
cannot publish the book at all. Concerning 
the share of the publisher in promoting the 
sale of a book, Mr. Brett very justly says : 

" If one of our very popular authors were asked as 
to why his book found such a multitude of readers, he 
would, I fear, in most cases answer that the public 
appreciated the value of the book, admired its many 
merits, and demanded it. If a similar question were 
put to one who knows from experience the publishing 
and bookselling trades, he would tell you, and rightly, 
that the publisher was entitled to at least a share 
of the credit for the large sale which the book 
attained." 

Furthermore, no one who understands the sub- 
ject will deny the conclusive character of the 
following statement from the same source : 
" In importing a new book I am importing 
something which has not yet a value at all in 
the ordinary sense of the word, but something 
to which a value may be given." 

It is difficult to discuss a question like this 
with anything like patience, because the very 
idea of a duty on books is abhorrent to the 
cultivated intelligence, and the practice of im- 
posing such a duty in this country is utterly 
indefensible. It is not pleasant for a patriotic 
American to feel that in this matter his country 



1903.] 



THE DIAL.

deliberately places itself upon a low plane of 
civilization, and occupies the position of reject- 
ing enlightenment and placing obstacles in the 
path of intellectual progress. When the Con- 
stitution gave to Congress the power of laying 
taxes for " the general welfare," its framers 
would have been much amazed had they been 
told that this power would in time become so 
perverted as to include the taxation of knowl- 
edge. The argument for revenue is too trivial 
to be considered seriously, for our total annual 
importation of books is valued only at about a 
million and a half of dollars, of which probably 
one-third is duty free. As for the argument for 
protection, it is based upon a fallacy so transpar- 
ent that we do not see how it can impose upon 
a person of ordinary intelligence. One book 
does not compete with another in any real sense ; 
the man who wants a particular book will not 
purchase another book instead because the price 
is lower. He will either buy the book he wants 
or go without it, and in either case he will think 
profane thoughts of a government which sub- 
jects him to the petty irritation of such a duty. 
Of all the many interests so unrighteously shel- 
tered by our tariff laws none is so absolutely 
unreal as that which, in the name of protection, 
has thus far been successful in enforcing its 
demand for a tax upon American education 
and scholarship. The sheer folly and stupidity 
of the thing is so obvious that it does not seem 
possible that such a practice should long out- 
live the century that gave it birth. 



THE RE-COMING OF ANTHONY 
TROLLOPE. 



A group of worshippers who have been faithful 
in their devotions at an all-bat-deserted literary 
shrine are looking up in pleased surprise to find 
the neglected altar grown gay with votive lights, 
and men hastening to perform their genuflections 
where formerly they passed by unheeding. St. 
Anthony seems in a fair way to be given his place 
on the beadroll beside St. William, St. Charles, and 
St. George. To drop the metaphor. — Anthony 
TroUope, who but a few years ago was thoaght of 
by the general reader, in the words of Professor 
Trent, merely as " the man who wrote long novels 
to order in a mechanical fashion," and whom the 
critics were wont to name only to qaote the un- 
fortunate two-hundred-and-fifty-words-per-quarter- 
of-an-hour statement, is fast coming to his own again. 
" Once again his name creates a stir of interest," 
says Mr. Edward Fuller, writing on " Real Forces 
in Literature " in the February "Atlantic," " and 
his singularly vivid and vital characters . . . are 



no longer caviare to all but the chosen few "; so 
that Bareetshire may soon be almost as familiar to 
the novel-reading public as the year's successor to 
Ruritania or Drumtochty. 

A curious chapter in the history of Victorian fic- 
tion is the neglect which suddenly overwhelmed th» 
most popular English novelist of the period imme- 
diately succeeding that dominated by the two 
masters. How large was the number of Anthony 
TroUope's readers the statistics in his autobiography 
prove, and those of us whose memory goes back to 
the old " Franklin Square Library" of the pre-copy- 
right days will recollect. Yet almost immediately 
after his death, in 1881, he was forgotten so com- 
i plet«ly that hardly one in a hundred of the most 
i inveterate novel-readers of the present generation' 
but would be puzzled by a reference to Mrs. 
, Proudie or the Duke of Omnium. Popularity, it 
is true, is an inadequate test of an author's claim to 
1 permanency. There are a few books that are sell- 
ing their hundreds of thousands^to-day, which yet — 
to put it mildly — are not likely to find a place on 
j the shelves with the classics; but Trollope lived 
I before the art of book advertising had reached itS' 
; present pitch of perfection, and his popularity wa»- 
\ one legitimately earned among discriminating 
readers. His sudden decline from favor may be 
partially accounted for by the fact that, as it were, 
I he outlived himself. Achieving success with " Th» 
; Warden " in 1855, he published novels at an amas- 
I ingly rapid rate for almost thirty years. At the 
last, he fell into the error against which he warned^ 
other novelists, and wrote, as he has put it, not be- 
' cause he had a story to tell, but because he had to 
tell a story. But since " Anne of Geierstein " and 
"Count Robert of Paris" have not caused us to 
forget " Ivanhoe" and " Waverley," and since 
" Lovel the Widower " has not dimmed the glory 
of "Vanity Fair," the writer who gave us "The 
Small House at AUington," " Barchester Towers,'*" 
and " Phineas Finn " may well be forgiven " The 
Duke's Children," "Mr. Scarborough's Family," 
and other late productions of a pen which did not 
cease from activity when the brain of its wielder 
had lost its freshness. For even when the dozen 
or more novels that most readers who were not 
Trollope devotees would characterize as " respect- 
ably dull " are omitted from the list, there remain 
among Trollope's works not far from a score of 
novels, outclassed, it is true, by the masterpieces of 
the grants who were his contemporaries, but by them 
alone. We have from him nothing in which we 
feel the force of inspiration, — indeed, how often 
do we feel that in fiction, except when the Bernstein, 
speaks to Harry Warrington, beneath the Kneller 
portrait of Beatrix, or when the little govemesv 
avows her passion to her master and lover? But 
even though we admit that Trollope never reached 
the heights found by two or three other English 
novelists, the writer who described the death of 
Mr. Harding and gave us the scene in the episcopal 
palace between the curate and the diocesan tyrant'

in petticoats, deserved a better fate than the ob- 
livion from which he is only now being rescued. 

The quality which has invariably been recog- 
nized, by even the least favorable of his critics, and 
which makes him quite unapproachable on his own 
ground, is his absolute naturalness. In all his books 
there is no single touch of exaggeration. Not one 
of his characters talks in a fashion too fine or too 
•melodramatic for real life ; not the divine Jane 
^herself was freer from any taint of the " big bow- 
■wow style." To quote Hawthorne's formerly fa- 
miliar praise, his books are " as real as if some 
:giant bad hewn a great lump out of the earth and 
.put it under a glass case, with all its inhabitants 
going about their business, and not suspecting that 
they were being watched." The complications 
which form the plots are precisely such as occur to us 
■daily^ — or rather, such as might have occurred to 
U8 if we had happened to be members of the upper 
' midde-class in the England of the sixties. The ef- 
forts of a clergyman to secure promotion ; the in- 
trigues of the mother of a slender-pursed young 
man to gain her son a wealthy bride, or to prevent 
'him from losing his heart to a dowerless maiden; 
'the troubles of a vicar who has imprudently got 
into debt, — these are the every-day matters which 
'Trollope treats of, so that we feel, more than with 
-any other author, that the distance between that 
world which lies between the covers of a book and 
the one which lies outside of them is very slight. 
And yet it is an injustice to recognize in him, as 
many have done, merely the merit of accurate por- 
traiture. There is a delicacy in some of his best 
work which proves him an artist, not a photo- 
grapher. In " The Warden," the character of Mr. 
Harding, the gentle and lovable old clergyman 
whose sense of honor will not permit him to retain 
his living a'fter the suggestion has been made that 
the stipend attached to it is unjustly large, is drawn 
with a marvellously fine touch. Mr. Harding has 
■been compared to Colonel Newcome ; it is high 
praise, but the two are kin. In the other volumes 
■of the Barsetshire series, in which the story of Mr. 
Harding and his clerical neighbors is continued, we 
have the terrible and wonderful Mrs. Proudie. In 
his life of Thackeray, TroUope says that Sir Pitt 
Crawley has always been to him a stretch of au- 
dacity which he was unable to understand. The 
picture of the henpecked bishop and his vulgarly 
'formidable helpmeet comes near to equalling 
Thackeray's daring sketch of his old reprobate of 
■a baronet. There are not many better scenes any- 
where in fiction than the glorious one in which the 
■hitherto unconquered Mrs. Proudie meets defeat at 
the hands of the poverty-stricken curate, Crawley. 
Trollope noted Thackeray's evident enjoyment in 
writing "Barry Lyndon"; the discomfiture of Mrs. 
Proudie must have been as enjoyable in the writing 
■as in the reading. 

One of Trollope's strongest claims to be ranked 
among the great novelists of his day has perhaps 
never been sufficiently considered. It is not the least 



of his merits that his women are as true to life as 
are his men. Most of us will be ready to agree with Sir 
Leslie Stephen when he admits that the male novel- 
ist is apt to find himself upon uncertain ground when 
dealing with his heroines. Is it the unpardonable 
sin to say that the pencil of even the greatest mas- 
ter of Victorian fiction lacked sureness of touch in 
drawing women ? Putting Becky apart as hors con- 
cours, what have we in Amelia, Helen, Theo. Lam- 
bert, Charlotte, perhaps even Laura toward the last, 
but the descendants of that other Amelia, Fielding's 
Mrs. Booth, who was the admiration of the later 
novelist, and whose portrait shows appreciation of 
one most admirable trait of femininity, but no very 
wide or deep knowledge of the sex? A conviction 
of their capacity for immeasurable devotion, and 
of their utter unreasonableness and inconsistency, 
would perhaps sum up Thackeray's articles of faith 
regarding women. Nor was Thackeray himself by 
any means sure that his portraits were faithful; for 
the frequent allusions to feminine hypocrisy and 
powers of dissimulation indicate an uneasy conscious- 
ness that he was on terra incognita when bis heroines 
were in question. With Trollope there is nothing 
of the kind. He was at no time impressed witb 
the need of taking his women with painful serious- 
ness, and we have no laborious studies of the subtle 
in femininity such as later writers have given us. 
His heroines are without exception concerned with 
the simple everyday theme of " she would and she 
would not " and its variations, merging at times 
into the equally simple but less agreeable " she 
would but he would not." And in dealing with 
these affairs of the heart, " the apostle of the com- 
monplace," as some contemptuous critic once dubbed 
Trollope, was preeminently successful. He has 
given us more and better pictures of the English 
girl in love than all his fellows together. What 
differentiates his galaxy of heroines from the 
amiable inanities plentiful enough in the pages of 
his contemporaries is the fact that they have brains 
as well as heart. Although Trollope wrote in the 
days when Girton and Newnham were not, Lily 
Dale, Lucy Robarts, Mary Thorne, and all the rest 
of the numerous group, are perfectly sensible as 
well as lovable. " On pouvait les marier toutes," 
as Sardou said of his ingenues, for a different rea- 
son. Lily Dale deserves to rank as the chief of 
bis girl heroines, and in the telling of her love-story 
Trollope did some of his best work. She appears 
in two books ; the second, " The Last Chronicles of 
Barset," being perhaps Trollope's masterpiece. She 
was a favorite with his readers, though not with 
him. He tells us that he considered her somewhat 
of a prig ; but then we know that Thackeray 
entertained a similar opinion concerning Colonel 
Esmond. Her story is simple enough. Her lover 
jilts her that he may make a more advantageous 
marriage. The deserted maiden is usually an ex- 
cuse for the sentimental in literature ; but Trollope 
steers clear of everything of the sort, and there is 
not much in realistic fiction which shows so strong

and yet so delicate a tonch as his treatment of 
the girl's snfFering under the shame of the blow. 
Dorothy Stanbary in •• He Knew He was Right " 
ia a slighter, and an intentionally colorless sketch, bat 
•tands oat as worthy oar remembrance through her 
"fine speech to the man whom she does not dare to 
hope may be her lover, — a speech which condenses 
into a single phrase a good deal of knowledge of 
affairs feminine. The delightful Madeline Stan- 
hope — Madame Vesey-Neroni — in " Barchester 
Towers " is a sketch of another order, by no means 
lacking in color ; and Amelia Roper, in " The Small 
House at Atlington," is capital. The under-bred 
young woman of the London boarding-house, with 
her designs upon Johnny Eames, is so life-like that 
in reading of her one cannot but recall Trollope's 
account of the episode in his own days of early 
«lerkhood, when the elderly woman with the basket 
on her arm walked into the room at the Post Office 
and demanded audibly of the recreant she was seek- 
ing. " Anthony Trollope, when are you going to 
marry my daughter ? " In the two •• Phineas " 
Tolnmes. — the parliamentary novels which are still 
our beet political stories, even though Trollope over- 
estimated them in ranking them higher than his 
clerical novels, — we have the most interesting of 
his women, and the only one whose problem 
Trollope chose to make somewhat complex. Ladv 
Laura rejects the love offered her, choosing, though 
not wholly selfishly, wealth and position instead ; and 
makes shipwreck of her life in consequence. The 
skill with which Trollope has shown the strength 
of the woman's passion for the man she would fain 
persuade herself she regards as a friend ; her misery 
at realizing that his facile love has gone from her, 
and that he is entirely content with the position 
allotted him ; the utter abandonment of her grief 
when he finally passes out of her life, — the combi- 
nation of power and delicacy in his management of 
this theme, osnally left to writers distinctly not 
rir^inibus pverisjue, is something unique in the 
fiction of the period when novelists had not yet 
shaken off the timidity inherited from an age so 
awkwardly squeamish as to necessitate Mrs. Brown- 
ing's being "turned out of the ' Cornhill ' for 
indecency." 

The present generation of readers has much to 
be grateful for in the restoration of Anthony 
Trollope. Forty novels, none of them poor and 
many admirable, are a treasure-trove indeed. Bat 
the gain is for the coming writers as well. After 
the various dilutions of Scott and Damas have quit« 
lived out their hour, the field will again belong 
to the novel in its less boisterous aspects. Said 
George Moore, in one of his characteristic criti- 
cisms. '• Henry James went abroad and read Tar- 
genieff: Mr. Howells staid at home and read 
Henry James." The practice seems to have been pro- 
ductive of sufficiently good results, and is worth rec- 
ommending. The novelists of to-morrow have much 
to gain by reading Anthony Trollope. jj^ p.

That theme of perennial interest, the per- 
Bonality of a great man, furnishes Mr. Sidney 
Whitman with material for a very attractive 
book in his "Personal Reminiscences of Prince 
Bismarck." Although these glimpses of the 
Iron Chancellor offer little that is new, one 
gladly welcomes so able a presentation, with 
amplification and detail, of the old. Mr. 
Whitman's acquaintance with Bismarck began 
a short time before the latter's retirement from 
office, and we are told that he visited the great 
statesman no fewer than ten times between 
1891 and 1898, being in fact the only English- 
man now living who enjoyed anything like an 
intimate acquaintance with him. He seems to 
have come completely under the spell of Bis- 
marck's magnetic personality, and he writes in 
terms of enthusiastic admiration of the man, 
warmly defending him against all assault and 
disparagement. Again and again his indigna- 
tion speaks out at the shabby treatment ac- 
corded the unifier of Germany by an ungrate- 
ful sovereign and that sovereign's retainers. 
It is this spirit of championship that gives the 
book a note of fervor and helps to raise it above 
the grade of hack work to which such memora- 
biUa too often belong. Incidentally the writer 
dwells on the imperfect state of unification 
which he sees in the still youthful Empire, as 
contrasted with the more settled order of things 
in England, France, and the United States. 
The socialist peril he holds to be especially 
threatening there, because of this imperfect 
solidarity and stability. 

No one can contemplate Bismarck's closing 
years without admiring the greatness of soul, 
the imperturbable calm, with which, on the 
whole, he accepted his retirement to private 
life and refused to be embittered by what most 
have seemed to him ingratitude and malignity. 
His conversation, as reported to us, is never 
sour, no offensive personalities are indulged in, 
no trace of repining or resentment mars the 
dignity of his utterance. Some excerpts from 
his friendly chat with Mr. Whitman will best 
serve to illustrate the character of the book. 
Speaking of the routine of court life, he related 
the following : 

" It was ocea^onaUy one of my fanctions to present

all sorts of people to the King, and it now and then 
happened that my head was so full of more important 
matters that the very name of the person I was about 
to present lapsed from my memory. When that was 
the case I used to put a bold face upon it, and there 
being no time to inquire after names, I bluntly presented 
a man I did not know as Count Solms. You see, there 
are so many Count Solms that the King could not pos- 
sibly know them all by sight. On the other hand, a 
man whose name might be MUller or Schnlze was not 
likely to take it very much amiss if he were presented 
as Count Solms, which, after all, is a good family name. 
I got oat of my difficulty in this manner on more than 
one occasion, and it never failed." 

Of his old friend Motley he always spoke 
with tenderness. It must be explained, as 
bearing on what follows, that, by a curious in- 
terchange of linguistic courtesies, he talked 
in English with Mr. Whitman, who replied in 
German. After some allusion to Motley's 
singularly ideal and lofty character, Bismarck 
was asked if Motley was not of rather delicate 
physique ; to which he replied : 

" Oh, no, scarcely delicate; but his was a sensitively 
nervous organization. A few glasses of wine soon made 
him lively. And then he would lean back in his chair 
and, with bis hands under his coat behind his back, he 
would recall his favorite song of the student days we 
spent together at Gottingen. 

" ' In good old colony times, 

When we lived under a king, 
Three roguish chaps 
Fell into mishaps 
Because they could not sing,' etc." 

Presently follows another rollicking bit of 
English verse, which the Countess Rantzau 
joined her father in repeating with great gusto. 
The daughter added that her father remem- 
bered many more rhymes which he learned 
from his English and American fellow students 
at Gottingen. 

The author indulges in a page or more of 
curiously strenuous protest against the charge 
that his country, England, is lapsing into the 
cold-water habit, and he complacently closes 
the argument for the defense by recording that 
Bismarck smiled approvingly at the patriotic 
fervor with which he attested his country's 
bibulous propensities ; all of which would do 
very well for bierkneipe oratory, but looks 
strange in sober print. 

An item of some interest concerning the 
lately deceased Chevalier de Blowitz is worth 
quoting here. 

" I had long harbored an idea that the real hero of 
the Berlin Congress was neither Prince Bismarck nor 
Lord Beaconsfleld, but the Chevalier de Blowitz. For 
whereas Bismarck had only played the uninteresting 
part of an ' honest broker ' and Lord Beaconsfleld had 
been obliged to rest satisfied with a compromise with 
Russia, the gifted correspondent of the Times achieved 



next to the impossible; he surpassed himself. He beat 
his own record by sending the Berlin Treaty to the 
Times before the original draft was even signed. What 
Prince Bismarck told me at Varzin confirmed me in my 
surmise as to the prominent part played by this prince 
of journalists at the Congress." 

For this exploit the enterprising journalist 
received from the Prussian government the 
second class of the Order of the Crown, an 
unprecedented distinction. 

The recent exchange of Germany's position 
in Zanzibar for the island of Heligoland met 
with Bismarck's strong disapproval. He re- 
garded the island as not worth the heavy ex- 
pense necessary to put it into a defensible 
condition. Its possession by England had pre- 
vented its use as a coaling station by any con- 
tinental power, which explains why in 1870 
the operations of the French navy were so in- 
effective, the fleet being obliged to return re- 
peatedly to a French port to coal. On the 
subject of South Africa, when asked whether 
he had ever said that quarter of the globe 
might yet be the scene of a life-and-death 
struggle for the British Empire, Bismarck 
replied that he did not remember having said 
so, but he might have thought it. That was 
nearly twelve years ago. Toward Gladstone 
he expressed not the slightest personal dislike, 
but confined himself to the humorous intima- 
tion that his English contemporary was wont 
to quibble with words and had ended by be- 
coming their victim. Mr. Gladstone's feeling 
for Bismarck is thought to have been less free 
from acrimony. Bismarck felt great admira- 
tion for Carlyle, who reciprocated the sen- 
timent, extolling the German statesman as a 
" monster of industry." Of Max Miiller his 
great countryman had a poor opinion, holding 
him to be an overrated man. The learned 
scholar's dabbling in politics condemned him 
in the other's eyes. 

The account of Bismarck's eightieth-birthday 
celebration gives a good idea of his popularity. 
Besides the throngs that paid him homage in 
person, nearly half a million letters and more 
than ten thousand telegrams came pouring in 
upon him. Both the Reichstag, however, and 
the Berlin Town Council voted not to send him 
a congratulatory message. Whence they took 
their note it is not hard to surmise ; but Bis- 
marck turned the tables very cleverly by the 
neat wording of his answer to the Emperor's 
telegram expressing indignation at the Reich- 
stag's conduct. He assured the Kaiser that the 
action of his opponents had proved a source of

special gratification to him by calling forth his 
Majesty's gracious words of sympathy. The 
academic honors conferred upon the nation's 
hero on this occasion, as well as before and 
after, must amuse the non- German reader. He 
was made first a doctor of philosophy by the 
University of Halle ; then a doctor of laws by 
Gottingen, and later by Erlangen ; next a doc- 
tor of political science by Tiibingen ; Giessen 
surpassed her academic sisters by conferring 
on him the doctorate of theology ; and finally 
Jena did herself proud by making him a doctor 
beyond all possibility of a doubt, — a doctor of 
medicine. 

The reader will close Mr. Whitman's book, 
after some hours in the company of a truly 
gentle and refined as well as masterful and 
courageous nature, much inclined to hold him 
worthy of all the honors he received. A new 
emphasis has been placed upon those warmly 
human qualities for which the Iron Chancellor, 
despite his nickname, must always be an object 
of interest and, to many of his countrymen, of 
affection. The book is unquestionably a valu- 
able addition to the already extensive and still 
increasing mass of Bismarckiana. A German 
edition appears simultaneously with the En- 
glish, and some features of the author's English 
style would almost suggest that he had written 
the work originally in German and then given 
as a translation. However that may be, his 
early education in Germany will explain the 
occasional Teutonisms, — as, for instance, " to 
hold a speech." and " is " for " has been " to 
denote a past state continued into the present. It 
would be too harsh to call the writer a linguistic 
orphan, without a mother tongue, because he 
has grown up speaking several languages ; but 
all who are thus reared tend to use language 
as an implement rather than as an organ. A 
little less rhetorical confectionery here and 
there in the volume, and the omission of the 
solemn Amen at its close, would have done the 
book no harm in the eyes of plain people like 
the present reviewer. ,, -r- t>

A VOLUME on " Horace Walpole and the Strawberry 
Hill Press," by Mr. Mnnson Aldrieh Havens, is the first 
in a aeries of monographs on " Famous Presses," pro- 
jected by Mr. Lewis fiuddy of the Kirgate Press. It 
is an interesting essay, of a purely descriptive sort, 
illustrated with reproductions of Strawberry Hill title- 
pages and excellent portraits of Walpole and his prin- 
ter, Thomas Kirgate. The volume is printed on hand- 
made paper, in an edidon limited to three hundred 
«opies. 



Since the " English Men of Letters " series 
took a new lease of life last summer, the vol- 
umes have followed one another in rapid sao- 
cession. In addition to the three that we re- 
yiewed some time ago, no less than four othera 
now call for attention. We will begin with a 
few words about the " Tennyson " volume, 
which has been prepared by Sir Alfred Lyall. 
It was no easy matter to write appropriately of 
the great Victorian poet. Originality of treat- 
ment could hardly be hoped for, considering 
the amount of critical attention that has been 
lavished upon Tennyson by other writers, and 
considering also the fact that several other 
books of about the same size and scope as the 
present one are already in existence. But Mr. 
Morley's series was bound to include a " Tenny- 
son " just as it is bound some time to include 
the " Shakespeare " thus far omitted, and a 
reading of Sir Alfred's volume shows that the 
author has performed his task gracefully and 
with delicate sympathy. In particular, he gives 
due attention to Tennyson's philosophy, as well 
as to the dramatic section of his work, so often 
imperfectly appreciated, and to the poems of 
his last years, so often underrated. The anthor 
is slightly hypercritical at times, as when he 
speaks of the verse, 

" Unirenal Oeeaa softly washine all her warleas Uea," 
and calls it " logically perplexing " to suggest 
that " the sea would become calm when the 
land should be at peace." English poetry 
would be much the poorer were all its pathetic 
fallacies ruled oat of court. Misquotations also 
occur, as " Home they brought their warrior 
dead," and " Many a night I saw the Pleiades," 
in which latter instance the metre is rained by 
the extra syllable. 

Sir Alfred's difficulty was found in the fact 
that his work had been done by other writers 
so many times before ; the difficulty of Mr. 
Frederic Harrison, in preparing the " Ruskin" 
volume for this series, was found in the fact 
that he himself had written and published else- 
where the greater part of what such a work as 
the present must include. We doubt, however,

if a better man could have been discovered for 
the task, and are quite willing to overlook Mr. 
Harrison's inevitable repetitions of himself. 
He is peculiarly fitted to write about Ruskin 
because, on the one hand, his sympathy is un- 
failing, and, on the other, he can bring to the 
many subjects which Ruskin discussed a degree 
of sound knowledge which enables him to state 
clearly the many logical defects of the series of 
books that extends from " Modern Painters " 
to " Praeterita." The following sentence is 
typical of Mr. Harrison's treatment: "Original 
and heterodox as his science was, we come from 
time to time on intuitions of scientific truth, 
which strike us like those we meet in the 
poetry of Shakespeare or of Goethe." What 
is said from the standpoint of personal ac- 
quaintance with Ruskin is singularly charming 
and felicitous. We quote two passages. 

"I have talked with Carlyle and Tennyson, with 
Victor Hugo and Mazzini, with Garibaldi and with 
Gambetta, with John Bright and with Robert Browning, 
but no one of these ever impressed me more vividly with 
a sense of intense personality, with the inexplicable light 
of genius which seemed to well up spontaneously from 
heart and brain. It remains a psychological puzzle 
how one who could write with passion and scorn such 
as Carlyle and Byron never reached, who in print was 
so often Athanasius contra mundum, who opened every 
written assertion with ' I know,' was in private life one 
of the gentlest, gayest, humblest of men." 

Our second quotation is this beautiful account 
of the evening of Ruskin's life : 

" So, eleven years later, but a year or so before his 
death, I found him in his quiet Brantwood home, — to 
look at just like Lear in the last scene, but perfectly 
reposeful, gentle, and happy, taking the air of the fells 
with delight, joining in games or reading with the family 
at intervals, but for the most part sitting in his library 
and softly turning over the pages of a poem, a tale of 
Walter Scott or Dickeus, or some illustrated volume 
of views, himself in a bower of roses and gay flowers; 
silently and for long intervals together gazing with a 
far-off look of yearning, but no longer of eagerness, at 
the blue hills of the Coniston Old Man, across the rip- 
pling lake, as if — half child again, half wayworn pil- 
grim — he saw there the Delectable Mountains where 
the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at 
rest." 

Mr. Harrison, as we all know, has the amiable 
weakness of preaching Comtism and the relig- 
ion of humanity both in and out of season, 
and the reader of this volume must be pre- 
pared to learn that Ruskin was an unconscious 
Comtist all the while ; on the whole, we are 
rather inclined to thank the author for not hav- 
ing labored this point as much as was to be 
expected. 

The choice of Mr. Austin Dobson for the 
volume devoted to Samuel Richardson is quite 



unexceptionable. No one knows the literature 
and the life of the eighteenth century better 
than he, no one is more scrupulously accurate 
in statement, more skilful in the marshalling 
of facts, or more pleasing as a writer of biog- 
raphy mingled with criticism. In the present 
case, he has made a dull subject fairly inter- 
esting, for the life of Richardson is certainly 
material of a rather unpromising sort. The 
critical study of his writings is another matter, 
and the study of their place in the historical de- 
velopment of the modern novel ; but the limits 
of the series do not allow much philosophizing, 
and the author has had to keep himself under 
close restraint. We quote the brief passage 
in which he compares the three novels. 

" That ' Clarissa ' is Richardson's masterpiece, there 
can be no doubt. For ' Pamela ' is but an incondite 
production, which really ends in the second of its four 
volumes, while in ' Grandison,' though the manner is 
perfected, and the method matured, the movement of 
the story for the most part advances no more than a 
rocking-horse. But in ' Clarissa ' the simplicity of the 
central idea, the nnhasting yet unresting evolution of 
the tragedy, and, above all, the extraordinary ability 
exhibited in the portraiture of the two leading person- 
ages, raise it immeasurably above either its forerunner 
or its successor." 

For many years, Hawthorne has remained 
the only American included in the series of 
biographies now under consideration. The 
editor and publishers have now, however, let 
down the bars, and arranged for the admission 
of a number of volumes upon American au- 
thors, entrusting their preparation to American 
hands. The first of these new American vol- 
umes is devoted to Whittier, and is written by 
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson. The 
author has the advantage of having known 
Whittier well for many years, of having him- 
self lived in the locality with which the poet is 
chiefly identified, and of having been a fellow- 
worker with him in the abolitionist movement 
and in other philanthropic causes. He makes 
extensive use of Mr. Pickard's biography, and 
supplements the facts thus credited by means 
of lengthy extracts from " Snowbound " and 
other poems of a distinctly autobiographical 
character. Extracts from Whittier's writings 
in prose and verse make up a large part of 
the volume. Our chief criticism of the work 
must be that the poet is rather obscured by 
the reformer ; we do not get from it anything 
like an adequate discussion of Whittier's 
poetry. 

To a certain extent this criticism also holds 
of the account of Longfellow which Colonel 
Higginson has just published in the series of 



1903.]

" American Men of Letters," and illustrates 
the disadvantage of knowing one's subject too 
welL In both cases, personal matters seem to 
have so crowded upon the author's interest 
as to restrict the space that might fairly have 
been claimed for the consideration of literary 
achievement. But the books of the American 
are larger than those of the English series, so 
that there is less cause for complaint on the 
score of inadequacy. Here, as in the previous 
instance, the author has relied largely upon the 
standard biography of the poet, but he has also 
had other sources of information, hitherto not 
much exploited. These are specified as the 
correspondence of the first Mrs. Longfellow, 
certain manuscript volumes known as the 
" Harvard College Papers," and a collection 
of the poet's own early writings not included 
in the standard editions. There is also, as a 
matter of course, the contribution of personal 
acquaintance, although the author's association 
with Longfellow was less intimate than with 
Whittier. A few sentences from the conclud- 
ing paragraph of this book are worth quoting. 
" It will perhaps be found, as time goes on, that the 
greatest service rendered by Longfellow — beyond all 
personal awakening or stimulns exerted on his readers 
— was that of being the first conspicnous representa- 
tive, in an eminently practical and hard-working com- 
munity, of the literary life. One of a circle of enperior 
men, he was the only one who stood for that life purely 
and snpremely, and thus indicated its national impor- 
tance. . . . Considered merely as an antidote to mate- 
rialism, such a life was of incalculable value. Looking 
at him, the reign of the purely materialistic, however 
much aided by organizing genius, was plainly self- 
limited; the modest career of Longfellow outshone it in 
the world's arena. Should that reign henceforth grow 
never so potent, the best offset to its most arrogant 
claims will be found, for years to come, in the memory 
of his name." 

Professor Woodberry's life of Poe, contrib- 
uted many years ago to the series of •' Amer- 
ican Men of Letters," bears the distinction of 
being the best of the dozen or more volumes 
published before the present resuscitation of 
the enterprise. Its only fault was a slight defect 
of sympathy, and this was more than counter- 
balanced by its painstaking thoroughness and 
its admirable critical insight. Against Profes- 
sor Woodberry's " Hawthorne," now published, 
no charge of defective sympathy is fairly to be 
laid, while the positive excellences are as con- 
spicuous as in the earlier work. There is pos- 
sibly a little too much of strictly bibliographical 
detail, such as the tracing of the many short 
stories through their successive forms of publi- 
cation, but this is not a serious matter. The 
author's style is always grave, well-poised, and 



pregnant with thought. We must quote a part 
of what he says about Hawthorne's two books 
of Greek legend. 

" A multitude of children have loved these books, 
for whom their very names are a part of the golden haze 
of memory; and, in view of the association of Haw- 
thorne's genius and temperament with quite other 
themes and the darker element in grown lives, this 
band of children makes a kind of halo round his figure. 
Whether the thing done should have been so done, 
whether Greek should have been turned into Gothie, 
is a foolish matter. To please a child is warrant enough 
for any work; and here romantic fancy plays arouud 
the beantifnl forms and noble suggestion of old heroic 
and divine life, and marries them to the hillside and 
fireside of New England childhood with the naturalnea* 
of a fairy enchantment; these tales are truly tranft- 
planted into the minds of the little ones with whose 
youngest tendrils of imagination they are intertwined. 
. . . If to wake and feed the imagination and charm 
it, and fill the budding mind with the true springtime 
of the soul's life in beautiful images, noble thoughts, 
and brooding moods that have in them the infinite sug- 
gestion, be success for a writer who would minister to- 
the childish heart, few books can be thought to equal 
these ; and the secret of it lies in the wandering sena» 
which Hawthorne had of the mystical in childhood, of 
that element of purity in being which is felt also in hi» 
reverence for womanhood, and which whether in child 
or woman, was typical of the purity of the soul itself — 
in a word, the spiritual sense of life." 

Such a passage as this illustrates, better than 
any descriptive comment, the gifts of sympathy 
and of literary art that the author has brought 
to this study of the greatest of American writers 
of imaginative prose.

Those garden-lovers who lived happy days 
in the pages of Miss Jekyll's " Wood and 
Garden " and " Home and Garden," and who 
found her " Lilies for English Gardens " so 
satisfying in its kind, will turn eagerly to her 
book on " Roses for English Gardens " with 
equal anticipation of pleasure and profit. But 
the book is disappointing ; a rose-lover says 
that all books on roses are disappointing, for 
they cannot approach the charm of the rose 
itself. The illustrations of this book are two 
hundred in number, and form a fine study of 
photography as well as of roses. The single 
large blooms of roses of whatever color are 
wonderfully good ; but when the entire rose- 
bush is given, be it in form a standard, a

natural bush, or a climber, there is much monot- 
ony of effect. The old garden roses, such as the 
Scotch roses, brier roses, the Madame Plantier, 
an old favorite, the damask rose, the Ayrshire 
Toses, with the oldest rose of all, Rosa Alba, 
form beautiful pictures. But when another 
flower is added, as in the lovely picture of 
White Lilies and Damask Roses, or of Roses 
and Larkspur, the artistic effect is wonderfully 
increased. The most interesting plates are 
those showing the roses trained upon old barns, 
•tree stumps, and waste and barren spots, turn- 
ing them into things of beauty. Miss Jekyll 
has a genius for that sort of thing, and her 
chapter upon " Roses for Converting Ugliness 
into Beauty " is an agreeable and valuable 
one. Mr. Mawley's share of the book can 
well be conveyed by giving his chapter head- 
ings : " Planting Roses," " Pruning Roses," 
*' Propagating Roses," " Enemies of the Rose," 
*' Exhibiting Roses," " Roses under Glass," 
*' Some Lists of the Best Roses for Various 
Uses." Prosaic titles these are, and of neces- 
sity treated with simplicity and plainness of 
speech, but treated with dignity, and, to the 
Tose-grower, with interest. The list of Garden 
Soses for various places and times is, of course, 
of little value to the American rose-grower. 
The dates are absolutely useless, and in many 
cases the roses named will not live at all in our 
Northern States. Of course this also holds 
true of Miss Jekyll's lists ; and for the Amer- 
ican rose-grower her book is no way as useful 
as Mr. Ellwanger's standard work on "The 
Kose." 

Miss Jekyll's pleasant and profitable advice 
as to rose pergolas, rose arches, rose pillars, 
rose screens, etc., is of course most grateful to 
read and useful to heed. So also is her chapter 
on Rose-Gardens — vexed question ! She is 
impatient, as are many, of the usual rose- 
garden, — a sort of target of concentric rings 
or other regular form, set upon turf, with little 
connected design with the remainder of the 
garden ; yet she gives little definite instruc- 
tion, save to have ever a background of ever- 
green trees of some kind for the roses to run 
upon, as cypress, yew, and holly. As neither 
of these three thrives with us, or indeed will 
hardly grow at all in many localities, this 
chapter also is of little value to Americans. 
Many of the roses of these English gardens 
will not grow here ; but we in turn have roses 
which are not even named in this book, — 
among them all the hearty sturdy roses of the 
Michigan sisterhood, the Baltimore Belle, 



Queen of the Prairie, Gem of the Prairie, and 
the single pink Michigan itself, roses that have 
all the vigor, stanchness, and freshness of the 
new world, of the prairie. 

While the platitudes of gardening have 
filled many of our recent garden-books and 
received ill-merited praise, it is regrettable 
that so deserving a work as " In a Tuscan 
Garden " should have received so little atten- 
tion. The book is a charming one, — well 
written, one of the best of the year upon what- 
ever subject ; full of interest, and of informa- 
tion on many topics besides gardening and 
flowers. It gives absolutely the best and most 
practical advice I have ever seen printed with 
regard to the relations between Italian land- 
lords and their tenants, especially English 
tenants ; and this from an experience of twenty 
years. The book would hence be invaluable 
to anyone intending an Italian residence in a 
rented villa. The snags and snares of domestic 
service, of housekeeping, of household arrange- 
ments, are set forth in so concise and direct 
a fashion, with such good advice added, that 
we are well equipped for action, and are in- 
structed while we are amused. One chapter, 
on " Tuscan Courts of Justice," is so informed 
with experience, so founded upon accuracy, so 
tempered with good sense, as to be of value 
far beyond the words of any ordinary legal 
adviser. But the book is not all useful infor- 
mation. In the chapter upon the treatment of 
animals in Italy, and the view taken of it by 
the Church, we welcome as friends the author's 
own pets, Jack the Persian cat, Rosina the 
parrot, and the glorious macaws, Madame 
Blue and her husband Alfredo, who, after ten 
years of affectionate ornithological matrimony 
of which he was the masculine part, actually 
laid an egg. This chapter is of the highest 
grade of humor, and of sincere pathos, too. 
As the print is very close and page margins 
narrow, the 415 pages of the book afford us 
many words upon an infinite variety of sub- 
jects. The finding, planting, and development 
of the garden is as satisfying from the point 
of sentiment as is the practical detailed advice 
upon gardens, upon the Mezzaria system of 
employment, the regard and study of climate, 
etc.; but the garden-part does not predominate, 
and it seems to be rather the book of a flower- 
lover, an out-of-door decorator and colorist, 
rather than of a practical gardener. The 
book has eight illustrations, of which three are 
of the garden, and are frankly commonplace ; 
one is amusingly ugly. I believe the photo-

graphs of all small Italian gardens are ngly, 
and even those glorious gardens of the great

well, in photographs. The camera loses their 
sentiment, their magic and mystery ; they look 
dingy, flowerless, and sodden.

Discrssioxs or the Trust.* 

At the present writing, there is a Inll in the 
agitation of the Trnst problem, although it still 
continues to occupy an important place in the 
public mind, and probably will continue to do 
so until remedial legislation takes place, or it 
is denMNisbated that such legislation is unwise 
or impoasiUe. While nothing new has been 
recently added in the way of legislative oontroL, 
much gain has been made in public sentiment 
through the realization that former legislation 
which sought in effect the destruction of the 
Trust and the prevention of combination was 
not only inadequate but futile and ill-advised. 
There is a better understanding of the Trust 
by legislators and by the public, which brings 
a sober second-thought that there are benefits 
in combination which may be turned to public 
service by proper legislative control. More- 
over, the economic principles involved in the 
question are coming to the front, and it is be- 
coming clearly understood that it is not merely 
the arbitrary ruling of a few men that must be 
considered, but the vital existence of the pres- 
ent economic system. While the question is 
better understood, the difficulties of the prob- 
lem have increased and have changed agitation 
into thoughtfulness and radicals to conserva- 
tives. 

The voluminous writings on this subject that 
have appeared in the form of books, magazine 
articles, and newspaper comment, have been a 
source of publicity and enlightenment. While 
it is nearly all recent, this literature is already 
mostly obsolete, because much of it was writ- 
ten without a full diagnosis of the case, and 
because of the constant shifting of the question 
as it has developed. The bibliography sent out

last year by the Library of Congress (edited 
by Mr. A. P. C. Griffin) contained something 
over 450 titles, nearly all of works that ap- 
peared within the last fifteen years. Much of 
this matter is superficial or fragmentary, but as 
a whole it fairly represents the subject. Since 
this bibliography was published, the contribu- 
tions to the discussion have continued to in- 
crease. There is to be noted a decided improve- 
ment in their tone and quality, which is a hopeful 
sign that we shall some day know more defi- 
nitely what may be and what may not be done, 
and arrive at a proper solution of the problem. 
Pending legislation is suggestive of a marked 
advance in rational thought on the subject, 
brought about in part by the report of the In- 
dustrial Commission and the investigation now 
being conducted by the commission on the 
Anthracite Coal-strike. 

It seems to be generally conceded that com- 
bination cannot be prevented ; that the Trust 
appears most frequently in the form of a great 
corporation ; that it has its advantages as well 
as its evils, and that legislation should seek to 
suppress its evils and enlarge and distribute its 
benefits. In order to do this, legislation should 
prevent the secret rebate on railroads, modify 
the tariff wherein it favors Trusts (wherever 
this can be done without crushing the inde- 
pendent producer), remove the "clubs" with 
which the combine seeks to destroy the in- 
dependent operator, remodel the corporation 
laws which were made for pygmies and not for 
giants, and insist on publicity of all corpora- 
tions for the protection of investors, producers, 
and operators. 

The two volumes referred to in this review are 
both valuable contributions to the literature of 
the Trust, but of widely different nature. So 
far as publicity and enlightenment go, they add 
much to the fund of information, although 
the opinions expressed by the authors are not 
always conclusive. The book of Mr. Bolen, 
" Plain Facts as to Trusts and the Tariff," is 
valuable as presenting in small compass all of 
the salient points relating to the Trust, and to 
the Tariff adso so far as this relates to the for- 
mer. As its title suggests, the work abounds 
in facts rather than in philosophy, although the 
author does not hesitate to express his opinion 
dogmatically and with force when occasion 
presents. After a rather brief review of the 
" Origin and Purpose " of the Trust, the au-

the most important being the one on " Remedies 
for the Evils of Trust Monopolies." "The 
Railroad Problem " receives a fair share of 
attention. The second part of the book is 
devoted to the Tariff. After presenting the 
usual arguments for and against it, the author 
points out conclusively the need of its reform. 
Copious notes are used throughout the work, 
which are chiefly filled with statistics. It is a 
thoroughly useful and interesting book, largely 
because it places fact above philosophy, and of- 
fers no panacea for ills inherent in the system. 

Entirely different in style and purpose is 
" The Trust : Its Book," written — appro- 
priately — by a " syndicate " for the purpose 
of showing the necessity and advantage of the 
Trust. Usually such books are not as satis- 
factory as those written by a single author, 
although in this instance each writer under- 
stands his subject well and presents it ener- 
getically from his own standpoint. The book 
emphasizes the importance of the Trust as an es- 
sential part of our industrial system, and shows 
its advantage as a productive agent. It shows, 
too, how the Trust reaches its roots deep down 
into our economic life. The chapters by Mr. 
Charles Flint, on " Combinations and Critics," 
"The Gospel of Industrial Steadiness," "The 
Trust, an Alliance of Work, Brains, and 
Money," and " What Combination has done 
for Labor and Capital," are remarkable in 
defining the nature of the service rendered by 
the Trust. Other chapters in the book sup- 
port this central idea, and picture the Trust 
as an essential product of our individualistic 
system of politics and economics. 

After reading both these books, one cannot 
fail to believe that it is not capital that people 
fear, for that is essential ; not centralization, 
for that is inevitable ; not monopoly, for that 
may be turned to serve the public ; but it is 
the evils of the Trust monopoly, the dangers 
of selfish greed, the exploitation of humanity 
for gain, political corruption through corporate 
cupidity, and the suppression of independent 
endeavor, that represent the real evils of the 
Trust as they exist to-day.

The one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, which occurs next May, will be sig- 
nalized by the appearance of the initial volumes in 
a complete and definitive " Centenary " edition of his 
works, from the press of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co., Emerson's authorized publishers. The most inter- 
esting feature of the edition will be the inclusion of one 
or two volumes of hitherto unpublished material. 



Recent Books on Music* 

" Grieg is never large or heroic ; he never wears the 
buskin. He has neither the depth of passion nor the 
intellectual grasp needed to make music in the grand 
style. Probably of all his peculiarities the most sig- 
nificant is the shortness of his phrases and his manner 
of repeating them almost literally, displaced a little in 
pitch, but not otherwise altered. Almost all his music 
can be cut up into segments two or four measures long, 
each segment complete in itself, an entire musical 
thought." 

The foregoing paragraph, relative to the musifr 
of Edvard Grieg, gives one a clear idea of 
the analytical ability shown by Mr. Daniel 
Gregory Mason in the studious work entitled 
" From Grieg to Brahms." In a prefatory 
note, the author seeks to show that all music^ 
no matter what its complexity on the technical 
side, is in essence an expression of personal 
feeling ; and as the qualities of a man's person- 
ality show themselves not only in his works, 
but in his acts, his words, his face, and his 
carriage even, it has seemed natural and fruit- 
ful, in these studies, to seek acquaintance with 
the musicians through acquaintance with the 
men. Therefore his essays on the art and ser- 
vices of Grieg, Dvorak, Saint-Saens, Franck, 
Tschaikowsky, and Brahms are a unique study 
of music through the personalities of the ar- 
tists treated. " If we would understand the in- 
dividual composers, we must have a sense of the 
scheme into which they fall, the great universal 
evolution of which they are but incidents." Ar- 
ranging them in the order of their influence 
on art, which depends upon their power both 
to assimilate previous resources and to add 
new ones, he passes " from Grieg to Brahms. "^ 
To give an idea of the principles worked out 
in this general plan of analysis, the author 
sketches in an introductory essay the musical 
environment, as determined by basic principle* 
and developed in history, in relation to which 
alone the individual discussed can be under- 
stood. When he tells us that Grieg has the 
quick and ardent temperament of Keats and

Stevenson ; shows us that Saint-Saens's ver- 
satility and energy are the salient traits of 
his typically Gallic nature ; that passing from 
Saint^Saens to Cesar Franck is like closing a 
volnme of Taine and taking up Maeterlinck ; 
shows that the nationality of Tschaikowsky's 
masic proves a priori that, however tinged it 
may be with personal melancholy, it is not ulti- 
mately pessimistical or destructive in efiEect — 
that he was not simply a neurasthenic Jeremiah 
with a faculty for orchestration : and that 
Brahms has Homeric simplicity and excels all 
his contemporaries in soundness and univer- 
sality, — when Mr. Mason makes these things 
clear to us, we realize at once that he is master 
of his subject. A closing essay on the meaning 
of music seeks to suggest that still larger en- 
vironment of human feeling and activity on 
which music, like everything else, depends for 
its vitality. The illustrations consist of por- 
traits of the composers mentioned. 

Mr. Philip H. Goepp's second volume on 
"Symphonies and their Meaning" completes 
the whole survey of classic symphonies. The 
first volume aimed to unravel the mystery of 
symphonies, — "to see what tonal meaning really 
mean^. and, quite as clearly, what it does not 
mean." The present work seeks to test the 
bidden truths in other classic symphonies that 
varied in their plan and quality, and finally to 
survey the entire field of the great tonal works 
of art. 

" There ia real truth in the STmbolism of the moral 
strife of individnal, of debate and dispute, drawing truth 
from the dregs, rising to final enlightenment. Every 
phase of life is here idealized. Again, the symbol has 
real trnth. Beauty, strength, each have their figures. 
The moral, not the external, life of man fiinds in music 
its full play and mirror. The true essence of life is in 
its emotions, and they play in tones as do fish in the 
waters. The highest problems are ethical, emotional, 
of experience ; science is but a lesser helpmeet. In music 
their utterance is so real that they seem to be them- 
selves in the life of the tonal stream. Given the type 
of pleading, of defiance, of plaint, of prayerful trust, of 
triumphant joy, — given all these, together with the full 
play of dispute and strife, and you have all the re- 
soarces, unconscious and therefore the more genuine 
and convincing, for the utterance of man's most vital 
thought. So you have in the Fifth Symphony actually 
as stirring a refrain of the same high truth as in the 
book of Job." 

These two volumes by Mr. Goepp are to be 
numbered among the classic works on music. 
Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelssohn, 
Brahms, and others, are here treated more 
lengthily than in any previous work. The au- 
thor has, with good discrimination and evidence 
of wide experience, chosen from the works of 



composers characteristic selections illustrative 
of the explanations given. Xone of the treatises 
on this particular branch of musical aesthetics 
DOW extant add much to the understanding of 
the subject, and the reason is that the writers 
have hitherto begun at the wrong end, whereas 
the present writer, by a judicious selection of 
art forms and rare analytical ability, has given 
us a comprehensive book of special value to all 
who look upon music as worthy of deep and 
serious thought. " Every bit of music has a 
home where it begins and where it ends, every 
melodic figure has its own nook and niche, and 
every idea of whatever symbolic guise has its 
own tonal vine and fig-tree." Whether de- 
scribing the bounds of tonal art in the " Pas- 
toral " of Beethoven, or that literal story of an 
artist's woes, Berlioz's " Fantastic Symphony," 
or Kichard Strauss' Ein Seldenleben, the au- 
thor holds his subject well in hand. He has 
produced a concise yet comprehensive history 
of a subject deeply interesting to musicians, if 
not to the general public. 

The average young American woman who 
dreams of cultivating her voice by taking a few 
lessons a week for a term or two at a mnsio- 
school might well heed the account given by 
Bontempi of the training given to pupils at the 
papal chapel about the middle of the seven- 
teenth century. One hour a day was devoted to 
the singing of difficult passages, a second to the 
practice of the thrill, a third to pure intona- 
tion, — all in the presence of the teacher, and 
with the help of a mirror, to avoid grimaces and 
observe the motion of the tongue and mouth> 
Besides these, several hours were devoted to the 
study of expression, several more to practice 
on the piano, composition, and the theory of 
music ; and frequent opportunity was given to 
sing in church, while the Monte Mario was 
visited in order that the pupils might hear the 
echo of their voices and thereby study their 
own faults. In a monograph entitled " How 
to Sing " Madame Lilli Lehmann indicates 
the difficulties which result from the hurried 
cultivation of the voice. She points out that 
in former times eight years were devoted to 
the study of singing, — at the Prague Conser- 
vatory, for instance, — before a pupil became 
proficient. To-day artists are turned out in 
" factories," that is, in so-called conservatories, 
or by teachers who give lessons ten or twelve 
hours a day. " In two years they receive a cer- 
tificate of competence, or at least the diploma 
of the ' factory.' The latter I consider a crime 
that the state should prohibit." She adds that

not until artists reach the point where they can 
take council with each other about their mis- 
takes and deficiencies, and discuss the means 
for overcomiug them, will bad singing and in- 
artistic effort be checked and the art of singing 
come into its " rights " again. The author has 
been on the stage since her eighteenth year, — 
that is, for thirty-four years, — appearing as a 
star in Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, 
England, and Sweden. For many years she has 
been devoting herself to the important questions 
relating to singing ; and in the work before us 
she has given us the result of her researches. 

" It has been my endeavor to set down as clearly 
as possible all that I have learned through zealous, 
conscientious study by myself and with others, and 
thereby to offer to my colleagues something that will 
bring order into the chaos of their methods of singing; 
something based on science as well as on sensations in 
singing; something that will bring expressions often 
misunderstood into clear relation with the exact func- 
tions of the vocal organs." 

The various chapters in her work are devoted 
to such subjects as the singer's physiological 
studies, nasal singing, position of the tongue, 
the sensation of the resonance of the head cavi- 
ties, development and equalization, the tremolo, 
and practical exercises. Numerous plates 
are interspersed throughout the work, and 
are so drawn as to be of sufficient aid to vocal 
aspirants as to make her treatise a suitable text 
for the use of conservatories and teachers. 

"Reminiscences — Musical and Otherwise," 
by Miss Fanny Reed, is devoted chiefly to recol- 
lections of celebrities with whom the author has 
been intimately acquainted, including Liszt, 
Paul Deschanel, Madeline Lemaire, Coquelin, 
Massenet, and Paderewski. As she says, her 
" stream of chance " seems to have flowed in an 
unusual course, and, carrying her beyond the 
prosaic existence of many New England girls, 
brought her into the delightful salons of the 
Old World, whose presiding spirits are beacon- 
lights in music, literature, and art. When we 
consider Miss Reed's ability, we cannot help 
adding that these sketches are a trifle too lau- 
datory. True, she has sketched her subjects 
as she has known them ; but we miss that 
intersprinkling of criticism which serves to illu- 
minate any record of events and give it pro- 
portion. Is it not frequently the case that in 
books such as this, when handled by able critics, 
it is too often laid down as a general prin- 
ciple that the legitimate use of comparisons 
stops at illustration and characterization ? It is 
as a racy, gossipy book for the general reader 
that Miss Reed's work will be appreciated. 



The reproductions of autographed photographs 
make attractive illustrations. 

" The nineteenth century was the period of achieve- 
ment; there is every reason to believe that the 
twentieth century will be the period of still nobler ac- 
chievement. . . . During the era we are entering no 
unworthy teacher will be permitted to trifle with the 
unfolding musical instincts of childhood. The study of 
music will take an honored place in the curriculum of 
every school, academy, college, and university, as an 
essential factor in culture." 

Such is the prefatory note to a series of prac- 
tical essays on music, entitled " For Every 
Music Lover," by Mrs. Aubertine Woodward 
Moore (" Auber Forestier"). The author is a 
scholarly pianist, and a practitioner as well as 
a theorist. She is well known as a pioneer in 
the field of illustrated talks on music, and these 
essays, which have not previously appeared in 
print, are composed, to a large extent, of ma- 
terials used by the author in her public and 
private lectures on the history and theory of 
music. An idea of the scope of her work may 
be gleaned from the title chapters : " The 
Origin and Function of Music," " Blunders in 
Music Study," "The Musical Education that 
Educates," " How to Interpret Music," " How 
to Listen to Music," "The Poetry and Lead- 
ership of Chopin," "Violins and Violinists — 
Fact and Fable," "Queens of Song," "The 
Opera and its Reformers," "Famous Orato- 
rios," and " Symphony and Symphonic Poem." 
The knowledge of technique and mature judg- 
ment displayed in the volume promises to bring 
to it the success enjoyed by the author's pre- 
vious work published two years ago, which 
tended to show how music may gain its rightful 
place as a beneficent influence in daily life. 
Needless to say, Mrs. Moore is eminently fitted 
to treat her subject with authority. 

In a prefatory note to " The Story of Ora- 
torio " Miss Annie W. Patterson points out that 
if the average " musical man " is asked what 
an oratorio is, he will reply : " Oh, the Messiah 
is an oratorio. It is a great work, you know — 
for chorus, band, and big singers — and we hear 
it at least once a year — generally about Christ- 
mas time "; and the definition ends. Of all 
musical forms, the oratorio has the distinction 
of being the noblest and most ennobling. Miss 
Patterson has endeavored to write a connected 
narrative touching upon all the phases in the 
history of this particular form of musical art, — 
from its first dawn in the music of religious 
devotion to its climax in the masterpieces of 
Handel and Mendelssohn, — yet free from dry 
statistics, unnecessary detail, and parenthetical

information. The namber of works classed un- 
der the heading of oratorio is very mislead- 
intr — Schomann's profane oratorio, "Paradise 
and the Peri,"' is pointed out as an unique ex- 
ample ; therefore, only those works the texts of 
which were drawn from biblical narrative or 
episode are included in the present treatise. 
The "Messiah," "Creation," and "Redemp- 
tion " are not included in the same category as 
such famous masses as the " Lobgesang " of 
Mendelssohn and the " Deutsches Requiem " 
of Brahms. Miss Patterson's style of narration, 
while not brilliant, is clear and forcible. Her 
most conspicuous fault is, perhaps, a too favor- 
able estimate of mediocrity. The last two chap- 
ters in the book are addressed especially to 
professional musical students. It is worthy of 
note that the work contains a complete and ac- 
curate appendix and index.

etraoatwm. ^^^ jjjg faculty of provoking dissent, 

his views on practically all political topics being 
held with an uncompromising vigor and consistency. 
As an open advocate of the once forgotten tenets 
enanciated by Alexander Hamilton, he is one of 
the foremost promulgators in .the public life of 
America to-day of dostrines and tendencies holding 
with the practical politicians of the Old World 
rather than with the theorists and idealists of the 
New. He is therefore held to stand with the con- 
servative side of our national life, though his teach- 
ings are in most respects radical in the extreme 
when contrasted with the principles on which our 
government was founded. But he is always provo- 
cative of thought, and in nothing he has written 
more than in '• A Fighting Frigate, and Other 
Essays and Addresses" (Scribner), containing in a 
single volume the work already given to the public 
in the form of magazine articles or public speeches 
on formal occasions, written or delivered within the 
last five years. Necessarily the subjects are all 
congenial ones, and contain a practical exposition 
of Mr. Lodge's political and ethical philosophy. In 
the address from which the book borrows its name, 
given at the celebration of the return of the old 
" Constitution " to the navy yard at Charlestown in 
1897, may be read this characteristic statement, for 
example : 

" The Tirtaes tenned ' a^Tage ' I take to be the early and 
primary ones of courage, indiffeienee to danger, and loyalty 
to the tribes or clans which, in the prowmi of time, became 
nationa and eonntrieo. . . . The gentler rirtaes, as well as 
the lefinementa and graces of cirilization, rest npon these 
simpler qoalities ; and the highest achieTements of the race 



in the arts of peace hare come from the strong, bold nations 
of the earth. Art, Uteratare, philosophy, invention, in Graeee 
and Rome, in Venice and Holland, all reached their aeaith 
when those countries were at the height of their military and 
political power, and sank as that power decayed." 

Mr. Lodge does not mention the fact, but it would 
be doubtful whether such ■' strong, bold nations " as 
the Tartars and Turks, the Spaniards, or even the 
earlier Scythians and Gaols, can be set in sneeeM- 
ful contrast with the ideals of civilization emM|riBg 
from Palestine and Ceylon when neither of those 
countries could by any trick of speech be exalted 
into " strong, bold nations " in Mr. Lodge's sense 
of the words. Nor does he seem to be in accord 
with the teachings of evolution in regard to the 
higher value of intellect and morality as distin- 
guished from his approved '• savage virtues "; and 
he certainly does not make the point that decadence 
follows upon the attainment of " military and polit- 
ical power " of necessity, while national righteous- 
ness has been a conservator of national energy, and 
has enabled the effort wasted in war to manifest 
itself in peace. One wonders, also, how he can 
reconcile the Anglo-Saxon supremacy which he 
holds in such high estimation with the lower position 
taken by nations that have turned themselves into 
armed camps. The rest of the book is given up to 
extolling the great Federalists of the earlier days 
of the republic, John Marshall, Oliver Ellsworth, 
and Daniel "Webster ; to addresses upon three gov- 
ernors of Massachusetts, Greenhalge, Robinson, 
and Wolcott ; to an inquiry into the treaty-making 
powers of the Senate ; to some rather scratchy im- 
pressions of Russia ; and to the speech made at the 
unveiling of the statue of Rochambeau in Washing- 
ton last May. There is scholarship and vigor in 
these essays and addresses, but there is little 
Christianity, so far as ideals are concerned.

There is but one Paris. It is 
neither a seaport nor a centre of 
commerce. Its location has always 
been far enough inland to allow it to develop its 
own resources and characteristics unimpeded by the 
forces that inevitably encroach on the individuality 
of seaport cities. No one can understand or prop- 
erly estimate such a unique metropolis who has not 
lived with it through several seasons. Mr. Henry 
Haynie's two volimnes on " Paris, Past and Present " 
(Stokes) are the result of long and intimate ao- 
quaintanee with Paris and the Parisian. Twenty 
years of sojourning within her fortifications gave 
him more than he could find in books and libraries. 
With evident enthusiasm for his task, and a desire 
to pack as much information as possible between 
the lids of these volumes, he has gone into the his- 
tory of the city from the time the Romans en- 
camped on the " De de la Cite " down to the pres- 
ent. Naturally, there had to be severe condensation 
in every part ; and this fact makes the reading of 
Uiose chapters that deal with the city's history very 
fragmentary and unsatisfactory. But this deficiency 



154 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



is relieved as soon as the author sets about describing 
the great institutions of to-day. Each of these is 
traced in its historical connections, and in its pres- 
ent position in political, religious, or educational 
Paris. It is apparent from the start that we are to 
have a roseate picture painted by an adorer of the 
French capital. While recognizing that there are 
in it things to be censured, the author's admirable 
method of sketching and coloring very greatly min- 
imizes that fact. He describes with ample detail, and 
in plain and lucid language, public buildings, parks, 
monuments, educational institutions, the govern- 
ment, and even the sewer system. His admiration 
for the city, and his inability to render a harsh judg- 
ment, may be seen in the following statement : " In 
all things and in everything, Paris is most beautiful, 
most lovely, most adorable, most intelligent. ... In 
all that relates to intellectual, industrial, and social 
life, the preeminence of Paris is incontestible, and 
uncontested " (vol. II., p. 236 ). The author's pains- 
taking description of the most notable institutions of 
the city is beautifully supplemented by twenty-four 
photogravures and thirty-two half-tones in the text. 
One or two good maps would add to the interest and 
value of the book. 

"The Blood of the Nation," by 
Z'^^.'j^dZ'. President David Starr Jordan, is a 

small book published by the Amer- 
ican Unitarian Association. Small it is, but weighty, 
for its contents form one of the most impressive ser- 
mons ever preached against militarism. Dr. Jordan 
writes of the wickedness of warfare from the 
standpoint of the Christian moralist, it is true, but 
his argument does not waste itself in the usual 
abstractions, for it is reinforced by the message 
of science, for which the author is an accredited 
spokesman. " The blood of a nation determines its 
history " and " The history of a nation determines 
its blood." These are the two main propositions of 
the book, but it is to the second of them, because 
the less obvious of the two, that attention is chiefly 
directed. The lesson is drawn from the history of 
the military peoples in both ancient and modern 
times that a nation becomes irredeemably weak- 
ened that sends forth its best to die on the battle- 
field. The next generation is made up of the 
descendants of the weaklings who have not been 
fit to fight. This is a simple enough lesson, and 
demonstrably true, but the world stubbornly re- 
fuses to recognize it, and most countries continue 
in their insane exaltation of the military spirit and 
the tinsel glory that comes from warfare. Dr. 
Jordan quotes from the poets to excellent effect, 
although we cannot account for his calling Oscar 
Wilde's " Ave Imperatrix " " the last flicker of dy- 
ing genius in his wretched life," or for his saying 
that "in the late war some poet, addressing the 
spirit of ancient Greece, appealed to her, — ' of all 
thy thousands grant us three To make a new Ther- 
mopylw.' " The poet was Byron (who is misquoted), 
and the " late war " was that of the early nineteenth

century. — Another little book by Dr. Jordan, pub- 
lished by Messrs. Elder & Shepard, is called " The 
Philosophy of Despair." Taking FitzGerald's Omar 
for his text, the author proceeds to " indicate some 
part of the answer of Science to the Philosophy of 
Despair." But he is no optimist of the shallow sort, 
and does not blink the very real problem, or seek 
to glaze it over by comforting platitudes. He takes 
what we believe to be the only possible stand 
against philosophical pessimism when he deals with 
it as a matter of temperament rather than of logic, 
and insists that healthful activity is in itself happi- 
ness, and not a process whereby happiness is to be 
attained in some future time. " Such an expression 
as ' worth living ' kas in fact no real meaning. To 
act and to love are the twin functions of the human 
body and soul. To live effectively implies the belief 
that life is worth living, and no one who leads a 
worthy life has ever for a moment doubted this." 
This last sentence may possibly make too sweeping 
a claim, but we have much sympathy for the gen- 
eral tenor of Dr. Jordan's thought, and believe that 
his little book is of the most helpful kind — espe- 
cially to young men and women who are passing 
through the early stages of the inevitable disillu- 
sionment that comes somewhere between childhood 
and maturity. 

The curious and filmy character of 
Mr. Lafcadio Hearn's new book 
called " Kotto " (Macmillan) ac- 
cords well with its more descriptive sub -title, 
" Japanese Curios and Cobwebs," and with the ap- 
propriate and artistic illustrations by Genjiro Eto. 
The first nine tales, " only curios," are selections 
from several old Japanese books, " to illustrate 
some strange beliefs," the chief of which seems to 
be transmigration of souls. A very interesting chap- 
ter is the one entitled " A Woman's Diary," which 
might be called the Japanese version of " The Con- 
fessions of a Wife." Several of the "Cobwebs " are 
very dry and dusty ; indeed, the book as a whole 
is hardly up to the author's standard, — or possibly 
we miss the freshness and novelty of our first im- 
pressions of this charming writer. One of the most 
interesting portions of the book is that devoted to 
" Fireflies." It is wrought out from a Japanese 
work by Prof. S. Watase, formerly of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago and Wood's HoU, and now of 
the Imperial University at Tokyo. The Japanese 
original discusses the subject from a scientific as 
well as a popular point of view ; but Mr. Hearn 
confines himself to the latter, with numerous illus- 
trations from Japanese folk-lore and poetic litera- 
ture. In olden days, poverty-stricken students in 
China and Japan used to be compelled to learn 
their lessons by the fitful flame of fifty fireflies im- 
prisoned in a small bamboo cage. Even now, "many 
persons in Japan earn their living during the sum- 
mer months by catching and selling fireflies ; indeed, 
the extent of this business entitles it to be regarded 
as a special industry." The most famous place at

present for fireflies is in the neighborhood of Uji, 
fatnons also for iu tea. Here every summer crowds 
gather, even special trains bringing thousands of 
■visitors, to see the fireflies ; and on the river, at a 
point several miles from town, may be witnessed a 
" Firefly Battle," to see which people wait all night 

in boats. 

The Chief Executive of the nation 
■Omrgrma^ has declared that the preservation of 
""'***^''"' our forests and the conservation of 
our water-supplies constitute the most serious inter- 
nal problems confronting our country. Readers of 
Professor Fernow's '• Economics of Forestry," a 
recent volume in the " Library of Economics and 
Politics " (Crowell), will appreciate the seriousness 
of the problems which is hastening upon us with the 
destruction of our most valuable forests by the axe 
and fire, and consequent permanent deforestation 
of considerable areas. The large consumption, the 
wasteful methods, and the general lack of effort on 
the part of the lumbering interests to conserve the 
supply or to provide for the replacement of the for- 
ests, not only threaten us with a wood-famine, but 
they have already brought to light, even in Wiscon- 
sin, the possibilities of a desert arising where in the 
memory of man the forest once throve. The book is 
replete with facts that show, on the other hand, the 
possibilities of scientific treatment of the problem in 
the conservation and maintenance of existing sup- 
plies, the economic utilization of the product, and 
the reforestation with valuable timber of areas now 
abandoned to the chances of nature. The book 
ought to be. in the hands of every legislator in the 
land, and public-spirited men who wish to inform 
themselves authoritatively on the gravity of the 
problem and the needs and possibilities of pertinent 
legislation will find here the trustworthy informa- 
tion needed, as well as inspiration for formulating 
a public policy. The author styles it a reference- 
book for students of political economy, and profes- 
sional and lay students of forestry. It is all this, 
and more. It is a most cogent argument for an 
efficient grappling with the situation by scientific 
methods that shall save for the nation the remnant 
of its magnificent endowment of forests. The work 
has been begun ; the time is opportune for its ad- 
vancement by state and national legislation, and by 
corporate or individual utilization of the facilities 
now offered by the Bureau of Forestry at Wash- 
ington for scientific direction in the managment of 
woodlands. 

The Rev. W. K Bowen has partly 
Liftofanoud written and partly compiled a tribute 

to the memory of his uncle, Edward 
Bowen, who for forty-two years, as assistant master 
at Harrow, rendered most valuable service to the 
cause of secondary education. Without wife or chil- 
dren, he paid to the school a devotion that brooked 
no rival claims; and the success and honor that 
came to him in his chosen career were his sufficient 
reward. The details of his original methods in the 



classroom, where he is described by one of his pu- 
pils as an " enchanter," and the delineation of those 
characteristics that give him such a hold on boys in 
their play as well as in their work, furnish' most in- 
teresting reading. " Boys ought hardly ever to be 
punished against their will," was his golden rule of 
discipline; and his practice was to get the offender 
to name his own punishment. Yet he was a strict 
and remarkably successful disciplinarian. The old 
method of language-teaching by grammar he un- 
ceremoniously threw out of the window. He was 
in favor of "cribs," in the interest of more rapid 
progress and also of honesty and fairness. " Bohn 
is too much for us," he declared; and yet when he 
failed to persuade his colleagues to countenance 
translations, he achieved a wonderful degree of suc- 
cess in banishing and keeping out the intrusive Bohn. 
To his love of and proficiency in athletics he owed 
much of his singular influence over boys. He also 
wrote their school songs for them, in a rollicking 
vein that is irresistible. Many of these songs, 
and other poems from his pen, as well as some of 
his educational essays, are given in an appendix. 
(Longmans.) 

With the fourth volume of his His- 

t^At^^Mm. ***'7 °^ ^°"^ Carolina, the Presi- 
dent of the Historical Society of 
that State has concluded a noble work (McCrady's 
"South Carolina in the Revolution," Macmillan). 
This fourth volume covers the period 1780-1783. 
The same painstaking research that has produced 
the former volumes is evident here also. It is a 
very exact presentation of the military history of 
the period. When this has been said, the limitations 
of the work are indicated. The civil history of the 
State is almost ignored. The movement of public 
opinion as to the merits of the Revolutionary War, 
either in the State at large or as indicated in gov- 
erning circles, is left to one side, — and this in a 
State where the conflict of opinion was of eritieal 
importance. The persistent attempt throughout the 
volume to disparage General Greene, both as a sol- 
dier and as a man, is also a blemish on its pag^. 
There is no doubt that General Sumter and other 
State leaders have not hitherto been given due 
credit ; but it is not necessary to accumulate ob- 
loquy upon Gteneral Greene's head to accomplish 
that end. OnUide of these features, the work is 
critical and inclusive, and may stand as a master- 
piece of research for other State historians.

The number of sportsmen who seek 
trophies in the fields and woods with 
the camera is rapidly increasing. 
One of the most successful of them has given to the 
public a full account of his methods, and evidences 
of his good luck — or. rather, his skill; for with 
the camera, even more than with the gun, patience, 
coolness, good judgment, and above all persistency, 
are necessary in every successful stalk. Mr. A. 
Radclyffe Dugmore, in his '' Nature and the

THE DIAL 



[March 1» 



Camera " (Doubleday), has confided to his readers 
the details of his procedure in photographing live 
birds and their nests ; animals, wild and tame ; 
reptiles, insects, fish and other aquatic forms ; and 
flowers, trees, and fungi. The suggestions as to the 
outfit necessary for each subject are explicit, and 
the methods of overcoming difficulties which one 
meets in the field, in approaching the wary wild 
folk with the camera, are illustrated from the 
author's sxperience. The book is richly illustrated 
with very artistic and instructive pictures selected 
from the author's collection of over three thousand 
negatives. How much better this sounds than three 
thousand bird-skins ! The book is eminently prac- 
tical, and the hints and helps for the amateur, with 
which it abounds, together with the inspiration which 
the results presented by the author afford, should 
do much to advance this fascinating sport among 
nature-lovers. The work cannot fail to promote 
interest in the wild life of our fields and forests, 
and in time, let us hope, may lead to some cessation 
of the senseless and wanton killing of our native 
birds and beasts. There is in it also much promise 
for the development and enrichment of our decora- 
tive arts, as not a few of Mr. Dugmore's pictures 

bear witness. 

A guide to tho ^iss Julia Ellen Rogers, author of 
ttudyofour "Among Green Trees" (Chicago: 

common tree,. ^ ^ Mumford), does not think 
that a popular book about trees should describe all 
those that grow, say in North-Eastern America, 
and then expect the bewildered beginner to be able 
to tell them apart ; and because she knows of no 
" all-around tree-book " she has written the present 
one. It is in four parts, only one of which, called 
" Outdoor Studies with Trees," bears directly upon 
the matter of identification. This deals with such 
facts as one may learn, if he is interested and ob- 
servant, from the trees themselves, without any 
reference to books. Part II. discusses " The Life 
of Trees," that is, the physiological side of the 
study ; Part III., the practical matter of tree cul- 
ture ; and finally Part IV. describes " The Kinds of 
Trees," limited to the common species that grow in 
the United States, north of Virginia and east of 
the Rockies. There are about twenty-five full-page 
illustrations, picturing complete and beautiful speci- 
mens of our native trees. Countless detailed draw- 
ings and photographs supplementary to these very 
beautiful larger ones, furnish accurate data about 
bark, buds, leaves, flowers, fruit, seeds, etc. Ama- 
teurs interested in forestry will find Miss Rogers's 
book an excellent guide. 

Mr. Charles Gordon's elaborately 
illustrated work on "The Old Bai- 
ley and Newgate " (Pott) furnishes 
rather grim and ghastly entertainment. Stow, Fox, 
Holinshed, Howell, the letter-books of the Corpo- 
ration of the City of London, and many obscurer 
sources of information, have been ransacked with 
fruitful results, while old prints have been gener-

ously drawn upon to contribute whatever elements 
of a blood-curdling, hair-raising nature may be 
lacking in the text. But we must not convey a false 
impression. The book, though devoted largely to 
the careers of noted criminals and the penal horrors 
visited upon them, contains much curious informa- 
tion of a less forbidding nature ; and many of the 
illustrations are of historical interest and wholly free 
from repulsive features. Appropriate mention, too, 
is made of the labors of John Howard, Elizabeth 
Frye, and other prison-reformers. It would have 
been well if the author had made clear at the 
outset what is meant by "the Old Bailey." After 
stating that it takes its name from the hallium, or 
old wall running between Ludgate and Newgate, 
he passes on to the history of Newgate prison. Old 
Bailey is the name given both to the street occu- 
pying the site of the ancient wall, and also to the 
criminal court fronting on that street and adjoining 
the prison. But the old prison is now no more, its 
demolition having begun on the 15th of last August. 

It would be an interesting thing to 

"ulr fr'Tperr, '^'""^ ~ '^ °°^ ''""''^ '""*"' ^'^^^ 

place John Brown will have in Amer- 
ican history a hundred years from now. Perhaps 
an equally curious thing to know would be John 
Brown's place now, had not certain forces North and 
South conspired to make a martyr of him in 1859. 
Opinions will doubtless continue for some time to 
differ as to Brown's merits and his place in history. 
The savage attack made upon him by Professor 
Burgess in his recently published book on " The Civil 
War and the Constitution " will justify those who 
think very differently in writing sympathetic ac- 
counts of his life. Such a work is Mr. John Newton's 
" Captain John Brown of Harper's Ferry" ( Wessels), 
a book of three hundred pages, which gives the im- 
pressions of an ardent admirer, but does not furnish 
any new material. It simply tells again of the con- 
ditions which made John Brown possible, of the 
ideas which dominated him, and of the attempts he 
made to translate these ideas into accomplished facts. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Matthew Arnold's Notebooks" (Maemillan), edited 
by his daughter the Hon. Mrs. Wodehouse, offer us an 
interesting and intimate revelation of Arnold's intel- 
lectual habits. For nearly forty years, he kept diaries 
for his official engagements, and in these diaries he 
entered, from day to day, passages in his reading that 
particularly impressed him. The passages are brief, 
and include texts in Greek, Latin, French, German, 
Italian, and English. Many of them are of a religious 
character, and nearly all bear in some way on the con- 
duct of life. Mrs. Wodehouse has reprinted this matter 
verbatim for every fifth year of the note books. The 
result is so interesting that we could wish they had 
been reprinted entire. The sources are sometimes in- 
dicated, but in a majority of the cases we are left in 
the dark concerning the origin of the quoted passage.

NOTKS. 



" Studies in Zoology," by Mr. James A. Merrill, is 
" an introdaction to the stady of animalB for secondary 
schools and academies " jost pablished by the American 
Book Co. 

A collection of " posy-ring " mottoes, those charming 
bits of doggerel which exercised the wits of old-time 
lovers, has been made by Mr. Arthar L. Hnmphreys 
and issued in an exquisite little Tolume imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner. 

" San Francisco and Thereabout," by Mr. Charles 
Keeler, is a handsomely printed and illustrated guide- 
book published by the California Promotion Committee 
of San Francisco. It is " simple and direct, giving a brief 
history of the city's romantic past and a just description 
of its present life, with the pictoresque setting of bay 
and hills." 

"A Selection from Mrs. Browning's Poems," edited 
by Miss Heloise E. Hersey, and "John Woolman's 
Joomal " are two recent additions to the " Pocket 
Classics " of the Macmillan Co. For the latter of the 
two we are particularly grateful, because it makes ac- 
cessible an early American classic that deserves to be 
widely known. 

" Essentials in Ancient History," by Mr. Arthar 
Mayer Wolfson, is the first of a series of four volumes 
intended to cover the course recommended by the 
Committee of Seven for secondary schools. Professor 
Albert B. Hart is the general editor of the series, and 
will himself write the volume on American history. 
These books are published by the American Book Co. 

Volume II. of "The Athenian Drama," published 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., is devoted to 
Sophocles, the editor and translator being Professor 
John Swinnerton Phillimore. The plays included are 
the two CEdipns tragedies and the "Antigone." The 
illustrations are carefully chosen from famoos vases 
and works of sculpture, and there is an elaborate intro- 
daction. 

By the recent amalgamation of the English firms of 
Thomas Nelson & Sons and E. & J. B. Young & Co. 
the two largest and oldest Bible pablishing concerns 
doing business in this country and Great Britain have 
been consolidated. The New York branches of the two 
firms have been absorbed by an American corporation 
organized under the state laws of Xew York, with the 
corporate title of Thomas Nelson & Sons. 

A thin volume on Robert Lonis Stevenson, pub- 
lished by Messrs. James Pott & Co., belongs to what 
are called " The Bookman Biographies." The text is 
very scanty, but this deficiency is made up by the pict- 
ures, of which there are some two score. This is the first 
volume of the series, and similar volumes on Carlyle, 
Dickens, and Count Tolstoy are promised for early pub- 
lication. 

Under the title of " The Chiswick Library of Noble 
Writers," the Scott- Thaw Co., a publishing firm re- 
cently organized in New York City, is about to issue a 
series of finely printed books in folio. The aim of the 
publishers is to produce a series of volumes which shall 
present noble books in noble form, avoiding the accusa- 
tion of archaism on the one hand and eccentricity on 
the other. The series will be printed at the Chiswick 
Press on handmade paper specially made by Messrs. 
Arnold & Foster, and the intention is to make books 
which shall be read, and not merely treasured as curi- 



osities. The first two volumes will be Landor's " Peri- 
cles and Aspasia " and More's " L'topia," and in each 
case the edition for sale in this country is limited to 
200 copies. 

Mr. J. N. Lamed has written " A Primer of Bight 
and Wrong" (Houghton) for the use of young people 
in school and at home. His style is simple and be does 
not preach overmuch, which gives his little book a fair 
chance of reaching some portion of the audience for 
which it is intended. Mr. Lamed illustrates his own 
moralizings by an interesting selection of " examples 
and opinions " quoted from standard sources. 

Two little volumes of extracts from the writings of 
Benjamin Jowett have been edited by Professor Lewis 
Campbell, and are published by Mr. Henry Frowde. 
One of them contains passages from the introductions 
to the Platonic dialogues, the other illustrates the 
theological writings of the master. The volumes are 
pocketable, and should make Jowett mean something 
to readers for whom be is now little more than a name. 

" The Boy's Iliad," by Mr. Walter Copland Perry, 
is a boys' story-book published by the Macmillan Co. 
It is attractively printed, and charmingly illustrated by 
Mr. Jacomb Hood. The contents extend beyond the 
" Iliad " te the whole cycle of Trojan legend, and in- 
clude such matters as the judgment of Paris, the sac- 
rifice of Iphigenia, the campaigns of Penthesileia, the 
death of Achilles, the wooden horse, the fate of Laocoon, 
and the sack of Troy. The text is simple but dignified, 
using the actual words of Greek poetry as far as pos- 
sible, and the book as a whole is deserving of the warm- 
est commendation. 

The " American Commonwealths Series " is being 
rapidly pushed toward completion by the publishers, 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Nine volumes are in 
preparation, and the first to appear will be " Texas " by 
Prof. George P. Garrison of the University o* Texas. 
Mr. Frank G. Sanborn of Concord is writing the history 
of his native state, New Hampshire ; and the other seven 
volumes will be : " Wisconsin," by Mr. Reuben G. 
Thwaites; " New Jersey," by Mr. Austin Scott; " Penn- 
sylvania," by Mr. Talcott Williams; " Louisiana," by 
Mr. Albert Phelps; " Illinois," by Prof. John H. Finley; 
" Minnesota," bv Dr. William F. Folwell; and « Iowa," 
by Dr. Albert Shaw. 

The Spring list of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 
will include " The Ward of King Canute," a new novel 
by Miss Otillie A. Liljencrantz, author of " The Thrall 
of Leif the Lucky "; " The Souls of BUck Folk." a vol- 
ume of essays on the negro question by Prof. W. E. B. 
DuBois ; " A Selection from the Best English Essays," 
edited bv Mr. Sherwin Cody ; a translation by Miss 
Mary J.' SafEord of Felix Dahn's "Felicitas"; "The 
Reflections of a Lonely Man," by "A. C. M."; a col- 
lection of " Cartoons by McCutcbeon," one of the best 
known newspaper artists of the day ; " The Law of 
Mental Medicine," by Mr. Thomson J. Hudson ; and 
an "Index to Poetry and Recitations," edited by Miss 
Edith Granger. 

" Every Day in the Year " (Dodd), compiled by Mr. 
James L. Ford and Mrs. Mary K. Ford, is a poetical 
anthology upon a new plan. Every day in the year is 
illustrated by a poem, or group of poems, commemora- 
tive of some important occurrence. All sorts of things 
are celebrated, from birthdays to battles, and the poems 
are of a high average order of merit, although in the 
nature of things some days have given cause for much

more iDBpiring verse than others, and in a few instances 
the editors evidently found it difficult to find anything 
to celebrate. Taking an illustration at random, we find 
for the date of April 19, poems on the death of Bea- 
consfield, the attack on the Union troops in Baltimore 
in 1861, Emerson's " Concord Hymn," a ballad on 
<* The Minute Men of Northboro'," a sonnet on the 
death of Byron, Realf's " Apocalypse," and two pieces 
on the declaration of Cuban Independence by the United 
States Congress.

THE DIAL begs to call the attention of the Book Trade to its 
Annual SPRING ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER, 
to be issued March i6. This issue will contain the usual compre- 
hensive and carefully classified " List of Books Announced for Spring 
Publication " by the American Publishing Trade. The value of this 
number as an aid in planning purchases of Spring books (for which 
purpose it is used very generally by librarians, the reuil trade, and 
private buyers), and its consequent exceptional desirability as a 
medium for publishers' advertising, have long been established. 

Orders for advertising space in this special 
issue, with copy, should be forwarded at once.

The REFLEiCTIONS 
OF A 

Lonely Man 

By "A. C. M." 

When the reader has finished this little book, 
he will not be able to understand why so 
clever and observing a philosopher conceals 
his identitv behind the ambiguous initial. He 
will doubtless want to know more of this 
" Lonely Man " whose strong personality is 
apparent in his writing, for his reflections deal 
with matters of every-day discussion in a 
manner that is fresh, vigorous, and original. 
The author prefers to maintain his seclusion, 
however, and it is doubtful whether his ident-

Dr. Hudson, after a considerable period of re-

work since " The Law of Psvchic Phe- 
nomena," a volume which has reached a sale 
of nearly 60,000 copies, and which competes 
ver}' actively with popular fiction at many 
public libraries. In his new volume his theo- 
ries are even more bold and original, being 
frequently at decided variance with most of 
the published authorities on this and similar 
subjects. As the topic is one that is exciting 
much wide-spread discussion, the sales will 
probably be larger than those of any of his

The Triumph of Life 

By WILLIAM FARQUHAR PAYSON, Author of "John VytaV 
A story essentially of modern life. It tells of the struggles of a young writer, Enoch 
Lloyd, with what seems to be financial success at the price of moral failure. There 
are two women in the case, the two opposing influences. One is Celeste Moreau, 
the worldly, mocking daughter of a French hotel-keeper ; the other is Marion Lee, 
daughter of Lloyd's publisher. His struggle between these two influences — the one 
demoralizing, the other ennobling — is worked out through many intricacies of plot, 
and only after a series of intense dramatic situations, such as are found in stories of 
vivid strength, does he emerge triumphant from the final crisis.

His life is full of activity of the best

SHAKSPERE 

AND HIS FORERUNNERS 

Studies in Eli:{abethan Poetry and 
its Development from Early English 

By SIDNEY LANIER 



^yr HE author's aim here is to present 
\l} Shakspere as the crowning glory 
and culmination of the most marvel- 
ous literary efflorescence the world 
has known. In order to do this adequately 
he gives first a most suggestive survey of 
the beginnings of English poetry ; and 
then, after an elaborate treatment of the 
sonnet writers from Surrey to Shakspere, 
he takes up in detail the study of the man, 
William Shakspere, the social life which 
surrounded him, and his mental and spirit- 
ual evolution as shown by the growth of 
his art. From the existing evidence, and 
the " relation of man to his fellow man " 
in the various plays, Mr. Lanier constructs 
a probable sequence and grouping of the 
great master's work which bears largely 
upon its face the story of the man's own life 
struggle and mighty conquest of himself. 
Much of the best prose work Mr. Lanier 
left is contained in these two volumes.

NOTES 214 



THE AUTHOR OF ''JOHN INGLES ANT." 

The name of the late Mr. Shorthouse ap- 
pears upon the title-pages of half a dozen 
books, but nine persons out of ten to whom 
his name means anything at all know him only 
as the author of "John Inglesant."' The very 
titles of the later and slighter books have faded 
from the memory, but the solitary masterpiece 
given to the world by an absolutely unknown 
writer twenty-two years ago remains in the re- 



collection of those who have read it, not as a 
name only, but as a collection of pictures and 
vivid impressions of the sort that become a 
permanent possession. There are many among 
those readers, no doubt, who have forgotten- 
the author's name, there may be those who have 
forgotten the name of his titular hero ; but even 
these can hardly have forgotten the account of 
the papal conclave and the plague at Naples, 
the Molinist philosophy of quietism, the sym- 
pathetic study of the English Cavalier, and the 
intimate revelation of life in seventeenth cen- 
tury Italy. We may have read many other 
works of fiction since, and the outline of " John ■ 
Inglesant " may have grown dim in the retro- 
spect, but its brilliancy and its spiritual con- 
tent remain with us, and we never grow doubt- 
ful of its right to be held a part of English lit- 
erature. 

"Joseph Henry Shorthouse, manufacturer 
of sulphuric acid, etc., Birmingham." This, 
with a list of titles, and a statement that his- 
favorite recreation is found in " books," ig 
the information provided by " Who's Who.'*^ 
Neither the name nor the place nor the ooca- 
pation is particularly suggestive of literature. 
So we might read in some similar handbook of 
Nathaniel Hawthorne that he was a gauger at 
the Boston custom house, surveyor of the 
port of Salem, and United States consul atr 
Liverpool. These things do not seem to agree 
with " The Scarlet Letter " any more than 
Birmingham and sulphuric acid seem to agree 
with "John Inglesant." The moral appears 
to be that the free spirit of man will find self- 
expression under no matter how adverse an en- 
vironment. We have brought Hawthorne into 
this discussion with deliberate intention, for 
Shorthouse recognized him as the supreme 
master in the species of composition to which 
" John Inglesant " belongs — " the philosoph- 
ical romance." His tribute is paid in the fol- 
lowing words : " There will at once occur to the 
reader's mind numerous works of fiction of the 
highest talent, where philosophical ideas have 
been introduced with surpassing effect. By 
Nathaniel Hawthorne this art was carried to 
such perfection that it is only with difficulty 
that we perceive how absolutely every character^ 



188 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



nay, every word and line, is subordinated to the 
philosophical idea of the book." 

When "John Inglesant" came to a second 
edition, the author took occasion to prepare a 
prefatory statement of his aim in writing it. 
Philosophy in the guise of fiction was what of 
deliberate purpose he offered his readers, and 
this called for a method of treatment quite dif- 
ferent from that employed by novelists of the 
ordinary sort. " In books where fiction is only 
used to introduce philosophy, I believe that it 
is not to be expected that human life is to be 
described simply as such. The characters are, 
so to speak, sublimated : they are only intro- 
duced for a set purpose, and having fulfilled 
this purpose, — were it only to speak a dozen 
■words — they vanish from the stage. Nor is 
this so unlike real life as may at first appear. 
Human life, as revealed to most of us, does not 
group itself in stage effect, does not arrange 
itself in elaborate plot ; and brilliant dialogue 
declares the glory of the author more fre- 
quently than it increases reality of effect. If 
fiction, therefore, is allowed to select and to 
condense from life, surely philosophy may do 
so too." Concerning this declaration of guiding 
principle we are constrained to say that the au- 
thor did not altogether live up to it, for " John 
Inglesant " is far from being the abstract pro- 
duction that he would have us believe. It has 
no small degree of warmth, and color, and 
dramatic effectiveness, and just because it is 
possessed of these qualities it is a better book 
than it would have been had Mr. Shortbouse 
held fast to the logic of his doctrinaire phi- 
losophy of fiction. 

"John Inglesant" is a historical novel in 
the sense that it introduces the figures of men 
who have played real parts in history, and that 
its scene is set in a definite historical period. 
But it is very unlike the novel that is ordinarily 
styled historical, because it penetrates so much 
farther beneath the surface of life. The fault 
of the common historical novel is, as Mr. Short- 
house suggests, that the romance outweighs the 
history ; and it is a further fault that what his- 
tory is vouchsafed us concerns only the trap- 
pings and the suits of the period, leaving its 
spirit nnrevealed. " All that is wanted," he 
tells us, " to constitute a historical romance of 
the highest interest is the recovery of the de- 
tailed incidents of everyday life, and the awaken- 
ing of the individual need and striving, long 
since quiet in the grave." This is the sort of 
historical romance that we find in " John In- 
glesant," a story of the spiritual life essentially, 



a story that we instinctively classify, because 
we find it in some way comparable, with such 
diverse masterpieces as " IPromessi Sposi," and 
" Wilhelm Meister," and " La Chartreuse de 
Parme," and " The Cloister and the Hearth." 
To name a more recent analogue, we might 
mention Mrs. Wharton's " The Valley of De- 
cision." We do not read these books, nor do 
we read " John Inglesant," primarily for the 
story that is told ; we read them rather because 
they interpret for us the modes of thought and 
the spiritual currents of other times and places. 
They are studies in the history of culture rather 
than pleasant imaginings about private in- 
dividuals. 

It is such books as these that redeem fiction 
from the reproach of catering to the mere enter- 
tainment of the reader, and that justify it as 
the typical form of modern literary art. Fiction 
has much to answer for, no doubt, in the way 
of sensationalism, and pettiness, and morbid 
imagination, and false idealism. But a book 
like " John Inglesant " shows that the writing 
of novels may be also one of the noblest forms 
of artistic and ethical endeavor. And the high 
mission of the serious novelist has not often 
found as fine an exemplification as in this very 
book, or as beautiful a statement as in this 
reply of the author to the sneer implied in the 
words : " It is only a romance." " True. It is 
only human life in the ' highways and hedges,' 
and in ' the streets and lanes of the city,' with 
the ceaseless throbbing of its quivering heart ; 
it is only daily life from the workshop, from 
the court, from the market, and from the stage ; 
it is only kindliness and neighborhood and 
child-life, and the fresh wind of heaven, and 
the waste of sea and forest, and the sunbreak 
upon the starless peaks, and contempt of wrong 
and pain and death, and the passionate yearn- 
ing for the face of God, and woman's tears, 
and woman's self-sacrifice and devotion, and 
woman's love. Yes, it is only a romance. It 
is only the ivory gates falling back at the fairy 
touch. It is only the leaden sky breaking for 
a moment above the bowed and weary head, 
revealing the fathomless Infinite through the 
gloom. It is only a romance." 

Those who have come under the spell of this 
masterpiece of philosophical and historical fic- 
tion will doubtless wish to know the other work 
of Mr. Shorthouse. There are five volumes of 
these minor writings. "The Little Schoolmaster 
Mark," " Sir Percival," " Countess Eve," " A 
Teacher of the Violin, and Other Tales," and 
" Blanche, Lady Falaise." The note of spir-

itnality is dominant in them all, and tends to 
become so refined as to escape from ordinary 
human limitations. This is particularly true 
in the case of " Sir Percival," which teaches 
how, even under the conditions of modern life, 
the quest of the Grail may still be pursued. 
But these books are trifles in comparison with 
" John Inglesant." Of that masterpiece we are 
glad to note the stately three-volume edition 
which has just been published, and which gives 
a worthy setting to its contents. It remains to 
be said that Mr. Shorthonse was born in 1834, 
and was thus in his sixty-ninth year at the time 
of his death. 



OUTLINE OF LINCOLN LITERATURE. 



The recent appear&uce of Nicolay's "Short Life 
of Abraham Lincoln." — the more purely biog- 
raphical portion of ^icolay and Hay's great work, 
"Abraham Lincoln, a History." — fitly completes, 
to date, the tale of immense Lineolniana already 
in print, and suggests an inquiry into the rise and 
progress of this remarkable literature. For its very 
beginnings we need to go back only a little more 
than forty years. 

In an oration delivered before the Society of the 
Army of the Potomac, in October, 1899, by Major 
Lambert of Philadelphia, and subsequently printed, 
the following interesting bit of Lincoln chronology 
is established : '■ In a book published in New York 
in 1859. entitled ■ Presidential Candidates,' contain- 
ing sketches of prominent candidates for the Pres- 
idency in 1860, sketches are given of twenty-one 
distinguished men ; in another, entitled * Oar Living 
Representative Men,' published in Philadelphia in 
1860. thirty-four memoirs are given ; in neither of 
these books is Abraham Lincoln named, except in- 
cidentally in one of the sketches of Douglas, where 
allusion is made to the defeat of the former." 

Of these fifty-five formerly distinguished names, 
by far the larger number lie impacted in dictionaries 
which record a brief digest of their respective pub- 
lic careers ; while the obscure individual so casually 
mentioned in connection with the great men of his 
day, and who before long was to do things un- 
dreamed of, comes to figure, some forty years later, 
as the subject of one of the fullest personal biblio- 
g^phies known. 

The earliest collection of Lineolniana is probably 
that of Mr. William V. Spencer, who published at 
Boston, in 1865. a quarto volume of some 350 pages 
of sermons, eulogies, letters, and publications on 
Mr. Lincoln's death. Following this, the next year, 
came the work of the Rhode Island scholar and 
bibliographer, John Russell Bartlett, with his " Lit- 
erature of the Rebellion : a Catalogue of Books and 
Pamphlets Relating to the Civil War in the U. &, 



and on Subjects Growing out of that Event, To- 
gether with Works on American Slavery, and Essays 
and Reviews from Magazines on the same Subject." 
In this collection there are 81 title-entries relating to 
Lincoln, comprising a few of his own speeches, mes- 
sages, and debates ; a meagre record of his public 
life and policy ; those of the early biographies which 
had come to the compiler's notice ; a group of pro- 
ceedings of cities, towns, and public bodies, on the 
occasion of his death ; and lately, in a separate liat, 
a catalogue of 300 commemorative eulogies, ser- 
mons, orations, and poems. 

The next in point of time is the " Memorial 
Lincoln Bibliography" issued by Andrew Boyd, at 
Albany, New York, in 1870. This work is in two 
diatinet parts. The second part is merely a cata- 
logue of a collection owned by the publisher, consist- 
ing of prints, medals, handbills, commemorative 
miscellany of all sorts, such as decorative badges 
for special occasions, and the like, — matter of no 
especial literary interest The first part is the real 
Bxbliographia, Lineolniana, being a somewhat an- 
notated bibliography of the literature of the collec- 
tion, — eulogies, orations, etc.. set forth with fitting 
introduction by the compiler, Mr. Charles Henry 
Hart. In Joseph Sabin's monumental " Dictionary 
of Books Relating to America,'' Volume X., which 
contains several pa^es of references to works about 
Lincoln, the title " Bibliographia Lineolniana," with 
notes and introduction by C. H. Hart, has the follow- 
ing naive comment appended thereto : " Includes 
most of the titles contained in Andrew Boyd's 
work on the same subject." The latter has the 
simple entry, '> A Memorial Lincoln Bibliography 
by Andrew Boyd," with nothing to indicate Mr. 
Hart's collaboration ; and when the latter's reprint 
of his catalogue was published, the mere juxta- 
position of titles in the Sabin catalogue did not dis- 
close their real relationship. 

This early work of Mr. Hart's, prepared with 
such care and fulness in gathering material which 
might otherwise never have been recovered, has 
contributed to the increased value of the next most 
comprehensive publication of its kind, " Lincoln 
Literature, a Bibliographical Account of Books and 
Pamphlets Relating to Abraham Lincoln, Compiled 
by Daniel Fish, Member and Secretary Public Li- 
brary Board, Minneapolis, Minn.; Published by the 
Board, 1900." This is an unbound book of 135 
pages, royal octavo, in an attractive paper cover, and 
contains over 800 full titles, occasionally annotated, 
of books and pamphlets which have ever appeared 
as distinct issues. An interesting variety of foreign 
titles appear: In French, 14 ; nearly twice as many 
in German : a few each of Italian and Spanish ; one 
Welsh, one Japanese, one Russian, and a translation 
of a popular life into modern Greek. Limiting the 
effort to separate publications excludes, of course, 
some of the most valuable material, as many of the 
best tributes to Lincoln lie embedded in an author's 
'* Complete Works "; magazine articles also indexed 
in " Poole" are not referred to. But these excln-

sions do not rob this work of its chief distinction, 
which lies in the volume and variety of writings about 
a man unknown to fame six years before his death, 
and who was never known in public life aside from 
one great question. What manner of man was this 
to evoke a literature so copious, so universal, and 
finally so unanimous ? For one of the obvious char- 
acteristics of the collection is the meagre record left 
upon its pages of the violently hostile criticism be- 
longing to the early sixties. Volumes of it can be 
found, it is true, in the files of the war-time news- 
papers. But of the bitterly arrogant opinion upon 
the conduct of the war, with which the atmosphere 
was charged even at the capital city itself, few traces 
remain. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe has preserved for 
as the flavor of much of the usual speech of the day 
in her book of reminiscences. Writing of the com- 
mon estimate of Lincoln in the autumn of '61, she 
says: 

" Fev people praised or trnsted him. Why did he not do 
this, or that, or the other ? He a President, indeed I Look 
at this war, dra^rging on so slowly ! Look at our many de- 
feats and rare victories ! Such was the talk that one con- 
stantly heard regarding him. The most charitable held that 
he meant well." 

But to return to the obscurity of 1859, — consid- 
erably less an obscurity in Illinois, however, than in 
the Eastern publishing centres. The leading events 
of Lincoln's life from '58 to '60 can be picked out 
and strung on a very small inch of string. These 
were, the defeat for the Senate in 1858 ; the sugges- 
tion for the Presidency by an Illinois editor in 1859 ; 
the three years of speech-making from 1 858 to 1860. 
Upon the untried occasion of the Cooper Institute 
speech, the dean of American letters, William Cul- 
len Bryant, well within the limits of a conservative 
truthfulness, introduced the speaker as " an eminent 
citizen of the West, hitherto known to yon only by 
reputation." 

With 1860, however, and the accepted fact of Lin- 
coln's candidacy for the office of President, a num- 
ber of impromptu biographies scrambled into print. 
Most of these were campaign documents, written 
chiefly by newspaper men of experience, and not 
without merit in their brief fidelity to fact. For 
Lincoln's public career had offered so little, aside 
from his one term of service in Congress and his 
speech-making on a single theme, that the original 
material was easily mastered, his simple record pre- 
senting none of the stumbling-blocks in the path of 
one whose task it is to write of a long and sometimes 
wavering political career. 

These early biographies were usually duodecimos 
in the ordinary newspaper print of that day. They 
bore upon their paper covers varying and utterly 
dissimilar likenesses of the candidate, in the form of 
dingy woodcuts. The engraver's effort to impose 
upon his subject all the air of distinction which the 
seasoned statesman is expected to carry is quite ap- 
parent. 

Of these early volumes, five appeared anonym- 
ously in 1860 ; a number probably belonging to the 
flame year have no imprint date ; and of the re- 



mainder, four are accredited respectively to J. H. 
Barrett, D. W. Bartlett, William D. Howells, and 
John Locke Scripps. Of these authors, Bartlett 
was Washington correspondent of the New York 
"Independent" and the "Evening Post," and was 
afterward known in a modest way as a writer of 
books which are still read. If J. H. Barrett achieved 
a subsequent fame, the anonymity of the double in- 
itial remains undisclosed. Mr. Howells's reputation 
has been gleaned in such different fields that few 
people, even among those counting themselves fa- 
miliar with the facts of his career, ever recall this 
early work which appeared in the same year with 
" Poems by Two Friends." The Scripps life was 
published anonymously as No. 6 of " Tribune 
Tracts," the campaign literature put forth by the 
New York " Tribune " in the days when Horace 
Greeley was an aggressive Lincoln man. The au- 
thor was at that time editor of the Chicago " Press 
and Tribune." At the date of publication, the 
pamphlet was sold at twenty dollars a thousand. 
It is now very scarce, a single copy having lately 
brought ten dollars. In 1900 this brochure was re- 
printed in a very attractive form by the Cranbrooke 
Press, Detroit, and claimed on its title-page to be the 
" first published life of Abraham Lincoln," a state- 
ment which obviously conflicts with the accepted 
belief that the anonymous " Wigwam edition " of 
Rudd & Carleton was the first. Since Judge Fish's 
Bibliography was issued, however, an overlooked 
biography by J. Q. Howard, published in Colum- 
bus by the Follett & Foster Company in 1860, has 
come to light, and may on close investigation prove 
to be the first. The preface of the latter is dated 
June, 1860. Thus began, in this comparatively light- 
hearted and irresponsible fashion, a series of writ- 
ings upon a theme soon to expand into immeasurable 
dignity and importance. 

In the following four years, during which history 
was made by the sword and not by the pen, natu- 
rally the printed records of the time are concen- 
trated upon military and diplomatic questions for 
the full understanding of which recourse must be 
had to the literature of the Rebellion. But in this 
more purely personal literature little appears be- 
yond a few isolated monographs, occasionally object- 
ing to the war measures, and sometimes enjoining 
the duty of loyal support of the President's course. 
But with April, 1865, the biographical treatment 
begins in earnest. It would be interesting indeed 
to have a composite analysis of the volumes of 
sermons preached upon that memorable Easter 
Sunday, and upon subsequent fast days. What a 
tribute of mourning there was I And how the eyes 
of the people were opened, now that his mortal life 
had passed ! Those who had clamored for a leader 
who should sweep all before him with the majesty 
of the whirlwind and the fire, were now hearing for 
the first time the voice of a strong and an honest 
man, and were not ashamed to go aside and wrap 
their faces in the mantle of self-reproach.

So full a bibliog^phy as this is necessarily, in 
effect, and to a degree. stamj>ed with the manner of 
thought and habit of the people who make the record ; 
consequently a few of the aberrations of our national 
walk and conversation are revealed in its pages. 
Some of them are almost grotesque, others only odd 
or fanciful : all of them are characteristic of the 
feeble historic sense which uses the great facts of 
history merely as serviceable wires upon which flut- 
tering fads of doctrine or experience alight sparrow- 
like and are gone. For instance, on page 80 of the 
« Lincoln Literature " we have an entry setting forth 
the " Interior Causes of the War : the Nation De- 
monized, and its President a Spirit-rapper; by a 
Citizen of Ohio"; also, "Africanus I.; his Secret 
Life, as Revealed under the Mesmeric Influence." 
A publisher of phrenological mat«rial undertakes to 
explain the character and constitution of Lincoln 
and Grant in accordance with the principles of phre- 
nology ; and an anonymous prophet demonstrates 
that Abraham Lincoln was the *■ Gog of the Bible, as 
foretold by the prophet Ezekiel in the XXXVIII. 
and XXXIX. chapters of his Book of Prophecy ; 
the Thirteen Confederate States shown to be the 
mountains of Israel, and all the predictions con- 
tained in the Prophecy concerning them literally 
fulfilled in the late War between the North and 
South." This was no longer ago than 1868. 

One opportune humorist announces >■ Old Abe's 
jokes, fresh from Abraham's Bosom ; containing all 
his issues, excepting the Greenbacks, to call in some 
of which this work is issued." An inquiry into the 
"Religious Faith of those engaged in the Conspir- 
acy that Resulted in the Assassination of President 
Lincoln " is really a lecture on Romanism delivered 
to an audience probably already too much engrossed 
with an unprofitable prejudice. One Confederate 
temperance-tract makes the sorrowful admission: 
"Better had we bowed the neck to Lincoln's yoke 
than made ourselves the willing slaves of grovelling 
passions and depraved appetites ! " This suggests 
the description of Abraham Lincoln given to Greneral 
Meade's nephew, the Honorable John S. Wise, by 
his schoolmaster, who was perfectly sincere in in- 
fltancting bis pupil that the republican candidate was, 
"in his origin, of that class of low whites who hate 
gentlemen because they are gentlemen : how, in per- 
sonal appearance, he was more like a gorilla than a 
human being," and that he had gone '• far beyond 
other leaders in advocacy of radical measures 
against slavery, and in abuse of the Sauth." And, 



adds the well-bred Southern lad who lived to write 
"The End of an Era," "that seUled Abraham 
Lincoln with me." 

Only a very few copies of "Lincoln Literature" 
remain unsold. The work has already attained at 
book-«ales the distinction of a '* scarce first edition." 
Should a second edition be in contemplation, it might 
be prefaced most fittingly by such a critical and 
biographical sketch as the one with which Ford, 
for instance, introduces his "Franklin Biblio- 
graphy." 

"rhe approaching centennial of Lincoln's birth 
should present unusual oppK>rtnnitieB to the reading 
public for fresh and vigorous stady of Lincoln's life 
and work, together with a renewed interest in the 
Civil War and all that its results mean to us. 
Would not the anniversary year be most appro- 
priately welcomed, and its observance put to the 
most patriotic use, if all interested students could 
have at their disposal such a well-arranged guide to 
their readings as Justin Winsor's "' Readers' Hand- 
book of the American Revolution,'' which itself was 
a result of the centennial interest in American in- 
dependence? If the history of our country from 
1858 to 1865 could be set forth chronologically, after 
the manner of the Winsor " Handbook," with refer- 
ence to sources and to second-hand aathorities, and 
with full valuation of the biographies, so that 
readers would know what the Arnold, Holland, 
Lamon, Herndon, Morse, Nicolay and Hay, and 
Tarbell •' Lives " stand for, an exceedingly useful 
service would be rendered which should result in a 
great uplift of public intelligence. A second edition 
of the ■' Lincoln Literature " itself might be re- 
arranged and recast on lines which would include 
the bwt features of both the Ford " Franklin Bib- 
liography " and the Winsor " Handbook." A new 
edition, too. would include considerable material 
which has appeared since January, 1901. 

Many of Lincoln's contemporaries gave utter- 
ance to the fear that the Lincoln history would fade 
into a Lincoln myth. There is no danger of that 
kind of intellectual atavism. So long as we are free 
from such " battles of crows and kites " as afflict 
our South American neighbors, we may go about 
our various duties with a thankful and reverent 
cherishing of the Lincoln spirit in our national life.

THE EMERSON CENTENARY. 



It is so short a time since the death of Emerson, 
and the impression of him as a living force among 
us is still so vivid, that it is hard to realize that the 
centenary of his birth is close at hand. The date 
of this event is May 25 ; and it will be fitly cele- 
brated by Emerson societies and similar associations 
throughout the country. The most interesting of 
these events will doubtless be that at Emerson's

associated for the purpose. Special Sunday services, 
with sermons or addresses by eminent lovers of 
Emerson, will also be arranged both in Boston and

COMMUNICA TION. 



POE AND ARISTOTLE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial. ) 

In Mr. Moore's admirable and acute discussion of 
" Poe's Place as a Critic," published in The Dial of 
February 16, the writer dwells at considerable length 
on one of Poe's critical dicta, namely, that there can 
be no long poem in the nature of things. "The nature 
of things" is a loose phrase; he meant, probably, the 
natural powers of attention and memory. Mr. Moore 
objects that Poe has left us in doubt as to what meas- 
ure of length he would fix in strictly defining a poem. 
Poe was apt to be whimsical and vague in criticism, but 
sometimes he hit the nail on the head. I think he had 
already anticipated the impatience of modern readers 
of poetry, as well as of poets themselves. Perhaps he 
was also thinking of the time when poetry was recited ; 
which would naturally imply a time-limit. If he had 
said no long poems are now written and no one has time 
or mind to attend to them, he would have come near 
the truth. The longest poem has now the shortest life. 
And if read, it is for the purpose of finding and enjoy- 
ing its gems, its striking passages. These, if really 
great, are soon disengaged and re-set as specimens, and 
are gathered at last into anthologies. Poe therefore laid 
down a rule in accordance with popular taste, possibly 
to cover his own work, and to justify his never attempt- 
ing a poem of any length. 

It used to be urged upon poets who attained some 



fame in verse, that for the completion of their reputation, 
or for the honor of their country, their work should be 
crowned with one supreme effort, — if possible, an epic 
on a great theme. And poets themselves seem to have 
been impelled by the same desire for Aristotle's " cer- 
tain magnitude " in their works. Yet I cannot quite 
agree with Mr. Moore in his application of Aristotle's 
" magnitude " as referring to the length of a poem. Is 
not Mr. Moore here speaking of long poems in dis- 
tinction from short ones? Unless I mistake, he is. But 
in the place where Aristotle employs the expression 
" certain magnitude," chapter seven of the Poetics, he is 
not discussing length or quantity of poems. He is speak- 
ing only of tragedy ; and he means by magnitude simply 
a consistent action, perfect and whole, — or, as we 
might express it, a large, beautiful, and orderly arrange- 
ment and treatment of the theme, and only long enough 
to be easily remembered. Aristotle expressly says that 
length with reference to dramatic representation does 
not fall under the consideration of art. In short, as I 
understand Aristotle he is not referring to poetry ia 
general but to the construction of tragedies. ' 

Yet there can be no doubt that in the classic period 
of Greek literature long poems were held in higher es- 
timation than short ones. Lyrical and occasional verse 
had also its place of honor, — Pindar, Sappho, and many 
others, being as popular poets as Homer. In Aristotle's 
comment on magnitude it must be remembered that he 
refers solely to tragedies. As these were sometimes in 
the form of trilogies, he had to take into account mag- 
nitude, or length, and explain its propriety, — not as 
mere length but as duration of time in the action; yet 
to this he denies any part in artistic theory. 

1 would like to add to the list of great and authori- 
tative critics cited by Mr. Moore, Goethe, who has left 
a larger though scattered body of purely literary criti- 
cism than either Aristotle or Lessing. And he is at one 
with Poe, in both theory and practice, in regard to long 
poems, if we leave out, as we ought, his dramatic works. 
For by a long poem I apprehend we mean such as "The 
Faerie Queene," " Paradise Lost " and " Paradise Re- 
gained," "Roman de la Rose," "The Divine Comedy," 
and the works of Homer and Virgil. It is to be noticed 
in all long poems, that when closely analysed they consist 
largely of episodes, — as if the authors realized that the 
reader's attention and memory could not be relied on 
to carry him through without a break. All long poems 
with which I am acquainted may be resolved into short 
ones, and were so resolved in the more ancient times 
when recited ; and thus I think Poe was right in his phi- 
losophy in saying that in the nature of things — that 
is, iu the constitution of the poet and of the hearer or 
reader, and for the perfect effects of poetry, including 
the shock of delighted surprise and the fixing in the 
memory, — there can be no long poems. Of course, 
Poe never intended to include dramatic composition in 
his dictum. There is where length — or, in Aristotle's 
word, " magnitude," — has its appropriate place and 
rights; unless, as iu Lessing's story, the " characters die 
of the Fifth Act." 

Allow me to conclude with a line from a poet who 
was also a master critic, Horace ; and to translate it into 
the vernacular: 

" Verum operi longe fas est obrepere somnum." 

(If you must read your long poem, don't take offense 
if I go to sleep occasionally.)

Democracy and Political Paktiks.* 

Democratic institutions have had attention, 
to the neglect of the political forces from which 
they have derived their life. Men have so 
busied themselves in spreading the machinery 
•of democratic government over the world that 
they have not stopped to inquire whether de- 
mocracy and its machinery are one. Indeed, 
to many the test of democracy itself is the effi- 
ciency of the machinery of democratic govern- 
cnent. It was quite time to consider whether 
permanent political parties, having power as 
their end, with general contracts to solve all 
political problems as they arise, are essential 
to democratic government. Mr. M. Ostrogorski, 
a Russian who has long resided in Paris, in two 
large volumes entitled " Democracy and the 
Organization of Political Parties," sets forth 
with ffreat clearness the results of a most ex- 
haastive investigation of this question. 

Mr. James Bryce, in a preface to the book, 
notes that no one has produced a treatise 
" cootaining a gystematic examination and description 
of the structure of parties as organizations goremed 
bj settled rules and working h\ established methods. 
Even in the United States, where party organization 
■early attained a completeness and effective power un- 
approached in any other country, I could not find, when 
in 1883 I began to study and was seeking to portray the 
institutions of that country, any account of the very re- 
markable and well-compacted scheme of organization 
which had been at work there for forty or fifty years; 
and noted that among even the best-educated men there 
were few who had mastered its details." 

Mr. Ostrogorski, in his preface, states it to 
be his purpose to " investigate the working of 
democratic government," and adds, " But it is 
not on political forms, it is on political forces 
that I dwell." He holds that 
" The best way to study political forces is to study pol- 
itical methods; ... to really understand the character 
of social action, its modes of procedure must be studied 
in the light of the character of those who apply them, 
and of the social and political conditions in which their 
wills are formed and manifested. It is only in this sense 
that the investigation of political methods will have, in 
addition to a philosophical value, a genuine practical 
valoe. It is a study of the methods of democratic gov- 
ernment conceived in this spirit, a study of social and 
political psychology, based on observation, that I have 
tried to undertake, and it is that which is the aim of 
this book." 

•Dbmockact and thi Oboaxization of Political 
Pabttks. Bj M. Ostrogorski. Translated from the French 
by Frederick Clarke. With a preface by James Bryce. In 
'two Toliunee. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



The author has indeed succeeded in his pur- 
pose of 

" putting together a whole, which, under the form of a 
scientific investigation, alike historical and critical, of 
the rigime of organized parties, is in reality an investi- 
gation of the working of government in democracy, and 
of the vital problems which it puts before existing so- 
ciety and which involve the whole future of our polit- 
ical civilization." 

In pursuit of this great purpose, Mr. Ostro- 
gorski has made a most painstaking and 
thorough study, extending over many years, of 
party organization and party action in both En- 
gland and the United States. These countries 
were chosen, because in them liberty has at- 
tained its highest development ; and because 
there political parties exhibit the greatest regu- 
larity of action. Though in England the organ- 
ization of parties founded on a popular basis 
was more recent than in the United States, the 
author found there an excellent starting-point 
for his investigations. 

The book opens with a striking and compre- 
hensive view of '"The Old Unity "; of apolitical 
society, organized on the basis of aristocracy; 
of the absolute domination of an aristocratic 
class. This is followed by an equally strong 
and clear description of the break-up of the old 
society ; of the advent of democracy, shattering 
in its course " a social fabric which was too 
narrow to contain the national life "; of the 
exaltation of the individual ; of the assertion 
by the many of the right of self-government. 
Then comes an account of the attempts at re- 
action against the rising tide of individualism ; 
of the effort of the Church to restore the old 
unity ; of the Oxford movement, which, starting 
nnder the banner of authority and tradition, 
" succeeded in proving that liberty is, after all, 
the safest principle of conduct in modem so- 
ciety"; of the "Young England" movement 
" to combat the destruction of the old political 
creed which knit classes and individuals to- 
gether"; of the war waged by Thomas Carlyle 
against "the new social system bred of Ben- 
thamism and industrialism," due tohis contempt 
for and hatred of democracy ; of the Christian 
Socialist movement to oppose the principle of 
free competition by means of industrial associa- 
tions. 

The author next describes " The Triumph of 
the New Order," the realization of individual- 
ism in the sphere of politics. With the passing 
of the domination of an aristocratic class and 
the substitution of numbers as the supreme 
power in the state, a new danger appeared. 
The newly emancipated individual ran the

risk of being crushed by numbers. It was not 
enough for him to share sovereignty with his 
fellows. If he would participate in the govern- 
ment, he had to find some extra-legal means of 
cooperation with others seeking similar ends. 
If he would realize his objects in society and 
the state, be must come to an understanding 
with his fellow citizens. 

Liberty emancipated the individual. The 
preservation of liberty itself called for the union 
of individual efforts. Hence arose political par- 
ties. Here lies the field which Mr. Ostrogorski 
has explored with a thoroughness all his own. 
No such examination of the extra-legal cooper- 
ation which has supplied motive power to demo- 
cratic government has before been attempted. 
The book is a veritable storehouse of facts. 
Many of its chapters are purely descriptive. 
Take, for example, the chapter entitled " The 
National Convention." This masterly descrip- 
tion of the vast and tumultuous assemblages, 
in which quadrennially, the party champions 
are chosen, is complete even to the smallest ac- 
cessories. One who has never even heard of 
these modern Olympics can see, as he reads, the 
colossal travesties of popular institutions from 
whence issue the names of those to whom our 
choice of a chief magistrate is limited. With- 
out fear or favor, the author clearly states the 
results of the most searching personal investi- 
gations, extending over some fifteen years, into 
the organization and action of political parties 
in England and America. Holding his conclu- 
sions well in reserve until he has fully set forth 
the facts, he has given the descriptive parts of 
his work the force of a judicial finding. 

Mr. Bryce is not wholly pleased with Mr. 
Ostrogorski's picture of party organization in 
England. While frankly conceding the au- 
thor's description to be on the whole both ac- 
curate and fair, that taken one by one the 
facts stated are almost always correctly stated, 
he thinks that the author exaggerates the power 
and poison of the Caucus and does not suffi- 
ciently allow for the healthy influences that 
tend to correct the dangers its growth may in- 
volve. However, Mr. Bryce proceeds to break 
the force of his "word of caution." He says: 
"I am myself an optimist, almost a professional 
optimist, as indeed politics would be intolerable 
were not a man grimly resolved to see between 
the clouds all the blue sky he can." He adds: 
" Party organization is a totally different thing 
in England from what it is in the United States. 
It is in the hands of a different class of men." 

The word of caution uttered by Mr. Bryce 



touching Mr. Ostrogorski's picture of English 
partyism will be repeated here with reference 
to the vast canvas whereon he has painted 
American partyism with all its deformities. 
Already an American critic has said : " He 
does not mean to exaggerate, and nearly every 
statement, taken by itself, is substantially cor- 
rect. Yet, admitting the several parts of the 
argument, one finds himself objecting to the 
whole." 

It is not enough that one who admits that 
every line is correctly drawn shall object to the 
picture as a whole. He must point out some 
omission or want of proportion, if his objection 
is to have weight. Has Mr. Ostrogorski omitted 
anything essential from his picture of partyism 
in the United States ? Do its lines betray any 
material lack of proportion ? Is it overcharged 
with gloom ? Gloomy it unquestionably is, as 
Mr. Bryce remarks. Yet one will search in 
vain for any important omission from the au- 
thor's description of our party machinery and 
of our party methods. He has faithfully ex- 
amined and correctly described their every de- 
tail of construction, their every mode of action ; 
and he has summarized with substantial accu- 
racy the results. His most obvious error lies 
in his underestimate of the benefits that have 
resulted from the introduction of the Austra- 
lian ballot. Had he been in America in 1888, 
as well as in 1896, Mr. Ostrogorski would have 
realized more fully than he does the value of 
this reform. Its value becomes even more clear 
with every passing year. 

There is a factor, indefinite but real, for 
which Mr. Ostrogorski has not sufficiently al- 
lowed. This is public opinion. Over all our 
political activities broods a public opinion which 
nearly always restrains and sometimes directs. 
The wholesome fear of it usually entertained 
among politicians accounts for the fact, noted 
by Mr. Ostrogorski, that from the nominees of 
our national conventions the people have chosen 
a line of Presidents who, " if they have not all 
been great men, — far from it, — were all hon- 
orable men." The influence of public opinion 
cannot be measured. Mr. Ostrogorski notes 
some of its affirmative triumphs in the passage 
of the civil service, the Australian ballot, and 
recent monetary laws. It is not strange that a 
foreign student should fail fully to realize its 
value as a restraining force and as a ground of 
hope. The marvel is that he has so completely 
mastered and so justly appraised what may be 
really known of our political methods. The 
scientific investigator may be excused from

appraising what may not be examined. Each 
reader, according to his vision, will, with Mr. 
Bryce, see what blue sky he can between the 
clouds of party politics. 

Mr. Ostrogorski passes from party organiza- 
tion and the evils of permanent political parties, 
to a survey of our struggles for emancipation 
since the Civil War, and to a discussion of 
remedies. As the years pass, voluntary asso- 
ciations, alliances, committees, federations, and 
leagues appear ; " scratchers," "mugwumps," 
and " independents " multiply. The sporadic 
committee organized to crush this boss, or to 
smash that machine, at length gives place to the 
compact league of independent voters having a 
definite common purpose. Men, emancipated 
from a party bondage which held them while 
special interests despoiled a continent of vast 
public resources, gradually unite in a wide co- 
operation to rescue their government from 
party spoilsmen. 

Thus far the movement against the evils of 
party domination has been largely confined to 
the sphere of municipal government. Here 
the need was more obvious, but not more real, 
than in the state and nation. 

" Yet the indepeodent morements which have taken 
place in the sphere of the national parties have not re- 
mained unfruitful. If nonpartisanship has made snch 
strides in the municipal field, this is owing to their dis- 
solvent action; mugwumpism, too weak to produce rav- 
ages in the national parlies, penetrated into the mu- 
nicipal sphere following the lines of least resistance. 
. . . However, the national political life itself did not 
whollv escape the new notions about the independence 
of the elector's couscience . . . ; these notions per- 
vaded the political atmosphere, exercising a subtle and 
deleterious influence on the traditional sentiments of 
party loyalty." 

More important than its immediate results, 
the movement which thus far has found its 
main expression in the sphere of municipal 
reform has introduced new methods of public 
action, methods which may stamp or even de- 
termine the future of democracy. But the best 
political methods require the motive power 
supplied by an aggressive public spirit. Too 
few are yet imbued with this spirit. 

" There is a sincere desire to see the machines and 
bosses disappear, but people would like this result to be 
obtained, if possible, in an automatic way, so to speak, 
which would make up for personal exertion. There is, 
therefore, a tendency to look to the legislator to arrange 
the legal machinery in such a fashion as to defeat the 
enemies of good government." 

The constituted authorities have become, 
under party domination, more and more un- 
equal to their oflBcial duties. The leaders of 
opinion rarely seek or occupy public station. 



The initiative has passed even from Congress. 
It acts on impulses coming from without It 
legislates, as to many matters, by direction of 
special interests : it registers, as to matters of 
peculiar public interest, the legislation of vol- 
untary organizations of private citizens. How 
great has been the change from other days, is 
indicated by a single illustration. The demoral- 
ization of the finances due to the Civil War, 
having been allowed by Congress to continue 
for a generation, a national conference of private 
citizens finally initiated a remedial measure. 
Think of an Indianapolis Conference to pre- 
pare financial legislation when Alexander Ham- 
ilton or Salmon P. Chase was secretary of the 
treasury I 

Modern society, when it came into posses- 
sion of liberty, placed its chief reliance on 
parliaments. It sought to escape tyranny by 
hedging its executives about with legal re- 
straints. Disappointed by a bitter experience, 
due at least in large part to the usurpations of 
party, it has turned for relief to a powerful ex- 
ecutive supported by the negative authority of 
the courts. Dictators, from the Speaker of the 
House down to mayors of cities, find themselves 
possessed of the chief powers of government. 
Private initiative having detected and pun- 
ished official malfeasance, cleansed the streets, 
secured public works, and framed legislation, 
found itself unable steadily and effectively to 
check the spoliation of the people by powerful 
groups of citizens acting impersonally as quasi- 
public corporations. 

"To obtain more durable and more regular effects 
than could be achieved by these spasmodic efforts, 
attempts were made to straighten the relaxed govern- 
mental spring by main fotce; inadequacy of action 
being mistaken for inadequacy of powers, the latter 
were concentrated in the hands of a few pereoos." 

This leads Mr. Ostrogorski, in his conclusion, 
to propose a remedy for existing evils. He re- 
gards permanent political parties, having power 
as their end, a mortal danger to democracy. 

"The great parties, viewed as a whole, have been 
throughout their career nothing but agglomerates arti- 
ficially brought together and kept together. . . . Al- 
ways endeavoring to throw a veil over divergences of 
views and to eliminate principles, it substituted for the 
process of analysis and synthesis of opinions, which 
onght to take place in the electorate to create a legis- 
lative assembly animated by one mind and one will, a 
purely artificial analysis and synthesis, obtained by the 
saving grace of the party label. As soon as the mani- 
fold interests jumbled together under this label got ad- 
mitted into the House, they naturally reverted to their 
own particular aspirations." 

The sole concern of the party being to manage 
the elections and win the spoils of victory, it

did nothing to repress these centrifugal tend- 
encies. The result was, in large measure, the 
paralysis of representative government. That 
individual rights have survived is due to the 
simplicity and limited scope of government in 
the United States and the constitutional guar- 
antees of liberty which everywhere prevail, — 
in a word, to the remarkable success of written 
constitutions imposing limitations on govern- 
ment. 

The author would substitute for permanent 
political parties, with power as their end, tem- 
porary combinations of citizens formed specially 
for particular political issues. 

" Party, as a general contractor for the numerous and 
varied problems present and to come, awaiting solution, 
would give place to special organizations, limited to 
particular objects. It would cease to be a medley of 
groups and individuals united by a fictitious agreement, 
and would constitute au association, the homogeneity 
of which would be ensured by its single aim. Party 
holding its members, once they have joined it, in a vice- 
like grasp, would give place to combinations forming 
and re-fotming spontaneously, according to the chang- 
ing problems of life and the play of opinion brought 
about thereby. Citizens who part company on one ques- 
tion would join forces on another." 

Mr. Ostrogorski believes that the substitution 
of temporary for permanent political parties will 
emancipate the individual; that he will never 
wholly surrender himself to party, will always 
realize his liberty as a free man ; and that, freed 
from the nightmare of party " regularity," he 
will exercise his personal judgment. Unlike 
parties of agglomerate creeds, each single-issue 
association will devote itself wholly to the task 
of making converts. " Political society will be 
transformed into a vast school, and democratic 
government will become really a government of 
discussion." 

These suggestions are neither so novel nor 
80 impracticable as may at first appear. The 
old order, with its social unity, is no longer pos- 
sible. In an era of liberty, the harmony of the 
elements of society can be restored only by an 
agreement of wills. The new social synthesis 
required by an emancipated society lies in the 
free union of wills in varied and successive com- 
binations. It cannot be effected once for all and 
about everything. Mr. Ostrogorski points out 
that the existing system is rapidly breaking up. 
Some of the old parties live on the credit of their 
past, which is well nigh exhausted. " Compact 
and stable majorities are only a historical remi- 
niscence." Already the new method appears 
in the form of " committees " and " leagues " 
for definite purposes. The struggle between the 
two modes of political action is on. The cry of 



political evolution is, "Down with 'party'; up 
with 'league.' " 

Mr. Ostrogorski holds no brief for absolution. 
It is not of democracy, but of party, that he de- 
clares : Its life is " only one long school of ser- 
vile submission. All the lessons the citizen 
receives in it are lessons in cowardice." He 
loves democracy so well that he would save it 
from deadly peiil. 

" Men must be taught to use their judgment, and to 
act independently. It is on the accomplishment of this 
work of liberation that the whole future of democracy 
depends. Hitherto the victorious struggle which democ- 
racy has carried on in the world has been mainly, and 
necessarily, a struggle for material liberty ; moral lib- 
erty, which consists in thinking and acting as free reason 
dictates, has yet to be achieved by it. It has carried the 
habeas corpus by force, but the decisive battle of democ- 
racy will be fought on the habeas animum. ... It is the 
political and social forms anterior to democracy that are 
dead. . . . Democracy has brought with it liberty, and 
it has renewed the life of societies." 

The author is under no illusions as to what 
it means to overcome the formalism that op- 
presses democratic government. To him, vic- 
tory does not mean the complete realization by 
means of a single effort of the end proposed. 

" The victories which bring about the political or so- 
cial transformations consist of changes in the trend of 
society towards the oue or the other of the opposing 
principles. However far they may go, these changes 
never entail the absolute triumph of principles, . . . 
but they turn or move society in the direction leading 
to that ideal point to which it can draw nearer by means 
of fresh efforts, without ever reaching it. To gain a few 
points on the indefinite series of degrees, — that is the 
task which confronts each generation, and which should 
satisfy its ambition and its ardor, and also its pride when 
the task is performed." 

The contribution of Mr. Ostrogorski to the 
literature of democracy is a great and valuable 
one. Into this book he has compressed the re- 
sults of many years of exhaustive study. Its 
pages exhibit ripe scholarship, unusual capacity 
for thinking clearly, and a just sense of propor- 
tion. Taken as a whole, it will please neither 
the cheerful optimist who ignores the facts, nor 
the friend of privilege who hates liberty. It 
will be welcomed everywhere by the real friends 
of democracy. 

De Tocqueville wrote a brilliant treatise 
on democracy, illustrated by observations on 
American institutions. Professor Von Hoist 
produced an exhaustive history of American 
constitutions. Mr. Bryce contributed a careful 
survey of the American Commonwealth, par- 
ticularly of its government and politics as a 
whole. Mr. Ostrogorski now adds to this great 
series a scientific and philosophical study of the 
political forces by means of which American

government lives. Each of these foreign ob- 
servers of the greatest of democratic societies 
has made a lasting contribution to the study of 
democracy. Without seeking to compare works 
of dissimilar scope and purpose, it is but just to 
say that the contribution of this Russian scholar 
is one of the most valuable of the series. Stu- 
dents of government, the world over, will turn 
to this book for exact information and critical 
discussion of its most vital problem.

Dr. Bo"wditch of Massachusetts.* 



For three generations the name of Bowditch 
has been identified with original research in 
two important branches of science — mathe- 
matics and medicine. It has also an honor- 
able position in public life and in the records 
of good citizenship. The eminent physician 
who, with rare success, has edited the two vol- 
umes containing the biography and correspond- 
ence of his distinguished father, has rendered 
a valuable service not only to students of sci- 
ence but to students of American history as 
well. As he prefaces the work with the state- 
ment that here is " the personal experience of 
an active Abolitionist," so he has recalled the 
vital incidents of that movement for which his 
father paid willing sacrifice ; at the same time 
he has interwoven abundant revelations of his 
father's devotion to the progress of medicine. 
The public and personal incidents are tactfully 
blended. The childhood days in the Salem 
home, next to the Old Witch House, are told 
with charm. The reader finds in this picture 
of Nathaniel Bowditch, the wise, inspiring 
father of the subject of this sketch, a new fa- 
miliarity of relation with one who is most often 
recalled as the translator of La Place's " Me- 
canique Celeste." With a mind keen for re- 
search, young Henry Bowditch decided, with 
some reluctance, to adopt medicine as his pro- 
fession ; and, college days ended, he went 
abroad to stay two years at foreign schools and 
hospitals. His fathers fame as a mathema- 
tician was his passport to many a noted salon 
besides that of Madame La Place, while his en- 
thusiasm for his work increased rapidly under 
the best of Parisian doctors, notably Dr. Louis, 
who became not alone a teacher but a life-friend 
to the American student. Science, in its theo-

retical and applied phases, did not submerge 
the romantic tendencies of the yonng physi- 
cian, as revealed in letters descriptive of his 
vacation rambles amid the haunts of Burns 
and " Highland Mary." Still more tender and 
reserved is the story of his love for the English 
girl, comrade of his pension experience, whose 
face smiles at the reader with the gracious 
beauty and "sweet records" of seventy years. 
Almost before Dr. Bowditch could establish 
his professional life in Boston, came the open- 
ing discords, soon to become open rupture and 
war, between North and South. In this life- 
history, the familiar incidents of the Garrison 
mob, the escape of the Crafts, and the rendi- 
tion of Simms, are retold with the vividness of 
personal experience. The extracts covering 
these events are taken from the letters of Dr. 
Bowditch, and from his journal-compilation 
entitled "Thirty Years' War of Anti-Slavery." 
In token of friendship for him and common 
zeal in the cause he served. Whittier wrote 
the stirring poem called " Massachusetts to 
Virginia," to be read by Dr. Bowditch at a 
meeting in Ipswich ; while Lowell, for a similar 
occasion, wrote the lines associated with the 
death of Charles Torrey, " Woe Worth the 
Hour." For the imported 8nn-dial,with quaint 
history, placed in front of the Bowditch home- 
stead at Weston, Whittier, in further attesta- 
tion of his friendship, wrote the beautiful stanza 
of aspiration, — 

" With wamiDg hand I mark Time's rapid flight. 
From life's glad moming to its solemn night ; 
Yet, throagh the dear Gad's love I also show 
There's light above me bj the shade below." 

When the exciting events of the fifties had 
been succeeded by the actual conflict, the pa- 
triotic heart and practical mind of Dr. Bow- 
ditch gave their noble services to his country. 
Even when his first-born lay dead on a South- 
ern battle-field, the father stifled his grief and 
worked with renewed vigor to gain better am- 
bulances and hospital-service. In the midst 
of political crises. Dr. Bowditch had continued 
his medical studies, as well as practice, urging 
new modes of treatment for diseases of chest 
and lungs. In this phase of medicine he was 
pioneer in the modern methods that have 
reached further efiSciency through the skill of 
his son. His fame in his profession brought 
him appointments of honor in this country, 
notably as a member of the National Board of 
Health ; and when he paid visits to Europe, 
in later life, he was greeted with dual acclaim, 
on his own as well as his father's record, by

scientists of England and the continent. He 
modestly makes but casual mention of these 
tributes, but prefers to narrate at length a 
night walk with the police through East Lon- 
don streets, — interesting to him in his philan- 
thropic profession, and especially associated 
with memories of Dickens and his studies of 
London life. If the latter portion of the biog- 
raphy seems somewhat discursive and common- 
place in contrast with the earlier events of more 
vital interest, there is a delight in following the 
serene years to their close in 1892, — the fit- 
ting end of a life of pure, high service to hu- 
manity. Annie Russell Marble. 



Remote Regions and Peoples of 
Mexico.* 



For the past twenty years, Mexico has been 
a much " written-up " country. There have 
been books upon books about Mexico, until it 
seemed that every phase of the subject had been 
exhaustively treated, and that Mexico was no 
longer terra incognita. But it occurred to the 
mind of Dr. Carl Lumholtz, a few years ago, 
that there was still an unknown Mexico, — a 
region that had escaped the attention of the rail- 
road and mining prospectors and of pleasure- 
seeking travellers ; a region beyond the ken of 
the Mexican scientists, and even of the Mexican 
Government ; a region that might hold a secret 
of great importance regarding the native races 
of America. A year or more spent among can- 
nibalistic blacks in Australia had deepened his 
interest in the study of savage and barbaric 
races, and he had decided to make that study 
his life-work. This scientifically unexplored 
region was therefore more attractive to him 
than any other, and he began forthwith to devise 
ways and means for a journey of discovery 
thither. By dint of much effort, he succeeded 
in engaging the interests of the American 
Museum of Natural History, the American 
Geographical Society, and many public-spirited 
men and women of the United States, and a 
fund was subscribed to enable him to pursue his 
scientific researches. In 1890 he made a pre- 
liminary visit to the Zuni, Navajo, and Moqui 
Indians, upon our Southwestern borders ; and 
then proceeded to the City of Mexico, to secure

the interest of President Diaz in his scientific 
enterprises. There is in Mexico no Bureau of 
Ethnology, such as we have in this country ; 
but the broad-minded and progressive states- 
man who is the President of the Mexican Re- 
public hailed with enthusiasm the proposition 
of Dr. Lumholtz, and furthered the ends of the 
enterprise to the fullest extent in his power. 

Thus accredited and equipped. Dr. Lumholtz 
set out upon his explorations in the western 
ranges of the Sierra Madre in Northwestern 
Mexico, at the head of an organized party of 
thirty men, including geographers, geologists, 
mineralogists, zoologists, botanists, archaeolog- 
ists, photographers, guides, cooks, muleteers, 
and requiring the services of nearly a hundred 
animals. But the corps of scientific assistants 
was gradually reduced, and finally altogether 
disbanded. The enterprising explorer was left 
alone to continue his researches. An early 
result was that he was able to return to the 
United States, in August, 1893, with an exten- 
sive collection of Tarahumare and Tepehuane 
ethnological specimens to be exhibited at the 
World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. 

Meanwhile, his fullest expectations had been 
realized by his finding among the Tarahumare 
Indians actual cave-dwellers. With deepened 
interest, he set out, in March, 1894, upon a more 
extensive expedition, which lasted three years. 
On this trip he was without scientific compan- 
ions, and " roughed it " for the most part with 
the Indians. During these years the privileged 
few who had access to the published proceed- 
ings and bulletins of the American Museum of 
Natural History, the American Geographical 
Society, and kindred organizations, might have 
informed themselves of some very important 
ethnological and archaeological discoveries that 
were being made in Northwestern Mexico ; and 
readers of " Scribner's Magazine " could not 
have failed to become interested in some arti- 
cles from the pen of Dr. Lumholtz, regarding 
the cave-dwelling of the Tarahumares. Eigh- 
teen months were spent among these Indians, 
and ten months among the Coras and Huichols ; 
and much knowledge was gained of the North 
and South Tepehuanes, the Tepeeanos, the 
Nahuas (whom we usually call the Aztecs), and 
the Tarascoa. A supplementary expedition was 
made, with Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, in 1898, extend- 
ing over three or four months, and including 
another visit to the Tarahumares and Huichols.

Dr. Lumholtz so won the confidence of the 
people that in many cases he was permitted to

witness their most sacred religious ceremonies, 
to take photographs of the various ethnological 
types which presented themselves for his in- 
Testigation, to make collections of articles nsed 
in their ceremonials and even of skulls from 
their burial-places. He not only filled his 
note-books with data regarding the geology, 
the flora and fauna of the country, and with 
ethnological observations of the most valuable 
character, but he acquired a general knowl- 
edge of the languages in use among these 
tribes, and made extensive collections of an- 
thropological measurements, samples of hair, 
osseous remains, aboriginal melodies, folk-lore, 
myths, and traditions. 

The story of these expeditions by Dr. Lam- 
holtz, and of his life among the Indians, we 
DOW have in two sumptuous octavo volumes, 
containing more than 1000 pages, illustrated 
with 530 half-tone reproductions of photo- 
graphs taken by the author, besides sixteen 
plates in color and three excellent maps, — 
altogether the most valuable contribution that 
has been made of recent years to the literature 
of scientific exploration and discovery in the 
Western World. The author's pleasant liter- 
ary style, his keen sense of humor, and bis 
kindly philosophy, take these volumes out of 
the category of purely scientific works and 
make them of deep interest to the general 
reader, who will find scarcely a dull page in 
either volume. The story is one of adventures 
of an unusual sort, all simply told and without 
any striving after effects. More than once the 
author and his scientific treasures had a narrow 
escape from total destruction, as was the case 
at a ranch in the state of Michoacan, where he 
accepted the proffer of a bed-room. His Indian 
servant lit a candle, and, perceiving a jar in a 
box near the bed, tried to use it as a candle- 
stick. Fortunately, his efforts to stick the taper 
in the mouth of the jar were unsuccessful, for 
the host presently stepped forward, remarking 
quietly, " It is better to put the candle some- 
where else, because this is dynamite." 

The summing up by Dr. Lumholtz, of 
his experiences after he had reached quasi- 
civilization, is calculated to make ethnologists 
of us all. Only those who have enjoyed the 
delights of being in close touch with nature can 
understand and appreciate the fascination which 
that region, not yet reached by man's aggres- 
sive spirit, had for him. He suffered much 
in Mexico. Malaria has a peculiar power of 
making one feel the misery of life ; but the 
pleasant memories of his stay in Northwestern 



Mexico far outranked the disagreeable. He 
never felt lonely among the Indians. So much 
was constantly happening in that little world 
of theirs, that he could not help feeling inter- 
ested and stimulated in observing and studying 
them. Sharing their joys and sorrows, enter- 
ing into their thoughts, and learning to under- 
stand their lore and their traditions, he felt him- 
self carried back thousands of years into the 
early stages of human history. Primitive people 
taught him a new philosophy of life, for their 
ignorance is nearer the truth than our preju- 
dice ; and though they have much to learn 
from us, we also have many things to learn 
from them besides those things which are 
coldly set down in scientific reports.

Shakkspkark axd Voltaire.* 



An exceedingly interesting chapter of liter- 
ary history is that which recounts the gradual 
progress of the revolt against the spirit and doc- 
trine of classicism, as they had been elaborated 
and refined in France in the grand siecie, and 
had triumphantly invaded the other literatures 
of Europe. The part that the works of Shakes- 
peare played in this reaction is well known. 
It has several times been made the subject of 
special studies. It is a portion of this field that 
Professor Lonnsbury cultivates in the second 
Tolnme of his series co ^' Shakespearean Wars." 
In this volume he has set himself the task 
of telling the story of Voltaire's relations to 
Shakespeare, "of the influence originally ex- 
erted upon him by the English dramatist, of 
the war he waged against the latter's growing 
reputation on the continent, of the hostility 
evoked in turn towards himself in England." 
It is the latter story that has professedly en- 
gaged the author's particular attention, and 
the chapters devoted to it contain perhaps the 
freshest material of the volume. But these 
chapters make up rather less than a quarter of 
the four hundred and fifty pages of the whole. 
The others turn pretty closely about Voltaire's 
dealings with Shakespeare, and this story has 
Ions: since been made familiar to us. After the 
special studies of which it had been the object, 
there was not much of real importance to be 
gleaned from a new search of the field. Of 
Voltaire's first references to Shakespeare, from 
which we might infer an appreciation that he

really never had, and which afterwards seemed 
to him to have been responsible for the spread- 
ing knowledge of the English dramatist in 
France ; of his later efforts to undo the mis- 
chief he fancied he had wrought ; of his nu- 
merous borrowings from Shakespeare, and his 
reticence with regard to them ; of his unscru- 
pulous tactics in controversy and his shameless 
mendacity, — of all this we were already abun- 
dantly informed. Professor Lounsbury has 
gone into this story with greater detail than 
his predecessors, but without modifying essen- 
tially our view of Voltaire's attitude toward 
works so teeming with interest and power and 
human reality that they compelled his curious 
wonder and surprise, yet cast in a mould alike 
so repugnant aesthetically to his sense of beauty 
and irreconcilable with his reasoned theories 
of art, and mirroring a world of feeling and 
action so innocent of the jurisdiction of the 
convenances of life in a salon, that he was sin- 
cerely repelled, shocked, and disgusted. In- 
deed, our general view of Voltaire's attitude 
is rather obscured by the fulness of the nar- 
rative and the emphasis laid upon its separate 
episodes. The stress laid upon the bitterness 
of Voltaire's later criticisms of Shakespeare 
easily creates the impression that his view of 
the qualities of his dramatic works had shifted 
with time and the dangerous literary toleration 
that he observed about him. The correcting 
statement of the concluding chapter, that " there 
was never any real change in Voltaire's opinion 
about Shakespeare," is therefore distinctly 
called for. 

Professor Lounsbury is careful to tell us, in 
his preface, that he proposes to confine himself 
strictly to the story of Voltaire's relations with 
Shakespeare ; and he distinctly disclaims all in- 
tention of setting these in their historical per- 
spective as apart of the history of Shakespeare's 
invasion of France. That, in spite of this dis- 
claimer, he feels the disadvantage of thus isola- 
ting his actors from their background, is shown 
by his filling it in at several points, seeing rightly 
that it was necessary to the understanding of 
their feelings and utterances. It is to be regret- 
ted that he did not also bring them into connec- 
tion with the larger background of the general 
movement of ideas of the time. One might 
easily carry away the impression that the revolt 
against classicism was wholly a result of the 
spreading knowledge of Shakespeare's works. 
One does not feel quite sure that this is not 
Professor Lounsbury's view, so completely does 
he ignore that part of the anti-classical current 



that was wholly independent of Shakespeare. 
The influence of Shakespeare's works in break- 
ing down the tradition of classicism was enor- 
mous, doubtless ; but it was not alone, nor would 
it have been of itself sufficient. To give it 
such exclusive emphasis magnifies unduly the 
doctrinal and formal element among literary 
influences, and leaves out of account the close 
dependence of literature upon life. No amount 
of familiarity with the works of Shakespeare in 
the original tongue could have given the public 
of the age of Louis XIV. any misgivings as to 
the authority of the classical rules. Those rules, 
and the conception of dramatic art which they 
embody, were too closely connected with the 
ideas upon which the whole life and society of 
the time rested, and no amount of argument 
and no sympathetic interpretation of foreign 
literatures could have availed to shake the au- 
thority of those rules so long as life conformed 
unhesitatingly to those ideas. The romantic 
drama of Spain was by no means unknown to 
the founders of the French classical tradition, 
but this knowledge did not modify in any degree 
the rigorous development of the classical form- 
ula. Could the works of Shakespeare have 
circulated in France in the latter half of the 
seventeenth century, it is impossible to believe 
that representatives of French culture could 
have read them except by a powerful and con- 
stant effort of the will. That these works were 
greeted with eager curiosity by a considerable 
public in the middle of the eighteenth century, 
is not more prophetic of changes that were to 
overtake the received poetic creed in France 
than significant of changes that had already 
taken place in French society and ideas. The 
famous quarrel between the Ancients and the 
Moderns was a very empty affair so long as both 
parties were at one as to the sufficiency of the 
ideals that shaped life and conduct throughout 
the recognized "monde" under the great Louis. 
It was not till the insufiiciency of these ideals 
began to be felt, with an accompanying sense of 
irritation and restlessness at the narrowness of 
the horizons to which, with all their distinction 
and elegance, they had condemned men's out- 
look over the world, that the forms of classical 
art were seriously questioned. And if, after all, 
the eighteenth century came but to a very im- 
perfect comprehension of Shakespeare's art, it 
was primarily because it still came to the pic- 
ture of life he gave with the inherited habits 
and preconceptions of the elegant courtly ideal. 
Indeed, it may be suggested that if Voltaire 
seemed at the moment of leaving England more

THE DIAL

open to the appeal of Shakespeare than ever 
afterward, it was because the outlines of his 
courtly ideal were at that moment a little 
dimmed, and the immediate impressions of life 
uppermost with him were those received from 
English society. It is to be regretted, then, that 
Professor Lounsbury did not give us a glimpse 
of those new elements of a wider and different 
outlook on life that the eighteenth century was 
accumulating. 

If this dependence of literary form and 
theory upon the larger background of national 
culture and the general theory and practice of 
living is not taken account of as one would 
wish it were, it is yet here and there more or 
less fully implied, and once at least plainly 
asserted. "No literature of any sort," the 
author says, " can succeed permanently which 
does not strike its roots deep down into the 
national character and life." The application 
he makes of this view to French literature 
shows perhaps why it seems to have been so 
o-enerally disregarded in his treatment of his 
subject. For he denies to the drama of French 
classicism that deep foundation in the national 
character and life that alone may support en- 
during fame. One must conclude, then, that 
the works of Racine and Corneille have lost 
their power to charm French audiences, or that 
Professor Lounsbury knows that they certainly 
will lose it. The question of the future may 
very well be appealed to that court of last re- 
sort that alone can pronounce the final judg- 
ment. But as to the present, does Professor 
Lounsbury mean to say that the success of the 
French classical drama has already come to an 
end? With what grief and horror such an 
opinion would fill M. Brunetiere I And on 
-what shall we base our judgment of the present 
success of authors of more than two centuries 
ago ? What proofs could we give of the vitality 
of Shakespeare's works for the great English- 
speaking world that could not be matched with 
equal evidences of the continued favor of the 
classical masterpieces for the French public? 
This is one of the difficulties that arise from 
Professor Lounsbury's view that the French 
classical drama is not a national product, and 
that the differences that separate the drama of 
the age of Louis XIV. from that of the age of 
Elizabeth are not those which separate the two 
nations, but only such as separate a special class, 
an elite aristocracy, from the whole people. 

"The P-iiglish theatre was the theatre of the nation; 
the French was the theatre of a class. The energy, the 
liberty, the disregard of useless conventions which 
Voltaire had found in the drama of the land to which 



he had come, were not really due, as he fancied, to the 
different character of the people, any more than was 
what was in his eyes its rudeness, its license, its dis- 
regard of decorum. Similarly, the elegance, the deli- 
cacy, the beauty of the drama of which he boasted, did 
not owe their existence to the character of the people 
he had left behind, any more than did the monotony, 
the lifelessness, the dull dialogue of which he constantly 
complained. These are not and cannot be distinctive 
features of the stages of different nations in which 
social life is essentially the same; they are the marks 
which distinguish the drama of an aristocracy from 
that of a whole people. Results essentially alike would 
have followed in each country, had the conditions been 
alike." 

Yes, — no doubt like results would have fol- 
lowed like conditions. But just in the like- 
ness or unlikeness of conditions lies the whole 
matter. Has unlikeness of conditions no sig- 
nificance as to likeness of national character? 
Could conditions so immensely different as 
those of France and England at the time of 
their literary blossoming have come about with 
essential identity of character in the two peo- 
ples? Or, if such different conditions could 
be imposed upon two peoples of like characters, 
would they not of necessity speedily diverge ? 
Without stopping to examine within what 
limits, if at all, the assertion is true that the 
French classical drama is that of an aristocracy, 
while that of England is the drama of a whole 
people, one cannot help wondering upon what 
it depended, if national character was in no 
wise concerned, that the theatres played such 
a vastly different part in the two countries. 

It is, no doubt. Professor Lounsbury's en- 
thusiastic devotion to Shakespeare that has kept 
him from putting himself at the standpoint of 
French classicism and doing it fuU justice, as it 
has led him to emphasize so specially the role 
of Shakespeare's works as a literary influence. 
It is this same devotion that has prompted him 
to ascribe to Voltaire a feeling that he pretty 
certainly never had. " It is hard to escape from 
the impression that in Voltaire's inmost soul 
there lurked, in spite of his colossal self-conceit, 
a vague consciousness of inferiority, whenever 
he came to measure himself with the great 
dramatist. He was overpowered by something, 
he knew not what." Surely. French observers 
of Voltaire have had no difficulty in escaping 
from this impression. 

But we shall not blame this devotion, since 
to it we owe also the fullest and most minute 
presentation that the relations of Voltaire to 
Shakespeare have yet found, or are likely to 
find ; and we need not find fault if it is fuller 
than we think it need have been.

[March 16^ 



Nkw York: Past and Present.* 



The author of "New Amsterdam and Its Peo- 
ple," Mr. J. H. Innes, is inclined to regret that 
the " Knickerbocker History of New York " 
was ever written, inasmuch as its burlesque cre- 
ations have become impressed on the popular 
mind to the exclusion of the real facts regard- 
ing the city, which even in its early days was 
cosmopolitan in population, containing men of 
many nations besides the Dutch. Mr. Innes's 
work bears as a secondary title, " Studies, So- 
cial and Topographical, of the Town under 
Dutch and Early English Rule "; but the lat- 
ter part of this caption is scarcely accurate, for 
after a rapid sketch of the earlier history of the 
settlement, the author selects the year 1655 — 
when, as he says. New Amsterdam had begun 
to assume the appearance of a settled town — 
as the period of his survey. One is inclined 
to wonder why he did not decide on 1653, when 
the burgomasters were appointed, and which 
year, as Fiske says, " may be cited as marking 
a new era for the Dutch province." 

The author's plan is simple. Starting with 
the White Horse Tavern, at the head of Broad 
Street, he works gradually down to the neigh- 
borhood known as " the Ferry," where the re- 
motest houses stood in 1665. He describes the 
topography of the town, street by street, com- 
paring it constantly with the same streets of 
to-day. He gives a sketch of the history of 
each building and its owners or dwellers, of ne- 
cessity looking backwards and forwards from 
his chosen date. Among the more interesting 
chapters are those dealing with the West India 
Company and its Colonial Officers, Dominie 
Bogardus, Cornells Melyn the patroon of Staten 
Island, Jacob Steendam the poet, the " Great 
Tavern " afterwards the Stadt Huys or Town 
Hall, and Govert Loockermans and his family. 
The author goes somewhat out of his way to give 
the history of Captain Kidd, who does not be- 
long to this period, and to discuss the identity 
of William Paterson, a Scotchman who settled 
in New Amsterdam for a time, and who may 
possibly have been the founder of the Bank of 
England. 

Mr. Innes, who has obtained his information 
from the original records, frequently differs 

•New Amsterdam and Its People. Studies, Social and 
Topographical, of the Town under Dutch and Early English 
Rule. By J. H. Innes. Illustrated. New York: Charles 
Scribner's Sons.

Landmarks. By Rufus Rockwell Wilson. In two volumes.

from the former investigators, notably Valen- 
tine ; but he fortifies himself by proofs, gen- 
erally beyond dispute, — as in his claim for 
Jan Vinje (Jean Vigne), rather than Sarah 
Rapalje, as being the first child of European 
parentage born in New Netherlands. The 
author's rhetorical style is not especially to be 
commended, and he has a fashion of somewhat 
lengthy sentimental allusions to old-world 
scenes and events that is somewhat confusing. 
Nevertheless, the book is full of the material 
of history and romance, and worthy of careful 
study. 

Mr. Rufus Rockwell Wilson's " New York, 
Old and New " is larger in plan and less min- 
ute in detail than the work of Mr. Innes. It 
is, moreover, intended primarily as a gift-book, 
and is therefore more popular in style. It is 
bound in two attractive volumes, with numer- 
ous illustrations but no maps, and a fairly good 
index. To those who have read the author's 
previous works it is unnecessary to say that 
these volumes are entertaining, and to many 
they will certainly be instructive as well. 

Mr. Wilson does not name the authorities 
for his facts, except in a few scattered instan- 
ces ; but inasmuch as he does not put forward 
any new discoveries, we may reasonably infer 
that he bases his work upon Mrs. Lamb, Val- 
entine, and other well-known writers. Indeed, 
he says in his preface that "the preparation of 
this work necessarily involved a study of every 
noteworthy authority." In other words, he is 
the conservative chronicler, rather than an 
original investigator like Mr. Innes. He has 
succeeded very well in his endeavors to make 
an interesting sketch of New York's history 
"for the busy reader of slender purse," and to 
give it careful and impartial treatment. 

The first volume contains a consecutive his- 
tory of the city, outlining briefly the main 
events from Hudson's time down to the forma- 
tion of " Greater New York." The survey is 
necessarily rapid, but the author finds space 
for descriptive chapters touching the social and 
topographical conditions in each period. He 
has placed emphasis throughout on what he 
calls the personal element ; that is, he has the 
story-teller's touch, and has seized upon the 
picturesque at some sacrifice of dry details, 
dates, etc. The second volume is concerned 
with New York of the present day, and takes 
the reader on numerous strolls through the 
city, locating places that have historic or other 
interest. Here there is necessarily some repe-

tition of matter that is in the first volnme, bat 
not enough to be annoying. The district cov- 
ered includes not only the old city, as in " New 
Amsterdam and its People," but also the north- 
ern end of the island, including Harlem and 
the "Neutral ground." There is also a chapter 
entitled *' Little Sisters of Manhattan," treat- 
ing of the neighboring islands — Governor's, 
Bedloe's, Ward's, etc. Many interesting an- 
ecdotes bearing on the old Dutch burghers, 
governors, and lords of the manor, on the town 
under English rule, and on the Revolutionary 
period, are here given, as well as much pleasant 
gossip about the players, writers, and other 
residents of the town in the early and middle 
part of the last century. Some items are fa- 
miliar enough, but many are altogether new. 

The most serious fault of Mr. Wilson's work, 
in our estimation, is the frequent use of quota- 
tions without specifying their authors, and the 
entire absence of notes. The author also stands 
convicted of the use of the split infinitive, an- 
noying to so many readers. However, these 
faults do not prevent the work from being a 
more complete supplementary guide-book to 
New York than any of its predecessors, as well 
as very interesting reading besides.

Several articles on the political and 
social aspects of modern Germany, 
by Mr. Wolf von Schierbrand, have 
appeared in recent years in oar prominent periodi- 
cals. Their aathor has now collected them and ex- 
tended the series to a ^ood-sized volnme, which is 
published under the title, •• Germany : the Welding 
of a World Power" (Donbledaj. Page & Co.). 
Mr. von Schierbrand is a naturalized American 
eitixen, and for a number of years represented the 
Aaaoeiated Press in Berlin. He ha« therefore had 
exceptional advantages for the preparation of his 
book ; he has not, however, risen above the style 
or the view-point of the ordinary newspaper corre- 
spondent. His book is interesting, at times gossipy, 
occasionally suggestive, but never profound or dis- 
criminating. Thus, the chapters on the Emperor 
present him simply as known by common report in 
the better classes of Berlin society. It is not a 
picture that adds to onr knowledge of the man or 
to our appreciation of his motives. Occasionally 
the illostrations of contradictory elements in the 
imperial policy — the phrase *' imperial antics " is, 
by the way, to be deprecated — are striking. Thns, 
William II. championed the reduction of classics 
and the introduction of broader technical training 



in the schools ; at the same time he urged the l,tx 
Arous, which subjected University tutors to the 
rig^d supervision of the Minister of Education, and 
thus threatened the boasted Lehrfreiheit of German 
academic instruction. Some examination of the 
reasons for this and similar contradictory positions 
would be instructive and valuable. The point of 
view throughout is that of modem Berlin, and the 
author's attitude is unsympathetic The description 
of social life is startling in the f rankneaa with iriiieh 
it deals with certun phases of contemporaiy soeiely, 
but it would be deplorable were we to believe that 
the German nation is really so corrupt and so given 
over to luxury as it would seem. The jonmalist's 
desire to be " readable " is too apparent No doubt 
the modern Berlin professor is a man of the world, 
but the picture drawn by Mr. von Sehier)»«iid is as 
litUe typical of German academic teaehen, as a 
dMs, as was the caricature of Fliegende Blatter, 
whieh he mistook for a type. life in general is 
really more genuine and less ^schneidtg" than it 
afipean on the mutmee, or as presented in this hook. 
Ontain du^iten, eepedallj those on the Agrarian 
and the Socialist movements, are worth commenda- 
tion ; that on Literature and Art, on the contrary, 
is singularly weak and unsatisfactory. On the 
whole the book is entertaining, but it can by no 
means be accepted as an authoritative discussion of 
the problems with which it deals. 

TtiMiisili ilili for its clearness and 
bnedth of insight is the art-criti- 
cism given us by Mr. W. E. Henley 
in his little volume of " Views and Beviews : EaBays 
in Art Appreciation" (Seribner). The book eon- 
Mts ot abort enays and notes, most of them written 
S dosen yean age ; and, as the author states in the 
preface, scarcely changed and in no way modem- 
ixed. He has written with a fine contempt not only 
for public opinion, but also for all other critics, witli 
the two exceptions of Eugene Fromentin and R. A. M. 
Stevenson (a cousin of Robert Louis), in praise of 
whom he devotes his last essay, under the title : " A 
Critic of Art." What Mr. Henley's own art-criti- 
cism aims at, is best told in his own language : ^ At 
least I may claim to have read few books into my 
pictures, to have done my best to keep my painting 
more or less unlettered, to have proffered my con- 
clusions, such as they are, fairly well purged of senti- 
ment. So did not Haxlitt, nor Ruskin ; and, if it 
must be that I faU with these, I doubt not (such is 
the vanity of man) that I shall take a sour pleaaara 
in reflecting that, be things as they may, my faOme 
is not on all-fours with theirs." He beg^ins with early 
romanticism, of which movement he has a great deal 
to say. and always from the point of view of the wor- 
shipper of a cult. In tracing the development of the 
painter's art, he brings into close comparison the 
products of the sculptors, musicians, poets, novelists, 
and even actors, of the same time ; treating them all 
as parts of the great romantic movement, each in- 
fluencing the others. He sometimes becomes involved

in the great mass of his material ; but his first essay 
is headed " A Note on Romanticism," and so we 
cannot find fault if he has occasionally sacrificed 
logic for a delightful little side-excursion. " Profiles 
Romantiques," which forms the second part of the 
book, is a series of short and trenchant sketches of 
nearly all the great romantic artists. Each one is 
Bummed up with a keenness that displays a knowl- 
edge of technique extraordinary in a layman. Mr. 
Henley's enthusiasms are given to Corot, Delacroix, 
Rousseau, and Monticelli, — in general, everything 
French ; for, in speaking of Meissonier, he says : 
" The truth is, he is French of the French : French 
in his care for microscopic detail, French in his pa- 
tient ingenuity and his conscientious disdain for 
what seems to him bad work, French in the neat- 
ness of his ambitions, French in the dry impersonal 
quality of his color, the deftness of his handiwork, 
the logical effect of his line, the trim assurance of 
his effects." Only five Dutchmen are mentioned in 
the book ; but the Fnglish are treated at length, and 
Constable is given the place of highest favor, — 
Constable, the disciple of Claude. In addition to its 
other excellencies, Mr. Henley's book succeeds in 
presenting a larger view of the scope of art and of 
the art-critic. He is not satisfied with himself till he 
has subjected each picture to the brightest search- 
light of analysis ; and he is not satisfied with a pic- 
ture that cannot stand all his tests. One of his 
simplest tenets is that " Imitation for its own sake 
is the basest of aims, and the pursuit of it can have 
but the meanest of results." 



A definOive ^^ ^** ""^y * ^^'^ months ago that 

«Kti<m de luxe an American firm began the publi- 
o/FitzOeraid. cation of a " Variorum and Defini- 
tive" edition of Edward FitzGerald's writings, con- 
taining in seven large volumes the various versions 
and revisions of all the published works. Now we 
have before us the first instalment of a '* definitive 
edition de luxe " of the same author, also in seven 
volumes, bearing in this case the imprint of Fitz- 
Gerald's authorized publishers, the Messrs. Mac- 
millan, and edited by his literary executor, Mr. W. 
Aldis Wright. The nearly simultaneous appear- 
ance of two such publishing enterprises would nat- 
urally bring them into rather direct comparison ; 
bat as it happens a just comparison is not possible 
in this instance, the editorial plans of the two edi- 
tions being wholly dissimilar. Each supplements 
the other, and the FitzGerald enthusiast will not 
be content unless both repose upon his shelves. If 
confined to one or the other, our own choice would 
rest with the English edition, on several accounts. 
We are of those who prefer their English authors 
in English dress, for one thing. For another, we 
are content with FitzGerald's work in the form 
which he finally gave it, without regard to the in- 
termediate revisions and changes — interesting as 
these often are. But the main reason for our pref- 
erence lies in the fact that the English edition con- 
tains the Letters, which being still in copyright 



were unavailable for the American undertaking. 
FitzGerald's other prose works are of small account 
in comparison with the Letters; even the Omar para- 
phrase has not so good a chance with posterity as 
those incomparable documents in which the Wood- 
bridge philosopher revealed to a few intimate friends 
the depths of his rarely beautiful personality. The 
collection here given us by Mr. Wright includes all 
the known correspondence, comprising the original 
series published in 1889, the additional letters 
contained in the " Eversley " edition of 1894, the 
" Letters to Fanny Kemble " of 1895, and the 
" More Letters " of 1901. All these are now ar- 
ranged, as they should be for the best enjoyment 
of the reader, in chronological order, instead of the 
previous arbitrary groups, and occupy four of the 
seven volumes comprising the present edition. The 
remaining volumes contain the sum of FitzGerald's 
published literary work and translations — the "little 
escapades in print," as he himself used to call them. 
Mr. Wright's introduction to the collected edition 
of 1889 and his elucidative passages and notes in 
the Letters are reprinted here, but otherwise the 
editorial matter is almost entirely FitzGerald's own. 
The external setting of the edition is irreproachable 
in nearly all details, the cfe Itixe character being main- 
tained without loss of simplicity or dignity. Possibly 
the binding might be considered a trifle too ornate to 
accord with the sober genius of " old Fitz "; but it 
is no less striking and effective on that account. 
Each volume contains a frontispiece portrait in 
photogravure. Unless the letters to James Sped- 
ding should miraculously come to light, this must 
remain the final edition of FitzGerald's complete 
writings.

those who seek instruction in the art of sanitary 
living in matters of personal and public hygiene,

(Macmillan) a most complete and satisfactory 
treatise. The writer for many years has been 
the biologist of the Massachusetts State Board of 
Health, and has rendered public service in matters 
of water supplies, sewage disposal, and other phases 
of public hygiene under municipal or state control, 
unsurpassed for the scientific thoroughness with 
which the work has been done. This book is written 
with special reference to the causation and preven- 
tion of infectious diseases, and presents in simple 
and logical form the fundamental scientific prin- 
ciples on which the great practical arts of modern 
sanitation securely rest. It is the outcome of a course

largely from the antbor's experience in dealing with 
problems of sanitation. It treats the subject broadly, 
dealing with the basic principles underlying the phi- 
losophy of cleanness, rather than their immediate 
application, and while it is thoronghly scientific it is 
by no means too technical for the intelligent reader. 
It treats of the nature of infections and contagions 
diseases, and the means of their dissemination and 
control, of toxins and antitoxins, and of asepsis and 
antisepsis, with simplicity and clearness. Not only 
will physicians and municipal engineers find the 
work of great value, but its presence in every in- 
stitution and school and home would do much to 
lessen the risk of disease and death, and serve in 
no small measure to correct some popular and all 
too-prevalent fallacies concerning the nature and 
cause of diseases, and the necessity of preventative 
measures for the protection of the individual and 

the community. 

An admirable treatise on "Title 
Pages," by Mr. Theodore L. De- 
Vinne, is published by the Century 
Co. This book, which belongs to a series on the 
practice of typography, by one who is a master of 
the art, is like a spring of cool water in a dry land, 
or a good blast of common-sense in the weary waste 
of sentimental disquisitions about printing which 
has been so abundant of late from amateurs and 
pretenders. Mr. De Vinne divides his treatise into 
three parU — Historical, Practical, and Critical, 
which makes a very nice set of distinctions ; and it 
has, furthermore, no less than twenty-three pages 
of index for four hundred of reading-matter. The 
text of a treatise on title-pages of course deals with 
type and other allied subjects ; and Mr. De Vinne 
writes of them all in a style that is clear and sane, 
— qualities evidently due to that perspective and 
sense of proportion which come from long study 
and familiarity with a subject, and a conviction of 
its importance and interest. At the end is a title- 
page in ten different styles, showing the varieties of 
treatment possible. The illustrations are numerous, 
and fully carry out the clear expository character of 
the text. The treatise will be found indispensable 
to all in any way connected with the making of 
books, while its interest will not be confined to 
these, but will extend to all who have any taste or 
fancy in typography.

less of Tennyson the man than of Tennyson the 
poet, the writer touches on some of his less familiar 
qualities. His artistic taste and skill are attested by 
the cover of the book, which bears a spray of ivy 
as carved by him from nature. The design was 
employed in the decorative terra-eotta moulding 
around the windows of a model cottage on his es- 
tate. To his young niece the poet gave a solemn 
charge to let the world know " how great a sacri- 
fice " he had made in accepting, at Mr. Gladstone's 
pressing entreaty, the offered peerage. The devout 
side of his nature receives fresh illustration in these 
pages. The freedom of the human will and the 
starry heavens he considered the two greatest of 
marvels. Pointing to a recently felled horse-chestnut 
tree that still put forth its blossoms, he likened it 
" to some men who appear blooming outwardly whilst 
they are already dead within." His going down on his 
knees to kindle a fire for a newly arrived guest, and 
his haste to answer the letter of a frenzied German 
who threatened to kill himself unless he secured the 
poet's autograph before a certain date, illustrate the 
simple human kindness of the man. Reminiscences 
of Charles and Horatio Tennyson, Mrs. Cameron, 
Edward Bowen and his brother, "W. G. Ward, and 
other of Tennyson's relatives and friends, give added 
value to the little book, which is rendered still further 
attractive by some interesting portraits and an ap- 
pendix containing selections from the late Bertram 
Tennyson's privately printed prose and verse. 

Dr. George M. Gould, a FhUadel- 
phia ophthalmologist, has written a 
little book on •' Biographic Clinics " 
(Blakiston), that should prove a veritable eye- 
oi>ener, in more senses than one. A pathological 
study of the lives of DeQaincey, Carlyle, Darwin, 
Huxley, and Browning, leads the author to the con- 
clusion that their recorded physical ailments were 
largely due to eye-strain, resulting from astigmatism 
and easily curable at any time by spectacles of the 
right kind. It was not opium, he feels assured, that 
so nearly wrecked DeQaincey's life, but defective 
vision. Study thus brought on other disorders, and 
opium probably saved his life, instead of almost kill- 
ing him as the " Confessions " would lead one to in- 
fer. Stress is laid on the theory of reflexes. The 
eye, an all-important and most delicate organ, shifts, 
if it can, the penalty of its abuse on to other and less 
delicate organs. Until recently the real cause of 
countless cases of headache, dyspepsia, insomnia, 
biliousness, etc, remained unsuspected. Dr. S. Weir 
Mitchell is duly honored as the one who, thirty years 
ago, first recognized the pathologic significance of 
astigmatism. A more than pathologic significance, 
according to Liebreich, the Berlin ocalist, attaches to 
it in the case of the artist Turner, the peculiar char- 
acter of whose pictures is thought to be due to the 
painter's astigmatism ; so that if these pictures were 
viewed through proper astigmatic lenses, their Turn- 
erism would vanish. The lay reader queries whether 
Dr. Gould does not push his theory pretty far ; but

at any rate his book is suggestive and helpful. A very 
beneficent, practical application of his ideas would 
be, as he points out, the printing of all books, were 
it feasible, in white ink on black paper, and also 
the doing away with gaudy gilt picture-frames. Eye- 
strain would thus be materially lessened. 

An account of Rev. George Willis Cooke, whose 
Unitatianism occasional writings on matters of 
in Amerxca. church and religion in America have 
given indication of his capacity to grapple with these 
themes on a larger scale, has at last completed his 
history of" Unitarianism in America," which he had 
originally intended to bring out three years ago, at 
the time of the seventy-fifth anniversary celebration 
of the American Unitarian Association, by which 
body the book is now published ; but the task of 
preparing the work was too great to admit of its 
earlier appearance. Mr. Cooke was neither born a 
Unitarian, nor was Unitarianism thrust upon him. 
He achieved it by struggle and search. Conse- 
quently he is well fitted to act as guide to other 
inquirers. He wisely chooses to dwell rather on 
what Unitarianism concretely is and what are its 
fruits, than on the theological controversies that 
marked its birth and early history. Hence he de- 
votes large portions of his book to such matters as 
Sunday-school work, missions, reforms, philanthro- 
pies, education. Unitarian men and women, and 
Unitarianism in literature. Our early and middle 
nineteenth-century literature presents such a pre- 
ponderance of Unitarian writers that they would 
seem to be more readily designated by noting ex- 
ceptions than by giving a list. Other departments 
of worthy activity are almost equally rich in men 
and women of that liberal faith that so naturally 
prompts to good works and broad philanthropy. 
The book is a most serviceable manual of reference, 
and as a record of Unitarian achievement in Amer- 
ica it supplies a want never before so satisfactorily 
filled. 

The last century has witnessed as- 
Mdaga^ tounding strides in the science of phi- 

lology ; and perhaps in no branch 
of it has such progress been made as in the investi- 
gation of the old languages of Southwestern Asia. 
Mr. Arthur John Booth, in "The Discovery and 
Decipherment of the Trilingual Cuneiform Inscrip- 
tions" (Longmans), retells the story of Rawlinson's 
great feat in 1835-1846. He prefaces this, how- 
ever, by two long chapters giving an account of the 
principal explorers of the Babylonian Valley and 
Persia, beginning with 1472 A.D. Here we find 
several incidents of value that have not been noticed 
by modern writers. Mr. Booth aims to give the 
reader a definite idea of the contribution made by 
each traveller to the final and culminating task of 
reading the ancient languages of Persia. To most 
scholars, especially to the archseologists, these first 
two chapters will be of most value. The remainder 
of the book is a rehearsal of matter already well 
known to scholars and amply spread before the pub-

lie in several popular works. The older literature 
has been utilized, and the author's method of treat- 
ment indicates that be is not handling the inscrip- 
tions as an expert. The publishers' catalogue of 
forty pages bound up with the book is in question- 
able taste. , 

Mr. C. H. A. Bjerregaard, the li- 
brarian of the New York Public Li- 
brary, and a well-known authority 
on mystical and oriental subjects, has provided the 
material for the large volume entitled " Sufi Inter- 
pretations of the Quatrains of Omar Khayyam and 
FitzGerald " ( J. F. Taylor & Co.). Necessarily, the 
labor and erudition which have gone into the mak- 
ing of this work are to be appreciated only by those 
who possess in some degree the mystical tempera- 
ment. The language in which FitzGerald's pellucid 
stanzas are clothed have for such readers an inter- 
pretation far beyond the ordinary meaning of lan- 
guage, either prosaic or poetic. The universe and its 
most abstruse problems, the intricacies of all philos- 
ophy and morality, and the curious learning of re- 
condite thinkers through many ages, are woven into 
the Rub^iy^t as Mr. Bjerregaard reads them ; and 
he discloses all these things to those who care for 
and can understand them. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. T. H. Delabfere May has prepared a blank verse 
translation of the "iEaeid," which ia published iu two 
volumes by Mr. David Nutt. The translator's aim has 
been the production of a version " which should be as 
helpful to the student as an ordinary prose crib and 
more easily remembered." The translation is faithful 
and not unpleasing, and the lines are numbered accord- 
ing to those of Virgil, although of course considerably 
more numerous. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., have sent us the 
thirty-second annual edition of their popular " Satchel 
Guide for the Vacation Tourist in Europe," as revised 
and brought up to date by Dr. W. J. Rolfe, who happily 
combines Shakespearian editing with European touring, 
and thus indefinitely prolongs a useful life. Dr. Rolfe 
really does correct this little book every year, which is 
more than can be said for some books that pretend to 
undergo an annual revision. Even the fall of the Cam- 
panile at Venice is noted. 

"La Perfecta Casada," a moral treatise of the six- 
teenth century by Fray Luys de Leon, is reprinted from 
the third edition (1587), with variants from the first.Jas 
a volume of the Decennial Publications of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. The editorial work is done by Miss 
Elizabeth Wallace, who contributes footnotes and an in- 
troduction. This editorial matter, which is all in Span- 
ish, comprises a bibliography of the more important 
editions, a comparative study of the first and third, and 
some notes on the author's prose style. An index of 
quoted passages appears at the end of the volume, for 
the good priest drew freely upon the Scriptures, the 
Fathers of the Church, and the Greek and Latin writ- 
ers. This work belongs to the^octavo series of the Uni- 
versity Publications.

published in a handsomely illustrated volume by the 
Jewish Publication Society of America. 

" Stories of Old France," by Miss Leila Webster

volume on art and the philosophy of beauty, prepared 
by Prof. John Ward Stimson, will be published this

Mr. Ralph Fletcher Seymour is the publisher of

" A Short History of Rome," by Mr. W . S. Robinson, 
is published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. It is 
a schoolbook pure and simple, designed for the upper

esting in treatment as is possible for a text so crammed 
with statements of bare fact.

The Chantanqoa reading for this year indodee a 
element of interest, whieb is the ezplanatioB of 
Isabel F. Hapgood's •'SorreT of Russian Litera-

Fteaa. The book is essentially a compilation of the 
npiainns of RmwisB enties, in which character is its 
^eeial value. 

The series of " English Glassies " pnblished by MesMs. 
Lcmgmaas, Gre«n, & Co. has jost been increased by 
three Tolames. Scott's - Lady of the Lake " is edited 
by Professor G. R. Carpenter, Irring's " Oliver Gold-

containing three of Tennyson's "Idyls of the King' is 
edited by Miss Sophie Chaotal Hart.

Mr. Curtis Hidden Page, of the songs and sonnets of 
Pierre de Ronsard. 

••Funds and their Uses," by Dr. Frederiek A.

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. The book offers a de-

iianilnj 1 11 in modem finsaeial tiaBaaelaoas,'*aad is illos- 
tiatod by many facsimile e^raviags of eheqoes, drafts,

book, and one moch needed. 

"La Lign^ dee Pontes Fran^ais an XIXe Sitele," 
by M. Charles Bonnier, is a pretty booklet pnblisbed 
by the Oxford Clarendon Press. It contains a series of 
extracts from French poetry, from LamartiBe and 
Yigay to R^gnier and Verhsren, forming the " links 
ia an nnbroken ehaia" of development in form and 
thoogfat. An essay *'it la M^ moire de St^phane Mal- 
larm^ " is given at the close of the volome. 

While the best rf onr printing trade journals do not 
overlook altogether the artislie sheets of their subject, 
it is the technicol and eomasereial phtsoii that chiefly 
occupy their space. So there has ka^ beea not only 
room, but actoal need, for such a periodical as " The 
Printing Art," lately launched by the University Press 
of Cambridge, which intends to deal with modem typog- 
raphy and book-making entirely from the artistic stand-

sad is desigaed for advanced hi gh seh o ol work or for

of the national government in its history, its pditieal 
philosophy, and its practical workings. There are, to 
be snre, two brief chapters on the states aad territories^ 
but these are clearly in the nature of an appendix to 
the main work. Professor Woodbam's volume seems to

be found highly nseful by teachers of pnlitiesl t

AS A WORKING TOOL 

For the student and the writer, as an authoritative reference book for schools, families, and business men, there is one book 
which offers superior advantages both in the solid value of its information, and the ease with which it is obtained. 

One's admiration for Webster's International Dictionary increases daily as it comes to be better known. It never refuses 
the information sought and it never overwhelms one with a mass of misinformation illogically arranged. 

THE ST. JAMES GAZETTE of London, England, says : For the teacher, the pupil, the student, and the litterateur, there is nothing 
better ; it covers everything. 

The New and Enlarged Edition recently issued has 26,000 new words and phrases, 2364 pages and 5000 illustrations.

Richard Bagofs New Novel 

DONNA DIANA 

By Richard Bagot, author of " Casting of Nets," 
" A Roman Mystery," etc. Crown 8vo, cloth, 
gilt top, $1.50. 

" Himself fascinated by Rome, Mr. Bag;ot has under- 
stood her exquisite poetry ; he has studied her attributes 
as well as her humanity, and has giren us a veritable 
chef-d'oeuvre of observation, style, and interest. . . . 
A book which will stand out as a happy exception among 
novels on Italian subjects — a perfect work of art." — 
L'ltalie, Rome. 

" Whether Mr. Richard Bagot has really penetrated 
the recesses of Roman Catholic consciousness we may 
not know, but certainly if what he writes is not true it 
has a marvellous appearance of it. . . . Of the story, as 
a story, we have space to say only that it is well told, 
and holds the interest for its own sake unflagging to the 
end."— Churchman, New York, 

"Mr. Bagot's substantial knowledge of Roman life 
has contributed a great deal toward giving vitality to the 
social groups depicted in the pages of ' Donna Diana,' 
and there is much else that gives the romance considera- 
ble human and artistic effect." — Baltimore News. 

" The study of the heroine's temperament, wrought 
upon by experiences and circumstances with which she 
is ill-qualified to cope, is delicate and interesting." — 
New York Tribune.

Mr. GEORGE HORTON'S Latest Book and Greatest Literary Success 

In Argolis 

Is meeting with praise from the highest authorities of ENGLAND and AMERICA 

THE ATHEN/EUM (London) says: 

" We know no brief study of modem Greek life that is either more true or more attractiTe. His wanderings 
through lemon orchards and green lanes, with the sea in hearing, and the nightingales forgetting that it is daj, 
make charming pages. . . . For Mr. Horton is both a-poet and a humorist. . . . We warmly conmiend his charming 
book to all classes of our readers." 

THE NATION (New York) says : 

" Any one who has ever sojourned in Greece, or loved it from afar, will enjoy ' In Argolis,' and will read it 
more than once, in memory of skies and scenes and a people that must always haunt his imagination. And any 
gentle reader who knows nothing of Greece will find in these little pictures of a life that is far from strenuous 
something rare and genuine that approaches the qualities of a classic. He, too, will read this little book, if not 
for loTe of Greece, for love of literature and humanity." 

THE CHURCHMAN (New York) says : 

" We cannot say good-by to this really charming book without a word of commendation to the publishers 
for the singularly attractive form they have given alike to the pages and their binding.'' 

"in Argolis" is a beautiful little volume to be read and kept and lovingly re-read. 
It is printed in tlie most distinctive manner of the .fVlerrymount Press, Boston, and illus- 
trated with full-page pictures in tint. In box, $1.20 net.

BOOKS FOR NATURE LOVERS 



/;/ Mr. John BURROUGHS' S 
remarkable paper in the March 
"Atlantic" on "Real and Sham 
Natural History," be says : 

"Mr. Leander S. Keyser's Birds 
of the Rockies tells me just what 
I want to know abont the Western 
birds — their place in the landscape 
and in the season, and how they 
agree with and differ from our East- 
ern species. Mr. Keyser belongs 
to the noble order of walkers and 
trampers, and is a true observer 
and bird-lover." 

Beautifully Illustrated, $3.00 net. 



It is of especial importance to the reader of 
a nature book to have it aeeurate, he must also 
feel that it is comprehensive, and if in addition 
it is delightfully written he has discovered a 
really good book indeed. 



This is exactly what may 
be said of Mrs. Wheelock's

Kent Fort Manor 

By William Henry Babcock, author of " The Tower of Wye." (Griffin Series.) 
Illustrated by W. Sherman Potts. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

The scene of Mr. Babcock's new novel is laid in the Chesapeake Bav, and several of 
the chief characters are descendants of the William Claiborne who figures in his former book, 
but the time is that of the Civil War. There is a curious psychological problem of inherited 
memory involved in the plot which is sure to attract attention and interest. 

" The interest of this weird novel centres around a hypothesis tentatively broached by 
the author that there is such a thing as heredity of memory.' — Pittsburg Dispatch. 

The Archierey of Samara 

A Russian novel, by Henry Iliowizi, author of "The Weird Orient," "In the

This is a thrilling story of some very interesting phases of Russian life by one who knows 
his subject thoroughly, having been born and passed his early years in the Russian province 
of which he writes. It will be found of absorbing interest and of much sociological value. 

" A romance, yet it is a great deal more than that. It is history, philosophy, and 
romance combined." — Philadelphia Record.

SIX IMPORTANT BOOKS 



Now Ready 
RICHARD ROSNY 

By Maxwell Gray, author of "The Silence of Dean Maitland," etc. Photogravure Frontispiece, 

i2mo. Cloth, ;gi.50. 
" ' Richard Rosny ' does not belong to the fiction of the commonplace. It shows great strength 
and uncommon art." — St. Louis Star. 



The History of Puerto Rico 

By R. A. Van Middeloyk. With an Introduction by 
Prof. Martin G. Brumbaugh. (Expansion of the 
Republic Series.) i2mo. Illustrated. Cloth, $1.25 
net (postage 1 2 cents additional). 

Puerto Rico has an interesting history. Its four cen- 
turies under Spanish control is a record of unusual and 
remarkable events. But this record has remained un- 
known to the American people. It has never been 
written satisfactorily even in the Spanish language. The 
author is the first to give English readers a record of 
Spanish rule in this "pearl of the Antilles." 

The Stirrup Cup 

By J. Aubrey Tyson. (Novelette de Luxe Series.) 
i2mo. Gilt top. Cloth, jSi.25. 
Mr. Tyson has written an American story which 
seems certain of popularity. It deals with the early life 
of Aaron Burr, his first courtship and marriage. This 
is a most agreeable part of Burr's life to those who regret 
the later clouds that injured his reputation. Mr. Tyson 
has told the story with much cleverness and refinement. 
In literary craftsmanship he has risen to a level distinctly 
above the average in current fiction. 



Horace Greeley 



By William A. Linn, author of "The Story of the 
Mormons" ; formerly Managing Editor Neiv Tori 
Evening Post. (Historic Lives Series.) i2mo. Illus- 
trated. Cloth, jSi.oo net (postage 10 cents additional). 
It is remarkable that so little has been written about 
Greeley since he died ; in fact, since Parton's book 
appeared, just before the civil war, no one has under- 
taken a comprehensive life of Greeley. Greeley's own 
autobiography, which he called "Recollections of a 
Busy Life," has been the only later work of note to 
which readers could go, and that book has not been in 
general circulation for a great many years. Mr. Linn's 
volume, therefore, had a large public waiting to receive it. 

A Virginia Girl in the Civil War 

Being the Authentic Experiences of a Confederate Ma- 
jor's Wife who followed her Husband into Camp at 
the outbreak of the War, dined and supped with Gen- 
eral J. E. B. Stuart, ran the Blockade to Baltimore, 
and was in Richmond when it was evacuated. Col- 
lected and Edited by Myrta Lockett Avary. i2mo. 
Cloth, jti. 25 net (postage 12 cents additional). Second' 
Edition.

LETTERS OF CHARLES DARWIN 

Edited by Francis Darwin. Two vols., 500 pages each. Eight photogravures and eight half- 
tones. Cloth, gilt top, deckle edges, boxed, ^5.00 net. Uniform with "The Life and Letters 
of Huxley." 

Much interest has been shown in the announcement of this work. The two volumes will in 
no way disappoint readers, for it will soon be discovered that Francis Darwin's biography of his 
father, while made up largely of letters, left unprinted an extremely valuable epistolary collection. 
The new letters are not alone scientific in the subjects they treat of; they are often personal, and 
delightfully so. They reveal in Darwin that persuasive and irresistable charm which men of real 
eminence always possess when to great talent they join simplicity and unaffected sincerity.

POSTHUMOUS AND CONTEMPORARY 
FAME. 



I 



In our days, fame is more quickly attained 
than in times past. It is safe to say that the 
future historian of our age will not have to 
record the sad fact which must be recorded of 
the many past ages, that its greatest men have 
lived in obscurity, and that to their names none 
but posthumous fame has been attached. Not 
that genius is sure of immediate recognition 
now, but that it is much more likely to secure 
it than in times past. Given to-day a man of 
intellectual power, endowed with good vitality, 
and having a fair amount of self-assertion, he 
need not remain neglected unless he choose. 



If he have anything to say which is worth the 
world's attention, he can secure it, as a rule, 
without waiting too long for it. Of course a 
man of genius may die young as well now as 
ever before, and receive the recognition due 
him when too late, but with a moderately long 
life he can count upon securing an audience to 
some extent commensurable with his ambition, 
during that lifetime. 

The judgments of no age concerning itself 
are to be taken as wholly conclusive. It may 
well be that posterity will place different esti- 
mates from ours upon the work of many of the 
men of our age, but the general truth remains 
that these judgments of ours, taken as a whole, 
more closely approximate to those which will 
receive the sanction of posterity than the judg- 
ments of past ages concerning themselves have 
approached the final estimate of mankind. 

This statement is obviously insusceptible of 
proof, but it is possible to point out strong rea- 
sons for believing it to be substantially true. 
There are two chief reasons why genius in times 
past has often received only the tardy recogni- 
tion of posterity. It has either failed to present 
itself fairly to the attention of its age, or, if this 
has been secured, its embodiment, thus pre- 
sented to the world for judgment, has been so far 
in advance of the age in which it has appeared 
that it has not been understood, and has found 
meaning only to the advanced intelligence of 
some later period. The first of these causes may 
be said to have been very largely done away 
with, so largely as no longer to prevail in any 
marked degree in depriving a person of the re- 
cognition due to his achievements. The second 
cause of course remains as before, but we shall 
find upon examination that it is of much less 
consequence than the first, for the cases are few 
in which thought, once brought well before the 
attention of an age, has not been able to secure 
an audience, if a small one, among the most 
advanced thinkers of the age, while there are 
countless instances in which thought has been 
prevented from exercising its due influence by 
lacking the means of bringing itself into gen- 
eral notice, and the prevalence of error has 
thereby been made possible, although the truth 
may have been fully known to a few. 

Briefly, then, our age has witnessed so mar- 



230 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



vellous an increase in the facilities for inter- 
course and the interchange of ideas that it 
would be a difficult matter for any expression 
of unusual ability to remain long unnoticed, and 
that any such expression, once brought to the 
attention of a large public, could hardly be so 
far in advance of that public as not to find 
some few capable of estimating it at its real 
value, and assigning it the place fitting it in 
the structure of human achievement. The most 
universally accepted opinions of an age are 
really the opinions of a few of the clearest 
thinkers of that age, supported blindly by the 
great mass of people, who always have been 
and always will be incapable of forming valid 
judgments for themselves on any of the more 
abstract subjects of thought with which an age 
is called upon to deal. Now the conditions of 
our present age are such that not only is the 
expression of new thought practically sure of 
whatever audience the age can furnish it with, 
but also that the few or many who are found 
capable of appreciating it are enabled to give 
their judgment more immediate effect in direct- 
ing the general judgment of the age than would 
be possible were the means of intercourse less 
numerous than they are. In consequence of 
all this our age has witnessed many unwonted 
spectacles, among them that of a man of sci- 
entific genius who, less than half a century ago, 
propounded a theory that seemed the height of 
speculative extravagance to all but the few of 
clear vision whose attention was called to it, a 
theory that was opposed to all the preexisting 
opinions on the subject with which it dealt, and 
had to encounter, perhaps, a greater amount of 
conservative resistance than was ever before en- 
countered by any theory, yet which, in spite of 
all obstacles, has in this less than half a cen- 
tury acquired for itself a place in biology an- 
alogous to that occupied by the law of gravi- 
tation in physics, and has revolutionized the 
sciences of organic life. Similarly, in the do- 
main of art, we have seen a composer of genius 
boldly reject the accepted canons of musical 
composition, denounce as trivial that which 
was generally looked upon as being truest and 
highest, and, striking out for himself in a new 
and little explored path, create a music as 
widely at variance with existing fashion as 
might well be, claiming for music and conquer- 
ing in her name a wider province than that 
over which she had previously held sway, and 
all this in the face of the most determined op- 
position, an opposition which made unscrupu- 
lous use of all the weapons that came to hand. 



and was^ unsparing of ridicule, that most potent 
appeal of the vulgar to the vulgar ; this also 
we have seen, and we can record with satisfac- 
tion that the man to whose untiring activity it 
was all due lived to see realized the proudest 
dream of his life, and died with no mere cer- 
tainty of posthumous fame, such as might have 
been his sole portion in an earlier age, but 
having seen the triumph of his work, having 
received during life the crown of recognized 
success. 

In view of these considerations it may be 
maintained that the oft-repeated assertion that 
the men and work of an age can only be judged 
fairly by a succeeding one has become divested 
of whatever truth it may once have had, and, 
in support of this, there may be instanced the 
many cases in which new thoughts and crea- 
tions have received what we have no reason to 
believe to be other than a permanent valuation 
in the very age which has given them birth. 
The sad history of genius in past ages seems 
to have produced a sort of conviction that, of 
necessity, it must ever be so with great men 
and great ideas ; a conviction which does not 
pause to inquire into the conditions which have 
hitherto made this history what we know it to 
have been, or to ask if they obtain now as they 
have in the past. That the judgments of our 
age in many matters of theory are of no merely 
provisional nature, but such as we may con- 
fidently accept as in no danger of being re- 
versed, is sufficiently clear, for they appeal 
directly to the reasoning faculties, and the 
reason once satisfied, the matter is ended, for, 
in the words of Schopenhauer, " so long indeed 
as the truth does not appear, error will have 
full play, as owls and bats fly about in the 
night ; but we may sooner expect that owls and 
bats will frighten back to its bed the orient 
sun, than that truth, once recognized and clearly 
enunciated, will be pushed aside in order that 
the old error may resume its place. For in this 
is the very strength of truth, that her victory 
is indeed gained hardly and at much cost, but, 
once gained, is never to be taken from her." 

The permanence of our aesthetic judgments 
is more open to dispute, for in these matters 
the canons of criticism have not the immu- 
table character possessed by those employed in 
abstract reasoning, and yet it may be asserted 
with some confidence that even in matters of 
this kind we are not without being justified in 
the assumption that, with due exercise of the 
greater care made imperative by the more com- 
plex conditions dealt with, we may arrive at 



1903.]

231 



eonclasions which shall have an objective va- 
lidity. The idea is gradually taking hold of 
men's minds that aesthetic judgments are more 
than opinions : that there is a right and a 
wrong in art, and that this may be clearly 
pointed out ; that we may have an intellectaal 
recognition of the value of a poem or a picture 
which shall be something apart from and quite 
different from our personal likings, which may 
indeed be wholly opposed to them. If this as- 
sumption be not unwarranted we may proceed 
to the study of the artistic no less that of the 
scientific manifestations of the present, with 
some confidence that we may, with due care, form 
estimates which shall be of more than subjec- 
tive value. Had Shakespeare lived in the nine- 
teenth century instead of in the sixteenth, we 
may rest assured that he would have found an 
appreciative audience, and one whose verdict 
would only have become confirmed by the cen- 
turies following. It is, of course, this Tery 
confirmation which sets the seal upon such a 
verdict, but for those who returned it, it would 
have needed no such confirmation. 

It may, of course, be urged that we are all 
children of our age, and that this alone makes 
it impossible for us to judge objectively of pro- 
ductions which appeal not only to our intellect 
but to our feelings. This plea has a certain 
force, but it is the very recognition of the fact 
that we are the children of our age, and the 
clear perception of the characteristics of that 
age, which will be our best safeguard, for it 
will afford us a criterion by which we may dis- 
tinguish the objective in our personal estimate 
from the subjective. Most people place a 
Talue upon works of art according as they are 
interested by them. This valuation is purely 
subjective and worthless. Above these there is 
a lesser number of those who, imbued with 
the spirit of their age. judge works of art 
favorably or unfavorably according as they 
give expression to that spirit. This judgment 
has in the place of the subjectivity of the indi- 
vidual the larger subjectivity of the age, and 
has a high relative value, but may be reversed 
by another generation. Highest of all we 
find the few who, while carried along in the 
current of the thoughts and aims of their age, 
keep their heads above the level of the stream, 
and realize its relations to the past and the 
future. These are of their age, but they see 
beyond it : they have a sense of the unity of 
past, present, and future ; their judgment is 
more or less objective, and has a correspond- 
ingly high absolute value.

English Society vxdkb the Georges.* 

A few unpublished letters and an army offi- 
cer's manuscript account of a South African 
campaign, eked out with material from contem- 
porary memoirs and magazines, and all gener- 
ously embellished with reproductions of por- 
traits and curious prints, have furnished forth a 
volume of considerable interest in Mr. George 
Paston's " Side-Lights on the Georgian Period." 
The first chapter, "A Burney Friendship," 
treats of the friendly relations and correspond- 
ence between the Burneys and Mary Ann Port, 
who afterward became Mrs. Waddington. The 
latter's granddaughter, Mrs. Herbert of Llan- 
over, has placed the letters at the author's dis- 
posal, and from these, as well as from Madame 
D' Arblay's published "Diary and Letters," Mr. 
Paston has given us a pleasing, although rather 
stiff and old-maidish, portrait of the talented au- 
thor of "Evelina.'" One of Miss Port's early ad- 
mirers. Colonel Manners, is introduced for our 
amusement. The simple-hearted Colonel com- 
plained that whenever he was about to speak on 
any topic in the House of Commons, Mr. Pitt 
invariably anticipated him and went through 
the whole subject so thoroughly as to leave 
others nothing to say. He declared he had 
never voted but once against his conscience, 
and that was for the " bacheldors' tax," which 
he held to be unconstitutional ; for, he asks, 
" how can a man help being a bacheldor if no- 
body will have him ? And, besides, it's not any 
fault to be taxed for, because we did not make 
ourselves bacheldors, for no one was born mar- 
ried, so we were made bacheldors by God." 
And ao we dismiss him with the punning 
couplet, — 

"Gentle Manners, with affections mild, 
In wit a man, simplicity a child." 

Mrs. Carew, daughter of Dr. Burney's early 
friend and patron, Fulke Greville, and one of 
the famous beauties of her time, is praised for 
her youthful charm even as a middle-aged ma- 
tron with grown-up children. Miss Burney says 
she " uglified " everybody near her, and that 
her son might have passed for an elder brother. 
The best of the letters quoted are those written, 
not by Miss Burney, in her elegant Johnsonese 
and with that touch of grandiloquence so sug- 
gestive of egoism, but by the dear old musician,

her father. Here is one of his written at the 
age of eighty-three to Mrs. Waddington : 

"My Dearest Madam, — The Median and Persian 
laws by which I at present exist are the following : I 
never quit my bower till twelve o'clock, when, in toler- 
able weather, I take an old lady's drive about Hyde 
Park, and in summer walk in Kensington Gardens till 
near two — then devote the third hour to calling on 
dear friends who interested themselves about my health 
during my confinement by personal inquiries at my door 
without being let in — and since the few warm days that 
succeeded our Nova Zembla frigidity, set me up, and en- 
abled me to go into my parlour, or chambre d'audience, 
I gave notice to the elect ladies ou my list that I should 
be visible from three to five o'clock, after which I dine, 
read, or hear reading, and write or dictate letters, but 
never more will be out after sunset. But I have a 
trick of waking at sunrise, and if not in acute pain, 
read or write in bed till ten or eleven o'clock. Such is 
the monotonous life of your very old and affectionate 
servant, Chakles Burney." 

The good doctor, writing of Catalini's singing, 
dwells only on its merits, leaving its defects 
for others to censure. " Praise is harder than 
finding fault," he says, and wisely chooses the 
more difficult part. He deprecates the giving 
of so enormous pay (two hundred pounds for 
each performance) to the prima donna, and 
foresees the evils of the star system. The 
gentle doctor of music was said to be the only 
man to whom Dr. Johnson had ever uttered 
the words, " I beg your pardon, sir." 

In the second chapter, on "The Illustrated 
Magazine," attention is called to the curious 
fact that the recent rise of the pictorial monthly 
is but a repetition of what took place a hun- 
dred years earlier. Between 1765 and 1800 
a group of illustrated magazines sprang into 
being which compare not unfavorably with 
their modern successors in England, albeit 
eclipsed by American publications of a similar 
kind. But even their names are now unfa- 
miliar. How many readers have ever heard 
of The Town and Country Magazine, The 
Westminster, The Oxford, The Sentimental, 
The Maccaroni, The Matrimonial, The Lady's, 
The Fashionable, or The Magazine a la Mode? 
Dull enough, to be sure, their reading matter 
would now seem to us ; but their copper-plate 
engravings are a relief to the eye wearied by 
an excess of process prints. 

Akin in interest to the foregoing, but dis- 
cussed in a later chapter, is the literary review. 
Mention is made chiefly of The Monthly Re- 
view (1749-1845) and its shorter-lived rival, 
The Critical Review (1766-1791). To the 
Monthly's fine-print list of less important pub- 
lications the reviewer, with almost invariable 
lack of prophetic wisdom, relegated the books 



that afterward achieved fame. The editor. Dr. 
Griffiths, meets with scant respect from Mr. Pas- 
ton, who refers slightingly to his title with the ex- 
planation that " he had some American diplo- 
oma." As a matter of fact, it was the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania that, unsolicited, conferred 
upon him the degree of LL.D., of which we may 
conclude that he was not wholly unworthy, as^ 
honorary degrees go ; for the author admits that 
he was reputed a firm friend, a lover of domes- 
tic life, a steady advocate of literature, an ex- 
cellent companion, and a veritable encyclopaedia 
of literary anecdote and reminiscence. As 
one of the pioneers in a useful department of 
literature, he certainly deserves honor and 
praise, whatever the shortcomings of his mag- 
azine. And he seems not to have miscon- 
ceived the function of a critical review. No 
present-day London editor could state the case 
more tersely than did the Monthly in the fol- 
lowing reply to an aggrieved author: 

" The design of our work is mistaken by such as- 
suppose it to be the business of the reviewers to set 
every wrong-headed author right. They think it in gen- 
eral sufficient that they point out the principal defects- 
in the performance of such mistaken writers, who 
would do well, instead of persisting in their errors, and 
growing impatient under well-meant reproof, to sub- 
mit with patience, and profit by just correction." 

The ideal woman of the Georgian period 
seems to have been very nearly what the men 
demanded that she should be, — "fine by de- 
fect and amiably weak." The latter half of the 
eighteenth century abounded in manuals of 
advice to young women, written by old womea 
of both sexes. Dr. Johnson especially admired 
a little treatise by Joshua Reynolds's sister, in- 
culcating the principle that " the love of praise 
in a female breast should never transcend th& 
domestic sphere ; perhaps the most perfect fem- 
inine mind aims at nothing higher than an ex- 
emption from blame." Let those who pine 
for woman's complete emancipation review the 
progresss achieved in one short century, and 
take courage. 

From the now forgotten autobiography of 
Mrs. Eliza (Dawson) Fletcher, whom the au- 
thor styles an English Madame Roland, one 
gets a fresh glimpse of eighteenth-century 
people and manners. Here is Miss Edgeworth's 
portrait, sketched with no flattering hand : 

" Miss Edgeworth's personal appearance is not at- 
tractive, but her vivacity, good humour, and cleverness 
in conversation quite equalled my expectations. I 
should say she was more sprightly than refined ; she 
excelled in the raoiness of Irish humour, but the great 
defect of her manner was an excess of compliment, or 
what in Ireland is called ' blarney '; and in one who

had moved in the best circles it surprised me a little. 
She repelled all approach to intimacy on my part by 
the excess of her complimentary reception when we 
were first introduced to each other. I never felt con- 
^denee in the reality of what she said afterwards." 

The author takes occasion unnecessarily to 
signify his disapproval of pro-Boer sentiments 
and his low estimate of the Boer character. He 
drags in a chapter entitled " The South Afri- 
can War," with extracts from a manuscript by 
Sir John Malcolm, an officer in the Cape Colony 
campaign of 1795. He informs us that " his- 
tory repeats itself — more especially in South 
Africa."' The only repetition apparent lies in 
the British passion for dominion and in John 
Ball's disregard of the other man's territorial 
rights. 

The narrative, toward the close, runs a little 
thin and watery, the final pages giving a sus- 
picion of space-writing. So hard-pressed is the 
author for matter at last that bis concluding 
chapter, "An American in England," is made 
up of extracts from so well-known a book as 
the life and letters of George Ticknor, from 
which he culls many of the anecdotes long ago 
used by Whipple and other reviewers of the 
work. In this case, therefore, it can hardly be 
.said, jinis coronal opus. 

Percy F. Bickxell. 



The Social Unrest.* 



One's first thought on finishing a perusal of 
Mr. Brooks's volume on "The Social Unrest" 
is: Why was not such a book written some 
time ago ? A second and more deliberate opin- 
ion is, that this is the most satisfactory book in 
the field of social study for many a day, and 
that its production is a supreme accomplish- 
ment. Such a book, with its careful investi- 
gation, its temperate view of every side of a 
dispute, its large sympathy, its recognition of 
the evolutionary order of things, makes such 
widely blazoned works as those of Kidd seem 
very empty of the solid matter of which the 
real world is composed, and brings into notice, 
by very force of contrast, the unsubstantiality 
of much of the so-called social science of the 
day. Its spirit is wholly admirable, and its at- 
mosphere is the one in which the real struggles 
of society are going on all about us. Its ap- 
pearance in the first months of the present year,

MoTemeots. B7 John Oiaham Brooks. New York: Tha 
Ifamrillaa Co. 



on the heels of the greatest industrial upheaval 
in history, is very timely. 

The purpose of the book may be expressed 
in the words with which the third chapter 
opens. It is 

" to analyze the nature of our own social anre«t ; to 
mark some of its more undeniable tendencies; to aak 
if it is growing, or, if not growing, is it taking on any 
threatening peculiarity to justify alarm? Can it be 
maintained that ours is an unrest different in any essen- 
tial from the ferment which for centuries has stirred 
the heart and the imagination of humanity? In the 
current literature on social and industrial questions 
nothing, even by economists of repute, is more com- 
i monly asserted." 

> Mr. Brooks partly refutes and partly endorses 
this assertion in the suggestion that 
" if the people of any past century had possessed our 
machinery for telling and spreading their fears, their 
gossip, their corruptions, their tragedies, they would 
appear to us like a people of whom we had never 
heard. This new facility for the utterance of our com- 
plaints becomes also a cause of the eviL To insist 
loudly and incessantly that things are ill, is to help 
make them so, although there is some hope that the 
sheer din of the caviller may tend at last to beget 
insensibility and iodifferenoe, as exoesuTe advertis- 
ing may sometimes defeat itself by its dreary unirer- 
sality." 

As an explanation of the increasing unrest, 
stress is laid on the altered circumstances in 
this country where the chances for common- 
place and average ability are becoming less 
and less, as those for special ability become 
greater and greater. "Three acres and a cow " 
translated into the vocabulary of the working 
man no longer means comfort as it did a gen- 
eration or so ago. The standard of living, in- 
terpreted by " a living wage," has been as im- 
perious a tyrant as the worst type of indus- 
trial master. 

" Workingmen, and more especially their wives, who 
hare once gained the income of modest comfort, have 
something to lose, upon which great price is set, and 
therefore organize, strike, and struggle, often in most 
regrettable ways, to maintain that standard. ... It is 
the sense of insecurity, lest these symbols of getting on 
in the world may at any time be lost, that is at present, as 
it is long likely to remain, one of the deepest and most 
justifiable sources of discontent. Nothing is so habitu- 
ally ignored, in attempts to understand industrial strug- 
gles, as the force and preralenee of this sentiment." 

Other causes are found in the spread of popu- 
lar education with the consequent democratic 
ideas, and in the decay of authority in religion. 
One rebel said to the writer : " The successful 
classes have used religion and heaven to keep 
the peace and to put off a lot of troublesome 
duties." 

But it is in the presentation and valuation of 
the determining causes of the present social un-

rest that the interest of this treatise lies. These 
are found in the practical working conceptions 
of the contract of labor and of the ownership 
of the agencies used by labor respectively en- 
tertained by the masters and the men. On 
the one side is the growing perception that the 
contract of labor is not unilateral in its obliga- 
tions but equilateral, and that the product of 
the combined effort of master and laborer, put 
back into the hands of the former in the shape 
of machinery, is a trust for society rather than 
a Trust for promotors : on the other is the re- 
luctance of 80 many potent agents in produc- 
tion to concede that " the old order changeth," 
and to recognize that restrictions on appren- 
tices merely parallel protective tariffs and pri- 
vate restrictions on output, and that unions 
are the reflex action of combinations. 

In the chapter entitled " Man and Society 
versus Machinery " the fight against the ma- 
chines is shown to be the inevitable result of 
social awakening and progress, and not in 
reality a fight against the machines but one for 
participation in their control. Either this con- 
trol must be shared or else they become a 
veritable car of Juggernaut before which the 
people perish. The chapter on " The Master 
Passion of Democracy," under the sub-titles 
of "illusions" and "realities," admirably pre- 
sents the limitations and the possibilities of 
the hoped-for equality. The former portion 
easily disposes of the Utopian theories, from 
Kousseau to Bellamy, which ignore the realities 
of human nature. 

" The origin of many of the most startling inequal- 
ities is biological. To get born with certain qualities 
is to have many chances to one against the man who 
came into life without them. We all see that the 
sources of superiority are in the gifts that cannot be 
made equal. The mysteries of temperment, buoyancy, 
vivid imagination, prudence, charms of personality, 
tact, inflexible purpose, steadiness of self-control, and 
even physical gifts, like good digestion and ability to 
sleep, are qualities that lead men beyond the average 
of their fellows. To put the least check upon these 
distinctions (or inequalities) would bring a common 
and a grievous loss." 

On the other hand : 

" Let us state again what is deepest in this un- 
abating purpose of the demos. It is not for absolute 
or external equalities. It is not for any equality that 
will submit to nice measurement. It is for far more 
equality than exists. It is for as much equality as each 
is capable of seizing and using to his own and others' 
good." 

Three consecutive chapters on "Socialism in 
the Making," " From Revolution to Reform," 
and " Socialism at Work " lead us on from 
the educational value of socialism as further- 



ing self-help to the admirable results already 
achieved in Belgium by " municipal trading." 
The writer has, prior to these chapters, called 
attention to the growing demand in this country 
for municipal ownership of public works and 
all public services, as a sign of the times which 
capital would do well to heed. If the choice 
is to continue to be between such one-interest 
management as has characterized the anthra- 
cite coal fields and public ownership, it is easy 
to believe that the working man's vote will 
bring in the latter. 

One of the most valuable features of the book 
is the frequent citation of capitalist opinion on 
the side of the thesis for equality and trusteeship 
which the writer maintains. Recognition that 
the trade union has come to stay and that it is 
far better for the masters to cooperate than to 
fight it is frequent. A growing sense of cor- 
porate and personal responsibility is one of the 
marked features of today, and Mr. Brooks 
gives it due credit. In this recognition, ex- 
tending to the union as the complemental force 
in social organization, he sees the escape from 
that ending most to be deprecated — the "so- 
cialism of the school." That he takes no 
idyllic view of the union the following indict- 
ment evidences: 

" The sin and the weakness of the trade union has 
been, in its attitude toward the non-union man ; in its 
sullen aversion to new inventions ; in its too willing as- 
sent to check the output of work ; in its tendency to 
discourage the best endeavor among the better and 
stronger workers ; in its too free use of the sympathe- 
tic strike ; in a far too reckless use of the boycott." 

And yet he says with as full conviction : 

" We have only to humiliate what is best in the 
aspirations of the trade union, and then every worst 
feature of socialism is fastened upon us. There is no 
danger in socialism that for a moment compares with 
that part of its working propaganda dear to the ex- 
tremists — the class struggle. To make men believe 
in the fatalities of this social warfare is the deadliest 
work in which any human being can engage. To make 
men disbelieve it, by organizing agencies through which 
the luminous proof appears that men can do their work 
together with good will rather than hatred in their 
hearts, is as noble a service as falls to us in this 
world." 

This last sentence is the keynote to the pur- 
pose of the man and of the book. The latter 
must be read throughout to appreciate its 
moderation, its charity, its broad inclusiveness, 
its close touch with both classes in the great 
industrial operation, its sensible suggestion of 
practical and immediate attempts to help to 
shape the social evolution.

The Diversions of a Biograpueb.* 



To the two volumes of " Studies of a Biogra- 
pher " issued in 1898 (reviewed in The Dial 
Vol. XXVI., pp. 46-8), Sir Leslie Stephen 
has added a second series of two volumes. We 
hope that many more will follow. No one who 
is familiar with the first series, or with any of 
Mr. Stephen's other works, — including of 
course his contributions to " The Dictionary 
of National Biography," — needs to be told 
of the charm of these pages. The studies are 
not, in most cases, biographies in the ordinary 
sense ; the first word of the title should receive 
the main stress. They embody the keen ana- 
lytical criticism of life and character of one 
who has long been engaged in the proper study 
of mankind, and who evidently desires to be 
writ down in the company of Abou Ben Ad- 
hem. Mr. St«phen is not blind to the foibles 
of the writers whom he discusses ; and on oc- 
casion he can wield a pen sufficiently sarcastic. 
Yet he never lets us forget his kindly spirit ; 
nor does he ever indulge in sarcasm for the 
pure pleasure of it. He is never iconoclastic ; 
nor does he let enthusiasm run away with him 
— unless it be " In Praise of Walking," and 
there we are in full sympathy with him, exult- 
ing in " the delightful sensation of indepen- 
dence and detachment," proud to belong to the 
noble company of those who get nearest to na- 
ture in a walking tour. In his criticism he has 
followed the via media. When his opinions dif- 
fer from those of others he expresses them with 
becoming — even at times extreme, but never 
assumed — modesty, and never dogmatically. 

As in the first volumes of these studies, the 
range of subjects is wide. Mr. Stephen has 
not, however, drawn upon the eighteenth cen- 
tury, the period which he has so fully illumin- 
ated in one of the greatest of his works ; he 
rarely discusses the poets as such. Though he 
talks of Donne, and Southey, and Milton, and 
Shakespeare, it is not so much of their poetry 
as of their views of life, of their politics, of 
their characters, that he chooses to speak to us. 
The ethical question involved in the publica- 
tion of the Browning love-letters interests him, 
as does the problem of the literary relations of 
France and England in the times of Voltaire 
and of Kousseau. 

In the matter of the Browning letters, Mr. 
Stephen is not disposed to be severe on the 
younger Mr. Browning for allowing their pub-

series. In two Tolnmes. New York : Q. P. Putnam's Sons. 



lication. Indeed, he adduces some very good 
arguments to demonstrate the beneficent re- 
sults of making public this revelation of the 
communion of two great souls. " The best 
books to read, as somebody has remarked upon 
such an occasion, are the books that ought never 
to have been written." The danger, he thinks, 
is that the publication of these letters is likely 
to set a precedent which will be abused ; " that 
the habit of turning out the most private recept- 
acles will be encouraged without reason by the 
success of this particular performance." The 
validity of this objection, however, is a point 
of casuistry which he confesses himself unequal 
to settling. 

The elusive Donne, whose life forms so cu- 
rious a psychological problem, naturally in- 
terests Mr. Stephen. How far the excessively 
frank poetry of his early years, " calculated to 
make Archbishop Abbot's hair stand on end," 
represents genuine autobiography ; how much 
of " Biathanatos " he himself really believed ; 
how " Donne, the wit, the poet, and the 
courtier, was sublimated into the saint, and a 
burning and shining light of the Church," — 
these are some of the problems with which he 
wrestles. The morbid constitution of Donne, 
he thinks, has a real affinity with latter-day 
pessimism. 

" People sometimes talk as if pessimism were a new 
inrention. It is merely a new way of saying the old 
things. The good old hearty belief in the devil had 
certainly one advantage: it enabled a gloomy person 
to cover his misanthropical sentiments by an edifying 
mask. The conviction that man's nature is corrapt, 
and that the great majority will be damned, enabled 
yoa to discharge your melancholy and yet ostensibly to 
believe that everything was for the best. Now that 
the deril has gone ont of fashion, the pessimist cannot 
find even a verbal excuse for his mismanagements of 
< Nature,' and has to appear in his true character." 

Mr. Stephen may not be a thorough-going op- 
timist ; but it is pretty clear that he does not 
belong to the opposite school. 

Another interesting study is concerned with 
Huxley. Nominally a review of Mr. Leonard 
Huxley's biography, this essay is an apprecia- 
tion of the great warrior for the truth, with an 
exposition of some points in his creed. That 
Huxley was a thoroughly religious man, there 
can be no longer any doubt ; indeed, it mast 
have surprised some readers of the biography 
that they could ever have believed otherwise. 
But bis creed was not milk for babes. His 
" hatred of shams meant the refusal of a brave 
man to shut his eyes, and scorn of men who 
deliberately provide convenient bandages for 
the purpose." Brought face to face with the 



286

[April 1, 



facts of human folly and human suffering, he 
refused to seek refuge in dreams or in an 
amiable and comfortable optimism. He had no 
faith in hasty panaceas. The cosmic process 
has been going on for ages. The ethical 
progress of society depends on combating this 
process ; and " the microcosm will have a long 
fight against the macrocosm." But in his 
home-life Huxley had felt the power of a sen- 
timent which " explained to him the meaning 
of ' sanctity ' and ' responsibility,' " and which 
without doubt formed " the source of the 
happiness and continued vigour which threw 
brightness over his career." 

" New Lights on Milton " is, in the main, 
an estimate of Professor Raleigh's book, which 
Mr. Stephen ranks high. Concerning Milton 
himself, while doing him full justice, Mr. 
Stephen has no illusions. Milton was as little 
as possible of a philosophic reasoner. He 
might have found a better way of escaping 
from the tyranny of Laud than " the accept- 
ance of the harshest Puritanic dogmatism." 
He was an idealist who was too often blind to 
the facts of experience. He generalizes from 
a single case — his own, — and is right only 
when his case happens to be typical. And 
there can be no adequate excuse for the scur- 
rility in which Milton indulged, and which 
" scandalized even his contemporaries." Mr. 
Stephen thinks the fierce indignation displayed 
in some of Milton's prose works might have 
been turned to better advantage. He discusses 
at some length, and with luminous effect, the 
difficulties encountered by Milton in expound- 
ing his theodicy in "Paradise Lost," and con- 
cludes that "we are forced to justify admiration 
at the cost of condoning palpable absurdities. 
It becomes evident that we must rather seek 
to justify ourselves by showing what a surpas- 
sing power was manifested in spite of innumer- 
able trammels imposed by the task and by the 
conditions of thought which made his concep- 
tion of it inevitable." 

The most interesting paper, however, is the 
one entitled " Shakespeare as a Man." In 
this Mr. Stephen goes into the old question 
of how much we know respecting the author 
himself of the great plays, — a question con- 
cerning which all possible shades of opinion 
have found expression, if not a skilled cham- 
pion. Mr. Stephen holds with Herr Brandes, 
that Shakespeare's spiritual history may be 
fairly induced from the plays and the poems, 
rather than with Mr. Lee, who inclines to 
mimimize the value of such inferences. It is 



interesting to compare this paper with the little 
monograph on " Shakespeare, the Man " which 
Professor Goldwin Smith published in 1900. 
Professor Smith concerned himself in part 
rather with certain facts regarding the exter- 
nals of the poet's life ; but to some extent the 
two papers overlap. Professor Smith insists 
upon the essential soundness of Shakespeare's 
morality. Shakespeare was a royalist, but not 
blind to the human side of the king ; in political 
and social sentiment a conservative — a hater 
of mobs and riots, but strongly sensible of the 
injustice in society ; sound but tolerant and 
liberal in his moral philosophy ; a conformist in 
religion, but more liberal than orthodox Ang- 
licans. With most of these propositions, we 
fancy Mr. Stephen agrees. He is certain that 
Shakespeare was not a Puritan ; yet the poet 
had " a profound sense of the mystery of the 
world and of the pettiness of the little lives 
that are rounded by a sleep." He believes 
Shakespeare to have been capable of Romeo's 
passion, though the sonnets are not neces- 
sarily descriptive of any real passion ; and 
likewise capable of the feelings and beliefs of 
the pessimist. Yet Shakespeare had no defi- 
nite ethical system to inculcate. He was con- 
tent to take the world as it is. Keenly alive 
to every enjoyment, he kept his head ; resisted 
temptation ; and never forgot that although 
the struggle fascinates, " when the energies 
decay the position which it has won loses its 
charm." In short, the poet was a marvellous 
blending of the passionate idealist with the 
man of the world, whose thorough delight in a 
seat in the chimney-corner in old age was not 
the least significant token of his wisdom. 

The other essays are hardly less interesting 
than those upon which we have touched. Criti- 
cism of this sort must be of the greatest use- 
fulness to the student of literature — and of 
life- Clark S. Northup. 



A New Book about Finland.* 



The recent efforts on the part of the govern- 
ment at St. Petersburg to Russianize Finland, 
to deprive the Duchy not only of its autonomy 
but of its nationality as well, have stimulated 
popular interest in the unfortunate Finnish peo- 
ple. As a result, much has of late been written 
about this somewhat remote comer of the 
world ; but most of it has been of a sentimental

and superficial order. The work before us, 
however, is of a different character. The au- 
thor has not written to satisfy a passing curi- 
osity : his attitude is that of an investigator, 
an explorer who has found an untravelled land. 
And the work he presents to us is such as only 
the scholar produces: it is a scientific state- 
ment of conditions and facts. 

In Professor Frederiksen's book, the life 
of the Finnish people is studied and presented 
almost wholly from the point of view of the 
economist. The opening chapter, on the settle- 
ment and early history of the Duchy, while in- 
teresting, is too brief and general to satisfy the 
student of history. The political scientist will 
object to the closing chapter on similar grounds. 
But he who cares for the results of economic 
research will find much in this volume that is 
useful and suggestive. The work is largely 
statistical : the author's purpose being to dis- 
cover and present the facts, he is somewhat re- 
luctant about drawing conclusions. 

For such a study. Professor Frederiksen is 
peculiarly well prepared. For a time he was 
Professor of Finance and Economics at the 
University of Copenhagen. Several years' resi- 
dence in the United States gave him an oppor- 
tunity to study industrial forces in the process 
of rapid development, and to learn a lesson in 
economic progress for which no other nation 
affords material. It should also be added that 
none but a Scandinavian can write intelligently 
on the subject chosen. Finland, both in its 
geology and in its civilization, is a continuation 
of the Scandinavian Peninsula. One-seventh of 
the population is Swedish ; and the Turanian 
Finns have, after many centuries of Swedish 
rule and civilizing influence, become largely 
Scandinavian in their manner of living and 
thinking. One who knows the rural problems 
of the Northern Kingdoms understands some- 
thing of the conditions prevailing across the 
border. It should be added, further, that prac- 
tically all the available information as to the 
social and economic state of this part of the 
■Czar's dominions is found in Swedish publica- 
tions. The work before us is that of a critic 
who both understands and sympathizes with the 
people of whom he writes. 

The problems discussed may be grouped into 
three classes : agrarian, industrial, and finan- 
cial. As the Finnish population is largely 
rural, agrarian conditions are discussed at con- 
siderable length. To the student of culture, 
such subjects as rural classes and land legis- 
lation are of great interest. Here mediaeval 



survivals and the creations of modem, even re- 
cent, times may be seen side by side. The 
peasant classes, while not so prosperous as the 
English or American farmers, are in every way 
superior to those of Southern Europe. There 
is much poverty among them, especially in the 
more remote districts, but nowhere as much as 
in the interior of Russia. The soil is none too 
fertile : much of the surface is swampy, or 
otherwise untillable ; the climate is harsh ; on 
the whole, the lot of the peasant is a hard one. 
The author sees considerable progress along the 
lines of agricultural methods ; but here again 
the old and the new are found side by side : im- 
plements of the most primitive sort and modern 
machinery are often used on the same estate. 

Finland is not rich in minerals ; consequently 
mining and allied industries are not of great 
importance. But the conditions for the devel- 
opment of certain other industrial pursuits are 
excellent. Manufacturing is making progress, 
especially such as stands close to agriculture 
and forestry. Most important are the cream- 
eries, the saw-mills, and the pulp factories. The 
textile industries stand next to these. 

Particularly interesting is the chapter on 
commerce and navigation. The recent progress 
of the country furnishes incontestable proof 
that Finland is undergoing rapid commercial 
development. The whole foreign trade, which 
in 1836 amounted to only eighteen millions of 
marks, had risen to a total of four hundred and 
sixty-eight millions in 1900. The commercial 
marine is of some importance, but shows little 
progress. Imports are somewhat in excess of 
exports. 

On the whole, the author seems satisfied that 
the people of Finland are rapidly learning to put 
to the best use all the resources that nature has 
bestowed on their land. Education is general ; 
agriculture and the industrial arts show a con- 
siderable advancement : trade is increasing, 
and the financial situation of the country is 
excellent. As to the Russianization of the 
people, which many have feared, the author 
says : " It has been well said, that the Finns, 
who for more than seven hundred years have 
not been made Swedish, during centuries when 
progress was much slower, and when the liberal 
character of the Swedish government did not 
provoke any great resistance, have no need to 
fear being Russianized." He does believe, 
however, that a close union with Russia in 
matters of commerce and finance would prove 
disastrous in many respects.

A Romance Ascribed to Milton.* 



In 1648 there was printed in London a prose 
romance of anonymous authorship written in 
Latin, and entitled " Novae Solymse Libri Sex." 
It fell unnoticed from the press, and unnoticed 
has it remained for two hundred and fifty 
years, until now in the fulness of time, under 
the pious and enthusiastic if somewhat effusive 
care of an English clergyman, the Reverend 
Walter Begley, it is again brought before the 
world, — butonly in an English translation, and 
loaded down with polemical and opinionative 
editorial annotation. 

The story is a simple one, and, stripped of its 
didactic inter-chapters, could be reprinted in 
a hundred pages. Two young Englishmen, 
Politian and Eugenius, brothers and students 
at Cambridge, run away from home and go 
upon their travels. In Italy they fall in with a 
talented and cultivated young Jew, Joseph, also 
upon his travels, but who has met with misad- 
venture. Him they befriend, and in his com- 
pany visit his native place, the New Jerusalem, 
now recovered and occupied by the race of 
converted Jews, During their long sojourn 
here, there is opportunity for interminable 
talk. The modern reader will sometimes be 
interested ; more often, I fear, however wide 
his interests, he will be bored. If he is de- 
voted to seventeenth-century theology, he may 
pull through. The talk is partly the relation 
of past adventures, — in part the antecedents 
or "argument" of the story, dealing, inter 
alia, with Sicilian banditti ; with the episode 
of Philander-Philippina, daughter of a Sicilian 
nobleman, who out of love for Joseph dis- 
guises herself as a man and follows him to the 
New Jerusalem, here being persecuted with the 
love of Antonia, a wanton widow, and finally

dying of disappointed affection ; with Theo- 
phrastus and his case of devil-possession ; with 
the story of ApoUos, Joseph's tutor, and his 
marvellous escape from pirates ; and with other 
things similar and dissimilar. Philander and 
Eugenius fall in love with the beauteous Anna, 
sister of Joseph, and become deadly rivals. In 
the end, their father arrives from England, 
grants them his forgiveness, and helps arrange 
their love-troubles, — this being rendered easy 
by the discovery of another sister, Joanna, 
equally beauteous. 

" Having thus obtained their father's consent, and 
arranged between themselves which sister they should each 
choose, they went to Jacob [father of Joseph and the 
sisters] and told their love. Politian asked for Anna, 
and Eugenius for Joanna, as their respective brides. 

" The.sisters were all this time quite unaware of what 
was being arranged ; but with their father's advice and 
their brother's persuasion, and the delicate and loving 
attention of the two really very good-looking young 
men, they were not long in yielding consent. They soon 
began to feel Love's ardent passion themselves, and 
burned with mutual fires."* 

The narrative ends with marriage bells. 

The story is but a framework and bait. The 
real thing is the didactic matter which accom- 
panies it. Some of it is interesting. The au- 
thor is evidently a man of high intelligence and 
high ideas. What he has to say on such sub- 
jects as Education (e.*/., vol. I., pp. 235 ff.), 
Poetry (I., 260 £f.), and Metaphysics (II., 9 ff.), 
and his ideas on Life and Conduct (I., 83, 87, 
90 ff., II., 96, 102 ff., 120 ff.),— these passages 
are all worth close attention. But the book as 
a whole cannot be called a great work. It is 
not so good as Sidney's "Arcadia," — but that, 
of course, is not primarily didactic. It is of 
sterner stuff than Lyly's " Euphues," — but 
that has the advantage of time and language 
and historical curiosity. 

It has pleased the editor and translator to 
attribute the work to Milton. It may be so. 
I have not yet seen any reason for believing 
that attribution impossible. But the positive 
arguments for Milton's authorship are to me 
singularly unconvincing. The gist of them 
seems to be given in the editor's wondering ex- 
clamation, " Who else in the period was capable 
of producing such a work ? " I do not know. 
I should want to search through my Fuller, 
my Aubrey, and my Cooper's " Athenae Can- 
tabrigienses," before indulging in much guess- 
ing. Perhaps Cowley, perhaps Sir Henry

Wotton (bat he died long before 1(548, and 
there would be other antecedent improbabili- 
ties), perhaps Phineas Fletcher ; hardly James 
Shirley : perhaps one of the Cambridge Pla- 
tonists, like More ; perhaps, as has been sug- 
gested, some learned Quaker of the age ; or, 
just possibly, some converted Hebrew living in 
England. But more likely it was none of these 
(there are strong objections to each), but some 
unnamed buried genius of unknown class and 
conditions. As in the case of the numerous 
Elizabethan plays of anonymous authorship, 
the probability is that the work was by no 
well-known hand, but is merely a gem from the 
dark unfathomed caves of ocean. From in- 
ternal evidence (in no point absolutely de- 
cisive), he was probably a schoolmaster, or at 
least an " educator," a Cambridge man, an ac- 
complished Latinist, a political idealist, but also 
something of a political conservative (cf. I., 
300, — I am not sure that this is Miltonic), a 
Puritan only in the moral sense, — hardly so 
politically, — and something of a metaphysician 
and theologian. 

The book as a whole shows none of Milton's 
architectonic power or of his skill as a literary 
craftsman. The editor thinks that it has the 
air of a belated college exercise, or that it dates 
from the Horton years. To tell the truth, one 
does not expect so much didacticism from the 
Milton of this period, — certainly not so much 
in connection with a creative and narrative 
theme like this. The Antocriticon, or Preface 
(II., 244 ; cf. I., 298 ff.) does not sound to 
me like Milton, nor does the passage on horse- 
manship (II., 1), nor that on suicide (II., 
17 — cf. Par. Lost, X, 998 ff.), nor various 
others. 

The question of the authorship of this work, 
or rather the question of its Miltonic author- 
ship is one of so much importance for literary 
history that one cannot but hope that some 
competent philologer or some budding Bentley 
will take it in hand and sift the evidence ac- 
cording to strict rule and method. As it is left 
here, it decidedly needs sifting. 

And now I shall have to say a word about 
this edition and its editor. His task has been 
a pions task, and one of large labor. With all 
its defects, he has conferred a service for which 
he deserves the gratitude of all students of 
seventeenth-century literature. He shows wide 
reading in remote and unknown authors. His 
translation is fluent and readable. But his 
book is badly planned ; his philological argu- 



ment is unmethodical, rambling, shifty, and 
perplexing, although hone«t and frank ; while 
his annotations, like those of the late Dr. 
Grosart, to whom this editor bears some re- 
semblance, are often irrelevant, cheap, thin, and 
intrusive. So that he has encumbered his text 
far more than he has elucidated it. I suspect 
him of being a Baconion (cf. II., IQn, 21, 342), 
— and we all know how the minds of those who 
believe that Bacon wrote Shakespeare are likely 
to work. Moreover, this publication is not com- 
plete as it stands. How well could we have 
spared, for the sake of a reprint of the original 
Latin text along with the translation, all of the 
editor's creeping and intrusive notes and ex- 
cursuses ! Again, in parts the translation is 
abridged without due notice to the reader 
(jR.g. II., 14 ff., 60, etc.). 

I find myself disagreeing with Mr. Begley'» 
argnments and methods in so many points that 
it is quite impossible to go into the matter in 
this space. Those who wish to test one or two 
of them are invited soberly and critically to 
inspect what they will find, for example, at voL 
L, pp. 58 bot. — 59 top (contrast the famous 
passage on books in Milton's '■'■ Areopagitica " ), 
ITlnl. 243n (compare Elyot, Mulcaster, etc, 
on Education), and vol. II., 14n2, 53n, and 
207n (the boomerang or semicircular argu- 
ment) , and 320 ff. (a whole series of arguments 
that need strict verification and careful re-con- 
sideration and evaluation). 

Finally, I may note in passing that one prose 
romance of the period, neglected by all literary 
historians, is also omitted from the editor's list 
of the very few English prose romances of the 
first half of the seventeenth century, and that 
is Thomas Gainsford's "Historic of Trebizond," 
1616. Gainsford's romance I hope before long 
to discuss more at length.

Mr. Edward Hrrrox is the author of a book on "Italj-

" For Tour soul's safety vou dare not look for Italy in

sonality upton this book, which gives zest to our reading, 
and makes us tolerant of views that should properly 
excite indignation. For he is at heart a reactionary, 
seeing only the sordid and vulgar aspects of the modem

Recent Fiction." 



After a considerable delay, owing both to the 
length of the work and the difficulty of translation, 
the English version of Zola's "V^rit^" has at last 
made its appearance. "Truth," it will be remem- 
bered, is the third of the four gospels according to 
Zola. " Fruitf ulness " and "Labor" were its pre- 
decessors in the series ; " Justice " was to have been 
its successor. The present work was barely com- 
pleted when the author made his abrupt and tragic 
exit from the stage of life, and the final work which 
was to have constituted the keystone of the arch 
was left unshaped. We are told that it would have 
dealt with the ideal of justice in a large way, with 
" social justice, equity as between class and class, 
man and man." Lacking that consummation of a 
noble undertaking, we must be contented to accept 
"\6ni6 " as the apotheosis of both truth and justice, 
for the work is consecrated to both these ideals in 
about equal measure. Its main theme is the Dreyfus 
affair transformed. The church is the subject of 
attack, not the army, and for this reason the abom- 
inable crime which affords the basis of the story is 
committed by an ecclesiastic instead of by an army 
officer. The scapegoat victim is a Jewish school-

warning, le clSricalisme, voilh I'ennemi. This 
mode of attack will give much offense to moderate 
souls, and is only to be justified as a legitimate 
polemic arising from the exigencies of a particular 
situation, and designed to further a specific artistic 
purpose. The book is very long and very repeti- 
tious, yet its earnestness and its noble idealism save 
it from becoming wearisome, and carry us through 
its six hundred pages without much deadening of 
our interest. In the deeply-felt preface with which 
Mr. Vizetelly introduces his translation, the author 
is spoken of as " Rousseau's foremost descendant," 
and his three gospels are said to occupy a place 
in the thought of to-day comparable to that occu- 
pied a hundred years ago by the three great works 
of Rousseau. This comparison is not altogether 
strained, for education and the constitution of so- 
ciety are the essential themes of both writers alike, 
and both bring to bear upon them an immense emo- 
tional force. Rousseau believed with all his soul 
that the regeneration of society must be brought 
about by a rationalization of the educational pro- 
cess, and this is the programme which is preached 
with prophetic fervor by Zola's " Y6rii6." One 
passage may be selected from the many of similar 
import to serve as an illustration. 

" The village was so small that Marc's doings could not at- 
tract much attention, and thus he was able to pursue his 
methods without any great interference. As a first step, he 
again got rid of all religious emblems, all pictures, copy 
books, and books in which the supernatural was shown tri- 
umphant, and in which war, massacre, and rapine appeared 
as ideals of power and beauty. He considered that it was a 
crime to poison a lad's brain with a belief in miracles, and to 
set brute force, assassination, and theft in the front rank as 
manly and patriotic duties. Such teaching could only pro- 
duce imbecile enertia, sudden criminal frenzy, iniquity, and 
wretchedness. Marc's dream, on the contrary, was to set pic- 
tures of work and peace before his pupils, to show sovereign 
reason ruling the world, justice establishing brotherliness 
among men, the ancient violence of warlike ages being con- 
demned, and giving place to agreement among all nations, in 
order that they might arrive at the greatest possible happi- 
ness. And having rid his class of the poisonous ferments of 
the past. Marc particularly instructed his pupils in civic mor- 
ality, striving to make each a citizen well informed about his 
country, and able to serve and love it, without setting it apart 
from the rest of mankind. Marc held that France ought no 
longer to dream of conquering the world by arms, but rather 
by the irresistible force of ideas, and by setting an example of 
so much freedom, truth, and equity that she would deliver 
all other countries and enjoy the glory of founding with them 
the great confederation of free and brotherly nations." 

We have thought more than once, while under 
the spell of Zola's superb conception of what a 
school can accomplish for its community, of Herr 
BjOrnson's treatment of the same theme in his 
great novel, " Flags are Flying in Town and 
Harbor," a work which will be remembered along 
with "V^rit^," among the forceful educational 
writings of our time long after the books have lost 
most of their interest as works of fiction. Just 
now, indeed, " V^rit^ " will find its chief interest 
for readers in its enforcement of the lessons that 
France has learned, and other nations as well, 
from the case of Alfred Dreyfus. Zola has ex-

pressed a fundamental trntb in his saying that 
'* one single act of injastiee may sa£Bce for a whole 
nation to be stricken with dementia and slowly die." 
Thonghtful Americans should find in this book a 
mnch-needed lesson for oar own country. Mr. 
Vizetelly says in his preface : " The world has 
known greater deeds of injustice than the Dreyfus 
ease, but never has it known — and may it nerer 
agMn know — such a widespread exhibition of 
mendacity, both so unscrupulous and so persevering, 
att«nded too by the most amazing credulity on the 
part of nine-tenths of the French nation." We are 
compelled to say in all soberness that a very fair 
ptarallel to this case is offered by our own treatment 
of the Philippine iniquities. There is the same empty 
declamation about the honor of the army, the same 
unscrupulous official mendacity, and the same de- 
termination to suppress the truth and pwrrert the 
ends of justice. Unfortunately, we have thus far 
found no champion of truth and justice to compel 
us to face the facts of the situation, and to force 
the moral revulsion in which is our only hope of 
national salvation. The nation that can condone 
the murder of a Father Augustine — to mention 
but a single instance — or remain unaroused by 
such a crime, is debarred from any condemnation 
of the treatment of Alfred Dreyfus by our sister 
republic, or from any participation in the sympa- 
thies to which " Y^rit^ " gives sach profound and 
forceful expression. 

Those readers who dislike sociological and relig- 
ious discussion in their fiction will find no cause to 
somplain of -'Lady Rose's Daughter." the latest 
novel by Mrs. Humphry Ward. It is a story with- 
out a touch of formal didacticism, and its charm is 
of a nature to disarm even such an irreconcilable 
as Mr. Andrew Lang. It is just a novel, and 
nothing more, a novel committed to no propaganda, 
and aiming at artistic effect alone. Its charm is 
not easy of analysis, for there is nothing partic- 
ularly striking in the types of character pre- 
sented, or in the invention of the plot. Such men 
and women figure in hundreds of current novels ; 
such relations as exist between them are the stock 
possession of writers of fiction. But the art is of 
a nature to compel our almost unqualified admira- 
tion, and we doubt if any other woman now living 
is capable of so subtle and sympathetic a series of 
studies in personality, of so unerring an artastae 
sense in every minute detail, or of such graceful, 
balanced, and, when the occasion requires it, im- 
passioned prose narrative. Certainly, this com- 
bination of qualities is most extraordinary, and. in 
the present instance, must be regarded as the fine 
flower of long years of a conscientious endeavor to 
attain perfection of workmanship. We feel safe 
in saying that no earlier book of Mrs. Ward's pre- 
sents us with so masterly an example of portraiture 
as is given us in her latest heroine, or pages of such 
grave beauty as those in which are set the Italian 
and Swiss scenes that come near the close of the 
novel. If in any respect she is relatively unsne- 



eessful. it is in the delineation of her men. A. 
wickedly disposed critic might describe the hero a» 
a '> blameless prig." and one could not defend him 
against the charge with complete success. Nor are- 
the other men who figure in the story as vitally 
realized as we might wish, for even Mrs. Ward 
cannot escape the natural limitations of her sex. 
The central situation about which the novel is con- 
structed has clearly been suggested by the eigh- 
teenth century model of Mme. Du Deffand and 
MUe. I'Espinasse. It is the direct transfer of his- 
tory to fiction to represent Lady Henry, old and 
blind, as employing Miss Le Breton for a reader and 
companion, to picture the brilliant salon sustained 
by the help of the younger woman, to describe the 
ensuing jealousy and inevitable mptore, and to set 
forth the residting aligaaMnt of the opposing force*. 
Bat Mrs. Ward hM Ampad the historical sugges- 
tion to her own modern purpoaes, and we Bhould b» 
simply thankful that the actual past has afforded 
her so happy an inspiration and example. 

" The Circle," by Mrs. Katherine Cecil Thurston^ 
is a novel upon the following text : *' In youth we 
dream that life is a straight line ; later we know it 
to be a circle in which the present presses on the 
future, the future on the past." The heroine is a 
girl of grenins, the daughter of a Russian Jew who 
has found a refuge in England and who dreams 
away his life in a musty cnrio shop in London. The 
capabilities of the girl are discovered by a woman 
of keen perceptions for the unusual in character and 
intellect, who persuades her to desert her humble 
home, and fit herself for a brilliant career. Several 
years pass, and when we next meet the heroine, she 
has become an emotional actress of Euroftean fame. 
In the height of ber success, she meets a man of 
strong character who wins her love, not knowing her 
real name or her public position. By an accident, 
he has become acquainted with the history of the 
actress, including her desertion of her childhood 
home, and, not dreaming that the woman he loves 
is the very person in question, tells her the whole 
story as an illostration of the worthleaaaeaB cl 
womankind. This makes explanation (JHHwilt, aad 
she continues to conceal her identity, although she 
had just been on the point of revealing it. It als» 
arouses her dormant conscience, and sends her back 
to the shop to make what atonement she may, and 
to comfort the last days of her aged father. The 
lover, filled with remorse when he discovers what he 
has done, seeks her out, and urges his claims with 
an ardor which eventually wins her for good. The 
leading situations are strained, and the difficulties 
to be overcome are mostly artificial, but the story 
is well-planned and straightforward, and makea an 
impression of originality and force. 

Mrs. Ella Higginson is favorably known to oar 
public as the author of some short stories and a 
volume of rather remarkable verse. She represents 
the far Northwest — the Paget Sound country — in 
our imaginative literature, and may almost be said 
to have annexed this region to the literary map. Her 



242 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



new novel, "Mariella; of Out-West," is her most 
ambitious undertaking thus far, and is a strong 
work of well-sustained interest. The heroine is a 
high-strung passionate girl, with an intense love for 
nature, whose social environment is of the most un- 
promising sort. We follow her career from child- 
hood to that fruition of a maiden's dreams that 
comes with realized love and the sweeping away of 
the obstacles in its path. For a long time her con- 
science stands in the way, for she deems herself 
pledged to the faithful but unlettered rustic whose 
doglike devotion has been offered her from her 
early school-days. This knot is finally cut by an 
act of sublime renunciation on his part, when he 
'learns that she has given her heart to another, and he 
persuades her to believe that his own affections have 
grown cold. In the delineation of Mariella's par- 
ents and of most of the other characters with whom 
her sensitive nature is brought into close association, 
we are provided with the sharpest of contrasts, and 
■no touch of meanness and vulgarity is spared. The 
-only thing that redeems this picture of sordid life 
is the genuine humor with which it is realized. In 
<this combination of a humorous insight into common 
life with the intense fundamental seriousness of the 
work we are irresistibly reminded of the power dis- 
played in "The Mill on the Floss." This sugges- 
tion may be taken for what it is worth ; it is not 
meant to imply anything more than that Mrs. Hig- 
ginson's book is distinctly out of the common. 

Another far Western story, the work of Mrs. 
■Fremont Older, is based upon Kearney's "sand- 
ilot" agitation of the San Francisco of the seven- 
•ties. Since that pestiferous demagogue could by no 
.possibility be made the hero of a romantic tale, the 
author has substituted for him a figure of her own 
-devising, one Paul Stryne of mysterious antece- 
■dents, who makes himself, by force of eloquence 
and sincerity, a leader of the laboring masses in 
■California, and comes near to effecting a political 
revolution. His relations with a woman, the daugh- 
ter of a local magnate, prove his downfall when suc- 
cess is just within his grasp, for they drag him into 
a duel which has the most disastrous results for 
his political fortunes. This story is called " The 
iSocialist and the Prince." Stryne is the socialist, 
and the Prince is his rival in the capricious affec- 
tions of the fair Theodosia. He seems to be a 
genuine Italian aristocrat, and yet he says " buona 
nuota," which is a suspicious circumstance. He 
certainly knows how to make love in truly Southern 
fashion, although his rival is not to be despised as a 
practitioner of the same art. The story is almost 
pure melodrama, but has a good deal of spirited 
action, and is not without historical value in its de- 
piction of the California of the past generation. 

Louisiana is the principal scene of "Veronica," a 
study of temperament by a new writer. Miss Martha 
W. Austin. It is a love story as far as it is a story 
at all, but little happens that is worth mentioning. 
Veronica is a young woman who has a great deal 
-of love to bestow upon somebody. At first she 



gives it to a friend of her youth, who proves utterly 
unworthy, then she fancies that she has transferred 
it to a casual acquaintance into whose society she is 
thrown during a Northern visit, but soon discovers 
that she has been mistaken. Finally, she lavishes 
it upon a youth whom accident has brought near 
her Lousiana home, but he is a consumptive, and 
dies just when the affections of the heroine seem to 
have found a lasting abiding place. So the story 
ends by saying : " And once more Veronica began 
her life." We hope that she did not make such a 
mess of the rest of it. There is a certain delicacy in 
style and characterization that saves the book from 
being as futile as it is inconclusive ; but it is ob- 
viously the work of an amateur, and would hardly 
be worth considering did it not hold out some 
promise of future performance. There are some 
curious slips indicative of ignorance or careless 
proof-reading, or both. There is no " Siegurd " in 
the Wagnerian music-drama, the hero of "Romola" 
is not " Melemma," Goethe never wrote of a " Land 
wo die Citronen blumen," and a man is certainly 
not an " anthropod." We are very curious to know 
by what mental process this last word was shaped. 
Why a man should say " most of us anthropods " 
is a dark mystery that we do not pretend to clear up. 
The ambitious purpose of the late Frank Norris 
to write " the epic of the wheat " in a series of three 
novels must now remain unfulfilled. The plan of 
this trilogy, it will be remembered, was to embrace 
the production of the world's chief food staple, its 
marketing in the great central city of America, and 
its consumption in some far-off region of Europe. 
The first of these pictures we had, in " The Octopus," 
and reviewed at the time of its appearance ; the 
second we now have, in " The Pit "; the third we 
shall never have, although we know that it was to 
be called "The Wolf," and may well believe that it 
offered to the novelist a finer opportunity than either 
of the other two. " The Pit " is called " a story of 
Chicago," but one must not hastily infer that the 
suggestion of the title is scriptural, for by it nothing 
more sinister or infernal is meant than the wheat- 
market, with its speculative fever and frenzied 
conflict. As far as the story has private interest, 
both central situation and moral are familar enough. 
Charles Dudley Warner's novels, and those of many 
other writers, have preached effectively upon the 
same text. But the author has arrived at something 
more than private interest, for he has sought to 
dramatize the clash of commercial arms and the 
shock of speculative battle, giving to the impersonal 
forces brought into play the principal share of our at- 
tention. We cannot say that the attempt has been 
altogether successful. In this respect " The Pit " 
seems less successful than " The Octopus " was, and 
it was only a very qualified praise that we were able 
to bestow upon that earlier work. Both books are 
strained, turgid, and unconvincing. The posthu- 
mous book, moreover, shows signs of hurried writ-, 
ing, and has evidently lacked the revision that the 
author would have given it had he lived.

THE DIAJ^ 



243 



Mr. Henry Kitchell Webster b another novelist 
who seeks bis themes in the strenaoos basiness life 
of today. His " Roger Drake, Captain of Industry " 
is a capital story of its kind ; the material is well 
ander control, and the plot is skilfully managed. It 
does not attempt to do so big a thing as is attempted 
in " The Pit," and it seems to as. in consequence of 
this restraint, the better novel of the two. But we 
are deeply suspicious of all these attempts to base 
works of fiction upon the money-making motive. 
Balzac did it successfully, because he was a genius 
of the first rank, but our recent American efforts 
in this direction seem to be little more than a 
sort of journalism, and none of them possess the 
elements of permanent interest 

We have had several good novels of the recon- 
struction period of late years, among which Mr. 
Page's ■• Red Rock '" is probably the best. By the 
side of that masterpeice we must now place " Ga- 
briel ToUiver," the most extended work of fiction 
that has been attempted by Mr. Joel Chandler 
Harris. The strength of this work is in its delin- 
eation of the types of character, black and white, 
that were to be found in rural Alabama in the sixties. 
Here Mr. Harris has for his only serious rival the 
late Colonel Johnston, and the two men have in 
«ommon the same eye for individual idiosyncrasies 
and the same sense of genial humor. The plot of 
" Gabriel Tolliver " is of the simplest kind. There 
is the love story of Gabriel and Nan, the arrest of 
Gabriel on a false charge supported by an unfortu- 
nate array of circumstantial evidence, his rescue by 
an ingenious device, and the eventual union with his 
sweetheart. There are numerous minor complica- 
tions, involving the other personalities concerned, and 
the total effect of the story is to give as an intimate 
picture of life in the country town where the action 
takes place. The problem of reconstruction is rep- 
resented by a carpet-bagger whose death we hardly 
regret, and the measures taken by the Knights of 
the White Camellia to persuade his deluded negro 
followers that they had better leave politics alone. 
The charm of this book is very evident, but it is the 
charm of a series of episodes and character sketches 
rather than of a narrative of continuous interest. 

" The Pride of Tellfair," by Mr. Elmore Elliott 
Peake. is a novel which depicts the life of a country 
town in Illinois with sympathy and fidelity. It is 
a story of strictly private interest, with a consider- 
able variety of characters, the minor types being 
drawn with almost as much care as those with whom 
the reader is chiefly concerned. So skilful and con- 
scientious a piece of work is not often met with in 
the harried production of to-day, and the result is 
surprisingly interesting, when we consider the un- 
promising nature of the material offered. Were 
there exhibited a little more of humorous detach- 
ment, we should be tempted to class the author with 
Mr. Howells, or at least to say that he was following 
close upon the footstepm of the older novelist. 

'• For a Maiden Brave," by Mr. Channcy C. 
Hotchkiss, is a romance of the American Revolu- 



tion, the scene being Long Island and New York, 
the time 1778. Although the story has this histor- 
ical background, its interest is essentially private, 
for it is chiefly concerned with a plot to dispoaaen 
the hero of an estate willed him by his uncle. The 
life of the hero is sought by the plotters, and, when 
they fancy they have disposed of him, the uncle be- 
comes their object of attack. It is needless to say 
that all these villainies are thwarted, and that a 
surprising series of adventures is contrived for both 
hero and heroine before they are ]>ermitted to reach 
a peaceful haven. The novel is neither better nor 
worse than fifty others of similar character that we 
have read during the past few years. 

In taking up " Calvert of Strathore " we turn 
from the American to the French Revolution, and 
the two upheavals are brought into close relation- 
ship by the American characters who chiefly figure 
in the story. Jefferson and Morris play important 
parts, for the scene opens with the early days of 
1789, when Jefferson is still at his poet as Minister 
of the Confederation, and just before the formal 
inauguration of the new United States government. 
A young friend of the minister, after being gradu- 
ated from Princeton, comes to Paris to serve him 
as a confidential secretary, and the romance is thus 
supplied with a hero. This youth, whose name is 
the title of the book, has an engaging personality, 
and falls in love with an aristocratic French maiden 
who at first rebuffs him, and finally saccumbs. The 
story carries us on through the days of the States 
General and Legislative Assembly down to the death 
of the Swiss guards, and presents the history of this 
period in epitome. The history is no doubt excel- 
lent, but there is too much of it, and the private 
romantic interest for which alone such a story as 
this exists is fairly swamped. We leave the hero 
and the heroine just as they are starting to make a 
new home in Virginia. 

The book with which we close the present review 
is a story of contemporary history, being concerned 
with oar relations to the Pacific islands which the 
nation claims by the questionable rights of purchase 
and conquest It is called " Loyal Traitors," and 
is the work of Mr. Raymond L. Bridgman. It ia 
an appeal, in the form of fiction, to our national 
conscience, and is intended to open blind or averted 
eyes to the hypocritical and otherwise un-American 
policy which we are now pursuing toward the hap- 
less inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago. Such 
appeals are mach needed, and will continue to be 
made by men who are jealous for the fair fame of 
our coantry, for the question at issue is too moment- 
ous to be lost sight of, or to lapse into the limbo of 
indifference. Like the question of slavery, which in 
its fundamental aspects it so much resembles, it will 
never be settled until it is settled in accordance with 
the principles upon which our true national great- 
ness is founded. As long as we continue te govern 
an alien people without their consent, and to with- 
hold from them the basic guaranties of individual 
liberty which were won for us by our own ancestors at

so great a cost, there will be voices raised in protest 
against so indefensible a course, and against the evil 
counsellors who have committed us to it for the time 
being. Mr. Bridgman's voice has the ringing quality 
that comes from absolute conviction of the justice 
of his cause, and his work is an effective tract in 
the propaganda of anti-imperialism. Unfortunately, 
it is not a work of imaginative art, and is conse- 
quently not of a nature to repeat the moral success 
of "Uncle Tom's Cabip." Moreover, the author 
has taken a course calculated to alienate from his 
cause many wavering sympathies. His hero is an 
American who not only speaks and writes in behalf 
of the Filipinos, but who actually joins them in 
arms against his own country. This may be severely 
logical, but it implies a misdirection of zeal. He 
furthermore weakens his case by dragging in the 
war in South Africa, which offers no parallel at all 
to our war in the Philippines. It is quite possible 
to justify the course of England in Africa without 
in any way palliating the conduct of the United 
States government toward the unfortunate people 
whom we have subjugated. Consequently, in spite 
of our sympathy with Mr. Bridgman's purpose, and 
our belief in the justice of the cause for which he 
pleads, we cannot help regarding this book as an ill- 
considered production, and one that cannot alto- 
gether be counted upon to further the righting of our 
great national wrong.

Briefs on New Books. 



A new phase of the modern exploit- 

fhTJiid'w!?! ^''""^ "* *^® experiences of the pio- 
neers upon our western frontier, is 
presented in "The Story of the Trapper" (Apple- 
ton), by Miss A. C. Laut. This author is already 
favorably known by her dashing romantic novel, 
"The Lords of the North." In that narrative, the 
warp of a fictitious plot was skilfully interwoven 
with the woof of the history of the struggles and the 
contests, often armed, between rival fur-companies, 
for supremacy in the fur-bearing regions of western 
North America ; and the weaving was so skilful as 
to embarrass the reader who should endeavor to 
distinguish fact from fancy. For that reason, 
doubtless, many readers have been unwilling to 
credit that romance with any basis of historic truth. 
In "The Story of the Trapper" many of the start- 
ling incidents of the novel appear among the cold 
facts of the fur-hunter's life. We are here furnished 
a brief sketch of the rival efforts of fur companies 
to control the rich trade of the far West, and their 
alternative triumphs and defeats, accompanied by 
graphic descriptions of the toils, hardships, and suf- 
ferings of individual trappers and classes or bands 
of trappers. The wildest forms of strenuous life 
for civilized men, or for men who have once been 
civilized, are here portrayed. The devices adopted, 



the dangers encountered, the difficulties met and 
surmounted, the lonely, mystical, and sometimes 
mysterious life, the rich prizes often secured, and the 
prices paid therefor in illness, in anguish, and occa- 
sionally in loss of life itself ; all these which furnish 
the burden of many a romantic novel, are here 
coolly set down as the simple facts of daily life, and 
in number sufficient to furnish the basis for count- 
less romances. Apparently, the author has turned 
over to the public the abundant riches of a well- 
filled portfolio of border sketches. The white- 
trapper followed hard upon the footsteps of th& 
aboriginal Indian, preceding the pioneer explorer 
often by many years. The picture of the trapper's 
toils and troubles is therefore a distinctive picture, 
and one whose outlines, if not preserved now, would 
soon have been lost forever. It seems scarcely 
credible that a woman should be able to fill in such 
a picture from her own personal sketches ; yet Miss 
Laut claims to have been so far a part of the wild 
existence she portrays, as to be able to speak of her 
own knowledge as to much that she narrates, and to 
have had the opportunity on the very ground to dis- 
cover the truth as to much which she learned from 
tradition. Whosoever would know of the acute- 
perils of the bear hunt and of encounter with a 
pack of hungry wolves, of the mode of life of the 
beaver, the musk-rat, and other aquatic animals,, 
of the thieving propensities of wolverine, coyote, 
and wild-cat, and of all the minutiae which go to 
fill up the daily round of the frontier trapper and 
help him swell the proceeds of his athletic and 
engrossing vocation, will find the account here given,, 
though often disconnected, always deeply inter- 
esting. 

Liieraiure in ".The Reaction in France," first pub- 

France after lished in 1874, is the third section of 

the Revolution. » jj^;^ Currents in Nineteenth Cen- 
tury Literature," by Dr. Georg Brandes. It now 
appears as a volume of the English translation of thi» 
great work (Macmillan). The reaction concerned 
is, of course, from the radicalism and subversive 
temper of the Revolution, and is typified by such 
men as Chateaubriand and Joseph de Maistre. 
After the introductory historical chapters on the 
Revolution, the Concordat, and the principle of 
authority, the author states his main thesis in these 
terms : 

" By sounding here and sounding; there, and every-vrheTO 
coming upon the same fundamental thought, we have dis- 
covered what was the ruling idea of the new period. It may 
be called by many names. It is the great principle of ex- 
ternality, as opposed to that of inward, personal feeling and 
private investigation ; it is the great principle of theocracy, of 
the sovereignty of Qod, as opposed to the sovereignty of the 
people ; it is the principle of authority and power, as opposed 
to the principle of liberty, of human rights, and of human in- 
terdependence. And when we examine the life of the day in 
all its various developments, we everywhere find the same 
watchword and the same white flag. The fundamental idea 
sets its mark upon everything." 

This volume, then, is a study of the rise of the prin- 
ciple of authority from the ruins of the Revolution,

of its growing ascendency and temporary suprenn- 
acy, of its disintegration and final downfall. This 
is clearly one of the most distinctly defined acts in the 
drama of modern intellectaal development. Hav- 
ing cleared his ground by a historical survey, Dr. 
Brandes devotes the central section of his book to 
special studies of Chateaubriand, de Maistre, Bonald, 
Madame de Kriidener, and the earlier phases of 
Lamartine and Hugo. Then follows a chapter on 
" Love in the Literature of the Period," with illus- 
trations from Chateaubriand, Madame de KiUdener, 
and Lamartine, and the work closes with three 
chapters on the dissolution of the principle of au- 
thority in both the theoretical and the practical 
spheres, and the collapse of the reaction under 
the influence of such men as Lamennais, Courier, 
B^ranger, and the later Hugo. The spirit of ro- 
manticism was stirring in the French intellect, and 
the principle that had held sway for a generation 
had lost its power to repress the natural reason and 
imagination. This volume is one of the most deeply 
interesting of the entire series to which it belongs, 
and displays to the best advantage that large out- 
look upon life and thought which is characteristic 
of the author, and which has earned for him his 
distinguished place among European critics. 

Quincy, Ma4,., ^ free-handed and gossippy recital of 
andUt/amotu the local history, family traditions, 
group o/patrioit. anecdotes, and memorabilia of a well- 
known Massachusetts town (Quincy) makes up the 
content of a creditable volume at the hands of Mr. 
Daniel Munro Wilson, entitled " Where American 
Independence Began " (Houghton). This title is 
ill-advised and misleading; its place would have 
been better filled by the sub-title, " Quincy : Its 
Famous Group of Patriots, their Deeds, Homes, and 
Descendants." The author suggests, and appears 
to insist, that American independence was born in 
Braintree (from which town Quincy was afterward 
set off), with the birth of John Adams, in 1737. 
But this boast does not come with the authority of 
John Adams himself, and probably never would 
have had his countenance ; for he himself declared, 
as Mr. Wilson does not omit to recite, that " the 
child Independence was born " in 1761, with the 
argument of James Otis in opposition to the Writs 
of Assistance. But in spite of this extravagant 
claim, the book is, happily, most readable and enter- 
taining. The genealogies of the great families which 
have been reared and have flourished in this favored 
town receive extended and deserved attention. The 
lives and careers of the Adamses and Quincys and 
Hancocks are traced for generations, and the por- 
traits of successive members of these remarkable 
families adorn the pages of the narrative, inter- 
spersed with views of buildings, monuments, and 
ecenery. Biographical sketches of the three great 
diplomats of as many generations of one family — 
John, John Quincy, and Charles Francis Adams — 
add substantial value to the story ; and there is a 
Quincy genealogy, exhibiting the six successive 



Josiah Quincys, and embellished with the portraits 
of demure damsels in several generations, each 
named " Dorothy Q." The singular fact is noted 
in these pages, that while in most great families the 
descent is from sire to son, in this exceptional family 
the descent has been from 'Siah to 'Slab. Time has 
not operated to excuse the sons of this Massachu- 
setts town from public service, and tha narrative 
illustrates the prominence and the conspicuous work 
of the Adamses and Hoars and Quincys who are 
our contemporaries. The friendly and sympathetic 
spirit which brightens every page shows that the 
preservation and publication of these Ana has been 
a labor of love with the author. 



Mont Peiie and Although several books on the same 
the tragedy of absorbing topic have preceded Pro- 
Martiniqve. fessor Angelo Heilprin's "Mont 

Pel^e and the Tragedy of Mariinque" (Lippin- 
cott), none of them has had the benefit of the same 
study and preparation that have gone to the mak- 
ing of this large and handsome work. The author 
reached the unhappy island on the 25th of May 
last, — two weeks and a half after the catastrophe, 
— and found, instead of the beautiful tropical 
island of the books, " a withered piece of the earth 
that seemed to be just emerging from chaos." He 
remained, with a brief intermission, until Septem- 
ber was well begun, engaged in investigation and 
exploration, the numerous photographs he took 
forming the illustrations for the present volume. 
The mystery of this dire tragedy lies largely in the 
wave of destruction that swept down from the vol- 
cano upon the people of St. Pierre on the 8th 
of May, leaving but two survivors out of the thou- 
sands who were in its course. In this wave, which 
was seen from points of vantage and scientific ob- 
servatories as " a great black cloud " issuing from 
the mountain and rolling down its slopes into the 
sea, there were " light detonations " observed, bat 
no flame until its passage over the city had set the 
buildings afire. It was of force sufficient to wrest 
the strongest edifices of St. Pierre from their 
foundations, and leave them, iron- work and all, 
mere crumbled ruins ; yet long clay pipes were 
found hanging where they had been exposed for sale 
without damage. It burned the bodies of some of 
those it overwhelmed, stripped others of their 
clothing, and still left a bird's plumage intact and 
paper packages of food uncharred. One of the 
survivors was Augnste Ciparis, who was at the time 
in the city jail. " He was waiting for the usual 
breakfast on the 8th," Professor Heilprin records, 
" when it suddenly grew dark, and immediately 
afterwards hot air, laden with ash, entered his 
room through the door-grating. It came gently 
but fiercely. His flesh was instantly burned, and 
he jumped about in agony, vainly calling for help. 
The heat that scorched him was intense, but lasted 
for an instant only, and during that time be almost 
ceased to breathe. There was no accompanying 
smoke, no noise of any kind, and no odor to sug-

gest a burning gas. The hot air and ash were the 
working demons that tore his flesh. Ciparis was 
clad at that time in hat, shirt, and trousers, but his 
clothing did not take fire ; yet beneath his shirt his 
back was terribly burned." The book is interesting 
throughout, and written in a vivid and picturesque 
style that retains a not unpleasant exotic flavor 
through the occasional use of foreign idiom.

Scotland, gives us, in " The Great 
Marquess" (imported by Scribner), a full and 
painstaking account of the life and times, not of 
Montrose, as one might expect from the main 
title, but of his contemporary and rival, Argyll, 
whom the author ably champions as having superior 
claims to this designation. With Scott's " Legend 
of Montrose " in the other scale-pan, this learned 
but not equally fascinating work will hardly tip the 
balance in favor of Argyll as a popular hero, 
though the book is one that was well worth writing, 
no life of the man, outside of histories and bio- 
graphical dictionaries, having before appeared. No 
attempt is made to settle the disputed derivation of 
the clan name, Campbell ; but the commonly re- 
ceived date of Argyll's birth, 1598, is by fairly con- 
clusive evidence shown to be wrong, and that event 
placed nine years later. If it be true, however, 
that the boy accompanied his father in 1615, when 
the last desperate uprising of the Clandonalds was 
put down, the earlier date would seem more prob- 
able. But this matter is not mentioned. The really 
Socratic calm and cheerfulness with which Argyll 
faced his execution at the end, makes the reader 
very willing to style him a great, if not the Great, 
Marquess. The book has seven portraits, abundant 
footnotes, an appendix, and an eight-page index. 

The romance ^^^ Southeastern province of France 

and beauty is full of the romance of the Middle 

of Provence. ^g^g Frowning old castles and 

rugged rocky hillsides tell tales of surpassing in- 
terest to the historian. Mr. Thomas A. Janvier 
has familiarized himself with many of the thrilling 
events of the past and with the quaint and homely 
customs of to-day in this province of sunshine, and 
has put them in an attractive form under the title 
"Christmas Kalends of Provence" (Harper), 
though this title covers but one of the three parts 
of the book. The cutting of the yule-log and its 
conveyance to the home, the long festive days and 
evenings of Christmas week, and the simplicity of 
the stories told on these occasions, give us a peep 
into the beautiful neighborhood and home-life of 
those simple folk. "A Feast-Day on the Rhone" 
and " The Com^die Fran^aise at Orange " are the 
other two parts of the work. The first gives us a 
glimpse of a biennial pilgrimage to the F^librige 
and the Cigaliers, and the queer experiences which 
charmed the pilgrims at every turn on the way ; 
and in the second part we catch a view of the 
Roman theatre of fifteen centuries ago at Orange, 



Tht title of 
" The Lark 
once more. 



and follow at a distance its checkered and trag- 
ical career. As it is to-day, it is the most perfect 
Roman theatre in existence, outranking the much 
better known edifice at Pompeii. Mr. Janvier puts 
color into his pictures, and fixes on our minds scenes 
of rare beauty and romance. 

Few periodicals as short-lived as 
" The Lark" will be remembered 
BO long and so pleasantly. " The 
Lark " was issued for the fun of it ; it typified 
the play-principles in literature. And because 
it represented the over-flowing exuberance of 
youth " talking right on," we listened, caught by a 
new note, familiar enough in theory but too little 
practiced among us staid Anglo-Saxons, who culti- 
vate no art but literature and take that very ser- 
iously indeed. This note of "The Lark " dominates 
Mr. Gelett Burgess's recently published volume of 
essays, " The Romance of the Commonplace" (Elder 
& Shepard). Some of the essays, indeed, were first 
published in that periodical ; others were written 
for " The Queen," a London magazine ; but all are 
alike in their convincingly optimistic attitude to- 
ward every-day life, and all are interesting be- 
cause that attitude seems so genuine. Mr. Burgess 
evidently understands " The Use of Fools," and 
knows by experience the joy of " The Deserted 
Island," which is a new sort of Spanish castle. 
For him, correspondence is a delightful game, and 
" Dining Out " a real diversion. He does not 
wish to trifle with life, but he sees no harm in en- 
joying it, sportsmanlike, as he goes along. Only, 
one must take an active part in the game, not be a 
mere spectator. " We are here not be entertained, 
but to entertain ourselves," Mr. Burgess tells us. 
His enthusiasm is contagious, and his suggestions 
about glorifying the commonplace are very refresh- 
ing, if scarcely vital enough to be inspiring. 

"Telepathic" or "Can Telepathy Explain ? " is the 
"epiruttaiistio" query raised by Mr. Minot J. Savage 
occult theories. j^ ^ gmall volume recently issued by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. The problem dis- 
cussed is whether the alleged facts of the occult 
type are better explained by the " telepathic " or 
by the " spiritualistic " theory. Mr. Savage de- 
cides in favor of the latter. The volume, brief as 
it is, is a sad piece of reading. It furnishes need- 
lessly plain evidence that the temperament and 
training of the author, and his appreciation of the 
evidential value of fact, are all so inadequate and 
distorted as to result in a presentation that would 
be ridiculous were it not deplorable. Such writings 
do no end of harm, because they get referred to and 
respected by persons who are looking about for well- 
known names to bolster personal prejudices. They 
do no good ; for they merely confuse the questions 
they are intended to illuminate. As soon as the 
requirements that are necessary for one to record 
a valuable opinion upon such subjects are more gen- 
erally understood, the appearance of such books as 
this will become happily rare.

Notes, 



A new novel br Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard, en- 
titled " For the Sake of his Company : A Tale of the 
Misty Citv," will be published at once by Mr. A. M. 
Robertson of San Francisco. 

The passing out of copyright of " Elsie Venner " is 
signalized by the appearance of a new and cheaper 
edition of that famous noveL In its present form it is 
one of the " Cambridge Classics " of Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 

An additional Spring announeement of Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co., is a volume entitled " Life in a New 
England Town, 1787 — 1788," being the diary of John 
Quincy Adams while a student in the office of Theo- 
ptulos Parsons at Xewbnryport, edited by Mr. Charles 
Francis Adams. 

Mr. J. M. Dent is making as complete a collection of 
the letters of Charles Lamb as possible for publication, 
and will be grateful to collectors in America who will 
allow him to have transcripts of their possessions made 
and forwarded. Communications may be addressed to 
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., 29 and 30 Bedford St, 
Convent Garden, London. 

An exhibition of rare and choice books in fine bind- 
ings, of interest to every lover and collector of fine 
books, will be held by Messrs. Charles Seribner's Sons 
at the Anditorium, Chicago, during the afternoon of 
each day from the 2nd to the 8th of this month. Ex- 
amples will be shown of the work of all the best-known 
American, English, and French binders. 

The following books not previously inclnded in the 
Spring announcements of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. will be published by them this season : " The 
Correspondence between Ralph Waldo Emerson and 
Herman Grimm," edited by Mr. Frederick W. Holis; 
" The Confiscation of John Chandler's Estate," by Mr. 
Andrew M. Davis ; and " Of Education," by Mr. R. R. 
Bowker. 

"A Midsommer Nights Dreame " is the first volume 
in the " First Folio" Shakespeare, edited by Miss Char- 
lotte Porter and Miss Helen A. Clarke, and published 
by the Messrs. Crowell. This edition will be in as 
many volumes as there are plays, and follows the folio 
of 1623 in text, spelling, and punctuation. Each volume 
has an introdaction, copious notes, variorum readings, 
a glossary, and an anthology of " selected criticism." 
Recent publications of the American Book Co. in- 
clude the following: "A Laboratory Manual of Phy- 
sics," by Messrs. Henry C. Cheston, Philip R. Dean, 
and Charles E. Timmermann ; " Botany All the Year 
Round," by Mr. E. F. Andrews ; "Language Lessons," 
by Mr. .J. W. Sewell ; "Commercial German," by Mr. 
Arnold Kutner ; and "A School Grammar of the Eng- 
lish Language," by W. M. Baskerville and J. W. Sewell. 
HThe recent death of Gaston Pans lends a melan- 
choly interest to the little volume on " Medivsval 
French Literature," just published as a " Temple 
Primer " (Macmillan). Considering its source, we need 
hardly emphasize the fact that this brief treatment of 
a great subject is absolutely masterly from the point of 
view of the scholar, and itself the best of good litera- 
ture from the point of view of those who are concerned 
with such matters as style and manner of presentation. 
".\ contribution of vital importance to current discus- 
sion of the negro problem mav be expected in Prof. 
W. E. Bnrghardt Du Bois' " The SouU of Black Folk," 



to be issued this month by Messrs. A. C. MeClurg & Co. 
In theae easays, the author, himself a negro, has en- 
deavored to " show the strange meaning of being black 
here in the dawning of the Twentieth Centnry." He 
makes an eloquent plea for right and justice to his 
people — ^for the spiritual uplifting of the negro as well 
as for his material advancement.

Kent Fort Manor 

By William Henry Babcock, author of " The Tower of Wye." (Griffin Series.) 
Illustrated by W. Sherman Potts. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

The scene of Mr. Babcock's new novel is laid in the Chesapeake Bay, and several of 
the chief characters are descendants of the William Claiborne who figures in his former book, 
but the time is that of the Civil War. There is a curious psychological problem of iitiherited 
memory involved in the plot which is sure to attract attention and interest. 

''The interest of this weird novel centres around a hypothesis tentatively broached by 
the author that there is such a thing as heredity of memory." — Pittsburg Dispatch. 

The Archierey of Samara 

A Russian novel, by Henry Iliowizi, author of " The Weird Orient," " In the 
Pale," etc. (Griffin Series.) Illustrated by Stephen J. Ferris. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.00. 

This is a thrilling story of some very interesting phases of Russian life by one who knows 
his subject thoroughly, having been born and passed his early years in the Russian province 
of which he writes. It will be found of absorbing interest and of much sociological value. 

" A romance, yet it is a great deal more than that. It is history, philosophy, and 
romance combined." — Philadelphia Record. 

" A powerful protest and an effective story." — Philadelphia Press.

This volume conuins the story of " Ole Mistis," which has attained a wide celebrity 
from its use bv professional readers and reciters, and which first brought the author into 
notice ; together with " Gray Gamma," " Miss Kitty's Funeral," and a number of others in 
Mr. Moore's inimitable vein of mingled pathos and humor. The illustrations are noubly 
excellent. 

" A Summer Hymnal " is selling with gathering popularity, and the many readers who 
have been charmed by it will want this book also. 

" Will probably renew the success of ' A Summer Hymnal.* The stories arc most 
effective, and the humor is of a first-rate order." — Philadelphia Press.

A Summer Hymnal a Romance of Tennessee 

By 

JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE 

Illustrated by Stanley M. Arthurs. 12mo, cloth extra, $1.25. 

Marion Harland savs : " For we have in the ' Hymnal ' one of the most exquisite 
pastorals of American life ever written. It is an Idyll — a 'Reverie,' than which nothing 
more charming has been offered to our reading public since Ik Marvel founded a school of 
his own fiftv one vears ago. . . . Our 'United Country ' is proud of the State that has given 
us within a dozen vears Charles Egbert Ciaddock and this later and gentler painter of Ten- 
nessee life." 

" There is in the philosophy of this novel something deliciously sweet and comforting. 
... A book of this sort occasionally is a delight and an inspiration." — Louisville Times. 

"Mr. Moore displays more sentiment than does Mr. Allen, and a shrewder philosophy."

TffE TWO LOST YEARS. 

There has been mach confusion of aim and 
playing at cross-purposes in the educational 
discussions of recent years, yet a few fairly 
definite principles may be found to emerge 
from all this expression of varied and fre- 
quently ill-considered opinion. Upon no other 
point, perhaps, has there been such general 
agreement as upon the assertion that in our 
American scheme of public education there is 
a sum of wasted or misdirected energy which 
amounts to the work of about two years. In 
other words, the time which we take in trans- 
forming the raw material of childhood into the 
finished product, if it may be so styled, which 
is turned out from the colleges and the pro- 
fessional schools is about two years longer than 
it ou»ht to be under conditions of economical 
management. In most of the European sys- 
tems, results substantially equivalent to our own 
are produced in much less time, and the grad- 
uate is ready to enter upon the work of his life 
at an appreciably earlier age. Now two years 
of waste in educational work is a serious mat- 
ter, and the question of avoiding so great a loss 
is one of the most important that confronts our 
educational workers. We may well defer the 
settlement of minor problems until we have 
united upon some method of attacking this 
major problem of the two lost years. 

tVe have no doubt whatever that the greater 
part of this loss falls within the period of ele- 
mentary education. That period ends with us 
at the average age of fourteen or fifteen, and 
it should end two years earlier. Most of our 
systems allow eight years for this preliminary 
school work (not including the kindergarten in 
the reckoning), when seven years would be 
ample, and six within the bounds of possibility 
under conditions of intelligent instruction and 
favoring home influences. That neither of 
these conditions exists to any general extent is 
a fact widely acknowledged and deplored. The 
quality of our elementary teaching leaves much 
to be desired, and is fairly put to shame when 
compared with the similar grade of teaching in 
France or Germany. An additional element of 
waste is found in the unscientific programmes 
of our elementary schools, with their frequent 



262 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



experimental intrusion of doubtful matter, and 
their lack of suitable coordination. That the 
home does not work in sympathy with the 
school is also a fact too evident to require proof. 
The average parent of the public school child 
«faows a shocking lack of responsibility in this 
'matter. The whole burden is left for the 
:school to bear, when it ought to be largely 
shared by the home. The influence of the 
parent is often directly antagonistic to educa- 
tional advancement, for it makes a vice of in- 
dulgence, and encourages the child in all sorts 
of outside interests at the direct expense of 
his educational weal. 

These facts are so generally admitted by ed- 
ucators that it would be unnecessary to bring 
them forward for restatement were it not for 
a surprising recent development in educational 
opinion. Until very recently, it has been taken 
for granted that the remedy for all this waste 
was to be found in strengthening the work of 
the early years, in organizing instruction upon 
a more scientific basis, and in developing the 
sense of responsibility in the parent. The waste 
and the remedy have been equally evident, and 
it has seemed that the only thing to do was to 
do away with the one by applying the other. 
But, whether impatient of a reform that must 
inevitably require many years for its accom- 
plishment, or actuated by a desire to win the 
unthinking applause of the multitude, certain 
persons high in authority have of late been 
seeking to persuade us that we had better save 
the lost years at the upper end of the educa- 
tional scale, and give up the hope of a really 
pedagogical treatment of the difficulty. A col- 
lege course of two years, leading to the custom- 
ary bachelor's degree, is what has been actually 
recommended for our consideration by the presi- 
dent of one of our great universities. By this 
surgical short cut we are to deal with a disease 
which calls for patient scientific treatment, 
while we are leaving the old malignant forces 
fitill at work in the organism. 

We are certainly not opposed to measures of 
rational economy undertaken with respect to 
any part of the scholastic programme. The up- 
per reaches of the educational scheme may have 
their defects as well as the lower ones. As far 
as this is found to be true, suitable remedies 
should be sought and applied. We are in sym- 
pathy with those higher institutions that en- 
courage the exceptional student to perform in 
three years the work that busies the average 
student for four. We are even in sympathy 



with the present marked tendency to permit the 
last year of collegiate work to stand also for the 
first year of professional training. But we are 
distinctly opposed to any plan for making the 
college degree less difficult of attainment than 
it now is, or for shortening the traditional 
period of the American college course. The 
bachelor's degree means little enough under ex- 
isting conditions, except for the few determined 
students who by their own zeal for learning 
make it mean what it should, and even were 
there no way of saving time and energy before 
the college is reached, it would still be an un- 
worthy concession to the spirit of commercial- 
ism to award that degree any more readily than 
it is now awarded. It is not so serious a matter 
as all that to give our young men what is curi- 
ously called their "start in life" a year or two 
earlier than it is given them under existing con- 
ditions. 

Aside from this wholly inadequate reason for 
cheapening our higher education, the advocates 
of a college course of three or two years seem 
to find their main reliance in the argument that 
college entrance requirements are now more dif- 
ficult than they were a generation ago, and that 
consequently the sophomore of to-day is as much 
of a scholar as his father was when a senior; 
that the end of two years of college life now 
marks about the same average of attainment as 
was then marked by the ceremony of gradua- 
tion. We are not altogether sure of this, but 
admitting it for the moment, we would remark 
parenthetically that by going back half a 
dozen generations we may discover a strenuous 
condition of college scholarship that puts our 
best present achievements to shame. Cotton 
Mather, graduated from Harvard College at 
fifteen, offers an example of what education 
could then accomplish ; we cannot match that 
record in our own times, not even by the 
college career of John Fiske. We may not 
care for the type of learning which those old 
Puritan students achieved, but we cannot deny 
the solidity of their parts. 

If it be indeed true that the graduate of the 
last generation was no better educated than is 
the sophomore of to-day, it means nothing 
more than that we have recovered, by a pain- 
ful process of gradual advancement, some- 
thing of the educational seriousness of an age 
long past. And now that we have in a cer- 
tain measure overcome the laxity which reigned 
in the methods and the demands of our fathers, 
are we suddenly to give up all that has been

thus won for the sake of lengthening by a 
year or two the gainful period of life ? Is the 
active life, under the conditions of this fever- 
ish modern world, so much more important 
than the contemplative life that we should 
make such a sacrifice ? It seems to us that 
to state these questions squarely is to answer 
them in the negative, and that it should rather 
be our watchword to strengthen and enrich 
as fully as we may the years which are al- 
ready consecrated to education, but not to 
abate by a single jot the demands which we 
are now enabled to make of the college grad- 
uate. We are glad to note that the sugges- 
tions recently made with a view to curtailment 
(or rather decapitation) of the college course 
have met with a general chorus of disapproval 
and that the wisely conservative opinion seems 
still to prevail among our most influential edu- 
cators. 

There is one rather marked recent tendency 
in the treatment of collegiate education 
which we believe to be praiseworthy. The ten- 
dency to connect more closely the work of the 
colleges with that of the secondary schools ; 
even transferring to the latter the first year or 
two of the training hitherto reserved for the 
former, is a movement which is commended 
by important practical considerations, and 
which does not impair the present achieved 
ideal of scholarship. We are glad to note 
the increasing development of academic insti- 
tutions which cover the first two years of col- 
lege, and the extension in the same direction 
of the work of our larger high-schools. The 
essential thing about college work is its char- 
acter and spirit ; the place where it is done is 
of minor importance. 

There is no doubt a certain sentimental 
value in the traditional plan of a continuous 
four years' course in the same college ; the 
resulting ties and associations are not to be 
despised. But the plan which makes it possible 
for students to get half way through college 
without leaving home means the possibility of 
the higher education for thousands who other- 
wise would not get it at all, and this is a con- 
sideration which must be held to outweigh the 
other. In the homely phrase, half a loaf is 
better than no bread, and many of those who 
by such means get the first half will contrive 
to get the other half as well. The institution, 
whether public or private, which is engaged in 
performing this service deserves the most cor- 
dial encouragement, and we look forward to 



the time when every large city in the United 
States will accept among its recognized duties 
that of providing at public cost an education 
roughly equivalent to that of the German 
Gymnasiun^ With such an enlargement of 
the functions of our public secondary schools, 
and with the establishment where most needed 
of private foundations, similar in scope, our 
colleges will everywhere be given a new im- 
pulse, and their membership will be recruited 
in ever increasing numbers. They will by no 
means abandon their own provisions for the 
first years of college work, but the present 
disparity in the numbers of their lower and 
upper classes will disappear, and possibly be- 
come reversed in the favor of the latter. We 
believe that this will be the next great step 
taken in the development of the work of higher 
education in the United States. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE ORIGIN OF "BLIZZARD." 
( To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In the " Virginia Literary Museum " for 1829, will 
be found the following: " Blizzard. ' A violent blow — ' 
perhaps from Blilz, [Germl lightning. Kentucky" 
(i. 418). In 1834 Davy Crockett wrote: "I started 
down the edge of the river low grounds, giving out the 
pursuit of my elks, and hadn't g^ne hardly any distance 
at all, before I saw two more bucks, very large fellows 
too. I took a blizzard at one of them, and up he tumbled. 
The other ran off a few jumps and stop'd ; and stood 
there till I loaded again, and fired at him " ("Narrative," 
p. 152). In 1835 Crockett again used the word (in 
his " Tour," p. 16), but in a sense which was misunder- 
stood by Bartlet and which has proved a puzzle to lex- 
icographers. An examination of the entire passage 
(too long to give here) and a comparison with the ex- 
tract just quoted, show that in 1835 the word was em- 
ployed figuratively as meaning a sort of extinguisher, 
a " squelcher." No instance of blizzard has been re- 
corded between 1835 and 1880, but the word is said to 
have appeared in its now familiar sense in a Dakota 
newspaper in 1867. Professor Cleveland Abbe calls 
my attention to the first use of the word in the "Monthly 
Weather Review" for December, 1876, as follows: 
"The very severe storms known in local parlance as 
' blizzards ' were reported on the 8th as prevailing in 
Iowa and Wisconsin, where temperatures of -15° and 
-20° prevailed, with violent northwest winds and 
much drifting snow " (p. 424). It may be added that 
in the sixties and seventies of the last century what we 
now call blizzards were on the plains termed northers — 
a word which apparently originated in Texas, where, 
(as applied to a north wind) it is found as early as 1838. 

Can any of your readers furnish me with examples 
of blizzard, in any sense, previous to 1880?

A QUEKN OF Letter-Writers.* 

Mrs. Basil Montagu once Ikid to Mrs. 
Carlyle, "Jane, everybody is born with a vo- 
cation, and yours is to write little notes." A 
fresh instalment of these piquant little letters 
— hardly inferior in general interest, and not 
at all inferior in style, to those already selected 
and published as the cream of her correspond- 
ence, — will be warmly welcomed by all Mrs. 
Carlyle's admirers. 

No one can read these volumes without being 
tempted to paraphrase a late eminent states- 
man and declare that Froude never put pen to 
paper without subtracting from the sum of 
human knowledge. A long and illuminating 
introduction by Sir James Crichton-Browne 
gives a psychological analysis of that extraor- 
dinary editor's method of unerring inaccuracy 
in treating the Carlyles' domestic relations. 
Froude is shown to have been the victim of pre- 
conceived ideas. Having made one false as- 
sertion, he felt himself bound to support it by 
another equally false, and so on to greater and 
greater perversions of the truth. Carlyle had 
used the word remorse in speaking of his feel- 
ing for his deceased wife. Mordant sorrow — 
and, by the way, both Chapman and Dryden 
use the term in this sense — was what the 
bereaved husband meant ; but Froude chose 
to interpret the word as bitter self-reproach. 
Jlinc illcB lacrimm. 

The Carlyles' early life at Craigenputtock 
has been depicted by Froude as one of the lone- 
liest and dreariest imaginable ; but the young 
wife's letters written then and there falsify this 
view almost as effectively as if penned for the 
purpose. By Froude's own confession, he knew 
practically nothing of her life there. He says, 
mistakenly, that few of her letters of the period 
were preserved, and that consequently " we are 
left pretty much to guess her condition ; and of 
guesses, the fewer that are ventured the better." 
Yet he has hazarded a good many guesses, and 
how bad they were was shown by the publi- 
cation of Mrs. Carlyle's " Early Letters " in 
1889. The editor of this third collection of 
her letters points out these and many other 
instances of " Froudacity," some of them so

wantonly mischievous, if not malicious, as to 
stagger belief. For instance, introducing the 
letters of July, 1843, Froude published the 
following to support his charge of selfishness 
against Carlyle : " The house in Cheyne Row 
requiring paint and other readjustments, 
Carlyle had gone on a visit to Wales, leaving 
his Wife to endure the confusion and super- 
intend the workmen, alone with her maid." 
And all the time he had in his keeping letters 
proving the falsity of such assertions. Both 
Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle had been invited to visit 
the Redwoods, in Wales, but for reasons of her 
own Mrs. Carlyle declined. Carlyle urged her 
to accompany him on this Welsh tour. Failing 
in this, he next proposed to take a furnished 
cottage near Nottingham, in which they should 
spend the month of August together. To the 
letter proposing this Mrs. Carlyle replies : 
" Never mind me. Dearest ; try to get the most 
good of the Country that can be got for your- 
self ; I do not care a farthing for Country air ; 
and am busier here than I could be anywhere 
else. Besides I should like to go to Liverpool 
when my Uncle returns home." These words 
were suppressed by Froude in publishing the 
letter of which they form a part. The truth of 
the matter is, Mrs. Carlyle had set her heart on 
decorating her house a little that summer, and 
therefore managed to get her husband out of 
the way for this very purpose. So one might 
go on citing instances of both the suppressio 
veri and the suggestio falsi; omission, mis- 
quoting, and wrong dating being the expedients 
commonly adopted. 

But let us turn to something pleasanter and 
more profitable. Mrs. Carlyle's vein is already 
familiar to the reading public, and she is as 
bright and entertaining here as in the earlier- 
published correspondence. The first of the 
letters now offered is dated nine years earlier 
than the first letter of " Letters and Memo- 
rials," the last only a few months before the 
writer's death, and all, with some half-dozen 
exceptions, now see the light for the first time. 
The greater number are to her husband. Kins- 
folk and a few intimate friends claim the rest. 
One letter of the Craigenputtock period is es- 
pecially significant in view of Froude's picture 
of Mrs. Carlyle's dreary existence at that time. 
Visiting her mother at Templand in 1828, the 
young wife writes back : 

" Kindest and dearest of Husbands — Are you think- 
ing you are never to see my sweet face any more? . . . 
What progress you will have been making with Burns 
in my absence! I wish I were back to see it; and to

give TOO a kiss for everj minute I have been absent. 
Bat Tou will not miss me so terriblj as I did too. 
Dearest, I do lore voa! Is it not a proof of this that 
I am wearjing to be back to Craigenputtoek even as U 
tlandt, and while ererrone here is trring to make mj 
stay agreeable to me ! . . . God bless jou, darling. 
You will send the horses for me on Sunday, und nidiU 
widtr dawm ! Ever, ever your true wife." 

In the sammer of 1837 she went on a tour 
of pleasure with Mr. and Mrs. Sterling. This 
is what she writes to her husband about nature: 

" Every day I felt more emphatically that Xature 
was an intolerable bore. Do not misconstrue me, — 
genuioe, unsophisticated Xatnre, I grant you, is all 
very amiable and hannleas; but beautiful Xatore, which 
man has exploited, as a Reviewer does a work of ge- 
nius, making it a peg to bang his own conceits upon, to 
enact his Triumpk der Ewqtjmdaamkxii in, — beanttfnl 
Nature, which yon Xock. oak npon from pea-gieen 
arbonre, which you dawdle about in on the backs of 
donkeys, and where you are haunted with an everlast- 
ing smell of roast meat — all that I do declare to be 
the greatest of bores, and I would rather spend my 
days amidst acknowledged brick houses and pared 
streets, than in such a fools' paradise." 

Two pen portraits, or rather caricatures, of 
James Martineau are amusing. In the second 
the editor allows only the initials to appear, 
but the place and date (Liverpool, 1846) help 
to make the reference unmistakable. 

** He is anything but happy, I am sure : a more 
eonoentrated expression of melancholy I never saw in a 
hnman face. I fancy him to be the victim of consci- 
eoee, which is the next thing to being the victim of 
green tea! His heart and intellect both protest against 
this bondage; and so he is a man divided against him- 
self. I should like to convert him — mot.' If he could 
be reduced into a wholesome state of spontaneous black- 
guardism for six months, be would ■ come out very 
strong.' But he feels that there is no credit in being 
(spiritually) joUy in his present immaculate condition, 
and so he is as sad as any sinner of us all." 

" I went to hear J — M — yesterday morning, as a 
compromise betwixt going to the Family Cbarch and 
cansiBg a Family disturbance by staying at home. The 
sennon was ' no go.' The poor man had got something 
to say which be did not believe, and could not conceal 
the difficulty he found io eonformmg. Flo irets of rhetoric 
world without end, to cover over the barrenness of the 
soil! I felt quite mae tor him; he looked such a pictnre 
of conscientioaa aapuah while be was overlaying his 
Christ with similes and metaphors, that people might 
not see what a wooden puppet he had made of him to 
himself, — in great need of getting flung overboard 
after the Virgin Mary, ' Madame sa Mfere.' " 

Even daring the melancholy and tryins 
period of Mrs. Carlyle's morbid despondency 
(1846—57) her letters maintain their wonted 
sprightly flow of amusing chit-chat. Once and 
again, perhaps, we catch a glimpse of the dark 
undercurrent, as when she says in a letter to 
her brother-in-law, Dr. John Carlyle : 

" My cold is away again; but, oh, dear! my ' interior' 
is always very miserable; and nothing that I do or for- 



bear seems to make the least difference. The worst is 
the dreadfol pressure on my faculties. There are kinds 
of illneases that one can work under, but this sort of 
thing that I go on with makes everything next to im- 
possible for me." 

In a few days, however, her pen is running on 
again as usual, with an amusing reference to 
a letter addressed to " Mrs. T. Carlyle, Esq." 
Her little phrases of endearment to her husband 
are always beautiful and touching. Such a pair 
of married lovers, thinks the reader, one knows 
not the like of ; and the little harshnesses of 
daily intercourse fall back into their true in- 
significance in the light of these letters. Be- 
fore company, and even in private, the dour 
Scotch nature is confessedly given to express- 
ing its conjugal affection in negatives. What 
but love and sjrmpathy could have dictated such 
a passage as the following, which opens a letter 
written by the wife to her husband after thirty- 
four years of married life ? 

" I do hate. Dear, to tell all about myself every Day! 
as if I were ' the crops,' or something of that sort. 
When ■ I'se no better, I'se ashamed to say it '; and when 
I am better I'se equally ashamed to be cackling aboat 
my welloeaMs; and so I shall be glad when yon can see 
with yoor own eyes how I am instead of my telling yoa 
in words." 

The letter closes with a " God be with you ! 
Ever yours." Finally, in a letter written only 
a year before her death, excusing herself for 
letting a day pass without sending the usual 
token of affection to her absent husband, she 
says : 

" Again yon have had no Letter, Dear! But, in 
compensation, all the ink-spots are out of yonr writing- 
table! Had it been going strai^t to any Literary 
Museum, I shouldn't have meddled with the mi, 
which Hero-worshippers might have regarded with a 
certain adoration; but for your oicn use I thought yoo 
would like it better clean! It has never been cleaned, 
that poor table, sbwe I aaed to do all the Housework 
myself ! And it is a wonder of heaven that I should be 
up to such work again, after all; and I cannot better 
express my thankfulness than in working while I may! 
So I fastened on the table after breakfast this morn- 
ing, and rubbed at it the wk<^ time till the eaniage 
came at two! Of course Jegaie eonld haTe waxed aad 
torpentined the table better than I; but no one but me, 
I flatter myself, could have shown the patience and in- 
genuity neeeasary for extracting all that ink! " 

A tboasand pities it is that Mrs. Carlyle's 
entire correspondence — forming, as annotated 
by a husband's loving hand, a most charming 
and impressive work of literature — could not 
have been entrusted at the outset to the sym- 
pathy and discretion of the present editor, who 
has done his work so wisely and so well. We 
should then have been spared all those incred- 
ible twistings of the truth that make one gasp

lent example is Warton's " History of English 
Poetry," a book which was so well made more 
than a hundred years ago that it still holds its 
own, in spite of the great advances in English 
scholarship and criticism since Thomas War- 
ton's time. Of the large subject treated with 
learning, with judgment, and with style, no 
book in English surpasses Green's " Short 
History of the English People." 

The first impression that is left on reading 
Mr. Einstein's account of " The Italian Ren- 
aissance in England," — an impression that is 
but deepened by a more careful examination 
of the book, — is, that the subject is entirely 
too large for a thesis. Any graduate student is 
bound to come to grief with a subject that 
comprehends two centuries of time and two 
great literatures. To cope with so vast a 
theme there is required, first of all, a full man, 
one who has read widely at first hand. And 
then to sufficiency of equipment there should 
be added critical acumen and a sense of the 
relative value of things. It is the play of 
Hamlet with Hamlet left out, to discuss the 
Italian Renaissance in England, crowding the 
whole of the great drama within the space of 
three pages. So the Italianization of Shakes- 
peare gets here but three pages more.

Einstein. (Columbia University Studies in Comparative Lite- 
rature. ) New York : The Macmillan Co. 



In addition to immaturity, Mr. Einstein 
labors under the further disadvantage of not 
being to the manner born in either of the lit- 
eratures he is writing about. The external 
point of view is curiously marked. The 
discussion of English poetry is timid, dry, and 
wholly inadequate ; while there is absolutely 
nothing in the treatment of English politics 
which would suggest that the Tudors had some- 
thing to do with the development of the mod- 
ern state. Machiavelli and Elizabeth to the 
contrary, the English Constitution is as con- 
spicuously absent from Mr. Einstein's book as 
the Elizabethan drama. On the other hand, the 
chapter on the Italian merchant in England 
is written con amore. 

The plentiful dearth of humor in these 

pages, if it is not foreign, suggests at least the 

Baker's perplexity : 

" I said it in Hebrew, — I said it in Dutch, — 
I said it in Qerman and Qreek ; 
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) 
That English is what you speak t " 

No man of English strain, and no Italian, could 
possibly have walked through these two cen- 
turies of grandly humorous literature without 
even once cracking a smile. There is one bit 
of unconscious humor, where the fear of bri- 
gands and the inconveniences of travel are na- 
ively urged to explain the fact that the Eliza- 
bethan travellers in Italy made no account of 
the landscape. The English traveller affords a 
good illustration of the author's heavy manner 
of treating an attractive theme. Almost every 
Englishman of note during the reigns of Eliza- 
beth and James made the tour to Italy. They 
were statesmen, diplomatists, poets, artists, 
scholars, men of fashion and of leisure. The 
literature of the time is full of their experiences 
and of the ideas they brought home on all 
sorts of subjects. But the great body of this 
literature (which often bubbles over with fun) 
is a closed book to Mr. Einstein, who confines 
his attention to two or three early guide books. 
He quotes Dallington's " Method for Travel," 
but does not mention Fynes Moryson, nor 
Lithgow, nor Coryate. He knows Sidney as 
a traveller, but not Crashaw, Donne, Haring- 
ton. Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Howell, Killi- 
grew, Milton, Peacham, Thomas Sackville, 
Sir Henry Wotton, and literally scores of fa- 
mous Elizabethans. 

Mr. Einstein has fallen into a good many 
errors of fact and of opinion. Names of per- 
sons are frequently inaccurate. For example, 
William Latimer (p. 38) is introduced (p. 30) 



1903.]

and indexed (p. 416) as Thomas Latimer ; 
William Selling (p. 29) should be William 
Tilley, of Selling ; Cardinal Guala (Guala 
Bicchieri, raised to the purple by Innocent 
III.) is called Cardinal Gualli (p. 179), where 
it is said, in obscure and now obsolete English, 
that he " conferred Chesterton Rectory to the 
monastery of St. Andrews." Lord Buckhurst is 
spoken of (p. 275) and indexed (p. 412) by his 
title, one of his titles, only ; his name, Thomas 
Sackville, nowhere appears. " Even a woman 
miniaturist, Alice Carmellian " (p. 196) is not 
recognized as Ellis Carmyan, mentioned on 
page 77, as a masque decorator. The " Dic- 
tionary of National Biography " records this 
person's name as Alice, or Ellis, Carmylyon, 
and gives five variant spellings, — Alice Car- 
millian, Alys Carmyllion, Alis Carmylion, Ellis 
Carmyan, and Elysys the painter. As to Alice 
Carmylyon's being a miniaturist, the " Dic- 
tionary " says : " It does not appear what 
foundation John Gough Nichols has for his 
remark that ' she appears to have been a painter 
in miniature.' " Upon the point of sex, the 
same authority decides that there is " no con- 
clusive evidence either way." 

A variation in kind from the confusion of a 
person with himself, or herself, is Mr. Einstein's 
making two different persons masquerade as 
one. On page 352 Unico Aretino is supposed 
to be Pietro Aretino. This is confounding the 
fairly respectable, if rather conceited, Unico 
with the eminently unrespectable Pietro. Ber- 
nardo Accolti, of Arezzo, was called the " Unico 
Aretino," from his " unique " faculty for ex- 
temporizing verse. Pietro Aretino's name was 
Pietro Bacci. These two persons did live at 
the same time, and in the same city. But 
Francesco Patrizi, Bishop of Gaeta (died 1494) 
comes to life again (p. 293) as Francesco 
Patrizi (1529-1597), and no bishop. Fran- 
oeaco Patrizi, Bishop of Gaeta, wrote " De 
Regno et Hegis Institutione" (Paris, 1567), 
a book which was translated by Richard Rob- 
inson, in 1576, as "A Moral Methode of Civile 
Policie," etc. The other Francesco Patrizi 
wrote, "Delia Ilistoria diece dialoghi . . . 7je' 
quali si ragiona di tutte le cose ajjpartinenti 
air historioy et alio scriverla, et alU osservarla " 
( Venetia, 1560). Thomas Blundeville trans- 
lated this book, in 1574, under the title, " The 
true order and Methode of wryting and read- 
ing Hystories according to the Precepts of 
Francisco Patricio," etc. Mr. Einstein men- 
tions the first work on pages 293 and 301 : the 
other work is the one referred to on pages 309 



and 313. But on page 417 all the references 
are assigned to one person, F. Patrizi. 

Again, it fills the judicious reader with mis- 
givings to meet with many familiar titles which 
have been here transformed, and deformed. 
The Latin title just cited reads (p. 293) " Be 
Regno et Regio Institutione." George Pettie's 
alliterative title " A Petite Pallace of Pettie 
his Pleasure," becomes unintelligible (p. 364) 
in " Pettie's Palace of Pettie his Pleasure." 
A well-known book Mr. Einstein knows as 
J. R. Green's " Short History of England " 
(p. 292). 

The most extraordinary made-up title occurs 
on page 362, where Mr. Einstein, writing on 
Italian fiction, produces a little fiction of his 
own. He says : ^^Perimides and Philomela, 
for instance, was so closely imitated from 
Boccaccio that it [?] amounted almost to a 
translation " ; and as authority for this state- 
ment, the " Publications of the Modern Lan- 
guage Association " (1898, p. 250) is alleged. 
Turning to the " Publications " for 1895, 
(" Elizabethan Translations from the Italian "), 
on page 275 there is entered Robert Greene's 
" Perimides the Blacke-Smith "; and a few 
pages farther on (p. 278), "Philomela, the Lady 
Fitzwaters Nightingale." On page 250, in the 
preface to this article, which is on prose ro- 
mances from the Italian, Greene's imitation of 
Boccaccio is mentioned, and these romances 
are instanced as examples. Mr. Einstein has 
run the two titles into one, and then given a 
reference that is wrong as to source, year, and 
paging. Can Mr. Einstein have read the novels 
of Robert Greene ? 

It would seem to imply an almost hopeless 
inaccuracy of mind as to titles, to have to note 
of Mr. Einstein that the work which has helped 
him most in writing his book, the "Publication* 
of the Modern Language Association," he calls 
everywhere (he cites it four times only) the 
" Proceedings " of that society. The " Pro- 
ceedings " is the report of the annual meeting 
of the Association, published every year ia 
No. 4 of the " Publications." No one of Mr. 
Einstein's four references will be found in any 
of the *' Proceedings." 

It is not the case, as stated on page 81. that 
Giovanni della Casa's " Galatheo " was trans- 
lated into French and Spanish before its ap- 
pearance in English, in 1596. Robert Peter- 
son's translation of "Galatheo " was printed in 
London, in 1576, with a dedication to the Earl 
of Leicester. The British Museum prossesses a 
copy of this imprint ; and an exemplar, imper-

feet in some respects, is owned in this country 
by Harvard University. The first French trans- 
lation, that of Jean du Peyrat (Paris, 1662) 
did precede Peterson's ; but the first Spanish 
translation, a very rare book, is dated nine 
years later. It is, " Tratado llamado Galatheo 
. . . Traduzido de lengua Toscana en Castel- 
lano por el Doctor Domingo de Bezerra " 
(^Venecia, 1685). 

A familiar Cellini story turns up (p. 196), 
attributed to Torrigiano, whose " irascible tem- 
perament," it is said, " did not long permit 
him to enjoy quiet among ' those beasts the 
English,' as he was wont to call them." There 
is a hasty reading here of J. A. Gotch (" Early 
Renaissance Architecture in England," p. 7). 
Gotch attributes this characterization of the 
English correctly to Cellini, and quotes it ac- 
curately, " beasts of English," quelle bestie di 
quelli inghilesi ('■'■ Vita di Benvenuto Cellini" 
c. 15. b.). 

Mr. Einstein's habit of inaccuracy passes 
over into matters of opinion. He says (p. 364) 
that John Drout's " The Pityfull Historic of 
two louing Italians Gualfrido and Barnardo le 
vayne " was " falsely stated to be a translation 
to mislead the reader." The " Dictionary of 
National Biography," under Drout's name, 
says : " Collier doubts whether Drout really 
translated the story from the Italian, and sug- 
gests that Drout describes it as a translation 
80 that he might take advantage of the popu- 
larity of Italian novels." Mr. Einstein gives 
no authority for his statement. If he has 
based it upon Collier, it has but a shaky found- 
ation, for surely a doubt and a suggestion of 
John Payne Collier do not make a matter of 
fact. The point is important because it illus- 
trates the curious facility of conjectures to get 
taken for facts by the next writer on the sub- 
ject. 

Mr. Einstein himself is rather given to con- 
jectures, as when (p. 74) he says that Saviolo 
on quarrels, or "perhaps some similar sentence 
. . . first suggested the dramatic possibilities 
of Romeo and Jidiet" — " Romeo and Juliet," 
of all tragedies, with its venerable antiquity 
and distinguished pedigree, in Latin, and even 
in Greek, Italian, French, Spanish, and En- 
glish. Or when (p. 168), repeating R. L. 
Douglas (Introduction to " Certain Tragical 
Discourses of Bandello," Tudor Translations, 
1898, p. xlvii), he says that Ascham, in cen- 
suring English translations of Italian books, 
" had probably in mind Fenton's translation 
of Bandello, dedicated to Lady Mary Sidney." 



As a matter of fact, Fenton translated thir- 
teen novels only, and all of those from the 
French of Belleforest. If Roger Ascham had 
any one book in mind, it was much more likely 
to have been Painter's " Palace of Pleasure." 
This is evident from the interpolation at the 
end of the first part of " The Scholemaster," 
which, from internal evidence, must have been 
written about 1568, the year after the ap- 
pearance of Painter's Second Tome. At that 
time. Painter had published ninety-four nov- 
els, largely from the Italian. Volume I., 
sixty novels, is practically a Boccaccio book ; 
Volume II., thirty-four novels, a Bandello 
book. 

The index leaves much to be desired. Very 
few titles get into it at all, and a large majority 
of persons are indexed without their Christian 
names or initials. This leads to the confusion 
of persons, even by the author himself. Names 
in the foot-notes now and then stray into the 
index, but most of them are omitted. Many 
of the foot-notes are inaccurate. The refer- 
ences at the bottom of page 92 are cited as 
from " Castiglione " ; they refer in fact to 
Thomas Hoby's translation of Castiglione, 
"The Book of the Courtier" (probably the 
"Tudor Translations" reprint, 1900). Mrs. 
T. R. Green (pp. 258 and 259) should read 
Mrs. J. R. Green. Richard Mulcaster's " The 
First Part of the Elementarie" is cited (p. 164) 
simply " Elementary," without author's name, 
without date, without the original spelling. So 
vague a reference is useless. 

Many of the mistakes in this book arise, 
doubtless, from the author's youth and haste. 
They might have been avoided by sounder know- 
ledge and closer attention to details. A very 
serious fault has been noticed by the London 
" Athenaeum." The English reviewer points 
out, that in the making of his book Mr. Ein- 
stein has been indebted, more than his own 
statement of the case would seem to indicate, 
to an earlier work, " Elizabethan Translations 
from the Italian." The facts referred to 
by " The Athenaeum " are these : There ap- 
peared in the " Publications of the Modern 
Language Association," 1895-1899, four arti- 
cles on "Elizabethan Translations from the 
Italian." Of the 187 Printed Sources of in- 
formation set forth in Mr. Einstein's biblio- 
graphy, 106, or more than half, are to be found 
in the " Elizabethan Translations from the 
Italian." There can be no doubt about Mr. 
Einstein's having found them there, for he 
uses material from the " Elizabethan Transla- 



1903.]

tions from the Italian " in his text and foot- 
notes more than 100 times. No fewer than 64 
works for the first time collected and annotated 
in '• Elizabethan Translations from the Italian " 
are qnoted in Mr. Einstein's footnotes without 
reference to the source of authority. Further, 
some 72 of these works are mentioned in Mr. 
Einstein's text, most of them without any foot- 
notes. 

On page 336 of the " Elizabethan Transla- 
tions " a quotation from Roger Aseham is im- 
mediately followed by one from Dr. Johnson ; 
on page 108 of the " Italian Renaissance in 
England " the same juxtaposition of authori- 
ties occurs, but the references cite the original 
■works. On pages 61 and 62 of the " Elizabethan 
Translations "' there is a discussion of the in- 
fluence of the Mantuan on Shakespeare and 
Spenser ; the same subject is treated on pages 
347 and 348 of the '• Italian Renaissance in 
England," with the same references, but cited 
as from the original, except that a quotation 
from Drake's " Shakspeare and his Times," 
is transferred to the more recent " Life of 
Shakspere" by Mr. Sidney Lee. The ident- 
ity of authorities in this instance represents 
such an unusual concatenation of persons as 
Mantuanus, Shakespeare, Alexander Barclay, 
^neas Sylvius Piccolomini, and F. Kluge. 
Surely Mr. Einstein has failed to meet the 
moral obligations here involved by acknowl- 
edging his indebtedness to the " Elizabethan 
Translations from the Italian '" twice only 
throughout his book, and by the cursory sen- 
tence in his preface which probably led to 
" The Athenaeum's " criticism. 

Nor is it the author of " Elizabethan Trans- 
lations from the Italian " alone who may justly 
object to Mr. Einstein's too free borrowing. 
For the Italianization of Spenser, Mr. Einstein 
closely follows an article by Professor R. E. 
Xeil Dodge on " Spenser's Imitations from 
Ariosto." He calls the paper " Imitations from 
Ariosto," and cites it "Proceedings [sic] 
Modern Language Association, 1897." Pro- 
fessor Dodges name is nowhere mentioned. 
The references in the foot-notes to page 342, 
unacknowledged there, and with one of the 
Spenser citations incorrect, may be found on 
pagesl82 and 183 of Professor Dodge's article 
in the " Publications of the Modern Language 
Association." So, also, the striking phrase 
*' reflective and picturesque," describing the 
total effect of >• The Faerie Queene " (Mr. 
Einstein, p. 343), is Professor Dodge's ("Pub- 
lications," 1897, pp. 183-4). While it is the 



scholar's happy privilege to use freely the 
published results of the labors of others, this 
privilege carries with it the equally happy duty 
of acknowledging its exercise. To neglect the 
duty is to abuse the privilege.

Reckst Texts ix LiITKrature.* 

We have had many school manuals of Am- 
erican literature, but none more readable than 
the " Introduction to the Study of American 
Literature " which has been prepared by Pro- 
fessor William Cranston Lawton. It is not 
easy to make a book of this sort readable, and 
many authors do not attempt the task. Those 
who do are apt to place their main reliance 
upon attention to a few great names and move- 
ments, ignoring the minor matters that can 
make a page so forbidding. Mr. Lawton has 
not shirked the obligation to give his treat- 
ment some degree of completeness (although 
the scale is small), and many of his pages 
are crowded with names and titles. But even 
where they come together most thickly he 
contrives to introduce a fresh phrase or a telling 
epithet that has a wonderful way of lighting up 
the text. He is naively personal at times, as 
when after his account of Poe, he speaks of it 
as " the present rather hostile study," and calls 
Mr. Woodberry " as sympathetic a biographer 
and expositor as any healthy human nature 
with temperate blood is ever likely to prove." 
A still more personal note is found in these 
words upon Lydia Maria Child : 

"As for the exact liter»py rank of this heroic woman, 
the critical scales must be passed to younger and cooler 
hands. In the homes of a ' few original Garrisonians ' 
her earlv books were still cherished. We learned to 
read, that we might not be dependent on our busy el- 
ders for daily absorption in her ' Flowers for Children.' 
Our own of&pring seem to detect a moral and Edge- 
worthian flavor in the cherished volume, and prefer 
' Little Women.' We first heard the very names of 
Pericles and Plato in her Greek romance ' Pbilothea.'

[April 16, 



The ■ Letters from New York ' widened the vista of a 
village street to our boyish eyes." 

We doubt very much if such confessions as 
these belong in a school history of literature, 
but we are sure that they will be grateful to 
readers who are not school children. And it 
is certainly not for a juvenile audience that 
Mr. Lawton has penned words such as these: 

" Mr Aldrich recalls a previous incarnation on the 
banks of old Nile ; and, indeed, so far as pure and seri- 
ous art, with a dash of dreamy idealism still, may drift 
from the austerer tradition of Puritanism, he has de- 
parted. . . . His best short stories have a large vein of mis- 
chief and mystification. His lunger novels perhaps lack 
somewhat the justification of broad view or large ethical 
purpose, but all the too little that he writes is enjoyed." 

These sentences are altogether typical of Mr. 
Lawton's manner, and explain why he has 
made a book so interesting to mature minds, al- 
beit one not likely to appeal to school children. 
We defy the average child to make any thing out 
of such a delightful paragraph as that on a 
later page devoted to " Hans Breitmann." We 
certainly cannot quarrel with Mr. Lawton 
for giving us a book so much better than any 
mere school book has a right to be, but there 
are one or two minor points of criticism that 
must not be omitted. No one, from the ac- 
count of Longfellow's "Christus," could get 
any exact notion of the plan and structure of 
that work. And it is certainly not true that, 
as a result of the Civil War, " There is to be 
but one Anglo-Saxon nation on this conti- 
nent." These, and a few other instances of 
careless statement, are the trifling defects of a 
work which is packed with ideas and allusions, 
which has an unfailing freshness of touch, and 
which deserves to extend its influences far be- 
yond the bounds of the school room. 

A more leisurely treatment of our literary 
annals, designed for the general reader rather 
than for the uses of schools, is the work of 
Professor Lorenzo Sears, and is entitled "Amer- 
ican Literature in its Colonial and National Pe- 
riods." The author is in sympathy with his 
subject, and writes from a wide first-hand 
acquaintance with the literature which he 
discusses. He introduces many illustrative 
quotations, and they prove to be surprisingly 
unhackneyed, although quite as typical of their 
authors as the excerpts commonly met with 
in works of this description. The book is dis- 
tinctly the author's own, and not the compila- 
tion of earlier compilations which a text-book 
of our literature is so apt to be. It is, moreover, 
distinguished by sobriety of judgment, and its 
originality is not gained by paradoxical opinions 



or startling departures from the views generally 
accepted. Mr. Sears does not make himself 
the champion of any particular man or set of 
men at the expense of others, nor does he seek 
to attract attention by any eccentricities of 
manner. He is the master of a flowing and 
graceful style which always pleases, and which 
leaves a pleasant memory behind. As far as 
we may say that his book has a method, it is 
that of dividing his subject into neat com- 
partments, each of his nearly two score chap- 
ters being given either to a single author or 
to a clearly-defined group, such as " Ply- 
mouth Diarists," "The Knickerbocker|Group," 
" Southern Orators," and "American Humor." 
This method inevitably results in omissions 
that sometimes seem serious, or to the slurring 
over of names that one would like to see ac- 
corded a more conspicuous treatment. The 
most notable illustration of this defect is found 
in the failure to give adequate attention to the 
"transcendental " movement in New England. 
We have separate chapters on Emerson and 
Thoreau, but " The Dial " is not so much a» 
named, and mere mention of her name is the 
only notice taken of Margaret Fuller. Colonel 
Higginson should have something to say on this 
subject. A convenient reading list is appended 
to the work. 

The " Student's History of English Liter- 
ature" which has been written by Professor 
W. E. Simonds is a book after the conven- 
tional pattern, prepared with close reference to 
the needs of schools, and crammed with in- 
formation. As far as it has distinguishing 
characteristics, they may be summarized by 
saying that more than the usual attention is 
given to English history, to the biographies of 
authors, and to matters of philological inter- 
est. The illustrations are singularly interest- 
ing, being mostly facsimiles of the printed 
or manuscript page and old wood-cuts and 
drawings. The bibliographical matter is un- 
usually copious, and the book is well provided 
with questions, exercises, and other matters 
helpful from a pedagogical point of view. Ex- 
tracts are introduced in considerable numbers, 
but they are so brief that they do not crowd 
unfairly the historical and critical text. Mr. 
Simonds is careful in his judgments of authors 
to present the approved views of criticism 
rather than any fancies of his own. This 
makes him a safe guide, and he is also an em- 
inently readable one. The volume ends with 
a literary map of England and an elaborate in- 
dex which calls for a word of special praise.

Mr. Henry S. Pancoast, whose histories of 
English and American literature, with the ac- 
companying volumes of standard selections, 
have met with such wide and well-deserved 
favor, has added to the series a book of 
" Standard English Prose," the selections rang- 
ing from Bacon to Stevenson. The selections 
are reasonably long, and in nearly all cases are 
complete compositions. This method necessi- 
tates the omission altogether of some writers 
for whom we should naturally look, but the 
thirty-five who are represented provide a goodly 
variety of styles, and illustrate all of the highly 
important phases in the development of our 
prose literature. Fifteen of the number are 
writers of the last century, and those belong- 
ing strictly to our own time are Newman, 
Froude, Kuskin, Arnold, Pater, and Stevenson 
— a judicious selection, on the whole. The 
longest selection in the volume is Macaulay's 
" Milton." In an appendix we are given brief 
examples of a few of the earlier prose writers, 
from Wyclif to Sidney, and then comes a body 
of notes filling a hundred pages. 

"A Study of Prose Fiction," by Mr. Bliss 
Perry, is not entirely a book for school uses, 
although it had its origin in a course of college 
lectures, and includes practical exercises for 
students of literature. No one could be better 
qualified than Mr. Perry for the production of 
a treatise of this sort, for his connection with 
the art of story-writing is of a three-fold char- 
acter, practical, pedagogical, and editorial. 
He puts the case, over-modestly, in these terms : 

" It happened that the author wrote fiction, after a 
fashion, before attempting to lecture upon it, and he is 
now conscious that the academic point of view has in 
turn been modified by the impressions gained during 
his editorship of 'The Atlantic Monthly.' Whether 
the professional examination of many thousands of man- 
nscript stories is calculated to exhalt one's standards of 
the art of fiction may possibly be questioned. But this 
editorial experience, supplementing the other methods 
of approach to the subject, may be thought to contrib- 
ute something of practical value to the present study of 
the novelist's work." 

The book is based upon the thesis " that as 
the traveller who has studied architecture most 
carefully will get the most pleasure out of a 
cathedral, so the thorough student of literary art 
will receive most enjoyment from the master- 
pieces which that art has produced." A corol- 
lary of this proposition is that literature (in- 
cluding fiction) has its laws and the criticism 
thereof its canons ; that the business of the 
critic is to be acquainted with the former and 
to apply the latter to whatever case he may 
have at hand. He " takes for granted that 



there is a body of doctrine concerning fiction, 
as there is concerning paintings or architec- 
ture or music and that the artistic principles 
involved are no more incapable of formulation 
than are the laws of the art of poetry, as 
expressed in treatises upon Poetics from Aris- 
totle's day to our own." Or, as the matter is 
neatly expressed in a later paragraph, " that 
Aristotle and Lessing, in short, wrote with one 
eye on Mr. Kipling and Mr. Hardy." So Mr. 
Perry proceeds to discuss the principles of the 
art of fiction under such heads as fiction and 
the drama, fiction and science, the characters, 
the plot, realism, and romanticism. And at 
every stage of the discussion, he enforces his 
theoretical points by the most felicitous of 
illustrations. If we were to choose among Mr. 
Perry's thirteen chapters those which strike 
the deepest root, we could not be far astray in 
singling out the twin discussions of realism and 
romanticism. Here we find an analysis which 
leaves nothing nnsaid that is essential, and 
which shows us, by implication, how futile is 
the greater part of the controversial literature 
that has been devoted to this dual theme, how 
foolish it is for a man to attach to himself or 
his work either label. And the writer now 
and then takes a firm grasp upon the ethics 
of literary art, as in the following passage : 
" There are thousands of good people who are shocked 
— as perhaps they ought to be — by a story that de- 
scribes in plain terms the yielding of a young man to 
sexual temptations, but who are not shocked in the least 
by a story that glorifies brute force, sings the praise of 
war, and teaches that for the individual or the nation 
it is might that makes right." 

With this fine sentiment we take a reluctant 
leave of this book, which is deserving of very 
high praise, both for the sanity of its teaching 
and for the unfailing charm of its manner.

The Stort of Helen Keller.* 

Sixty-five years ago Dr. S. G. Howe of Bos- 
ton gave forth the then somewhat startling an- 
nouncement that he was educating a child de- 
prived of sight and hearing. The results of 
his instruction of Laura Bridgman were widely 
heralded over the civilized world. When in 
1887 Miss Sullivan approached the same prob- 
lem in the case of Helen Keller, then a child

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



of seven years of age, the difficulties of the 
task were far better understood. The possibili- 
ties of an education in spite of the curtailment 
of the ordinary avenues of knowledge ob- 
viously depend upon the individual gifts of the 
subject. Everyone knows that Helen Keller 
was a remarkable child and has grown to be a 
remarkable young woman. The story of her 
life is now published in adequate form, and 
serves to intensify, as well as to rationalize, 
the note of admiration which everywhere greets 
an account of her achievements. 

The volume consists of an autobiography, of 
a well-selected selection of her letters written 
from her seventh to her twenty-first year, and 
of an account of her instruction, prepared 
largely by Miss Sullivan, with additional com- 
ments by the editor of the volume, Mr. J. A. 
Macy. All three collaborators have done their 
work well ; and especial attention should be 
directed to the value of Miss Sullivan's letters 
written at the time of her taking charge of 
Helen Keller, and now for the first time given 
to the public. These letters indicate an appre- 
ciation of the psychological and educational 
problems involved in bringing up a bright but 
sightless and silent child, which one would have 
expected from the result, but which it is most 
assuring to read in print as a contemporaneous 
record. In a letter written only a few months 
after she found her way to the mind of her 
charge, Miss Sullivan writes : " No one can see 
her without being impressed. She is no ordi- 
nary child, and peoples' interest in her education 
will be no ordinary interest. Therefore let us 
be exceedingly careful what we say and write 
about her." Miss Sullivan was fortunately free 
from adherence to any pet theory or method, 
but was able to adapt sound principles of edu- 
cation to the special conditions that were set 
before her. The result is that Miss Keller to- 
day participates freely in most of the intellect- 
ual life of her age. 

The book in the main is Helen Keller's book, 
and the interest in her is a genuine interest in 
her personality ; for, as Miss Sullivan well says, 
Laura Bridgman remained to the end of her 
days a curiosity, but Helen Keller has been 
almost from the outset a distinct personality. 
One of the ways to suggest the interest of the 
narrative will be the presentation of a few ex- 
tracts, which show the young woman as she is 
today, — a student at Radcliffe, with all the 
interests of a student and the enthusiasm of 
youth. Like many students, she often grows 
rebellious at methods that do not suit her tem- 



perament ; but, unlike many students, she has 
a greater fertility in expressing her impatience. 
In a theme recently submitted in the course in 
literature, she writes as follows : 

"Ah! the pranks that the nixies of Dreamland play 
on us while we sleep! Methinks they are 'jesters at the 
court of heaven.' They frequently take the shape of 
daily themes to mock me. They strut about on the stage 
of sleep like the foolish virgins, only they carry well- 
trimmed notebooks in their hands instead of empty 
lamps. At other times they examine and cross ex- 
amine me in all the studies I have ever had, invariably 
asking me questions as easy to answer as this : ' What 
was the name of the first mouse that worried Hippo- 
potamus, satrap of Cambridge under Astyagas, grand- 
father of Cyrus the Great? ' I awake terror-stricken, 
with the words ringing in my ears — ' An answer or 
your life!'" 

Examinations come in for a considerable share 
of her disdain. 

" The days before these ordeals take place are spent 
in the cramming of your mind with mystic formulse and 
indigestible dates, unpalatable diets, until you wish that 
books and science and you were buried in the depths of 
the sea . . . ' Give a brief account of Huss and his work.' 
Huss? Who was he and what did he do? The name 
looks familiar. You ransack your budget of historic 
facts much as you hunt for a bit of silk in a rag-bag. 
You are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the 
top — you saw it there the other day when you were 
looking up the beginnings of the Reformation. But 
where is it now? You fish out all manner of odds and 
ends of knowledge — revolutions, schisms, massacres, 
systems of government; but Huss — where is he? You 
are amazed at all the things you know which are not on 
the examination paper. In desperation you seize the bud- 
get and dump everything out, and there in the corner 
is your man, serenely brooding on his own private 
thought, unconscious of the catastrophe which he has 
brought upon you. Just then the proctor informs you 
that the time is up." 

Helen Keller's talk is as good as her writing. 
She is quick at repartee, anxious to give and 
take, and has an unusual sense of humour. 
When Dr. Furness warned her not to credit too 
implicitly all that her Harvard professors might 
tell her about the life of Shakespeare, of whom 
we know only that he was baptized, married, 
and died, her answer was ready : " Well, he 
seems to have done all the essential things." 
Her letters, often conversational in tone, reflect 
the temper of her character. She is ever fond 
of a dig at the rigid requirements of study that 
do not bear upon the human side of life. " I 
am sure the daisies and buttercups have as 
little use for the science of Geometry as I, in 
spite of the fact that they so beautifully illus- 
trate its principles." " I detest grammar as 
much as you do ; but I suppose I must go 
through it if I am to write, just as we had to 
get ducked in the lake hundreds of times 
before we could swim!" Her philosophy is

naturally of a piece with her passion for the 
humanities ; it is often quaintly practical. " I 
hope," she writes " that L. isn't too practical, 
for if she is, I' m afraid she will miss a great 
deal of pleasure." When the question of her 
taking a regular course at college was at issue, 
she writes to a friend : " I found it hard, very 
hard, to give up the idea of going to college ; 
it had been in my mind ever since I was a 
little girl ; but there is no use doing a foolish 
thing, because one has wanted to do it a long 
time, is there? " She writes to the instructor 
in literature at Radcli£fe: "When I came to 
your class last October, I was trying with all 
my might to be like everybody else, to forget 
as entirely as possible my limitations and pecu- 
liar environment. Now, however, I see the 
folly of attempting to hitch one's wagon to a 
star with harness that does not belong to it." 

A young woman of twenty-two who writes 
and talks like this ; who is equally enthusiastic 
over a walk in the woods or a sail on the water 
as over the treasures of Homer or Shakes- 
peare ; who can become absorbed over a game 
of checkers or solitaire ; who is as much con- 
vulsed by the nonsense of Lear or the clever 
topsyturvydom of " Lewis Carroll " as the 
most ardent devotee of those ministers to the 
gaiety of life ; whose knowledge of the history 
of the race is extensive and accurate, as her 
appreciation of literature is sincere and com- 
prehensive ; who converses in two or three lan- 
guages and reads as many more ; who counts 
among her friends the most gifted and the 
most eminent contributors to the intellectual 
life of the day ; — surely such a life can hardly 
be spoken of as an uninteresting or impover- 
ished one for any person of modest years. We 
cannot forget that these achievements and the 
privileges that they have brought, are those of 
one who knows no color and hears no sound, 
whose avenues of communion with the world 
are at the best indirect and awkward, and for 
whom many of the most intimate facilities for 
keeping aglow the torch of learning are ever 
beyond reach. Yet the most sincere testimony 
to the inherent value of her narrative is that 
in reading it one is often more engrossed by the 
sentiment and the vigor of what is said than 
by the peculiar condition of the writer. 

The story of how all this was accomplished 
is one of pronounced interest to the educator 
and to the psychologist ; its interest is not a 
technical one, however, and is sure to find a 
wide circle of readers. It seemed important to 
call attention in these columns to the literary 



attractiveness of this remarkable human docu- 
ment, and to arouse an interest in the develop- 
ment of Helen Keller's mind by indicating, 
however inadequately, the personality of the 
young junior at Radcliffe.

Some Recent Books on Education.* 



In a volame of five handred pages, Dr. Elmer 
E. Brown of the University of California has told, 
for the first time, the story of " The Making of our 
Middle Schools. " The first third of the book 
treats of the old grammar or Latin school, as it ex- 
isted in both England and America ; the next sec- 
tion describes the academy ; the last and most im- 
portant section is reserved for the high school 
movement with its attendant problems. The ap- 
pendix contains statistical and descriptive data not 
elsewhere accessible in convenient form, and a well- 
selected critical bibliography of the subject filling 
forty pages. The work is well indexed. Dr. 
Brown has written a book characterized by thorough- 
ness of scholarship, a judicial spirit, and compre- 
hensiveness. He has succeeded very largely in that 
most difficult phase of his undertaking to an edu- 
cational historian, — the correlation of scholastic 
institutions with outside social forces. His treat- 
ment of religions and political movements in re- 
lation to education is full and satisfactory ; the 
economic factor nnfortnnately does not receive the 
same attention. The strength of German and other 
foreign influence on secondary education in Amer- 
ica daring the period of the educational revival is 
underestimated. The definition of secondary edu- 
cation contained in the introductory chapter, while 
historically correct for the American middle schools, 
is unscientific inasmncb as it ignores the essentially

secondary character of much of the work done in 
American colleges. These are points of minor im- 
portance, however. This history of secondary edu- 
cation is the most creditable and considerable book 
on American education yet published. 

" The Making of Citizens, a Study in Compara- 
tive Education," is the somewhat misleading title 
of a recent volume in the " Contemporary Science 
Series " by Prof. R. E. Hughes. This work aims 
to do for the English-speaking public what M. 
Levasseur has done for France in the way of pre- 
senting in a systematic form the most important 
facts concerning schools. Prof. Hughes confines 
himself to the schools of England, France, Ger- 
many, and the United States, and treats of the 
primary school system, the secondary school sys- 
tem, the education of girls and of defective child- 
ren. Not satisfied with important statistics and 
the framework of the school code, Prof. Hughes 
points out the relation which these facts bear to the 
' vital problems facing each nation. This method 
adds greatly to the interest of the book. The au- 
thor is free from bias, and sees the main educa- 
tional problems in proper perspective. His knowl- 
edge of the details of some of the school systems, 
particularly the American, is limited and leads to 
a namber of questionable statements, such as the 
following : " American children seem to be losing 
the faculty of play " p. 173 ; " The primary schools 
of America do not meet the needs ... of the great 
body of German and Scandinavian immigrants " 
p. 193; "In America, . . . the real vocation of a 
public secondary school to act as an intermediate 
step to a university has been largely abandoned to 
private secondary schools " p. 203- 

Prof. John E. Adamson, in his " Theory of Ed- 
ucation in Plato's ' Republic,' " has produced a 
closely-considered logical analysis of the pedagog- 
ical sections of the " Republic." This analysis, 
however, forms only the introductory portion of 
the various chapters, which treat of such topics as 
the substance of literature, the form of literature, 
melody and rhythm, and gymnastic culture. Prof. 
Adamson's chief aim is to show us the signifi- 
cance of Plato's standpoint in a modern philosophy 
of education. Our education to-day is too complex 
in its machinery, too many-sided in its interests ; 
under the leadership of individualists like Rousseau 
and Locke, we have lost sight of the simple social 
aims of education ; hence " Back to Plato ! " should 
be our cry : — this in brief is our author's thesis. 
In thus endeavoring to apply Plato's theories to the 
needs of the twentieth century, he has essayed 
a difficult undertaking, but in a large measure he 
has succeeded. The book lacks neither maturity, 
logical precision, nor suggestiveness. It is well 
adapted to serve as a basis for discussion in that 
well-nigh obsolete subject, — the philosophy of ed- 
ucation. Prof. Adamson does not attempt to trace 
Plato's indebtedness, or compare his suggestions 
with the practice of the Athenians ; he ignores 
Aristotle and all succeeding classical writers on ed- 



ucation. This method of treating Plato's educa- 
tional ideas, as largely the result of his own creative 
genius, is likely to lead unwary readers to a highly- 
exaggerated notion of the originality of the great 
Athenian. 

The theory of interest recently set forth by 
Dr. John Dewey is the central theme in Prof. 
De Garmo's " Interest and Education : The Doc- 
trine of Interest and its Concrete Application." 
According to this view, pleasurable excitement in 
connection with study does not of itself constitute 
true interest. Pleasurable excitement can only be 
termed interest when it is the result of a persistent 
effort to attain ends in the interest of self-expression. 
The first four chapters of Prof. De Garmo's book 
cover the theoretical considerations; the remaining 
eleven deal with the application of the new stand- 
point to such educational questions as elective stud- 
ies, motor training, and methods. Perhaps the most 
useful chapters for teachers are those on the art of 
exposition and the art of questioning. The book is 
well written, and several of the chapters contain 
clever bits of characterization. 

An unconventional treatment of a shop-worn 
subject is found in Prof. Frank Cramer's " Talks 
to Students on the Art of Study." An outline of 
psychological theory drawn largely from Prof. 
James provides the framework of the book, but 
does not determine its character. Its aim is not 
" to fill the place of a manual of logic, psychology, 
or pedagogy," but to " furnish effective suggestion 
to the student who is passing through the critical 
period of his intellectual life." The author is as 
good as his word. From a wide and varied ex- 
perience, he has gathered a number of apt and tell- 
ing illustrations which he states with unusual force 
and earnestness. The difficulties in the formation 
of correct intellectual habits are made sufficiently 
concrete to strike home to the average student of 
the late high school or early college period. Like 
many writers with a similar practical aim in view, 
Prof. Cramer exaggerates the role of the individual's 
volitions ; this very exaggeration, however, tends to 
increase the pedagogical efficiency of the work. It 
is a stirring appeal for correct habits in thinking. 

The second part of Miss Mary E. Wilson's 
translation of M. Gabriel Compayr^'s " L'E volution 
Intellectuelle et Moral de I'Eafant" has been pub- 
lished as the fifty-third volume of the "International 
Education Series." This portion of the translation 
is entitled " Development of the Child in Later In- 
fancy." The topics here treated are the following : 
(1) imitation and curiosity, (2) judgment and rea- 
son, (3) learning to speak, (4) walking and play, 
(5) development of the moral sense, (6) weak and 
strong points of character, (7 ) morbid tendencies, 
and (8) sense of selfhood. Many of the chapters 
are as essential to the student of ethics and sociology 
as to the genetic psychologist. The clearness and 
charm of the author's style and his use of literary 
as well as scientific sources for the study of children 
will tend to secure for him a wider circle of read-

en than similar books have g^ained. His present 
book is withoat doubt the most complete treatment 
of the child daring infancy accessible to the Amer- 
ean reader. 

The most valaable feature of Dr. Charles 
McMarry's" Special Method in the Reading of Com- 
plete English Classics in the Grades of the Com- 
mon School" is a earef ally-prepared bibliography 
of children's classics. For the period beginning with 
the fourth grade and ending at the first year of the 
high school. Dr. McMurry has arranged three par- 
allel lists of books. In the first colamn he places 
Tolames suitable for class-room use. In the second 
column are the supplementary reference books valu- 
able for children bat not sufficiently finished in their 
literary form to justify their inclusion in the first col- 
amn. The third colamn contains books for teachers, 
chiefly history, biography, literature, and pedagogy; 
this list needs further classification These three 
lists have been submitted to a number of superin- 
tendents, and revised in the light of their criticism. 
Critical and descriptive notes are freqaent, and an 
exhaustive enumeration of the various inexpensive 
editions, with the names of their publishers, is in- 
cluded. While the average teacher may take an 
exception to some title here and there as too ad- 
vanced for the grade 8i>eeified, in general Dr. 
McMarry has provided a highly satisfactory guide 
for children's reading both at home and at school. 
Pedagogical chapters full of excellent suggestions 
and valuable quotations occupy the bulk of the vol- 
ume. It is unfortunate that so useful a book shoold 
be marred by an occasional touch of sentimentality. 

Simultaneously with the volume just mentioned 
is published a new edition of ■' The Method of Re- 
citation," by Professors Charles A. and Frank M. 
McMurry. In mechanical setting, the new edition 
is a great improvement on the old. Marginal notes 
in small tyi>e add greatly to the usefulness of the 
work as a text-book. The majority of the chapters 
remain substantially identical in the two editions, 
but a few of the later ones have been entirely remod- 
eled. The chapter on •' Socratic Method " in the old 
edition is here omitted, and a new section on model 
lessons is included. The changes have aU been made 
in the interests of greater clearness and compactness, 
bat in no way do they alter the general character of

In quantity increasing annually, the 
piteajnma* literature of the Civil War period 
C«r« War. grows upon the American reading 

public. The latest contributions to the stock of this 
class of books are in one respect the most valaable. 
Distance of time has given a broader view of the pe- 
culiar relations between the two parties to the inter- 
necine strife, and asperity and distrust have on both 
sides given way to a more amiable and appreciative 
feeling respecting those who were once enemies. As 



Bulwer's soldier phrased it, " We always think more 
highly of a man after having fought with him. " 
Two recent volumes of Civil War reminiscences, 
one presenting the Federal and the other the Con- 
federate side, illustrate this kindlier view that the 
retrospect of the present day furnishes of a contest 
that once manifested only bitterness. Mr. Daniel 
Wait Howe, who was once an Indiana soldier and 
officer, presents under the title of '• Civil War 
Times" (Bo wen-Merrill), an entertaining and in- 
structive recital, which combines his own personal 
experiences in camp, on the march, and on the field, 
with a running commentary covering the leading and 
prominent events of the entire war period. Though 
this combination results in a sort of melange, criti- 
cism of the oddity of this form of literary compto- 
sition is disarmed by the fidelity and accuracy 
which distinguish the historical portions of the 
book, and the agreeable ingenuousness of the per- 
sonal recollections. Mr. Howe is a fearless censor 
of the incompetency and bungling and jealousj 
whicn too often marked the conduct of prominent 
Federal officers ; but he is also the bold champion 
of the fame and honor of such generals as George 
H. Thomas, who won his admiration, and in snch 
cases he gives good reasons, found in his own ex- 
perience and observation, for the praise he bestows. 
His accounts of the operations of the Army of the 
Cumberland, during the battles of Stone River, 
Chickamauga. and Chattanooga, and the East Ten- 
nessee and Atlanta campaigns, are so full and cir- 
cumspect as to merit the name of fair military 
history. The author's personal reminiscences, includ- 
ing the extracts from his diaries of the time, serve 
to present a living picture of camp life and field ex- 
periences in the Union army in the South. — A cor- 
responding picture of the like experiences of the 
Confederate officers and soldiers in the Eastern 
army (Virginia), aa seen by the yoang and viva- 
cious wife of a Soathern officer, is presented ander 
the title of -A Virginia Girl in the Civil War" 
( Appleton). The recollections of this lady — who 
is given, in their recital, the name of Mrs. Daniel 
Grey — are collected and edited for her by Mrs. 
Myrta Lockett Avary of New York. Her story of 
the vicissitudes of her army life, her joarneys with 
or in the wake of the command in which her hus- 
band was serving, her life in camp or barracks, her 
services in hospital, her anxieties in the time of bat- 
tle and the dangers from foes and the elements 
which she encoantered, her passing of the blockade 
and her hardships as a prisoner, all are portrayed 
with a vividness of recollection that brings the 
reader of today into some appreciation of the stren- 
uous character of the army life of that time. 
Throughout the narrative, the zeal of devotion to 
the " bonnie blue flag " and the cause it represented 
is tempered by a recognition of the manly and no- 
ble qualities exhibited in many of the officers and 
soldiers of the Federal army whom the sparkling 
Southern lady encountered. It is out of such sketches 
of personal experience, prepared by the participants

themselves, when kept free from all harshness and

A^mmaryos ^ ^^ry acceptable resume, of the 
English consiiia- history of England in its constitu- 
iwnai history. tional aspects, and one that promises 
to prove of great usefulness to students, is the work 
of Mrs. Lucy Dale, a student of Somerville College, 
Oxford. It bears the title of " The Principles of 
English Constitutional History" (Longmans); but 
a title more explanatory of the scope and objects 
of the work would have been " A Summary of 
English Constitutional History." It is a rapid but 
discriminating statement, in review, of the progress 
and development of constitutionalism in England, 
from the Roman period to the early part of the 
nineteenth century. The salient facts of each 
recurring epoch, as gleaned from the standard his- 
tories, are set forth in the form of the author's con- 
clusions, and with a brevity that seems dogmatic. 
Such would appear to be the author's chosen method, 
as she has abstained from citing authorities to sup- 
port the averments of her text. We infer that her 
aim is to furnish a treatise for students, to follow 
their reading in the general popular histories, and 
to serve them as a guide to the closer study of the 
fundamentals of government, as disclosed in the 
works of the constitutional historians. We are of 
opinion that the work will well serve to fill this 
place in the curriculum of students of these sub- 
jects. What were the inner meanings of the changes 
which were experienced during the centuries by 
that anomalous system called the English Consti- 
tution are here pointed out, briefly and succinctly, 
but always clearly. For instance, the devotion of 
the English people to both the institutions of the 
kingship and the parliament is kept before the 
student as a principle continuously asserting itself ; 
and the Restoration of the Stuarts is shown to 
exhibit a new assertion of that principle, rather 
than an undue fondness for a particular family 
of monarchs. This summary history of 440 pages 
is followed by a condensed " Analysis of Con- 
tents," in fifteen pages, which is in itself a brief con- 
spectus of the entire body of the work, showing 
almost at a glance, and in the most convenient 
form, the successive constitutional aspects which 
have been more copiously illustrated in the twelve 
chapters of the work. If we mistake not, Mrs. 
Dale's treatise will prove quite acceptable to his- 
torical study classes connected with clubs, as well as 
to those in the higher schools. 

Sheridan's plays, ^r. W. Fraser Rae, already known 
printed as he as a careful student of Richard 

wrote them. Brinsley Sheridan's life and times, 

as evinced in his biography of the playwright, has 
now given us " Sheridan's Plays, Now Printed as 
he Wrote Them, and his Mother's Unpublished 



Comedy, ' A Journey to Bath ' " (London : David 
Nutt). An Introduction by Sheridan's great- 
grandson, the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, adds 
interest to the work, which is increased by Mr. 
Rae's profuse " Prefatory Notes." From these last 
it may be learned that " Sheridan's grandfather " 
(evidently a misprint for " father," the grandfather 
having died in 1738) " gave much time and care to 
arranging the manuscripts of ' The Rivals,' ' The 
Duenna,' ' The School for Scandal,' and ' The 
Critic,' and he had them bound in handsome vol- 
umes." It is from these that the present edition is 
prepared ; and it appears that not only are all the 
editions now in print taken from the acting versions, 
as distinguished from the author's, but the edition 
published by Murray in 1821, and usually regarded 
as definitive, was edited by Wilkie on the good old 
simple plan of striking out the things he did not like 
and saying nothing about them. " The Rivals," 
however, is not taken from the author's first manu- 
script, which is thought to have perished with the 
burning of Covent Garden Theatre. What is stated 
in several modern authorities to be a rumor, — that 
" The Rivals " was ill-received on its first produc- 
tion, owing largely to the poor presentation made 
by Mr. Lee of the part of Sir Lucius O'Trigger, — 
is finally confirmed by Mr. Rae, who makes copious 
citations from the contemporary daily press in proof, 
and makes it all the more to be regretted that the 
original manuscript has not survived to tell the 
world what changes were made in the eleven days 
that elapsed between the first and second presen- 
tations, the success of the piece being thereby 
achieved. But Sheridan himself prepared a copy 
of " The Rivals " for publication, which is followed 
here ; and this differs in several respects from the 
acting version with which modern play-goers are fa- 
miliar. Lord Dufferin's Introduction is interesting 
rather than important, and contains some sentences 
setting forth that nobleman's conceptions of his an- 
cestor's principal characters. The critic will thank 
Mr. Rae for his inclusion of Sheridan's mother's 
fragmentary composition, " A Journey to Bath," 
since the son made use of it, though the use is slight 
at best, and is not shown in " The Rivals," as some- 
times alleged, but in " The School for Scandal." 

In the latter part of the sixteenth 
century there lived, in a small tene- 
ment in Dean's Yard, Westminster, 
William Camden, an old man who had been Head- 
master of Westminster School, and was then Clar- 
encieux King-at-Arms under Queen Elizabeth. He 
was also an antiquary and annalist. To his fond- 
ness for "diverting" himself among the tombs 
and ancient monuments we owe the first attempt 
at a guide-book of the Abbey, — a list, in Latin, of 
the chief monuments, with their inscriptions. It 
was published in 1600. Since then, writing books 
about Westminster Abbey has been an occupation 
especially attractive to those who have lived within 
the Abbey's precincts ; and we have some deeply in-

terestiog books in eonseqaenee, — Dean Stanley's 
'■ Memoriale,'' for example. The " Annals " and the 
'• Deanerj Gaide " were written by Miss E. T. Brad- 
ley, who is the danghter of Dean Stanley's gneeewor. 
The last-named book was first published in 1885, 
and its Talne to the risitor to tiie great Abbey is 
attested by the fact that it has passed throagh 
twelve editions. Its writer (who has since become 
Mrs. A. Murray Smith), feeling that there was a 
eall for a guide-book to the Abbey smaller than 
Dean Stanley's •• Memorials " or her own "Annals," 
yet more comprehensive than the " Deanery Guide," 
has provided such a book in "The RoU-CaU of 
Westminster Abbey" (Macmillan). This is an 
attempt to furnish some bistorieal knowledge of the 
dead who are buried or commemorated in the Abbey; 
and while such an idea may not seem to promise 
Tery favorable results, Mrs. Murray Smith has 
saeeeeded in making a very readable book, — full 
of interest to one who is fond of antiquarian lore. 
It is. in fact, a guide-book relieved of its systematie 
dnlnesB. Elaborate ground-plans at the end of the 
book add to its value as a guide, and the half-tone 
fnll-ptage illustrations, twenty-five in number, being 
from photographs recently taken, gfive more accur- 
ate ideas of the Abbey interior than those with 
which we are more familiar. The colors of the 
binding correspond with the blue-and-gold hangings 
with which the Abbey was draped at the Coron»- 
tion of Edward VII. 

The way of the translator of Aris- 
totle is sufficiently hard to make it 
a matter of special congratulation 
when a competent scholar turns his attention to this 
field. Professor TV. A. Hammond, who holds the 
chair of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy at Cor- 
nell, has the training both of the philosopher and of 
the classical scholar, and the translation of Aristotle's 
Psychology which represents the first fruits of his 
labors is likely to remain a standard for some time 
to come ( Macmillan). It includes the " De Anima " 
and the ** Parva Naturalia." Of the latter there has 
hitherto been no satisfactory translation ; and while 
Wallace's translation of the " De Anima " is in many 
respects excellent, the success of this new attempt 
jastifies it, apart from the desirability of having all 
of Aristotle's psychological writings in a single vol- 
ame. A valuable introduction sums up Aristotle's 
psychological doctrines with a clearness and suc- 
cinctness which leaves little to be desired. The 
final section, on Aristotle's conception of the crea- 
tive reason, is particularly successful in dispelling 
the haie which has gathered about that disputed 
question. Professor Hammond is notably objective 
in his whole treatment, and avoids the tendency, 
Tery noticeable in Wallace among others, to read 
Aristotle too much in the light of modern, and 
especially Hegelian, philosophy. The translation 
itself is easy and straightforward, and almost al- 
ways clear where the text will allow of clearness. 
Expositions of the more difficult passages are given 



jr«w 



in foot-notes. These are found just where they are 
needed ; and in general the author evidently has th» 
notion that notes are intended for the reader's 
enlightenment, rather than as a display of erudition. 
They are unusually free from useless lumber. While 
Aristotle cannot b« recommended for light reading, 
the book ought to meet with a welcome beyond th» 
ranks of the specialist. The Psychology is less well 
known than it should be, especially in these days 
when everyone is supposed to have some interest in 
the subject which it treats. The modem quality 
of Aristotle's mind appears not least in his Psy- 
chology ; and one who approaches it simply out of 
cariosity, or for its historical value, is likely to find 
that he still has something to learn from a compar- 
ison with modern psychological results of this ear- 
liest attempt to svstematiz.e the facts of the mental 
life. ' 

1 itmii If "^^^ years after his death, Phillips 

tk» wtetmTf tf Brooks is still a living power in the 
'***"■>• **^ world. On the twenty-third of Jan- 
nary, Trinity Church was crowded with bishops^ 
clergy, and representative citizens, assembled to 
pay tribute to his memory. The commemorative 
address, delivered by his successor in the bishopric, 
Dr. Lawrence, is now published under the title^ 
" Phillips Brooks, a Study " (Houghton). The sub- 
ject is, of coarse, too vast for the limits of a short 
oration ; but the speaker makes happy choice of a 
few leading characteristics of the great preacher. 
Three of his contributions to the religious thoaght 
of the day are dwelt upon. First, he taught the 
essential unity of the ani verse, — God, man, aad na- 
ture, inextricably intervoven into a living organism 
working out God's purpose. Secondly, he had con- 
fidence in God as the God of truth, and apprehended 
no conflict between science and religion. Thirdly, 
he preached the naturalness and healthiness of tbe 
religious life, and the divine sonsbip of man. The 
author is [perhaps a little over-emphatic in making 
Dr. Brooks the great incolcator and expounder of 
the divinity that is in humanity, forgetting that this 
was Channing's constant theme. Appropriate em- 
phasis is placed upon Phillips Brooks's entire free- 
dom from narrowness, and his consequent influence 
far beyond the limits of his sect. His printed works 
have obtained a wider circulation than one might 
Bapp>ose. More than two hundred thousand copies 
of his sermons and other writings, we are told, are 
in the hands of the people. Tet he was the very 
last man to be touched with any pride of authorship.

A valaable addition to the literature 
of missions comes from tbe press of 
Messrs. A. C. Armstrong & Son, in 
a volume entitled " John Mackenzie, South African 
Missionary and Statesman." written by his son. 
Prof. W. D. Mackenzie, of Chicago Theological 
Seminary. It is the life-record of a sturdy, practi- 
cal, broad-minded Scotchman, who for more than 
forty years, from 1S58 to,1899, labored incessantly

for the welfare of South Africa and her people. At 
first in charge of a local station, he soon came to 
see what an important bearing the politics of the 
country had upon mission work, and did not hesi- 
tate to take a hand in public affairs. South African 
politics is nothing if not strenuous, and he plunged 
into it with characteristic earnestness. He was an 
ardent Imperialist, and believed the British govern- 
ment should drop its vacillating policy and assume 
control of affairs with a firm hand. Naturally the 
attention of the authorities was drawn to him, and 
in course of time he was appointed Deputy Com- 
missioner for South Africa. Here was the oppor- 
tunity to put in practice his theories of political 
reform, and he made a brave attempt to do it. He 
at once, however, encountered fierce opposition. 
The success of his plans would mean the failure of 
those of the land-grabbers and schemers of all kinds. 
It was a battle-royal between honesty and right- 
eousness on the one band, and greed and selfishness 
on the other. The latter won, temporarily at least, 
and Mackenzie went back to his mission work. The 
whole account is of much interest, especially in view 
of what has since taken place in South Africa. 

Those who know their London well, 

irl^AXt ""'I 1»^« it' ^i" keenly enjoy Mrs. 
E. T. Cook's " Highways and By- 
ways in London" (Macmillan). A happy ming- 
ling of historical, literary, and descriptive matter, 
all enlivened with excellent drawings by Messrs. 
Hugh Thomson and F. L. Griggs, makes the book 
a most attractive one to the booklover and the 
recluse, as well as to the tourist. Though London 
was called by Cobbett " the great wen," by Grant 
Allen " a squalid village," by Madame de Stael 
" a province in brick," and all agree in regarding 
it as an ugly city, its ugliness is picturesque and 
even its grime is needed to tone down and harmon- 
ize the whole. The author regrets, and with reason, 
the spread of the big hotel and apartment house, 
so aggressively modern in their appearance. An 
amusing derivation of the word " cockney " is 
quoted from " an old writer." "A Cittizen's Sonne 
riding with his father into the Country, asked 
when he heard a horse neigh, what the horse did ; 
his father answered, the horse doth neigh ; riding 
further he heard a cocke crow, and said, doth the 
cocke neigh too? and therefore Cockney or Cock- 
nie, by inversion thus: incock, q. incootus, i., raw or 
unripe in Country-man's affaires." 

" The Quest of the Holy Grail " is 
^7HVL'oterl the title of a beautifully illustrated 

monograph issued by Messrs. Curtis 
& Cameron, and treating the Grail legend with 
special reference to Mr. Edwin A. Abbey's wall- 
paintings in the Boston Public Library. Dr. Ferris 
Greenslet, the author of the test, introduces his 
interpretations of Mr. Abbey's friezes with three 
chapters of wider scope. These discuss the sym- 
bolism of the Grail, trace the growth of the legend 



through old romances and modern poems, and finally 
explain how it is treated by Mr. Abbey. Fifteen 
short chapters follow, each narrating the incident 
which is the subject of one frieze panel. All of 
the fifteen panels are reproduced in full-page tinted 
illustrations ; and there are, besides, eleven very 
interesting studies of detail. The book is finely 
printed on Ruisdale paper and artistically bound 
in linen covers. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



We have received from Mr. Howard Wilford Bell, 
London, a collection of interesting booklets. " Uni- 
versity Magazines and their Makers," by Mr. Harry 
Cnrrie Marillier, is a paper read before a literary so- 
ciety, and has a valuable bibliographical appendix. 
" Some Impressions of Oxford " is a translation by Mr. 
M. C. Warrilow of an essay by M. Paul Bourget, 
and has some pretty illustrations. " Quatrains from 
Omar Khayyam " are an even two dozen of the rubaiyat 
done into English, with an introductory essay, by Pro- 
fessor F. York Powell. These verses were first printed 
in " The Pageant " six years ago, and are now given a 
more permanent form because " they have been im- 
pudently misprinted by a pirate in the United States, 
where the laws as yet permit such dishonest and un- 
civil dealings." The last of these booklets, entitled 
"All's Well," is a selection of "optimistic thoughts 
from the writings of Robert Browning," made by Mr. 
Graham Hope. 

" Macbeth " was the second volume in the " Vari- 
orum " Shakespeare of Dr. Furness, and was published 
thirty years ago. It is now issued by the Messrs. 
Lippincott in a revised edition which has been mainly 
prepared by the son of the veteran editor, Mr. H. H. 
Furness, Jr. Concerning which apostolic succession, 
we may quote the words of the elder editor: "Surely, 
the instances are not many where a literary task begun 
by a father is taken up and carried forward by a son; 
still fewer are they where a father can retire within the 
shadow with such conviction, as is now mine, that the 
younger hands are the better hands, and that the work 
will be done more deftly in the future than in the past." 
Recent modern language texts include the following: 
The American Book Co. publish the " Marianela " of 
Senor Galdos, edited by Mr. Edward Gray, Lessing's 
" Nathan der Weise," edited by Professor Tobias J. C. 
Diekhoff, and M. Pierre Foncin's " Le Pays de France," 
edited by M. Antoine Muzzarelli. Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. publish Racine's " Andromaque," " Britannicus," 
and " Athalie," all in one volume edited by Professor 
F. M. Warren, and Herr Fulda's " Der Talisman," 
edited by Professor Edward S. Meyer. Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. publish Corneille's "Cinna," edited by 
Professor John E. Matzke, and Herr von Liliencron's 
" Anno 1870," edited by Dr. Wilhelm Bernhardt. 

We have received from the Mississippi Historical 
Society the sixth annual volume of its valuable "Publica- 
tions," edited by Secretary Franklin L. Riley. The con- 
tents are too miscellaneous to be summarized iu a para- 
graph, but we can testify to the scholarly activity which 
they betoken and to the interest of many of the papers. 
We note particularly a lengthy essay on " Suffrage 
and Reconstruction in Mississippi," by Mr. Frank 
Johnston.

A " Julia Marlowe " edition of Mr. G. W. Cable's

This means that the novel is provided with pictures 
representing Miss Marlowe in the character of the

To the " Dowden Shakespeare," published by the 
Bowen-Merrill Co., the " Othello " volume, edited by 
Mr. H. C. Hart, has just been added. The play is 
provided with an introduction of some length, and 
abundant notes. 

The book of the " Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Si-

by Professor N. Schmidt, is published by the Messrs. 
Idppincott as the first volume of an " Apocrypha " uni-

Maeanlay's " Lays of Ancient Rome " and Crabbe's 
*• The Borough" form the contents of two recent vol- 
ames in the "Temple Classics" series (Dent-Macmil-

are the respective editors of the two editions. 

Beaumont and Fletcher's " Knight of the Burning 
Pestle " has reeently been produced in Elizabethan 
style by the English Club of Stanford f niversity, and 
Messrs. Elder & Shepard of San Francisco have sent 
OS a booklet, " On Seeing an Elizabethan Play," pre- 
pared by way of explanation and comment. 

" Epoch- Making Papers in United States History," 
edited by Mr. Marshall Stewart Brown, is a << Pocket 
Classic " from the Macmillan Co. The selection of pa- 
pers is excellent, including not only the fundamental 
ones, but also a series illustrative of the slavery quw- 
tioo from the Miasoori Compromise to the Emancipa- 
tion Proclamation. 

The American Book Co. send us " Barnes's Sehool 
History of the United States," thoroughly revised by 
Mr. Joel Dorman Steele and Miss Esther Baker Steele. 
We also have a copy of " Barnes's Elementary His- 
tory of the United Stales," completely rewritten in the 
form of a series of biographies by Mr. James Baldwia. 
Both books are abundantly illustrated. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., are the publishers 
of a work on " Practical Physiology," prodaoed by the 
ooUaboration of Messrs. A. P. Beddard, Leonard Hill, 
J. S. Edkins, J. J. R. Macleod, and M. S. Pembray, aU 
practical teachers of the subject in the London hos- 
pitals. It is essentially a laboratory treatise ; designed 
for the use of both students and practitioners. 

Messrs. Rector K. Fox and Pitts Duffield are the 
heads of a firm lately incorporated to engage in a gen- 
eral publishing business in New York City under the

recorded by Mr. Hntehins Hapgood. 

A happv thought in sehool reading books is em- 
bodied in' Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co.'s charming 
pictorial edition of "A Child's Garden of Verses." 
Here we have a text that eaa he used with absolute 
satisfaction in the primary grades, and it is accompa- 
nied by a series of illustrations (including ten colored 
plates), by Miss E. Mars and Miss M. H. Squire, that 
greatly enhance the attractiveness of the book. 

It is not often that popular success is achieved by a 
publication so presumably "heavy" in contents as a 
quarterly review of religion, theology, and philosophy ; 
yet the new " Hibbert Journal " seems to have attained 
this distinction. Xot less than four editions of the 
first number were required; the unexpected demand in- 
volving the resetting of the entire number, as the type 
had been distributed after the first impressions. 

The three latest volumes in the Dent-Macmillan edi- 
tion of Thackeray's prose works are occupied with the 
miscellaneous writings, comprising the " English Hu- 
morists " and " Four Georges" in one volume, and the 
Paris and Irish Sketch-books. Each volume has a front- 
ispiece portrait in photogravure and a number of Mr. 
Charles E. Brock's clever drawings. Mr. Walter Jer- 
rold's bibliographical introductions are, as nsoal, both 
interesting and to the point. 

Hiram M. SUnley, for fifteen yean associated with

^ the same approval from educators as did its predeces- 
sor. It will be found equally useful on account of Mr. 
Cody's general introduction, and his historical and 
critical introduction to each essay. These, together with 
the selections, illustrate perfectly the history of English 
prose style. The ten writers whose essays are used are 
Addison, Bacon, Carlyle, DeQuincey, Emerson, Arnold, 
Lamb, Swift, Macaulay, and Ruskin.

The Path of Evolution 



Through Ancient Thought and Modern 
Science 

By HENRY PEMBERTON 

Member of American Philosophical Society, Academy of 

Natural Sciences, Historical Society 

of Pennsylvania, etc, 

A comprehensive survey of philosophy and 
learning, illumined by a wonderfully lucid and 
simple style; a treatment of the evolution of 
knowledge and the evolution of life, establishing 
a connected historical relation, and applying the 
deductions of science to the problems of life. A 
thoughtful book that gives easy grasp of a diffi- 
cult study. 

The author has sketched the story of the progress of 
hnman knowledge in many different lines. . . . He has 
read widely and thought wisely. — Outlook, New York. 

One of the most snccessfnl attempts ever made to 
popularize the conclusions reached by scientists and 
philosophers in the various fields of hnman inquiry. . . , 
Singular clearness of exposition. , . . Studious avoidance 
of technical language. — Sun, New York, 



It admirably supplements the writings of Herbert 
Spencer, John Fiske, and others, with masterful grasp and 
intelligence. The style is clear, concise, and digni6ed, as 
befita BO grave a subject. — Public Ledger, Philadelphia. 

The subject is phrased in such a simple style that the 
large class of people outride the circle of scientists can 
comprehend it. — Pott, Washington, D. C. 

The book impresses one as being thoroughly compre- 
hensive . . . lucid, and pleasant to read. — Commerciai- 
Advertiter, New York. 

Mr. Pemberton throws light on the things which are 
intangible and remote, but which all classes of mankind 
are interested in. — Globe-Democrat, St. Louis. 

His purpose is to enable us to steer clear of positivism, 
agnosticism, and materialism, and to discern amid all . . . 
a wise, intelligent volition. — Free Press, Detroit, Mich, 

His work contains an immense amount of information, 
but more important are the conclusions he comes to. . , , 
His view is broad, hopeful, helpful, and attractive in 
style. — Evening Telegraph, Philadelphia. 

In many respects the most Important book of many 
months. . . . Those who want to know what scientists 
claim at present will find it better set forth here than in any 
other work of which we have knowledge. . . . All will 
find it a work of intense interest. — Inquirer, Philadelphia.

The Traitors 

By E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM 



WHAT OTHERS SAY 



From a review by Harry 
Thurston Peck: 

"If you are going on a few hours' 
journey and wish something to read, 
buy 'The Traitors,' by E. PhUlips 
Oppenheiui. The book is really ab- 
sorbing in its interest. The main ac- 
tion centers around the clever 
plotting of a Russian diplomat, 
the still cleverer counterplotting

of an English jom-nalist, the fortunes 
of a soldier king, the jealousy of a high- 
born woman, and the love of an Ameri- 
can g^rl. The story is told with a swing 
and a sweep most exhilarating." 

San Francisco Chronicle: 

" Tliis novel is of a kind which per- 
mits much action. The author 
has taken advantage of his op- 
portunities in this line." 



WHA T IT IS 

The story is a bright and graphic account of 
just such stirring events as are taking place 
to-day in. the Balkans. This historical back- 
ground forms a remarkable setting for a no less 
interesting love story, which has for one of its 
chief characters a lovable American girl, who 
becomes the queen of Theos. 



From the Brooklyn 
Eagle : 



" ' The Traitors ' is a brilliant romance. 
It gets fairly close to historical reality. 
Its episodes are thrilling, its dialogue 
crisp, and its diplomatic intrigue beauti- 
fully complicated. Quite a brisk story, 
which people will enjoy."

Reflections 

OF A 

Lonely Man 

By "A. CM." 

A DELIGHTFUL little book of 
fireside philosophy that is so 
attractively written, and in such 
close touch with everyday mat- 
ters, that it will appeal to men 
and women alike. Given a man 
of clear alert mind ; put him 
before an open fire in a com- 
fortable chair, and he is likely 
to offer some ideas and theories 
worth listening to. To dis- 
course amid such surroundings 
has been a favorite tendency of 
several philosophers. "It is 
well to think one's own thoughts 
occasionally, even though they 
be wrong," the Lonely Man 
says, and the average reader 
will find these reflections so hu- 
man, so pertinent, and in such 
close touch with every-day life, 
that he will add that it is equally 
worth while to write them out 
for the benefit of others.

FOUR HARPER BOOKS 



The Bishop 

By CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY. 

Stories of a militant, lovable bishop, whose 
work among the rough-and-ready men of 
Western camps, forts, and villages results 
in his sharing in many incidents of frontier 
life — comedy, tragedy, always drama. He 
is a distinct American product, planted by 
the Church and grown in Western soil. 
His life is full of activity of the best kind, 
and he is a man you have to respect. He 
has many experiences, some amusing, some 
thrilling, and these stories afford excellent pic- 
tures of life in the roughest parts of the West. 

Illustrated by JV. T. Smedley, E. M. Ashe, 
and Others. Ornamented cloth, $1-50 



Wee Macgreegor 

By JAMES JOY BELL 

Mr. Bell has admirably told the humorous 
and realistic story of a little Scottish boy 
Wee Macgreegor, of his father, who slyly 
pets and spoils him, and of his mother, who 
adores and disciplines him — three unforget- 
able people who live actually before us in 
the author's exquisite and sincere work. 

It is a unique contribution to modern 
literature, and comes as a real surprise to the 
Scotch, English, and American public. The 
book has taken England by storm, and has 
made the fortune of its young author.

The Triumph of Life 

By WILLIAM FARQUHAR PAYSON 
Author of " John Vytal" 

A Story of modern American life. It tells 
of the struggles of a young writer, Enoch 
Lloyd, with what seems to be financial suc- 
cess at the price of moral failure. There 
are two women in the case, the two opposing 
influences. One is Celeste Moreau, the 
worldly, mocking daughter of a French 
hotel-keeper in New York -, the other is 
Marion Lee, daughter of Lloyd's publisher. 
His struggle between these two influences 

— the one demoralizing, the other ennobling 

— is worked out through many intricacies of 
plot,and a series of intense dramatic situations. 

Ornamented cloth, $1.^0 



Marjorie 

(Imprint of R. H. Russell) 

By JUSTIN HUNTLY MCCARTHY 
Author of "If I fTere King'' 

This story, by the author of that popular 
book, " If I Were King," is romantic in 
nature, and deals with daring adventure of a 
piratically inclined expedition which started 
to establish a colony in the West Indies. 
Life, vitality, action, and splendid color en- 
liven the pages, and make stormy the course 
of a dainty love story. Mr. McCarthy is 
master of an exquisite literary stvle that 
places his novels in a class by themselves. 

A frontispiece in colors, by C. Allan 
Gilbert, six full-page illustrations, decorated 
end-papers, etc., make the book as delightful 
to look at as to read.

12mo. Cloth, $2.00 net ; postage additional. 
M. Lavignac's book is written in a scholarly as well as a simple style, that makes it at once convinc- 
ing, authoritative, and useful to the student and the accomplished musician. This book is an inquiry into 
" the best means to pursue a musical education under its most healthful conditions — a matter which is 
far more difficult than is generally believed." The advice which it contains will be invaluable to parents, 
amateur and professional musicians, teachers, and students, and is " the fruit of forty years' experience in 
teaching nearly every degree of talent and every condition of life." The real object of the work, to quote 
from M. Lavignac again, is to set forth " the best manner to pm-sue any study in order to reach the end 
that one desires to attain."

A MASTE R OF MAXIMS. 

It is often difficult to fix the genre of a mas- 
ter of the human spirit who uses words as his 
tools of work. Edmund Burke, comparing him- 
self with his friends of the Literary Club, mod- 
estly disclaimed the title of " man of letters." 
And in the main he was right. All his vast 
knowledge, and world-sweeping thought, and 
processional train of rich-apparelled words, 
were set to the service of politics, — given up 
to expounding the art of governing mankind. 
The ethical writer is as sadly to seek in pure 
literature as the political one. Literature of 
itself is disinterested. It has no axe to grind. 
It proposes no material, or even spiritual, end. 
It is simply a report of the universe and man- 
kind as they are. or a vision of them as they 
are dreamed to be. It is a second creation, 
hardly less real than the first. Compared witl^ 
the poet and philosopher, the ethical and di- 
dactic writer is as a sign-post which gives the 
direction, to the landscape about it. 

It may be a more important thing to rule or 
reform men than to reproduce them in art, — 
to give birth, that is, not to beings, of brief 
date, but to images of immortality. But it is 
certainly a different thing ; and when the writer 
on conduct or affairs seeks to take his place in 
literature, he must be content to rank as second- 
rate. In the muster-rolls of Greek and Latin 
literature, what place has Epictetus or Marcus 
Aurelius ? The great discs of Homer and Plato, 
Virgil and Lucretius, occult their tiny lamps 
or dim them in a day of glory. In the end, a 
writer of books must be judged by the canons 
of literature. This is becoming true even of 
the great religious documents of the world 
— its Bibles. How much more must it be 
the case with books which make no claim to be 
inspired I 

It is an honorable feature in human charac- 
ter that it craves to be led and guided toward 
the right. The didactic writer always has his 
work cut out for him, and is assured of {)ower 
and influence. But prophet succeeds prophet ; 
and, once past, oblivion yawns for most of them. 
For one thing, axioms, as Keats said, are not 
axioms until they have been proved upon our 



294 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



pulses. They have a way of turning out half- 
truths, or no truths at all, as circumstances alter. 
They are mutually contradictory. If all the 
maxims and proverbial sayings of the world 
were brought together, they would destroy each 
other like a roomful of Kilkenny cats. Human 
nature is too profound and mysterious to be 
bound up in a code of short sayings. The great 
philosophies and poems of the world exist on 
an entirely different plane. The first may be 
unprovable, and the second untrue : the first 
may merely illuminate the walls of our prison- 
house, and the second may deal with impossible 
creations, — gods, and demons, and superhu- 
man men. But what matters that? They are 
great imaginations, to which we must return 
again and again for exaltation and refreshment. 
Side by side with the world of reality exists this 
phantom world ; and the man who succeeds in 
extending it, or adding to its population, takes, 
humanly speaking, the highest place. Lit- 
erature teaches also — but it teaches not by 
the cold, inert method of precept, but by the 
vivid and vital force of example. Achilles 
moulded all antiquity to his own image and 
Hamlet has cast his shadow on the whole of 
modern life. 

Critics are often accused of ingratitude in 
dealing with great men. If these bring us 
good gifts, it is said, let us humbly accept 
them, and not stop to investigate their value 
or cost. But always with criticism there are 
present the questions of precedence and perma- 
nence. Who is entitled to the crown ? and 
which wreath is of unfading amaranth? In 
the case of Emerson, there is much to confuse 
American criticism. Respect for his lofty 
character, local loyalty, gratitude for guidance 
in a great National crisis, — all these things 
make him loom large in our eyes. He did 
many things, but essentially he is a teacher — 
a preacher. His works are the sublimed es- 
sence of a myriad of New England sermons. 
He was a maker of moral maxims ; a teacher 
of conduct. In some moods, he said, the verse 
of Shakespeare would sound like the tinkling 
of tin pans. He said also that his own effort 
was always to discard the wrappings of things 
and to get at their innermost secret. He pre- 
ferred to put his hand on the seed of the tree, 
rather than to enjoy its full growth and efflor- 
escence. In this, his instinct was the opposite 
of the true poet, who desires to multiply phe- 
nomena and to envisage the whole mass of 
life. His effort was always the effort of the 



maxim-maker to condense all experience into 
a phrase. 

There are two traditional incidents in the 
history of philosophy, which come to mind in 
thinking of Emerson : one, the meeting of the 
young Socrates with Parmenides ; the other, 
the interview between the equally youthful 
Confucius and the ancient master of mystery 
and mysticism Lao Tsze. In both cases the re- 
sult was apparently the same. The old men 
listened with an ironic smile to the clear, con- 
fident, everyday wisdom of the new teachers of 
conduct and morals. Something like this may 
well have happened at the first meeting of 
Carlyle and Emerson. Emerson is our village 
Socrates. He has a wise word for all men's 
daily needs. He admonishes and helps. But 
compared with the cloudy, lightning-fulgent 
Carlyle, he is trivial and shallow and prosaic. 

Emerson's essays are full of allusions to 
philosophy. Plato and Zoroaster and the Rig 
Veda do business at the old stand on almost 
every other page. Yet one doubts whether he 
was really capable of forming a metaphysical 
concept. He could never concentrate his 
thoughts long enough on one subject to do so. 
He scorns logic and cohesion. His sentences 
are a heap of glittering particles that run 
through one's fingers. Hence his baffling 
quality. There is no founding anything on 
him. He is a veritable quicksand of an author. 
Nearly every great thinker has some central 
thought fixed firm against all shifting tides 
and winds. The central thought of Plato is 
the theory of Ideas, — the assertion of the 
apparition al character of the seemingly real 
world. The central thought of Pascal is that 
of Human Intelligence confronting the Uni- 
verse and strangled by it like Laoeoon in the 
inexorable coils of the snake. The central 
thought of Schopenhauer is the absurdity of 
life. We know where to have these writers, — 
but Emerson we never know. He chops and 
changes with every book he has been reading, 
or with every reader he desires to mould. Like 
Polonius, he is willing to agree that the cloud 
may be a camel, or a whale, or a weasel. And 
he is never thorough, in Strafford's sense of 
the word. He writes you about the scholar or 
the poet, — and the strain rises like a stream 
of rich distilled perfume ; but then it occurs 
to him that the butcher, the baker, and the can- 
dlestick-maker are also vertebrate animals, and 
have a certain reason for being, and he gives 
you their Apotheosis. What he was after, all

bis life, was practicable idealism. But prac- 
ticable idealism is a contradiction in terms, 
and sacrifices both the ideal and the practical. 

It seems like flying in the face of Providence, 
to repine at onr luck in having a writer who 
is filled with a sense of the brightness of things, 
— who believes only in the best in human na- 
ture. But there is a lack of reality in the op- 
timistic view. Emerson reminds one of the 
artist who was commissioned to paint a picture 
of the crossing of the Red Sea. When he ex- 
hibited his canvas it was merely one expanse 
of red paint. " Why," said his patron, " where 
are the Israelites and Egyptians ?" " Oh," 
answered the artist, " the Israelites have crossed 
over, and the Egyptians are all drowned." In 
Emerson's books, human nature has passed on, 
or is hidden in a field of tenuous light. 

Three, at least, of Emerson's English con- 
temporaries must dispute with him the primacy 
in spiritual and ethical thought. They are 
Carlyle, Newman, and Huskin. Carlyle is out 
of all measure the largest of the group. He 
was half artist, half moralist. If in his capacity 
of moralist his heart was full of angry dis- 
dain of the pernicious race of mortals '* mostly 
fools," as an artist he could take delight in 
their weakness and waywardness. He had the 
artist's love of deep shadows ; and the darkness 
of the gloomy masses of mankind was all the 
more welcome to him in that it served to set 
off the splendor of the few great heroic figures 
whom he wholly loved. Emerson was Carlyle's 
pupil. He reproduced him, but he reproduced 
him as a photographic negative does — revers- 
ing all the lights and shades. Like a good 
witch, he reads the spell backwards : and a lovely 
fairy appears where before was an hideous hob- 
goblin. He turns all Carlyle's roughness to 
favor and to prettiness, and out of his welter- 
ing chaos made a really charming world where 
nice people can walk up and down. But when 
one of Homer's heroes, hard pressed, calls for 
superhuman aid, the god comes to him in a 
cloud, — and with the cloud withdraws the god. 

Cardinal Newman, bottomed on faith and 
authority, is a sure refuge to many who tire of 
Carlyle's stormy frowns, and who find no 
strength in Emerson's smiling cheerfulness. 
Like Carlyle he is melancholy ; but his mel- 
ancholy is full of beauty, — 

" Elysian beauty, melancboly grace, 
Brought from a pensive tho' a happy place." 

Even Newman's style is midway between the 



two. If he has no sentences with the arrowy 
keenness of Emerson, and no passages with the 
sunset splendor of Carlyle, he has pages and 
chapters of more perfect and even excellence 
than either, and when all were fighting over 
questions of ethics and morals, his message to 
mankind, — that it should believe in a Church 
in which so many and such mighty minds have 
believed, — has immense practical utility. 

Ruskin is the least original of this group of 
latter-day prophets. But his pictured style out- 
glows any prose the others have wrought ; and 
the ardor with which be championed every 
spiritual cause, the earnestness with which he 
descended into every arena, the self-sacrifice 
which drove him into the back-alleys of the 
world, — these make him the most missionary 
spirit of them all. 

There remains for me to say something of 
Emerson's poetry. As in Arnold's case, the 
Muse can defend her son. In the last analysis, 
when we have driven off the thin vapors of his 
eclectic borrowings and withdrawn the fluid 
gold of his prose maxims, there is left a res- 
iduum of indestructible crystals of verse. They 
are the tiniest and most fragmentary crystals 
ever produced by a considerable poet ; but they 
flash with the white light of the diamond. Im- 
agination failed him, the plastic gift failed him, 
in pieces of any length ; but there are a score 
or two of phrases, lines, quatrains, fragments, 
which have a verbal felicity hardly equaled 
elsewhere in American poetry. 

" Oh, tenderly the haughty day 
FiUs its blue urn with fire," — 

That is style, new, nniqae, and as good as the 
best. 

Emerson, on the whole, seems to me an odd 
combination of the natures of St. Francis 
and Benjamin Franklin, — which type appears 
somehow suited to our American ideals. His 
spirituality is a corrective to our materialism, 
and his canniness a compliment to it. But he 
can never be satisfactory to the imaginative or 
the logical mind. He has not the energy, or 
the richness, or the profundity, to appeal to 
those who have fed upon the great poets and 
philosophers. He was a purveyor of first-lessons 
in philosophy, and of proverbial rules of life for 
intellectual children. He may keep an audience 
of these to the end; or they may seek other 
masters. But great men will pass him by with 
but a slight salute.

THE MORALITY PLAY IN THE BE VEL- 
OPMENT OF ENGLISH DRAMA. 



In very many senses, this time in which we are 
living is a period of looking backward. All through 
the latter half of the nineteenth century, interest 
hag been increasing in the things of long ago. Aa 
the people of the fifteenth century found Antiquity, 
80 we moderns have been discovering the Middle 
Ages. Our passion for the Gothic, our interest in 
handicraft, our love of folk-song, our admiration for 
Pre-Raphaelite art, all attest this revival. No won- 
der, then, that the presentation of the fifteenth 
century play " Everyman " has aroused, first in 
London, then in New York, Boston, and Chicago, 
the greatest enthusiasm. 

" Everyman " belongs to that class of pseudo 
dramas, called Moralities, that developed when the 
popular religious plays, known as Mysteries or Mir- 
acles, were approaching their decadence. Imported 
from French monasteries by the Normans who came 
into England with the Conquest, they soon took firm 
hold upon English life. At first they were a part 
of the liturgical ceremony of the church. On great 
feast days, and especially at Christmas and Easter, 
a simple dramatic representation was introduced 
into the service, priests and choristers taking the 
parts. Gradually these strictly liturgical Mysteries 
gave place to more elaborate productions, which 
were detached from the office, though still per- 
formed in the churches ; the vernacular was sub- 
stituted for Latin ; whole series of Mysteries were 
joined together into a single work. Then, needing 
of course more room for presentation, they were 
taken outside of the churches to the steps and grave- 
yards, and finally away from them altogether. 

During this process of secularization, the laity, 
serving first for chorus, — as for instance, the rab- 
ble before the court of Pontius Pilate, — had come 
to take the principal roles, and at last to produce 
the entire play. While in Chaucer's lifetime both 
clergy and laity were actors, it was not long after his 
death (1400) that the participation of the clergy was 
forbidden. Through the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries, the Miracles were performed chiefly by 
the Gilds of the towns at their out-of-door Corpus 
Christi festivals. In the hands of the Gilds they 
developed into great cycles of plays, of which those 
of York, Townly, Chester, and Coventry are the 
most famous. These cycles told the Scripture story 
from the Creation to the Day of Judgment, and re- 
quired usually three days for their presentation. To 
each Gild was entrusted permanently the perform- 
ance of one part of the series, — for instance, to 
the shipbuilders the episode of Noah and the Ark, 
to the goldsmiths the Adoration of the Three Kings, 
to the smiths the Crucifixion ; and of course the 
societies vied with each other in the splendor of the 
production. Movable platforms called pageants, 
upon each of which one act in the drama was pre- 
sented, were dragged from point to point about the 



town and showed in their proper order to the spec- 
tators. Heaven, Earth, and Hell were set forth on 
three different elevations of the stage, with naive 
simplicity, but, in the case of Hell especially, with 
awful realism. The grotesquely-clad imps and 
devils who ran in and out of Hell's mouth, and 
teased the other actors and the spectators, repre- 
sented a comedy element ; and humorous episodes 
having to do with the lesser Scriptural characters, 
such as Pilate's wife and the torturers of Jesus, 
further relieved the strain of the more intense parts 
of the drama. 

In some such form as this the miracles continued 
to be played till the early part of the seventeenth 
century. Alongside them for more than a century 
existed plays which, instead of telling simply the 
Biblical story in dramatic form, aimed to enforce 
a moral truth directly by means of personified ab- 
stractions of the virtues and vices. These dramas 
were called Moralities. Such dramatis personw as 
Envy, Charity, Good Deeds, Intemperance, woven 
into an imaginary tale or popular legend, made up 
the Morality. Though traces of personification of 
abstract ideas are found in some of the old Mir- 
acles, and two plays not now extant, written in the 
fourteenth century, were supposed to be of the na- 
ture of Moralities, there is no positive evidence of 
a Morality proper before the fifteenth century. 
Probably they grew out of the Miracles, and sup- 
plemented them. Certainly they followed the older 
drama closely in manner and method of presenta- 
tion, using the same pageants, the same three ele- 
vations of the stage, the same style of costuming, 
and the same comedy effects. 

Something in the English mind and disposition 
seems particularly favorable to Allegory ; hence the 
Moralities flourished with the greatest luxuriance 
on English soil. A large number of them are still 
extant, of which " The Castell of Perseverance," 
composed in Henry the Sixth's time, is the earliest, 
and " Everyman," thought to have been written by 
a Dutch priest in the latter half of the fifteenth 
century, is " the flower and crown." Unlike the 
Miracle plays, the Moralities were in touch with the 
age that produced them. Thinkers found in them 
a splendid opportunity for direct treatment of 
moral, social, and political problems. It was in the 
Reformation age under the Tudors that the Mor- 
ality attained its greatest influence and popularity. 
" Nature " and " The World and the Child " are 
early Tudor plays. " The Lusty Juventus," written 
in Edward the Sixth's time, shows the influence of 
the Reformation, while " The Interlude of Youth " 
indicates the Catholic reaction under Mary. Two 
non-religious Moralities, " The Nature of the Four 
Elements" and " Wyt and Science," written in 
praise of learning, point to the emergence of the 
renaissance spirit. 

Although the Morality was in the main abstract 
in character, dealing with pure personifications, it 
was not without concrete and comic elements, which, 
as they developed, brought it to the very threshold 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

of comedy. The chief of these was the Vice, after- 
wards transformed into the Jester or Fool of ElizA- 
bethan plays. The Vice, originally an attendant of 
the Devil, gradaally became an independent char- 
acter upon whom the aathor exercised his originality 
and wit. It is the fan and mad pranks of the Vice 
that sagared the pill of the moral lesson to the au- 
dience and saved many of these allegories from 
hopeless dalness. The authors of Moralities gave 
a coloring of reality also by allnding to the actual 
world aroand the audience, placing the action in 
the streets and places they knew. Sometimes, too, 
in place of abstract appellations, sach as Idleness, 
Folly, Enmity, specific names were given to the 
characters, who thas became more human. In 
" Like wil to Like quod the Devel to the Colier," 

— a Morality full of boisterous fun and of moral- 
izings upon the pernicious results of riotous living, 

— the persons are called Nichol Newfangle, Ralph 
Roister. Tom Tosspot, and Hankin Hangman. If 
not individuals, at least social types were evolved. 

While the Morality through the sixteenth century 
was developing in the direction of concreteness and 
humor, another dramatic form destined to influence 
its future, was taking shape beside it. Since Plan- 
tagenet times, kings had employed troops of pro- 
fessional actors, or mimes, who composed for the en- 
tertainment of the court various sorts of mummeries 
and humorous dramatized anecdotes or farces. 
These one-act plays were called Interludes, from 
the fact that they were played in the intervals be- 
tween courses at public banquets. Now it remained 
for some genius to combine these airy nothings with 
the more highly-developed and serious moralities. 
To John Heywood, one of the •' singers '' in the 
household of Henry the Eighth, belongs the credit 
of having accomplished this. It is to plays of the 
type of his, — a cross between the early Interlude 
and the Morality proper. — that the name Interlude 
is usually applied in the history of literature. His 
little skits. — "The Mery Play between the Par- 
doner and the Frere," '• The Four P's. or Mery 
Interlude between the Palmer, the Pardoner, the 
Potycary. and the Pedlar,' " The Dialogue of Wit 
and Folly." and the rest, — are full of freshness, of 
vigor, and of animation. They show an undeniable 
sense of humor, and, above aJl, power of drawing 
successfully individual characters taken from actu^ 
life. They are more than mere entertainments, for 
with the liveliest wit they attack the abuses of the 
time. Though Heywood cannot be called the creator 
of English comedy, the type of play he developed 
exhibited many of its essential qualities. 

In the form of Interlude, the Morality survived 
into the seventeenth century, and became '"one of 
the threads which went to make up the wondrous web 
of the Elizabethan drama." It would seem an easy 
step from Interlude to Comedy proper ; yet another 
element must needs be added before this still form- 
less dramatic species could be converted into legit- 
imate drama. This was supplied by the study of 
Plantns and Terence, and of the Italian dramatists 



whom the Renaissance, coming tardily into En- 
gland, had introduced to the scholars. Then at last 
the seed which had been planted in good ground 
burst into flower and brought forth the Shakes- 
pearian harvest Florence H. Haktet.

THE '• EVERLASTING PYRAMIDS." 
( To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 

Moch has been written about the Pyramids of 
Gizeh; abundance of description, statistics, and of the 
wonder and admiration excited by them. But during 
a recent visit, I came to a thought abaut them that had 
not been in my mind before. I think I shall never again 
use the eomparison, " As everlasting as the Pyramids." 
The piles of debris on every side of the Great Pyramid, 
called " of Cheops," suggested the question, " Whence 
came those heaps ? " There they rested against the huge 
slopes, forty or fifty feet higher than the general level 
on which we walked or rode around; and that level is 
above the original foundation as discovered and settled 
by Vyse and others. 

Evidently the answer to the question is, " From the 
pyramid itself." It is made of a friable limestone, and 
is perpetually losing some substance. Numerous blocks 
lie around that have fallen because the stones under 
them have been so soft as to give way under pressure 
and weathering, and to allow the superincumbent one 
t« roll down. I did not try climbing the pyramid; but a 
field-glass detected easily many of these rotting stones. 
At the southeast comer I stepped up to a stone to 
measure it ; I saw that the one under it was so soft that 
I could easily with my cane have detached from it 
four or five pounds of the rock. I did not do it: a light 
touch showed what could be done. There aie at Sakkara 
and elsewhere piles of debris that once were pyramids. 

I do not advise any one to hurry to Egypt to see the 
pvramid before it goes to pieces ; there is enough to 
last many thousand years more : I do but record the 
feeling of ruin of the monument in aeeordanee with all 
else in Egypt. I found it easy to step upon the back of 
the Sphinx ; bat as I walked toward the bead I came 
upon a transrene fissore three feet wide and equally 
deep, extending down the sides, I did not see how far. 
In the neck of the image I noticed that some strata are 
softer than others, and ate more rapidly cat away by 
the wind-hurled sands. 

The same aspect of progressive ruin struck me in the 
grand Hall of Columns at Karnak. I learn that eleven 
columns of that vast eolonnade fell at once in 1899. To 
me it looked as if those gigantic blocks ought to stand 
forever. He must be more of a physicist than I am who 
can explain their fall. The grand hall met all my ex- 
pectations of its magnitude and solemn, wondrous 
grandeur ; yet when I had gone through the great 
temple of Earnak and seen how much of it lay pros- 
trate in inextricable confusion amid piles of debris, so 
that no skill of fitting can reconstruct wall, pylon, 
obelisk, and column, the feeling of ruin, ruin, over- 
powered my recollection of the real grandeur and 
beauty of what I had seen; greater than the brute 
magnitude of piled blocks in the pyramids, for here 
was a grander conception, more of intellect and taste; 
beauty as well as size. SAJltrix WnJLABD.

Headers of Mr. Pemberton's anecdotal biog- 
raphies of Edward A. Sothern, John Hare, and 
the Kendals, will not be disappointed in their 
expectation of entertainment when they open 
his latest work. His association with Bret 
Harte in play-writing, and the long and inti- 
mate friendship of the two, render him a fit 
person to pay this tribute to the deceased story- 
writer. For the part of Bret Harte's life that 
was spent in England perhaps no better choice 
of a biographer could have been made ; but 
the preceding forty years of American life are 
less fuliy and satisfactorily treated. To this 
portion of Harte's eventful career better justice 
could have been done by one of his old Cali- 
fornia friends, — Mr. Noah Brooks, for in- 
stance, or Mr. Joaquin Miller, or Mr. Charles 
Warren Stoddard. Indeed, the last-named 
writer has left on record some pleasing rem- 
iniscences of his departed friend, — to whom 
he avowed himself indebted for all that he had 
become and all that he had accomplished, — 
and from these reminiscences Mr. Pemberton 
quotes at some length. He gives these extracts 
as having been personally communicated to 
him for the purpose of his book ; but, except- 
ing a few lines, they are to be found, word for 
word, in Mr. Stoddard's recently-published 
" Exits and Entrances." We can readily be- 
lieve, however, that Mr. Pemberton had the 
first right to use this material, and that its 
publication by Mr. Stoddard was an after- 
thought. 

Like many another English writer before 
him, Mr. Pemberton betrays an imperfect 
knowledge of American history. He even goes 
out of his way to make a small contribution to 
the sum of human ignorance ; for after giving 
the place and date (Albany, 1839) of Bret 
Harte's birth, he is not content to let well 
enough alone, but adds that this city " was 
founded by the Dutch in 1623, and was thus 
the oldest European settlement in the United 
States, with the exception of Jamestown in 
Virginia," — both of which assertions are er- 
roneous. By the side of this may be put a 
careless blunder iu American geography. 
Speaking of Bret Harte's leaving California 
for the East in 1871, Mr. Pemberton says, 

•The Life of Brkt Habte. By T. Edgar Pemberton. 
IllDstrated. New York : Dodd, Mead <& Co. 



" The offers he now received to take his stand- 
ing in Western America became too tempting 
to be refused." 

A few little-known but significant facts and 
anecdotes about Bret Harte's life and writings 
are worthy of note here. The extent of his 
literary product has probably inclined most 
people to think of him as a rapid if not a care- 
less writer. He has often been accused of 
harping on the same string to the point of 
weariness, and of infusing no new life into his 
later works. A study of his biography shows 
him to have been as painstaking, as reluctant 
to go to press, and (if we are to credit Mr. 
Pemberton) as unhackneyed, at the end as in 
the beginning. He knew how to take infinite 
pains, and was his own severest critic. We 
are told that he never knew the humiliation of 
having a contribution rejected ; but the story 
that first made him known to the world had a 
narrow escape. " The Luck of Roaring Camp " 
came near being returned by himself as editor 
of the "Overland Monthly" to himself as a 
contributor to its columns. Publisher, printer, 
and proof-reader were united in their unfavor- 
able criticism of the morality and general tone 
of the sketch, the alarm first starting with the 
girl who read the proof and who was scandal- 
ized when she encountered a big, big D. But 
after consulting with friends, the author made 
the publication of the tale the condition of his 
retaining the editorship of the magazine. The 
rest is well known. Mr. Fields asked him 
for similar contributions for the " Atlantic," 
and the Eastern press was unanimous in his 
praise. 

Some of his most strikingly original and 
touching narratives, in both prose and verse, — 
little tales that brought tears to the reader's 
eyes, but were held to be impossible of actual oc- 
currence, — received subsequent confirmation 
of a remarkable sort. " In the Tunnel " de- 
scribes Tom Flynn's heroism in forcing his 
" pardner " to flee before him from a collaps- 
ing mine. 

" Run for your life, Jake I 
Run for your wife's sake ! 
Don't wait for me. " 

Years afterward the newspapers reported an 
almost identical instance of self-sacrifice in the 
case of two men engaged in cleaning the in- 
side of an eight-foot upright boiler. Suddenly 
a workman outside turned on the steam, know- 
ing that the cock was closed and assuming that 
it was tight. But it leaked badly, scalding steam 
poured in upon the two men, and they rushed

to the ladder to make their escape through the 
manhole at the top. The one who reached it 
first took one step, then stopped, drew back, 
and shouted, " You go first, Jim ; you are 
married ! " Like Flynn of Virginia, this humble 
hero paid for his generosity with his life. 

Bret Harte's love for his friends was beauti- 
ful, and it was heartily returned. For James 
Anthony Froude he cherished the warmest ad- 
miration and affection. Perhaps the fact that 
both were romancers, the one professedly, the 
other under the guise of historian, made them 
80 peculiarly congenial. As we have lately 
taken occasion to present the historian in not 
exactly the most flattering light, perhaps it will 
be well to try to balance the account by quot- 
ing Bret Harte's opinion of him. He writes 
to his wife : 

" But Froude — dear old noble fellow — is splendid. 
I love him more than I ever did in America. He is 
great, broad, manly — Democratic in the best sense of 
the word, scorning all sycophancy and meanness, ac- 
cepting all that is around him, yet more proud of his lit- 
erary profession than of his kinship with these people 
whom he quietly controls. There are only a few liter- 
ary men like him here, but they are kings. I could 
not have had a better introduction to them than through 
Froude, who knows them all, who is Tennyson's best 
friend, and who is anxious to make my entree among 
them a success." 

The biographer takes pains to assure the 
reader again and again that Bret Harte's genius 
was not so narrowly circumscribed as is com- 
monly believed, that he could and did write on 
other themes than those Californian. Yet the 
appended Bibliography, which fills nine page? 
and seems to have been carefully prepared, 
makes a very small showing of any other than 
California stories and poems. As the inimi- 
table painter of these far-western scenes he 
will always be remembered, and that is glory 
enough. 

Of the consulate at Glasgow, which was pre- 
ceded by a briefer one at Cref eld on the Rhine, 
we read much that is interesting. That the 
Glasgow consul's office was the one place where 
the erratic consul was sure not to be found, 
passed into a proverb. The attractions of Lon- 
don and Paris were too strong for him, al- 
though there is no reason to believe that the 
routine work of his office suffered by his ab- 
sence. With the outgoing of the Arthur ad- 
ministration the genial incumbent was set free 
from " the desk's dead wood," and thereafter 
he passed most of his time in London. His 
letters and not«s to English friends are always 
bright and amusing. To Colonel Arthur Col- 



lins, one of his theatre-loving friends, he dashes 
off the following : 

" Yes. Saturday ' suits ' and looks auspicious. I have 
had the cook examine the entrails of a fowl, and find 
the omens propitious! Let it be Saturday, then. Ton 
will give me ' bread and pulse ' at Brookes', and I will 
lead you to Arcadian stalls at the Alhambra or Empire. 
For heaven's sake let us go somewhere where we can 
laugh in the right place! I have not yet dared to face 
my Christmas shopping, but I'll pick up your offering 
at the Club and send you mine. It is so difficult to find 
something sufficiently idiotic and useless, to keep up our 
fond, foolish custom with." 

While Mr. Pemberton's work can claim to be 
neither a full account of Bret Harte's life nor 
a critical study of him as a writer, it is perhaps 
as satisfactory a memorial as could be expected 
so soon (less than a year) after the novelist's 
untimely death, and will be hailed with satis- 
faction wherever the " Heathen Chinee " has 
become a familiar character, and by all who 
enjoy the chatty and anecdotal in biography.

The Case of the 3f egro.» 
No thinking man any longer contemplates 
the possibility of an offhand settlement of the 
Negro problem. With a Negro population ap- 
proaching ten millions, and with the masses of 
both the white and the black race permeated 
by the prejudices growing out of slavery and 
the Civil War and enhanced by the blunders 
and crimes of the early years of emancipa- 
tion, the best that can reasonably be hoped for 
now is a slow and steady progress in the right 
direction, — that is, in the direction of the 
highest possible freedom of opportunity for 
both white and black, unhampered by unfair 
legislation or administration, or by the no less 
galling methods of social oppression in walks 
of life where the law does not and should not

In the countless attempts toward settlement, 
by far the most prominent at the present time

are scarcely more familiar than that of the 
Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute. The 
message which Mr. Washington feels it his 
duty to bear to his race is, '■'■Make yourselves in- 
dustrially necessary, each man and woman 
of you, to the community in which you live. 
Let the pursuit of art, literature, and politics 
wait, for the present, and train the mind di- 
rectly to the guidance of the skilled hand. 
When you shall have learned to raise two or 
three bushels of corn or potatoes, two or three 
bales of cotton, on the ground where but one 
grows to-day, when you begin to pay heavy 
freights into the coffers of the railroads which 
now force you into ' Jim Crow ' cars, when you 
figure as stockholders in the enterprises which 
now discriminate against you, then you will be 
rated simply as men and women, and neither 
hated nor pitied on the ground of color." 
Around this idea the work of the Tuskegee In- 
stitute has been built up, with careful attention 
to moral training, of course, hand in hand with 
the industrial. The idea has gained an im- 
mense popularity. It has seemed to justify it- 
self by its results, and Mr. Washington has be- 
come, as Professor Du Bois well says, a leader 
both of the black race and the white. 

No doubt the feature in Professor W. E. B. 
Du Bois's « The Souls of Black Folk " which 
will draw the most immediate attention is the 
fact that the writer takes determined and em- 
phatic issue with Mr. Booker Washington's 
policy, and that too in its most salient point, — 
the insistence upon the industrial, and the ele- 
mentary, in negro education. Professor Du 
Bois is perhaps the most scholarly man of his 
race in America today, — a man of high schol- 
arship and culture in that broader republic of 
human attainment which knows no limitation 
of race, color, or clime. In his acquaintance 
with the art and literature of various lands and 
ages he finds the best solace for the peculiar 
troubles entailed upon him and his by race 
prejudice in this land and age. " I sit with 
Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the 
color line I move arm in arm with Balzac 
and Dumas, where smiling men and welcom- 
ing women glide in gilded halls. From out the 
caves of evening that swing between the strong- 
limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I 
summon Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul 
I will, and they come all graciously, with no 
scorn nor condescension. So, wed with Truth, 
I dwell above the Veil." One can readily see 
that such a spirit would scent the danger of 
low, materialistic ideals in the Tuskegee pro- 



gramme, so rigidly industrial. And we are not 
sure that there is not reason for his fear. To 
rely too solely upon worldly thrift is the great 
temptation of the age. It may be true, as Mr. 
Washington says, that the Negro who will pay 
$10,000 a year in freights will not have to ride 
in a "Jim Crow" car; but there are a great 
many white people who would rather ride in a 
"Jim Crow" with a Burghardt Du Bois or 
a Booker T. Washington on the other end of 
the seat than in a Pullman with either Negroes 
or white men whose consideration at the hands 
of the railway officials should grow only out of 
the amount paid to the road in freights. It is 
certainly possible to go too far in adjuring the 
Negroes to put away their ambition to enter the 
higher fields of literature and learning, and to 
forego their legitimate desire to avail themselves 
at will of the rights and privileges conferred 
upon them by the Constitution. Suppose that 
our colored millions should become industrious 
and prosperous, and fairly up with the average 
in personal morals, too, but entirely apathetic 
as to political rights and duties, and devoid of 
ambition toward the highest mental and spirit- 
ual development, — the present Negro problem 
would then be practically solved, but would it 
be an acceptable solution to anyone with a con- 
sistent belief in freedom and equality as the 
best basis for progress and permanence in hu- 
man government and society ? 

Let no one assume, however, that Professor 
Du Bois and Principal Washington are hope- 
lessly at variance. The divergence, at most, 
bears only upon present methods. Their ulti- 
mate aim is one, — the uplifting of their people 
physically and materially, mentally, morally, 
and spiritually. All that the latter can do to 
improve the material condition of their common 
people the former will gladly welcome. " So 
far as Mr. Washington preaches Thrift, Pa- 
tience, and Industrial Training for the masses, 
we must hold up his hands and strive with him, 
rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the 
strength of this Joshua, called of God and of 
man to lead the headless host." And we are 
very seriously mistaken in Mr. Washington if 
he would knowingly put any obstacle in the 
path of any one of his race who has the am- 
bition to climb to a place on the higher seats 
of mental culture by the side of Professor Du 
Bois, at any rate when that ambition is coupled 
with evidence of sufficient mental ability to 
give a reasonable hope of results commensurate 
with the effort. Many of the white race are be- 
ginning to doubt whether we have not gone too

far in pressing into the higher studies a class 
of youths who might readily make skilful and 
useful followers of some industrial pursuit, 
but have not the mental makeup for successful 
assimilation of the higher learning. We have 
not the statistics at hand by which to test Pro- 
fessor Du Bois's claim that Mr. Washington's 
work is drying up the fountains of support for 
the higher education of colored youths in other 
than industrial lines, but we feel quite confi- 
dent that such a result would be contrary to 
his desire. We are not sure that Mr. Wash- 
ington realizes the possible value of this higher 
learning to the very industrial training in which 
he is so deeply interested, — in fact but very 
few, white or colored, have realized it. It is 
true, however, that agriculture and the me- 
chanical pursuits offer a fair field for the very 
highest type of trained intellect which the more 
distinctively cultural studies, Greek, logic, phil- 
osophy, etc., can produce. As the college grad- 
uate multiplies in the land, more and more will 
he be driven from sheer overcrowding else- 
where to devote his powers to these more fun- 
damental means of livelihood, and the Negro 
will need his own trained leaders here as else- 
where. On the other hand we are not sure 
that Professor Du Bois, on more careful con- 
aideration, would feel himself justified in add- 
ing to the passage quoted above, the words : 
*' But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for 
injustice. North or South, does not rightly value 
the privilege and duty of voting, belittles the 
emasculating effects of caste distinctions, and 
opposes the higher training and ambition of 
our brighter minds, — so far as he, the South, 
or the Nation, does this, — we must unceas- 
ingly and firmly oppose them." Frank and full 
confidence between these two leaders of their 
race will surely enable them each warmly to aid 
the other in his chosen field, to the great advan- 
tage of their common aim. 

We have placed among the material for this 
notice a work of a type far different from the 
writings of Professor Du Bois and Principal 
Washington, — "The Leopard's Spots," by 
Mr. Thomas Dixon, Jr. Though Mr. Dixon's 
book is thrown into the form of a novel, so far 
as it can be said to possess form at all, its aim 
is to justify to Northern readers the attitude 
of political and social suppression assumed to- 
ward the Negro by the dominant white senti- 
ment of the South. As to the writers method, 
he has chosen to set forth as vividly as possible 
the faults and crimes current among the Ne- 
groes of the South, culminating in an unflinch- 



ing relation of a fatal assault by a brutal Negro 
upon an innocent white girl, and an equally un- 
sparing description of the punishment swiftly 
visited upon the ravisher, — burning at the 
stake. Plainly the design is that the reader 
shall exclaim in bis indignation, ^' I too would 
have helped to do the same, under the same 
circumstances ! " And crude as the book is in 
most respects, it must be admitted that this 
portion of it is quite skilfully adapted to the 
end in view. And Mr. Dixon selected his time 
well, too, — the time when our unfortunate ex- 
periment in the Philippines has so generally 
deadened the public conscience toward any ap- 
peal to that finer regard for the rights of man 
simply as man, which was such an inspiration 
to the masses of the North in the initial years 
of our experiment with Negro freedom ; when 
the eloquent Curtis could sway audiences at his 
will with the thought that now at length oar 
government had been placed squarely upon its 
only consistent basis, the right of every citizen 
to a full participation in the government under 
which he is obliged to live. Mr. Washington 
thought that he saw great reason for hope in 
the fact that white and black fought bravely 
together in the battles of the Spanish- American 
war. Professor Du Bois shows far truer in- 
sight into the tendencies resulting from that 
conflict when he speaks of " the silently grow- 
ing assumption of this age that the probation 
of races is past, and that the backward races 
of today are of proven inefficiency and not 
worth the saving." But to go back to Mr. 
Dixon, it is only the unthinking man that can 
draw from his baleful picture the final conclu- 
sion which the writer desires. The Southern 
courts themselves, as Mr. Dixon would hardly 
have the hardihood to deny, can be depended 
upon absolutely to inflict the extreme penalty 
of the law upon any Negro identified as the 
perpetrator of such crime as he describes ; 
and the Southern legislatures can as surely be 
depended upon to strengthen its laws for the 
suppression of such crime if in any case they 
are not sufficiently strong already. Under such 
circumstances no moral man in his right mind 
should allow his prejudices to lead him into the 
support, directly or indirectly, of lynching. 
We commend to Mr. Dixon the Intelligent 
reasoning of Professor Du Bois and Mr. Wash- 
ington on this subject. He has much to learn 
from either one of them. He will find, for 
instance, that the faults of their race which he 
has passionately asserted are by them dispas- 
sionately admitted, — on the whole, a rather

more effective mode of presentation, if the end 
of presentation be the eradication of the faults 
in question. 

Of course everybody reads more or less of 
Mr. Booker Washington, either from his books 
or from the frequent addresses occasioned by 
the prominence of his educational veork. Pro- 
fessor Du Bois is known to a less extensive cir- 
cle. We believe that a wide reading of the 
latter's new book will do much to promote a 
correct understanding of the problems of 
Negro education and citizenship. In style, it 
must be pronounced somewhat uneven, — al- 
ways readily intelligible, rising now and then 
to a genuine eloquence, sometimes perhaps a 
little more flowery or figurative than the occa- 
sion demands, rather crude in certain instances 
in dealing with the great mysteries of human 
life ; but all in all quite above the style of many 
who would be slow to admit that anything good 
in a literary way could come out of the African 
Nazareth. As to the tone of the book, we be- 
lieve that the author would do well to imbibe 
a little more of the hopeful spirit of Principal 
Washington. He is distinctly right in the 
opinion that the cause of the Negro has for the 
present suffered a serious backset in many im- 
portant particulars ; but he does not accept the 
pessimistic conclusion that this lost ground is 
irrecoverable. This being so, perhaps he might 
find good working capital in a little more of 
the cheerful attitude. And yet one who stops 
to consider the essential bitterness of beating 
against closed doors which ought to be open 
will not condemn too severely the heart that 
cannot always show cheer under such circum- 
stances. And it may be, too, that the most of 
us need this demonstration that the Negro is 
actually capable of intense mental suffering 
under unjust treatment. The recognition of 
human brotherhood is not a strong point with 
us at present. 

Composed at different times and for different 
immediate purposes, the various chapters of Pro- 
fessor Du Bois's volume do not present a formal 
unity, and yet they all bear in one way or an- 
other upon the thought suggested by the col- 
lective title, " The Souls of Black Folk." On 
the historical side we find a very valuable sketch 
of the aims and failures, as well as the actual 
achievements, of the Freedmen's Bureau. Else- 
where the author's own experience as a country 
school teacher is related in an extremely inter- 
esting manner. Another chapter, essentially 
historical fact, to all appearances, though min- 
gled with a certain amount of entirely consis- 



tent fiction, tells of the tragic end of a Negro 
youth who went away to college and educated 
himself beyond the possibility of contentment 
with bis old environment (just as thousands of 
white boys are always doing, to the best inter- 
ests of themselves and all concerned), and 
failed, upon returning, to accommodate him- 
self adequately to the powers of prejudice 
around him. But it is not our intention to give 
a detailed exposition of the book's contents. 
Enough has been indicated to show that all 
who are, or ought to be, interested in the gen- 
eral subject should read it : to go further might 
tempt some such person into the belief that he 
had the drift of it sufficiently to excuse him 
from this duty. W. H. Johnson. 



A Great German Publisher.* 



The personality alone of the author and the 
subject of the volumes under review would 
arouse extended interest in their contents. 
Georg Joachim Goeschen I., the subject, was 
the foremost German publisher of the last quar- 
ter of the eighteenth century (the great period 
of German literature), the publisher of the 
complete works of Klopstock and Wieland, of 
the first edition of Goethe's collected works, 
and of most of Schiller's prose works as well 
as " Don Carlos." George Joachim III., Vis- 
count Goschen, the author, was the foremost 
financier of England during the last quarter 
of the nineteenth century, author of " The 
Theory of Foreign Exchange," a member of 
Gladstone's first cabinet, Chancellor of the Ex- 
chequer in Salisbury's cabinet, and the mana- 
ger of the most important government financial 
operation of the century, — the conversion of 
the public debt. Viscount Goschen lives hale 
and hearty, devoting his well-earned leisure to 
authorship. 

From Goeschen to Goschen, from German 
publisher to British Chancellor in two genera- 
tions, is a transformation that might of itself 
fascinate the student of history and ethnology. 
The facts, supported by the portraits which in- 
troduce the present volumes, show how near 
akin after all are continental Saxon and insu- 
lar Saxon, how few the touches needed to trans-

form the amiable, smooth-faced, frill-bosomed 
German of Volume I. into the grave and kindly 
mutton-chopped British gentleman who intrep- 
idly faces the task of Volume II., — the task of 
writing, we would say, not that of reading, for 
this latter is far from a task. 

Still another interesting personal feature of 
the biography is the revelation of the character 
of the author, afforded by his attitude toward 
his subject. It is a delicate task to write the 
life of one's grandfather. It is so difficult to 
avoid the standpoint of family pride, to keep 
the biography from becoming a mere " trib- 
ute." And if one succeeds in this, he incurs 
the risk of seeming heartless and of being ac- 
cused of want of filial respect. Here Viscount 
Gosehen's naturally judicial temperament has 
been happily supported by favoring circum- 
stances. Not only the two generations of life, 
but also the space of the North Sea and the 
transferred national allegiance, have served to 
give the distance necessary for objectivity. 

" I may frankly say that I scarcely knew him till I be- 
gan my preparations for this book. I have made the 
publisher's intimate acquaintance as I progressed with 
my task, reading countless letters to him and from him, 
and learning how be was judged by his contemporaries, 
but in large measure allowing him to gain my affection 
by what he wrote, did and suffered himself. It will be 
my fault and not his, if he fails to win my reader's re- 
gard." 

Thus a son, who from wont and usage has 
perhaps taken his father as so much a matter 
of course as to have no warm feelings toward 
him, comes in later life, sometimes, to appre- 
ciate and love him almost as though he had 
never been related to him. 

It is the life of Goeschen the publisher that 
we have. The reader is not unpleasantly 
aware of the fact that it is the life of the grand- 
father of Viscount Goschen. The author's pur- 
pose to adopt " a contemporary attitude toward 
the men with whom my grandfather was asso- 
ciated " was supported by the possession of 
the old publisher's books and correspondence, 
although a considerable number of letters from 
the most important period of his life were lost 
or stolen in the transfer of his business to the 
Cotta firm. It is to be desired that the Goeschen 
correspondence might be printed entire, or at 
least so far as the correspondents were figures 
in German history and literature. 

The essential value of this Goeschen biog- 
raphy is to be found in the picture of the busi- 
ness and family life of Goeschen, a typical, or 
rather, perhaps, an ideal-typical German citi- 
zen of the period from 1775 to 1828 : in the in- 



sight given into the conditions of the book- 
trade for this period ; in the side-lights upon 
the character of the heroes of German litera- 
ture ; and, finally, in its contribution to the pic- 
ture of Germany during the Napoleonic wars. 

Left homeless at the age of thirteen, by en- 
ergy and integrity and devotion to a purpose 
Goeschen became at thirty-four the publisher 
of Schiller's " Don Carlos " and Goethe's col- 
lected works, and at forty probably the most 
sought and most successful publisher in Ger- 
many. His young manhood vras passed in that 
literary dawn in Germany when it was " bliss 
to be alive, and to be young was very Heaven." 
He was intimate with Schiller, Koemer, and 
Wieland, and with many lesser lights. While 
he developed a fairly shrewd and practical 
head, he was soulful all his life. His soul was 
filled with sentiment, and not merely with sen- 
timentality. His heart was in his profession. 
He wanted to make the best book possible in 
Germany. He was proud of the high literary 
connections of his press, and jealous of this 
pride no less than of his business honor. Sen- 
sitiveness and pride, with some quick temper 
and stubbornness, sometimes disturbed his 
friendly relations with great writers, while they 
thwarted some of his most cherished businesa 
plans. He was a good citizen in the best sense 
of the term, a kind neighbor, a responsible em- 
ployer, a real patriot. In religion and poli- 
tics he was a man of the middle path ; not be- 
cause he compromised with his conscience, but 
because he was well balanced. 

"Truth, justice, bencTolence. Such was the ideal 
of life, such the view of Christian teaching, which the 
publisher, whose years had been spent amidst violent 
revolutions of belief and in the storm-swept days of 
the Atifklaentng, retained up to the last, and preached 
to his fellow-men. The dignity of Christianity came 
home to him with special force, and he believed in ' the 
dignity, the holiness, the ennobling influence, the price- 
less blessing, of true prayer.' " 

The Aufklaerung was no spectre to Goeschen. 
He interpreted it as 

" The voice of the founder of our religion, the voice 
of all nature, the voice of our own hearts, — voices 
which no one can understand who is not aufgeklaert 
[illumined]. And what do these voices tell us ? They 
call to us, < Trust to the guidance of the Heavenly 
Father; all the rest is gubtilty and fraud.' " 

Thus it will be seen that Goeschen was some- 
thing of a preacher. Not only in such publica- 
tions as Zacharias Becker's " Help-in-Need " 
and the various "Frauen-Journale," but in 
his own " Johanns Reise " (for Goeschen took 
to authorship in a modest way), and in the 
Grimma Wochenblatt, did Goeschen labor 



S04

steadily for the improvement of the manners 
and morals of his countrymen. 

" And will the question be asked, ' Did Goeschen 
'Strive in his own life to act up to the creed he pieached 
— the creed in which benevolence, the same courtesy 
toward the poor as to the rich, the constant remem- 
brance of the oneness of human nature, were so con- 
spicuous ? ' The record of his dealings with his 
neighbors, his life as a citizen, an employer, and a 
friend of the poor, prove that he cau stand the test." 

" On the whole, he was a man belonging to the type 
of an earlier and almost expiring generation of German 
publishers, full of a firm honorableness, holding fast to 
good old traditions, in contrast to a rising generation, 
who were anxious to impart an entirely new form and 
spirit to the book-trade." 

When Goeschen came upon the business 
stage the contest over the " division of the 
spoils " between authors and publishers had 
but just begun. Klopstock had put forth his 
" Deutsche Gelehrtenrepublik," one feature of 
■which was to be cooperative publishing. The 
idealistic Germans were quick to put the plan 
into operation in the twin institutions, Die 
Buchhandlung der Gelehrten and Die Ver- 
lagscasse. The first was to manage the issue 
of books, the second to finance the individual 
authors. In the second of these institutions 
<jroeschen was employed, after a long appren- 
ticeship to the publishing business in the 
Leipzig house of Crusius. It is needless to say 
that the " Authors' Publishing Company " did 
not last long. But Goeschen acquired through 
this connection an invaluable acquaintance 
among the ambitious young writers of Ger- 
many. 

However, the vital contest was not between 
authors and publishers, but between the legit- 
imate publishers and their clients, on the 
one hand, and the " pirate publishers," on the 
other. The rights of the author in his output 
were taken very lightly everywhere, which, 
with the minutely sub-divided condition of 
Germany politically, made life indeed a strug- 
gle for existence, with very few chances in 
favor of even the fittest author. When a book 
was about to be born, its god-father, the pub- 
lisher, was obliged to write or travel from 
court to court and beg the protection of this 
Grace or that Serene Highness for this or that 
particular territory, with no prospect in the 
world of securing a copyright good for all Ger- 
many. In addition to the uncertainty of ob- 
taining a copyright was the probability that the 
censor would prune the book or exclude it en- 
tirely. 

The letters and memoirs of Cotta and 
Perthes and Goeschen are full of their variou 



campaigns and devices against piracy. But 
Goeschen seems in his day to have been the 
most devoted and vehement warrior in the 
cause. His advertisements and denunciations 
and manifestoes are as entertaining as they 
are numerous. Self-piracy, as it may be called, 
was a curious practice which was sometimes 
resorted to by Goeschen as well as by others. 
Along with the various editions on fine paper 
and with royal margins bearing the imprint of 
the publisher, he would issue an edition from 
the same types but on the cheapest paper and 
without imprint. This he would put upon the 
market through a dealer at some other point, 
and, having the precedence in time, would hope 
thus to forestall a really pirated edition. This 
proceeding did not always meet the approval 
of the author, though it was clearly in his in- 
terest, and it has also added to the difficulties 
of the bibliographer. Among the subscribers to 
the complete edition of Goethe's works, in the 
list prefixed to the fourth volume, appeared the 
following : 

" A Pirate Publisher in — 
" This person, who is outside the pale, and whom the 
following Dedication [i. e.: Goethe's introductory poem] 
does not concern, is warned by the publisher that he has 
taken carefully considered measures against him." 

Goethe, who had severe ideals of the dignity 
of authorship, requested that this " drive " be 
omitted from future editions. Again Goeschen 
would call direct attention to the offender, as 
in the following, from the " Litter atur-Zeitung ": 

"Notice. — C. G. Schmieder in Karlsruhe has com- 
mitted the unparalleled villainy of pirating six of my 
new publications all at once. I hereby publicly accuse 
this man of an unheard-of robbery, and warn every one 
who has the misfortune to have dealings with this fel- 
low, to beware of the rascal." 

Other and more effective methods of getting 
ahead of the pirates were serial publication 
and the issue of frequent revisions which sought 
to displace previous ones. Novels, dramas, and 
histories issued serially aroused the public ap- 
petite so that it hungered for the earliest pos- 
sible continuations of the subjects, and these 
could be had only from the legitimate pub- 
lisher. This accounts for the large number of 
journalistic ventures in the classical period of 
German literature. They were prompted more 
by the interests of the publisher than by the 
demands of the public. The " Thalia," the 
" Deutscher Mercur," the " Litteratur- und 
Voelkerkunde," the " Frauen-Journal," the 
" Deutsches Museum," were some of the jour- 
nals published by Goeschen. 

Goeschen was not only a patron of literature

«id a friend of authors, but he was an enthu- 
siastic and artistic printer. It was bis constant 
ambition to equal in Germany the work of 
Bodoni in Italy and Didot in France. When he 
had succeeded in having fine and attractive type 
desianed and cast for his own work he felt that 
be bad really accomplished something. He 
took more pride in his editions of Griesbach's 
New Testament and Wolf's Homer than in any 
other achievement of his life. Bat in every 
undertaking he had a genuine concern for his 
reputation as a printer, as well as for that of Ger- 
many. It is interesting to note that Goeschen 
rejected the plans and proposals of Koenig, 
the inventor of the power press ; but in this 
he was no more conservative and incredulous 
than many other publishers. 

Goeschen's biography casts no entirely new 
lights upon the great authors with whom he 
^ealt. We are indeed brought more " humanly 
near " to them, but Wieland remains the kind 
and conscientious and fussy favorite of the 
masses : Goethe's self-sufficient care for " Num- 
ber One " is intensified a shade : and Schiller 
is still the fiery friend, the impulsive idealist, 
the right-meaning democrat. With all three 
of his great clients Goeschen's relations were 
sometimes strained, and it is here that Viscount 
Goschen manifests his most charming dis- 
crimination. More than once he admits that 
his grandfather was hasty and indiscreet. Yet 
if he jwints out Goethe's ungenerous and sus- 
picious habit of demanding the last penny in 
advance before delivering his manuscripts, it 
is not for the purpose of belittling the poet, 
though he may love the man less. Despite the 
fact that Schiller grieved the generous friend 
■of his obscure and struggling youth by seeking 
another publisher in Cotta, the grandson is no 
less devoted to the " Singer of Liberty," and 
points out how Goeschen was at fault in the 
misunderstanding. 

Among the interesting facts here given are 
the figures of the slow sale of Goethe's col- 
lected works, the edition of 1786-90, in which 
appeared " Tasso " and " Faust " for the first 
time. The subscription to the set went limp- 
ing, and the sales of the individual volumes were 
counted by hundreds only. It was many years 
before the first edition of 3000 copies was 
sold out. On the other hand, authors appear as 
receiving large honorariums whose very names 
are scarcely known today, such as Muell- 
ner and Houwald. Goeschen paid the latter 
for '• The Pirates " 2000 Thaler, a sum equal 
to what he had paid Goethe for the eight vol- 



umes of the collected works, including the first 
appearance of *' Iphigenie " in verse, "Tasso," 
and ••Faust"! Then as now. great obscurities 
often eclipsed the great luminaries. 

The last third of Volume II., occupied with 
the years from 1806 until Goeschen's death, 
adds its contribution to the picture of decline 
and distress under the invasions of Napoleon : 
the execution of the book-seller Palm, the per- 
secution of Zacharias Becker, the treacherous 
assault upon Luetzow's Corps (in which were 
Georg Joachim Goeschen II. and young Theo- 
dor Koerner), the humiliation of the Saxon 
princes, and the horrors of the battles in and 
about Leipzig. Throughout all Goeschen kept 
his integrity. 

" Both as a publisher and a man he could look back 
on an honorable and useful life. No corrupting books 
had issued from his presses, no struggling author had 
CTer been exploited by him. No activities had more 
stroDglr appealed to him than such as were directed to 
the improvement of the masses or to the higher cul- 
ture of women. Never had he forgotten the eloquent 
appeal of the youthful Schiller to his Gohlis friends, 
that ' all of them should so bear themselves, each in 
his own vocation, that the world should miss them 
when they died.' " 

It is probable that the tjrpography and the 
rich illustrations of these volumes would have 
given pleasure to George Joachim Goeschen. 
Whether he would have approved the sacrifice 
of the "o-umlaut" in his name to the inability 
of the English to pronounce it, may fairly be 
questioned. Viscount Goschen might properly 
do as he pleased with his own name, but it 
seems odd to find side by side the German 
contemporaries Goethe and Goschen. Of typo- 
graphical errors we find less than half a dozen. 
The correction of Lewes, Vol. I., p. 261, re- 
garding the first publication of Faust I., is due 
to a misunderstanding ; Lewes is speaking of 
the complete Part I. of Faust. Of course he 
knew of the Fragment of 1790. 

On the whole Goschen 's biography of Goe- 
schen is an important contribution to the his- 
tory of German literature, as well as to the 
history of general culture and of the book- 
trade. W. H. Cakbuth. 



Ix the preparation of the " Centenary " edition of 
Emerson's works, soon to be issued by Messrs. Hough-

absolute accuracy of text. It will be that of the " River- 
side " edition, which presents, in the case of the prose 
works published during Emerson's lifetime, the read- 
ings finally decided upon by Emerson himself. The 
prose volumes issued after the author's death were col- 
lected and revised by the late Mr. J. Elliot Cabot, Em- 
erson's biographer and life-long friend.

Thj£ Cambridge Moderx History.* 



That general histories have not often found 
favor with the historian is an undeniable, 
though probably not a surprising, fact. The 
very comprehensiveness of an undertaking 
which attempts to cover successive periods in 
a score or more of nationalities would seem to 
prohibit that exactness which proclaims scien- 
tific history. And yet the idea of producing a 
successful general history has always had an 
attraction for historians, partly no doubt be- 
cause of the obstacles to be overcome, but more 
largely because of the recognition that general 
histories may provide a necessary fund of gen- 
eral information for men who cannot hope to 
know all things on all subjects and periods. 
One such historian was the late Lord Acton, 
and the result of his faith in this phase of his- 
torical achievement is the production of the first 
volume of the " Cambridge Modern History." 

According to the editorial preface to this 
volume, the plan of the work, its division into 
volumes and chapters, and the selection of con- 
tributors for specific parts, were all conceived 
and mapped out by Lord Acton, and his gen- 
eral plan has been followed practically, in pre- 
paring the material of the twelve volumes that 
are to constitute the work. The conception of 
a carefully compiled general history, to be un- 
dertaken by men trained in scholarly selection 
and condensation from the writings of special- 
ists, is not new. Such work has already been 
performed creditably in both Germany and 
France. But Lord Acton's scheme differed 
from this in that he proposed to have the va- 
rious topics in each chapter of each volume 
written by the specialist himself, to require of 
the specialist a clear presentation of the most 
recent investigation and knowledge in his 
particular field, and to assign to editorial su- 
pervision the duty of such combination and 
arrangement as would result in a history con- 
sisting not in " a mere string of episodes, but 
displaying a continuous development." This 
plan the editors have sought to execute. Any 
judgment upon the skill with which they have 
accomplished their task must be based upon 
three primary grounds, namely, the ability 
shown in combining the general topics or pe- 
riods treated in the different volumes, the im- 
portance given to the more limited phases of 

•The Cambridge Moderi; Histobt. Planned by the 
late Lord Acton, LL.D.; edited by A. W. Ward, Litt.D., 
Q. W. Prothero, Litt.D., and Stanley Leathes, M.A.

each volume topic, and the essential merit of 
separate articles from the point of view of spe- 
cialized knowledge. Naturally the first of these 
must wait for the appearance of several volumes 
at least, while the third requires an expert 
familiarity with many subjects, which no one 
person is likely to claim. In the second par- 
ticular only, is any fair judgment possible 
upon the merit of the work. Meanwhile it is 
to be noted that the use of this plan in a gen- 
eral history is not only distinctly novel, but is 
also both attractive and inspiring, and, if suc- 
cessfully executed, will result in establish- 
ing a higher standard for general historical 
writing. 

Examined for an estimate of successful com- 
bination and due proportion, the only fair basis 
at present, the first volume largely realizes 
Lord Acton's hopes. This volume has been 
made to perform a double duty in that while it 
covers the period, or rather the subject, of the 
Renaissance movements, noting their incep- 
tion, characteristics, and influence, it also lays 
that foundation in purely institutional history 
necessary to the proper understanding of later- 
volumes. In selecting from among the numer- 
ous manifestations of activity pertaining to the 
Renaissance, politics, economics, and social 
life as of primary interest in a historical sur- 
vey, it has been necessary to leave somewhat 
in the background the development and in- 
fluence of art, of science, and of kindred topics.. 
A like discrimination exists in the space de- 
voted to the various states of Europe. Italy 
is given five chapters, where Germany, Hun- 
gary, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and En- 
gland have but one chapter each. In both 
these instances the choice of topics is wholly 
logical and in accord with the general principle 
of proportional importance adopted by the 
editors. In some cases a balance of forces is 
brought out by editorial divisions, as in the 
assignment of Chapter V. to " Florence : Sa- 
vonarola " by Mr. E. Armstrong ; while Chap- 
ter VI. is entitled "Florence: Machiavelli," by 
Mr. L. Arthur Burd. Thus spiritual and po- 
litical characteristics are emphasized and con- 
trasted in arrangement as well as in context. 
The two contributions just mentioned are 
among the most attractive in the volume. 
Other notable chapters are "The Netherlands" 
by Mr. A. W. Ward, " Economic Change " by 
Mr. William Cunningham, " Catholic Europe "^ 
by Dr. William Barry, a conservative critical 
narrative written from the Catholic point of 
view, and " The Eve of the Reformation " by

Mr. Henry Charles Lea, the latter writer being 
the only American among the seventeen con- 
tributors to this first volume. It is, however, 
unfair to select chapters as noteworthy where 
all contributors have so evidently sought to 
fulfill first of all the one great purpose of the 
original plan, — to present a consecutive his- 
tory, embodying specialist knowledge, but for- 
saking the specialist's methods. Every man 
has honestly sought the point of contact, the 
junction point, with his neighbors, and in doing 
so has unquestionably sacrificed at times his 
own favorite field and methods. Evidence that 
the contributors have felt a genuine interest in 
the undertaking, as well as in the particular 
monograph to be presented, is one of the most 
striking characteristics of the volume. 

The form of presentation does not differ 
greatly from that customarily followed in mod- 
ern historical works. There is no index, this 
being reserved until the publication of the 
last volume, but its place is well supplied for 
the time being by comprehensive tables of con- 
tents for each chapter. At the end of the 
volume there is given for each general field or 
topic discussed, a bibliography, which, while not 
purporting to be complete in any sense, can 
not fail to prove of great practical use to the 
teacher of history who wishes to purchase the 
available books on some special subject, or to 
the student who desires to know where mate- 
rial is to be found. Thus the bibliography 
given for Mr. Ward's chapter on " The Nether- 
lands " first presents lists of special bibliog- 
raphies and of completed inventories of origi- 
nal documents with their location. Then 
follow about three hundred titles classified 
thus : (1) Collections, (2) Chronicles treating 
of the General History of the Netherlands, 
^3) Provincial and Local Chronicles, (4)Gen- 
eral History, Geography, and Institutions, (5) 
Histories of Successive Periods, (6) Histories 
of the Several Provinces, (7) Trade and In- 
dustry, (8) Religion, (9) Manners, Letters, 
and Art : and this is still further supplemented 
by cross references to the bibliographies of 
other chapters. For teachers and students 
who have not a sufficiently specialized knowl- 
edge to discriminate in the choice of books 
from larger bibliographies, these lists will be 
of much real assistance. 

No attempt has been made to judge the merits 
of the present volume on other ground than 
that of usefulness and that of realizing the 
primary idea of Lord Acton and the editors. 
There is one characteristic however, common 



to all the contributors to this volume, that dis- 
tinctly deserves notice. It is the attempt to 
present to the reader, movements and events 
from the contemporary point of view, and to 
give just such proportion of emphasis and im- 
portance to events as these events held for 
the men who witnessed them. The ability to 
do this is in itself so peculiarly the property 
of the thorough student, and is so elusive and 
uncontrollable when assumed by one who does 
not know absolutely, that its existence in this 
volume is sufficient evidence of scientific his- 
torical work. A true appreciation of the con- 
temporary historical importance of men and 
events is the first requisite of the scholar, and 
the ability to interpret this clearly for the 
benefit of others is one of the first tests of his- 
torical writing. In this respect at least, then, 
the " Cambridge Modern History," as illus- 
trated in its first volume, is unquestionably 
more than a compilation or a work of general 
reference, and is in fact, as Lord Acton hoped 
it would prove to be, a contribution to histori- 
cal knowledge possessing real historical merit.

Problkms of Industry axd Societt.* 

The group of books before as, on various phases 
of the modem problems of indostry and society, 
may, from their form and matter, be divided into 
two classes, — those which may be called books of 
record, and those which are made up of addresses 
and essays. Those in the former category eonsiat 
of a volume entitled " Labor and Capital," being 
a discussion of the relations of employer and em- 
ployed, and a volume entitled " Industrial Con- 
ciliation." The other three books, comprising the 
•' essay and address " g^oup, are Mr. Carroll D. 
Wright's " Some Ethical Phases of the Labor 
Question," Bishop Potter's "The Citizen in his 
Relations to the Industrial Situation," and Bishop 
Spalding's ''Socialism and Labor, and Other Argu- 
ments." 

Early in August of 1901, Bishop Potter wrote 
to Mr. W. R. Hearst, suggesting a " sympoeium of

clever men discussing the question of wages, com- 
mon ownership of plants, land, — anything to make 
the people think." The symposium began August 
25, and continued into November, — covering, in 
the words of the editor of the volume in which its 
proceedings are now reprinted, the Rev. John P. 
Peters, more than fifty large newspaper pages. The 
topics discussed are such as Combinations of Em- 
ployers and Employed, Trusts and the Labor- 
unions from a legal aspect, Conciliation and Ar- 
bitration, Model Industries, Socialism and the 
Single Tax, and^ the Unemployed ; and to their dis- 
cussion Mr. Hearst brought the pens of such men 
as Prof. J. B. Clark, Mr. Jacob Riis, Mr. Samuel M. 
Jones, the Rev. Josiah Strong, Mr. James B. Dill, 
Mr. H. D. Lloyd, Mr. John Mitchell, Bishop Potter, 
Cardinal Gibbons, President Hadley, and many 
others. The symposium emphasized what was al- 
ready pretty well known, namely, " that the oppo- 
sition is not to trusts as large corporations, but 
rather to monopolies ; that trade-unions are and 
have been, highly beneficial, although overstepping 
at times the bounds of the law ; that arbitration is 
a wise method of settling disputes, but that we are 
not ready for compulsory settlement of labor diffi- 
culties ; and, finally, that the single tax is not a 
panacea, but a promised step to better things. The 
book is a book of opinions, and useful in show- 
ing what certain men think, rather than in indi- 
cating the actual problem or the conditions of its 
solution. 

Closely allied to this volume is the one on " In- 
dustrial Conciliation," containing the proceedings 
of the Chicago and New York meetings of the 
National Civic Federation, an organization too well 
known, with its long list of influential members, to 
need any description here. This book has the ad- 
vantage of having its pages filled with the first-hand 
statements of men who employ and are employed- 
Although much that was said at the New York meet- 
ing was general, and oftentimes trivial, yet the 
reader is impressed with the good-feeling and frank- 
ness of speech that prevailed. In strength of view 
and clearness of statement, the papers of the Chicago 
meeting are decidedly above those which, according 
to the table of contents, were given at the New York 
meeting. There seems to have been at the latter 
no particular plan in the relation of the addresses 
to each other, each speaker being allowed to talk on 
the general topic, or on what was suggested by the 
previous speaker. In the Chicago meeting, however, 
definite topics were discussed, and on the whole 
with better results for the reader. The outcome of 
the meetings, in the organization of an Industrial 
Committee and its practical work, have somewhat 
overshadowed the importance of the papers read at 
the Chicago meeting. 

In Colonel Wright's volume on " Ethical Phases 
of the Labor Question " we have a collection of 
addresses and previously published articles dealing 
with a few present-day questions, such as " Religion 



in Relation to Sociology," and "The Relation of 
Political Economy to the Labor Question." There 
is also an essay on the Factory system, which ap- 
peared in part in the articles on " Factory System " 
in Johnson's Cyclopsedia and the Tenth Census of 
the United States ; and with it a paper on prison- 
labor, which appeared in part in an official report 
upon the same subject. The author's note presents 
the point of view that actuated the publishing of 
the book. He says : " The four essays forming the 
contents of this little volume have no particular 
correlation, except in the fact that the subjects 
treated are brought under the principle of ethics. 
There is no pretension of discussing broadly the 
labor question or general economic principles. While 
each essay is separate in its treatment, nevertheless 
the collection constitutes a concrete illustration of 
the application of moral elements to some of the 
important sociological questions of the day." 

" The Citizen in his Relations to the Industrial 
Situation," by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Potter, is a book 
made up of matter originally delivered as lectures 
at Yale University on the William E. Dodge foun- 
dation. The author seems to have missed the newer 
phases of the subject, and particularly in the chap- 
ter on " The Industrial Situation," to have taken a 
few scattered results as the actual problem. The 
book is marred by constant side-plays diverting 
from the main theme of the chapter, or by long and 
laborious approaches to the principal point, weak- 
ening the effect, particularly in the chapter on 
Corporations. It is rather curious to note that the 
post-office, which the author uses as an argument 
against socialism, is regarded by eminent authority 
as strongly favoring the extension of government 
functions. In fact, the argument of the book 
against that creed may be termed "stock argument." 
The last chapter is by all odds the best, and the 
strong words on individualism are well deserving 
of wide circulation. 

In the last book of the group we have the essays 
and addresses of an eminent prelate of the Catholic 
Church. It is the book of a sober-minded, thought- 
ful man, who is opposed to socialism, yet is hard 
pushed by the evils of the time. He sees dangers 
not so much in the economic or political difficulties 
as in the departure of the people from religion and 
in the pitfalls of a moral decline. To him, a state- 
controlled education is likely to weaken " one of the 
most essential and vital social forces, the sense of 
responsibility in parents," — a statement which may 
be regarded as at least a partial non sequitur. Our 
essayist has however, confused socialism with social- 
ism of the State. In a Marxian system of socialism, 
the government and state as we know them, are not 
to exist. Ricardo is made to bear the burden of 
originating the doctrine, — a popular error which 
the reading of the introduction to Gonner's edition 
of Ricardo's works would largely dispel. The style 
of the essays is delightful and at times brilliant.

A shea/ of 
poetic dramas. 



Four volames of dramatic verse 
upon Biblical subjects have recently 
come to our table. The Knicker- 
bocker Press (New York) publishes " David and 
Bathshua," a drama in five acts by Mr. Charles 
Whitworth Wynne. The relation has been found 
attractive to dramatists from Peele to Mr. Phillips, 
and the heroine is our old friend, the wife of Uriah, 
although the spelling of the name is a novelty. 
Mr. Wynne's blank verse is not distinguished. Mr. 
Thomas Ewing, Jr., is the author of a tragedy 
entitled " Jonathan," and published by the Funk & 
Wagnalls Co. This is the familiar story from the 
Book of Samuel I., and is elaborated in five acts of 
mingled verse and prose. The author, we are 
informed, is a patent lawyer. He writes rather 
better verse than Mr. Wynne, but it is not far 
removed from prose. Mr. Laurence Housman's 
" Bethlehem," published by the Macmillan Co., 
comes nearer to being literature. It is a nativity 
play, and naivete is its note. There are two acts, 
and many lyrical passages lend variety to the verse. 
The play has been performed, and we should think 
it might prove effective in a simple way. Mr. 
Henry Copley Greene's volume, published by the 
Scott-Thaw Co., gives us not one play but three. 
Their titles are " Pontius Pilate," " Saint Ronan of 
Brittany," and " Th^ophile." The first is a mystery 
in three acts ; the other two are miracle plays of a 
single act each. Mr. Greene does little more than 
play with mediaevalism, but he gives us many 
touches of true poetry. Plays in verse have been 
multiplying of late, for besides the four just 
mentioned we have several others. Mr. Percy 
Mackaye's comedy of *' The Canterbury Pilgrims," 
published by the Macmillan Co., gives us as char- 
acters the whole twenty-nine of the Tabard Inn, 
besides a dozen or more others, including the King, 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, John of Gaunt, and 
Wycliffe. There are four acts, and the play is in- 
tended for stage representation. Sentimental rela- 
tions between the Poet and the Prioress form the 
basis of the argument, but there is much variety of 
scene, and the author shows himself a loving stu- 
dent of Chaucer. The work has a most engaging 
mien, and we are much taken with the best parts 
of the author's verse. Professor Barrett Wendell 
gives us a volume of serious poetic art in the form 
of three plays published by the Messrs. Scribner. 
"Ralegh in Guiana" is a two-part drama in the 
Elizabethan manner, which presents in fine blank 
verse an episode in the later career of the explorer, 
besides embodying after a fashion the author's phi- 
losophy of history as far as it is concerned with the 
subject in hand. " Rosamond " is a single scene 
versifying Percy's ballad. " A Christmas Masque," 
for which Mr. Winthrop Ames provided the plot, 
is a club pageant based upon the period of the 
crusades. These experiments in the Elizabethan 



manner are more than interesting ; they are digni- 
fied productions that have a high degree of literary 
value. Mr. Maurice Baring's " The Black Prince" 
published by Mr. John Lane, is a four-act play in 
verse that is respectable and at times impassioned. 
Mistress Alice Ferrers acts a conspicuous and sin- 
gular part. A few short poems are gathered into 
the volume which contains this play. Mrs. Margaret 
L. Woods has found in the early history and rela- 
tions of G«orge I. of England an excellent subject 
for her five-act drama " The Princess of Hanover, "^ 
issued by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. There is much 
prose mingled with the blank verse, besides some 
exceptionally beautiful lyrics, and the whole is done 
in a fair imitation of the Elizabethan manner. 
The last play on our list is '■ Maximilian," by Mr. 
Edgar Lee Masters, published by Mr. Richard 6. 
Badger. It is a well-planned production, and the 
five acts of verse contain many passages that ar- 
rest the attention, but the subject — which is that of 
the ill-starred Mexican Empire — is too modern to 
lend itself to a thoroughly poetic treatment. 



Mr. F. B. Sanborn has chosen this 
Bmtrton dewed Spring as an opportune time for giv- 

ai close range, , * ^ ',*, . = 

mg to the public the second vol- 
ume in his series of reminiscences of the Concord 
philosophers, — " The Personality of Emerson. "^ 
Similar in intention to "The Personality of 
Thorean," it is published by Mr. Charles E. Good- 
speed in a handsomely-printed limited edition, 
uniform with the earlier volume. The portrait is 
etched from that painted by David Scott at Edin- 
burgh in 1848, and there are two facsimile letters. 
The book is a brief and somewhat desultory record 
of conversations, anecdotes, and impressions gath- 
ered during Mr. Sanborn's long acquaintance with 
Emerson, which dates back to 1852. One pecu- 
liarity of the memoir is that, in spite of its intimacy, 
it gives no hint of faults or failings in its subject. 
Henry James, Senior, and Alcott, called Emerson 
" the nnfallen man," and Mr. Sanborn accepts 
the judgment Other friends, to be sure, Ellery 
Channing among them, complained of finding him 
capriciously cold and distant at times ; but this, Mr. 
Sanborn thinks, was " a part of his fate rather than 
an element in his disposition." It was quite insep- 
arable from his deeply poetic, spiritual way of life, 
and was more than offset by his wide sympathy for 
struggling causes and unfortunate individuals and 
his gentle tolerance for the eccentricities of genius 
exhibited by some of his transcendentalist friends. 
Mr. Sanborn began to read Emerson before he was 
sixteen. While still an undergraduate at Harvard 
College he knew the great man intimately, and his 
account of the little group of Emersonians at Har- 
vard and of Emerson's kindly response to their 
youthful enthusiasm is most interesting. Towards 
the end of his senior year Mr. Sanborn received 
an offer from Emerson to become the teacher of a 
small school in Concord. He boarded with Ellery

Ohanning, met Thoreau, walked, and swam or 
skated on Walden, with Alcott and Emerson, took 
part in the famous "conversations," — in short, he 
had an unrivaled opportunity to see Concord, "land 
of Hyperbole and Humor," as he calls it, at close 
range. Then and later — for he continued to live 
in Concord — he saw Emerson in companionship 
with his great contemporaries, and he reproduces, 
as they fell from Emerson's lips, his estimates of 
each. He tells of Emerson's habits of thought and 
of life, and repeats his table-talk and forgotten bits 
of his lectures. He does all this very informally, 
with little effort to systematize his material or to 
summarize his conclusions, and with no attempt at 
all to startle with novel views or epigramatic state- 
ments. As he says in his final paragraph, he has 
simply written down a little first-hand information 
about Emerson, leaving the facts " to bear their own 
testimony to his character," and hoping, since no 
wholly adequate memoir of Emerson has yet been 
written, to add something of value to the composite 
" colossal portraiture " of a great and good man. 

A new study Notwithstanding the many years that 

o/ToUtoi'i Tolstoi has been in the eyes of the 

life and art. public, a fellow countryman, Dmitri 

Merejkowski, has given us the first complete study 
of the great Russian. In his book, which now ap- 
pears in an English translation with the title 
"Tolstoi as Man and Artist" (Putnam), he has 
treated the subject from a new psychological point 
of view ; he has analyzed the various traits of the 
man, traced the growth of his character with detail 
and precision, and described the events and meth- 
ods of a long career. The author points out that 
in Russian society, and to some extent among critics, 
the opinion has taken root that about 1878 there 
took place in Tolstoi a moral and religious change, 
— a change which radically transformed not only 
the whole of his own life, but also his intellectual 
and literary activity. In the first period he was 
looked upon only as a great writer ; in the second, 
he shook off the trammels of historical life and 
culture. Today some say he is a Christian cham- 
pion ; others, an atheist ; others a fanatic ; others 
still that he is a sage who has attained the highest 
moral illumination, and, like Socrates, Buddha, and 
Confucius, become the founder of a new religion. 
It is to the second period of his life that the present 
author has devoted particular attention. From our 
own reading of Tolstoi we believe that at heart he 
concedes that the principle of authority ( whether it 
be the Catholic principle of Church authority, or the 
Protestant principle of Scriptural authority) is no 
longer competent to subjugate the sceptical temper 
of the age ; and he insists, not altogether unreason- 
ably, that if we are to continue regarding Christian- 
ity as a veritable divine institution, we must bestir 
ourselves to find an enduring basis for it in the ac- 
knowledged truths of human nature and human 
science. What the follower of Tolstoi demands of 
the Church is some assured, not any probable or 



tentative, knowledge of God ; that is to say, he de- 
mands a revelation of the divine name ample to 
conciliate not merely the spiritual but the rational, 
and even the sensuous, homage of mankind. And 
by attempting to aid his imagination by any spec- 
iousness of ratiocination, you simply encourage fur- 
ther intellectual doubt. Mr. Merejkowski, in por- 
traying his subject's life, has endeavored to show 
where intellectual power fails, and where lies the 
peculiar greatness of the man. His analysis is 
thrown into relief throughout by bringing it into 
comparison with the extraordinary contrast of the 
career and work of Dostoievski, whose birth, cir- 
cumstances, art, ideals, and character were nearly 
antithetic to those of Tolstoi. The author has per- 
formed his work conscientiously ; there has been 
no improper discrimination, such as selections from 
private correspondence, yet nothing is omitted 
which would tend to develop the real character of 
the man. In fact, the book is commendable be- 
cause of its lucidity and directness of argument, as 
well as for its comprehensiveness of scope. 

Thetioryof ^""^ "The Life and Career of Major 

Major Andri John Andr^," Mr. Winthrop Sar- 

agam re-told. gent, too soon carried away from 

his labors in the fields of historical research, has 
pictured one of the most interesting episodes in the 
War of the Revolution. The record of Andre's 
youth, with its many friendships and its one passion, 
has brought many to the conclusion that the coun- 
try's cause would have been better served had Ar- 
nold's neck been slipped into Andre's noose. The 
story of the unfortunate victim of military necessity 
begins with love that resulted in disappointment. 
We are given glimpses of noted people with whom 
he was in friendly relation, whose characters are 
painted with clever strokes, the light and shade of 
each being well preserved : Miss Anna Seward 
("Julia," as she called herself in her lively letters); 
the Corinna of Lichfield, a few of whose stilted 
heroic lines have picked their way down to poster- 
ity in virtue of the events and characters with which 
they dealt ; Richard Lovell Edgeworth, who carried 
off the object of Andre's attachment, the fair Honora 
Sneyd ; the fascinating Honora herself, who made 
everybody in love with her, and, as she could not 
love everybody, by her refusal sent poor "cher 
Jean " (Andr^) to the wars, to become a convicted 
spy and die a felon's death — a death which was 
commemorated by a stately monument in West- 
minster Abbey, and by the removal of the remains 
to that sepulchre of kings. The author touches 
upon the events of history with scrupulous fidelity. 
The incidents which led to the situation where 
Arnold's treason brought him into relation with 
Andr^, — the intrigues, the indiscretions, the blun- 
ders that ended so disastrously, — are so recorded 
as to make the work at once " a romance, a tragedy, 
and a passage of history." Mr. Sargent's style is 
not marked by brilliancy, but he was an industrious 
and painstaking writer ; he possessed candor and

fearlessnesB, and snpported his position by a strong 
an ay of authorities. As a work of reference, his 
Tolume is valuable; in fact, it embodies all that 
can be required by one who is desirous of having a 
clear notion of one of the most painfully interest- 
ing parts of American history, and of forming just 
eoDciasiong concerning the motives of the actors in 
the doleful tragedy. The present handsome new 
edition of Mr. Sargent's work is well edited by 
Mr. William Abbatt, who is also its publisher ; and 
it contains portraits of Andi^ and Sargent. 

It is an atmosphere of breezy geni- 
ality that we enter in opening Mr. 
Charles Warren Stoddard's " Exits 
and Entrances " (Lothrop). He takes life heartily, 
and delights to reproduce, in lively colors, the more 
significant bits of his varied experience in many 
lands. His opening chapter, and his best one, treats 
of Robert Louis Stevenson, with whom he was inti- 
mate in San Francisco. Mr. Stoddard's den in that 
city is immortalized in " The Wrecker." In fact, 
the story of their friendship is given in detail in 
that novel, in the chapter called " Faces on the City 
Front." Some of Stevenson's clever and amusing 
impromptu verses enliven Mr. Stoddard's pages. 
Other interesting personal items relate to Bret 
Harte, Mark Twain, Charles Kingsley, Joaquin 
Miller, — and George Eliot ; for, as a young Amer- 
ican visiting London, he enjoyed the rare privilege 
of being admitted to one of the Sunday afternoons 
at the Priory. Travel sketches, from Jerusalem to 
Hawaii, help to swell this pleasant volume. In 
fact, rather too many of its pages are pen-pictures, 
delightful to the writer, no doubt, and recalling 
delicious memories of dear departed days, but less 
enthralling to the cold-blooded reader. The chief 
fault, indeed, of Mr. Stoddard's style lies in his 
constant striving for the picturesque, at the expense 
of terseness and restraint. Shunning the common- 
place, he occasionally leaves common-sense also be- 
hind, and achieves the nonsensical, as when he 
speaks of " the tart dews of dusk " and '* the im- 
possible Southern moon." His syntax is not im- 
peccable. He indulges in the dangling participle. 
A more heart-rending instance of a lonesome par- 
ticiple with no protecting noun or pronoun in sight. 
to which to attach itself, could hardly be imagined 
than the following, referring to Mr. Stoddard's 
first meeting with Joaquin Miller: '-Having warned 
me of his approach, I was on the lookout." This, 
from a university professor of English literature, 
is a bit startling. 

Tmg—ditvu- "^^ '■■* three of the promised ten 
mrntat/Trntu Tolumes of "The Burton Holmes Lec- 
t'arOtevtA. tures"(Litt]e-Preston Co.) have come 

to hand, and the impression made at the beginning 
of the publication of this fine series is strengthened 
by their examination. But the recommendation to 
accompany the work and conclude it with a complete 
and thoroagh index has not been taken, and the 
failure deprives the entire ten volumes of mneh of 



their potential efficiency as works of reference. The 
plan of the initial volumes is preserved throughout, 
each containing three lectures. Of the volumes un- 
der consideration, the eighth deals with St. Peter- 
burg, Moscow, and the Trans-Siberian Railway as 
far as Stryetensk ; the ninth with the voyage down 
the Amur and the arrival at Vladivostok, the city 
of Peking as known to strangers, and the secret or 
forbidden city ; and the tenth with Seoul, the capi- 
tal of Corea, the country-side in Japan, and the 
Japanese cities of Tokyo and Kyoto. Each lecture 
is preceded by a colored frontispiece of artistic 
worth, and the number of reproduced photographs 
is nothing less than astonishing, their quality and 
interest considered. It is but right to mention, in 
closing an account of this admirable series of books, 
that they show the latest developments in the vari- 
ous processes of book manufacture, and most ade- 
quately clothe the well-told narratives of engrossing 
journeys over the earth. 



Altie^ 



The "Journal of Arthur Stirling" 
(Appleton ) is in some respects a re- 
markable performance, but vexatious 
withal. The newspaper death-notice copied in the 
preface, — " Stirling : By suicide in the Hudson 
River, poet and man of genius, in the twenty-second 
year of his age," — gives a suspicion of clap-trap to 
the whole. Nevertheless the story has power. The 
berating which this " poet and man of genius " gives 
the publishers because they will not publish his 
poem - The Captive," which he has brought forth 
with such agony of soul, is hysterical and some- 
times ill-tempered. "A publisher is not in the busi- 
ness for the furtherance of Art, or for the uplifting 
of humanity, or for the worship of God." That is 
his final quarrel with the world. He is too great a 
man. it seems, to compromise with life, or even with 
religion. " The sublime duty of being damned is 
ever my reply to theological impertinences." Alto- 
gether this journal intime is youthful, egotistic, 
perfervid, one inclines to say impossible ; yet its 
intensity has the air of genuineness, and it is pro- 
foundly in earnest in its devotion to art. It is so 
good — or it might easily have been so good — that 
the clap-trap is unbearable, because unnecessary. 
The story might have been told truly, and a little 
more calmly, and it would have earned a place 
among the well-read tales of unappreciated genius.

Mr. Alexander Teixera de Mattos 
has reason to congratulate himself 
upon the successful issue of his mon- 
umental labor of translation. With the recent pub- 
lication of Volumes V. and VI.. the first adequate 
English version of Chateaubriand's " M^moires 
d'outre Tombe" is completed (Putnam). Neither 
Chateaubriand's {>ersonality nor his style changed 
appreciably in the thirty years during which he pre- 
pared his Memoirs, and there is consequently little 
to say of these volumes that has not already been 
said of the other four (see The Diai< for Jane 



312 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



16, 1902). The last few books are like the first few, 
— less crowded than the middle portions with refer- 
ences to obscure contemporaries, full of picturesque 
description of long journeys taken in behalf of the 
exiled Bourbons, of literary and historical associa- 
tions connected with the cities visited, of dubious 
reflections upon the decline of monarchy in Europe, 
and ardent expressions of attachment to the old 
rSgime. It is to the old rSgime that Chateaubriand 
belongs, whether as statesman, writer, or philoso- 
pher ; and his vogue is past. But his charm is 
enduring. Vain, and a, poseur, he may be; but he 
is admirable even in his affectations. It is typical 
of him that his cat, Micelto, was brought up in 
the folds of a papal robe. And his kings, even to 
poor Charles X., are re-crowned with a halo of 
romance before he is done with them. A great man, 
truly ; and his great book furnishes us with the clue 
to his fascinating personality. No one will ever 
attempt to write Chateaubriand's biography ; Mr. 
de Mattos has therefore done English literature a 
great service by his painstaking and thoroughly ex- 
cellent translation of the Memoirs. 



In his little volume on " Greek and 
iuditcipUt. Roman Stoicism, and Some of Its 

Disciples " (H. B. Turner & Co.) 
Dr. Charles H. Stanley Davis can hardly be said to 
have done full credit to his various degrees and 
the manifold learned societies to which he belongs. 
The book is not an adequate exposition of Stoicism 
as such, nor does it present a sufficient portrayal 
of the individual Stoics who are considered. The 
book is careless in its grammatical structure, and 
still worse in its rhetoric. Freemen for freedmen, 
SkXxA presentiments for presentments, may be passed 
as errors of the type-setter ; Laertius for Laelius 
can hardly be let off so easily. But what shall we 
say when the noted embassy of philosophers who 
came to Rome in the year 155 B. C. are made to 
associate with the poet Lucretius, born some fifty 
years later? Dr. Davis seems somewhat at sea 
too, as to the make- up and purpose of this fa- 
mous embassy. The Latinist will groan over a ref- 
erence to the " De Officia " of Cicero. On the 
whole, the book impresses one as indicating that 
its author has had quite too many irons in the fire 
for successful work. 



Correipondence of !« accord with the line of activity 
colonial governors chosen by many of the patriotic so- 
0/ Rhode Island, pigjigg ^f America, the Rhode Island 
Society of Colonial Dames has undertaken the 
publication of the correspondence of the Colonial 
Governors of that colony from 1723 to 1775 
(Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). The first volume is now 
published, covering the years between 1723 and 
1746. A second volume is to complete the work. 
The preface announces that the correspondence of 
the sixty- four years prior to 1729 has "completely 
disappeared." The sources of Colonial history here 
disclosed have been inaccessible to students remote 



from the written archives of the state ; hence their 
appearance in print confers a public benefit. For- 
tunately, the manuscripts have not been edited, 
but retain their original wording and spelling. The 
annotation, by Mrs. Gertrude Selwyn Kimball is 
laudably brief and apparently correct. A number 
of portraits of early Governors lends a pleasant 
aspect to the work. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. Philip Schuyler Allen and James Taft Hat- 
field have edited, and the University of Chicago Press 
has published, a diary kept by the German poet Wilhelm 
Miiller, and discovered by the late Max Miiller among 
his father's papers. The text as here given is described 
as a " diplomatic " reproduction of the manuscript, 
which we take to mean that personalities have been 
omitted, and perhaps other changes made. There are 
also printed a series of the poet's letters, written be- 
tween 1816 and 1827, and the entire matter is carefully 
annotated and indexed. There is also a portrait. The 
diary is only a fragment, covering about a year, but it 
is of considerable literary and historical interest, and its 
publication is creditable alike to editors and publishers. 

Professor James Harvey Robinson is the author of 
" An Introduction to the History of Western Europe," 
prepared for secondary schools, and published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. It extends from the barbarian invasions and 
the breaking-up of the Western Empire to the close of 
the nineteenth century. Its chief aims are thus stated: 
" Institutions under which Europe has lived for cen- 
turies, above all the Church, have been discussed with a 
good deal more fulness than is usual in similar manuals. 
The life and work of a few men of indubitably first-rate 
importance have been treated with care proportionate 
to their significance for the world. Not only the po- 
litical, but also the economic, intellectual, and artistic 
achievements of the past form an integral part of the 
narrative." In spite of the omission of much of the tra- 
ditional matter, this programme requires a larger hook 
than usual, and there are upwards of seven hundred 
pages, including many pictures and an extensive series 
of maps. 

" Representative Art of Our Time " is the subject of 
the latest and most ambitions of the popular art publi- 
cations emanating from the office of " The Studio " 
(John Lane). The work is issued in eight monthly 
parts, three of which are now ready. Each part con- 
tains half a dozen plates, separately printed and mounted 
ou heavy paper, and by way of text an authoritative 
short essay on some phase of modern art activity. The il- 
lustrations, many of them made especially for this work, 
are representative of nearly every medium used in the 
modern graphic arts. In the case of etchings, lithographs, 
woodcuts, etc., the print is made directly from the artist's 
block. The collection thus brought together, while some- 
what uneven in quality, is of great interest, and contains 
a few really fine plates — as for instance Mr. Max 
Pietschmann's mezzotint, "The Bather." With the final 
part the editor, Mr. Charles Holme, will supply an in- 
troduction, giving among other matter an account of the 
various processes employed in the production of the il- 
lustrations. Published at the moderate price of a dollar 
a part, the work should make a strong appeal to every- 
one interested in current art.

Mr. George H. Ellwanger is one of the many antho- 
logists who have chosen love for their theme, and has 
gathered together out of the treasure house of English 
poetry a volume of songs in praise of the master pas- 
sion of haman life. " Love's Old Sweet Song " is the 
title of this collection, which is published by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. It is based upon an earlier col- 



lection of the same character, also edited by Mr. Ell- 
wanger, and entitled " Love's Demesne." The selec- 
tions are mostly modem, and the majority of them are 
from living poets. 

Professor A. S. Hill's " Beginnings of Rhetoric and 
Composition," published by the American Book Co., 
belongs to this anthor's well-known series of text-books, 
and follows their general method. It is a larger book 
than the " Foundations," and is designed for the use of 
secondary schools. 

" The Gay Gordons," published by Mr. Albert Shnltz, 
Staunton, Va , is a booklet containing sundry ballads of

readers. McClure, Phillips & Co. are the publishers. 

Messrs. E. P. Dntton & Co. are the American pub- 
lishers of a " Home and School Library," consisting of 
small volumes of an instructive sort. An essay on 
" Plato's Republic " by Professor Lewis Campbell, and 
a book on the "First Makers of England" (Cesar, 
Arthur, and Alfred) by Lady Magnus, are the opening 
volumes of this series. 

" Crvpts of the Heart " is the title finally selected for 
Mr. James Lane Allen's new novel which the Macmil- 
lan Co. will publish in June. During the following 
month this firm will issue Mr. Winston Churchill's new 
novel, the title of which is not yet announced; and a 
book to which the readers of " Oldfield " will look for- 
ward with pleasure, — " Round Anvil Rock " by Mrs. 
Nancy Huston Banks. 

Professor Gilbert Murray is the editor of the " Eu- 
ripides " volume in Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co.'s 
series called "The Athenian Drama." The plays 
translated are " Hippolytus " and " The Baecha," and 
" The Frogs " of Aristophanes is added by way of illus- 
tration. Rhyming verse is the form chosen for the trans- 
lation, which is unusually felicitious. The critical 
introduction is noteworthy, and the volume has many 
notes and pictures. 

A volume of "English Poems from Chaucer to Kip- 
ling," edited for school use by Messrs. ThomM Mare 
Parrott and Augustus White Long, is published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. The book is aimed at the needs of

interests of young students, providing for them the best 
poetry that they are likely to appreciate. There are 
three hundred pages of text and a hnndred of notes, 
besides an introduction. 

Professor William Henry Goodyear has for several 
years been collecting evidence in proof of the proposition 
that many mediseval Italian churches have walls that 
were intentionally made to lean outwards. This evi- 
dence, with many illustrative plans and photographs, is 
now collected into a pamphlet called " The Architectural 
Refinements of St. Mark's at Venice," and published by 
the Macmillan Co. for the Brooklyn Institute of Arts 
and Sciences. The resolt is an extremely interesting 
architectural study, in which the author seems to make 
out a clear ease 'or his proposition. In other words, the 
same artistic instinct which led the Greek temple build-

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. publish a " Young 
People's History of Holland" by Mr. William E. 
Griffis. Professor Freeman used to say that the way to 
write a small history was to write a large one first, and 
Mr. GrifSs, who has written much about Holland on 
previous occasions, now exemplifies this saying by bring- 
ing his wide acquaintance with the subject to bear upon 
this simple and elementary work, which is pleasantly 
written and interestingly illustrated from old prints. 

" A Descriptive Guide to the Best Fiction, British 
and American " (Macmillan) compiled by Mr. Ernest 
A. Baker, is (l volume containing nearly five thousand 
references, classified according to countries and periods, 
briefly but helpfully annotated, and elaborately indexed. 
The usefulness of such a work needs no exposition, and 
Mr. Baker deserves the hearty thanks of librarians, 
teachers, and general readers for having given them 
this inclusive and conscientious bibliography. Although 
of English origin, the work by no means neglects 
American fiction, and, while we might supply many 
missing titles of importance, we are on the whole sur- 
prised by the completeness and modernity of the Amer- 
ican list. 

There have been so many recent editions of Carlyle's 
" French Revolution " that we have completely lost 
track of them. The three-volume edition, edited by 
Mr. John Holland Rose and published by the Macmillan 
Co., is, however, so much more than a mere reprint that 
it deserves a word of special mention. It has an intro- 
duction, extensive annotations, and a series of illustra- 
tions, all of which greatly enhance its value, and make 
of it a critical edition that is of real use for the study 
of the subject. The illustrations are portraits, plans, 
and reproductions of old prints, many of them of the 
highest interest. Mr. Rose is a competent scholar, 
and this edition may be confidently recommended to 
students of French history. 

The plans and programme for the Emerson Memorial 
School which is to be held in Boston and Concord in 
July are nearly perfected. The school will open on 
Monday, July 13, immediately after the close of the 
National Educational Convention in Boston, and con- 
tinue three weeks. There will be thirty lectures, cov- 
ering the various aspects of Emerson's life and work. 
The morning lectures will be given in Concord and 
the evening lectures in Boston. Two afternoons will 
be devoted to Memories of Emerson by men and 
women who were personal friends of the great thinker ; 
and there will be throughout the period of the school 
special Sunday services, with sermons or addresses 
by eminent lovers of Emerson. Detailed informa- 
tion concerning tickets and other points will be fur- 
nished by the secretary of the committee, Mr. David 
Greene Haskins, Jr., 5 Tremont Street, Boston. The 
following partial list of the lectures and lecturers will 
give an idea of the broad character and scope of the 
school: President J. G. Schurman, "The Philosophy 
of Emerson "; Frank B. Sanborn, " Emerson and the 
Concord School of Philosophy "; Rev. S. M. Crothers, 
" The Poetry of Emerson "; William M. Salter, " Em- 
erson's Aim and Method in Social Reform"; Rev. 
Charles F. Dole, " Emerson the Puritan "; Dr. Edward

"The Sphinx"; William Lloyd Garrison, "Emerson 
and the Anti-Slavery Movement"; Moorfield Storey, 
"Emerson and the Civil War"; Rev. B. F. True- 
blood, " Emerson and the Inner Light "; Rev. John W. 
Chadwick, " The Simpler Emerson "; Henry D. Lloyd, 
"Emerson's Wit and Humor"; Percival Chubb, "Em- 
erson's Spiritual Leadership in England"; Prof. Kuno 
Francke, " Emerson's Debt to Germany and Germany's 
Debt to Emerson"; George Willis Cooke, " Emerson 
andthe Transcendental Movement " ; William R. Thayer, 
" Emerson's Gospel of Individualism"; Prof. Charles 
F. Richardson, " Emerson's Place in American Litera- 
ture"; Rabbi Charles Fleischer, "Emerson, the Seer 
of Democracy "; Rev. Chas E. Jefferson, " Emerson and 
Carlyle "; Rev. R. Heber Newton, " Emerson the Man."

The scene of Mr. Babcock's new novel is laid in the Chesapeake Bay, and several of the chief characters are descendants of the 
William Claiborne who figures in his former book, but the time is that of the Civil War. There is a curious psychological problem of 
inherited memory involved in the plot which is sure to attract attention and interest.

heredity of memory." — Pittsburg Dispatch. 

"An interesting narrative."— Pu6/ic Opinum, N, Y. 

" A readable book with touches of brilliancy." — N. Y. Times Saturday Revieic.

This is a thrilling story of some very interesting phases of Russian life by one who knows his subject thoroughly, having been born 
and passed his early years in the Russian province of which he writes. It will be found of absorbing interest and of much sociological value. 

" A romance, yet it is a great deal more than that. It is history, philosophy and romance combined." — Philadelphia Record. 

" A powerful protest and an effective story." — Philadelphia Press. 

*' Is told with such passion that, having once taken it up, one cannot fail to read it.** — Louisville Post.

A NEW EDITION OF SHAKSPERE'S WORKS WITH CRITICAL 

TEXT IN ELIZABETHAN ENGLISH AND BRIEF NOTES 

ILLUSTRATIVE OF ELIZABETHAN LIFE 

THOUGHT AND IDIOM 

By 

MARK HARVEY LIDDELL 



Edition de Luxe 
limited to 250 
sets. 



The most beau- 
tiful American 
book thus far. 



Mr. Theodore L. DeVinne writes: "I regard these books" (the 
VARIORUM FITZ GERALD and ELIZABETHAN SHAKS- 
PERE), "and especially the Sbakspere, as my best workmanship in 

typography." 



1. It is the most beautiful set of books ever issued from an American press. 

2. A new type, modeled from that used by the Venetian printer, Franz Renner, in his Qnadragesiraale, 1472. It is 
considered superior to the Jensen adopted by William Morris, and reproduces the highest achieTement of fifteenth- 
century design. Mr. DeVinne had it cut to show that beauty and legibility depend not so much on blackness or 
thickness of type-stems as on instant visibility of every line. 

3. A style of composition in which the notes form a complementary frame to the page — nsed by early printers for 
their finest annotated classics, but abandoned till now on account of its mechanical difficulties and expense. 

4. The proportions of type to a page and the series of facing pages have been stndied and adapted from the best 
work of the great Cologne printer, Henry Qnentell. 

5. The text is in 14 point, instantly legible and restfnl to the eye, while the notes are much larger than is nsual 
in Sbakspere editions. 

6. The notes read continuously, and are on the same pag« as the text. All citations are also given on the 
page. The reader gets Shakspere's thought in the light of modem scholarship, without leaving his 
library chair. . ■ x i^ 

7. Each volume has a brief introduction containing the essential facts relative to the date of composition, 
sources, plot, characters, and literary features of the play. 

8. Each scene has an introductory note outlining the action, and each act is followed by a summary 
of the play up to the following act. -'^ A" 

9. An elaborate index, in itself a dictionary, enables the student to group together the various •' *" 
pecidiar features or to find meanings or idioms that interest him. TTie sixty colunms of wy^ 
index in MACBETH are a storehouse of inestimable value. If one wishes, for instance, .^J 
to known what words in this play have been amended by different editors, he merely 
turns to page 235, where, under " Emendations," is a list with full references. ^^ 
There has never been any similar feature of a Sbakspere so ingeniously devised - ^i' 
and so thoroughly worked out. 

10. In a word this is the perfect Sbakspere thus far — remarkable in beauty and 
in ease of reading. The average man cannot read the plays intelligently 
without it. With it, he needs nothing else : no dictionaries to consult, 
no grammars to refer to, not even cross-references to look up.

By C. A. STRONG, Professor of Psychology in Columbia University.

a book which, though perfectly lucid, is neither light nor superficial. Cloth, 8vo, $2.50 net (postage 16 cents).

LIST OF N'EW BOOKS 344 



Upon several occasions daring the past 
twelve years we have spwken of the work done 
by the Chicago Orchestra under the scholarly 
and exacting leadership of Mr. Theodore 
Thomas, and of the self-sacrificing devotion of 
the small group of pablic-spirited men and 
women whose generous contributions have 
made possible the continued existence of this 
organization for the higher musical education 
of the public. The American city which above 
most others is given up to tlie spirit of com- 
mercialism would be in evil case before the bar 
of judgment were it not for a few such agencies 
as this Orchestra, which advertise to the world 
that we are not altogether given up to the pur- 
suit of gain. Time was when Chicago had for 
exhibition to its visitors from abroad nothing 
more inspiring than its Board of Trade and ito 
Stock Yards ; having seen these, oar visitors 
had seen what was most typical of the city, and 
were suffered to depart, not exactly in peace, 
but with the recollection of a startling and 
unique experience. We have changed all this 
during the last ten years. The new era began 
with the World's Fair of 1893, for we then 
made the discovery that there might be matter 
of greater interest to visitors than the slaughter 
of cattle and the antics of frenzied speculators 
in wheat and corn. Strangers were still politely 
curious about these things, but somehow they 
seemed to receive deeper impressions from the 
exhibit of modem paintings and the Congress 
of Religions. Our grain elevators and oar 
operations in beef and pork became less inter- 
esting for the nonce than our strivings after 
beauty and truth. 

It was an interesting crisis in our civic life, 
and its lessons were taken to heart. The ten 
years that have passed since Chicago invited 
the world to an exhibit in which, for the first 
time in her history, the ideal was made more 
prominent than the material, have witnessed 
a constant broadening of our horizon, and a 
steadily increasing interest in those things that 
make for the higher life of mankind. The ma- 
terial basis remains — it always must remain, — 
but there is now a creditable ideal superstrno-

ture, and it shares in the pride with which we 
view the sum total of our achievements. The 
claims of education, and of art, and of litera- 
ture, are now freely allowed in quarters where 
they were but grudgingly admitted a few years 
ago, and along with this quickening of our civic 
consciousness in the direction of aspiration and 
aesthetic endeavors there has come into the 
grosser atmosphere of our political life a puri- 
fying influence that has already accomplished 
wonders of reform, and is full of promise for 
the future. 

Among the civilizing agencies that have 
been working this gradual but very real change 
none has stood higher than the Chicago Or- 
chestra, and it was a severe shock to the culti- 
vated public to be told, as we were about two 
months ago, that the continued existence of the 
organization was doubtful. For twelve years 
now Chicago has been accustomed to its regu- 
lar annual season of twenty or more concerts, 
each given twice, and it is not easy to contem- 
plate the possibility of getting along without 
their uplifting influence. The announcement 
made by the trustees of the organization was 
to the effect that the yearly deficit continued to 
be large, that the number of men willing to 
assume it was growing smaller all the time, 
and that unless the public should step in and 
take this burden from their shoulders, they 
would be compelled to give up the undertak- 
ing as hopeless. An appeal was made for an en- 
dowment of three-quarters of a million dollars, 
which amount would suffice to purchase a lot 
and erect a building that should be the per- 
manent home of the Orchestra. With the owner- 
ship of such a piece of property, the Orchestra 
could safely count upon making both ends meet 
in the future, besides having greatly enlarged 
opportunities for the furtherance of its work. 

The situation, as developed by twelve years 
of experience, appears to be that the public 
may be counted upon to pay three-fourths of 
the cost of the concerts each year, but that the 
other fourth must come from an endowment or 
from some form of annual subsidy. This is 
really a remarkable showing, for it means an 
average attendance of nearly twenty-five hun- 
dred paying listeners, twice every week, at a 
series of concerts strictly educational and cul- 
tural in purpose, under the leadership of a man 
whose standards are of the highest, and who 
will not make the slightest concession to an 
unthinking popular demand. To give the pub- 
lic the music that it needs, instead of the music 
that it thinks it wants, has always been the 



guiding principle in the distinguished career of 
Mr. Thomas, and he has put this principle into 
practice more uncompromisingly than ever be- 
fore during these twelve years of his Chicago 
leadership. The Chicago Orchestra must not 
for a moment be classed with institutions or- 
ganized for the purpose of entertainment. If 
it were that, one might reasonably demand 
that it justify its existence by becoming self- 
supporting. But we must rank it with such 
institutions as universities and libraries and 
art museums, that no one expects to be self- 
supporting, and that would lose something of 
their dignity were they wholly dependent upon 
the returns for the services which they render. 
Thus viewed, the fact that the Orchestra calls 
for no larger endowment than will provide for 
one-fourth of its running expenses brings a 
highly significant tribute to the educational 
value of the work that it has accomplished. 

Two months ago, it was proclaimed that un- 
less the necessary sum were subscribed within 
a few weeks, the organization would be dis- 
banded, and the men who had so generously 
supported it would give up their thankless task. 
It was for the public to show its appreciation 
of their work by coming forward and relieving 
them of the burden. To this appeal the public 
has responded generously, and in the space of 
about two months considerably more than half 
of the needed sum has been pledged by several 
thousand subscribers. The expression of pop- 
ular interest thus given has proved so grati- 
fying that the trustees have been persuaded to 
modify their original resolution, to make con- 
tracts for another season of concerts under the 
old conditions, and to trust that a year of fur- 
ther effort will complete the required endow- 
ment, and place the Orchestra beyond the need 
of further help. They have announced as their 
ultimatum that unless the endowment is thus 
completed during the coming year they will 
make no further effort to continue the work of 
the organization. In that case, the thirteenth 
season will prove the last, and those who put 
their faith in omens will wag their heads saga- 
ciously at this new confirmation of a pet super- 
stition. 

We cannot bring ourselves to believe that 
such will be the outcome of an enterprise in 
every way so praiseworthy. While the issue 
will remain in doubt as long as any considerable 
fraction of the required amount is unpledged, 
the situation may certainly be described as en- 
couraging. The success of the undertaking will 
mean much to the higher interests of Chicago.

It will secure us in the possession of a body of 
masicians whose training has now reached so 
high a degree of excellence that it may safely 
challenge comparison with any similar body in 
the world. It will secure to us also the closing 
years — and may they be many — of a con- 
ductor whose single-minded devotion to his art 
has been beyond all praise, and has made him 
one of the greatest benefactors of our age. It 
will give dignity to both band and leader by 
transferring them from rented quarters, with 
all the obvious inconveniences thereon attend- 
ant, to a noble building consecrated in perpe- 
tuity to one of the noblest of the arts. And it 
will give to the Orchestral Association oppor- 
tunities hitherto denied them for the extension 
of their work. This aspect of the case, perhaps 
the most important of all, has not been given 
its due prominence in the recent discussion of 
the subject. The Orchestra will then be able 
to supply the public with all the concerts for 
which there shall be an effective demand. 
Elxceptionally attractive programmes may be 
repeated, additional series of concerts less se- 
verely classical may be provided for, and the 
old fashion of summer concerts, which we have 
missed for many years, may be restored under 
almost ideal conditions. We now look forward 
with measurable confidence to the realization 
of all these good things in the near future, for 
we need fear only the apathy which sometimes 
follows upon enthusiastic effort for a worthy 
end, and defeats the most promising plans in the 
hour of their seeming achievement. That this 
disaster may not overtake the foundation now 
so nearly laid must be the prayer of every lover 
of music and every friend of the higher cult- 
ure in this country. 



EMEBSOX AS A PUBLIC SPEAKER. 

To win fame by spoken as well as by written 
words has been the fortane of comparatively few 
men of letters. Distiogaiehed scholars may be 
Btimalating in the college class-room, bat on the 
popular lecture-platform their manners are often 
too academic, their terms too technical, to win en- 
thasiaem. An author of repate is always a gaest 
of honor, bat one is often disappointed in listening 
to his lectures or reading ; while popular lectures 
in published form seldom deserve to rank as litera- 
ture of a high gjade. 

Emerson had qualities of mind and temperament 
which charmed both listeners and readers. Be- 
versing the usaal sequence, he gained fame as a 
lecturer before he addressed the public as an author, i 



The gnccessful sale of his later volumes resulted, to 
a large extent, from his lectures in his own country 
and in England. Without any hint of disparage- 
ment of their literary quality, it must be granted that 
the noble benignity of Emerson's personality and 
voice largely increased the popularity of his published 
works. From earliest manhood he recognized that 
be was ■' a man with a message." While teaching, 
true selfhood was, by his confession, " already writ- 
ing in my chamber my first thoughts on morals and 
the beautiful laws of compensation and of individual 
genios which to observe and illustrate have g^ven 
sweetness to many years of my life" (" Emerson in 
Concord," p. 31). 

At first thoQght, especially in his day, the natural 
medium for voicing this message was the pulpit. 
From the first, however, he questioned his fitness 
for a typical New England ministry. He doubted if 
be would have been ordained had he been examined, 
when called to the pulpit of '* the Mather dynasty." 
Even in his first sermon to his people, he warned 
them that he should "insist on elbow-room in preach- 
ing."' This freedom of thought and conscience, 
culminating in open challenge to formal prayers 
and the symbolic eueharist, was never aggressive 
or sensational in expression. Emerson's breadth 
and fearlessness of mind were no less characteristic 
than his humble sincerity and tolerance. These 
qualities, united with rare grace of manner, perva- 
ded his scattered pulpit utterances, from the ordina- 
tion sermon in 1829 to the last sermon, on Worship, 
at Nantucket in 1847. Disappointed in the hope 
that his congregation would accept his radical views 
on modes of religion, he nevertheless advocated 
individual decision and harmony of relationship. 
When he gave the Right Hand of Fellowship to the 
Concord pastor, Mr. Goodwin, in 1830, he used the 
words now found in the rare pamphlet containing 
his brief charge : " Christianity aims to teach the 
perfection of human nature, and eminently, there- 
fore, does it teach the unity of the spirit Bnt it 
speaks first to its own disciples : be of one mind, 
else with what countenance should the church say 
to the world of men, ' love one another.' " 

When the dissolution of his pastorate had been 
completed, with absolute tenderness and regret to 
both pastor and people, he never questioned their 
position nor his own. He took anew the vow of ded- 
ication *' to the love and service of tbe same eternal 
cause, — the advancement, namely, of the kingdom 
of God in the hearts of men." The musical voice 
and gracions manner of this " poet- preacher " re- 
mained an heritage in the memory of his parish- 
ioners through life. His reading of hymns was often 
recalled, — that ability, which he urged on all, to 
'• read sense and poetry " into ideals of life. From 
the liberal attitude of present-day thought, it is 
difficult to realize the tense feeling aroused by his 
quiet non-conformity. While his repugnance to for- 
malism led him to a position where few Christians 
could follow him, in his day or ours, yet doubt and 
gloom were aUens to his mind; he was ever a

consecrated preacher of righteousness. To sincere 
preachers, of whatever denomination, he gave honor. 
Though he was the victim of attack by a few bigoted 
ministers and critics, his personal charm and toler- 
ance, both in the pulpit and outside, won him many 
enthusiastic friends who smiled in covert sympathy 
at Father Taylor's response to hints of Emerson's 
future in perdition, — that " emigration would surely 
tend that way." 

After leaving his church, when a few months of 
foreign travel had scattered the melancholy due to 
this experience and his wife's death, his thoughts 
turned toward another possible mode of expression 
for the messages of moral and spiritual elevation 
which, he felt, demanded utterance. A new sense 
of freedom, of prospective contact with a wider au- 
dience, came upon him. In his journal he wrote : 
"I have sometimes thought that to be a good min- 
ister it was necessary to leave the ministry." And 
again, in attestation of his sincerity of purpose : 
" Henceforth I design not to utter any speech, poem, 
or book, that is not entirely and peculiarly my work. 
I will say, at public lectures, and the like, those things 
which I have meditated for their own sake, and not 
for the first time with a view to that occasion" 
(November 15, 1834 ; " Emerson in Concord," p. 54). 
In these simple words may be read the secret 
of Emerson's success alike in his addresses and 
writings. He was no temporizer, no self-advertising 
sensationalist. He had thoughts to share with his 
audience, ideals gathered from reading and medi- 
tation ; such had inspired him, and might become a 
" divining-rod to their deeper natures." 

In a survey of Emerson's addresses, one finds 
three distinct types, — the oratorical, the scientific 
and biographical, and the literary and ethical. His 
earliest spoken discourses had marked oratorical 
features, yet difEered from the average occasional 
oration by depth of thought. Such were the " His- 
torical Address at Concord " in 1835, " The Amer- 
ican Scholar " before the Phi Beta Kappa in 1837, 
and the "Lecture on the Times" in 1841. While 
this form of speech was less frequent in later years, 
yet there were a few famous orations on record, — 
the " Seventh of March " oration at the New York 
Tabernacle in 1854, " The Fortune of the Republic " 
in Boston in 1863, and the address at the Burns Cen- 
tenary dinner, described by Lowell with unwonted 
enthusiasm as he recalled the magnetism of the 
speaker, — " like an electric spark, thrilling as it 
went, and then exploding in a thunder of plaudits." 

After Emerson had chosen the Lyceum as his im- 
mediate field, his first themes were semi-scientific, 
dealing with fundamentals, and yet seeking to 
inculcate spiritual ideas into technical subjects, as 
in the lecture on Water, at the Boston Mechanics 
Institute (1834), or the contemporaneous addresses 
before the Society of Natural History. Popular lect- 
ures on scientific themes were remunerative at that 
time. He wrote Carlyle of the large sums paid, — 
$3000 to Dr. Spurzheim for a course of Phrenology, 
and a larger sum to Professor Silliman of Yale for 



fifteen lectures on Geology. Emerson soon realized 
two facts, — first, that he was unfitted for treating 
scientific subjects ; and second, that such ventures, 
though temporarily enriching, were "attended by 
a degree of uncertainty." With more zeal, he 
prepared his first course of biographical lectures on 
Michael Angelo, Milton, Luther, Fox, and Burke. 
The first two appeared later in the " North Amer- 
ican Review," but their author did not care to 
preserve them, as he did the later series of 1845. 

After desultory addresses on educational and 
historic themes, Emerson arranged, in November 
1835, for a course of lectures on English Literature, 
at Masonic Temple, Boston, before the Society for 
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. These themes, 
80 well analyzed in the Appendix to Mr. Cabot's 
Memoir, satisfied Emerson that this form of lecture 
offered the best scope for bis poetic and ethical sug- 
gestions. The enthusiasm of his audience, increas- 
ing as the lectures continued, gave him greater 
confidence. While at times he chafed under the 
exactions of time, place, and the whims of a pro- 
miscuous audience, and craved respite from the 
fatigues of journeying, yet his attitude was quite 
unlike that of Carlyle. The latter confessed his 
rebellion at the " bayonets of Necessity " which 
drove him into the lecture-room where his over- 
wrought nerves threatened "a flood of tears and 
blubbering." Emerson, on the other hand, ac- 
knowledged to his friend " a certain delight (base 
also ?) in speaking to a multitude." But he found 
joy in the friends, — "those sacred people" who 
were largely gathered through this means. 

Whatever Emerson's theme might be, in the 
earlier studies of great men or the later thoughts 
on life's abstractions — Culture, Character, Exper- 
ience, Self- Reliance, — he was uniformly popular 
and stimulating. His melodious voice and natural 
ease of manner gained for him his first hold upon 
his audience ; his intellectual and moral earnestness 
tended to cement the kindly relationship thus estab- 
lished. One who recalls the charm of his lectures 
has told me that his characteristic expression has 
been well caught by David Scott in his famous 
painting, — the benign, penetrating eye, with its 
hazy depths, and the easy poise of the body, 
with one hand extended and loosely closed. Ac- 
cording to Mr. Alexander Ireland, the English 
auditors of Emerson, long expectant of his coming, 
were entranced by his winning personality. The 
first impression was of " a manner so singularly 
quiet and unimpassioned that you began to fear the 
beauty and force of his thoughts were about to be 
marred by what might be described as monotony 
of expression. But very soon this apprehension 
dispelled. The mingled dignity, sweetness and 
strength of his features, the earnestness of his man- 
ner and voice, and the evident depth and sincerity 
of his convictions, gradually extorted your deepest 
attention, and made you feel that you were within 
the grip of no ordinary man, but of one ' sprung of 
earth's first blood,' with ' titles manifold.' " With

mannscript by his side, Emerson wag yet so conver- 
sant with his caref ally studied thenae and diction that 
he was able to speak into the eyes as well as the ears 
of his aadienee. A contemporary joamal said : 
'* He has a horror of extempore speaking, . . . and 
a farther horror of reporters, who seize and slanghter 
his fresh atterances." 

There was, however, more than grace of manner 
to gain for Emerson the epithet of Lowell. *' the 
most steadily attractive lecturer in America." The 
mental and moral strength of thoaght were illo- 
mined by a literary form which was all his own. 
The mingling of serenity and fearless force are 
readily noted in his best addresses. Aa an example, 
let ns 'ecall the poetic tenderness, changing to swift 
challenge, in the opening paragraphs of the Divinity 
School Address : '* In this refulgent summer, it 
has been a luxury to draw the breath of life. The 
grass grows, the buds burst, the meadow is spotted 
with fire and gold in the tint of flowers. The air 
is full of birds and sweet with the breath of the 
pine, the balm of Gilead, and the new hay. . . . 
Whenever the pulpit is usurped by a formalist, then 
is the worshipper degraded and disconsolate. We 
shrink as soon as the prayers begin, which do not 
uplift, but smite and offend as." 

In revising his lectures for the published volume, 
Emerson condensed and corrected with exhaustive 
patience. Yet in the preparation of these lectures 
he was never hasty or inconsiderate. Each thought, 
each sentence, was weighed with serapalous exact- 
ness, that the listener might receive its full and 
direct force. Hence arose those terse epigrams 
which Sir Leslie Stephen hag called, in apt analogy, 
" the gnomic atterances which are to the cultivated 
what proverbs are to the vulgar." Despite his 
wonderfal popularity, Emerson had his malcontents 
and critics. There was the Western farmer who 
disconsolately walked oat of the hall, shaking his 
head disapprovingly after listening to a few sen- 
tences, while Emerson's eyes followed him in 
questioning sadness. There were also a few who 
denounced his lectures as illogical and incomplete. 
Such criticism, in large measure, was just ; and to- 
day he would saffer yet more from attacks upon 
his arguments, or his lack of them. " Systems of 
Logic ■' were uninteresting to him ; inconsistency 
was often advocated as a matter of individual np- 
rightness. In the main, his auditors were content, 
as his readers are now, to find delight in the separ- 
ate panicles of his brilliant and stimulating optim- 
ism, without seeking to weave a perfect tissue of 
logic or a complete philosophy of life. To common 
minds, there has ever been a charm in the calm 
courage of this man, who 

" in s plun. pretematnral way. 
Makes masteries matters of mere every-day." 

The noble ideals and sincerity of the man, as 
speaker or writer, surpassed any defects of sequence. 
To his auditors of the past as to his readers of the 
present, Emerson was a vital inspiration for '• the 
life of the spirit." Axkte Rcsseli, Marble.

Nearly twenty years ago the writer of these 
lines was one of a great crowd gathered in the 
hall of the Nataral History Museum in Lon- 
don, to witness the unveiling of the statne of 
Darwin. Conspicuous among those who took 
part in the ceremony were Professor Huxley, 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Prince 
of Wales — now King Edward. In a worldly 
sense, the man who was once so reviled had 
completely triumphed ; but Mr. Huxley touched 
a deeper chord when be declared that the statue 
was not placed there merely to perpetuate 
Darwin's memory, — that ran no risk of obli- 
vion ; neither was it to indicate the official 
sanction of the authorities, — for science recog- 
nised no such sanction. " No," he said, " we 
beg you to cherish this memorial as a symbol 
by which, as generation after generation of 
students enter yonder door, they shall be re- 
minded of the ideal according to which they 
must shape their lives, if they would turn to 
best account the opportunities offered by the 
great institution under your charge." No words 
could be more fitting, and it is with exactly 
the same feeling that we finish the reading of 
the volumes now under review. We are not 
concerned now to praise Darwin's intellect ; we 
are not concerned to defend his theory ; we 
think only with reverence and affection of the 
man who lived the life we would fain live ; who 
showed us, in the midst of a trivial world, what 
our kind is capable of. When such men are 
possible, it is worth while to be a human being! 

It is a Darwinian principle that when in a 
variable species some individuals are better 
fitted than others to live and propagate, these 
will increase and gradually supplant those less 
suited to the environment. Thus what was ex- 
ceptional, once having come into existence, 
mav become normal. So again under condi- 
tions of cultivation, if the gardener can get one 
blue rose, he may in time have all he wants. 
Hence it is that in the lives of noble men we 
see the greatest promise for the human race. 
We cannot raise intellect like turnips, nor can 
we mechanically cultivate the gentle flowers of 
modesty, integrity, and affection ; but we can, 
as a people, so far control our environment that

the best shall come to their own. If all that is 
noble in the human species is permitted to de- 
velop, and worth is the only cause of wealth, 
not only will the race be much bettered for the 
time being, but on good Darwinian principles, it 
will advance. Here is our opportunity : how 
are we using it ? 

These remarks are suggested by the ob- 
vious reflection that but for the possession of 
inherited wealth, Darwin would have been 
practically lost to the world. His continual 
ill-health would have made it difficult for him 
to have earned any sort of a living, and out of 
the question to do in addition any scientific 
work. For twenty years he studied evolution, 
before he was willing to publish ; and all this 
while he would have been considered to be 
wasting his time, according to the opinion of 
the day. His books were eventually a source of 
revenue, but for many years his conduct was 
exactly the reverse of that necessary for 
"getting on." That one of the greatest men 
the world has ever produced was not utterly 
crushed and annihilated, is seen to be the re- 
sult of what may fairly be termed an accident. 
With the most favorable conditions, we cannot 
expect to produce many like Darwin ; but it is 
to be feared that we are criminally blind and 
extravagantly wasteful. 

Some idea of Darwin's continual ill-health 
may be gathered from frequent passages in the 
letters ; for example : 

" My health is better than it was a few years ago, 
but I never pass a day without much discomfort and 
the sense of •xtreme fatigue " (letter 286; 1878). 

" My health is considerably improved, so that I am 
able to work nearly two hours a day " (letter 363 ; 1866) . 

One could not help marvelling at the thought of 
what Darwin would have done if he had enjoyed 
robust health ; but then the question arose, 
how could a man have done more than he did ? 
Upon closer consideration, I believe that in a 
certain sense Darwin's great power was partly 
the result of his ill-health, which so greatly re- 
duced his power of doing active work. Though 
he may nominally have worked only a few hours 
each day, at other times his mind was not idle, 
and he had ample time for reflection. From 
what we now know of the human mind, it is im- 
possible to doubt that even his moments of idle- 
ness and mere musing were often moments of 
illumination. I believe we destroy as much 
talent by submerging it in the details of active 
work, as by neglecting its existence. 

Darwin's ideas upon education are of much 
interest to us. Of course a passage in a letter 



must not always be regarded as expressing a 
settled opinion, but the following sentences are 
at least significant : 

" I am one of the root and branch men, and would 
leave classics to be learnt by those alone who have suf- 
ficient zeal and the high taste requisite for their appre- 
ciation. ... I was at school at Shrewsbury under a 
great scholar, Dr. Butler; I learnt absolutely nothing, 
except by amusing myself by reading and experimenting 
in chemistry. Dr. Butler somehow found this out, and 
publicly sneered at me before the whole school for such 
gross waste of time" (letter 774; 1867). 

" I really think you cannot go on better, for edu- 
cational purposes, than you are now doing — observing, 
thinking and some reading beat, in ray opinion, all sys- 
tematic education" (letter 646, to J. Scott, 1863). 

Closely connected with this topic are his views 
on English style, and the letter just quoted 
continues : 

" Do not despair about your style. ... I never stndy 
style; all that I do is to try to get the subject as clear as 
I can in my own bead, and express it in the commonest 
language which occurs to me. But I generally have to 
think a good deal before the simplest arrangement and 
words occur to me." 

Again (letter 151; 1862): 

" It is a golden rule always to use, if possible, a 
short old Saxon word. Such a sentence as ' so purely 
dependent is the incipient plant on the specific morpho- 
logical tendency ' does not sound to my ears like good 
mother English — it wants translating." 

It seems remarkable to us, who readily ac- 
cept the familiar idea of evolution, that when 
the " Origin of Species " appeared, so many 
talented and competent men should have been 
unable to see its value. Darwin came fully to 
realize the difficulty of changing the trend of 
a well-occupied mind ; in a letter to Wallace 
(letter 442) concerning a difference of opinion 
about protective resemblances he writes : 

" But we shall never convince each other. I some- 
times marvel how truth progresses, so difficult is it for 
one man to convince another, unless bis mind is vacant. 
Nevertheless, I myself to a certain extent contradict 
my own remarks, for I believe far more in the impor- 
tance of protection than I did before reading your 
articles." 

Writing to Alexander Agassiz (letter 498) he 
says : 

" I do hope that you will re-urge your views about 
the reappearance of old characters, for, as far as I can 
judge, the most important views are often neglected 
unless they are urged and re-urged." 

No one was less " cock sure " than Darwin, 
though he could nearly always give good rea- 
sons for his opinions, and would not give them 
up unless convinced by better ones. He writes 
to Wallace in 1868 : " I grieve to differ from 
you, and it actually terrifies me and makes me 
constantly distrust myself " (letter 449). He

had learned by hard experience the difficulty of 
being accurate : he writes to J. Scott (a gar- 
dener who was in a certain sense his pupil) : 

" Accaraey is the soul of Natural History. It is hard 
to become accurate; he who modifies a hair's breadth 
will never be accurate. It is a golden rule, which I 
try to follow, to put every fact which is opposed to one's 
preconceived opinion in the strongest light. Absolute 
accuracy is the hardest merit to attain, and the highest 
merit. Any deviation is ruin" (letter 647). 

The letters, like those in the earlier " Life 
and Letters," reveal throughout the charming 
relations between Darwin and his friends, and 
his unfailing courtesy to all. Often there is a 
playful sally thinly covering a deep and tender 
feeling, as in a letter to Hooker (letter 612) : 

■* Your letter is a mine of wealth, but first I most 
scold yen: I cannot abide to hear you abuse yourself, 
even in joke, and call yourself a stupid dog. You, in 
fact, thus abuse me, because for long years I have 
looked up to you as the man whose opinion I have valued 
more on any scientific subject than any one else in the 
world. I continually marvel at what yon know, and at 
what you do." 

Again to Hooker in 1881 (letter 764) : 

" I cannot but think that you are too kind and civil 
to visitors, and too conscientious about your official work. 
But a man cannot care his virtues, any more than his 
vices, after early youth; so you must bear your bur- 
then. It is, however, a great misfortune for science 
that you hare so very little spare time for the Genera 
[Plantamm]." 

Writing to Huxley in 1868 (letter 208) ke 
says: 

" I never received a note from you in my life with- 
ont pleasure; but whether this wiil be so after you have 
read pangenesis, I am very doubtful. Oh Lord, what 
a blowing up I may receive! I write now partly to say 
that you must not think of looking at my book till the 
summer, when I hope you will read pangenesis, for I 
care for your opinion on such a subject more than for 
that of any other man in Europe. You are so terribly 
sharp-sighted and so confoundedly honest!" 

Darwin's family life was almost ideal ; he 
had the happiness of seeing most of his chil- 
dren grow up and occupy useful places in the 
world, two of them — Francis and George — 
attaining eminence in science. It is not wonder- 
ful that talent should have appeared among the 
Darwin children, for their mother was a Wedg- 
wood, and here was a combination of superior 
blood quite fulfilling Mr. Galton's ideal. We 
are given an excellent portrait of Mis. Darwin, 
and the following passage from Darwin's auto- 
biography is printed for the first time : 

" You all know your mother, and what a good mother 
she has ever been to all of you. She has been my great- 
est blessing, and I can declare that in my whole life I 
have never heard her utter one word I would rather 
have been unsaid. She has never failed in kindest 
sympathy towards me, and has borne with the ntmost 



patience my frequent complaints of ill-health or dis- 
comfort. I do not believe she has ever missed an oppop- 
tnnity of doing a kind action to any one near her. I 
marvel at my good fortune that she, so infinitely my 
superior in every single moral quality, consented to be 
my wife. She has been my wise adviser and cheerful 
comforter throughout life, which without her would 
have been during a very long period a miserable one 
from ill-health. She has earned the love of every sonl 
near her" (vol. 1, p. 30). 

His old age was cheered by the arrival of a 
grandchild, of whom he writes (letter 754) : 
" We all in this house humbly adore our grand- 
child, and think his little pimple of a nose quite 
beautiful." It must be another grandchild 
whose intelligence is compared with that of a 
monkey. It appears that the monkey 
" was very fond of looking through her [Lady Hob- 
house's] eyeglass at objects, and moved the glass 
nearer and further so as to vary the focus. This struck 
me, as Frank's son, nearly two years old (and we think 
much of his intellect!!) is very fond of looking through 
my pocket lens, and I have quite in vain endeavoured to 
teach him not to put the glass close down on the object, 
but he always wUl do so. Therefore I conclude that a 
child under two years is inferior in intellect to a 
monkey" (letter 417). 

Most of the letters deal with concrete things, 
but here and there we find a bit of philosoph- 
ical suggestion or speculation. The following 
written to Hooker is interesting : 

" I quite agree how humiliating the slow progress of 
man is, but every one has his own pet horror, and this 
slow progress or even personal annihilation sinks in my 
mind into insignificance compared with the idea or 
rather I presume certainty of the sun some day cooling 
and we aill freezing. To think of the progress of mil- 
lions of years, with every continent swarming with good 
and enlightened men, all ending in this, and with prob- 
ably no fresh start until this our planetary system has 
been again converted into red-hot gas. Sic transit 
gloria mundi, with a vengeance " (letter 185). 

However, at the rate at which mammalia ap- 
pear to change, when this happens Homo 
sapiens will presumably have either died out 
or changed into an entirely different genos, 
not to say species ! I suppose this is about as 
certain as the other event, and it is a little hard 
to feel that superior beings may arise who will 
think of us as we regard our long-past mam- 
malian ancestors, — beings so different from 
ourselves that if we could see them we should 
only regard them with fear and hatred. Con- 
siderations such as these constitute a strong 
argument for human immortality in spiritual 
form, not because they afford the least particle 
of proof, but because they arouse in us a feeling 
that immortality is necessary. Darwin seems 
not quite to have felt this, for he writes : "Many 
persons seem to make themselves quite easy 



332

about immortality, and the existence of a per- 
sonal God, by intuition ; and I suppose that 
I must differ from such persons, for I do not 
feel any innate conviction on any such points" 
(letter 571 ; 1874). However, " if we con- 
sider the whole universe, the mind refuses to 
look at it as the outcome of chance — that is, 
without design or purpose " (letter 307 ; 1881). 
There are many more passages one is tempted 
to quote, but the above will suffice to show the 
absorbing interest of the book. Of course there 
is a great deal in the letters that is technical, 
and it is not to be supposed that non-scientific 
persons will read the whole of them. I think 
it is a little to be regretted that so much of the 
quarrel with Professor Owen is allowed to 
appear ; one does not in the least doubt that 
Owen behaved badly, but that is now long 
ago, and probably Darwin himself would have 
been unwilling to bring again to light the fail- 
ings of the old anatomist. The editorial work 
has been admirably done ; the footnotes sup- 
plied by the editors include brief biographical 
notices of the principal persons mentioned in 
the letters. I notice only two trifling editorial 
mistakes; in vol. 1, p. 331, Campodea is said to 
be a beetle, whereas it is a thysanuran ; in vol. 
2, p. 67, the name of the red-underwing moth 
is given incorrectly. The illustrations are quite 
numerous, all portraits ; the photogravures are 
extremely good, especially that representing 
Darwin as a boy, with his sister Catherine. 
There is a very complete index.

French Engravehs of the 
Eighteenth Century.* 



In " French Engravers and Draughtsmen of 
the XVlIIth Century," Lady Dilke brings to 
an end the series in which she has presented 
the leading features of French Art in that 
rather barren period. The eighteenth century 
was not marked by great achievement in the 
graphic arts, except in Japan, where the inven- 
tion and development of chromo-xylography 
led to the production of the marvellously beau- 
tiful color prints, from engraved blocks, which 
are at once the delight and the despair of those 
who seek to rival the attainments in this direc- 
tion by the masters of the Ukiyo-ye school. 
In Europe it was preeminently an epoch of

York : The Maemillan Co. 



transition. The art of its earlier years was a 
survival of the great movements of the pre- 
ceding century, a persistence of ideas whose 
initial force had been spent. Intellectual in- 
spiration declined ; technical skill remained to 
be exercised on more and more unworthy sub- 
jects, until it, too, gradually sank under the 
influences by which the artists of the day were 
surrounded. Toward the end of the century 
there was an awakening, but the movements 
then inaugurated did not culminate until the 
first decades of the succeeding century, to 
which, therefore, they may more properly be 
said to belong. 

In France it was in many ways an age of 
dilletanteism. The master works wrought by 
the great engravers, Edelinck, Nanteuil, and 
Gerard Audran, in the days of the " Grand 
Monarque," and of their successors, Pierre 
Drevet and his even more highly gifted son 
Pierre-Imbert Drevet, awakened such wide- 
spread interest in the art of engraving on cop- 
per that it became a fashionable fad. Cochin 
had for a pupil no less a personage than 
Madame de Pompadour. In the long list of 
amateur engravers of the period we find such 
names as the Princess de Conde ; the Marquis 
d'Argenson ; the Dukes of Chevreuse, of 
Charost, and of Chaulnes ; the Chevalier de 
Valory ; the Marquis d'Harcourt ; the Count 
d'Eu; Bertinazzi dit Carlin, the famous actor; 
and even that of Philippe Egalite himself. 
Some of these left a considerable amount of 
work, but for the most part they shed more 
lustre on the art thi-ough their social prestige 
than by their skill with the burin. Other 
amateurs there were among people of wealth 
and fashion, whose work by its respectable 
quality places them in another and a higher 
class. Among these, the Comte de Caylus 
and Claude-Henri Watelet are the most noted. 
The title of the latter to distinction rests, 
however, quite as much upon his remarkable 
attachment to Madame Le Comte, their life 
together at Le Moulin-Joli, and their famous 
journey to Italy in 1763, as upon the three 
hundred plates that he engraved or etched. 
The tie that bound these people together was 
their common love for art ; Lady Dilke quotes 
from Mme. Viges Lebrun's "Memoirs" the 
following reference to it : "A friend, to whom 
he had been attached for thirty years, lived in 
his house. Time had sanctified, so to say, their 
tie to such a point that they were everywhere re- 
ceived in the best company, as well as the lady's 
husband, who, drolly enough, never left her." 



1903.] 



THE DIAL, 



333 



The place filled by the Comte de Caylus waa 
aniqae. To his contemporaries he was always 
" ce connoissear profond," and he exercised ex- 
traordinary influence over every branch of art, 
and especially over that of engraving, to which 
his devotion was unwearied. With Pierre- 
Jean Mariette, the famous print-seller, collec- 
tor, and publisher, he formed a close friendship, 
and together — to quote Lady Dilke's words — 
they " exercised an authority with which, as 
long as they lived, every dealer, draughtsman 
and engraver had to reckon. . . . Each found 
in the other qualities in which he himself was 
more or less lacking. The varied acquirements 
of de Caylus, his tendency to dogmatic system 
and theoretic speculation, were a stimulus to 
the intelligence of Mariette, who, inheriting 
narrower traditions and special training, was 
inclined toward the exhibition of pure connois- 
seurship, backed, it is true, by an amazing store 
of exact learning. The influence which they 
combined to exercise on their contemporaries 
was of incalculable importance." 

That this influence was stimulating, there can 
be no doubt. At the same time, by its narrow- 
ing tendency it helped to make the sarrounJing 
conditions unfavorable to the awakening of true 
artistic impulse, and thus it became a potent 
factor in a period of decadence. The weakness 
of the position taken by Mariette and de Caylus 
is pertinently stated by Lady Dilke. " It led," 
she says, '• to a doctrinaire assumption of the 
merit of all work — no matter how poor in 
quality — executed according to certain canons 
of taste ; and to the condemnation of all — no 
matter how graceful and brilliant — in which 
these canons were not respected." 

With the death of the younger Drevet, in 
1789, what has been called the golden age of 
portrait-engraving in France came to an end. 
Cochin, Daulle, and other engravers of dis- 
tinction, remained ; but their work does not, 
on the whole, entitle them to be included among 
those of the front rank. And although in the 
latter part of the century there was a great in- 
crease in the number of engravers, a special 
class of whom worked upon illustrations for 
books, there were but few stars of the first mag- 
nitude. Of these, Jean George Wille was the 
most eminent, and attained such extraordinary 
vogue that the subsequent history of line- 
engraving in Europe is little more than an ac- 
count of what was accomplished by him and his 
pupils. 

Lady Dilke has not adopted the historical 
method in the treatment of her subject, bat 



gives, instead, a series of connected essays upon 
the more important men. Her pages are filled 
with pleasant discourse and anecdotes, and a 
good deal of information in given, chiefly 
biographical. There is no attempt at a com- 
prehensive survey of the art of engraving and 
its relation to other branches of the art of the 
period. Such a survey would not only have 
added much to the value of the book, but would 
have made it more readable, and given it the co- 
herence which it now lacks. Of criticism there 
is very little. Such comment upon particular 
works as is given is rather in a vein of indis- 
criminate praise, with which it is not possible 
always to agree. It is difficult, for example, 
to share the author's estimate of Choffard's de- 
signs, or to accept the adjective " miraculously 
pretty " as applied to Cochin's ticket of ad- 
mission to the " Bal Pare, porte et gradins a 
gauche." These, however, are but minor blem- 
ishes in a book which is a conscientious attempt 
to give in entertaining form a view of the 
engravers of the eighteenth century and of the 
conditions under which their work was per- 
formed. 

The illustrations consist of fifty full-page 
reproductions of engravings and drawings.

Thk Xkw Civic Spirit.* 

Two important contributions to the literature 
of the American civic movement — Professor 
Ely on " The Coming City " and Professor 
ZuebHn on " American Municipal Progress " — 
emphasize strongly the newer and richer ideals 
that are becoming prominent. Professor Ely's 
volume does this directly, by way of exhorta- 
tion: Professor Zueblin's, more by means of 
illustration and criticism. Rarely do two books 
so neatly supplement each other. 

The substance of Professor Ely's book is an 
address that has been delivered in various places 
under the title "Neglected Aspects of Muni- 
cipal Reform." The change of title is signi- 
ficant. Five years ago, the central demand was 
distinctly for reforms in administration. The 
" business man " was to be the saviour of the city, 
and a good '• business administration " was the 
highest ideal. The author states clearly his ap-

preciation of the importance of this campaign 
against mal-administration, but shows that the 
" business man" was himself to blame for many 
of these perversions of city government, and 
still more for the narrow range of municipal 
activity. Municipal government is not " busi- 
ness," — it is a profession, and a most exacting 
one. A class of professional office-holders is 
inevitable, and even a necessity. We have, 
then, to determine whether it shall be the cor- 
rupt class that now holds in most of our large 
cities — except during the spasms of reform, — 
or a class of specially trained experts. Pro- 
fessor Ely demands the recognition of the 
university-trained expert as the natural agent 
of municipal government. 

Professor Zueblin's book is a remarkable 
summary and judgment of the attainments and 
prospects of our American cities. " Chapters 
in Municipal Sociology " is the sub-title. Mu- 
nicipal Sociology being defined as the science 
that "investigates the means of satisfying com- 
munal wants through public activity." Trans- 
portation, Public Works, Sanitation, Public 
Recreation, are topics that appear among the 
chapter-headings. One is surprised at the omis- 
sion of Police and Charities, but the author pre- 
fers to leave some topics for political science. 
It is not, however, that something has been 
omitted, but rather that so much has been 
covered, that most impresses the reviewer. 

Upon most of the topics, descriptive studies 
and statistics have been abundant of late. But 
what has been lacking is some balanced judg- 
ment of the relative value of the attainments 
of different cities. Each has been accustomed 
to seize upon some data that appear creditable to 
itself, and to ascribe all criticism purely to envy. 
To consider simply one subject — Parks, — the 
author goes back of the crude statistics of 
area and population to consider the distribu- 
tion of parks, the small park, the playground, 
street area, vacant-lot area, private parks, 
woods near the city, and various other matters 
bearing directly upon the heart of the question. 
And it is not simply the large city, but cities 
great and small, and of every section of the 
country — Savannah and Los Angeles and 
South Bend, as well as Boston and Chicago. 

Professor Zueblin speaks with the authority 
of a more detailed acquaintance with American 
civic conditions than is possessed by almost 
any other man. His judgment is sane, yet at 
times his criticism is so sharp as to make the 
book stimulating as well as instructive. 

Through both of these books runs the spirit 



of the newer civic movement, — something that 
is like a revival of the ancient civic religions : 
the passion to make our cities such that we 
may glory in them as the fullest expressions of 
our highest life. q^krett P. Wyckoff. 



The liiFE AND Letters of Max Mull,er.« 

The various memoirs of Professor Miiller's 
life have by no means made the present intel- 
ligent and tasteful work a repetition, and we 
find here, in gratifying continuity, the whole 
story of this serene career, the only noticeable 
inaccuracy lying in the occasional confusion of 
proper names and foreign phrases. 

Max Miiller was akin in nature to Lowell : 
rich in his endowment of winsome charm, 
" loving his fellow creatures and loved by 
them," as he presents his own ideal to a young 
namesake. He may even be called the Last 
of the Romanticists, inheriting directly the in- 
nermost traditions of Jena and Berlin. His 
achievements in scholarship lay a large claim 
upon the gratitude of the modern world, but 
science alone could never fill his whole heart. 
" Deutsche Liebe " (better known under the 
title of the American version, " Memories ") 
is the most personally typical of his writings, 
and was regarded by him with an especial af- 
fection. No little opposition to Max Miiller 
came from stolid worshippers of fact who had 
never learned that truth is raised to potency 
only when touched by the imagination. " I 
admire those who try to purify the Thames," 
he wrote, " but I have no shoulders for that 
kind of work. My favourites of course are 
the German Mystics, particularly Master 
Eckart and Cardinal Cusanus "; his life-story 
strengthens our conviction that the values of 
life cannot be realized save by those who are 
" Refreshed from kegs not coopered in this our world." 

Miiller's brilliant scholastic training in- 
volved two chief factors, poverty and pluck, 
both in unstinted measure. A rigorous clas- 
sical education in the Leipsic Gymnasium 
sweetened his whole life with the Attic charm. 
At the University of Leipsic (1841-1844) his 
interest was drawn to Sanskrit by Professor 
Brockhaus. Of great value at this time was 
a close intimacy with Theodor Fontane. Max 
Miiller's fine elevation of personal character is

manifest in these younger days, in which a 
chivalrous devotion to his widowed mother 
foreshadowed that high-minded loyalty to all 
natural ties which so dignified his entire life. 
When but nineteen years old he obtained the 
degree of Doctor of Philosophy ; in March, 
1844, he brought out a translation of the 
Hitopadeca, and betook himself to Berlin to 
carry out studies in Sanskrit and philosophy. 
In Berlin he reconciles the straitest private 
surroundings with social prestige in the best 
intellectual circles of the capital. From his 
ill-appointed garret he writes, " I cannot give 
up Sanskrit, though it holds out no prospect 
for me," nor did he, even when the waters rose 
most threateningly. Toward the end of No- 
vember, 1^44, came an invitation from a Baron 
Hagedorn of Dessau (a type of that convenient 
deus ex machina for which European society 
contrives to have room), to stay at his house 
in Paris while working at Sanskrit. To Paris 
he accordingly goes, and, although his deus ex 
macfiina leaves him very much in the lurch, 
he in some unexplained way contrives to keep 
soul and body together while (through Bar- 
nonf's influence) he attacks with supreme en- 
thusiasm his life-work, the preparation of a 
monumental edition of the Rig Veda with 
Sayana's commentary, — a task involving the 
mastery of the whole illustrative literature 
from appalling masses of corrupt Indian man- 
nscripts. " If I had to wait ten years," he 
said (somewhat later), '* I would not translate 
a single line till the whole Vedic antiquity 
with its wealth of thought lay clearly before 
me." In addition to the enormous work in- 
volved, there loomed up the disheartening fact 
that no publisher could be induced to under- 
take the printing. '' Life is difficult, and 
why?" he discourses to his mother: "because 
of that cursed money, which so many throw 
away, which makes thousands miserable, and 
very few happy." The day began to break, 
however, in 1846, when Miiller went to London 
to spend three weeks ; — it turned out a resi- 
dence in England of more than fifty-four years. 
In April, 1847, Miiller wrote to his mother: 
" All tnT time, moner, and work, indeed mr whole life 
perhaps, woald hare been sacrificed and lost, had not 
Bonsen, who bad once been in the same position, with- 
out my saying anything to him, stood by me, and in this 
way made it possible for me to straggle on with joyful 
confidence and firm faith towards the goal I had set 
before me." 

It would be an attractive digression to pay a 
tribute to Baron Bunsen (surely he must be the 
original of that lovable ambassador in Mrs. 



Ward's " Eleanor " !), described by his young 
protege as one who is " always cheerful, and 
studies Egyptian and Chinese to drive politics 
out of his head " ; " the sort of diplomatist they 
all should be, a true man, simple and good, 
desiring and striving for what is right, and 
leaving the rest to providence. For this the 
wise Metternich pronounces him to be no diplo- 
matist." Bunsen was at all times keenly on the 
lookont for handicapped talents, and smooth- 
ing the path before them with equal delicacy 
and generosity. It was he who persuaded the 
reluctant Board of Directors of the East India 
Compaay, all strictly practical men, to under- 
take the editing and publishing of the Rig 
Veda ; Miiller was promised £200 a year on a 
contract which involved about eight years' 
time, and thus his complete financial inde- 
pendence was assured. In 1848 he settled in 
Oxford, from which time his influence extended 
rapidly and steadily. His fineness of mind and 
charact«r made a distinct impression upon the 
best English society, and he had the tact and 
good sense to adjust himself to whatever dif- 
ferences arose, aesthetic or social. " When 
Beethoven's Septette was played as a finale, 
they mostly went away ; perfect barbarians ! 
And yet they are good honest people, with 
whom it is easy to live when one understands 
them." His Oxford lectures in the little known 
field of comparative philology immediately at- 
tracted wide interest. He was made an hon- 
orary Master of Arts, member of Christ Church 
College, and Deputy Professor of Modern Lan- 
guages, bringing a vivacity and breadth into 
his lectures which were without precedent. In 
1859 he married Georgina Grenfell, a niece of 
Charles Kingsley ; her sterling qualities sup- 
plemented most effectively his admirable gifts, 
and this partnership founded one of the hap- 
piest of all English homes, a centre of far- 
reaching influence which drew to itself the 
choicest spirits from near and far. It is 
hardly necessary to detail the further progress 
of labors which were particularly successful in 
gaining the attention of the public for studies 
of which it had never suspected the existence. 
The Rig Veda was completed after more than 
twenty-five years' work, and achieved the high 
ideal of its editor by dispersing the accretions 
with which milleniums of superstition had en- 
crusted it. The later years of life were devot«d 
chiefly to the comparative study of religions, a 
work which was reflect«d in the Parliament of 
Religions in Chicago (1893) — regarded by 
Max Miiller as the most significant event of 



336

the nineteenth century, — and which shows as 
its imposing monument the stately row of 
versions of the " Sacred Books of the East." 
About a year before his death, which occurred 
on October 28, 1900, he contemplated passing 
from the stage, in a spirit fully consistent with 
his true and simple life. 

" What is more natural in life than death ? and hav- 
ing lived this long life, so full of light, having been 
led so kindly by a fatherly hand through all storms and 
struggles, why should I be afraid when I have to make 
the last step? I have finished nearly all my work, 
and what is more, I see that it will be carried on by 
others, by stronger and younger men. I have never 
piped much in the market, I gladly left that to others, 
but I have laid a foundation that will last, and though 
people don't see the blocks buried in a river, it is on 
those unseen blocks the bridges rest." 

Miiller's position in England was somewhat 
invidious, for his residence there fell precisely 
at the time when the person of the Prince Con- 
sort had served to arouse a jealous and un- 
reasonable dread of all German influence. On 
this account there were repeated instances of 
the withholding of public recognition which had 
been freely bestowed upon the eminent scholar 
from all sources outside the British isles. 
Miiller's sweet spirit was not perturbed, and he 
remained a discriminating student and admirer 
of British politics. " Though John Bull does 
make a fool of himself now and then," he 
wrote, " the world would soon go to wrack and 
ruin without him." His statesmanlike grasp 
of world-politics exerted a powerful influence 
in the stormy days of 1870 and 1871 by rea- 
son of very intimate relations with Gladstone, 
as well as through his communications with 
Bismarck; in all these expressions he acted as 
the ardent friend of Germany, at a time when 
the whole weight of British sympathy was 
being forced toward the French side. " The 
whole future of the world seems to me to de- 
pend on the friendship of the three Teutonic 
nations, Germany, England, and America"; 
this sentence shows the temper in which he 
worked incessantly, both in public and private, 
— in much the same spirit as that with which 
Mr. Motley labored to sway the inert English 
opinion toward the National cause during our 
civil war. His last days were ennobled by his 
opposition to the abusive hostility of Germany 
toward England at the time of the Boer con- 
flict. The blind frenzy of Germany at this 
time was especially hard to combat : even the 
distinguished Deutsche Rundschau, his long- 
standing intimate medium of communication 
with his fellow-Germans, dared not print his 



courteous and tactful presentation of the En- 
glish side. 

Gentleness and kindness radiated from him 
by natural laws. There was a childlike sim- 
plicity, joined to a delightfully magisterial air, 
a sweet and refined countenance, and a schol- 
arly manner, which gave a total impression of 
the irresistible attractiveness of culture. His 
priceless gift of humor never failed him, nor 
an indomitable playful fun, " which flowed like 
a purling brook, intertwining itself with con- 
versation," as Canon Farrar records. He was 
a poet, dowered with highest lyric sensibility 
and responsiveness from boyhood, or, to speak 
more correctly, for a generation before he was 
born. Oxford was captivated by his mastery 
of the piano, and John Stainer dedicated to him 
his work on Harmony. Miiller's address led 
Bunsen to believe that he ought to have chosen 
a diplomatic career. The best abused man in 
the British Empire on the part of certain nar- 
row religionists, his unobstrusive faith shone 
like a star throughout his active life, and made 
his declining hours serene. His was that rare 
balance of harmonious qualities which pro- 
duces a rounded humanity, — 

'< I framed his tongue to music, 
I armed his hand with skill, 
I moulded his face to beauty, 
And his heart the throne of will." 

The controversy between Max Miiller and 
Professor Whitney, like Goethe's quarrel with 
Sir Isaac Newton, is a painful subject to those 
who revere the memory of both contestants. 
Miiller, in his aversion to pedantry, purposely 
neglected all unnecessary cumbersome appa- 
ratus of scholarship, — " he sweeps cleanest 
that makes the least dust." His temperament 
had its very noticeable limitations : a free hand 
drawing is doubtless a truer portrait than a 
photograph, but clarity of outline is indispens- 
able in the exact sciences. A sheltered life, 
with merely local and congenial duties, had 
sundry unfortunate tendencies — among them 
a well-bred insularity,* an inability to grasp 
certain unheard-of Titanic manifestations, and 
various harmless smaller vanities, a love of 
approbation and a keen personal satisfaction 
in well-earned gains, — which were a part of his 
unusually sensitive and responsive nature. 
Whitney, on the other hand, was of far more 
rugged Puritan conscience as regards the se- 
vere responsibility of the scholar to facts, and 
to him Miiller's graceful fancies were a debase-

ment of the currency of scholarship, bringing 
confusion upon the " grand ideals of careful- 
ness and the love of truth," — as Calvin Thomas 
briefly defines Science. If the first American 
scholar occasionally tended in the direction of 
formalism, it is certain that Miiller persistently 
clutched at theories of most nebulous tenuity. 
It must, however, be taken into account that 
in many cases the latter cheerfully recognized 
the provisional nature of his apercns. His fail- 
ure to estimate the vigor of Whitney's mind 
is to be deplored, nor is there lacking a hu- 
morously tragic irony in his apprehension lest 
the mind of his colossal adversary might be 
wavering. Sufficient to say that these con- 
trasting temperaments came into direct col- 
lision, although one cannot but believe that, in 
essence, the divergent natures were designed 
to supplement and honor each other. While 
our intellect concedes the victory to Antonio, 
car heart cannot keep from leaning toward 
Tasso. 

Quite another matter is the degrading ac- 
cusation of scholastic dishonesty which has 
been made against Max Miiller, a charge which 
in its essence recalls the sordid reproaches which 
hastened to an embittered end the life of a man 
who was not only a naval hero, but one of the 
most high-minded and distinguished of all 
American public servants. In the case of 
Miiller, as of Admiral Sampson, the matter 
turns upon the question whether an eminent 
authority, who has independently wrought out 
a plan of campaign and has put it into success- 
ful and vigorous operation, may intrust details, 
even very important details, to other competent 
hands without abdicating his position as re- 
sponsible head. In 1852 Dr. Aufrecht, a 
capable scholar, was employed by Miiller to 
relieve him of much preliminary work in the 
further preparation of the text of the Rig Veda 
edition, a kind of work which is as depressing 
as sewing carpets. It was Baron Bunsen who 
counselled and fully endorsed the arrangement 
thus entered into, which was quite as much a 
favor to the assistant as to the principal. In 
the Preface to the fifth volume of the Rig Veda 
Miiller puts the whole case frankly and honor- 
ably ; every trait in his character demands that 
we should accept this statement : 

" There is not one doubtful or di£BcuU passage in the 
whole of this work where I have not myself carefully 
weighed the evidence of the MSS. ; not one where I 
have not myself verified the exact readings of the MSS., 
even in those portions which were copied and collated 
for me by others, except where the originals were out 
of my reach. ... I take this opportunity of stating, 



once for all, that there is no page, no line, no word, no 
letter, no accent, in the whole of the Commentary for 
which I am not personally responsible. Nothing was 
ordered for press that I had not myself carefully 
examined and revised, and though for certain portions 
of my edition, as I stated in the Preface to each volume, 
I was relieved of much preliminary labour, the decision 
in all critical passages, whether for good or evil, always 
rested with me." 

"Life is an art, and more difficult than 
Sanskrit or anything else," wrote Max Miiller, 
almost at the beginning of his successful ca- 
reer ; certainly no man ever ordered his days 
more loyally in this spirit. There is in this 
singularly happy and harmonious record some- 
thing more than the charm which attaches to 
" the scholar, beloved of earth and heaven," — 
it is the promise of a higher and better hu- 
manity. To any gifted nature, isolated by 
force of surroundings from the larger and se- 
rener air to which it rightfully aspires, this 
book will prove a destroyer of prison walla, 
and will bring its reader into most intimate 
converse with choice spirits, making him part 
of a social cosmos perhaps as perfect as any 
yet achieved. The length and fulness of detail 
in the work only make this companionship 
more real and potent, and we should therefore 
be unwilling to abridge these large volumes 
by a single page. j^j^.g ^aft Hatfield. 



A Xew Montaigne.* 



No new edition of the essays of Michel de 
Montaigne, noble, courtier, soldier, civil mag- 
nate, and master of affajrs, can fail to arouse 
interest in cultivated minds ; for the name of 
Montaigne is not a mere literary name for critics 
to juggle with, — it is a power, perhaps a grow- 
ing power, in the active world we live in. Mr, 
Hazlitt's edition, the work of an editor whose 
father's name was for many years associated 
with the study of Montaigne, has an especial 
claim upon the expectation of the reviewer. 
That expectation is not disappointed ; the edi- 
tion is in many respects the best which has yet 
been published in English. The revision of Cot- 
ton's classic version is effected with the greatest 
possible conservatism, and the notes, including 
occasional transcripts from Florio, are always 
illuminating. The life (translated from the

five letters by Montaigne which are extant, con- 
stitute a valuable supplement to the text. 

But, after all due credit is allowed for the 
apparatus of the edition, the main interest of 
the reader must focus upon the text itself. 
The lay reader, if he owes his introduction to 
Montaigne to old Florio, may be grieved to 
learn that his text " is grossly inaccurate and 
illiterate "; or, if Cotton has been his master, 
may be troubled by the occasional disturbance 
(in the interest of accuracy) of rhythms 
which long ago took up their dwelling-place in 
his memory, and now refuse to be dislodged. 
On the whole, however, it is a satisfaction to 
have matters set straight ; and there is no very 
good excuse at this day for one's being satisfied 
to have Montaigne in any sort of translation at 
the expense of the original. There is no deny- 
ing that the present version often — more often, 
perhaps, than that of Florio — misses the grace 
and ease of the French text. Perfect verbal 
accuracy in translating must always entail cer- 
tain sacrifices ; for the whole process of re- 
clothing a thought which has been expressed 
finally must be in the nature of a compromise. 
In this case, the work of the editor — who had 
also to be translator — has been done with 
greater success than might have been expected; 
with only occasional awkwardnesses of manner, 
and with perfect fidelity to the meaning of the 
original. In order to secure a pure text, it was 
necessary for the editor not only to restore 
many passages omitted by Cotton, but to trans- 
fer various interpolations to the foot-notes. 
The task was rendered more embarrassing by 
the large number of emendations made by 
Montaigne in successive editions published 
during his life. 

The brief Preface contains an excellent, 
though very compact, estimate of the character 
and genius of Montaigne. 

" He was, without being aware of it, the leader of a 
new school in letters and morals. His book stood apart 
from all others which were at that date in the world. It 
diverted the ancient currents of thought into new chan- 
nels. It told its readers with unexampled frankness 
what its writer's opinion was about men and things, 
and threw what must have been a strange kind of new 
light on many matters but darkly understood. ... Of 
all egotists, Montaigne, if not the greatest, was the most 
fascinating, because, perhaps, he was the least affected 
and most truthful. What he did and what he had 
professed to do was to dissect his mind, and show us, 
as best he could, how it was made, and what relation 
it bore to external objects. He investigated his mental 
structure as a boy pulls his watch to pieces, to examine 
the mechanism of the works ; and the result, accom- 
panied by illustrations abounding in originality and 
force, he delivered to his fellow-men in a book — one 



almost more replete with quotations from other writers 
than any extant : in matter and thought purely personal 
more exuberantly full." 

Montaigne really belongs, in a sense, with the 
great diarists and letter-writers, rather than 
with the great essayists. He wrote, like Pepys 
or Evelyn or Miss Burney, for his own delight; 
and though he deliberately published his work, 
it was with no real expectation of lasting fame. 
"It is, at any rate," says Mr. Hazlitt, "scarcely 
probable that he foresaw how his renown was 
to become world-wide ; how he was to occupy 
an almost unique position as a man of letters 
and a moralist ; how the Essays would be read, 
in all the principal languages of Europe, by 
millions of intelligent human beings who never 
heard of Perigord or the League, and who are 
in doubt, if they are questioned, whether the 
author lived in the sixteenth or the eighteenth 
century. This is true fame. A man of genius 
belongs to no period and no country. He 
speaks the language of nature, which is always 
everywhere the same." JJ. W. Botnton. 



Some Darker Phases or the American 
Revolution.* 



The recently-published letters of Earl Percy 
contain some very interesting items regarding 
the American Revolution, stated from the view- 
point of a British commander. For example, 
the letter to Governor Gage which describes the 
retreat from Lexington ends with this sentence 
about His Majesty's troops : " Nor were they 
a little exasperated at the cruelty and barbarity 
of the Rebels, who scalped and cut off the ears 
of some of the wounded men who fell into 
their hands." 

Mr. Sydney George Fisher, in his account of 
" The True American Revolution," does not 
portray the New England yeoman brandishing 
a tomahawk or using a scalping-knife on those 
famous days in the spring of 1775, — but just 
as certainly he does not paint a picture of well- 
dressed well-equipped heroes in glittering uni- 
forms of Continental blue and buff. 

" Rough, ungainly, unassorted men, round-shouldered 
and stiff from labor; some of them, perhaps, in the old 
ill-fitting militia uniform of blue turned back with red, 
but most of them in smock-frocks, as they had worked 
in the fields, or with faded red or green coats, old yel- 
low embroidered waistcoats, greasy and dirty; some

with great wigs that had once been white, some in their 
own hair, with every imaginable kind of hat or for 
cap, trailing every variety of old masket and shotg^un; 
without order or discipline, joking with their leaders, 
talking, excited, welcoming to their ranks stadents from 
New Haven and clerks from country stores, they hurried 
from the bleak hills of New Hampshire and the sunny 
valleys of Connecticut, until within four or five days 
they had collected sixteen thousand strong at the little 
village of Cambridgfe, where they remained, half- 
starved, shivering in the cold nights without blankets." 

In such words Mr. Fisher undertakes the dis- 
illusionizing process, — to give the American 
reader a true account of the Bevolntion, to re- 
move the halo from the heads of the men of 
that war, and to show the harsher side of the 
struggle. Professor Sumner, a few years ago, 
discussed some of the features of American 
public life before the Revolution, in four chap- 
ters of his '• Life of Alexander Hamilton." 
Mr. George Washington Greene, much earlier, 
introduced some of the same sort of discussion 
into his essays on the initial war of the United 
States ; and other writers have set forth in their 
plain ugliness facts tending to show that there 
cannot be an overturning of social conditions 
and a violent severing of political connections 
without some grating and grinding. 

Mr. Fisher charges the historians with a 
failure to tell the whole truth, and a failare 
with a definite purpose. His main points are 
that the Revolution was not " a great sponta- 
neous, unanimous uprising, all righteousness, 
perfection, and infallibility, a marvel of snooeas 
at every step, and incapable of failure," as 
many writers make out : that, instead of being 
cruel, tyrannical, and aggressive in its attitude 
toward the revolted colonies, the British gov- 
ernment was extremely lenient and conciliatory 
in its methods, at least up to 1778, — this the- 
ory being the only one under which Howe's 
conduct can be understood ; and that the Loy- 
alists, or Tories, deserve far more consideration 
than they have ordinarily received from Amer- 
ican historians. While he discusses these main 
points, the author brings out a large number 
of smaller considerations, all combining to show ■ 
that the " true American Revolution " has not 
been well understood, and that the period was 
a much more ugly and unlovely one than we 
have usually been taught to believe. The book 
will have value as a corrective, and as a safe- 
guard against the tendency to over-emphasize 
the heroic aspects of our Revolution — a tend- 
ency stimulated just now by the interest in 
patriotic hereditary societies and the increas- 
ing output of historical novels of the Revolu- 
tionary days. 



Mr. Van Tyne's story of " The Loyalists in 
the American Revolution " is a concise study 
of what the author calls " a tragedy but rarely 
paralleled in the history of the world." The 
expulsion of the Moors from Spain or the 
Huguenots from France might be used as an- 
alogies to some extent. The position of the 
Loyalists at the begmning of the struggle, 
their sufferings at the hands of the patriots, 
and their final banishment, are described with 
much detail of statement. The general impres- 
sion gained by the reader is that this element 
of our population was much sinned against. 
At the same time it is clearly shown that there 
was a great deal of striking back, and the con- 
viction is deepened that while many good peo- 
ple, who would have added strength to the new 
republic, were made to snffer very severely and 
were driven into exile, there were also many 
mean people, who were guilty of all sorts of 
detestable acts, and who therefore richly de- 
served all the punishment the patriots oonld 
give them. 

Mr. Van Tyne's volume is a convenient hand- 
book regarding this phase of the Revolution. 
It is enriched with abundant footnotes and 
references to original sources. It has thirty 
pages of supplementary matter containing in 
abstract the principal measures taken by the 
several States against the Loyalists.

•• Minister of Religion " was the 
profession chosen by the yoong sta- 
,jrMgim." ^^^^ WiUiam Ellery Channing. The 

phrase well portrays the mission and inflaenee of 
his life, and forms a fitting sab-title for the Rev. 
John W. Chadwick's new biography (Hooghton). 
Tbe preface to Mr. Chadwick's volume saggests 
a note of comparison, inevitably recurring to the 
reader's mind, between the lives of Channing and 
Theodore Parker and the author's treatment of each, 
— "as different as carving a statue from painting 
a picture, so much warmth and color were there in 
Parker's experience and personality, so little in the 
older and greater man's." From the •' Memoir " of 
1848, the volumes of sermons, and other soarces, 
the biographer has eonstracted a book which is 
never brilliant or dramatic, but is well condensed 
and interesting. Wisely, he purposed to emphasise 
" the social rather than the theological " in tracing 
Channing's inflaenee upon American religions life. 
The paragraphs where his purpose lapsed are less 
sure in grasp and poise than the revelations of his 
subject's mental and moral calibre. The develop-

mentof character is outlined in progressive chapters, 
from the picture of the impulsive and meditative 
child of early Newport days, to the active, often 
ascetic, preacher and social reformer of Boston and 
its historic Federal Street Church. The strong, 
hroad nature of the man are cited alike in the in- 
cidents of theological — or Unitarian — controversy, 
in his messages on anti-slavsry, and in his vital 
efforts for educational and moral reform. The 
closing words of the volume are well-choaen, — the 
reiteration that Channing found " the realization of 
his hopes far less in the spread of those particular 
opinions which received his intellectual assent than 
in the softening of sectarian animosities, the diminu- 
tion of sectarian zeal, the kinder mutual regards of 
different bodies of believers, the enlarging sympathy 
of the world's great religions, and the labors of 
those men who are doing what they can to lessen 
party spirit, to improve social conditions, and to 
uphold, in spite of proud contempt and rancorous 
opposition, the things that make for peace." In 
effective contrast with the intense mental activities 
of Channing is the revelation of his domestic hap- 
piness, his delight in children and friends, and his 
restful pleasurable hours in his " Oakland " garden. 
The directness and force of Mr. Chad wick's style is 
occasionally marred by discursive paragraphs, and 
by the intrusion of favorite but labored quotations; 
as, for example, on page 79, where, following a 
citation from Channing's emphasis of daily duties 
as media for religious service, he writes : '' If 
Channing had been one of the quoters, as he was 
not, and he had had Keble's ' Christian Year ' at 
hand, which was not published till 1827, he would 
certainly have quoted here, — 

'The trivial round, the common task,' " etc. 
A more descriptive method, and less of analysis 
and argument, would have added effectiveness to 
the chapters dealing with Channing's personality, 
in private and public incidents alike. 

" To feast upon the treasures of the 
past is one of the rewards of loneli- 
ness." Thus soliloquizes " A. C. M.," 
as he blows a cloud of smoke from his briar-wood 
pipe and enters upon "The Reflections of a Lonely 
Man " (McClurg). The range of contents of this 
attractive little volume is less wide than one might 
have expected from the writer's declaration that he 
has had " experience of nearly everything that a 
man can read about in books, and of some things 
that a man cannot read about." Mild satire, 
touched with humor, is the prevailing note. But 
the satirist occasionally betrays a forgetfulness of 
the fact that criticism is a two-edged sword, to be 
wielded with caution. College education and col- 
lege professors receive from him the patronizing, 
half-contemptuous treatment that argues not exactly 
the broadest and highest education in the speaker 
himself. The study of foreign languages to perfect 
one's knowledge of English is held up to ridicule, 
and incidentally the writer betrays an imperfect

command of French. The best utterances in the 
book are those on government and politicians. "If 
we should have any time," says the author, illus- 
trating the futility of much that is classed under 
the head of government, " to devote to politicians 
and their laws, we might spend it in weeping at the 
spectacle of a legislature trying, by laws of its own 
enactment, to prevent itself from accepting bribes." 
The following definitions are good : " An agnostic 
is a man who believes nothing that he cannot abso- 
lutely prove ; a practical man is one who believes 
anything that he can prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt ; a hopeful man is one who believes anything 
that he cannot disprove ; and an idealist is one who 
believes what he knows is not true." Christian Sci- 
ence, it is shrewdly observed, " exploits a theory 
whereby not only medicine, but all other material 
things — except money — are entirely eliminated 
from the treatment of disease . . . The Christian 
Scientists are clever as well as cheerful people . . . 
and they have entertained some incurables and 
cured some people who were not sick, quite as well 
as any one else could have done it." In discussing 
" The Search for Satisfaction," the author thinks 
that a man may find what he seeks in woman's love, 
though he holds out little hope of its being a last- 
ing content. " It is well," he says in conclusion, 
" to think one's own thoughts occasionally, even 
though they be wrong " ; and he modestly and 
wisely admits the probability of error in his own 
musings. 

William Paterson is best known to 
history as the spokesman of " the 
New Jersey plan " in the Federal 
Convention, intended to preserve the rights of the 
smaller States against their larger sisters. Addi- 
tional fame rests upon his administration as Gov- 
ernor of New Jersey, and his thirteen years as 
a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. An 
insight into his earlier years is now afforded by the 
publication of " Glimpses of Colonial Society and 
the Life at Princeton College, 1766 1773 " (Lippin- 
cott). These glimpses are given in a series of let- 
ters written by Paterson to his college friends, and 
by random letters written to him. Among these 
friends are John Macpherson, who fell in the assault 
of Quebec ; Luther Martin, of Anti-Federalist fame ; 
and Aaron Burr, who was graduated from Prince- 
ton in the class of 1772. With these letters are 
included some verses, chiefly in the style of Pope, 
intended for the Cliosophic Society of Princeton 
College, and a few scraps of old-time college songs. 
Abounding in classic allusion, passing readily upon 
occasion into Latin, quoting from Swift, Pope, Mo- 
lifere, and Horace, the compositions of this young 
law student, recently graduated from Princeton, 
illustrate the aristocracy of letters in that day. Al- 
though covering the years important in the political 
revolution of the Colonies, there is scarcely a refer- 
ence to politics, or any prophecy of the public ca- 
reer so soon to be opened to this verbose essayist.

Instead of soch slangy matter as woald fill the 
pages of a modern college student, there are alio- 
sions to nymphs, enchanting Peggies, adored Pat- 
ties, and fair Duleineas. The searcher for local 
color, and the student of manners and castoms 
of that pre-Revolationary period, cannot fail to be 
rewarded by a perusal of these effasions. The prac- 
tice of sending law students to England for final 
study is exemplified, and the worry of a tutor over 
the pranks of unruly students at Christmas time 
illustrated. Of these disturbers of early Prince- 
^n days, the worst seems to have been " one of 
oQr suspended bo>s of the name of Hart from 
Kentocky." Several of the letters show a custom, 
evidently quite prevalent at the time, of graduates 
writing commencement essays for their neophyte 
brethren. Paterson seems to have been quite gifted 
in this direction, and quite willing to accommodate 
his friends. Nearly a quarter of a century after 
taking his degree, he was importuned by a Senior 
whose need of literary assistance is evidenced by 
the letter in which he says : '■ I have made a trial 
of my own abilities with a view to my own im- 
provement and avoid being troublesome to others ; 
but I distrust my being any way adequate to a 
suitable preparation and would be scrappy." The 
annotating of the present volume is well done by 
Mr. W. Jay Mills, previously known in connection 
with accounts of certain historic homes of New 
Jersey. 

The opening words in the Introduc- 
tion to Mr. Laurence Button's " Lit- 
erary Landmarks of Oxford " (Scrib- 
ner) are characteristic of the easy and pleasant style 
of the book throughout. They carry with them the 
impression of the author's real pleasure in his under- 
taking and remind us of what Mr. Howells says, 
that " to please one's self honestly and thoroughly 
is the only way to please others in matters of art." 
We can now comfort ourselves with the thought that 
although we cannot, as did Hannah More in 1772, 
" gallant about " Oxford with Dr. Johnson for a 
guide, we can at least participate very vividly in 
the memories of those old days by reading these 
pages of Mr. Hutton's. The information he gives 
is not that of the guide books, nor of the '■ intelligent 
local guide " whose boast it was that be could " do 
the 'alls, collidges, and principal hedifices in a noor 
and a naff '' ; but it is about the things which Mr. 
Button himself wanted to know and could find in 
no one place until he had searched many volumes 
and asked hundreds of questions of " Dons, of 
Graduates and Undergraduates, Scouts and Hall 
porters, of A.ntiqnarie3 and Topographists." It is 
very entertaining to know that Dean Stanley in 
writing to Mrs. Arnold of her distinguished husband 
familiarly called him '-Matt " ; and to be shown the 
staircase at Pembroke where Johnson often came 
"tumbling down," and to know that bis room is 
still practically unaltered, that two of his desks are 
preserved, and his tea-pot is in a cabinet in the Bafr-

sary. We are equally interested to learn that Christ 
Church, with which Royalty and Aristocracy have 
been associated and where such men as Sir Philip 
Sidney and John Raskin and Gladstone have been 
prominent, was famous also for the pranks of its 
students. That Walter Pater •' could almost have 
swung a kitten if it were a small kitten between his 
bed, his window and his door " in his room at 
Brazenose is a bit of information worth having. 
And a description of Shelley's room at University 
College and a pen-sketch of his window seat are 
precious glimpses to the reader. Anecdotes seri- 
ous and humorous are scattered through the book, 
together with odd bits of personal gossip, all of 
which lend a charm to what might have been, in 
other hands than Mr. Button's, a mere category of 
obscure facts. The illustrations in pen and ink, 
done by Mr. Herbert Railton, are a very attractive 
addition to the book. 



A new Lift 
»J MadiwK. 



Mr. Gaillard Hunt's '■ Life of James 
Madison " (Doubleday, Page & Co.) 
is evidently an outgrowth of the au- 
thor's labors as editor of " The Writings of James 
Madison." It is a solid work, written with pains- 
taking care, fortified with references and footnotes, 
and altogether worthy of respect. As compared 
with the smaller life of the same man by Sidney 
Howard Gay, it may be called more valuable as an 
original study, as it gives more fully the facts of 
history that form the setting of Madison's life and 
of which he was himself a most important part. 
But while the student will rate this book higher, 
the ordinary reader will be likely to find it some- 
what dull. This is due in part to a lack of bright- 
ness in the author's style, but it is also due to the 
character of the distinguished subject of the biog- 
raphy. Madison was a student, a statesman, a 
man of the highest worth, but be was not an in- 
teresting person ; he was to outward appearance 
cold, as he was insignificant in size. He did a 
magnificent work for our nation in helping to bring 
about the adoption of the Constitution ; perhaps it 
might not have come into being if it had not been 
for his wisdom, influence, and skill. Be was a lead- 
ing figure in the first Congress, where the prece- 
dents were established that decided whether the 
new government should be a success or a failure ; 
and his influence there was of immeasurable value. 
Be was a successful Secretary of State under Jeffer- 
son, being in hearty sympathy with the democratic 
revolution that had put that great apostle of theo- 
retical democracy into the seat of the more aristo- 
cratic Washington and Adams, though he could 
not maintain the dignity of bis country against the 
attacks of all Europe. But he failed as President 
because of the insurmountable difficulties of his 
position when both England and France were de- 
termined to prey upon us as the only neutral power, 
and to prevent our taking advantage of that posi- 
tion ; he could hardly have been a successful Presi- 
dent in the quietest times, for he did not know how

to manage men, and his selections for his cabinet 
were perhaps the poorest that any President has 
ever made. He was a man of books and of the 
council, not a man of action ; and the Presi-

admiration for him both in his public and in his 

private life.

Professor of Ecclesiastical History 
in St. Mary's College, Oscott, takes up the period 
succeeding the fall of Rome and coming down 
nearly to the modern period, — to be exact, from 
590 to 1303, or from the time of Gregory the Great 
to Boniface VIII. In the introductory chapters the 
author develops the growth of the idea of the Pope 
as the head of Christendom, presiding over tem- 
poral as well as spiritual affairs, and then takes up 
the main occurrences of the long years in which 
Christian Rome was in conflict with Northern tribes. 
Presenting in detail the most noteworthy of these 
events, and indicating by clever summaries the cur- 
rent of the general movements at work, he carries 
the story of the Popes through the Mediaeval period. 
History records no more interesting events and 
episodes, no stories having more of the element of 
picturesqueness, than these of the followers of Chris- 
tianity and the legions of the Roman army carry- 
ing on their work among the barbarians from one 
end of Western Europe to the other, — of Popes 
compelling Emperors to bow to them, of Crusaders 
struggling heroically for possession of the Holy 
Sepulchre. It is "a tragedy and a romance; or, 
as the millions of the faithful believe, a prophecy 
and a fulfilment." The author's point of view is 
not sectarian. He treats his sul)ject broadly, and, 
concerning himself merely with the facts of history, 
in clear and graphic style pictures to us Rome as 
" the mother of civilization, the source to Western 
peoples of religion, law, and order, of learning, art, 
and civic institutions," giving to the multitudes 
which settled down within the boundaries of the 
West " a brain, a conscience, and an imagination, 
which at length transformed them into the Chris- 
tendom that Augustine had foreseen." Two maps 
and fifty-eight illustrations — the latter represent- 
ing old mosaics, coins, frescoes, and paintings, — 
add much to the interest and usefulness of the work. 



The lighti of 
a/lerrioon. 



The title of Mrs. Celia Parker Wool- 
ley's new book, " The Western 
Slope" (William S. Lord), must 
not be misunderstood. The author holds that we 
enter upon the western slope of life at thirty, — 
rather earlier than most of us would be ready to 
admit ; and her book is not a glorification of old 
age. It is rather a view, from over the crest of 
the hill, of " the way we have come." It glimpses 
the last forty years or so of progress in religion, so- 
cial effort, and literature. What Mrs. WooUey has 



to say on these subjects is wisdom, and much of it 
is wit besides. She sees the " eastern slope " in a 
serene but not unbrilliant light, — the light of 
afternoon sunshine; and though her presentment 
id sometimes a little categorical, from crowding too 
much into a limited space, it has in it both spirit 
and truth. She finds that religion has become 
sweeter because deed has replaced dogma, and our 
social endeavors more sane because we realize that 
the needy ones of earth ask " not alms, but a 
friend." Her faith falters a little at the literary 
outlook, because form has become so much to us ; 
she thinks " the art of saying things has about 
reached its zenith, but great things to be said still 
await their spokesman." The strongest note of 
her philosophy is that which denies that the good 
of the whole can be distinct from that of the indi- 
vidual. " The social mechanism is no mechanism 
at all ; it is a great, big, throbbing human heart, 
and every time you or I suffer a new loss, perform 
a mean or careless action, that great heart beats 
with one more throb of pain." The little book 
will awaken thoughtful interest among readers 
who have attained the easy slope of life which she 
defines. 

Horace Oreeiey " The place to Study Horace Greeley 
studied in his is in his newspaper," says Mr. Will- 

newspaper. -^^^ Alexander Linn, whose biog- 

raphy of the great journalist has just been added 
to the " Historic Lives Series " of Messrs. D. Ap- 
pleton & Co. Mr. Linn has adhered steadfastly 
to this belief, departing from it only when taking 
some of the material for the early part of Greeley's 
career from his own " Recollections of a Busy Life." 
The result is a well-written newspaper sketch of the 
founder of " The Tribune," taking up each national 
event during Greeley's editorship and showing his 
attitude toward it, offering quotations from " The 
Tribune " to give each statement due support, but 
lacking sympathy with the personality of the sub- 
ject. In inverse ratio to Parton's life of Greeley, 
which has stood the test of time, one here finds 
Greeley the politician first, Greeley the reformer 
next, and Horace Greeley last of all. Neither writer 
has spared the foibles, the stubbornness, and the 
frequent tendency to be on the wrong side, which 
characterized the well-meaning Greeley ; but the 
recent biography is devoid of the con amove touch 
which Parton possesses. Admirers of Greeley — 
and there must be such, despite his political, social, 
and religious heresies, — will regret that the present 
author, measuring the editor by the newspaper yard- 
stick, can find no motive for the reforms attempted 
by him in Congress other than by advertising " The 
Tribune " and securing some notoriety for himself. 
To the same selfish impulse is largely attributed 
Greeley's acceptance of the Liberal nomination in 
1872, with no credit for the warm-hearted, sym- 
pathetic nature, which saw true Reconstruction of 
the South only in kind treatment and the with- 
drawal of force. To establish his point, the author

cites the increased receipts of "The Tribune" 
counting-room after Greeley's one term at Wash- 
ington. The volume will be used by those desiring 
a clear summary of Greeley's attitude toward cur- 
rent events, as well as of important occurrences in 
his early life ; but it is not likely to be read purely 
from interest in the story aa here told. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"Twenty Original Piano Compositions by Franz 
Liszt," edited by Mr. August Spanutb, and " Fifty 
Songs by Robert Franz," edited by Mr. William Foster 
Aptborp, are the latest additions to the "Musician's 
Library" published by Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co. 
When the opening volumes of this library appeared 
last winter, we took occasion to commend the enter- 
prise in the warmest terms, and we need only add upon 
the present occasion that the editors of the new vol- 
umes have done their work with marked intelligence, 
and with a clear recognition of the educational nature 
of this undertaking. The Liszt numbers are selected 
entirely from the original works, mostly dating from 
the composer's early period. The Franz songs, on the 
other band, range through the whole term of the writer's 
creative activity. 

Perhaps the most important feature of the "Vir- 
ginia" edition of Poe was the new life of the poet 
prepared by the editor, Professor James A. Harrison, 
together with the volume of Poe's letters, then first 
collected for such a purpose. The Messrs. Crowell, who 
publish the edition, have been well-advised to make a 
special separate edition of these two volumes of the 
" Life and Letters of Edgar .\llan Poe," thus securing 
a large constituency who, already possessed of a good 
text, are yet desirous of adding to their libraries the 
biographical part of the " Virginia " Poe, but hardly 
feel justified in purchasing the entire set of seventeen 
volumes. This library edition of the two volumes is 
extra-illustrated with portraits and facsimiles, and 
makes a most presentable appearance. 

During the past half-dozen years the newspaper car- 
toons of Mr. John T. McCutcheon have proved a source 
of daily recurring delight to thousands of Chicagoans. 
That this pleasure may be shared beyond the local coo- 
fines, Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. have selected an 
even himdred of the best of Mr. McCutcheon's draw- 
ings and published them in a handsome quarto volume, 
fittingly prefaced by Mr. George Ade. With the tra- 
ditional school of political cartoonists, who make of their 
medium a grim weapon of ridicule and abuse, Mr. Mo- 
Cntcheon has nothing to do. In his hands the cartoon 
is a genial contribution to the cause of gaiety and good 
humor. He prefers to deal with subjects of broad, 
every-day, human interest, giving to politics no more 
than its due proportionate place in the sum of affairs. 
A keen intelligence and a frolicsome humor are every- 
where evident in his work; his fun is always wholesome, 
and his satire none the less effective because good- 
natured. A word of particular praise should be given 
the artist's *• boy " series; since " Tom Sawyer " and the 
" Bad Boy " of Mr. Aldrich we have had no truer rep- 
resentation of typical boy life. This entertaining vol- 
ume will go far toward establishing Mr. McCutcheon's 
title to a foremost place among American cartoonists.

"Greek Composition for Schools," by Professor 
Robert J. Bennes, is a new publication of Messrs. 
Scott, Foresman & Co. 

"The English Language," by Messrs. Frederick Manly 
and W. X. Hailmann, is an elementary text-book pub- 
lished by Messrs. C. C. Birchard & Co. 

" Cymbeline," edited by Professor Edward Dowden, 
has just been added to the library edition of Shakes- 
peare in course of publication by the Bowen-Merrill Co. 

The third book of Plato's " Republic," in the trans-

in pamphlet form by Messrs. Charles H. Kerr & Co. 

"The Role of Diffusion and Osmotic Pressure in 
Plants," by Mr. Burton Edward Livingston, is an 
octavo volume in the University of Chicago Decennial 
Publications. 

" Historical Readings Illustrative of American Pat- 
riotism," by Mr. Edward S. Ellis, is a new school 
reading-book for children published by Messrs. Silver, 
Burdett & Co. 

" Heroes of the Norselaods," by Miss Katharine F. 
Boult, is a new volume in the " Temple Classics for 
Young People " published by the Macmillan Co. in 
connection with Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., of London. 

"The Yellowplush Papers," "Diary of C. J. de la 
Pluche, Esq.," "The Fitz-Boodle Papers," and "A 
Legend of the Rhine," make up the contents of the 
latest volume in the Dent-Macmillan edition of Thack- 
eray. 

" A SoTvey of English Ethics," published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co., is a reprint of the first chap- 
ter of Mr. Lecky's " History of European Morals," 
edited for the use of college students of ethics by Mr. 
W. A. Hirst. 

Professor James M. Hoppin's "Great Epochs in Art 
History " has been published in a second edition by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifilin & Co. The work has beeu 
carefully revised and corrected, and has been given a 
new preface. 

In its enlarged form " The Craftsman " oontinnes to 
gain steadily in value and interest. With the issue for 
June two new departments will be added and commence- 
ment made of an extended illustrated series of papers 
upon American Ceramics. 

A welcome volume in the " Temple Classics " series 
(Dent-Macmillan) is a reprint of Goldsmith's " The 
Bee " and miscellaneous essays, edited by Mr. Austin 
Dobson. Miss Bumey's " Evelina," in two Tolmnes, 
has also been added to the same series. 

" The Story of the Philippines," by Miss Adeline 
Knapp, is a reading-book for schools published by 
Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. in their "World and Its 
People " series. We cannot commend the disingenuous 
chapter which describes the way in which the archi- 
pelago became an American possession, but the work 
is otherwise deserving of a certain measure of praise. 

The fashion of turning novels into plays has led in 
turn to the fashion of " players' editions " of the nov- 
els converted, which means as a rule that these editions 
are illustrated by a few photographs of stage scenes 
and the portrait of some popular actor. Count Tolstoy's 
"Resurrection" (Dodd), in Mrs. Maude's translation, 
is the latest work of fiction to be given this form of 
publicatiou, and the last that we should have expected

to see in sucb guise. Bat then, it is also the last that 
we should have expected would fall into the vandal 
hands of the playwright. 

The third yearly volume of " LaChronique de France," 
covering the year 1902, together with its supplementary 
" Carnet Bibliographique," have just been received from 
the Baron de Coubertin, who seems to be both editor 
and publisher of these useful little annuals. 

Mr. Ripley Hitchcock, for many years literary ad- 
viser to one of the oldest New York publishing houses, 
and the author of several books and numerous maga- 
zine contributions, has become associated with the firm 
of Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Company in the capacity of 
vice-president. 

In connection with the Emerson Centenary, Mr. Rob- 
ert Grier Cooke of New York will publish a revised 
and enlarged edition of Mr. John Albee's " Remem- 
brances of Emerson," which Dr. Edward W. Emerson 
has spoken of as " one of the best of the works that 
have been published about my father." 

The first book issued by the new firm of publishers, 
Messrs. Fox, Duffield & Co., is a tasteful reprint of the 
morality " Everyman," which has been so impressively 
performed in several cities of this country during the 
season just past. The text is the version prepared by 
Mr. Hazlitt in 1874, from a collation of the earlier 
editions, and the illustrations are reproductions of 
quaint old wood-cuts. 

Professor J. Brough of the University of Wales has 
issued a small volume upon " The Study of Mental Sci- 
ence" (Longmans) which consists of a series of popu- 
lar lectures upon the bearings and import of logic and 
psychology. The book is well suited to stimulate an 
interest in these factors of a liberal education, and 
especially among those who have to do with the train- 
ing of young minds. 

A literary rarity of unique interest is now on exhibi- 
tion in the office of Martinus Nijhoff, of 114 Fifth Ave., 
New York. This is an early edition of the " Ars Poet- 
ica " of Horace which at one time belonged to no less a 
personage than the Italian poet, Torquato Tasso, whose 
autographs it bears. The authenticity of the volume 
and its ownership is duly attested on one of the fly-leaves 
by the Custodian of the Biblioteca Vaticana. 

Before the end of this month the Macmillan Co. will 
issue in this country Vols. I. and III. of the "Illus- 
trated History of English Literature " upon which Dr. 
Richard Garnett and Mr. Edmund Gosse have been at 
work for many years. The work will be complete in 
four substantial volumes, the second and fourth of 
which will appear in October. The London publisher, 
Mr. Heinemann, will issue all four of the volumes to- 
gether in the Fall. 

To their previous editions of several of Robert Louis 
Stevenson's works, Messrs. H. B. Turner & Co. of Bos- 
ton have added a reprint of " Memories and Portraits." 
The typography and general make-up of this little vol- 
ume are unusually pleasing, but the special interest of 
the edition lies in a number of well-chosen illustra- 
tions, which include three portraits of Stevenson in his 
younger days, pictures of his father and mother, and 
photographic views of places mentioned in the book. 

New editions of Charles Dickens's novels follow fast 
upon one another. The latest is known as the 
" Fireside " edition, and is published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde in connection with Messrs. Chapman & Hall of 
London. Each novel is complete in a single volume. 



well printed and bound, and containing all the original 
illustrations. The English price for the complete set 
of twenty-two volumes is something less than forty 
shillings. " Pickwick Papers," " Sketches by Boz," and 
" Oliver Twist " are the first volumes to appear, and the 
others will follow at the rate of one a month. This 
should easily take first place among the cheaper edi- 
tions of Dickens. 

A memorial service for the late Alice Freeman 
Palmer was held at Harvard University on the last 
day of January, and many of her friends and educa- 
tional associates gathered to pay their tribute to her 
memory. The programme of this meeting, and the 
words spoken, together with five photographs, are all 
reproduced in a volume of striking typographical ex- 
cellence, published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
The contents include addresses by Presidents Eliot, 
Angell, Tucker, and Hazard. The Association of Col- 
legiate Alumuffi also have prepared a memorial publi- 
cation, with portrait, giving an account of the meeting 
held in Boston last December, for the purpose of plan- 
ning some educational endowment in the name of Mrs. 
Palmer.

Cornet Strong 

OF IRETON'S HORSE 

By DORA GRENIVELL McCHESNEY 

an episode of the ironsides 

Illustrated ky Maurice Greiefenhagen 

This is a powerful " Episode of the Ironsides," opening with an early New England scene, and 

transporting the reader thence to Old England through the troublous times of the Royalist and 

Commonwealth struggles of the XVIIth century. The love story is of the freshest ; the mystery 

of the plot is tantalizing up to the last page. 

Decorative Cover, i2mo, ^i.$o. 



CORNET STRONG 

Some Weighty Appreciations of Miss McChesney's New Novel 

The Chicago Evening Post : " From bloody rencontres with painted savages in the wilds of New England to 

the struggle of Royalists and Puritans ; from mere fighting for existence to the fiercer battling for a cause ; from 

doubt to faith ; from bitter hatred to enthralling love, — these are some of the adroit transitions conceived in her 

really excellent romance." 

The New York Tribune : " Rapidly sketching adventures in the field, in the camp, and in captivity, — all well 

marked by the atmosphere of mingled austerity and reckless gallantry, which we associate with the conflicts of 

Roundhead and Cavalier — she is skillful and inspiriting." 

The Philadelphia Public Ledger : "It seems not too high praise to say of this remarkable story that it is in 

all respects one of the very best of the many romances that have found their setting in the period of the great 

English rebellion. Will stir the blood of the most hardened novel reader." 

The Boston Journal: "She has accomplished her work excellently and has made Cromwell and Ireton and 

Fairfax living figui'es."

" It is a romance of enthralling inter-

''Readers of ' The Thrall of Leif

CARTOONS BY 
McCUTCHEON 



" This book is a delight. It contains 
those inimitable pictures of country boy 
life which are as classic, in their way, 
as Riley's poems celebrating the same 
boy. Not many books of cartoons would 
be worth having, for most cartoonists 
devote themselves to subjects of momen- 
tary interest. . . . But Mr. McCut- 
cbeon's book is such a well-spring of 
pleasure that one cannot think of a 
household that would not be the richer 
for its presence." —The Interior. 



"./# keen intelligence and a frolic- 
some humor are everywhere evident in 
his work ; his fun is always wholesome 
and his satire none the less effective be- 
cause good natured. A word of par- 
ticular praise should be given the artistes 
' boy ' series ; since ' Tom Sawyer ' and 
the 'Bad Boy' of Mr. Aldrich we 
have had no truer representation of 
typical boy life. This entertaining vol- 
ume will go far toward establishing 
Mr. McCutcheon's title to a foremost 
place among living American Car- 
toonists.'" — The Dial.

QUESTIONABLE SHAPES 

By WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS 

Author of " The Kentons,"^ " A Hazard oj Nenv Fortunes,'^ etc. 
In this new book Mr. Howells once more gives evidence of his infinite charm as a story writer 
and enters again into the field of some of his earlier woric — the ever-attractive region of 
psychical phenomena. The book is one of a most unusual character — interesting in its 
mystery and peculiarly affecting in its spiritual side.

The Black Lion Inn 

By ALFRED HENRY LEWIS, Author of the '■'■ mifville" Stories. 
Mr. Lewis is the legitimate successor of Bret Harte. His stories of life in the West are 
classics. In his new book the cowpunchers, miners, half-breeds, and adventurers meet at the 
Black Lion Inn and tell their stories. The tales are all full of life, vigor, and the racy American 
humor which has already made the author's work so popular. 

Sixteen Striking Draivings by Frederic Remington. Post 8vo, Ornamented Cloth, $1.50. 

Sinful Peck 

By MORGAN ROBERTSON, Juthor of " Spun Yarn." 
A very funny story of an unintentional sailing voyage to Singapore. " Sinful Peck " gave a 
dinner-party to a number of old friends — respectable bankers, authors, etc., — and, in order 
to win a bet, made them intoxicated and got them shanghaied on a sailing-ship bound for 
Singapore. The joke at times bade fair to become a very serious matter ; but all ended well. 
The story is crowded with lively incidents on board ship, is true to life, and full of humor.

NATURE AND BOOKS. 



" What books shall I read on my gammer 
onting ? " is a question often asked of one who 
is something of a naturalist and a reader of 
books ; and the question covertly implies that 
one must confine his recommendations to those 
books that treat more or less directly of Na- 
ture. Now if a summer outing means a sum- 
mer resort, where society must still supplant 
solitude, and where there are, therefore, many 
hours to be beguiled, and long times of waiting 
on the piazza for the sun to shine after rain and 
make the excursion possible, then the question 
of reading is a difficult one. The list of good 
Nature-books is large, and from the list one 
must choose those that best correspond to the 
disposition of his questioner, whether it lead 
him to ferns or flowers, to birds or beasts, or 
deeper to the hidden meaning of things visible 
but not half understood. If, however, a sum- 
mer outing means a life in the open fields and 
woods and waters, where a white tent nestles 
among the trees and the heart of the forest is 
telling you all its songs, where you know that 
just around the point the deer and her fawns are 
feeding, and the waves and ripples are calling 
to yon all day long their Indian names, tikoo- 
wuk, tikoorcuk, tikooiceesuk^ tikoowuk! like a 
repeated invitation to come oat in yoar canoe 
and dance with them, — then the answer is 
perfectly simple. There is but one book to 
read on such an outing, and that is the open 
book of Nature herself : for nothing that man 
has written can stand her competition for half 
an hour without becoming dull and dreary by 
comparison. 

This is not the rash expression of a moment, 
but the sober and rather sorrowful experience 
of twenty years in which I took my favorite 
books to the woods, season after season, and 
brought them back invariably wondering what 
was the matter with them. 

Ruskin is good reading, and should keep his 
charm out of doors if anybody can, for he 
touches Nature most masterfully at times; bat 
presently, as you read, like a long-dreaded 
shower on an excursion comes one of his in- 
evitable and irrepressible scoldings. Yoa take 
it meekly enough, though you hoped to escape 
that kind of thing when you went off on your 



358 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



vacation, chastening the spirit of the inner man 
to receive the discipline, while the outer man 
grins in his beard like a Philistine, knowing 
he deserves his scolding yet thinking gleefully 
how the archangels and seraphim will catch it 
about the heavenly music and architecture when 
their turn comes. In the midst of it all, down 
comes a red squirrel to add his little stone to 
those that are being pelted at you. He sets up 
a terrible scolding of his own, barking, snick- 
ering, reviling you for not seeing things as he 
sees them, which is just what your author is 
doing ; and, a thousand to one, you drop Rus- 
kin to watch the squirrel, who, in the woods at 
least, does the thing more artistically and with 
more complete abandon. When he has done 
with his scolding he takes you ofif to see some 
trinket that he has hidden under a mossy log, 
and in spite of yourself your half-primitive mind 
finds the little comedy more interesting than 
all the seven lamps of architecture. 

Emerson is also good reading, and has many 
noble words and some exquisite poems about 
Nature ; but Emerson goes through the fields 
hunting for a thought, and finding it at last in 
his own head. For Nature never puts a thought 
on the surface of things, and one hates in the 
summer-time to have to cudgel his brains or 
to dig in the earth for it like Jeremiah. When 
he goes through the woods, Emerson is like a 
water-color artist with his eyes at squint trying 
to determine the precise tone of things ; and 
you, being a common mortal, prefer to keep 
your eyes wide open, like a boy at a show, and 
see everything that is going on. When he 
stops and meditates for hours, taking no 
account of time like a Hindoo philosopher, 
you must watch a frog on a log apparently do- 
ing the same thing ; and if you must think 
hard — which is a woeful mistake on a sum- 
mer outing, for you miss all that Nature is say- 
ing and doing, and a preoccupied man might as 
well camp on a roof-garden as on Olympus, — 
then it is vastly better to think for yourself once 
in awhile than to letevenEmersonthinkforyou. 

When you try the poets, you are no better 
off. Bryant, who aimed to be the poet of Na- 
ture, becomes mere jingle, with a suggestion of 
rag-time in it, beside the soft and perfect har- 
monies of earth and air and water. Shelley's 
skylark comes down as if hit with a stone when 
a hermit thrush rings the first soft bells of his 
gloria in excelsis; and Wordsworth's too pointed 
morals seem strangely out of place, like a ser- 
mon at a concert, when you are face to face 
with Nature, who receives you absolutely with- 



out suspicion, as if you were one with the rest 
of her children who do no wrong, and who ut- 
ters no complaint or reproach, but is more si- 
lent than usual, even when you violate her con- 
fidence and kill her little children and drown 
the delicate fragrance of her twin-flowers with 
the smell of your villainous powder. 

This was my own first hard lesson in the 
matter of books out of doors. The second was 
sharper, and left fewer regrets. I left behind 
these great spirits of literature, and took with 
me a dozen of the modern Nature-writers for 
rainy days. One of these writers weighed and 
measured everything ; told you the exact num- 
ber of birds in a flock, and the precise diameter 
of the dewdrops on successive mornings ; and he 
only served to convince me how utterly dreary 
the common things of Nature may be if the 
illumination of a man's own spirit be not shed 
upon them. Another, of many volumes and 
many mistakes, saw only the bare surface of 
things, the fur and feathers that clothed the 
Wood Folk, but nothing of the spirit that ani- 
mated them. As you followed him you shud- 
dered when he set fire to the silver fringes of a 
birch-tree and left a blackened and unsightly 
ruin where a thing of marvellous beauty had 
been. He set his dog on every peaceable wood- 
chuck, and sent his boy to kill all the chip- 
munks and sparrows in the neighborhood, at 
a time when they had their young to care for, 
to supply the appetite of a ravenous hawk he 
kept as a pet, — all this, and much more of the 
same kind, written soberly for our edification, 
without a suspicion apparently that he is violat- 
ing all our best feelings, and that these things 
are as woefully out of place in the quiet woods 
as the party of men that you stumble upon, on 
a Sunday afternoon, whose chief reason for be- 
ing out of doors seems to be the beer-keg that 
is set up in the place of honor in the midst of 
them. Such a spirit can never understand 
what it sees, however keen the eyes ; for only 
love, a sincere love without dissimulation, can 
interpret the shy life that, like a little child or 
the going forth of the morning, has no speech 
nor language that our dull ears can comprehend. 

Another writer, of a cheerful, beautiful spirit, 
some of whose books I had found delightful 
reading at home, took you with him on his 
pleasant rambles through the brush and over 
the southern mountains, talking cheerfully all 
the way of all sorts of things, opinions, ideas, 
theories, — but that is just what you don't 
want in the woods. Nature has no opinions or 
theories ; and she cares nothing for yours.

Her life is perfect and complete, — a joyous, 
faithful, optimistic thing, — and you can share 
it as it is, leaving your society ideas, your 
doubts and pessimistic questionings, behind ; 
or she has nothing whatever to give you. So 
I found these pleasant books very much like a 
company of charming ladies that, after many 
importunities, I took vrith me on an early 
morning ramble, " to see and hear and learn 
about the birds," they said. And they chattered 
so charmingly all together that Nature was quite 
forgotten, and the only external things we 
heard were a crow and a flock of blackbirds. 

That was the second unexpected lesson ; but 
the worst was yet to come ; and I must hang 
my head as I tell about it, like a dog that finds 
himself barking at his own shadow by mistake. 

One summer as I started for the woods with 
a little company of friends, contrary to my usual 
custom of going alone, one of my own books 
was published, and the first copy reached me 
scarcely an hour before my train left. I took 
it along gladly, thinking that now I had found 
at least one good book for rainy days. That 
was for my friends, of course. Knowing the 
contents, I could hardly be expected to read it 
much myself, and, remembering my own past 
experience, I said with the vineyard owner 
when he played his last card, — surely they 
will reverence my book. For a month or more 
I tried every dodge and crafty subterfuge that 
was possible to a modest man, to get my friends 
to read the thing. It had some interesting 
observations about animals and birds in it, and 
the drawings were beautiful. I would leave it 
open carelessly on the camp table, with a strik- 
ing picture uppermost, whenever I went away 
salmon fishing or to watch the deer playing ; 
but invariably on my return it was lying just 
as I left it. When my friends asked me ques- 
tions about birds or animals they had seen in 
the woods, I would answer vaguely, and say 
that I thought there was a book in camp which 
would tell them all about it. And then I would 
hunt for it, where I knew it was not, and put 
it hopefully in their hands at last, thinking 
there was now no way of escape. But in a moment 
or two back they would come with the wretched 
book under an arm, as if they were going to 
read it, and ask to be taken out in my canoe, 
or over the blazed trail to the beaver pond : and 
in the charm of the thing itself we forgot all 
about the poor picture of it that we were so 
shamefully neglecting. 

I gave up Nature-books in the woods after 
that, and settled down to the four old com- 



panions, — the Faust, the thumbed Shakes- 
peare, a copy of Martineau's essays, and the 
King James Bible, that are my usual travelling 
associates. But I must confess frankly that 
often weeks go by in the woods without seeing 
one of these old friends opened. The truth is, 
that to read any book in the presence of Nature 
is simply to neglect the greater inspiration that 
made the best books possible. It is like try- 
ing to read a volume of poems in the presence 
of a lovely woman, who is infinitely more in- 
teresting herself than any of the poems she has 
inspired. 

So I go back to my thesis, which was prob- 
ably also in Emerson's mind when he wrote : 

" See thon bring not to field or stone 
The fancies foand in books; 
Leave author's eyes, and fetch yonr own, 
To brave the landscape's looks," 

and say dogmatically that the only book to 
read out of doors is the book of Nature herself. 
Spite of all the books that have been written 
about her, we have hardly as yet learned her 
alphabet. She is like an immense library of 
clay tablets, with their unknown stories of life 
and death and human endeavor, and, like a 
child that loves stories, we are still puzzling out 
the letters that shall unlock the treasures. The 
first five minutes out of doors brings you to a 
story whose final chapter, if you ever read it, 
will be the result of a life's long lesson, — and 
what do you want more for all your idle hours 
than a life's lesson to occupy them cheerfully ? 
The ferns that wave by the roadside where the 
shade is deepest ; the moss that clothes the old 
rocks of the wood ; the bird that sings you up 
in the morning, and that sang last in the un- 
peopled solitudes of Patagonia ; the squirrel 
that runs away when you spread him food and 
comes back presently with a companion to share 
it, and so reveals a language whose first whisper 
you have never heard and whose method no 
naturalist has ever told you about, — in all 
these things there are books to be read more 
interesting than you may have brought with 
you, or happily left behind on your shelves. 
The facts you see are but the letters given you 
to read the story that lies behind. There is 
romance here too, the subtle, romantic play of 
mind whenever you remember or go back to the 
old garret where your childhood's rainy days 
were spent among trunks of old costumes, and 
claw-footed andirons with griffin beads, and a 
Revolutionary cocked hat and a brace of horse 
pistols, and pennyroyal and thoroughwort 
swinging in fragrant bundles from the dusty

rafters. Here in the woods was where your 
childhood — the childhood of your race — was 
spent, some uncounted-odd thousands of years 
ago when your forebears were struggling up 
through animal individuality to attain their 
manhood ; and everything you find here has some 
suggestion and shadowy memory about it that 
can never be expressed, yet never wholly missed 
if the mind be open and receptive. The timid 
mother bird that shows first a diplomat's cun- 
ning, and then more than a lion's courage, in 
shielding her young from your eyes and hands ; 
the cautious track of a coon, the little brother 
to the bear, beside the brook where he washed 
his dinner to give it the taste of fish before 
eating it ; the cave, into which you must crawl 
by some inner compulsion ; the stone arrow- 
head and the wolf's bones that you find there ; 
the great skull of a moose, with a ground- 
bird's nest in the empty eye-orbit, while the 
woodmice raise their children within its lofty 
white dome, — I can understand perfectly why 
my friends prefer to go with me, and find these 
things and let their minds play with them freely, 
than to read about Nature in books. And, as 
the woods are but the garret of our childhood, 
I understand too that only a child's glad spirit 
will ever half comprehend the joy and inspir- 
ation to be found there. For that is perhaps 
the best thing that can be said about the woods 
and waters when you let your eyes see and your 
own heart speak : it makes you a child once 
more; brings back something of the child's 
faith, and his cheery, hopeful outlook on the 
world. And that is what every man seeks, or 
longs for unconsciously, in all his worry and 
work, and that hovers about him like a dream 
at dawn when he hies him away to the woods 
of happy memories : to forget his care and 
weariness and doubt, and be a child in his 
father's house again, ^jlliam J. Long. 



Dk, Selim Hobart Pkabody, an old and very valu- 
able contributor to The Dia.l, died at St. Louis on the 
twenty-sixth of May, at the age of seventy-three. Dr. 
Peabody was a man of great learning, and an educator 
by profession. Born in Burlington, Vermont, he was 
a graduate of the State University, and his career as a 
teacher included experience in his native State, Penn- 
sylvania, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Illinois. He 
was for a number of years a teacher in the high schools 
of Chicago, and afterwards President of the University 
of Illinois. For the last ten years of his life his serv-

Gardens and Garden- Blooms.* 



" Of the three hundred cyclamen plants that we set 
out ourselves on the edge of the grove, not one has 
shown either blossom or even green leaf — they are 
vanished forever. The hedge of yellow roses is all 
dead. And the anemones are all autumn bloomers — 
Japan anemones. The gardener says there are no gar- 
den anemones that blossom in the spring ! I have done 
exactly as that English book said and not one thing is 
right." 

This is a paragraph from a veritable letter 
lately received from an American friend who 
has a new American garden which was to be 
wholly a Spring garden. And she would not 
permit the local nurseryman and florist to plant 
it and " make it like everyone else's " ; nor would 
she ask advice of her neighbors for similar rea- 
sons. But carried into extravagance both of 
money and hopes by the charm of Miss Jekyll's 
delightful "Wood and Garden" and "Home 
and Garden," and her rose and her lily books, 
she followed the Englishwoman's rules and ex- 
periences, and even her suggestions and hopes, 

— and this is the first "flowery May time" of 
her first garden. Bulbs, seeds, plants, shrubs, 

— not one-tenth of those planted are living. 
She has learned in dismay that an English win- 
ter is not a New English winter ; that English 
soil is not American clay and dirt ; that many 
English plants will neither flourish nor live in 
American borders ; and that one cannot go to 
English books for practical instruction and help 
in making American gardens. Like the good 
cook, we must have judgment, else the attract- 
ive volumes are almost valueless as teachers. 

But at last we have a book on gardens which 
will not teach us Americans to plant hedges 
of delicate roses, or banks of cyclamen. Now 
we have given us " A Woman's Hardy Gar- 
den " by Mrs. Helena Rutherford Ely, — an 
American book, by an American woman, about 
an American garden. Let us sigh with grati- 
tude and read the volume with delight. For 
here it all is, — what we should plant and when 
we should plant it ; how to care for it after it 
is planted and growing; what to do if it does 
not grow and blossom ; what will blossom, and

when it will blossom, and what the blossom will 
be. We learn of annuals and perennials, and 
bedding out : we are given good sensible lists, 
with a few descriptions of rare plants, and of i 
gfarden shrubs : we are told what we can do 
with them all, what we must not do, and what 
we cannot do : we learn the prices of plants and 
seeds, the cost of garden-making ; we learn of 
garden resources, and of makeshifts. 

But the book is not devoted wholly to the 
practical : it is full of garden-love, of the spirit 
of happy outdoor life. It is a good book, a 
wholesome book ; it influences you in the read- 
ing, just as working in the garden does in the 
doing, — not walking in the garden merely, 
but turning over the soil, pulling the weeds, 
nursing up a drooping plant, getting close to 
the ground ; you feel bett«r and truer, — feel 
that life is good and is worth living, while there 
are gardens, and flowers blooming in these 
gardens, and women who are living and loving 
both flowers and gardens, and writing about 
them. The author tells of her Grarden Diary — 
a scrap-book of printed slips and an entry-book 
for written notes, — a journal which should be 
kept bv everyone who owns a garden : for such 
records afford a wonderful bond of union and 
of friendly controversy with other garden- 
owners, as well as a never-ceasing delight to 
the diary-keeper. And in this case the Garden 
Diary has a special signiflcanee, for it is like 
a promise of a second and even more detailed 
book on Mrs. Ely's Hardy Garden. 

A good book for Englishmen to use, and 
Americans to read, has been added to Mr. 
John Lanes excellent series of books on En- 
glish gardening. This is devoted to "The 
Wild Garden." and like the others of the series 
is suggestive rather than definite for consulta- 
tion by American garden-owners. For not 
only garden-plants but English wild-flowers 
that grow readily and blossom happily in En- 
glish glades and meads and copses and spin- 
neys, refuse to live in our plain woods and 
pastures. And the author surprises us by his 
report of the behavior of some of our Ameri- 
can plants in English " wild gardens " ; we 
hardly recognize them. He describes the 
Trailing Arbutus (^Epigrfa repens), or collo- 
quially our Mayflower, as a hardy shrub with 
flesh-colored flowers, that grows and spreads 
readily wherever planted. It is difficult to 
think of the Mayflower as a shrub, nor will I 
call its perfection of pinkne^s flesh-color : and 
I cannot believe that it grows and spreads 



rapidly. I bethink me of the whims, the freak- 
ishness, the shyness, the impossibility, of the 
demure New England Mayflower that I have 
always known. I remember a certain pine- 
grove in old Narragansett, where, five years ago, 
many cartloads of forest earth, and hundreds of 
plants of the longed-for Mayflower, were placed 
with intelligent thought and loving care by 
flower-g^wers of experience. Soil and plants 
had been conveyed from a pine-grove only 
three miles distant. Both were placed under 
the same kind of pine-trees, and the same sized 
trees, and at like distances apart, affording 
thus the same light and the same shade. Both 
groves were at equal distance from the shore 
of the bay ; both had occasional stone boulders ; 
both had the same growth of underbrush. 
Three transplantings were made, to try differ- 
ent seasons and conditions. Did these cher- 
ished Mayflowers "grow weU and spread 
rapidly"? Not one plant is now living! I 
searched diligently this spring, and found not 
even a single rusty leaf. 

The handsome book entitled "The Flower 
Beautiful," is a natural product of our present 
interest in flowers ; it treats of their decorative 
use within doors, and is divided into three 
phases of the subject, — Ist, their relation to 
one another : 2d, their relation to the recep- 
tacle ; 3d, the relation of the whole composi- 
tion to its environment. The text of this book, 
curiously enough, is much more satisfactory 
than the illustrations from photographic re- 
productions ; for we miss color, of course, in the 
latter, though it is very distinctly conveyed to 
us by the author's glowing words, which have 
an extraordinary power of vivid presentation. 
I will not dwell on his instructions as to the re- 
lation of flowers to each other, for I find no in- 
clination among folk who arrange flowers at 
all to place sweet-peas with asters, from which 
horror he warns us. We have all learned to 
place each flower-family by itself in its vase. 
The question of this flower-holder is ever a wide- 
ly considered one. Mr. Weed gives us many 
beautiful examples of the fine Japanese jars 
and vases for flower-holding: and though he 
tells of glass vases, only one of his fifty-six illas- 
trations displays a glass receptacle, and that 
scarc-ely an artistic one — a glass tumbler. 
Yet the beautiful and varied glass vases, such 
as Mrs. Jekyll's " Munstead Glasses." and even 
the simpler globular and flaring cylindrical 
forms, are deemed by many flower-lovers our 
choicest flower-holders. With transparent

vases we have the beauty of the flower-stems 
added to the blossoms. 

Nor does the author even speak of the splen- 
did bowls, jars, and ewer-forms of brass and 
copper of oriental and barbaric make, and the 
graceful metal jars for various domestic uses 
in more civilized but simple communities. The 
copper jars are so fine for all the tawny, dull- 
red and Spanish-pink tints of our native lilies, 
and our garden-strays — for the azaleas and 
rhododendrons (not purple ones) of our woods 
and gardens, for our strangely-tinted peonies 
and dahlias and hollyhocks and gladioli and 
bleeding-heart ; and the brass bowls are so fine 
for iris and lupine, and both are invaluable for 
great bunches of flowering shrubs and fruit 
trees — for dog-wood and choke-cherry and 
lilacs and snowballs, and for many of our 
coarser wild-flowers. 

However, this book is not of wild-flowers ; 
illustrations and text are of garden-blooms. 
One vase of yellow lilies, one of golden-rod, 
one of lady's-slipper, and a single plant of tway- 
blade and trillium, seem a scant showing of 
wild-flowers for indoors to one who has a vase, 
bowl, or dish for each and every wild-flower, 
from pussy-willow, blood-root, hepatica, may- 
flower, Solomon's seal, columbine, through are- 
thusa, calopogon, ladies' tresses, grass of Par- 
nassus, and the last gentians, butter-and-eggs, 
and golden-rod. Of course it takes many years 
to fill such a vase-closet ; Mrs. Celia Thaxter 
had one with vases for every kind and color 
of poppies. 

In one or two points I differ from Mr. 
Weed. I find no need for warning flower- 
gatherers and vase-fillers not to " prefer expen- 
sive hot-house exotics to the beautiful flowers 
that surround us out-doors." Such a preference 
no longer exists, or is even fashionable. On the 
contrary, I find our greenhouses given over to 
the forcing for the market of simple " country " 
flowers, such as wall-flowers, stock, spiraeas, 
deutzias, lilacs, sweet-peas, etc. Nor can I share 
his preference for the China aster. He calls 
it a favorite flower, " universally beloved," and 
deems it one of our most valued plants for in- 
door decoration. I do not find it popular nor 
beloved ; and see many reasons why it is not 
suitable for in-door decoration. The foliage is 
not refined ; the flowers are top-heavy ; the 
colors are often crude. The author names these 
tints of his Truffant asters : " bright rose-pink, 
aster-purple, mauve, magenta, auricula-purple, 
deep maroon," — not an alluring list. The 
Comet aster, of which there are half-a-dozen 



illustrations, is to me a specially unpleasing 
variety. The stems of asters are coarse but 
weak, and almost always must be cut short 
even when the growth is tall ; therefore the 
arrangement in vases is necessarily stiff. Even 
Mr. Weed's photographs, fine as they are, prove 
this. And one-quarter of his illustrations are 
of asters, — he is a faithful champion where he 
loves. 

There can be no variety in arrangement with 
asters. Compare the aster plates in this book 
with the charming photographs of sweet-peas, 
the artistic ones of the trollius, the double- 
buttercup of our old garden, or, still more 
varied in outline and charm, the beautiful pop- 
pies. These poppy photographs are perfection. 

A special teaching of the book — the signi- 
ficance and value of flowers in the school-room, 
the ways to use them, and to awaken interest 
in them, — is given with special force. And, 
indeed, the whole book is full both of power 
and charm for all " out-doorlings " in every 
page from cover to cover.

A Quartette of Bird-Books.* 

The study of American ornithology has arrived 
at a happy stage in its development. The gun 
is falling into disuse, as a needless, not to say 
cruel, accessory ; and the opera-glass and cam- 
era are taking its place. Scientists have had 
the birds in the earlier settled portions of the 
continent under consideration for upward of 
two centuries. The species and their varia- 
tions have been determined and recorded with 
a minuteness and accuracy which leave little 
work of the sort yet to be done. " What we 
want now," remarks a distinguished authority, 
" is knowledge of the living, not the dead, bird. 
A thoroughly exhaustive account of the habits 
of any of our commonest birds is still to be 
written." With the wide-spread interest awak- 
ened in this charming and gifted race, the 
desired information concerning their individual 
traits and habits promises to be amply supplied.

Earnest observers among both old and young 
are rising up in every locality, and those in 
possession of a ready pen are relating the sig- 
nificant facts in their experience for the benefit 
of inquiring readers. From these sources the 
general fund of information is constantly en- 
larging, while the importance and attractive 
nature of the subject are coming to be more 
justly appreciated. 

A second contribution from Miss Effie Big- 
nell, author of the popular " Mr. Chupes and 
Miss Jenny," makes us acquainted with a con- 
siderable range of out-door life with which she 
has established relations of confiding friendli- 
ness by her gentle and judicious management. 
" My Woodland Intimates," as she properly 
names them, comprise birds of many kinds, 
indiscriminate cotton-tails, and a family of be- 
witching squirrels. Miss Bignell has availed 
herself of the favorable opportunities afforded 
a dweller in the country, for keeping her in- 
timates under daily notice. She acknowledges 
their claim upon her sympathy, as a superior 
yet kindred personality, and by simple observ- 
ances is mindful of their comfort. She spreads 
a table for them on a window-ledge in winter, 
and in a safe resort under the trees in summer. 
Cracked corn, seeds of the sunflower and maple, 
sweepings of the hay-loft, nuts, moistened bread, 
crumbled dog-biscuit, even cuttings of apple 
and banana, are provided to suit the varied 
tastes of her pretty pensioners. The wounded 
and disabled are tenderly cared for until able 
to resume their independent habits. In return 
for her faithful attentions, she receives touch- 
ing evidences of affection. She is welcomed 
and followed in her walks by bands of her 
feathered friends, who suffer a close approach 
with undoubted pleasure, and by expressive 
tones and gestures give token of real gratitude. 

A sharp controversy has lately occurred in 
the magazines over alleged exaggerations in 
describing the behavior of wild animals, espe- 
cially in their methods of parental discipline. 
Miss Bignell notes an example of stern school- 
ing among them, which lends credence to 
various disputed stories bearing on this latter 
point. A pair of red squirrels were her intim- 
ates of long standing, the female showing par- 
ticular familiarity and daring. She was an 
habitue of Balsam Bough Tavern, and brought 
her young infant to share in its bounties. Of 
their family life and discipline, Miss Bignell 
writes : 

" I have never before witnessed such heroic bringing 
up, such Spartan training, as that bestowed on her off- 



spring by this little squirrel lady during one day the 
baby spent in the table cThote neighborhood. Early in 
the morning I saw her leading the tender, inexperienced 
little creature to perilous heights among the maples, — 
eminences from which on every occasion he promptly fell 
to the ground with a thud suggestive of the destruction 
of his entire internal economy. Over and over I went 
to the little flattened-out creature, expecting to find 
him dead; but he never failed to pick himself up as 
.soon as his scattered wits and suspended breath re- 
turned. Once or twice he approached me and took 
refuge in my lap, but at his mother's angry call and 
chatter he left me and returned to her. We saw her 
vigorously trouncing and disciplining the poor baby 
throughout the entire day, and one of our number in- 
sists that on two or three occasions the Spartan mother 
slapped her child to give him confidence ! " 

Miss Bignell finally interfered and took the 
baby under her permanent protection. It 
throve, and grew into a family pet, half 
squirrel-like and half human. From the 
samples above quoted, the value of the au- 
thor's studies of her furred and feathered in- 
timates is plainly apparent. 

None need be told that the " True Bird 
Stories from My Note-Books," by Mrs. Olive 
Thome Miller, are both engaging and authen- 
tic. Their prime purpose is the entertainment 
of children ; but the adultoneeopening the book 
will yield to the spell of a talented and engag- 
ing writer until the last page is finished. The 
stories are short and simple, each enveloping 
some curious incident in bird-life witnessed by 
the writer and attesting the infinite variety of 
disposition and accomplishment possible to the 
" tribes of burning plumage and choral voice." 
One surprising narrative is connected with the 
vocal achievements of the robin. A bird taken 
early from the nest had never learned the song 
of its forefathers. Observing its efforts to shape 
some sort of a coherent melody, a member of 
the family with whom it dwelt taught it to 
whistle "Yankee Doodle." The robin caught 
the tune perfectly, and it was thenceforth the 
sole song in its repertory. Another robin, that 
was confined near a parrot, learned to say 
" Aunt Maria " with the same distinctness as 
its clever tutor. It is claimed by some natur- 
alists that all singing birds may develop a 
faculty for speech. When the robin, the canary, 
the goldfinch, the magpie, and the crow have 
acquired the art, who shall say the capacity is 
wanting in any member of the group of Oscines? 
Mrs. Miller adds her testimony to the evidence 
that animals are not insensible to the necessity 
of a rigorous training of the young. One in- 
stance of this kind, relating to the whip-poor- 
will, is thus given by her :

[June 1, 



" One evening after the whip-poor-will had sung for 
some weeks, I was s\irprised to hear a droll baby voice 
trying to imitate his notes. On listening, I found that 
the elder was teaching the youngster — actually giving 
him a music lesson. First the perfect song rang out 
loud and clear, and the weak, quavering voice tried to 
copy it. Then the singer repeated the strain, and the 
infant tried again. So it went on night after night, till 
the little one could sing almost as well as his father." 

The appearance of a new edition of Thomas 
Nuttall's manual of the " Birds of the United 
States and Canada " is an event to be noted 
with pleasure. The earlier two-volumed form 
is now compressed into one, and in addition to 
the original wood-cuts the text is illuminated 
by a series of colored plates representing 110 
species. The name of Thomas Nuttall, " The 
English-American," is held by later ornitho- 
logists in high respect. Botany was his first 
choice in the field of natural science ; but while 
collecting the plants native to this country, he 
found place in his heart for love of the birds, 
and time in his absorbing pursuits to give them 
keen and careful observation. The first vol- 
ume of his treatise on ornithology was pub- 
lished in 1832, and the second in 1834. It 
was the first " handbook " on American birds 
accessible to the student, and was prized as 
the work of an expert in scientific methods, 
and one with a fine feeling for the beauties of 
his theme. Wilson treated about 280 species, 
in his great work on the birds of the United 
States. Audubon followed, with his magnificent 
illustrations of 506 species. Nuttall describes 
a little more than 200, but with much breadth 
of knowledge and nicety of detail. After con- 
sulting the many authorities who have come 
after him, we may still go back to his pages 
for useful bits of information not to be met 
with elsewhere. 

The picture facing the title-page of "The 
Story of a Bird Lover," by Mr. W. E. D. Scott, 
is a flash-light into the very heart of the au- 
thor. He is sitting in the centre of a spacious 
room, with scores of wild birds, eating, drink- 
ing, bathing, flying, singing, or resting quietly 
on their perches. One has alighted on the gen- 
tleman's finger ; another on his head, apparently 
with felonious intent on his hair ; another, on 
his shoulder; while others are in various atti- 
tudes close around him. He is at home among 
them, they are at home with him, and all are 
on the friendliest terms with each other. It is 
a captivating scene, and a truthful rendering of 
daily occurrences in the bird-lover's experience. 
Mr. Scott has been associated with Princeton 



University, as curator of the Department of 
Ornithology, for over thirty years. He was the 
founder of the Museum which does honor, in 
the extent and value of its collections, to him 
and to Princeton. He has travelled widely in 
search of material with which to stock the de- 
partment over which he presides. He has spent 
years in the wild regions of the states east and 
west, and has gleaned a store of fresh knowl- 
edge from the book which Nature opens to all 
earnest seekers. His natural fondness for the 
birds was developed into the serious pursuits 
of the scientist while a student at Cornell and 
Harvard under the direction of such teachers 
as Burt Wilder, Louis Agassiz, and Jeffries 
Wyman. The plain unvarnished tale of his 
adventures could not fail to have many pas- 
sages awakening sympathy and interest. Mr. 
Scott is at present striving to solve certain 
problems in evolution by an intimate study of 
birds in captivity. He has some five hundred 
individuals housed in six rooms in his home, 
and, providing them with conditions in accord 
with their habits, allows them the utmost free- 
dom possible to the circumstances. It is an 
experiment of ambitious dimensions, and it is 
hoped that commensurate results will accrue 
from it. In his revelation of avian idiosyn- 
cracies, Mr. Scott has not a more curious story 
to unfold than that of a pet crow, which some 
may pronounce a very wise bird, and others a 
very silly one. 

" This bird was allowed large liberty, was very tame, 
and, with the traditional crow propensity for mischief, 
played many pranks, both edifying and provoking, and 
some of them almost inconceivable. He would pick a 
rose from the garden, bring it to the steps of the piazza, 
and then carefully remove each petal, laying them in a 
pile. After this was finished, one by one he would care- 
fully remove each leaf to the step below, making a new 
heap there. There were three steps to this piazza, and 
for hours he would move his rose-leaves from one step to 
another, up and down, seeming to find infinite satisfac- 
tion in the process. The whole was accompanied by 
much gabble, doubtless in crow language, which seemed 
to me to indicate at times great pleasure, and at other 
times rage and irritation, when the wind would disturb 
his pile of leaves and he had to restore order from 
chaos." 

Verily, a sable Sisyphus, with a self-imposed 
task, futile and mysterious !

Nature not only speaks a various language, 
but in these later years she is speaking a great 
deal through the mouths of almost innumer- 
able interpreters. Life in those sinks of ha- 
manity, oar cities, turns for recreation to 
simpler methods of living and more natural sur- 
roundings, — and turns, too, for re-creation as 
well. Mr. Howells has noted that, in America 
at least, city people are all country people, 
either by actual birth or by the remove of a 
degree or two ; and interest in the open terri- 
tory adjacent is inevitable. Of the sentiment 
of that cynical Frenchman whose solitary ob- 
jection to the city was that it is surrounded by 
country, there is little or nothing in these 
United States. Certainly it does not have 
itself put into books that bring with them a 
sense of expansiveness and a freer air, at once 
finer and more delicate. Growing luxury too 
plays its part, as well as the widespread imi- 
tation of English life : it is not too much to 
say that the twentieth-century ambition of the 
well-to-do among Americans is to live in both 
the city and country, free to go from one to 
the other as the desire seizes them. 

Of recent writers on the various moods of 
Nature, few have the outer eye and inward 
vision of Mr. Charles Goodrich Whiting. In 
his hours of labor a member of that most mod- 
em and most urban of crafts, the newspaper 
profession, he has set up an efficacious antidote 
to its exacting requirements in long rambles 
through that blessed New England country- 
side where scenes as wild as ever greeted the 
eye of a Wampanoag or Narragansett are 
within easy reach of the city dweller. With 
a tried companion, Mr. Solomon Stebbins, to 
whom he dedicates his " Walks in New En- 
gland " as " the best man of wood and field I 
ever knew," he has rambled over hill and dale, 
forest and meadow, marsh and rock, and gained 
from all their secret of delight. It is not in 
the gentle spring, nor radiant summer, nor 
crispy autumn alone that he has sought to dis- 
cern the inartificial world, but during rain and 
snow, bitter cold and sultry heat, until he has 
been able to see Nature whole and let his read- 
ers enjoy with him the profoundest of her 
secrets.

The handsome volume is made up of little 
papers in prose, embellished by many repro- 
ductions of photographs. These not sufficing 
to convey all that he has to say, Mr. Whiting 
tnrns to verse, seeking and finding his inspira- 
tion for it close to Nature's heart. Nor are the 
prose papers devoid of the essence of poetry. 
They contain innumerable excerpts from the 
poets, especially from the older American 
poets ; and it is here that the reader familiar 
with the writings of the younger singers of 
Canada and America wishes that Mr. Whiting 
could have acquainted himself with their work 
as weU. But the spirit of the entire book is 
based upon accurate observation animated by 
imagination, as may be seen in the following 
passage from the essay called " A Sabbath in 
the Open" : 

" Now surely the spells of the frost are loosened, and 
those skunk cabbages that choose, and that have not har- 
ried too much, will presently be humming all over their 
spadixes with pollen-scattering flowers, — for there is 
sound in this work of reproduction, though onr ears are 
not finely enough attuned to distingnish it. Our yet im- 
perfect senses miss a hundred shades and hues and tints 
of colour, which artists are ever striving to discover and 
fix on canvas ; they cannot see light where multitudes 
of living things of so-called lower orders do see light 
and go about their businesses; they cannot catch the 
myriad overtones even of the musical instruments we 
make, no one of which, not even the subtle violin, ever 
registered the infinite delicacies and refinements of tone 
that vibrate to the spiritual sense; they cannot hear the 
corn grow, though they hear the water trickle and the 
frosts whisper; and even the movements of the ants in 
the ground, the beetles in the bark, the larvse in the 
wood, are only heard by a few whose trained ears have 
reached a neater touch of hearing." 

Fine as these things are, there some even 
finer in the attitude of Mr. Whiting toward 
that part of Nature which is often too little 
considered, — humanity. In such a paper as 
" A Far Easter in the Future," he ventures 
upon prediction, in part as follows : 

"The time shall come when there will be no more 
despoilment of man by his brother man; when wealth 
as now conceived will have become a meaningless term; 
when all things shall be done for the good of all and 
nothing for the good of one, — be that one king, em- 
peror, priest, president or great capitalist. The time 
shall come, — and then war will have become a hideous 
legend of the past, and no more shall men destroy the 
lives and hopes and happiness of other peoples for a 
little trivial aggrandizement and the interest of a few 
ignorant and pitiable men misled by false ideas. This 
is the Easter of the future."

strikingly like those of Mr. Whiting's. Orig- 
inally contributed to weekly papers, both re- 
ligious and secular, these little articles are 
always those of a city man consciously in the 
country and eager to lay off the complexities 
of civilization for the simplicities of open air 
and out-of-doors. As in so many cases where 
there is an honest love for Nature in all moods, 
there is manifest in his writing a keenness of 
the senses, of sight and sound and scent, de- 
nied — wisely, let us believe — to city dwellers. 
The sense of smell being so little in use among 
men tamed and domesticated, it is a pleasure 
to come upon such a passage as this : 

" To me, the most ethereal and delicious moment of 
this pursuit of spring is the time when, as we say, 
spring is first 'in the air.' The expectation of the 
new budding year is never quite so thrilling, so trans- 
porting — Thoreau calls it ' exciting ' — as then. That 
first changing of the air, in late February and early 
March, from the winter quality to the spring quality, — 
have you not remarked it with all your senses, and been 
mysteriously and irresistibly elated and exalted thereby, 
as if body and soul were suddenly set in perfect tune 
with the music of the spheres? And that earliest whiff 
of the soil — is there any perfume to compare with it 
in delicious suggestiveness ? How it recalls all the 
sweet youthfulness of life and nature ! I know of 
nothing like the smell of the soil to bring back the 
zestful, care-free days of boyhood, and to thrill the 
soul with intimations and prophecies of its own and 
Nature's eternal youth." 

Equally devoted to the worship of Nature, 
but from a practical and more prosaic point 
of view, is Mr. Harry Robert's " The Tramp's 
Handbook." Here one may learn how to put 
oneself in the way of the delights that Messrs. 
Whiting and Buckham expatiate upon so de- 
lightfully, — what to take when on a tramp, how 
to tie knots, contrive packsaddles, set traps for 
live things, make and break camp, light fires, 
.cook food, dry clothing, and the like. It is a book 
written primarily for wandering life in England, 
and many a plainsman and mountaineer in 
America could add to its recommendations ; 
but it is in full accord with the natural instinct 
that sends the people of the English race a- wan- 
dering betimes, and it is small enough to be 
carried in the pocket. Mr. Roberts, though he 
mentions the soldier and traveller as those to 
whom his work should appeal, takes for his 
motto the finely regardless old phrase, " It 
shall be what o'clock I say it is," and specifies 
a more direct appeal to primitive instincts thus : 

"When we come really to think and experiment for 
ourselves, we discover that the so-called comforts and 
luxuries of our civilization are but the counters (or coun- 
terfeit coins) for which we have been taught to sacrifice 
our true inheritance of dignity and leisure. But com- 



monly, before this discovery breaks in upon us, we have 
given hostages and signed contracts whereby our re- 
version is mortgaged to the hilt, and we have nothing 
left but to turn cynics and bark at every spectre of our 
might-have-been. Some of us are bold enough to fix 
a muzzle over the surly jaws of conscience, to repudiate 
our contracts, to sacrifice our hostages, and escape with 
the remains of our divine legacy into the backwoods of 
life. On the whole, I think it is such who will derive 
most value from this little book, the aim of which is 
merely to tell those who are fresh from the civilized 
world how they may most simply nourish and protect 
their bodies without sacrificing their spiritual lives at 
the altar of the devil of a commercial age." 

Most appropriate to the spirit of the book is 
the inclusion of a glossary of Romany words, 
and a bibliography of books which may be 
handily carried on such tramps as the author 
describes, all of them selected with discrimin- 
ation and intelligence.

Books about Trees and Shrubs.* 

It is not likely that forestry will ever rival 
bird and animal study as a popular diversion. 
It utterly lacks both the human and the epic 
interest of the latter, — and incidentally the 
controversial, so strong just now between the 
" scientists " and the " nature students," to 
borrow the Rev. Mr. Long's terminology for 
the two schools. Plant psychology rests on too 
slight a foundation, and merges too easily into 
pathetic fallacy, to seem remunerative to the 
average man ; and the pleasure of the quest is 
marred by the fact that the tree, once found, 
is permanently placed, while the bird flits tan- 
talizingly on to the next thicket. But we have 
lately made fairly sure of the bird. The thicket 
remains, — a bewildering tangle of trees, shrubs 
and vines, more interesting because less fa- 
miliar than the small plants that blossom in its 
shadow. So the tree, hitherto the most neg- 
lected object in nature, is beginning to claim 
its share of attention. Forest preservation is 
coming to be ranked on a par with the work of 
the Audubon Society, and landscape gardening 
is taking its place beside gardening proper as 
an art equally absorbing and worthy of culti- 
vation. 

And with the popular interest in trees come

the popular books about them. Three of these, 
recently published, serve to suggest how wide 
is the field of research and from how many re- 
munerative points of view it may be overlooked. 
Miss Harriet L. Keeler's work on " Our North- 
ern Shrubs and How to Identify Them " makes 
its claim to attention largely through its pict- 
ures, which supplement the clear and terse de- 
scriptions so perfectly that the reader can with 
a minimum of trouble identify any shrub he 
is likely to come upon, particularly if it is in 
flower. Mr. H. E. Parkhurst covers a wider 
field in his account of the " Trees, Shrubs, and 
Vines of the Northeastern United States." His 
aim is much like Miss Keeler's, — to acquaint 
the reader with the distinguishing character- 
istics and ornamental value of each species 
described. But his method of approach is 
entirely different, and the basis of his analyti- 
cal keys is generally the leaf instead of the 
flower. Miss Maud Going, the author of the 
third book under consideration, is a nature 
essayist. Identification of species plays but a 
small part in her scheme of study. Her vol- 
ume called " With the Trees " contains a series 
of delightful rambling sketches, packed full 
of the tree lore of all the year, from the time 
» "When the Sap Stirs " to the fall of the leaf 
and the belated golden blossoming of the wych 
hazel. 

It seems almost superfluous to speak in de- 
tail of Miss Keeler's book on " Our Northern 
Shrubs," further than to say that its general 
plan is the same as that of her well-known 
and authoritative work on "Native Trees." 
She writes for the amateur botanist and the 
nature-lover who wishes a more complete or a 
more popular description of our wayside bushes 
and the commoner of our imported shrubs than 
is given by the ordinary text-book ; and partic- 
ularly for those who are interested in the dec- 
oration of city parks and boulevards, country 
roadsides, school yards, or their own home 
grounds, and who therefore wish a better un- 
derstanding of the habits and character of our 
native shrubs. To this end the shrubs are 
grouped by families (and why not furnish a 
key, at least for the larger families, in addition 
to the guide to genera?). Each of the two 
hundred and thirty species that are included is 
analyzed scientifically and described popularly, 
generally with especial reference to its origin 
and history, its hardihood, and its decorative 
possibilities. There are over two hundred 
plates from photographs and a number from 
drawings. The photographs, all of shrubs in 



flower or fruit, are very beautiful, and so clear 
as to make identification perfectly simple, often 
even without reference to the descriptions. 

Mr. Parkhurst's work on "Trees, Shrubs, 
and Vines " is necessarily more complicated, 
since it covers three times as much ground ; 
and being written in a less popular manner, 
it demands more effort on the part of the ama- 
teur reader. But such effort is well repaid. 
Considerably over half the book is occupied by 
analytical keys and botanical descriptions of 
trees, shrubs, and vines, native to the North- 
eastern United States, or foreign but culti- 
vated there. The descriptions are very simple ; 
in identifying specimens, no microscope work 
is required, and outline drawing of leaf forms 
and venation materially shorten the process. 
But the more characteristic portion of the book 
consists of several descriptive chapters, several 
more which deal specifically with the trees in 
the New York Central Park — a complete list of 
whose trees, shrubs and vines is given, — and 
one chapter devoted to the landscape features 
of a number of shrubs and vines. It is the 
amateur landscape gardener who will especially 
enjoy Mr. Parkhurst's book. The author's ovni 
bias toward that phase of the subject is clearly 
shown by his selection of Central Park as a 
basis for study. His enthusiasm is contagious ; 
one lays aside the book with a new and dis- 
criminating interest in landscape, and a wish 
to begin decorating something at once. 

Mr. Parkhurst is already known to students 
of nature through his books about birds ; Miss 
Going for hers about wild flowers. " With the 
Trees " ought to be read once, and then kept 
conveniently at hand to be read again by 
snatches. It is full of good things ; but the 
somewhat hit-or-miss arrangement of them, and 
the lack of transition from point to point, make 
it impossible to get hold of everything at first 
reading. However, what the style lacks in 
coherence it makes up in charm of allusion. 
Miss Going is equally familiar with reports of 
the Bureau of Ethnology and bulletins of the 
Department of Forestry, with Thoreau's deli- 
cate descriptions and White's quaint observa- 
tions. She understands the place of the trees 
in myth and folk-lore, in modern poetry, 
Indian handicraft, and the economy of nations. 
These matters, however, are side-issues, subor- 
dinated to a more strictly scientific interest, in 
the vital processes of the trees : where they 
live, how they get their food, how they grow and 
multiply. Methods of wind and insect pollin- 
ation, and curious devices for seed distribution,

are perhaps the special topics accorded fullest 
and most vivid presentation. Such chapter 
titles as " In a Hillside Pasture," " The Life of 
the Leaves," " The Cone-Bearers, and their 
Kin," " Trees of Streets, Parks, and Gardens," 
" Seed-Time and Sowing," will suggest the in- 
formal method of the book and the wide range 
of interests covered. The essays are beauti- 
fully illustrated from photographs. 

All three books are attractively bound and 
well printed. Any one of them is certain to 
direct and stimulate an interest in a fascinating 
branch of nature-study.

There is an Egyptian proverb that "who drinks 
Nile water must return." Something of the charm 
of this nursery of the world's art and civilization, 
of its interesting people and its wonderful climate, 
appears in Mr. R. Talbot Kelly's artistic work on 
Egypt, and rouse in the reader a thirst for the 
water of the Nile. "To its sunshine and air, more 
than to anything else, is due perhaps that subtle and 
mysterious charm which all who have ever been to 
Egypt unconsciously feel." The mellow warmth of 
the Egyptian atmosphere, and the brilliant coloring 
of its landscape under the transfiguring light of its 
sunshine, are brought forcibly to the reader's atten-

tion by the seventy-five colortypes of the author's 
paintings, which deal not only with landscape sub- 
jects, but also with the life of the people in city 
streets, among the fellahin of the Delta and the 
Bedawin of the desert. The technical work on these 
plates is most excellent, and as illustrations they are 
exquisite. The idealized Egypt which we enjoy in 
these illustrations we find also in the text. The 
author is evidently an optimist, and no misfortune 
perturbs his wholesome view of life, or shocks his 
faith in his fellow-men. He is ever ready to appre- 
ciate their point of view, and to excuse their short- 
comings. " Robbery, with which their name is often 
associated, is usually more or less incidental, and 
not a habit, and from their point of view is to some 
extent justifiable. I noticed, on one occasion, a 
sheykh's -son wearing a lady's green silk dressing- 
gown, and on my asking him where he got it he 
rather ambiguously replied, ' Well you see, Allah 
has given those dirty Egyptians all that fat land, 
where they can see their food growing before them, 
while our inheritance is this desert.' Then, mean- 
ingly, ' we take toll of the desert.' " The author 
writes from personal experience of the Egypt and 
Egyptians of to-day, especially of those parts of 
which tourists see but little if any. His comments 
on the simplicity and courtesy and hospitality of the 
people in these untrodden paths are in strange con- 
trast with the tales of travellers who follow beaten 
paths where the contamination of the backsheesh 
has left its blight. He is proud of the material 
prosperity which English control has brought to the 
country, and especially to the fellahin, and of the 
record for fair dealing and honesty which the En- 
glish officials have established. " I speak as an 
Englishman " is the strongest appeal which the pro- 
testing native makes for his veracity. The greatest 
portending evil is the industrial situation caused 
by the irrigation works and increased demand for 
labor which the native race cannot supply, owing 
largely to the excessive (ninety per cent) death-rate 
among children. This he attributes to the low es- 
tate of women among the fellahin, where, owing to 
Moslem influences, she has little legal and social and 
less religious recognition. It is different among the 
Bedawin, where " she is helpmeet and companion 
to her lord, and with her children is treated with 
devotion and respect ; and I believe that the Arab 
word ' watan ' is the only equivalent in any language 
for the English word ' home.' " The book is valu- 
able for its artistic comments on Egyptian atmos- 
phere, landscapes, architecture, and domestic arts, 
interesting because of its sympathetic insight into the 
conditions and problems of Egyptian social life of 
today, and commendable for the wholesome spirit 
which pervades its pages. 

Mr. A. Henry Savage Lander's Thibetan exploits 
have made his fame as a traveller secure. Readers 
of his travels "Across Coveted Lands" will find in

tures he narrates are less thrilling than in his former 
work. His route lay from Baku across the Caspian

Sea to Enzeli, and thence tbroogh Persia and the 
conntrT of the Belaehs to India. The anthor's in- 
teresta and bis point of view are political, militaiy, 
and commercial, rather than humanistic, scientific, 
or esthetic. His book is a plea for the extension of 
British inflaence and trade in these coveted lands, 
and for comity rather than strife with Rassia, whose 
persistent, unwavering policy of extension is rapidly 
invading Northern Persia. He also bemoans what 
Mr. Prichard in his book calls the " brusque nn- 
adaptability of the Englishman," and insists upon 
the desirability that men for commercial pursaita 
should be well trained in modern languages, and 
that the powers of observation should be developed 
by the study of the sciences. To these factors he 
attributes much of German and American progress 
in recent years. The regions described in this work 
are lands without forests, daily scorched by heat, 
pinched by cold, and swept by ceaseless winds. 
Something of the monotony of the landscape and 
the life of the people has crept into these volume*, 
so that the reader welcomes any diversion, — even 
the exploits of the Persian cats, the anthor's com- 
panions on this long journey. The manufacture of 
" ancient carpets " is one of the most lucrative in- 
dustries in Persia. The desired antiquity is secured 
by spreading the new carpet in the middle of the 
street of the bazaar to be trampled by foot passen- 
gers, donkeys, mules, and camels, for days or weeks, 
the value of the goods rising as the wear increases. 
Lovers of oriental carpets will find many references 
to methods of manufacture and types of rugs pro- 
daeed in the different localities. The book is abund- 
antly and handsomely illustrated by reproduetioaa 
of excellent photographs taken by the author, and 
is a most valuable and welcome addition to oar 
sources of information concerning lands of rising 
political and commercial importance. 

Travel by sea to-day has been robbed of its ter- 
rors, not only by steam and steel, but by the patient, 
plodding, and little-known labors of the '"Survey" 
ships of oar own and other nations. They map the 
coasts, discover and plot the shoals and hidden 
rocks, and register the tides and currents with such 
aeeuraey that the good ship makes port safely be- 
cause of their labors. For four years Dr. A. Aleoek 
was attached, as Surgeon and Naturalist, to the 
Ship "Investigator." of the Royal Indian Marine 
Survey cruising in Indian Seas. The field of opera- 
tions of this ship included the coasts of Hindoostan 
and Burmah. the Bay of Bengal, and the Anda- 
man and Laccadfve Seas, with the adjacent islands 
of coral origin. Her ports of call are not on the 
itinerary of any globe-trotter, and even the trading 
ships shun many of her routes. Dr. Alcock, in his 
narrative of " A Naturalist in Indian Seas," has 
clothed the story of his cruises with great interest, 
principally by his clever description of the work 
which a Survey ship undertakes, and by his always 
novel account of the spoils of the sea which the 
trawl brought up from the vasty deep. These are 
abundantly illustrated. There are also accounts of 



the peoples and the life on the various islets visited 
by the ship. Mingled with the science, which is 
excellent, there is some philosophy, and some quiet 
humor which, while it is not often found in works 
of British scientists, is none the less pleasing. There 
have been several books in the past dealing with 
the discoveries of the " Challenger." the '• Blake," 
and the more recent German expeditions, most of 
which are more comprehensive, and contain more 
scientific detail than is found in Dr. Alcock's pages. 
There is. however, none which portrays so briefly, 
so clearly, and with interest so well sustained 
throughout, the life of the depths of the sea, its 
wonderful adaptations to conditions of darkness, 
cold, and great preesare, its bizarre and canons 
forms, and its interesting and instructive associa- 
tions of commensal organisms in these abysmal sol- 
itudes. Much fresh material was brought to light 
by the work of the " Investigator," and aboat a 
third of Dr. Alcock's book is given over to a more 
technical account of these discoveries, to a list of 
the dredging stations, and a bibliography of the 
scientific pablieations dealing with the material 
broaght to light by these explorations. The book 
is therefore of great technical value, as well as 
popular interest. 

The discovery, in recent years, in Patagonia, of 
the fossil remains of a giant sloth christened mylodon 
by the palssntologists, has led to conjectures that 
this curious relic of the past might be found still 
living in the forest fastnesses at the bare of the 
Andes. The London "Daily Express." with com- 
mendable enterprise, outfitted a scientific expedition 
in 1900, to search for the monster. The quest was 
fruitless ; but the leader of the expedition, Mr. H. 
Hesketh Prichard, in his " Through the Heart of 
Patagonia," has broaght before the public an inter- 
esting account of the expedition. The writings of 
Darwin, Agassiz, Bates, and Hudson have revealed 
the plains and forests of South America as the 
naturalist sees them. It is in like tenor that Mr. 
Prichard has developed his book. — a fitting addi- 
tion to an already memorable list of naturalists' 
wanderings in the southern continent. Darwin 
touched only the fringes of Patagonia ; but Prichard 
was enabled to push his explorations across the 
plains to the glacier-fed lakes, to gain an intimate 
knowledge of the fast disappearing Tehaelche tribe, 
and to learn much of the ways of wild animals in 
regions where man's destructive habits are unknown 
and unfeared by wild things. The writer is ob- 
servant, quite as much of men as of nature; and 
his story never lacks interest. The illustrations, 
from photographs, are numerous and excellent; 
and there are also seven plates in color, by J. G. 
MiUais, of birds and mammals, which in composi- 
tion and color are hardly equal to the work of 
American artists in this field. 

Interest in many lines centres in Dr. Carl Peters's 
" Eldorado of the Ancients." His preface contains 
his justification for the acts of cruelty for which he 
was relieved of the governorship of German East

Africa. His main thesis is that the gold of Ophir of 
David and Solomon came from South Africa ; that 
the land of Ophir ( Afur), or Punt of the Egyptians, 
was reached by trading ships which ascended the 
Zambesi, and that the word Africa itself may be 
derived from the ancient name of this legendary 
country. The evidence which the author marshals 
in support of his contention is convincing: Semitic 
customs and mot words in the language and geog- 
raphical names of native tribes in the gold country, 
ancient records in Egypt, and Egyptian antiquities 
in the regions of Rhodesia and Portuguese East 
Africa, where immense areas bear evidence of sur- 
face workings and mines of prodigious extent of 
prehistoric origin. The author describes his ex- 
plorations in the kingdom of Macombe, whom the 
Portuguese have never subdued, and in adjacent 
British territory. His comments on the undevel- 
oped resources of this country, and on the political 
and industrial situation in South Africa, are both 
interesting and opportune. German developments 
in this part of the world in the next few years will 
be watched with interest by all readers of Dr. 
Peters's book. Uncommercialized readers will take 
strong issue with the author's view of the labor 
problem in South Africa. He rightly deplores the 
unwillingness of the blacks to work, and the inad- 
equacy of the usual penalties of civilized procedure 
in restraining petty crime ; and justly claims that 
the blacks should make some return to the com- 
munity for security of life and property which the 
advent of civilization has brought to them. He de- 
plores the " Uncle Tom " sentimentality, and the 
interference of Exeter Hall ideals with the regula- 
tion of the relations of the races in this land. Only 
practical men, who have to do with the difficulties, 
should be allowed to determine the policy. His so- 
lution is " forced labor " under government control. 
Each negro should be compelled to work at least six 
months in each year for a white man, or he should 
be compelled to work for the state for twelve years 
at the munificent salary of shelter, food, and two 
shillings a month, with the privileges of Sunday 
and marrying ! The state would make its profit by 
hiring the blacks, at an advance, to the mine-owners. 
Here lies the joker in this benevolent scheme. 
May Exeter Hall and Herr Bebel long live to 
prevent any such exploitation of native races by the 
machinery of the state for the remote object of in- 
culcating in future generations of blacks an appre- 
ciation of the benefits of toil and the immediate 
purpose of creating dividends for foreign corpora- 
tions ! The author mentions with approval the 
successful work of Bishop Hartzell in industrial 
education of the blacks in the American mission 
schools at Umtali. New motives, new needs, new 
desires, and new capabilities, which are thus in- 
spired in the few, will in time leaven the race and 
afford a solution of the labor problem in its present 
form. 

Sketches of sojourn in the Gatinais, Bourbonnais, 
and Champagne are published by Miss Betham- 



Edwards under the title of " East of Paris." The 
author is an English lady, an " offioier de l' Instruc- 
tion Publique de France" and she writes with an 
artist's appreciation of the picturesque, an histo- 
rian's keenness for all that links the present with 
the past, and a gentle appreciation of French folk 
and their ways that belies her British ancestry. 
Among other things, we find an interesting account 
of Nemours, a favorite haunt of Balzac, but to-day 
without a book-shop ! Near this place, at Episy, 
was projected the chapel and a mound in memory 
of the Polish patriot Kosciusko, who spent the last 
fifteen years of his life in the village. Pro-Russian 
politics have forbidden the completion of the chapel 
by the villagers. Students of contemporary history 
and politics will appreciate the chapter of this work 
dealing with Germanized Alsace and Lorraine. 
The point of view of the author on this subject i» 
frankly French ; but it will be a hardened Teuton 
who will not agree that, for Catholic French- 
speaking Lorraine at least, the present national 
boundary drawn and maintained by the sword i» 
most unfortunate. Six dainty colored plates, after 
paintings by Mr. Henry Detmold, adorn the book. 

In his " European Days and Ways," General 
James F. Rusling aims to give " a common-sense 
account of Europe as it is." We find a plain 
straightforward unvarnished tale of travel from 
Italy to Scotland by way of most of the great centres 
of interest on the Continent, — a tale which contains 
the frank comments of a practical American man 
of affairs upon European peoples and customs, told 
without art or restraint. The book is packed — not 
padded — with information. We learn how many 
counterpanes and salt-cellars the good ship " Aller " 
carried, how many square yards there are in St. 
Peters, the daily per capita consumption of beer in 
Munich, and the number of guns Wellington had 
at Waterloo. This information, together with the 
comments on hotels, pensions, churches, galleries, 
and railways, makes the work a fair sort of a guide- 
book. The author is intensely American, loyal to his 
country, its rulers, and its institutions, to his faith 
and his temperance principles. Because of this 
purpose and this point of view, and withal because 
of the shrewdness and scope of the observations, 
the book is a valuable human document. It will 
strike a responsive chord in many Americans whose 
views are not usually placed in print. His com- 
ments are not, however, to our credit in every in- 
stance, — as, for example, his discussion of the relative 
cost of municipal government in London and New

importance. Hence this book, which is a running 
commentary on conditions now prevalent in that 
land, is of more than passing interest. The author, 
the son of an ex-president of Colombia, is well qual- 
ified to interpret nature and the natives whom he 
meets. The book is written with Castilian senti- 
ment, fluency, and ease, and in style is unique 
among recent books of travel. To this enjoyable 
feature of the book there is added the novelty of a 
land little known, a land of illimitable llanos and 
impenetrable forests, of magnificent waterways 
and wonderful range of tropical resources, and of 
an uncivilized simple people, robbed and betrayed 
by their own governors, and by foreign traders 
who are their only revelation of a more enlightened 
world beyond the confines of their primeval 
solitudes. 

A brief account of the Arctic explorations of the 
Duke of the Abruzzi is found in his book entitled 
" Farther North than Nansen." The thin volume, 
of less than a hundred pages, is not so ponderous 
as the elaborate reports of his predecessors in the 
fight for fame in the Arctic ice, but it is no less 
interesting. Simplicity and directness mark the 
tale, which the reader is loth to drop till it is fin- 
ished. The Duke modestly claims that the achieve- 
ments of Arctic explorers have resulted in great 
material, commercial, and scientific benefits to the 
world. But these have little interest to most peo- 
ple, and, it may be, benefit them even less than the 
proof which such men as the author furnish that, 
with will, courage, and perseverance, man can dare 
anything, even though all the powers of Nature are 
in alliance against him. Surely, 86° 33' 49" of 
latitude stirs the pulses in every man of action. As 
a bit of book-making the volume leaves much to 
be desired, — lacking a table of contents, some 
subdivisions, a map, and an index. The pictures 
appear to have been taken in the twilight of the 
Arctic night, — for which the photographer may 
not be to blame, — and to have been printed with 
the grime of a London fog. 

Mr. Paul Fountain is an amateur naturalist who 
disdains the professional scientist and all his ways. 
But this has not interfered with his preparing a very 
readable account of his wanderings through "The 
Great Mountains and Forests of South America." 
He is a lover of the wilderness, and no hardship 
daunts him, no obstacle seems insurmountable. 
His journeys were made along the great Brazilian 
waterways, and through the Andes from Chili to 
Ecuador. He is a keen observer of nature, and gives 
in a matter-of-fact sort of way, without pretense 
to literary merit or claims of scientific value, a very 
full record of the beasts, birds, reptiles, fishes, and 
insects which he encountered. There is a lack of 
relief in the book; the map is missing, and the few 
illustrations might well have been omitted. 

Mr. S. G. Bayne, of New York, describes his trip 
" On an Irish Jaunting Car through Donegal and 
Connemara" for the edification of American citizens 
who do not have a first-band acquaintance with 



" the finest natural scenery in the world, and by all 
odds the greatest display of verdure in all its varj- 
ing shades and colors." The author knows Ireland 
too well to portray it to the uninitiated. Instead of 
giving as a picture of Ireland and the Irish of to- 
day and some insight into conditions affecting the 
Irish problem, he delves deeply into the ancient 
annals of *' The Four Masters," and embellishes his 
ride of 350 miles with historic incident and an oc- 
casional story. The illustrations, which are apt and 
taking, in a measure make up for this shortcoming. 
The charm of mountain-climbing, as well as ita 
hardships and great dangers, are revealed in Mr. J. 
Norman Collie's '■ Climbing on the Himalaya and 
Other Mountain Ranges." About half of the book 
is given to an account of various perilous ascents 
amid the peaks and glaciers of the Himalaya Moun- 
tains, while the remaining chapters are devoted to 
the Alps, the Lofoten Islands, and the mountains of 
Ireland. American enthusiasts in this field will find 
a comprehensive account of the Selkirks accessible 
from the Canadian Pacific Railway, and a good map, 
with routes, of this region, " the Switzerland of 
North America." Charles Atwood Kofoid.

story, and extending to nearly a hundred pages. 
We could say nothing of these stories that has not 
been said many times before. They are like their 
countless predecessors, and yet their charm is un- 
failing, and they may be read with a zest from 
which the edge is hardly worn, however familiar 
we may be with the scores, if not hundreds, that 
have delighted us in the earlier years. 

Mr. Arthur Sherburne Hardy, teacher, mathe- 
matician, editor, diplomatist, poet, and novelist, is 
a man whose ventures in the field of literature have 
been of such quality as to make the public wish 
that they were more frequent. His first novel, 
*' But Yet a Woman," was published fully twenty- 
five years ago, and must still be reckoned one of the 
best works of fiction that America has produced. 
Its successors, "Passe Rose" and "The Wind of 
Destiny," were slighter performances, but they had 
the rare charm of refined literary art, and rose re- 
freshingly superior to the current standards of our 
fiction. Now, after many years, we have another 
novel, "His Daughter First," which is a sequel to 
"The Wind of Destiny" in the sense that certain 
of the characters of the earlier novel reappear, al- 
though not in the sense of anything like continuity 
of plot. The new book is certainly charming, al- 
though we miss something of the delicate romantic 
feeling that characterized its predecessors, and are 
in many ways made conscious of the subtle dis- 
tinctions that must ever exist between youth and 
middle age, even in the modes of self-expression of 
the same personality. The modern note becomes 
almost jarring at times, especially when the specu- 
lations of the stock market are introduced as a mo- 
tive, but on the whole Mr. Hardy remains true to 
his finer artistic instincts. In a novel of strictly 
private and modern American interest, we must do 
without the glamour of the age of Charlemagne and 
the lofty old-world idealism of his first book ; what 
we get is careful delineation of character, and a 
skilfully contrived set of domestic relations that 
lead to the happiness of the chief persons con- 
cerned, after the usual entanglements without which 
a novel of this type cannot exist. 

Mr. George Cram Cook's story of the ill-starred 
Mexican Empire of the sixties fills us with a sense 
of wonder that this excellent romantic material has 
been so long neglected. It seems to be a case of 
the hour and the man, for " Roderick Taliaferro " 
is a novel of absorbing interest, and for the first 
time gives us a satisfactory romantic treatment of 
the American imperial experiment of Maximilian 
and Napoleon. In reading it, of course, our sym- 
pathies must be all on the wrong side, for not only 
is the hero an unreconciled Confederate officer, filled 
with bitterness at the recent collapse of the slave- 
ocracy, but the whole treatment of the Mexican 
theme is such as to make us share the hopes of the 
imperialists and to mourn with them in their down- 
fall. In this respect the book reminds us of the 
many romances of Stuart intrigue and invasion, 
which force the heart of the reader to be at war 



with the head. But if we can forget our principles 
for the nonce, we shall be well rewarded by Mr. 
Cook's striking story. The hero is rather too much 
of a dare-devil to be convincing, and his love-making 
is somewhat too luscious for our Anglo-Saxon taste, 
but the swift action of the work, its abundance of 
exciting episodes, and its underlying fund of knowl- 
edge concerning the scenes and characters depicted, 
are qualities that go far to atone for a few rather 
obvious defects. The character of Maximilian, in 
particular, is finely studied, and presented with 
close fidelity to historical fact. 

We are always sure of entertainment in a his- 
torical novel by Mr. Joseph Altsheler. He has an 
eye for the picturesque phases of American history, 
and much skill in the construction of a plot. We do 
not expect any marked degree of literary quality, but 
we can count upon stirring action which verges upon 
melodrama, and a generous infusion of sentimental 
interest. In "Before the Dawn" he has taken the 
last period of the Civil War for his subject, and 
made the capital of the Confederacy the scene 
about which the story centres. The fighting in the 
Wilderness is vigorously described in a series of 
chapters, and the capture of Richmond occupies the 
closing scene. We have for hero and heroine the 
conventional figures — in this case a Southern sol- 
dier and a young woman of Northern sympathies. 
She comes to Richmond, is suspected of being a 
Union spy, escapes with the connivance of her lover, 
figures as a ministering angel on the field of battle, 
and returns to join her lover at the end. Her orig- 
inal presence and purpose in the camp of the enemy 
are enveloped in mystery, and here is the one note- 
worthy defect of the novel. We have a right to 
expect a striking solution of a mystery thus heralded, 
and we get what is practically no explanation at all. 
The fact seems to be that she is brought to Rich- 
mond simply because the author had to have such 
a heroine in that place. We are certainly glad 
to have her there, but we should also be glad to 
have her advent accounted for in some rational 
manner, 

Another Civil War story of the conventional sort 
is Mr. Cyrus Townsend Brady's "The Southerners." 
The only thing we miss in this case is the custom- 
ary Northern hero. It is true that the hero is an 
officer in the United States navy, which gives us 
the necessary antagonism that love reconciles in 
the end, but the situation is rather weakened by the 
fact that he is a son of Alabama, and that the hero- 
ine has been his sweetheart from childhood. The 
story is naval rather than military, and reaches its 
climax in Farragut's exploit at Mobile. There 
are several chapters of bare history unmixed with 
romance which the reader will do well to skip al- 
together. The book again exemplifies the combi- 
nation of manliness and sentiment which character- 
izes Mr. Brady's other stories. 

The success obtained by Miss Liljencrantz with her 
book of last year, " The Thrall of Leif the Lucky," 
has encouraged her to renewed efforts in a similar

field. At about the time when one Nor»eman 
discoTering a new world, another was reconquering 
for the Danes the island kiogdom of Britain. The 
greatest man of the brief dynasty which he estab- 
lished, whose name we commonly spell Canate, is 
the central figare of this new romance, which is at 
least the eqaal of its predecessor in grasp of its sab- 
jeet, and in the skill with which the bare statements 
of fact foand in the old chronicles are adorned with 
romantic and vital interest. ■■ The Ward of King 
Canate " is the title of this really charming work of 
historical fiction. The ward is a Danish maiden, 
and her lover is a noble Angle who rescues her from 
peril, and whom she in tarn afterwards befriends in 
an effective way. Bat Canate is, after all, the dom- 
inant figare of the book, which deals particularly 
with his strife against Edmund Ironsides and his 
eventaal peaceful occap»ation of the kingdom. He 
is made the subject of a fine character-study, and 
we witness the development in him of those qual- 
ities which made him so great a man in after life. 
The colored illustrations by Mr. and Mrs. Kinney 
help not a little to make this book one of the most 
attractive of the year. 

In " The Triumph of Count Ostermann," 
" Graham Hope " ( whom we understand to be a 
lady ) has done something more than to construct an 
historical romance pure and simple. She has given 
OS a really vivid and at the same time conscientious 
sketch of the last years of Peter the Great, and of 
the slow upbuilding of the Western capital which 
forever remains as the memorial of his genius. The 
••mi-barbaric life of the time is pictured with much 
skiU, and the manners of a corrupt and brutal eonrt 
are unsparingly described. The German minister 
of Peter is, as the title indicates, the hero of the 
work, and his triumph is twofold : first, it is the 
triumph, almost until the end, of personal integrity 
and far-seeing statesmanship over the forces of in- 
trigne and deceit ; second, it is the triumph of the 
man in his private capacity over the young princess 
to whom he is wedded by royal command, but who 
despises him for his p>easant origin, and only after 
a long struggle with herself comes to recognize his 
nobility of character and to share with him her 
fullest sympathies. The scope of the tale carries 
us far beyond the death of Peter, and shows us how 
the minister holds his owni until treachery undoes 
faim, and he is setting out for his Siberian exile, 
accompanied by the wife who has now learned to 
recognize his worth. 

The Puritan Revolution in England has been a 
good deal overworked by recent novelists, bat the 
list of Cromwellian romances stiU has room for as 
g^ood a book as Miss McChesney's " Cornet Strong 
of Ireton's Horse." The author has already won 
a considerable degree of success in dealing with 
this period of English history, and her work has 
a foundation of solid historical information. The 
main feature of her present plot is one that strains 
onr credulity, to say the least. Cornet Strong is rep- 
resented as a Puritan soldier of the fanatical type, 



a hard rider and a doaghty warrior, yet in the end 
he turns out to be a woman in disguise, and the 
mother of the young ofScer who is the conventional 
hero. Aside from this feature the plot is of the 
hackneyed sort. The heroine is a royalist maiden, 
haughty and irreconcilable, but finally so sub- 
dued by her love that she weds the hero in spite 
of the fact that duty has compelled him to order 
the execution of her brother, caught acting as a 
royalist spy. This contravention of the osual can- 
ons of romantic fiction is rather startling, bat the 
author meets the difficulty boldly, and almost over- 
comes it. Miss McChesney has caught the spirit 
of her period with marked success, and her narra- 
tive is skilfally handled. 

It is romance of a quite different species that 
meets as in '■ The House on the Hudson," by Mias 
Frances Powell, who appears to be a new writer. 
The book may be described as a blend of >' Jane 
Eyre " with the sort of melodramatic fiction that 
enthralled our youthful interest in the days when 
the "New York Weekly" had power to charm. 
Such a heroine we have not encoaatered for many 
years. Her name is Athena, she is divinely beaa- 
tif al, speaks half a dozen langoages, and is an adept 
in most of the manly sports. When she lays ont 
the athletic hero with a single calculated thump, our 
admiration knows no bounds. For those who like 
bighly-spieed sensationalism in their fiction, this book 
is not likely to find any competitors among recent 
novels. It is high-fiown in both diction and imag^ 
nation, and has enough of literary quality to lift it 
fairly above the level of the ordinary ''shocker." 

The stories of Mr. and Mrs. Egerton Castle are not 
merely romantic in constraction and incident ; they 
are also romantic in atmosphere, which is a great 
deal more important. '* The Star Dreamer " repeata 
the sueeesB of " The Light of Scarthey," a statement 
which is equivalent to high praise, indeed, and as 
an example of conoatently romantic fiction would be 
hard to match among present-day productions, out- 
side of the other work of the gifted authors. It is 
a work of rich and glowing beaaty of style, offer- 
ing much variety of scene and character, and based 
up>on a plot which moves slowly at first, but which 
toward the end attains a momentum that leaves as 
fairly breathless. The scene is an ancient English 
castle, and the time about a handred years ago. We 
can g^aarantee the fortunate readers of this book a 
season of unalloyed enjoyment in communion with 
the lovely scenes which it depicts and the noble souls 
which it portrays. Such a book as this is indeed 
an oasis in the dreary waste of onr carrent fiction. 

• The Gold Wolf," by Mr. Max Pemberton, is 
also romance of a sort, bat it is modem, nervous, 
melodramatic, and crude in its coloring. It aboonds 
in glaring improbabilities, and it is continually rais- 
ing interesting points that are left half-explained or 
not at all. Cheap, sensational devices are the writ- 
er's main reliance, and the imaginative touch of 
certain of his earlier romances is almost wholly miss- 
ing. A man of many millions, almost driven to

insanity by the high tension of a life spent in mani- 
pulating the stock market, does not make a partic- 
ularly sympathetic sort of hero, and there is no 
heroine worth mentioning. Mr. Pemberton has 
written better books than this, and we hope that 
he may write more of them. 

"The Traitors," by Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim, 
is a romance of the hackneyed " Zenda " sort, but 
sufficiently vigorous and well-planned to make its 
existence justifiable. The scene is the kingdom of 
Theos, which is conveniently situated in the Bal- 
kans, and is the object of brutal Turkish assault and 
perfidious Russian diplomacy. English power is the 
DeMS ex machina which saves it from destruction 
when sore beset by its foes. This is brought about 
by a clever newspaper correspondent. The King 
is a fine fellow who has won his spurs in the En- 
glish army, and the woman who becomes his queen 
is the daughter of an American millionaire. In this 
respect the story is much happier than its "Zenda" 

The English novelist who selects a Spanish back- 
ground for the scenic investiture of his work is not, 
as a rule, distinguished by his knowledge of Span- 
ish life. He is generally content to give us the con- 
ventional stage properties, the stock situations, and 
the hackneyed turns of phrase, that stand for Spain 
in the book-fed imaginations of most readers, and 
trusts to the spirit of romance to do the rest. Not 
so Mr. Paul Gwynne, the author of "The Pagan at 
the Shrine." One may almost complain of him that 
he knows Spain too well, for his book is so freighted 
with folk-lore and local custom, and the sort of 
detail that means intimate acquaintance with the 
homely life of the people, that the story itself suffers 
from the richness of its setting. The extraneous 
matter which thus loads it down is so extraordinarily 
interesting that we are loth to indulge in even so 
slight an adverse criticism as is above implied, but 
the fact remains that the plot is now and then a bit 
difficult to follow. In its main outline the story is 
simple enough. A young Jesuit brother commits a 
mortal sin, and keeps it a secret. All the rest of 
his life is one long expiation, but the consequences 
of the sin return to plague him, and bring the mat- 
ter to tragic issue in the end. His natural son is 
slain through a horrible misunderstanding, and the 
unhappy father falls dead in the very hour of bis 
long-delayed public confession. This novel is one of 
the most remarkable of the season, for it is one of the 
rare books that, in the guise of fiction, are genuine 
revelations of human life under exceptionally inter- 
esting conditions. William Morton Payne.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



" The Mannerings" (Houghton), latest of Miss Alice 
Brown's works of fiction, is a true novel and one far 
above the average of the books poured out upon the 
reading world with such profusion. It deals with the 
narrow life of some well-bred people in New England, 
and with some characters not so well bred, suggesting 
provincialism on every page. There are more princi- 
pal characters than will ordinarily be found in a work 
devoted to portraying the development of character, 
and Miss Brown's skill leaves no one of them on 
quite the same ground at the close of the book that 
he occupied at the beginning. A question in literary 
casuistry is raised which bids fair to dominate the situ- 
ations as a whole, but it is fortunately permitted to oc- 
cupy no undue space. Were Miss Brown to enlarge her 
sphere of action, she would stand almost alone among 
the women novelists of the country; she has, in fact, 
outgrown New England already to an extent of which 
she does not seem to be aware. 

Mr. Henry James shows a return to his older — and 
better — manner in his latest volume, "The Better 
Sort" (Scribner). It is a collection of short stories, 
most of which have appeared in magazines during the 
last few years, and all dealing with men and women 
whose position in society seems to have given name to 
the book. The characters show the subtlety of analysis 
which has long been Mr. James's peculiar province to 
exploit in literature, hut they lack in good part the in- 
volution of thought and phrase which has bewildered so 
many readers who have not followed his career from its 
beginnings. As usual in his recent work, Mr. James 
finds the background for most of the stories in London; 
hut his knowledge of America and its people enables 
him to introduce his countrymen and countrywomen at 
will, whenever he needs a character not quite in unison 
with the highly civilized circle whose home centres in 
the metropolis. Because of its greater simplicity of 
style and treatment, the book may be recommended to 
a larger circle than anything written by Mr. James in 
the last five years, with the certainty of not disappoint- 
ing its constituents. 

A variant of the " Enoch Arden " theme forms the 
basis for Mr. John H. Whitson's " Barbara, a Woman 
of the West " (Little, Brown, & Co.), with the scene 
ranging from a Kansas ranch, through the mining 
regions of Colorado, to the pleasant climate and out- 
of-door life of Southern California. The husband, a 
selfish fellow with artistic tastes, leaves his wife when 
bitten by the prospecting fever, and suffers injuries that 
destroy his sense of identity and in the end his life, leav- 
ing Barbara to support herself as best she can. She 
enters the newspaper world, and develops marked qual- 
ifications for her work; but when she receives word of 
her lost spouse she gives that up and is thrown into al- 
most daily contact with the man she afterwards marries. 
The proof of her husband's death is soon overthrown, 
but he has the grace to expire in her arms, and she is 
re-married to the man she loves. This bald statement 
does little justice to the real merit of the work, which 
makes a more than ordinarily careful discrimination 
between Barbara's various environments, introducing 
numbers of typical characters. 

Nothing could be more welcome than the substitution 
of the speech of a man imbued with the language of 
Shakespeare for the ordinary dialect of the American 
countryman, which Mr. Irving Bacheller has effected

in his newest and best novel, '■ Darrel of tbe Bleased 
Islea " (Lotlirop). If Mr. Mnnkittriek'B sonl exploding 
*■ io one great b'gosk ! " had aajthiag to do with the 
change from the manner of " Eben Holden," he deserves 
the thanks of the reading commnnitj. The character 
that tbe title commemorates is an Irishman, widelj

There is an idvllism of treatment that argues a Tastly 
greater and better literarr future for Mr. BaebeQer 
than could be inferred from his two books preceding, 
and it is rather wonderful that they succeeded so thor- 
onghlr in obscuring tbe really delightful scholarship 
here shared with the world for tbe first time in the 
form of fiction, though long known to the authcw** 
friends and acquaintance. 

" Life's Common War " (Barnes) is tMi oat of the 
eoaamon way in its settings and characters, though we 
fiad hwe the griefs and sorrows that come to all, as weQ 
as many things that most of us, happily or unhappily, 
can never have. The heroine of the storv (it is markedly 
deroid of masculine heroic material) is Drsnla Keith, an 
inphiarid girl of wealth and poHtion in Boatoii. In tbe 
earlier pages especially, she is as bright and cheerful a 
figure as one can hope to read about, and the charae- 
tetnatians of her friends and aoqnaintaaeesare both hn- 
moroas and vivid, — as where we are introdaeed to the 
sort of person of whom tbe author, Mrs. Annie Eliot 
Trumbull, says, " Everything always reminded her of 
sooaething quite different." Somewhat to tbe leadst^a 
surprise, tbe narrative dips into a question of easaisUy, 
and one involving the ethics of labor-troubles into the 
bargain. With this is commingled Ursula's marriage 
to the wrong person, her determination to leave him, 
aad her final acceptance of her duty in the premises as 
the final guardian of her husband's integrity. For all 
its lack of definiteness of aim, the book is always inter- 
esting and much of it entertaining. 

Northumberland is the scene of Mr. Ellsworth Law- 
son's story, " From the Unvarying Star " (Maemillan}. 
It tells of the life, in a small English mannfaetaiiag 
town, of a non-conformist paiaoa, in love with tbe daogb- 
ter of his senior elder, the wealthiest man of the ooo- 
gregation. There is conflict with another of the chareh 
I'ff^'f''. endeavor to rescue those in sore trials from 
the eSeets of their own indiscretion, and very little at- 
tempt at the setting forth of dogma. Tbe love story 
is beautifully idyllic, having in it much of the charm 
of Mr. Lawaoo's former work, and the mingling of this 
with tbe melodrama of crime of one sort and another 
gives the book an tmevenness which works to its detri- 
ment. Yet there are evidences of wide reading and a 
love for the best poetry, so that a real literary flavor is 
giren to the book. It is to be said that the general 
impression of tbe work is one of promise rather than 
fulfilment. 

Mr. Cyrus Townsend Brady has gone back to an 
earlier field for the material from which he has cod- 
structed the semi-detached episodes of far Western life 
which make up " The Bishop, Being Some Account of 
his Strange Adventures on the Plains" (Harper). It 
may very well have been Bishop Whipple who serves as 
the central figure, and unquestionably Mr. Brady's own 



life as a iiiiiaiiWMfj ia thos e parts has provided him with 
more than one incident. These are of varied Talnei^ aad 
in some the connection with the prelate in qaeatioa is 
slight, — as when he is called to marry a eoople whose 
ante-marital deeds provide tbe real interest. The fnll 
flavor of a past or paanng time is in tbe work, which 
deserves setting down oo that aeeonnt alone. In addi- 
tion, the writer has an abundaoee of power, and his 
work is never uninteresting. 

" Elizabeth's Children " (John Lane) — tbcM see— 
to be a literary fashicm ia names, and " Filiiahrth * is 
in the height of it, — is from an anonymous hand, bat 
evidently not that of the reeent " visits " and ■■ letten." 
An English bachelor is iadaeed to take-care for a sea- 
son of three little lads, sons of an old flame of his by 
her French husband. The youngsters have a delightful 
time in the English eoantiy bouse of their temporary 
guardian, — a more delightful time by far than they 
allotted to him. They have an alluring dialect of the 
maearoBie sort, aeeounted for by one of them, who ob- 
served " dat Papa almost always speak de English be- 
cause he tink Maman like dat de best, aad Maman 
speak de French to os beeaose she tink Papa like dat de 
best." Long before tbe atoiy has proceeded through 
its course, the reader will have fallen in love with the 
children, and will be grateful for the part they take in 
aiding their boat in his own little romanee. The book 
is distinctly entertaiaiag. 

In Mrs. -\liee Doer Miller's story of " The Modera 
Obstacle " (Seribner), a girl of position and talent in 
the higher circles of New York society falls in love 
with a musician, a charming fellow with an ability that 
runs almost into genius in his art, in which he has her 
entire sympathy. But the commercial agencies would 
rate him as owaiag ao Moce tbaa sixty thoosand dol- 
lars, — and tbia, for ber, mwias poverty or exile. The 
ingenious mnsieiaa, bowever, finds himself soffering 
from a disease that appears boand to take him off ia 
six months, — and as his wealth is deemed aaffieient to 
last out that term, the twain are made one. But he 
does not die at the time set, so goes to Cuba to make 
the now needed fortune. Here he is made the heir of 
a wealthy planter; and the planter first, and the hns- 
band later, die in the most aeeommodatiag '»——■"'- ia 
Older to reward tba lady for bar dintareatedaeH. 
Some diMj^ointaaeat will be felt, by those who know 
the andMic'a piiisas. that so little poetry should appear 
in tbe conception and execution of the story; but it is 
not one in which tender sentiment finds much place. 

Mr. B. K. Benson's fourth book, *■ Old Squire, the 
Romance of a Black Virginian " (Macmillan}, is a sequel 
to the work jast preeeding it, in the aeaae ii aai^ tba 
Morgaa twins again as the central ^ares of tba aaic^ 
dvs, though the old slave from whom tbe book ia aaawd 
is really its protagonist. As in all the [iii i iiiiw iiilain 
from this hand, the account is closely historieal, its data 
obtained from authentic sources, and its eoneem with 
the Civil War. Tbe mystery which has characterized 
its predecessors is wanting here, tbe utilization of the 
Morgan twins supplying this element afresh. As in the 
former works, the events of the war are fully realized 
and most interestingly interwoven with the fictional 
characters. The old slave, as we are told by the author's 
note, is an historic peraonaga, at least in the latter part 
of the story, which haa abaadant romanee to endear it 
to that mysterious pwra o aiiit y, the average reader.

year or two ago. Like its predecessor, tlie newer work 
is a " mystery " story, beginning with a cold-blooded 
murder and ending with another murder and a suicide, 
the interval being filled with love-making and a more or 
less interesting case of suspended individuality. To the 
hardened reader of this sort of story, the "mystery " is 
at no time very deeply mysterious; but to the novice it 
will probably contain enough of the element of suspense 
to keep him interested from cover to cover. The scene 
is in the mining regions of the West; there is a long-lost 
father, a Mexican bandit, a wronged wife, and enough 
of the usual apparatus of this form of reading matter 
to make it worthy of perusal during the coming heated 
term. 

Good old melodramatic romance is to be found in 
"The Spoils of Empire" (Little, Brown, & Co.), the 
work of Mr. Francis Newton Thorpe. The story has 
to do with the expedition of Cortfes, the overthrow of 
the Aztec empire, the Spanish Inquisition, and a num- 
ber of kindred topics, treated in a manner curiously 
reminiscent of the days of Ainsworth and James. The 
Mexico is that of Prescott rather than of Fiske, and 
there is no apparent disposition to make the Aztecs the 
inferiors of the Spaniards in any essential, — much as in 
General Lew Wallace's " The Fair God." It would be 
idle to say that a story so replete with striking situations, 
conspiracies, battles, sudden death, and religious strug- 
gles, is lacking in interest; and those who have not yet 
advanced beyond an enjoyment of Bulwer-Lytton at his 
noisiest will like Mr. Thorpe's work to the full. 

Between Mr. Churchill Williams's " The Captain " 
(Lothrop), which follows the fortunes of Grant as far 
as the fall of Vicksburg, and Mr. Winston Churchill's 
" The Crisis," which occupies itself largely with the 
same remarkable figure, there is likely to be confusion 
in the reader's mind. Mr. Williams shows Grant in 
his early days in Missouri, after he had left the army 
for the first time, follows his fortunes to Galena and 
Springfield, and thence on through the siege of Vicks- 
burg. His hero is a young Missourian who opens a 
law-office in Galena, enlists in Grant's own regiment, 
and becomes a member of his staff. There is a free 
use of historical persons, as of historical anecdotes; and 
though the general tone of the book and the romance it 
embodies is wholly unlike Mr. Churchill's, one still has 
ground for wonder at the temerity, or independence, or 
both, which have gone into the one just now published, 
the popularity of its predecessor being taken into ac- 
count. Mr. Williams's is much the shorter of the two 
— and none the worse on that account, — and it is far 
enough removed from the story of Philadelphia mu- 
nicipal politics, which was his first essay in fiction, to 
permit auspicious augury for his literary future. But 
it would deserve much higher praise had it preceded, 
rather than followed, " The Crisis." 

One may suspect Mr. Edward W. Townsend of a 
really clever satire upon the element in New York which 
calls itself real society, in contradiction to the poodle- 
dinner-givers and their friends among the higher mam- 
malia, in his cleverly written series of letters, " A Sum- 
mer in New York " (Holt). The heroine of these let- 
ters is the daughter of a wealthy Westerner who has 
made his millions in iron, his ancestors having been of 
the first circles of Manhattan, where his sister, fortu- 
nately married, still occupies a leading place. The 
daughter, joint heiress to these millions, comes to the 
city for the first time, and is duly inducted into the 
select life of its most fashionable folk. She there learns 



the higher wisdom at a rate that would be more alarming^ 
if it were less laughworthy, — imbibing, for example, 
such maxims from her aunt's worldly lips as " A man- 
ner of not being quite so good as we are is sometimes 
a safeguard against being mistaken for something not 
nearly so good as we are." Mr. Townsend has no dif- 
ficulty in providing such a girl with suitors, so he sets 
himself the more difficult task of providing her princi- 
pal suitors with life-partners also, and the bright little 
book ends with what might be called a matrimonial orgy. 

Miss Mary E. Wilkins that was, Mrs. Charles Man- 
ning Freeman that is, has produced some really astonish- 
ing results in the way of mysteries in the book of short 
stories which she calls " The Wind in the Rose Bush, 
and Other Tales of the Supernatural" (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.). Without the use of the element of hor- 
ror that characterizes Bulwer-Lytton's " The House and 
the Brain " or the work of Poe in the same field, rely- 
ing rather upon terror, so different a sentiment, she con- 
structs out of the ordinary, commonplace, every-day life 
of New England a number of episodes that will send the 
most hardened to bed with an uneasy glance behind. It 
is inevitably crime, or something closely akin to crime, 
that lies behind her various weirdnesses; but she has 
the wise economy of narration which refuses to disclose 
most of these deeds of shame, and her work may fairly 
be called engrossing. 

" Wee Macgreegor " (Harper) is the pleasant work of 
Mr. James Joy Bell, who seems not to be as well known 
on this side of the Atlantic as his two cheerfully writ- 
ten little books of verse for children warrant. The story 
is made up of a series of episodes in the life of a small 
Glasgow lad, Macgregor Eobinson by name, who with 
his father, a decent mechanic, his mother, a capable 
housewife, his small sister Jeannie, his " Grandpaw " 
Purdie, and several neighbors and their offspring, consti- 
tute the dramatis personal. Macgregor is the common 
or " garden " variety of boy, — no thoroughly equipped 
household is without just such another, — and his joys 
and sorrows will be entered into by affectionately dis- 
posed and sadly worried parents everywhere. Much of 
the delicious humor of the book is due to the lowland 
Scotch dialect affected by the Robinson family, and the 
reader will be grateful for the glossary of terms with 
which the narrative is prefaced. 

Miss Josephine Daskam's " Middle-Aged Love 
Stories " (Scribner) teach that love is no respecter of 
persons who are still unmated, no matter how clearly 
they may regard themselves as committed to an earthly 
celibacy. Her theme requires that there shall be no 
marked disparity of years between the belated couples 
she makes happy, and there will not be lacking those 
who will hold as eminently undesirable the wholesome 
matter-of-fact sort of women she selects for her men, 
and the idling and jaded men she selects for her women. 
This is probably due to the fact that in a large part of 
her narrative Miss Daskam relies upon imagination, 
experience failing. There is a great deal of shrewd 
analysis of motives and character in every one of the 
seven tales of which the book is made up, but there will 
still be wonder whether the general attitude of middle- 
aged women is quite as complaisant as Miss Daskam 
makes it appear, — the "Yes, sir, and thankee too" 
of the old story. 

" Richard Rosny " (Appleton) is an extended story 
of English life among the upper middle class, in which 
the hero appears to be kept in an assortment of miseries 
from the first chapter to the last through one device or 



1908.]

another on the part of his womenfolk. " Maxwell 
Gray " (Miss M. G. Tuttiett) makes her hero an officer 
in the Roral Narj. His mother forces him to qait the 
service, but not until the reader has had time to 
wonder why English authors in general make so little 
use of their naval officers in their fiction. The book is 
earefullj written, contains a number of exciting epi- 
sodes by way of relief to the general sordidness of the 
characters, and really preaches a covert sermon against 
extravagance. 

Tragedy, outgrown and liTcd out into serenity and 
peace, is the note of Miss Eleanor G. Hayden's '■ From 
a Thatched Cottage " (Crowell). It is an unusual story 
in other respects, the results being attained by simple 
means, and the entire volume strewn with description! 
that are fully lyrical in their essence. The scene is 
laid in England, the people are of the lower middle 
class, the time is the present. There is a good deal of 
rural dialect used to give local color, but even this is 
not overdone, and is quite intelligible to the American 
reader. With the rest goes rustic humor, skilfully used 
to relieve the sombreness of the opening chapters, 
which antedate the later by three generations. Miss 
Hayden has the literary gift, and is using it to excel- 
lent advantage. 

Some follies and some downright disagreeable things 
will be found in " The Stumbling Block " (Barnes), by 
Mr. Edwin Pugh, and he has made a tragical ending 
to his book with little warning to his readers, — always 
an error in judgment. Nevertheless the book impresses 
one as having power, both latent and expressed; and it 
is certainly original. The respectable portions of Bo- 
hemia in London provide the character*, after a prologue 
that seems — like the flowers in spring — to have little 
to do with the case. Two women love a single man, 
and this is permitted to end in the death, almost the 
murder, of one of them, and the final taking off of the 
other, though by no means an essentially tragic com- 
plication. That it is treated humorously at the outset 
makes it the more objectionable to those who like well- 
ordered narrative. Still, Mr. Pugh will be heard 
from again, and willingly. 

Astonishingly easy is it to make a living by litera- 
ture in one or another of its forms, — so easy that most 
professional writers who have won their way through 
the usual gauntlet of public indifference and private 
discouragement will be thankful for the improbability 
which attaches to the heroine in Miss Annie Flint's " A 
Girl of Ideas " (Scribner). The heroine is seemingly 
a girl like others, except that she has a collegiate edu- 
cation, an utterly self-devoted girl friend, and a con- 
venient uncle who stands behind as a deva ex mackina 
to help her oot of difficulties otherwise hopeless. But 
"Uncle Tom" is never once appealed to; bis niece 
opens an office in New York, announcing herself as 
ready to sell ideas to writers of every sort. From the 
day she first opens it, there is no further difficulty about 
her living. All sorts of authors flock to her for the 
one great requisite, ideas; and she furnishes them in a 
profusion that will make the most heedless sit up in won- 
der. The one difficulty comes from selling the same 
idea to two individuals, resulting in a charge of pla- 
giarism against the famous one of the two, — and there 
the romance of the story lies. It is a fully modern 
book, and will interest the great and growing army of 
scribblers. 

"D wight Tilton" is the pseudonym adopted by the 
person who writes " On Satan's Mount " (C. M. Clark 



Publishing Co.), a work chiefly concerned with the press- 
ing question of the rich growing richer and the poor 
poorer. Like too many novels with so evident a pur- 
pose behind it, the zeal of the author runs away with 
his sense of proportion, and the reading becomes dull 
where it is intended to be most faaeiaating. A young 
man of Scotch parentage rises to be the confidential 
secretary of the richest man in America. He resigns 
the position when he finds himself expected to crush 
oat all opposition to his employer's will by means legal 
enough, but profoundly immoral in both inception and 
results. He becomes a newspaper man until the papers 
with which he is connected fall under the influence of 
his old employer, whereupon he turns to politics. His 
interest in labor problems calls him into the cabinet of 
the President of the United States, the hard times over- 
spreading the country drive the middle and lower clas- 
ses into revolt, the Senate refuses to act, and just as 
the President takes things into his own hands he is 
killed, and, as all of his cabinet had resigned with the 
exception of the hero, the hero becomes President and 
marries the girl of his choice, the multimillionaire's 
daughter. 

Sacket's Harbor more particnlarly, but northern New 
York in general, give Mr. Olin L. Lyman the material 
from which to construct " The Trail of the Grand Seig- 
neur" (New Amsterdam Book Co.). The French ele- 
ment there persisted through the War of 1812, with the 
incidents of which the rather slender love-story of the 
book is compounded. There is a suggestion of Cooper 
in the Indians who enter into the narrative, there is a 
great deal of " good " fighting, and the story as a 
whole makes a patriotic appeal to Americans. Neces- 
sarily there is melodrama, not the least sensational of 
the characters being a dog who works out the dramatic 
climax for his dying owner. The illostrations are in 
color, not too carefully printed. 

Romances of the war of the Rebellion are still rife, 
though Mr. William Henry Babcock's " Kent Fort 
Manor " (Coates) is far above many such works in im- 
partiality and dignity of treatment. Most of the story 
passes in the spot (a real one) which gives title to the 
book, — a large tract of land not far from Baltimore, 
where Federals and Confederates were more evenly 
balanced in numbers than elsewhere, the region being 
too civilized for the brutalities of border warfare prac- 
ticed farther West, though there is an abundance of 
the horrors of war in the narrative. There is cause for 
congratulation in Mr. Babcock's personal freedom 
from these sentiments as such, or from glorying in 
the wantonness of civil strife ; for the book can be 
read withont rancor on the part of sympathizers with 
the two great bodies of contestants, and with interest 
by aU. 

To believe that an untrained lad, however mosieally 
inclined and however good the instrument given him, 
should be able to play the violin the first time he tries, 
is something of a tax on the imagination ; but that it can 
be done successfully, we have the assurance of Miss 
Harriet Bartnett in "Angelo the Musician" (Godfrey 
A. S. Wieners). The scene changes from San Francisco 
and back again, the interest of the narrative always cen- 
tring about the little Italian boy who grows to a famous 
manhood through the kindness of a man of benevolence 
and wealth. A strong tendency to melodrama manifests 
itself in the later chapters of the book, and there is a 
rather abrupt transition from mosic to politics and 
sociology near its close.

Notes. 

" How to Make School Gardens," a manual for 
teachers and pupils, by Mr. H. D. Hemenway, is a 
text-book published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

Ruskin's " King of the Golden River," edited by 
Miss Katharine Lee Bates, is an addition to the " Can- 
terbury Classics " for children published by Messrs. 
Rand, McNally & Co. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. publish Paul Ford's 
"Janice Meredith" in a "players' edition," with many 
illustrations from the stage, and a colored medallion 
portrait of Washington. 

We have received from Brentano's a new edition of 
Mr. George Moore's early novel, " A Mummer's Wife." 
The volume contains no indication of the fact that it is 
a reprint of an old work. 

The Apocrypha is now being added to the " Temple " 
Bible of the Messrs. Lippincott, and we have before us 
at this moment a volume containing the two books of 
the Maccabees, edited by Mr. W. Fairweather. 

Messrs. Cassell & Co. publish an edition of " White's 
Selborne," edited by Mr. Richard Kearton, which has 
for its distinctive feature a series of more than a 
hundred photographic illustrations taken directly from 
natural objects. 

The April issue of "The Library," an English quar- 
terly devoted to bibliographical and library matters, 
appears in an American edition, bearing the imprint of 
the Scott-Thaw Co., New York. The list of contents 
is unusually attractive, including articles by Dr. Richard 
Garnett and Mr. Andrew Lang. 

The University of Pennsylvania sends us a quarto 
volume of " Results of Observations with the Zenith 
Telescope of the Flower Astronomical Observatory." 
This work, made up wholly of tabulated measurements, 
is prepared by Director Charles L. Doolittle, and rep- 
resents the observations of three years. 

The Chicago Literary Press Bureau, composed of a 
number of writers and newspaper men of this city, has 
recently been formed for the conduct of a general liter- 
ary business, including the purchase and disposal of 
manuscripts, syndicate matter, etc. Mr. Will M. 
Hight, late manager of " The Gentleman's Magazine," 
is in charge of the enterprise. 

" The Art of Living Long," published in Milwaukee 
by Mr. William F. Butler, is a new translation of 
" La Vita Sobria," by the Venetian centenarian, Alvise 
Coruaro. Germane extracts from Addison, Bacon, and 
Temple are added, and a group of essays upon Cornaro 
himself, his family, and his villas. The whole makes a 
curiously interesting volume, and its preparation has 
clearly been a labor of love to the translator and editor. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. have just issued a folder 
giving a sketch of this old Boston publishing house, 
from which it appears that the firm traces its origin back 
to 1784. It is, therefore, the oldest establishment of 
its kind in Boston. Since 1898, when the business of 
Roberts Brothers was acquired, Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. have been publishing more books of fiction, in 
addition to law, and subscription books, and books of a 
miscellaneous nature. 

Recent decennial publications of the University 
of Chicago include the following quarto pamphlets : 
" Oogenesis in Saprolegnia," by Professor Bradley 
Moore Davis ; " The Animal Ecology of the Cold 
Spring Sand Spit," by Professor C. B. Davenport ; 



" On the Beckmann Rearrangement," by Professor 
Julius Stieglitz ; " Practical Sociology in the Service 
of Social Ethics," by Professor Charles Richmond 
Henderson ; " Existence, Meaning, and Reality," by 
Professor A. W. Moore ; " A Sketch of the Linguistic 
Conditions of Chicago," by Professor Carl Darling 
Buck ; " Dimensions of Direct-Current Dynamo- 
Electric Machines," by Mr. Carl Kinsley; and "The 
Finer Structure of the Neurones in the Nervous System 
of the White Rat," by Mr. Shinkishi Hatai. 

" Political Parties and Party Problems in the United 
States " (Putnam), by Professor James Albert Wood- 
burn, is a companion volume to " The American Repub- 
lic and Its Government," by the same author. The 
two books together form a treatment of civil govern- 
ment in this country, both theoretical and historical, 
which is admirably fitted for the use of colleges. In 
fact, the author's declared aim has been to prepare a 
work intermediate between the elementary text-book 
and such comprehensive treatises as those of Mr. Bryce 
and Mr. Ostrogorski. Professor Woodburn is thor- 
oughly acquainted with the history of our party politics, 
and his sympathies are as a rule wisely enlisted. His 
work is deserving of very warm commendation. 

Richard Henry Stoddard, the veteran poet, critic, and 
journalist, died at his home in New York, on the morn- 
ing of May 12, having nearly completed his seventy- 
eighth year. Although a New Englander by birth, he 
became a New Yorker in childhood, and remained one 
to the end of his days. Tailoring, blacksmithing, iron 
moulding, and law office work were among his early 
ventures, before he gained the recognition as a writer 
toward which his ambitions had been drifting from his 
boyhood years. In early manhood he began sending 
contributions in verse and prose to the periodicals, and 
his first volume of poems, called " Footprints," was pub- 
lished in 1849, when he was twenty-four years of age. 
Soon thereafter, he married Elizabeth Barstow, the 
woman of genius who remained his helpmeet until about a 
year ago. A position in the New York Custom House, 
held from 1853 to 1870, gave him a livelihood during 
his most productive literary period. During the last 
ten of these years he was the literary reviewer of the 
" World," and for the last quarter-century he has held 
a similar position with the "Mail and Express." His 
books are many, including juveniles, critical monographs, 
and collections of verse, besides those to which his re- 
lation was editorial. It is as a lyrist that he will be 
chiefly remembered, and his poetical contribution to 
American literature is both considerable and important. 
He has never been a popular poet, in the sense in which 
his famous New England contemporaries were popular, 
but the judicious know his work and esteem it highly. 
The closest of his surviving friends, Mr. Stedman, has 
characterized his poetry as exhibiting "affluence, 
sincere feeling, strength, a manner peculiarly his own, 
very delicate fancy, and, above all, an imagination at 
times exceeded by that of no other American poet." 
Mr. Stoddard's writing was so voluminous, and so much 
of it was mere journalism, that the great bulk of it is 
already consigned to oblivion, but enough of it will live 
to insure the holding of his memory in grateful recollec- 
tion. The anthologist will always resort to his treasury 
for exquisite examples of song, and sometime, perhaps, 
we may have a single volume iu which his best shall be 
garnered for posterity. A volume of literary recollec- 
tions was prepared by him just before his death, and 
will be published during the coming season.

The Macmillan Company 

begs leave to announce the publication of Volumes I. and III. of 

ENGLISH LITERATURE 

AN ILLUSTRATED RECORD 

BY 

RICHARD GARNETT and EDMUND GOSSE 



IN FOUR VOLUMES 
Vol. I. Vol. III. 

TO THE AGE OF HENRY VIII. TO THE AGE OF JOHNSON 

Vol. II. Vol. IV. 

TO THE AGE OF MILTON TO THE AGE OF TENNYSON 

Volumes I. and III. are NOW READY; Volumes II. and IV. will be published In the Autumn. 

Cloth 8vo, each volume $6.00 net, on orders for sets only. 



"THESE four volumes present to the reader an illustrated review of English Literature from the earliest times to 
' the close of the nineteenth century. The authors, who are at once scholars of the highest attainments and mas- 
ters of the art of concise and luminous exposition, have aimed at producing a book that shall stimulate and gratify 
curiosity concerning the great writers of their country and the evolution of its literary history. This " illustrated 
record " will, it is hoped, be welcomed by all who are interested in the study of English Literature as warmly sa the 
illustrated edition of the late John Richard Qreen's well-known work has been by students of English History. A 
consecutive history of the entire course of English Literature from Anglo-Saxon times to our own day will be given in 
one type, so that this, if the reader desires, can be read alone as a narrative of the evolution of English style. In a 
different type, a biography of each author will be supplied, relating in close detail, and with all necessary dates, the 
facts of his life. From the works of each leading writer at least one characteristic quotation will be made in a third 
type, and this will form an anthology of English Literature from the earliest times to our own day. 

Volume I. extends from the Anglo-Saxon period to the days of Tyndale and Coverdale, Surrey and Wyatt ; 
Volume II. deals with Elizabethan and Jacobean writers ; Volume III. conducts the reader from Milton to Johnson 
and Goldsmith ; and Volume IV. brings the record down to our time. The volumes have been lavishly illustrated. 
Many hundreds of cuts, chosen after much laborious research, are inserted in the text ; there are forty full-page pho- 
togravure plates, and thirty plates printed in color. 

An important feature of the first volume is the reproduction of richly illuminated mediaeval manuscripts. The 
chapter devoted to Chaucer has been illustrated with exceptional fulness, and the illustrations to the notice of Caxton 
are of the highest interest. On the subject of miracle plays, ballads, and early Scotch poets and the English Bible, 
much valuable illustrative matter has been collected. 

In the second volume it was, unfortunately, impossible in many instances to give portraits, for the simple reason 
that they do not exist. No portrait is known of Marlowe or Lyly or Peele or Webster or Ford, to name only a few 
distinguished dramatists of the Elizabethan age. But wherever anthentic portraits are known, they have been repro- 
duced. This was the age of fantastically illustrated engraved title-pages, and in both the second and the early part 
of the third volume these have been made a special feature. Facsimiles of autograph letters and MSS. in prose and 
verse have been freely interspersed, nor has topographical illustration been neglected. 

When we reach the age of Milton, in the third volume, there is an embarras de richesse of illustration ; the task 
becomes one of selection rather than collection. Of Milton himself no fewer than six portraits, representing him from 
childhood to his sixty-third year, have been engraved ; and a similar fulness of portraiture has been accorded to Pope, 
Johnson, and others. The early part of the third volume contains numerous engravings after Marshall, Lombart, and 
Faithome ; in the later pages we are among Rowlandson's broad designs and the delicate fancies of Stothard. From 
the time of Sterne and Goldsmith onwards use has occasionally been made of contemporary caricatures. 

In the fourth volume, although the illustrated record may not be so picturesque, yet the abundance and variety of 
the material will be found to have enabled the publishers to render this volume no less attractive than its predecessors. 



A History of English Literature which aims to be scrupulously exact, and yet attractive 
and amusing. With this view before them, the authors of this illustrated record, who have 
given a life-study to the movement and progress of English Literature, have prepared this 
history on entirely new lines.

A SECOND-BATE NOVELIST. 

The amusing Tolume in which Mr. Swin- 
burne has parodied a number of his fellow- 
craftsmen in verse (not forgetting himself in 
the sport) describes the second Lord Lytton 
as " a seventh-rate poet." Mr. Swinburne's 
tendency to exaggerate is well-known, and he 
is probably too severe in this instance, as he is 
undoubtedly too eulogistic in others that might 
be mentioned. But we trust that we do the 
father of this " seventh-rate poet," the first 
Lord Lytton, no injustice in describing him 



as a second-rate novelist. Although for many 
years he vied in popularity with his great con- 
temporaries, Dickens and Thackeray, it was 
hardly claimed for him even during his life- 
time that he belonged to their class, and the 
quarter-century that has elapsed since his death 
has certainly done nothing to enhance his rep- 
utation. In fact, we are inclined to think that 
he has been unduly scorned by the critics of 
these later years, when there have been found 
none so poor to do him reverence, and that he 
is deserving of a better word than is commonly 
spoken in his behalf. 

The weeks just past have found us so oc- 
cupied in celebrating our Emerson centenary 
that sight has been lost, in large measure, of 
the fact that the same year and month marked 
the Bulwer centenary as well. It seems worth 
while, before the occasion has slipped from us 
altogether, to take a glance backward, and to 
ask what can honestly be said about the brill- 
iant English novelist in whom our youth de- 
lighted, and whose name looms so large in the 
literary annals of the mid- Victorian period. 
When Bulwer died, in 1873, it seemed to the 
larger part of the reading public as if one of the 
greatest contemporary figures had passed away. 
The conservative pages of Chambers's " Cyclo- 
paedia of English Literature " offer as the fol- 
lowing surprising statement : 

" The sudden death of Lord Lytton was mnch re- 
gretted. He was at the head of our literature, with 
the single exception of Mr. Carlyle; his worki wet« 
popular orer all Europe, and his fertility and industry 
seemed unabated." 

Between such an opinion as this and the 
opinion now current in critical circles, the 
contrast is striking indeed ; and the present 
underestimate seems to us almost as far re- 
moved from the truth as was the overestimate 
of a generation ago. 

It is easy enough to find flaws in Bulwer 's 
work, and even faults of the most glaring na- 
ture must be allowed. His pretentiousness, his 
affectation of omniscience, and his constant re- 
sort to tricky rhetorical devices, make him an 
easy mark for the microscopic critic. Even the 
critic who concerns himself only with the larger 
aspects of literary art must recognize the fact 
that Bulwer's whole method is artificial, and 
that he rarely achieves either the creation of 



392

[June 16, 



character or the presentatiou of vital truth. 
But when all these perfectly obvious excep- 
tions to his work have been taken, there is still 
a residuum of artistic ability and impressive 
intellectual force that calls for our admiration, 
and makes good his claim to respectable rank 
among the secondary names of our modern lit- 
erature. 

The extraordinary industry of Bulwer is one 
of his most notable characteristics. For over 
fifty years he was a producer of books, and the 
mere list of their titles is imposing. Some of 
the books were poor enough, no doubt ; but 
scattered through the list, both early and late, 
we find works that still hold their place in our 
literature, and still command the interest of 
readers not altogether devoid of the critical 
sense. And his versatility was no less re- 
markable than his industry. That he was lack- 
ing in the originality of the greatest writers, 
must be admitted ; but it must also be admitted 
that few have equalled him in the faculty for 
adapting the manners and the methods of other 
writers without making himself imitative and 
nothing more. A whole series of his earlier 
novels is flavored with Byronism, but they are 
Byronic with a difference. The historical novels 
have learned much from Scott, yet they have 
a distinctive character of their own, which is 
marked by its vices as well as by its virtues. 
In his three central novels of English life, we 
find the influence, now of Sterne, now of Dick- 
ens, now of Thackeray; but the type is com- 
posite, and the ingenious eclecticism of these 
works excites our admiration. In other groups 
of novels, the author was more completely him- 
self, particularly in those tales which have a 
fantastic or supernatural basis, and in those 
which give the freest expression to the deeply- 
felt sentimentalism which was, for good or evil, 
the dominant trait in his composition. 

The works of fiction produced by Bulwer 
number altogether about two dozen titles. We 
may without great difficulty select from this 
list an even dozen of works that fairly represent 
his varied powers, and that deserve to outlive 
at least one more generation. Our list is as 
follows : " Pelham," as typical of his earlier 
satirical and Byronic manner; "Eugene Aram," 
as an example of rhetorical melodrama ; " The 
Last Days of Pompeii," " Rienzi," " The Last 
of the Barons," and " Harold," as the four 
historical romances, not one of which can be 
spared ; " The Caxtons," " My Novel," and 
" What Will He Do with It ? " the most 
typical of the novels proper ; " Zanoni," for 



its characteristic blend of history, romantic 
feeling, and supernaturalism ; " The Parisians" 
and " Kenelm Chillingly," as illustrating his 
peculiar vein of sentimentalism and his ripest 
philosophy. The assiduous reader of the ephe- 
meral fiction now being produced and devoured 
from day to day might do worse than abstain 
for a season from his favorite recreation, and 
devote a few weeks to the reading, or re-reading, 
of the dozen books that have just been named. 
They do not offer the perennial refreshment to 
be got from Scott and Dickens and Thackeray, 
but they do very appreciably dwarf the crea- 
tions of our present-day purveyors of Active 
entertainment, besides affording a considerable 
msight into the history of culture as reflected 
by a singularly acute and sympathetic mind. 

Thus far in this brief summary no word has 
been said of Bulwer's writings in other fields 
than that of fiction. Of his serious prose, there 
is much that is well worth reading, particularly 
his early descriptive papers styled " England 
and the English," his charming essays called 
" Caxtoniana," and his " Athens," a work of 
combined history, philosophy, and literary criti- 
cism, which, while open enough to the attack 
of scholarship, has nevertheless a quality of 
contagious enthusiasm that commends it to all 
generous minds. Bulwer as a poet was less suc- 
cessful than as a writer of prose, and his ambi- 
tious epics and satires fall distinctly under the 
Horatian ban. They are not likely ever again 
to be read for their own sake. Here, however, 
we must except the translations from Schiller, 
which deserve high praise. And here also we 
must make a sort of exception in favor of " The 
Lady of Lyons" and "Richelieu." If we do 
not exactly read these dramas, we may still 
witness their stage performance with a certain 
satisfaction. Generous youth is still thrilled 
by Claude Melnotte's description of the palace 
of his dreams, and the maturer sense finds it 
hard to remain quite unmoved when the hero 
flings down the money in the closing scene, 
and declares, 
" There's not a coin that is not bought and hallow'd 

In the cause of nations with a soldier's blood." 

As for " Richelieu," the play still holds its place 
on the boards, and deserves it. The author no 
more gives us the Richelieu of history than 
Shakespeare gives us the historical Brutus, but 
the piece is none the less effective for that. It 
is stagey in construction and rhetorical in dic- 
tion, but its points are made with an unerring 
dramatic instinct, and its best passages remain 
fixed in our memory whether we like them or 



1903.]

not. And the best of these best passages come 
surprisingly near to being good poetry, — as 
near, on the whole, as the author ever ap- 
proached to that distinction. The poetic lit- 
erature of the nineteenth - century English 
drama is avowedly written for the closet, and 
it is no small achievement to have produced 
the one work of this species that seems likely, 
oat of a whole century's output, to remain a 
valued contribution to the repertory of the 
theatre. 



A NEGLECTED ENGLISH CLASSIC. 



" My brother was born for the benefit of knaves," 
said Charles Wesley, alluding to the rare simplicity 
of John Wesley's nature, a simplicity that made it 
impossible for him not only to tell an antrnth, bat 
ev«n to keep a secret or to practice the slightest dis- 
simulation. It is this tone of absolute simplicity and 
genaineness that gives his Joornal its pecaliar charm. 
This bi-centennial year of Wesley's birth (Jane 17, 
1703) calls attention anew to that little-read and, 
in its unabridged form, somewhat forbidding work 
of literature. To us Americans, the writer should 
be an object of additional interest by reason of his 
early ministry in Georgia and the pnblieation (in 
1737) of his first hymn-book at Charlestown. 

The amazing extent of Wesley's annual travels, 
within the British isles, give to bis recorded obser- 
vations a variety and range that one would by no 
means expect in the diary of a Methodist preacher. 
It is indeed, as Mr. Birrell has said, a book full of 
plots and plays and novels, qaivering with life and 
crammed full of character. To his " never travel- 
ing lees, by sea or land, than 4500 miles a year," 
to his "constantly rising at four for about fifty 
years," and to his " generaUy preaching at five in 
the morning, one of the most healthy exercises in 
the world," he attributed the increasing bodily vigor 
he enjoyed up to almost the very end. It is amus- 
ing to read, in terms that might apply to moral 
delinquency, his censure of the laxity in some of his 
societies about daily morning preaching — at five 
o'clock '. When it is pleaded that *' the people will 
not come — at least, not in the winter," he declares 
the Methodists to be a fallen people, and that " with- 
out early rising neither their souls nor their bodies 
can long remain in health." The above-named min- 
imum of Wesley's yearly travel was nearly always 
largely exceeded, and he made it a rule to preach 
at least nine times a week. Yet with all this ac- 
tivity be found time to keep up, and to publish 
voluminous extracts from, his Journal, and also to 
issue tracts, hymns, letters, sermons, Bible com- 
mentaries, controversial papers, a church history, 
and we know not how much beside. His untiring 
industry excites our admiration, but still more do 
we applaud his courage, moral and physical, as we 



follow the record of it in the simple and modest 
language of the Journal. Beset by an angry mob 
in Staffordshire, he bears unmoved the threatening 
cries of " Bring out the minister ! We will have the 
minister ! " This slender little preacher's power to 
quell such disturbances is illustrated by what fol- 
lowed on this occasion. He writes in his diary : 

" I desired one to take their eaptain bj the hand and bring 
him into the bouse. After a few sentences tntercban^d be- 
tween ns, the lion was become a lamb. I desired him to go 
oat and bring one or two more of the most angry of his com- 
panions. He braoght in two who were ready to swallow the 
ground with rage, bnt in two minat«s they were as calm a> 
he. I then bade them make way that I might go out imnt 
the people. As soon as I was in the midst of them, I eallad 
for a chair, and standing np, asked, ' What do any of yon 
want with me ? ' Some said. ' We want yon to go with as to 
the Justice.' I replied, ' That 1 will, with all my heart.' I 
then spoke a few words which Ood applied ; ao that they cried 
out with might and main, 'The gentleman is an honest gen- 
tleman, and we will spill our blood in his defense.' " 

The sustaining power of high ideals and a lofty 
purpose is nowhere better illustrated than in Wes- 
ley's arduous, eventful, and often perilous career. 
Even the basest could not fail to recognize in him a 
man of God. One rnflSan who bad raised his hand 
to deal him a savage blow, let it fall gently on the 
preacher's head, and, stroking his hair, exclaimed, 
" What soft hair he has ! " The ringleader of a 
mob that threatened to knock out the Methodist's 
brains, had only to hear him pray, and was straight- 
way converted to a better mind. " Sir," he ex- 
claimed, "I will spend my life for you. Follow me, 
and no one shall hurt a hair of your head." So he 
was rescued with the loss merely of one dap of his 
waistcoat and a little skin from one hand. 

His patient endurance, we might almost say hi» 
enjoyment, of physical discomfort of the extremest 
sort, comes out here and there in the Journal in some 
brief and modest mention of bodily hardship. Thus, 
setting out with a friend and a guide from Savannah 
for Cowpen, in late December, he lost his way. The 
three men waded through a cypress swamp, breast 
deep, and were then forced to pass the night in the 
wilderness without food or fire. The ground was 
as wet as their clothes, which, a sharp frost coming 
on, were soon frozen stiff. " However," says Wes- 
ley, " I slept till six in the morning. There fell a 
heavy dew in the night, which covered us over as 
white as snow." The alleged hurtfulness of rains 
and dews in America he calls a vulgar error due to 
" the softness of a genteel education." In the course 
of his travels by boat, he briefly records that one 
night he waked under water, being so fast asleep 
that he did not realize where he was until his mouth 
was full, when he managed to cast off his cloak and 
swim to a place of safety, with no further hurt than 
the wetting of his clothes. Showing the calmest of 
demeanor in the very face of death, he yet bitterly 
upbraids himself for his unwillingness to die. His 
voyage to America was stormy in the extreme, and 
occupied three and one-half months in late fall and 
winter. Of one storm he writes :

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



" About nine the sea broke over ns from stem to stern ; 
burst througb the windows of the state cabin, where three 
or four of ns were, and covered us all over, though a bureau 
sheltered me from the main shock. About eleven I lay down 
in the great cabin, and in a short time fell asleep, though 
Tery uncertain whether I should wake alive, and much 
ashamed of my unwillingness to die. O, how pure in heart 
must be he who would rejoice to appear before God at a 
moment's warning ! " 

And later, he exclaims : 

" 1 who will deliver me from this fear of death ? What 
shall I do ? Where shall I fly from it ? Should I fight against 
it by thinking, or by not thinking of it ? A wise man advised 
me some time since, ' Be still and go on.' Perhaps this is 
best, to look upon it as my cross ; when it comes, to let it 
humble me, and quicken all my good resolutions, especially 
that of praying without ceasing ; and at other times to take 
no thought about it, but quietly to go on ' in the work of the 
Lord.' " 

His bed being drenched by an influx of water, he 
made the discovery that the bare floor served excel- 
lently as a couch, and thereafter believed he should 
not find it necessary " to go to bed (as it is called) 
any more." This equanimity amid all sorts of bod- 
ily discomfort and danger was perhaps one of the 
good results of his mother's careful training of her 
boys " to cry softly." 

Wesley's good-humor under vituperation was ad- 
mirable, even in the earliest years of his ministry. 
One of his Savannah parishioners told him flatly, 
" I like nothing you do," and then gave a list of 
the preacher's supposed misdemeanors, both pri- 
vate and public, concluding with the assertion that 
no one minded a word he said, and that nobody 
would come to hear him. " He was too warm for 
hearing an answer," says Wesley, after setting down 
these grave charges against himself; "so I had 
nothing to do but to thank him for his openness, 
and walk away." 

The turbulence attending Wesley's religious meet- 
ings reminds one of the disorder that so often broke 
up our anti-slavery gatherings. At one time it is 
an ox that the ill-intentioned try to drive into and 
through the open-air assembly of worshippers. But 
the good ox, after turning this way and that in 
manifest reluctance to disturb the meeting, faces 
about and breaks through the company of his driv- 
ers, and so runs away, leaving the Methodists re- 
joicing and praising God. At another time it is 
a shower of stones that endangers the lives of the 
faithful, until the leader of the rioters is brought 
before Wesley, and, struck by something mightier 
than a stone, falls on his knees and implores heav- 
en's forgiveness for his misdoings. Still again, the 
preacher is violently pushed from a wall he has 
mounted, but alights on his feet and delivers an 
expostulation to his tormentors, who thereupon be- 
come milder, and they and the minister part very 
civilly. An attempt is made on another occasion to 
overturn the table that serves him as a platform ; 
and after he has finished speaking many try to 
throw him down ; but he passes through the midst 
and so leaves them. 

That he was a special object of divine protection 



amid countless perils, he firmly believed, as also 
that God again and again intervened to revive his 
flagging energies when bodily weakness and fatigue 
seemed to make preaching impossible. He delights 
to record strange and, to him, marvellous events in 
connection with his preaching. " An odd circum- 
stance," he writes, " occurred during the morning 
preaching. It was well only serious persons were 
present. An ass walked gravely in at the gate, 
came up to the door of the house, lifted up his 
head, and stood stock-still, in a posture of deep at- 
tention. Might not ' the dumb beast reprove ' many 
who have far less decency, and not much more un- 
derstanding ? " His credulity in certain matters 
amounted to superstition. Not only did he believe 
in witchcraft, but he deeply regretted the dying out 
of this belief in others. " The English in general," 
he says, " and indeed most of the men of learning 
in Europe, have given up all accounts of witches 
and apparitions. I am sorry for it; and I will- 
ingly take this opportunity of entering my solemn 
protest against the violent compliment which so 
many that believe in the Bible pay to those that 
do not believe in it." 

It is pleasant to read of Wesley's and Johnson's 
appreciation of each other's worth. "That great 
man " is the preacher's designation of his illustrious 
contemporary. They were each acute and skilful 
in discourse, and this point of similarity it may have 
been that reconciled them to each other's less con- 
genial qualities; for two men more unlike in genius 
could hardly be imagined. We may remark inci- 
dentally a common disapproval of certain attributes 
of the Scotch character. Wesley writes of a meet- 
ing held by him in Dundee : " Poor and rich at- 
tended. Indeed, there is seldom fear of wanting a 
congregation in Scotland. But the misfortune is, 
they know everything : so they learn nothing." In 
illustration of Wesley's aptness of retort in argu- 
ment, we have his record of a good churchman's 
coming to him with an exhortation not to leave the 
established church, and not to use extemporary 
prayer, which the churchman demonstrated to be 
no prayer at all. " For you cannot do two things 
at once. But thinking how to pray, and praying, 
are two things. Ergo, you cannot both think and 
pray at once." To which the other's fitting re- 
joinder was : " Now may it not be proved by the 
self-same demonstration, that praying by a form is 
no prayer at all ? You cannot do two things at once. 
But reading and praying are two things. Ergo, you 
cannot both read and pray at once. Q. E. D." 

The chief charm of Wesley's Journal lying in its 
style, let us go to his own writings for a description 
of it. He writes to a young friend : 

" What is it that constitutes a good style 1 Perspicuity, 
purity, propriety, strength, and easiness joined together. . . 
As for me, I never think of my style at all, but just set down 
the words that come first. . . Clearness, in particular, is neces- 
sary for you and me, because we are to instruct people of the 
lowest understanding. We should constantly use the most 
common, little, easy words (so they are pure and proper) 
which our language affords. When I had been a member of

the UnirersitT aboat ten jears, I wrote and talked mach as 
yon do now. Bnt when I talked to plain people in the castle 
or the tows I obserTed they gaped and stared. This qnickly 
obliged me to alter my style, and adopt the language of those 
I spoke to. And yet there is a dignity in this simplicity, 
which is not disagreeable to thoae of the highest rank." 

In a word, then, it is the childlike qaality in 
Wesley that attracts — the qaality mthoat which, 
we are taaght, one cannot enter into the kingdom of 
heaven. His Joarnal breathes an artless enthasiasm 
that is in striking contrast with the smug self-com- 
placency of eighteenth-century literature as we have 
elsewhere learned to know it. Wesley takes ns out 
among the common people and shows us what they 
are doing and thinking and suffering. Finally, we 
cannot do better than to nrge, with Edward Fitz- 
Grerald : " If yon don't know it [the Journal], do 
know it ... It is remarkable to read pure, unaf- 
fected, undying English, while Addison and John- 
son are tainted with a style which all the world 
imitated." The following of this wholesome advice 
has recently been rendered easier for us by the publi- 
cation of a good and inexpensive abridgment of the

A Ke-discovered Poet.« 



A new poet is always wonderful, but a poet 
lost these two hundred and fifty years, now 
re-discovered and found to have spoken words 
vivid and warm with meaning for our genera- 
tion, — this is more wonderful still. Yet this 
is what has been given us to behold in the 
stately and artfully antique-appearing volume 
in which Mr. Bertram Dobell and his friends 
have set forth the poetical works of Thomas 
Traherne. To the short list of mid-seventeenth 
century lyrists, — Vaughan, Herbert, Crashaw, 
— must now be added the name of this other 
poet of the gentle life. 

And what a pretty book-lover's romance is 
the story of the finding and identification of 
this poet's work ! In the winter of 1896, Mr. 
W. T. Brooks found the manuscript on a book- 
stall, that last resting-place of dead thought 
before the absolute oblivion of the waste-paper 
mills. They were communicated to the late Dr. 
Grosart, who concluded that they were poems 
of Henry Vaughan, and prepared for the press 
an edition of Vaughan to include the new- 
found treasures. Dr. Grosart died before this 
was published. From his library they passed

finally to Mr. Dobell. He came to doabt 
Vaughan's authorship on account of the ever- 
present quality of " passionate fervour of 
thought and intense ardour of enthusiasm" in 
the new poems. Then began a run of expert 
editing and lucky coincidences through the 
treasure-house of the British Museum library, 
unearthing certain proofs of the authorship. 

The ascertained facts concerning Traherne's 
life are few. He was born seemingly of Welsh 
ancestry, in 1636 or "37, in Hereford or Led- 
bury, England. His father was a shoe-maker 
and of poor estate, though other branches of 
the family seem to have been more prosperous. 
The poet was educated at Brasenose College, 
Oxford, receiving his Bachelor's degree in 
1656, Master's in 1661, and that of Bachelor 
of Divinity in 1669. He became an ardent 
minister and defender of the Church of En- 
gland, was rector of Credenbill, and finally was 
brought to London as chaplain to Sir Orlando 
Bridgman, Lord Keeper of the Seals (1667). 
In his patron's house at Teddington the poet 
died, October, 1674, and was buried under the 
reading-desk in Teddington church. 

Traherne published, in 1673, "Soman For- 
geries," an attack upon alleged errors of the 
Roman Church, exhibiting wide knowledge of 
church antiquities and of the writings of the 
Fathers. The year after his death, friends 
published his " Christian Ethicks," a notable 
volume of most modern and unconventional 
thinking. In 1699 the Rev. George Hickes 
sent to the press a little book of devotions by 
Traherne, called " A Serious and Pathetical 
Contemplation of the Mercies of God." It is 
an interesting mingling of quotations, para- 
phrases, and imitations of the Psalms, but with 
many modern images and specifications and 
long lists of individual items and examples 
of things and acts for which he gives thanks. 
The MSS. in Mr. Dobell's hands consist of the 
poems here published and a remarkable book 
of essays called " Centuries of Meditations," 
which the editor promises to bring out. We 
may anticipate this eagerly when we read the 
following as an example of its worth. (He is 
describing his feelings, as a child, about the 
world.)

with ecstacy, they were such strange and wonderful 
things. The Men! O what venerable and reverend 
creatures did the aged seem! Immortal cherubim! 
And young men glittering and sparkling angels, and 
maids strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty! Boys 
and girls tumbling in the street were moving jewels: 
I knew not that they were born or should die." 

A third volume contains the poet's "private 
religious meditations, devotions, and prayers." 
Mr. Dobell conjectures that we have not more 
than half of Traherne's poems, and offers us a 
slight hope that the remainder will some day 
be found. 

Traherne is a religious lyric poet, who in 
the iron age of religious controversy and bit- 
terness kept open a spring of clear and limpid 
expression of universal, kindly piety. In him 
we seem to have that rarest and most precious 
combination — passionate religious emotion 
with the genuine artistry of song. In subject 
matter he most nearly resembles Herbert, and 
in style the more vigorous work of Cowley, 
while with these others he continues the poetic 
traditions of Donne. His limitations are many 
and pronounced, and he shows the inevitable 
faults of all religious verse — few themes, the 
tiresome use of abstractions and general ideas, 
dogmatic mysticism, constant exclamations 
without added imagery or subtle analysis. 
But his expression is astonishingly free, spon- 
taneous, natural ; we have no conceits, and the 
collocations due to verse are obvious and not 
wearisome. 

Perhaps the most immediate surprises in 
Traherne are his striking anticipations of 
Blake and Wordsworth in his portrayals 
of the feelings of little children over the 
glorious earth they inherit, and of Whitman 
in his poetic catalogues and his delight in the 
brave goings-on of the worlds of men and na- 
ture. 

In his " Christian Ethicks " Traherne says 
that others will point out the duty and the ex- 
pediency of obeying God's laws and revering 
His universe, but that he will undertake to 
show how beautiful it all is, how full of joy is 
life lived in religious faith. His entire poetry 
is a specific enlargement upon this theme, but 
full of imagery based upon observation of life's 
rich detail, and of psychology derived not so 
much from religious philosophy and ancient 
Hebrew thought as from religious feeling aris- 
ing in the presence of the actual world of men 
and things. 

It is difficult to quote enough from the 
longer religious poems to give a fair view of 
them, but their tenor may be seen in this sum- 



mary from the " Serious and Pathetical Con- 
templation " (1699) : 

" I give thee thanks for the beauty of colours, for 
the harmony of sounds, for the pleasantness of odors, 
for the sweetness of meats, for the warmth and soft- 
ness of our raiments, and for all my five senses, and all 
the pores of my body, so curiously made as before 
recited, and for the preservation as well as use of my 
limbs and senses, in keeping me from precipices, frac- 
tures, and dislocations in my body, from a distracted, 
discomposed, confused, discontented spirit." 

On account of this primary religious con- 
viction, Traherne loves this earthly life, pas- 
sionately and entire, — his body, the goodly 
earth, life's activities, especially the common 
ways of men. He sees no ugliness in it except 
what is made by man's choice of evil. 

" A disentangled and a naked sense 
A mind that 's unpossest, 
A disengaged breast. 
An empty and a quick intelligence 

Acquainted with the golden mean, 
An even spirit pure and serene. 

Is that where beauty, excellence, 
And pleasure keep their court of residence: 

My soul retire. 
Get free, and so thou shalt even all admire." 

The Preparation. 

In " The Vision," he exclaims : 

" Even trades themselves seen in celestial light. 
And cares and sins and woes are bright." 

Wordsworth said that the senses in their 
purity " own an intellectual charm." See this 
interesting anticipation : 

" and every sense 
Was in me like to some intelligence." Nature. 

How modern seem words like these from 
" The Demonstration ": 

"Nothing's truly seen that's mean: 
Be it a sand, an acorn, or a bean. 

It must be clothed with endless glory, 

Before its perfect story 

(Be the spirit ne'er so clear) 

Can in its causes and its ends appear." 

This delight in life may well be seen in the 
following passionate lines from " The Person": 

" Ye sacred limbs, 
A richer blazon I will lay 
On you than first I found: 
That like celestial kings 
Ye might with ornaments of joy 

Be always crown'd. 
A deep vermillion on a red, 
On that a searlet I will lay; 

With gold I'll crown your head. 
Which like the sun shall ray. 
With robes of glory and delight 
I '11 make you bright. 
Mistake me not, I do not mean to bring 

New robes, but to display the Thing: 
Nor paint, nor clothe, nor crown, nor add a ray, 
But glorify by taking all away."

But it is, I think, in his analysis of his 
feelings as a little child and his religious en- 
thusiasm over a child's innocence, its intimate 
understanding of Nature and God, its protec- 
tion from man's sin and care until its impres- 
sions of nature are fixed, that Traherne is at 
his best. It is the subject matter of full half 
of his verse. 

" These little limbs 
These eves and hands which here I find. 
These rosy cheeks wherewith my life begins, 

Where have ye been ? Behind 
What curtain were ye hid so long, 
Where was, in what abyss, my speaking tongue ? 

Such sacred treasures are the limbs of boys, 

In which a soul doth dwell; 
Their organized joints and azure veins 
More wealth include than all the world contains." 

The Salutation. 

" How like an angel came I down ! 
How bright are all things here ! 
When first among his works I did appear, 

O, how their glory me did crown ! 
The world resembled his Eternity 

In which my soul did walk; 
And everything that I did see 
Did with me talk. 

" The streets were paved with golden stones. 
The boys and girls were mine; 
O, how did all their lovely faces shine! 
The sons of men were holy ones. 
In joy and beauty they appeared to me. 
And everything which here I found. 
Which like an angel I did see. 
Adorned the ground." 

Wonder. 

Would not Wordsworth have rejoiced over 
lines like these ? 

■■ I knew not that there was a serpent's sting 
Whose poison shed 
On men, did overspread 
The world: nor did I dream of such a thing 
As sin, in which mankind lay dead. 
They all were brisk and living wights to me, 
Tea, pure and full of immortality." Eden. 

And would not Blake have been glad to own 
this? 

" A joyful sense and purity 
Is all I can remember, 
The very night to me was bright, 

'T was summer in December." Innocence. 

The following lines from " Dumbness " 
might be transferred without change to " The 
Prelude," and would be in harmony with their 
surroundings : 

" Sure man was bom to meditate on things, 
And to contemplate the eternal springs 
Of God and Nature, glory, bliss, and pleasure. 
That life and love might be bis heavenly treasure; 



And therefore speechless made at first, that be 
Might in himself profoundly busied be: 
And not vent out, before he bath ta'en in 
Those antidotes that guard his soul from sin." 

■■ For nothing spoke to me but the fair face 
Of heaven and earth, before myself could speak. 
I then my bliss did, when my silence break." 

" Then did I dwell within a world of light. 
Distinct and separate from all men's sight. 
When I did feel strange thoughts, and such things see 
That were, or seem'd, only reveal'd to me." 

" The first impressions are immortal all." 

I wish I could quote the entire poem " On 
News," whose theme is the participation of the 
child in everything he hears or sees. I have 
room for this only: 

" News from a foreign country came. 
As if my treasure and my wealth lay there 

So much it did my heart inflame! 
'T was wont to call my soul into my ear 
Which thither went to meet 
The approaching sweet. 
And on the threshold stood. 
To entertain the unknown good. 
It hovered there 
As if 't would leave mine ear, 
And was so eager to embrace 
The joyful tidings as they came, 
T would almost leave its dwelling place, 
To entertain that same." 

Mr. Dobell rightly emphasizes Traherne's 
unexpected idealism, — judging him another 
Berkeley before that philosopher's day. One 
certainly starts to read lines so filled with in- 
tuitive ideas as these : 

« My naked simple life was I ; 

That out so strongly shined 
Upon the earth, the sea, the sky. 
It was the substance of my mind; 
The sense itself was I. 
I felt no dross nor matter in my soul, 
No brims nor borders, such as in a bowl 
We see. My essence was Capacity, 
That felt all things; 
The thought that springs 
Therefrom 's itself. It hath no other wings 
To spread abroad, nor eyes to see, 
Nor hands distinct to feel. 
Nor knees to kneel; 
But being simple like the Deity 
In its own centre as a sphere. 
Not shut up here, but everywhere." 

<■ I could not tell 
Whether the things did then 

Themselves appear. 
Which in my spirit truly seem'd to dwell; 
Or whether my conforming mind 
Were not even all that therein shin'd." 

My Spirit. 

From Traherne's "Serious and Pathetical 
Contemplation," Mr. Dobell selects the one

[June 16, 



really good example of similarity to the work 
of Whitman, but this is sufficiently like to 
cause us to wonder. The poet is speaking 
of " the children of my people," " my lovely 
companions ": 

" Do not they adorn and beautify the world, 
And gratify my soul which hateth solitude ! 
Thou, Lord, hast made this servant a sociable crea- 
ture, for which I praise thy name. 
A lover of company, a delighter in equals; 

Replenish the inclination which Thyself hath im- 
planted, 
And give me eyes 

To see the beauty of that life and comfort 
Wherewith those of their actions 
Inspire the nations. 
Their Markets, Tillage, Courts of Judicature, Marriages, 
Feasts and Assemblies, Navies, Armies, Priests and Sab- 
baths, Trades and Business, the voice of the Bridegroom, 
Musical Instruments, the light of Candles, and the 
grinding of Mills, are comfortable, O Lord, let them 
not cease." 

Truly a poet of the gentle life ! He is 
religious, but not dogmatic, not a quietist ; a 
mystic, but given neither to whims nor para- 
doxes. He does not make us worldly-wise, or 
expert in " the sad discussion of sin." But he 
refreshes our dulled sense of the beauty of liv- 
ing, he moves us without exciting our passions 
(as Voltaire said), he makes us respond to 
" the dear love of comrades," and he particu- 
larly makes shine again the beauty in " life's 
familiar face " and in childhood. Like another 
Wordsworth, he is an unobtrusive but sure 
" friend of the wise and teacher of the good." 

I have not done justice to Mr. Dobell's lit- 
erary skill in identifying Traherne's work, 
nor can I overpraise his enthusiastic analysis of 
the poet's merit. One could only wish that his 
Introduction had been freed from the large 
amount of relevant but commonplace critical 
and other personal moralizing. Mr. Dobell has 
undoubtedly done us a real service, and has 
enabled us to add several fine numbers to our 
classic poetic anthology.

The Monarch in England.* 



Probably no relation of an English monarch 
in the present day has so much interest for the 
public as that of the monarch toward ministe- 
rial and parliamentary government. Probably, 
too, there is no point upon which there is so 
much misconception and such a diversity of 
opinion, with much leaning toward the belief

York : The Macmillan Co. 



that the sovereign is a majestic figure-head, 
only nominally exercising functions which are 
actually controlled by the ministerial cabinet. 
For the American readers, at least, of Mr. 
Sidney Lee's life of Queen Victoria, much in- 
terest will hinge upon the light thrown upon 
Victoria in this important relation. English 
reviews of this book have commented with sur- 
prise upon the exceedingly limited influence 
exercised by the Queen on governmental affairs. 
On this side the water, however, the surprise 
will be that in certain directions Victoria did 
actually exercise a powerful personal influence 
by virtue of her rights as monarch, even 
though, as Mr. Lee points out in his con- 
cluding chapter, royal prerogative steadily de- 
clined throughout the course of her reign. 

Victoria entered upon her long reign with 
little apparent thought of the necessity of 
guarding royal prerogative. Her marriage to 
Prince Albert gave her, early in her royal 
career, a counsellor implicitly trusted, whose 
first care was to understand thoroughly the 
constitutional position of his wife, and to insist 
that it should be wholly respected. Royal 
prerogative included the right of consultation 
upon all matters of state, and both the Queen 
and Prince Albert were particularly interested 
in and determined to be consulted upon ques- 
tions of foreign policy. Preliminary to con- 
sultation with the ministers on such matters, 
Victoria had of course to be taken into the 
confidence of the foreign office, and important 
correspondence and despatches had to be laid 
open for her inspection. Such conferences 
and transmission of documents frequently in- 
volved delays sometimes unfortunate, and often 
irritating to the ministers. In the case of 
brusque ministers, like Palmerston, whose re- 
lations with the Queen were never wholly am- 
icable, the delay was sometimes resented, and 
occasionally the knowledge of important mat- 
ters pertaining to foreign affairs was withheld. 
In general, however, the attitude of the min- 
isters upon this question was one of compliance 
to the Queen's request, especially when, as the 
years went on, her experience and wisdom came 
to be thoroughly respected. She was at no time 
exacting nor autocratic in insisting that her 
suggestions be acted upon ; it was merely the 
reiterated insistence upon being consulted, an 
insistence which was really effective. Many in- 
stances might be cited in which her suggested 
change of a phrase, or modification of a prin- 
ciple, had favorable results for English diplo- 
macy, but none is more famous, nor more

interesting to Americans, than the alteration 
in Palmerston's despatch to Washington in the 
Trent affair, in the early days of the Civil War. 
At that time what would have been an offen- 
sive and insulting note was transformed by 
the Queen's suggestion into a dignified asser- 
tion of the rights of British vessels, leaving 
to America the opportunity for a satisfactory 
explanation without national humiliation. 
Whether Victoria's tact prevented war be- 
tween England and America or not, the inci- 
dent justified the Queen's insistence upon the 
right of consultation on all matters of state. 

Another field in which Victoria took a seri- 
ous view of her personal responsibilities was 
in regard to the distribution of Church pat- 
ronage. She emphatically objected to any po- 
litical partisanship in such matters, writing to 
Archbishop Benson in 1890, in regard to the 
appointment of Bishops, " The men to be 
chosen must not be taken with reference to 
satisfying one or the other party in the Church, 
or with reference to any political party, but 
for their real worth. We want people who 
can be firm and conciliatory, else the Church 
cannot be maintained. We want large broad 
yiewa, or the difficulties will be insurmount- 
able." No minister had a greater share of 
the Queen's personal liking than Disraeli ; yet 
when, in 1868, the Archbishopric of Canter- 
bury became vacant, Disraeli found himself 
compelled by the stubborn resistance of the 
Queen to put aside his own preference, and 
consent to the nomination of the Queen's 
choice, Tait, Bishop of London. Other min- 
isters throughout her reign bad the same expe- 
rience, and were forced to yield to the Queen's 
claim to determine arrangements in the Church. 
She received advice from her ministers, but in 
this field did more than criticize and suggest, 
for she emphatically refused it. 

No statement is more commonly made than 
that an English ministry when defeated in the 
HoQse of Commons has two courses open to it : 
to dissolve Parliament and appeal to the coun- 
try, or to resign office ; and that the option rests 
entirely with the ministry. Yet Mr. Lee shows 
us that Victoria repeatedly throughout the early 
part of her reign exercised her personal choice 
in such circumstances. The right to do this 
was brought into notable prominence in 1868, 
when Disraeli, having suffered an adverse vote 
in the Commons, disclaimed any responsibil- 
ity for the Queen's decision, asserting that he 
had given her no advice as to which course she 
should pursue. For this he was blamed by the 



opposition ; but a search for precedent revealed 
that he stood on wholly defensible ground. The 
incident, as Mr. Lee states, " served to bring 
into clearer relief than before the practical 
ascendancy within certain limits, which under 
the constitution a ministerial crisis assured the 
Crown, if its wearer cared to assert it. The 
revelation was in the main to the advantage of 
the prestige of the throne. It confuted the 
constitutional fallacy that the monarch was 
necessarily and invariably an automaton." 

In the same year, 1868, there occurred an 
excellent illustration of the importance and 
power of the monarch as a medium of con- 
ciliation and arbitration between conflicting 
opinions in the two Houses of Parliament. 
Gladstone's bill for the disestablishment of the 
Irish Church was accepted by the Commons, 
but was threatened with rejection by the Lords, 
in which body the Bishops were then unusually 
active. The conflict seemed destined to assume 
the proportions of a constitutional struggle, 
when the Queen, always fearful of the effects of 
such crises, proposed on her personal initiative 
to attempt to effect a compromise. Gladstone 
gladly accepted her intervention, and her per- 
sonal influence with Tait, Bishop of London, 
persuaded him into a conference with Glad- 
stone, with the result that Victoria's sugges- 
tions were adopted and a satisfactory compro- 
mise was agreed upon. This, after great efforts 
and repeated pressure brought to bear by 
the Queen, was finally passed by both Honses 
of Parliament. In 1884 a similar crisis, this 
time concerned with a franchise bill proposing 
a wide extension of the suffrage, was averted 
by the wise intervention of Victoria, who, as 
before, acted without suggestion from her 
ministers. 

These few incidents, chosen from among 
many that might be cited, serve to show in a 
measure the importance and effectiveness 
which, in spite of the great limitations upon 
the exercise of prerogatives, still belong to the 
monarch in England. Mr. Lee's biography is 
less concerned with such incidents, however, 
than with presenting a just and critical narra- 
tive of Victoria in her dual character of queen 
and woman. He emphasizes the perpetual 
English mistrust of the influence of Prince 
Albert, the suspicion that Victoria because of 
her marriage might sacrifice English to petty 
German interests, and the tardy recognition 
of the Princes merits long after his death in 
1861. He surprises us with his proof of the 
essentia] unpopularity of Victoria herself soon

after that date, an unpopularity due to her re- 
pugnance to appearing as the head of the state 
in public functions, while yet sincerely mourn- 
ing her husband. The irritation of the nation 
was constantly manifested by the press in the 
criticisms directed against what seemed an un- 
necessarily prolonged seclusion, and it was not 
until the Jubilee of 1887 that Victoria re- 
gained that public affection which had been 
lavished upon her in the first years of her reign. 
In every chapter is made clear the Queen's 
constant solicitude for the prestige of her 
country, her dislike of war, yet her determina- 
tion that war once entered upon should not 
terminate until English honor had been satis- 
fied and English interests safeguarded. In- 
deed, her pride in England blinded her at 
times to both the horrors and the justice of war. 
Throughout the story of her life, Mr. Lee is a 
careful, studious, and exact critic, yet a kindly 
one, and eminently fair both to Victoria her- 
self and to the men who advised her. His 
work is an excellent historical biography, in 
every way entertaining and readable.

Besaxt's Eighteenth-Century 

liONDON.* 



Ten years ago or more, Mr. Walter Besant 
(for that was before he received the honors of 
knighthood) wrote a series of nine papers about 
London, which appeared first in a popular 
magazine and afterwards in book form. The 
book was of moderate size, and was obviously 
written with the tastes and fancies of the popu- 
lar mind in view. Nevertheless it was evident 
that its author was deeply interested in Lon- 
don, in its history, and in every phase of its 
profoundly significant life ; and that his knowl- 
edge thereof was not due merely to a familiar- 
ity with the "surveys" and histories that had 
been written from time to time ever since the 
sixteenth century, but was derived from inde- 
pendent excursions into a most attractive field 
of study. 

We now know the nine chapters of a decade 
ago to have been the mere diversion of a writer 
who had greater things in view ; as were also 
his book on Westminster, published in 1895, 
and that on South London, three years later. 
They were of the nature of preliminary 
sketches for a far more ambitious work. The 
widow of Sir Walter tells us that it was her

ter Beaant. Illustrated. New York : The Maemillan Co. 



husband's ambition to be the nineteenth- 
century historian of London, as Stowe was 
that of the sixteenth century. The work by 
which he most desired to be remembered by 
posterity was an early projected complete sur- 
vey of the city. Half his life-time had been 
devoted to active research, and to the collect- 
ing of maps, pictures, pamphlets, account 
books, parish registers, and novels and plays 
of different periods, — of everything, in fact, 
that could throw light upon any phase of Lon- 
don life, — all with his intended magnum opus 
always in view. 

But while Sir Walter had secured the co- 
operation of certain experts in different de- 
partments of city life, he reserved for his own 
pen the general history of the city ; he 
expended on this task five years of continuous 
labor, and happily completed it before his 
lamented death in 1901. From this general 
history, the portion relating to the eigh- 
teenth century, — the period least satisfac- 
torily treated in the volume of ten years ago, — 
has been selected for present publication. The 
result is a quarto of 610 pages, to which are 
added valuable appendices and an admirable 
index. The book is embellished with twenty- 
two full -page illustrations and eighty -one 
printed with the text, — a full score of these 
being portraits, and all of them reproduced 
from contemporary prints. Hogarth has been 
judiciously drawn upon to furnish illustrations, 
and Gay's "Trivia" is frequently quoted in 
the text. A large map of London in 1741-5, 
by John B,ocque, is folded within the cover. 
Although appearing out of season, the book 
has all the sumptuous attractiveness of a holi- 
day book. 

Neither the life of a nation nor that of a 
great city conforms to centuries in the rela- 
tion of its events. The characteristic ideas of 
the eighteenth century, as observed in London, 
really began to manifest themselves with the 
accession of George I. in 1714, and they con- 
tinued until the Georgian era gave place, in 
1837, to the far more glorious Victorian Age. 
Hence Sir Walter's eighteenth century is ex- 
tended to the last named year, — about which 
time, also, the passing of the Reform Bill, the 
beginning of railway travel on land and the 
introduction of steam-ships on the sea, as well 
as changes in the English Constitution, in the 
growth and extension of trade, in religious 
thought and in social standards, ushered in a 
new era, of which we think as often as we 
name the nineteenth century.

It is chiefly of manners and customs, and 
prevalent ideas, which changed but little be- 
tween 1700 and 1837, that Sir Walter Besant 
has written. Of the political changes that 
took place in the city government, he has 
taken but little notice. Under the head of 
" Historical Notes," twenty historical episodes 
of the century and events of English history, 
supposed to belong peculiarly to London and 
to illustrate more particularly the civic spirit, 
have been selected and narrated. These are 
followed by seven chapters in which the topog- 
raphy and external appearance of the city are 
described. A third and fourth division of the 
book are devoted to the relation of the city to 
churches and chapels, and to government and 
trade. The remaining part of the book is de- 
voted to manners and customs, to society and 
amusements, and to crime, police, justice, and 
debtors' prisons. 

To the author of " All Sorts and Conditions 
of Men," the sociological phases presented in 
these later chapters had a peculiar fascination. 
He felt that the power and the unruly condi- 
tion of the London mob, which had steadily 
increased with the population and extent of 
the city, which became absolutely intolerable in 
the eighteenth century and presented the most 
troublesome problem connected with the order 
of the city, was one of the chief characteristics 
of the period. An efficient police was not es- 
tablished until the following century. 

If any fault is to be found with the book, 
it might be because, although the eighteenth 
century was the century of Addison, of Steele, 
of Pope, of Goldsmith, of Johnson, of Walpole, 
and of Sheridan, and was therefore peculiarly a 
century of literary interests, yet those interests 
receive no notice. But if from the author's ex- 
planation that the literature of the eighteenth 
century is reserved for fuller treatment in con- 
nection with that of the centuries before and 
after, we are to imply that other portions of 
Sir Walter's survey will be forthcoming in due 
time, we shall await with patience for a work 
upon London that will be completely satisfying.

Wall Street and its Work.* 



It was just thirty years ago that Walter 
Bagehot published his significant work on 
English trade and finance, entitled " Lombard 
Street." At that time the deposits of known 
banks in London amounted to $600,000,000 ; 
while in New York but one-third of this amount 
rested in the possession of banking houses. 
When Bagehot wrote, every nation went to 
London for loans ; but to-day German bonds 
and English consols are floated in New York. 
While we cannot say that Lombard Street is 
no longer powerful, it is, however, possible to 
declare that Wall Street is a potent factor in 
the finances of the world. A book upon "The 
Work of Wall Street " is therefore welcome, 
even if it does add to the half-score already in 
existence in its general field. 

The book of Bagehot is a classic, broad and 
philosophical. Mr. Pratt's book on Wall 
Street has been hampered somewhat by the 
limitations of the series to which it belongs. 
It has, however, gained in definiteness of 
description something of what it has lost in 
breadth and comprehensiveness. As a re- 
porter, the author has pictured the doings of 
" the Street," and the machinery used in the 
handling of funds and the sales of stocks and 
bonds. The book opens with a chapter on 
" The Evolution of Wall Street," which gives 
evidence of much patient research in books 
and records for elusive facts. Evolution has 
reference to the process of unfolding and the 
principles involved in such a process ; but this 
chapter is given over to a recital of incidents 
more or less connected with the history of Wall 
Street, with the result that the reader gets but 
a hazy notion of the evolution of this great 
financial centre. Beginning with Chapter II., 
however, the author goes forward with more 
certainty of touch, as in clear and incisive lan- 
guage he unwinds the mysteries of " the Street." 

Objection may be taken to the statement 
that the operations of the merchant and the 
speculator are essentially the same. The spec- 
ulator exists to-day because he performs a func- 
tion different from that of the merchant, and 
more particularly from that of the manufac- 
turer. He it is who assumes the risks of fluc- 
tuating prices, and relieves the producing 
agents of the uncertainty of the future. He 
is supposed to relieve both the producer and

consumer from carrying large stocks, by guar- 
anteeing future supplies. As Wall Street deals 
almost exclusively in stocks and bonds, the 
speculator operating there does not affect the 
industrial world in the highly important way 
that the same functionary does when dealing 
in grains, provisions, iron, coal, and other ma- 
terials. Perhaps Mr. Pratt has unconsciously 
put the matter too favorably for the "Wall 
Street " trader, when he says : " A market that 
has uo public is in a most unsatisfactory con- 
dition. Professionals can, and do, buy and sell 
among themselves ; but this is a process not un- 
like the ' swapping ' of horses between regular 
horse-traders. The public supplies the new 
interest in the Street, — the fresh demand, the 
increased capital. We have already seen that 
about one-third of all the transactions repre- 
sents real buying or selling, outside of manip- 
ulation and room-trading. Of this one-third, 
the public interest is decidedly the most im- 
portant." The " Street," after all, has its place 
as a capital accumulator and distributor ; but 
it performs this function together with the 
banks. When it goes beyond this, the stock 
exchange is perilously near the gambling point. 
Mr. Pratt's book deals very briefly with the 
larger function of " the Street," but describes 
admirably the exchange, the clearing-house, 
the money market, panics, and many other fea- 
tures of our American financial centre. In 
fact, it may be said, despite minor criticisms, 
that no other book so well fills this special 



field.

" The Woman Who Toils " is certainly a note- 
worthy book. Two society ladies of New York, 
attired in the manner of the proletariat, set out to 
ascertain by actual experience what sort of life fac- 
tory women led. Mrs. Van Vorst worked in a 
Pittsburg pickle factory ; at Perry, a New York 
mill town ; and at the clothing business in Chicago. 
Mies Van Vorst's experiences were at Lynn, Mas- 
sachusetts, making shoes ; and in the cotton mills 
at Columbia, South Carolina. Both writers tell their

story well, and there is no reason to doubt that the 
vivid and realistic pictures of factory life they pre- 
sent are fair and accurate. It may be suggested 
that these well-educated and well-nurtured women 
could not do justice to a subject so foreign to their 
natures as the life of the factory worker ; but it 
seems to me that in one sense they alone could do 
it justice, for only those who have known the best 
that this world offers can measure understandingly 
the deficiency in the lives of those who have to live 
upon the dregs. As B. L. Stevenson found in his 
experiences as an amateur emigrant, so these ladies 
very soon discovered, that in proletarian clothes they 
were universally regarded as proletarians. Their 
manners did not " give them away," though they 
made no attempt to change them, beyond the use 
of a certain amount of bad grammar. They found 
no fundamental difference between themselves and 
the women they came in contact with, and they 
write with the strong conviction that the hard and 
empty lives of the workers are far more the result 
of conditions imposed upon them than of anything 
inherent in their natures. Those who believe dif- 
ferently, and desire to prove that factory women 
have all they deserve, will point triumphantly to 
the many who are working rather for luxuries than 
for necessities ; who loudly proclaim that they " do 
not have to work." If there appears to be any- 
thing reassuring about this class of cases, our 
complacency rapidly disappears upon closer ex- 
examination. If the girls' ideals and standards are 
low, what has made them so but the society in which 
they live, the environment out of which they cannot 
escape? The desire to be independent, to count for 
something as an individual, is a meritorious one ; and 
if their notion of " counting " is to have good clothes, 
they are not altogether different from many of those 
whose opportunities should have taught them better. 
After all, they do but reach after what seems to 
them worth while, and are willing to suffer much 
for it, a proof at any rate of a certain kind of virtue. 
Moreover, it is not impossible that this virtue fre- 
quently has its reward, in marriage into a higher 
grade of society than that represented by the par- 
ental home. Surely, here we have proof of the 
existence of a great wealth of human energy, poten- 
tially endowed with the seeds of great good, but for 
the most part going to waste or worse, because of 
social and environmental conditions. It is no an- 
swer to say that the rich, who have everything in 
their favor, also many of them squander their lives. 
They likewise are blighted by circumstances, the 
condition of luxurious idleness being as unnatural 
as that of burdensome and never ending toil. So 
here we have two sets of people, the lives of one set 
spoiled so that those of the other set may be spoiled 
also. There are many passages one is tempted to 
quote, and I cannot resist giving these from Miss 
Van Vorst's chapter on "The Child in Southern 
Mills ": 

" In a certain mill in Alabama there are seventy-five child- 
labourers who work twelve hours out of the twenty-four;

cial effort to see my New England friend [an owner of 
Southern mills]. We lunched together this time, and at the 
end of the meal her three little children flattered in to say a 
friendly word. I looked at them, jealous for their little de- 
frauded fellows, whose twelve-hour daily labour served to 
purchase these exqnisit« clothes and to heap with dainties the 
table before ns. But I was nevertheless rejoiced to see oaee 
again the forms of real childhood for whom air and freedom 
aad wealth were doing blessed tasks. When we were alone I 
drew for mr friend as well as I conld pictures of what I had

dish in front of her, ate it delicately and dipped herfingeisin

yon know,' she eontinaed, ' that I believe they are really very 
i-PPT?'" (p. 298). 

The book constitates a strong argament for labor 
aniong. It ig vividly impressed upon the reader 
that the women, who do not organize, are mnch 
worse treated than the men, who do. There are 
some excellent photographic illustrations, and sev- 
eral drawings, most of which are very bad. 

" Americans in Process " is qaite a different sort 
of work. It is based npon years of investigation by 
settlement workers in Boston, and consequently is 
fall of valuable information. Unfortunately for the 
general reader, much of it is presented almost in 
the form of a catalogue, and many of the facts are 
of local rather than universal interest. Parts of it 
remind one a little of a zoological monograph, 
which is fall of interest to anyone who has and is 
studying the creatures of which it treats, but other- 
wise a trifle dry. However, if the reader will per- 
severe as far as the sixth chapter, he will find in 
this and several chapters beyond a great deal which 
is noteworthy and suggestive to the citizen of any 
town, or any stadent of human nature. Particu- 
larly good are the descriptions of the two great 
political bosses, of the North and West Ends respec- 
tively ; of the contrast between the Italians and the 
Jews as shown by their holiday-making ; of the two 
dominant and contrasting religions, — the Jewish 
and Roman Catholic, with Protestantism hardly in 
evidence. The book is an outcome of the activities 
of those modern knights errant who fortunately 
exist in every great city, and we cannot be too 
appreciative of the stand they have taken for the 
right. And as all roads lead to Rome, so we find 
ourselves again in the face of evidence proving the 
destruction of good human t&lent by unfavorable 
conditions. Thus on p. 374 : 

" The Jewish race has an immemorial record as a prolific 
mother of genios. The Italian strain has historically ont- 



ttnpftA all others by being thrice — once politically, 
teligioaaly, once intellectually, — the dominating power of 
the world. Tet it is almost a matter of haphazard whether 
children of these races among na, who may be bom with the 
highest order of capacity, do aot have the spirit within them 
qnenched by a childhood apSBt ia dinaal, degrading streeu. 
Even after such caparity has hwgiiii distinctly to manifest 
itself, we are content oftea to throw it away by not -'-'■^t 
unfailing provision for neceaaaiy training and apprentaee- 
ahip." 

The Rev. J. E. Freeman, in his little book. " If 
not the Saloon — What ? " starts out with some 
chapters as diffuse and free from contributions to 
knowledge as the early chapters of '* Americans in 
Process " are the reverse. But as before, the 
reader is recommended to persevere, and in chapter 
four he will come across an account of Hollywood 
Inn, at Yonkers, N. T., a genuinely successful com- 
petitor of the saloon. This account is clear and 
satisfactory, and is more than worth the small price 
(fifty cents) asked for the book. We strongly 
recommend its perusal, and hope that the excellent 
work at Yonkers will be widely imitated elsewhere. 
Mr. Freeman will do a good service if lat«r on he 
will write another book, giving fuller detaik about 
the Hollywood Inn. 

Professor S. N. Patten's " Heredity and Social 
Progress " is a sort of biological metaphysics. It 
is well written, and likely to be popular (I have 
already read one flattering notice), but I am sorry 
to say it appears to me to be a nearly pure culture 
of nonsense. The author is apparently not a bi- 
ologist, but he reasons on biological subjects in a 
way that is simply astonishing to one who has any 
realization of the intricacies of that science^ and 
seems to me to build elaborate arguments on doubt- 
ful or even erroneous assumptions. Listen to this : 

" A brain is thus an enclosed ovary vrith its contents of lui- 
differentiated cells put to a new use. The enclosed ovary ia 
of the opposite sex to the exposed ovary, aad hea«

In » most attractive little volume 
entitled " A New Portrait of Shake- 
speare" (John Lane), Mr. John 
Corbin, recently known as the author of a sprightly 
account of " An American at Oxford," has given ns 
some very interesting points in regard to the genuine- 
ness, or otherwise, of certain portraits of Shake- 
speare. The sub-title of the book is ''The Case of 
the Ely Palace Painting as against that of the So- 
called Droeshont Original."' and implies what Mr. 
Corbin later states as the purpose of the discussion, 
•• to show that the so-called Droeshont Original is 
probably a fabrication, and that the Ely Palace paint-

as those of the Droeshont Engraving prefixed to

the first folio in 1623, and of the Stratford bust. 
Copies of all of these are given in full-page illus- 
trations, and much of Mr. Corbin's discussion cen- 
tres around the details of costume and features as 
found in these pictures. Some surprising revelations 
are given in regard to the " mock originals " which 
were known to have been circulated by the dozens 
at one time or another. With the knowledge of 
such fraud, we can realize that any deductions in re- 
gard to a life-portrait of Shakespeare must be based 
on the wisest methods of investigation and the most 
cautious acceptance of proofs. Mr. Corbin seems 
to be well fitted for a work of this kind, and takes 
scientific and scholarly satisfaction in his investiga- 
tions. The Ely Palace painting of Shakespeare was 
discovered in 1846. For thirty-two years it hung 
neglected in the house where Shakespeare was born. 
The so-called Droeshout Original has received exactly 
the opposite treatment, and has been repeatedly and 
warmly discussed. After carefully noting all the 
important opinions and discoveries of experts and 
historians in regard to these two portraits, together 
with his own deductions, Mr. Corbin states his con- 
clusions as to what he considers established in the 
discussion, as follows : " The Ely Palace portrait 
is not, as Mr. Lee states, so different from the en- 
graving as ' to raise doubts as to whether the person 
represented could have been intended for Shake- 
speare ' ; but quite to the contrary, it has, of all the 
painted portraits except the spurious Droeshout 
'Original,' the strongest resemblance to the Droe- 
shout engraving. Granting that the Droeshout en- 
graving may not have been taken from the Ely 
Palace portrait, it must have been taken from a 
portrait that in all essential points of features and 
costume was identical with it. Of all the painted por- 
traits, accordingly, the Ely Palace portrait has the 
strongest claim to be regarded as a life-portrait." 

"Architecture, Industry, and Wealth: 
T^l^M^Jm.. Collected Papers by William Morris " 

( Longmans) is a volume bound in red 
cloth with paper label, uniform with so many of 
Morris's works in the popular edition. It contains 
eleven papers, all of them probably published be- 
fore, but none in form more permanent than a 
pamphlet, and five of them now taken from the 
pages of contemporary magazines and journals for 
the first time. " The History of Pattern Designing " 
and "The Lesser Arts of Life," first in the contents 
of this book, were printed together by Macmillan & 
Company in 1882. Following these is " Art, Wealth, 
and Riches," delivered at the Royal Institution, 
Manchester, 6th March, 1883, which is not noted 
anywhere by Mr. Buxton Forman in his account of 
Morris's books. "Art and Socialism: The Aims 
and Ideals of the English Socialists of To-Day," was 
delivered before the Secular Society of Leicester, 
23d January, 1884, and has been printed as a pam- 
phlet; as has "Textile Fabrics," delivered at the 
International Health Exhibition, 11th July, 1884. 
"Art under Plutocracy" is taken from "To- Day" 



of February and March, 1884, having been deliv- 
ered at University College, Oxford, 14th November, 
1883. "The Revival of Architecture " and " The 
Revival of Handicraft " appeared in the " Fort- 
nightly Review" for May and November, 1888, 
respectively. " Art and Industry in the Fourteenth 
Century " is noted here as appearing in " Time " 
for November, 1890, where Mr. Forman says 
January. " The Influence of Building Materials 
upon Architecture " was delivered before the Art 
Workers' Guild at Barnard's Inn Hall, and printed 
in "The Century Guild Hobby Horse," January, 
1892 ; and, finally, " On the External Coverings of 
Roofs " was a leaflet issued by the Society for the 
Protection of Ancient Buildings. This collection, 
as a whole, was printed in the " Golden Type " 
which Morris designed, and was published in July, 
1902, preceding the present popular edition. It 
is hardly needful to characterize the eleven essays 
further than to name them. The figure of Morris 
looms larger and larger in the public eye as time 
permits perspective to be gained, and his marvellous 
versatility is attested by the character of the papers 
included in this work. 



Eihict of Tijg special rules of conduct incum- 

courts, and bent upon those engaged in the prac- 

ciietut. tice of law form the subject-matter 

of a valuable little book by Mr. Geo. W. Warvelle 
of the Chicago bar, entitled " Essays in Legal 
Ethics" (Callaghan & Co.). From the first appear- 
ance of the legal profession in English history, the 
barrister has been considered an integral part of 
the judicial system, as truly an assistant in the ad- 
ministration of justice as is the judge; and although 
in this country the functions of barrister and solicitor 
are not distinguished, the conception has always 
prevailed that the practice of law must not degen- 
erate into a mere scramble for money, but that the 
lawyer has certain definable relations to both court 
and client that cannot be stated in terms of the cash 
nexus. This view has been adopted by our legal 
tribunals, and is enforced by penalties ranging from 
reprimand to disbarment from practice. Thus a 
treatise on legal ethics is no mere collection of 
obiter dicta, but rather a statement of a code pos- 
sessing a widely acknowledged authority and at 
many points armed with the power to secure its 
own enforcement. This non-commercial element, 
which elevates the practice of law to the dignity of 
a profession, appears very clearly in the restrictions 
placed upon the attorney in his dealings with his 
client. " In the relation of attorney and client," 
says the author, " we find a reversal of many of the 
best settled rules of law with respect to contractual 
freedom, and the application of a rule of rigid mo- 
rality that practically precludes the attorney from 
assuming any position toward his client other than 
that of a disinterested and judicious adviser." The 
same underlying principles can be seen in the re- 
lations in which the lawyer is expected to stand to 
the community at large, to the court, and to his fel-

The latest volame of the American 
Sportsman's Library (Macmillan), 
edited by Mr. Caspar Whitney, is 
" The Water-fowl Family," by Mr. L. C. Sanford, 
assisted by Mr. T. S. Van Dyke who writes of " The 
Water-fowl of the Pacific Coast." The name of 
Mr. L. D. Bishop also appears apon the title-page, 
but his share in the book is not made evident in 
the table of contents or elsewhere. The illastra- 
tions, by Messrs. Loois Agassiz Fuertes, Charles 
Livingston Bull, A. B. Frost, and others, are fre- 
quent and of excellent execution in technical and 
artistic details. This ample volume of 600 pages 
is a most valuable addition to this library. It in- 
cludes our most popular game birds, and will in- 
terest more sportsmen than any other volume in 
the series. Not only is it broad in scope, bat in 
literary execution it has reached the high-water 
mark among books of its class. The pleasing inter- 
ludes of anecdote and narrative add interest and 
enliven the pages, while the main subject itself is 
fully treated without excess of technical lingo or 
display of artful devices. After an introductory 
account of shooting from passes, over decoys, in 
the wild-rice fields, and from bush blinds, the au- 
thor gives his personal experiences with many of 
our water- fowl on a wide range of noted hunting 
grounds. As a remedy for the decrease in these 
wild-fowl, which has become so apparent in recent 
years, the anthor recommends a universal law 
throughout the United States against spring shoot- 
ing ; a limitation of exposure of game birds for sale 
in public markets to short seasons, if indeed at all ; 
a prohibition of all preservation of game in cold 
storage; prevention of state exportation, and an 
individual limit to the number killed. The increase 
and g^eat tameness of these wild-fowl in our pro- 
tected National Parks is recorded with approval. 
The greater part of the book is taken up with de- 
scriptions of individual game-birds, ducks, geese, 
swans, rails, snipe, and other shore birds, with many 
notes of interest to the sportsman and to the natur- 
alist. A synopsis for determination of the water- 
fowl closes the volume, well-planned and well 
wrought out into a comprehensive manual which 
will be a boon to every sportsman. 



Jfatyre-atudy 
in education. 



It is a large place in education which 
Professor Liberty H. Bailey claims 
for " The Nature-Study Idea" (Dou- 
bleday. Page & Co.), and a place, moreover, not 
held by any other subject in the school curriculum. 
It is not a mere adjunct to an already over-crowded 
coarse of study, bat a fundamental epoch-making 
movement which will touch the masses with a new 
educational impulse and bring a stronger and more 



resourceful life to the pupil led by this means into 
a fuller and more intimate sympathy with Nature 
and his environment. While all readers of this 
stimulating and suggestive book may not be so 
sanguine as the author in his hope that nature- 
study will relieve the school-room of perfunctory 
methods and of dessicated science, none will fail 
to see the promise for great effectiveness in this 
direction which this new view-point brings to pri- 
mary education. The thing itself, not the book 
about it, — the living bobolink, not even the staffed 
specimen, — the process of discovery, rather than 
the fact observed, — these stamp the nature-study 
idea as revolutionary in educational methods. It is 
not science, but a method which has room for fancy 
and sentiment as well as fact, and its net result is a 
little knowledge and more love of Nature's forms 
and an independent habit of seeing things intelli- 
gently as they really are. In this lies the solution 
of the agricultural problem, the spiritualizing of 
agricalture, and also the ground for a new ethics of 
sport with gun and rod and of man's relations to 
other living things. Seekers for definite schedules 
of courses, specific directions for nature-study les- 
sons, or illustrations of matter and method, will be 
disappointed in Professor Bailey's treatise; but those 
who seek inspiration will find his pages breathing 
that spirit which gives life in all things. 

The first volume of the long-promised 
edition of " The Poems of Philip 
Freneaa," edited for the Princeton 
Historical Association by Professor Fred Lewis Pat- 
tee, has now been issued by the Library of Princeton 
University — the university of which Freneau was 
a graduate. It is a large, handsome octavo of some 
four hundred pages, and includes a careful intro- 
ductory study of the poet's life and works ; early 
poems, 1768-1775 ; and the poems of " the first 
poetic period," 1775-1781. The editor has spared 
no pains to make an authoritative text ; in this effort 
he has had the assistance of Mr. John Rogers Wil- 
liams, the general editor of the Association. There 
are numerous footnotes, mainly devoted to textual 
and bibliog^raphical details, bat also inclading Fre- 
neaa's own annotations. The list of variant read- 
ings is very large, in consequence of the several 
revisions to which Freneaa subjected his poems. 
The f alness of the textual " apparatus " famished 
is illustrated by " The Rising Glory of America," 
in which the edition of 1809 is followed, but the 
complete text of the now rare edition of 1772 is 
added at the foot of the page. The biographical 
sketch of Freneaa is admirable in every respect. 
The tone is fair and candid, and full justice is done 
to the character and genius of the poet ; while hero- 
worship does not blind the biographer to the faults 
which the poet certainly possessed, even though he 
shared them with his contemporaries. For example, 
he does not wholly exonerate Freneau in regard to 
the conduct of " The National Gazette," but says 
that " neither side is free from blame." This view

The meaning

IB gubatantially in accord with the one taken by Dr. 
Forman in his recent study of "The Political Ac- 
tivities of Philip Freneau." Both writers, however, 
agpree in attributing the sincerest motives to the edi- 
tor of " The Gazette." On the whole, the edition is 
altogether worthy of the real " Father of American 
Poetry," who at last seems to be coming to his own. 

In Mr. John C. Van Dyke's latest 
contribution to the literature of art, 
there is a singularly happy blend 
of strong personal sentiment and sound doctrine. 
The writer goes into " The Meaning of Pictures " 
(Scribner) with enthusiasm and yet with judgment, 
and so has given us a book that makes very good 
reading whether we wish to go to school or merely 
to be interested. The book contains six lectures 
delivered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 
subject is considered from the view-point of a mind 
open to the reasonable claims of those for whom 
pictures are made, while not closed to the consider- 
ations that enter into the making of them, and is 
presented in a way that is singularly entertaining. 
We have a general statement of what painted pict- 
ures — from Botticelli to Whistler, from Raphael 
to Degas, from saints and madonnas to ballet 
girls — mean to those at large for whom they are 
painted. The writer's philosophy of this art — a 
very sane one, as would naturally follow from the 
state of mind indicated — is dressed out in such 
diction, and pointed with such apt illustrations and 
comparisons, that the reader easily absorbs it, and 
gets ideas about art that will modify his views and 
help him to subordinate personal preferences to 
principles in his judgment of it. It may be ques- 
tioned if any other book of its scope hat) ever shown 
" the meaning of pictures " in a way that will make 
it so clear to the average English reader. The text 
is illustrated with thirty excellent reproductions 
of paintings selected from the period it covers, a 
period that embraces all that greatly signifies in 
this art. 

A»gmiu,ca:,ar', I' ^eems Strange that the English 
firit biography language should have gone without 
♦n Engiuh. ^ biography of Augustus Caesar un- 

til the present year, — but in their search for more 
" Heroes of the Nations " to write about, the Messrs. 
Putnam have hit upon him at last, and have sup- 
plied the deficiency so far as the limitations of the 
series would allow. Like others of the series, it is 
a book for the mature reader rather than the boy, 
and it seems a pity that the publishers should have 
selected a general title with so hopelessly juvenile 
a sound. Mr. J. B. Firth, the author of this vol- 
ume, sets forth the facts of the career of Augustus 
fairly, but many will not follow him in his readi- 
ness to excuse all the means by which the Roman 
Empire was established. The tendency to make 
success itself the moral test of the means by which 
it was secured is carried rather too far in these 
days. Readers of Tacitus will remember how often 
Tiberius plead the example of Augustus in support 



of his own policy. The present volume will certainly 
deepen the impression of a fundamental resem- 
blance between the two emperors, not only in their 
policy but in many personal features as well. Mr. 
Firth supports the " Dyarchy " theory of the nature 
of the Roman Empire in its earlier history, but he 
brings forward no case in which the Senate exer- 
cised its alleged powers contrary to the will of the 
Emperor at the time. A dyarchy in which one 
member acts only by the gracious concession of the 
other, is but a virtual monarchy after all. It need 
only be added that in its mechanical execation the 
volume is a worthy representative of the well-known 
series to which it belongs.

Two recent additions to the "Pop- 
ular Library of Art" (Dutton) are 
devoted to two such diverse person- 
alities as DUrer and Millet. In both cases, the in- 
terest in the individual is almost coordinate with 
that in the artist. The stories of their lives, though 
relatively simple, are full of interest, and reflect the 
different situation of the artist in the social life of 
the period. The DUrer biography is written by Miss 
Lina Eckenstein, and, though not acknowledged as 
a translation, certainly reads as such. It is a well- 
told tale, in which the personal side appears out 
of proportion to the account of the artist's achieve- 
ments ; but it gives in brief compass, and with well- 
chosen illustrations, a suggestive account of the 
deeds of a great man. The book on Millet is a 
translation from the French of M. Remain Rolland ; 
but the translation is remarkably smooth. The 
simple incidents in the life of this artist are well 
put together to make an interesting and impressive 
story of final triumph over adverse personal cir- 
cumstances. Millet remains the best type of the 
peasant artist, and throughout his life he reflected 
both in bis work and personality the intimate con- 
tact with soil and nature, as well as the abhorrence 
of the artificialities of city life, all of which gives 
individuality to his work and makes it a central 
point in the history of modern French art. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



We have received from Messrs. Houghton, MifBin & 
Co. Parts I. and II. of a new work on " Trees and 
Shrubs," by Professor Charles Sprague Sargent. This 
work is supplementary to the author's monumental 
" Silva of North America," and will, when completed, 
add two uew quarto volumes to the twelve of the main 
work. It seems that during the progress of Professor 
Sargent's undertaking, nearly a hundred aud fifty new 
arboreal species have received botanical recognition, 
and it is to the description of these hitherto unrecog- 
nized forms that the supplementary volumes will be 
devoted. The sections now issued describe, with plates, 
fifty ligneous species, of which no less than fifteen be- 
long to the single genus Crataegus, of which the author 
has been making an exhaustive study during recent 
years. When these new volumes are completed they 
will contain an index to the entire work.

The text of ■' The Sulten of Snla," Mr. George Ade's 
popular comic opera, is published in an illustrated toI- 
ume by Mr. R. H. RusselL 

" Hero Stories from American History," by Messrs. 
Albert F. Blaisdell and Francis K. Ball, is an elemen- 
tary reading-book pablished by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

The American Book Co. are the publishers of " The 
American Standard Bookkeeping " of Mr. C. C. Curtiss. 
This is a work intended for the use of secondary schools. 
Mr. John H. Walsh is the author of a " New Primary 
Arithmetic " and a " New Grammar School Arithmetic," 
the latter in two yolumes, just published by Messrs. 
D. C. Heath & Co. 

" The Sciences," by Professor Edward S. Holden, is 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. as a reading book for 
children. The book is simple and lucid in treatment, 
and has a great many illustrations. 

" How to Keep Well," by Dr. Floyd M. Crandall, is 
one of those practical books which we do not call litera- 
ture, but which have patent uses of their own. It is a 
recent publication of ^lessrs. Donbleday, Page & Co. 

" The Spanish in the Southwest," by Miss Rosa V. 
Winterbum, is a new volume of the "Eclectic School 
Readings " published by the American Book Co. An- 
other new volume in this series is "Two Girls in 
China," by Miss Mary H. Krout. 

Mr. Charles H. Kerr is the publisher of the following 
socialistic works: "God's Children," a modern allegory 
by Mr. James Allman; "The Boots of the Socialist 
Philosophy," translated from Feuerbach by Mr. Fred- 
erick Engels; and "Class Struggles in America," a 
pamphlet by Mr. A. M. Simons. 

New editions of Lever and Bulwer are started, re- 
spectively, with "Harry Lorrequer " and "Night and 
Morning." They are charming pocket volumes, bound 
in limp leather, and published by Mr. George Newnes, 
from whom the editions are imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner for the American market. 

Mr. Warren K. Moorehead has in preparation an 
exhaustive archaeological encyclopaedia devoted to the 
implements, ornaments, etc., of the pre- historic tribes 
of the United States. The work will be issued in two 
volnmes, fully illustrated, by the Robert Clarke Co. of 
Cincinnati, during the winter of 1905. 

Mr. Howard WilfordBell, a London publisher, sends 
us a volume of " Pens^es from the Journal Intime of 
Henri-Fr^d^ric Amiel," arranged by Mr. D. K. Petano. 
M. Bourget's " Etude " prefaces the volume, whose 
contents are given in the English language, althoogh 
this would hardly be inferred from the title. 

The Macmillan Co. will issue at once the first volnme 
in a limited edition de luxe of the complete works of 
Matthew Arnold, uniform with their previous special 
editions of Lamb, Pater, FitzGerald, and others. The 
fifteenth and final volume of the set will contain a 
complete bibliography of Arnold's writings, compiled 
by Mr. Thomas Burnett Smart. 

The latest preprints from the University of Chisago 
decennial publications include the following mono- 
graphs: " Greek Papyri from the Cairo Museum," by 
Mr. Edgar J. Goodspeed; " The Medicine-Man and the 
Professional Occupations," by Professor M.I. Thomas; 
" Empire and Sovereignty," by Professor Ernst Freund; 
" Loan Credit in Modern Business," by Professor Thor- 
stein B. Veblen; " The Decline of the Missi Dominiei in 



Frankish Gaul," by Professor James Westfall Thomp- 
son; "Two Old Spanish Versions of the Disticha 
Catonis," by Professor Karl Pietsch; and "The Rela- 
tions of Psychology to Philosophy," by Professor James 
Rowland Angell. 

We have from Brentano's a translation, by Mr. Ar- 
thur Edward Waite, of Senancour's " Obermann," a work 
less read to-day than talked about, yet which certainly 
deserved translation long before this. A translation by 
Miss Frothingham has preceded the present one, but is 
published at a high price in a limited edition, so that 
we still have room for Mr. Waite's version. An elabor- 
ate introduction, both critical and biographical, adds 
materially to the valne of the present work. 

" The Complete Poetical Works of Alexander Pope," 
edited by Mr. H. W. Boynton, has been added to the 
" Cambridge " poets published by Messrs. Houghton, 
Miffiin & Co. Mr. Boynton's introduction is compact 
and discriminating, and he has also provided a helpful 
and not over-swollen body of notes. The poems are 
printed in a nearly chronological order, and the text, a 
result of careful collation, is based upon the standard 
Croker-Elwin-Courthope edition. Pope's own notes 
have for the most part been retained, except that all of 
his notes to Homer have been omitted. Only Pope's 
own part of the " Odyssey " — the first half — is here 
included. We thus have a serviceable Pope in a single 
volume, which is, as far as we know, the first of its 
I kind. 

I Mr. Albert Sonnichsen, who will be recalled as having 
set down his experiences in book form after a captivity 
of nearly a year among the Filipinos, now writes 
" Deep Sea V^agabonds " (McClure, Phillips & Co.), an- 
nouncing himself as " able seaman " on the title-page 
and proving his right to the name on every page sae- 
ceeding. The book makes its appeal as a transcript 
from real life, not g^reatly idealized, and saved from 
much of the brutalizing effect of life on the high seas 
in merchant vessels by a sunny disposition and the fact 
that the author had the wit to avoid American mer- 
chantmen and their bnllying bncko mates. Real skill 
is shown in setting down these memoirs, and Mr. Son- 
nichsen'g unwillingness to indulge in the coarser vices 
of his fellows gives a reason for his clear insight into 
the sailor's inner life. As might be expected, he has 
been everywhere and seen everything, at least on the 
coasts of the world. But he is characteristically less 
concerned with life ashore than with life afloat. 

Professor Arber's " English Gamer " was published in 
eight volumes during the period between 1877 and 
1890, and the work has been ever since a treasare- 
honse for the student of early English history and 
literature. A reissue of the work, extended to twelve 
volumes, is now being made under the editorship of 
Mr. Thomas Seccombe, the contents being classified for 
the first time, and pieced out by the addition of fresh 
matter. Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the American 
publishers of this new edition, of which four volnmes 
have already reached us. Two of the four are devoted 
to " Voyages and Travels," and have an introduction by 
Mr. C. Raymond Beazley; the other two are "Social 
England Illustrated," with an introduction by Mr. 
I Andrew Lang, and " Critical Essays and Literary Frag- 
\ ments," with an introduction by Mr. J. Chnrton Collins. 
I The new issue thus becomes a series of separate works, 
each with its own introduction and index, and is conse- 
quently far more useful than was Professor Arber's 
original publication.

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 1903. 



JUST PUBLISHED. 
ON THE 

" Polar Star 

IN THE 

Arctic Sea 

By H. R. H. the Duke of the 
ABRUZZI. 

TWO LARGE OCTAVO VOLS., $12.50 NET. 



?? 



The Polar Record Broken. 



A book of Surpassing Interest, eagerly antici- 
pated by a large number of readers the world over. 
The expedition reached a point Farther North than 
any band of explorers has ever done. 



HANDSOMELY PRODUCED IN TWO LARGE OCTAVO 
VOLUMES. ILLUSTRATED WITH SIXTEEN PHOTO- 
ORAVURES AND OVER TWO HUNDRED PHOTO- 
GRAPHS, TAKEN BY THE DUKE HIMSELF. THE 
ILLUSTRATIONS INCLUDE THE FAMOUS MAP BY 
CAPTAIN CAGNI, GIVING HIS ROUTE WHEN HE 
PENETRATED TO 86? 34' NORTH LATITUDE. 



From the "New York Times." 

*' Its paf^es not only contain an account of the little happenings of a 
little world in which all social barriers, save those of naval discipline, 
had been dispensed with, but also the conversation of members of the 
party, the suggestions, comments, and criticisms of various projects 
which might have meant so much had they been carried out. Written 
on the spot, this journal readily conveys to the reader the emotions ex- 
perienced by the party on the return of the successful sledging expedi- 
tions. Like the assembly on the ' Stella Polare * the Buke^s readers are 
taken into his confidence, and become, perhaps, even better acquainted 
with him than were the members of his crew. The book is sure to pos- 
sess intense human interest as a document by an enthusiastic explorer, 
who, incidentally, is a member of the royal house of Savoy." 



THE book 19 written in a thoroughly enjoyable manner ; 
bright, vivid, conversational. It presents a wonderfully 
interesting story in an easy, picturesque style. Much curious 
information is given, as regards sleeping bags, methods of 
wearing arctic clothing, the amounts and kinds of food to be 
eaten in arctic regions, besides the narrative of the voyage it- 
self. Captain Cagni gives his own account of how he reached 
the farthest point north. Doctor Cavalli gives some remark- 
ably interesting information regarding the effects of the cold 
climate on the physical condition of the members of the expe- 
dition, together with other unusual data. 



Salient Points of the Work: 

The style Is straightforward — unadorned ; 
thoroughly authentic ; beautifully illustrated ; 
humorous bits here and there ; no bewildering 
mass of technicalities.
