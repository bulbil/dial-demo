strong, pulses \n it, and to that heart of life no one can approach save

PIRATE GOLD. 

By F. J. STIMSON (" J. S. of Dale "). $1.25. 
" Mr. Stimson is one of the few successful novelists who can be 
accused of having written too little. This striking and original story 
finds uncommonly good subject matter in the contrast between the 
plain, sober life of the Boston of half a century ago and the romance of 
the sea which had not yet passed away from its wharves." Spring- 
field Republican. 

THE PARSON'S PROXY. 

By KATE W. HAMILTON. $1.25. 

" Although full of humor, ' The Parson's Proxy ' has strong ele- 
ments of pathos and tragedy also. It is a story of the mountain region 
of West Virginia and Kentucky. ... It is a book which, in a time 
when the press was not turning out twenty or thirty volumes of fiction 
per day, more or less, would have attracted such attention as only the 
successes of twenty-five years ago aroused." Cleveland World.

THE FICTION OF THE SEASON. 



MAGGIE: A GIRL OF THE STREETS. 

By STEPHEN CRANE, author of " The Red Badge of Courage," 
etc. Uniform with " The Red Badge of Courage." 12mo, 
cloth, 75 cents. 

In this book the author pictures certain realities of city life, 
and he has not contented himself with a search for humorous 
material or with superficial aspects. His story lives, and its 
actuality cannot fail to produce a deep impression and to point 
a moral which many a thoughtful reader will apply. 

THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. 

An Episode of the American Civil War. By STEPHEN CRANE. 

Tenth edition. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

"Never before have we had the seamy side of glorious war so well 
depicted. . . . The rank and file has its historian at last, and we have 
had nothing finer." Chicago Evening Post. 

"A book with a mighty theme. . . . Stands absolutely alone." 
Boston Transcript. 

YEKL. 

A Tale of the New York Ghetto. By A. CAHAN. Uniform 
with "The Red Badge of Courage." 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 
In " Yekl " Mr. Cahan has opened a field which with us has 
remained almost untouched. It is safe to say that the life of 
the modern Ghetto has not been described with so much ex- 
act knowledge and truthfulness. The "sweat-shops" and 
the amusements of the Ghetto are pictured with singular viv- 
idness, and the developments of this remarkable story bring 
forward humorous, pathetic, and sordid phases of New York 
life which will be new to readers of fiction. 

SIR MARK. 

A Tale of the First Capital. By ANNA ROBESON BROWN. 

IGmo, cloth, 75 cents. 

This charming historical romance by a young American 
writer describes picturesque phases of life in the closing years 
of the last century in both the Old World and the New. Amid 
the incidents of this stirring tale the reader obtains a vivid 
insight into the social and political life of Philadelphia the 
first capital and he sees the stately figures of Washington, 
Jefferson, and Franklin. 

GREEN GATES. 

An Analysis of Foolishness. By Mrs. K. M. C. MEREDITH 
(Johanna Staats), author of "Drumsticks," etc. 16mo, 
cloth, $1.25. 

This brilliant story of to-day furnishes pictures of Long 
Island country-house and hunting life and of social incidents 
in New York. The tale exhibits an originality and a peculiar 
pathos which will enlist the interest of every reader.

By R. S. HICHENS, author of " An Imaginative Man," " The 
Green Carnation," etc. 16mo, cloth, 75 cents.

peculiarly his own." Pall Mall Gazette. 

SLEEPING FIRES. 

By GEORGE GISSING, author of "In the Year of Jubilee," 
" Eve's Ransom," etc. IGmo, cloth, 75 cents. 
" Mr. Gissing's style is powerful and interesting, his handling of sit- 
uations masterful, and his point of view original. . . . The story leaves 
a vivid and impressive picture on the memory, and is far above the av- 
erage fiction of to-day." Chicago Journal. 



THE SEATS OF THE MIGHTY. 

Being the Memoirs of Captain Robert Moray, sometime an 
Officer in the Virginia Regiment, and afterwards of Am- 
herst's Regiment. By GILBERT PARKER, author of "Pierre

passer," etc. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" Another historical romance of the vividness and intensity of ' The 

Seats of the Mighty ' has never come from the pen of an American. 

. . . From the first chapter to the last word interest never wanes. It 

whirls with excitement and strange adventure. . . . One of the books 

of the year." Chicago Record. 

"By long odds the best story that has appeared this season."

trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" Stands out distinctively as the best story Mrs. Cotes has produced. ' '

manifestly based on a close observation of detail, and the story moves 
forward with a command of incident and situation that leaves nothing 
to be desired." Boston Beacon. 

THE REDS OF THE MIDI. 

An Episode of the French Revolution. By FELIX GRAS. 

Translated from the Provencal by Mrs. CATHARINE A. 

JANVIER. With an Introduction by THOMAS A. JANVIER. 

With Frontispiece. 16mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" As we read this fascinating, marvellously intense book, it seems as 
though the whole story of what gave rise to the French Revolution were 
compressed within its pages. . . . The art with which this story is told 
is exquisite. ... A wonderful book." Buffalo Commercial. 

" It has the charm that is only felt in the foremost works of pictur- 
esquely realistic fiction, and its rapidity of movement and wealth of 
incident instantly command attention." Boston Budget.

SCIENCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 

Professor N. S. Shaler, in a recent contribu- 
tion to " Science," tells the following story : 

" The professor of mineralogy in Harvard University 
one day observed two young women examining his min- 
eral cabinet, one of whom was evidently searching for 
some particular species. Offering his help, he found 
that the object of her quest was feldspar. When shown 
the mineral she seemed very much interested in the 
specimens, expressing herself as gratified at having the 
chance to see and touch them. The professor asked her 
why she so desired to see the particular mineral. The 
answer was that for some years she had been obliged to 
teach in a neighboring high school, among other things, 
mineralogy and geology, and that the word feldspar 
occurred so often in the text-book that her curiosity had 
become aroused as to its appearance." 

Upon reading such a story, the first impulse 
of anyone having to do with educational work 
is to make it the text for a disquisition upon 
the incapacity that our schools so often serve to 
shelter. Undoubtedly, the gravest defect in 
our system of public education is that it gives 
employment to, or rather that it is forced to 
put up with, teachers who have no scientific 
knowledge of the subjects in which they give 
what is called instruction. But this theme is 
so well-worn that we should despair of finding 
anything new to say about it. There is, how- 
ever, an aspect of the matter that is compara- 
tively neglected, and upon which it may be well 
to offer a few reflections. 

Professor Shaler has a well-earned reputa- 
tion as a specialist in geology, but he proves to 
be unlike most specialists in one very important 
respect. Instead of urging, as many men would 
have done under the circumstances, a better 
school equipment in geology, and the employ- 
ment of carefully-trained teachers, he questions 
the advisability of including his subject at all 
in the work of the secondary school. He says : 

" For my own part, while it seems to me that some 
general notions concerning the history of the earth may 
very well be given to children, and this as information, 
it is futile to essay any study in this science which is 
intended to make avail of its larger educative influences 
with immature youths. The educative value of geology 
depends upon an ability to deal with the large concep- 
tions of space, time, and the series of developments of 
energy which can only be compassed by mature minds. 
Immature youths, even if they intend to win the utmost 
profit from geology, would be better occupied in study- 
ing the elementary tangible facts of those sciences such 
as chemistry, physics, or biology, sciences which in their 



8 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



synthesis constitute geology, rather than in a vain en- 
deavor to deal in an immediate way with a learning 
which in a good measure to be profitable has to be ap- 
proached with a well developed mind. The very fact 
that any considerable geological problem is likely to 
involve in its discussion some knowledge of physics, 
chemistry, zoology, and botany is sufficient reason for 
postponing the study until the pupil is nearly adult." 

One of the most satisfactory features of the 
discussion of which secondary education has 
recently been made the subject is the tendency 
to concentrate the work in natural science upon 
a few subjects, in order to do fuller justice to 
whatever work of that class is attempted. There 
is a growing recognition of the simple fact that 
science is a discipline and not a mere matter of 
information, and those who best appreciate the 
value of science in secondary education are 
coming to realize that better results may be 
gained by the serious study of two or three sub- 
jects than by the superficial survey of half a 
dozen. As long as science-teaching was an 
affair of the text-book and the memoriter exer- 
cise, it did not much matter whether the sub- 
jects taught were few or many ; in either case, 
they contributed next to nothing to the stu- 
dent's intellectual growth. But we have got 
distinctly beyond that primitive stage in our 
methods, and have learned to recognize the all- 
important character of the laboratory and the 
note- book. 

This being the case, we are brought face to 
face with the fact that few schools are large 
enough or sufficiently well-supported to afford 
the luxury of half a dozen laboratory outfits, 
and that the old-fashioned high-school curricu- 
lum, with its " fourteen weeks " in this science 
and its half-year in that, has become hopelessly 
antiquated. The reason why the young woman 
in Professor Shaler's story had never seen a 
piece of feldspar was probably that she had 
been set to teach, besides geology, a medley of 
such subjects as physics, chemistry, botany, 
zoology, astronomy, and human physiology. 
Under the circumstances it would have been 
unreasonable to expect her to know feldspar by 
sight ; or, for that matter, to dissect a cat, or 
perform an operation in quantitative analysis. 
Professor Tarr, in " The Educational Review " 
for June, gives us a delightful bit of personal 
experience with the system that produces sci- 
ence teachers who have never seen feldspar to 
know it. He says : " A short time ago, I found 
a teacher in a normal school in the State of 
New York, who, with the aid of an assistant, was 
obliged to try to train teachers to impart instruc- 
tion in physiology, anatomy, zoology, botany, 



geology, physical geography, geography proper, 
astronomy, physics, and chemistry. Now tem- 
perance physiology is added." The sooner the 
absurdity of such an attempt is realized, and 
the sooner our high schools throw overboard 
two-thirds of this ill-assorted cargo, the more 
likely science will be to justify the claims that 
have so long been made on its behalf, and 
that have thus far remained at ludicrous vari- 
ance with its results, as far, at least, as three- 
fourths of our high schools and colleges are 
concerned. 

Professor Tarr's suggestion for the reorgan- 
ization of science work in the secondary school 
is worthy of consideration, although we think 
that it makes too great a concession to an un- 
worthy popular ideal. He urges, in brief, that 
each secondary school should make a specialty 
of one scientific subject, teaching it in the most 
approved modern way, with the help of collec- 
tions, apparatus, and laboratories. The other 
subjects, in response to " the demand of the 
people for information in the various branches 
of national science," should be distinctly classed 
(for that school) as " minor sciences," and pur- 
sued in the old superficial way. Meanwhile, the 
colleges should come to the aid of the schools 
by permitting a greater freedom of choice in 
their entrance requirements, so that prepara- 
tory work done in one subject should be as 
available for admission as work done in any 
other, provided that it meet a somewhat rigid 
set of conditions as to methods and time em- 
ployed. 

While some such plan as this may be found 
necessary, as marking the transitional stage of 
secondary work in which we are likely to remain 
for some years yet, it can hardly be urged as a 
finality. Our ultimate aim must be, in all the 
grades of school and college work, to secure the 
best, even at the cost of a somewhat ruthless 
treatment of the indefensible popular notion. 
We must resolutely seek to subordinate the 
ideal of information to the ideal of discipline, 
and be willing to relegate to personal tastes 
and later opportunities the acquisition of knowl- 
edge upon many subjects of the highest scien- 
tific importance. What is all-important to the 
student is a comprehension of the method of 
science ; he may safely be left, if this is once 
given him, to possess himself of as much of the 
matter as his inclinations and interests may 
demand. A narrow but thorough discipline is 
vastly better than a wide and discursive range 
of information. This may be got without the 
stimulus of a strictly-ordered programme ; that

will hardly be acquired except under guidance 
at school or college. Perhaps the best evidence 
of the value of such a training as is here advo- 
cated may be found in the higher education of 
the traditional English system. That system 
has often been charged with ignoring many 
important intellectual interests, and there is no 
doubt that it has done so. But its vindication 
may be found in the type of trained intellect 
that it has projected into the arena of public 
life, and amply satisfies the judicious observer. 



THE CYNICISM OF THACKERAY AND 
THE SADNESS OF GEORGE ELIOT. 

It would be useless to deny that in the novels of 
Thackeray and George Eliot, if you go deep enough 
and pause to reflect, there is an undercurrent of 
cynicism or sadness. But one is very unfortunately 
constituted who can see nothing in the great tender 
heart of Thackeray but a love of depicting human 
failings and shams, or who can overlook George 
Eliot's exquisite play of humor and imagination, 
and impute to her everywhere an impenetrable sad- 
ness. What we think of these authors will depend, 
I fancy, on our passing mood no less than on the 
view of life we may have formulated for ourselves. 
"We are all optimists and pessimists by turns. We 
have our gray days and gold. There are times 
when our spiritual eye is shut, if not blinded, when 
we are inclined to believe that meanness and snob- 
bery and unhappiness prevail : then Thackeray is no 
cynic to us, nor even a satirist, but a veritable 
realist. After some lively experience of human 
rascality or baseness, we believe for the moment 
that he drew Becky Sharp and the Marquis of 
Steyne from life. Then we patch up the vagrant 
shreds of his wisdom into a " philosophy," and, hav- 
ing no better, affect with him " the vanity of all 
things and the enjoyment of as much as you can." 
But the majority are, or like to think they are, con- 
stitutional optimists. To them Thackeray is a sat- 
irist. They begrudge him the title of humorist. 
They see too plainly " black care behind the moody 
horseman." His mirth proceeds from his melan- 
choly, which they cannot discern is " relieved by an 
always present capacity for instant frolic." They 
deprive themselves of a great deal of pleasure by 
dubbing him " cynic," or " sceptic " (as Mr. Whipple 
preferred) ; and, insisting on these names, which 
imply a more or less elaborate system of unbelief, 
they do him an injustice. For was there ever a 
novelist who had less conception of principles, who 
inquired less earnestly into the meaning and pur- 
pose of phenomena? As well might we expect a 
close analysis of motives from Scott, who intended 
" Ivanhoe " to be " a tale of chivalry, not of char- 
acter," and said, " The world will not expect from 
me a poem in which the interest turns on char- 



acter." Thackeray inspected human nature pretty 
narrowly in parts. He caught the peculiarities of 
individuals. The trend of things was beyond him. 
The world was a great spectacle that drifted care- 
lessly before his eyes, alternately pathetic or gay, 
always picturesque. He did not occupy himself 
with grand passions or mighty sentiments. We 
forgive his limited vision " because of the telling." 
Not a page but has the merit of being readable. 
Some cynics, indeed, are very interesting, and, once 
roused to the pitch of enthusiasm, delight beyond 
measure. Jacques was a cynic, and how admirable, 
when he bursts upon us with his 

" A fool, a fool ! I met a fool i' the forest, 
A motley fool ; a miserable world ! ' ' 

which, apart from Arden, has a very Thackerayan 
ring. 

Now George Eliot, with her profound moral pur- 
pose and grasp of life as a whole, was less free to 
charm us by the way. Superficial attractions are 
not often coupled with such originality and power. 
Leaving out of the question the critics, who have 
generally managed to find an overflowing humor in 
her novels with the possible exception of " Deronda," 
and vaguely granting that she was at heart a pes- 
simist, shall we let her gloomy philosophy so reso- 
lutely concealed, her unparaded despair, be the cri- 
terion of our literary judgment? Is every novel 
predominantly sad? Shall there be no discrimina- 
tion between her early and her late work ? Shall 
The Mill on the Floss " and " Silas Marner " be 
classed with " Middlemarch " and " Deronda " ? In 
" Adam Bede," do the quaint, brusque philosophy of 
the workshop and the sketch of Chad's Bess and the 
inimitable wit of Mrs. Poyser count for nothing 
against the dark screen of passion ? Who will say 
that "' Middlemarch " is not as full of humor as of 
the ironies of fate, with its Mr. Brooke, " who had 
travelled in his younger years, and was held to have 
contracted a too rambling habit of mind" ; with its 
Mrs. Cadwallader, the rector's wife, who was u obliged 
to get her meals by stratagem, and pray to heaven for 
her salad oil "; with its pompous Mr. Trumbull, who 
went through his illness " much sustained by appli- 
cation of the thermometer which implied the import- 
ance of his temperature, by the sense that he fur- 
nished objects for the microscope, and by learning 
many new words which seemed suited to the dignity 
of his secretions." True, the enigmas of existence 
and destiny are in the background, constantly puz- 
zling the logical sense and the imagination ; but, as 
one reads, he is quite as susceptible to the author's 
graces of style, her humor, her eloquence, her graphic 
portrayal of character. As in life, so in a novel, it 's 
the little things that make or mar an hour's enjoy- 
ment. One must feel that he is in agreeable com- 
pany. Be the story blithe and tactful, sparkling 
cheerily on the surface, he will, for the moment, be 
lulled to forget distressful problems, like the child 
in the old German fable who picked the berries 
that grew in the cleft of the rock, oblivious of the

abyss beneath, and of the fierce dragon lying in wait 
on the firm ground above. 

But no thoughtful reader can, in the long run, 
neglect the interpretation of the scroll. Anthony 
Trollope went so far as to assert that " the object of 
a novel should be to instruct in morals while it 
amuses." There is truth in the assertion, though 
it reverses the natural order, and " amuse " is too 
light a word to convey the serious artistic purpose of 
one who would portray human society or character. 

So very much is required of a great artist. No 
wonder Thackeray did n't take himself seriously as 
a moralist ! Most of his stories, all but " Esmond " 
perhaps, read as if he began them with no certainty 
of how they should come out. And yet they are, 
part by part, nobly perfect. Kather than call "Van- 
ity Fair " an " outrage on the constitution of the 
world," or go to the other extreme and declare its 
moral to be that " the Amelias of the world, with 
all their simplicity and ignorance, will, in the long 
run, succeed better than the Becky Sharps," is it not 
better first to inquire if it had a moral? Shall we 
love him less if we find that he sought merely to 
transcribe life as he observed it, extracting what 
measure of humor he could for our entertainment? 
Generous, guileless soul ! How many of the novelists 
of to-day have exerted so beneficent an influence ? 
It was a law of the Medes and Persians, worthy of 
all homage, never to speak evil of a man who had 

given you pleasure. _.

THE PUZZLE OF ENGLISH HEXAMETERS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Of course all intelligent critics agree that English 
hexameters, conforming to Greek or Latin rules of 
" quantity by position," etc., are extremely difficult to 
compose. In the very example quoted approvingly by 
your reviewer of my " Art and Humanity in Homer " 
(THE DIAL, June 1) there are, not one, but four, vio- 
lations of this very law! With the important additional 
burden of faithful adherence to an original text, any 
such attempt becomes ludicrously hopeless. 

But everyone feels, too, that English syllables are not 
actually long or short in accordance with any such " law." 
Quantity, in a sense, we have still, but largely variable, 
with many gradations, affected greatly by accent and 
cadence, partly even within the control of a judicious 
reciter. All English verse in such metres e. g., " Loch- 
invar," which is " anapaestic " are read in about 3-8 
time, instead of 4-8, the accented part of each foot pre- 
dominating, a " dactyl " becoming (circa) a quarter-note, 
followed by two sixteenth-notes. Hence the chief dan- 
ger in the rhythm is that we may force into the latter 
half of a " dactyl " syllables so clearly long that they 
resist the process of clipping required by the metre. 
Longfellow is a great sinner in this regard, though 
"Miles Standish" shows a rhythmical improvement 
upon " Evangeline." Clough has utterly impossible lines 
in the " Bothie," but comparatively perfect verses in the 
brief preludes of the " Amours de Voyage." 



But difficult though it be, and remote from its class- 
ical namesake, our hexameter, a stumbling-block and a 
torture to classical scholars (e. g., to your critic), is ap- 
parently a favorite with the folk. Probably all of us 
know people who listen more eagerly to " Evangeline " 
than to any other form of verse. This fact, and the 
metre's convenient length, are important arguments in 
its favor with the translator. Even the Hellenist will 
agree, that the ignorant barbarian might better have 
indicated for him, in some way, the end of the original 
verse the actual pause in the rhythm and the sense. 
Once concede that translations have any function or use 
at all, and you must fairly face the question: What 
English rhythm, sufficiently dignified, lending itself at 
all to faithful transfusion of the thought, will also per- 
mit us to show approximately the length of the original 
verse ? 

The clashing couplets of Pope, the long lilt of Chap- 
man, and the placid iambic monotony of the blank verse 
translators, have filled the ears, and prejudice the aud- 
itor against Homer in English dactyls. Perhaps a fairer 
test may be reached on less familiar ground. Let me 
offer here (from an unpublished volume) Hesiod's open- 
ing lines: 

" Muses who came from Pieria, giving renown by your singing, 
Come ye, and tell us of Zeus, and chant ye the praise of the 

Father : 

He, who to mortal men has apportioned fame or oblivion : 
Named or nameless are they by the will of Zeus the eternal." 

The difficulties become almost insuperable in the 
elegiac stanza. Yet even there the instinct of imitation 
is strong. To lessen the strain on your type-font and 
proof-reading, let me set here, not a bit of Greek, but a 
sextette of Catullus, and ask your critic (after demol- 
ishing my faint far Saxon echo) to show us in what form 
he himself would present to a sympathetic unclassical 
reader the tender thought of the Roman friend: 

"Si quicqnam mutis gratum acceptumve sepulcris 
Accidere a nostro, Calve, dolore potest, 

Quo desiderio veteres renovamus amores, 
Atque olim missaa fletnus amicitias, 

Certe non tanto mors immatura dolori est 
Quintiliae, quantum gaudet amore tuo." 

" If there is aught, O Calvus, which out of our agony offered, 
Unto the voiceless dead grateful or welcome may be, 

When we revive with insatiate longing our ancient affection, 
When for the ties we lament, broken, that once have been 
ours, 

Though Quintilia grieve for her own untimely departure, 
Yet in thy faithful love, greater, be sure, is her joy.

SHAKESPEARE IN CHICAGO A CORRECTION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The change of two or three dates by the management 
of Mr. Daly's company, the week before last, makes 
necessary some alterations in the record of Shake- 
spearian plays as printed in THE DIAL of June 16. 
Miss Rehan's repertory of Shakespearian roles dur- 
ing this June engagement was as follows: June 17, 
"Twelfth Night"; June 19, "Midsummer Night's 
Dream "; June 20 (twice), " Taming of the Shrew." 
This reduces the performances of "Taming of the 
Shrew " from ten to eight, and makes the total number 
of Shakespearian plays presented eighty-eight instead 
of ninety. w. E. SIMONDS.

RICHARD BKINSL.EY SHERIDAN.* 

A good Life of Sheridan, such as Mr. W. 
Fraser Rae now gives us, has long been needed. 
In his Introduction to the work, Lord Dufferin, 
the great-grandson of the brilliant orator and 
dramatist, alludes to the special pleasure with 
which he read, some years ago, Mr. Rae's book 
on " Wilkes, Sheridan, and Fox," adding that 
he then determined, should opportunity offer, 
to suggest to the author that he write a com- 
plete biography of Sheridan. Presumably the 
suggestion was made ; and Lord Dufferin now 
expresses his entire satisfaction with its present 
outcome, attesting that the work has been un- 
dertaken and carried out with the cordial ap- 
proval and cooperation of Sheridan's descend- 
ants. Whatever, he says, the family could do 
to facilitate Mr. Rae's labors has been done ; 
accuracy and impartiality, tempered by that 
benevolence of treatment of which the most 
blameless stand in need and of which Sheridan 
has hitherto seldom received the benefit, being 
all that they bargained for. 

"Mr. Algernon Sheridan, the present representative 
of the house, has placed all the Sheridan papers at his 
disposal. A certain number of contemporary memoirs, 
which had not been published in Moore's time, have still 
further assisted him; while his own indefatigable energy 
in ascertaining dates, in sifting the loose statements of 
others, and in hunting rp and down through England, 
Ireland, and Scotland for any vestiges of Sheridan's 
correspondence which may have been hidden away 
among the archives of the great Whig houses, has led 
to the discovery of many new and interesting facts." 

Sheridan has hitherto fared hardly at the 
hands of his biographers. Watkins's bungling 
Life is justly styled by Lord Dufferin " a piece 
of bookmaking of the worst type "; Moore's 
narrative is perfunctory, grudging, and often 
inaccurate ; Smyth's sketch is a nestf ul of libels ; 
" Sheridiana " has probably next to nothing 
authentically Sheridian in it ; while later writ- 
ers (with two or three brilliant exceptions, such 
as Mr. Brander Matthews), drawing perforce 
on the old more or less dubious sources, have 
too seldom deviated into sense or matter of 
actual information. Nor have the playwrights 
been behindhand in swelling and embellishing 
the Sheridan myth. The most surprising at- 
tempt in this way is perhaps M. Langle's " Un 
Homme de Rien," which had a long run at the

Paris Vaudeville Theatre in 1863. The play 
reads like a parody on Charles Lever though 
it undoubtedly aims actually to portray the 
dashing and versatile author of " The Rivals." 
A synopsis of this truly Gallic production will 
serve to show the quaint general resemblance 
of M. Langle's conception of Sheridan to that 
floating vaguely in the minds of not a few of 
Sheridan's own countrymen. 

The opening scene shows a tavern-garden at 
Richmond, adjoining a race-course. The usual 
habitues " smart " people, sharpers, jockeys, 
peddlers, and so on are assembled, among 
them one " Susannah O'Donnor," who is sell- 
ing lace cuffs. A young man (appropriately 
wearing an Oxford cap and gown) reels in, calls 
for gin, and is chastely reproved for his condi- 
tion by Susannah. In his gratitude he tells her 
that his name is Richard Brinsley Sheridan, 
and that he has left his university with high 
honors ; that his plays have been rejected by 
the managers and his articles by the editors, 
that he is starving, and that he has resolved to 
drown his sorrows in punch. Susannah counsels 
prudence, and tells him to take the " waiting- 
seat " where jockeys remain until they are en- 
gaged. He does this, and presently overhears 
the Marquis " de Champrose " tell " Commo- 
dore Dunbar " that he can bring down a mayfly 
on the wing with a bullet. The Commodore 
trumps this by boasting that he used to amuse 
himself by shooting away the bowl of a pipe, 
the stem of which a Polynesian chief obligingly 
held between his teeth, and offers to back him- 
self for forty pounds to repeat the trick then 
and there, if a man can be found to hold the 
pipe. Sheridan volunteers, and, when the feat 
is performed, gets the forty pounds. The 
Commodore's jockey disappearing opportunely, 
Sheridan takes his place, wins the race, and 
receives a splendid diamond brooch. This he 
promptly hands to the " Duchess of Cardwell," 
who has torn her sleeve and asks for a pin. 
She declines to take a gift of such value, when 
Sheridan (remembering Raleigh) pulls out the 
diamond and throws it into the river, where- 
upon the Duchess relents and graciously con- 
sents to use the pin. At last Sheridan, having 
bestowed two pounds on an Irish cock-fighter 
and thirty-eight pounds on the clerk of the 
course, ends the day as poor as he began it, 
and falls asleep on the " waiting-seat," where 
he dreams of " Susannah O'Donnor." His 
fortunes rise at a bound, however, and we pres- 
ently find him a leading dramatist, with the 
Prince of Wales for his friend and the " Duch- 



12

ess of Cardwell " for his patron. Though fam- 
ous, he is still poor, and the Duchess sends him 
two thousand pounds anonymously. Guessing 
that it comes from her, he returns the money, 
and the Duchess, not to be outdone in magnan- 
imity, pitches the bills into the fire, saying : 
" You threw your diamond into the Thames ; 
now we are quits." Susannah is engaged as a 
lady's maid ; the Irish cock-fighter becomes 
Sheridan's valet ; and after a number of other 
equally stirring and probable incidents, the 
curtain falls upon Sheridan as Prime Minister 
of England and husband of Susan O'Donnor " ! * 
Such is the conception of the great Whig 
orator and statesman which the French dram- 
atist managed to draw from long current au- 
thorities. It is surely high time that a serious, 
searching, and impartial Life of Sheridan 
should be written one that may serve defin- 
itively to disengage his image from the mass of 
idle fable and party calumny which has so long 
encrusted it that, in the opinion of one author- 
ity, " the real Sheridan has disappeared for-

successfully applied himself ; and his book may 
be fairly styled a substantial addition to his- 
tory and literature. While his narrative is by 
no means to be regarded as an apologia, due 
space is given to refuting in detail and with 
irresistible cogency calumnies for which Sher- 
idan, as an active party man at a time when 
such weapons were counted legitimate in polit- 
ical warfare, was a shining mark. One notable 
story of the kind, which Mr. Rae explodes for 
all time, is Croker's familiar account (based on 
details furnished him by George IV.) of Sher- 
idan's last days. This precious tale is replete 
with revolting particulars, and represents the 
dying Whig leader lying on a truckle-bed in 
an attic, in want of the commonest necessities, 
neglected by everybody, his wife included ; and 
so on. The real facts are set forth in a letter, 
now made public for the first time, from Sher- 
idan's son Charles, who was with him to the 
last, to an elder brother then at the Cape of 
Good Hope. Charles Sheridan writes : 

" You will be soothed by learning that our father's 
death was unaccompanied by suffering, that he almost 
slumbered into death, and that the reports which you 
may have seen in the newspapers of the privations and 
the want of comforts which he endured are unfounded; 

*A compatriot of M. Langle*, M. Fr. Febre, has recently 
blundered amusingly about Sheridan. Writing from America, 
as special correspondent, he stated that soon after reaching 
New York he visited Daly's Theatre, where he saw " The 
Critic," by Sheridan. He adds : " La piece est une adaptation 
d'un ouvrage Allemand doux melange de poudding et de 
choucroute." (Le Gaulsis Aug. 18, 1895.) 



that he had every attention and comfort which could 
make a death-bed easy. . . . My mother has of course 
been thrown back dreadfully by the affliction and fatigue 
which she has gone through. She attended my father 
to the last, though ordered not to move from a sofa; 
while the painful scene lasted, the anxiety of her mind 
gave her, in spite of the pain she was in, a degree of 
strength which astonished me; but as soon as it was 
over she completely sunk under it." 

What appears to us a very just and sugges- 
tive summary of a debated side of Sheridan's 
character is contained in a statement made in 
writing by Mr. Mulock to the late Honorable 
Caroline Norton : 

" To extol Sheridan's unrivalled superiority over his 
great contemporaries (with the single exception of his 
countryman Burke) is needless. In variform power of 
mind he excelled them all, and also in independence of 
spirit. Where be most failed as a public man was in 
his Irish yieldingness to Anglo-Saxon assumption and 
arrogance. Binding himself too implicitly to an un- 
grateful party, he became (unwittingly) a splendid 
drudge without permanent pay. Much of what is called 
Sheridan's improvidence arose simply from the fact that 
his position was always higher than his pecuniary re- 
sources. He contracted debt, not in anticipation of real 
income, but on the strength of contingent expectations, 
not often fulfilled; and yet, his entire liabilities, if 
summed up, would have been wiped away by a tithe of 
the ostentatious bounty lavished on Fox and offered to 
Pitt. No one, as you justly remark, ever held out a 
helping hand to Sheridan. In his necessities he walked 
alone. . . . Sheridan was noL a dishonest man, but his 
' pride of place ' (not however with a placeman's cer- 
tainties) involved him in engagements which he failed 
to keep, and those failures, by constant recurrence, en- 
gendered a fatal familiarity with promise-breaking. 
The world past and present overflows with such in- 
stances, but on a much larger scale of indebtedness than 
poor Sheridan's." 

The fact is, Sheridan's debts were never con- 
siderable, and at his death were not much above 
five thousand pounds. This sum, however, 
was owed to a great number of people petty 
tradesmen, mainly, who had systematically 
robbed the large-hearted, easy-going Irishman 
while he lived, and who moved heaven and 
earth with their plaints against him when he 
was dead. Mr. Rae states that when Sheridan's 
affairs were strictly investigated it was found 
that for every twenty shillings which he owed, 
his creditors had received thirty. Thus these 
leeches, having sucked their victim dry, cursed 
his incapacity to yield more blood. 

That there have been few men more careless 
of the maxim " A penny saved is a penny 
gained " than Sheridan, and that the tradesmen 
he dealt with were cheerfully ready to profit by 
the fact, certain extant accounts against him 
show. For instance : 

" William Smith charged him 3 15s. for pomatum 
and hair powder from May to December, while the 



1896.]

charge for hair-cutting was os. each time and 2s. 6d. for 
dressing. In a bill of C. Weltje, dated 1784, three 
bottles of champagne are charged at the same fancy 
price as a novel in three volumes is now, that is 1 11s. 
Gd. ; a ' Perrigo pie ' is 3 3s.; strawberries at the mid- 
dle of July are charged 3s. a pottle, and cherries, when 
most plentiful, 5s. 6d. the pound." 

In fine, Sheridan seems to have paid his 
butcher, his fruiterer, his wine-dealer, his per- 
ruquier, etc., in toto about a third more than 
he honestly owed them ; yet it is mainly the 
recorded clamors of these gentry over their 
" little bills " outstanding at the time of his 
death which have moved inconsiderate biog- 
raphers to insult his memory with their misap- 
plied moralizing. For Sheridan was an essen- 
tially honest (if often culpably heedless) man, 
the life-long dupe of dishonest men ; an un- 
bought politician in an age when venality was 
the rule ; a statesman who could boast with 
truth to his wife : " My price is not on this 
earth to do otherwise than what was right and 
go straight forward." It is easy, says Becky 
Sharp, to be virtuous on five thousand a year. 
Sheridan's virtue as a public man had no such 
comfortable prop. Dependent upon his own 
exertions for a livelihood, he had counted the 
cost of being true to his convictions, saying 
once to Lord Byron : 

" It is easy for my Lord G. or Earl G. or Marquess B., 
with thousands upon thousands a year, ... to boast 
of their patriotism and keep aloof from temptation; but 
they do not know from what temptation those have kept 
aloof, who had equal pride, or at least equal talents, and 
not unequal passions, and nevertheless knew not in the 
course of their lives what it was to have a shilling of 
their own." 

Mr. Rae has told the romantic and diversified 
story of Sheridan's career well and temperately 
though perhaps his final conclusion that 
" Sheridan is the greatest dramatist since 
Shakespeare, and the greatest orator who ever 
addressed the House of Commons," is open to 
exception. His book at once takes its place as 
the standard one on the subject the one in 
which the real Sheridan, as contradistinguished 
from the half-mythical Sheridan of previous 
memoirs, is portrayed with all attainable clear- 
ness. To release this brilliant and singularly 
winning and humane figure from the region of 
largely calumnious fiction was a worthy task ; 
and Mr. Rae has done it so satisfactorily as to 
render fault-finding both difficult and ungra- 
cious. The volumes are handsomely made 
throughout, and contain a number of attractive 
portraits, several of them after originals by 
Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Hoppner.

SOME RECENT BOOKS OF TRAVEL.* 

Mr. W. A. Chanler, in his " Through Jungle 
and Desert," describes a journey taken in com- 
pany with Lieutenant von Hohnel through 
an unexplored section of Northeast Africa. 
Though the expedition was " purely in the 
interest of science," the book is chiefly a pop- 
ular description, the only very obvious scientific 
results being the fine maps prepared by Lieu- 
tenant von Hohnel. But barring some minor 
criticism, this is a well-prepared book of travels, 
and describes some important discoveries, nota- 
bly that of the Rendile, who were straight-haired 
and blue-eyed, and seemed to the author " the 
most original and interesting of all the strange 
and different peoples met in East Africa." 

" They are a tall, thin race, reddish-brown in color, 
with soft, straight, and closely cropped hair, features 
almost Caucasian in their regularity, and fierce blue 
eyes. They were clad in well-tanned robes of goat or 
sheep skin, which they threw gracefully over their 
shoulders. They were armed with short spears, or well- 
made bows of a shape very different from those I had 
heretofore seen in East Africa, the ends being curved 
outward, as in the Asiatic bow; and their arrows were 
not tipped with poison. . . . The warriors rarely car- 
ried shields; a few, however, had them. These were 
curious in shape ; some were made of woven twigs, others 
of oryx hide. . . . Nearly all the warriors painted their 
faces with a white clay, which lent ferocity to their 
appearance. They all wore their hair cut short, and I 
was much struck by the fact that it appeared perfectly 
straight and of fine texture." 

Mr. Chanler's style is clear and in general cor- 
rect, and on the whole he has given us a dis- 
tinctly valuable and entertaining work, both as 
a detailed account of travel in unexplored ter- 
ritory and as a narration of remarkable adven-

tures not only with wild men but wild beasts. 
The most troublesome of the latter were the 
rhinoceroses, which were numerous and aggres- 
sive. During one march of eighteen days more 
than a hundred of them were seen, and twenty- 
five of them charged the caravan. 

" One of these charges proved fatal. It was in the 
early morning. We were in need of meat, and seeing 
a giraffe in front I fired a shot at it from my Winchester. 
The report awoke two rhinoceroses taking a morning 
nap, not fifty feet to the left of the caravan, and in close 
proximity to the porters. In a moment loud cries of 
'Faro! Faro!' (Rhinoceros!) were heard, and looking 
back I saw my men scattering in all directions, but no 
rhinoceros. Soon from among the mass of my men I saw 
one of their number shot up into the air to the height 
of twenty feet, and presently there emerged from the 
crowd a rhinoceros with horn lowered to the earth. . . . 
Owing to the massing of my men, I was unable to shoot 
until the fleeing negroes had passed within a few feet of 
me, and the rhinoceros was almost upon them. I gave 
him a shot from my Winchester; it seemed to have no 
effect but to cause him to make a perceptible gain upon 
my men. His horn appeared to be within a few inches of 
them, when a second and more fortunate shot from my 
rifle broke his fore leg, and brought him to the ground. 
He fell but three paces from where I stood. Not know- 
ing where I had struck him, and seeing him fall, I 
thought he was dead; but when I approached him he 
rose on his hind legs and supported himself with his 
head, madly snorting all the while. Seeing he could 
not move, I left him and ran back to see what had hap- 
pened in the rear of the caravan." 

The hunting-dogs were found very useful in 
these encounters with the rhinoceros, attacking 
the huge beast with great ferocity and holding 
his attention so that the riflemen were able to 
approach and shoot at close range. The only 
animal which filled the dogs with timidity was 
the lion ; though once the whole canine pack was 
put to flight by a group of dog-faced baboons. 
The curious incident is thus described : 

" We first heard the baboons barking, and finally came 
in sight of them, running along for all the world like 
school-children on a holiday. The young ones were 
playing together, carefully watched by their elders, who 
preserved the most staid demeanor. Upon catching 
sight of them, the dogs rushed at the band in a furious 
manner. The young ones fled, but two or three old gen- 
tlemen with bushy whiskers and benignant eyes seated 
themselves upon their hams and gazed unruffled at the 
enemy. The dogs dashed on, but their barks became 
less determined, and their steps more cautious, as they 
neared, and realized the dignity of the animals they 
were to attack. These made no sign, but calmly awaited 
their charge. Haying reached a point within fifteen 
feet of them, the courage of the dogs seem to ooze rap- 
idly from them. Frightened perhaps by the steady and 
philosophic stare with which the apes regarded them, 
they turned tail, and with crestfallen manner retreated 
to the caravan." 

Another entertaining work on Africa is Mr. 
Knight's "Madagascar in War-Time," which 



narrates its author's experiences, impressions, 
and opinions as correspondent for the London 
" Times " during the late invasion of the island 
by the French. Mr. Knight had an interest- 
ing overland journey of over five hundred miles, 
from Fort Dauphin to the capital, Antanana- 
rivo, where he remained for some months, until 
after its capture by General Duchesne. The 
account is written in the direct, matter-of-fact, 
aggressive, cocksure style of the English news- 
paper correspondent. However, the work has 
considerable value and interest as an evidently 
fair and trustworthy report upon the country 
and its peoples, and also upon the status of 
Christian missions in Madagascar. Mr. Knight, 
while he concedes a considerable value to the 
work of the missionaries, is severely critical, 
and finds little to praise in the character of the 
Hovas, who are the chief converts. However, 
the Hovas quickly acquire certain aspects of 
civilization, and they show much taste for ora- 
tory and music. Mr. Knight was also favor- 
ably impressed by the school he visited, and by 
a dedicatory church service he attended. The 
Queen bore herself with due dignity at this 
meeting ; but not so the ladies of her suite. 

" The poor little maids of honor who surrounded me 
were evidently not at all comfortable. They put on 
their gorgeous Parisian attire only on great occasions, 
such as this was, and never thoroughly accustom them- 
selves to the confinement of stays, shoes, socks, and 
gloves. Several of the young ladies fidgeted about, and 
at last one, who sat immediately in front of me, could 
support the pain no longer. After glancing over her 
shoulder at me with a demure smile, she proceeded to 
take off her shoes, and then tried to unhook the back of 
her dress. She found some difficulty in doing this, and 
I was wondering whether it would be a breach of Hova 
etiquette for me to assist her in the operation, when a 
fair maiden came to her rescue." 

M. Andre Chevrillon, in his book entitled 
" In India," presents a series of letters describ- 
ing the usual round of tourist's sights, but writ- 
ten with a certain Gallic intensity and origin- 
ality which will interest many. His sketches 
are slight yet artistic impressions, are full of 
air and color, and are vivid, tense, and delicate 
in style, reminding one of M. Bourget's " Outre 
Mer." The translation appears to be well done. 
M. Chevrillon is evidently an open-minded, 
cultured Parisian, and his observations, though 
in general none too accurate and thorough, 
often show insight. Thus, this remark (p. 89) 
is full of suggestiveness : 

" Every day, for more than twenty-five hundred years, 
since Buddhism was a protest against the tyranny and 
absurdity of rites, has this race mechanically passed 
through this machinery, resulting in what mental mal- 



1896.]

formations, what habitual attitudes of mind and will, 
the race is now too different from ourselves for us to be 
able to conceive. A negro, a Terra del Fuegan savage, 
resembles us more than do these people. The negro is 
more simple than we, nearer to the life of the animals; 
but if we divest ourselves of the unstable acquirements 
of our civilization, we discover, concealed, yet alive in 
the depths of our souls, nearly all of his instincts. On 
the contrary, the Hindu soul is as completely developed 
as our own; its vegetation is no less rich, but it is en- 
tirely different. It is stupefying to see the crowd of 
ideas, according to us incoherent and absurd, that form 
the substance of their minds." 

Captain F. E. Younghusband's " The Heart 
of a Continent " is a very simple personal nar- 
rative of varied wanderings in Manchuria, 
China, Chinese Turkestan, and in the Hima- 
layas, and these mostly in little known or un- 
known territory. However, he has not suc- 
ceeded in presenting us with as valuable or 
interesting a book of travels as his achieve- 
ments and experiences would lead us to expect. 
Much of the present book is a rather uninter- 
esting, condensed, matter-of-fact itinerary ; and 
even in describing his chief exploit, the cross- 
ing of the Old Mustagh Pass, he is much too 
modest and reserved a writer to make a very 
entertaining story. On the whole, the descrip- 
tive chapter on Chitral, the suggestive chapter 
on Christian missions in China, and the chap- 
ter of " Impressions," will be found of most 
interest to the general reader. The book has 
a considerable value to the geographer, and the 
political student will find some light thrown on 
the relations of China, Russia, and England in 
the Himalayan region. There are also some 
good descriptions of wild life, from which we 
will quote a short account of the manner in 
which eagles are captured among the Kirghiz 
a nomadic tribe scattered through the open 
valleys of the Pamirs. These people use eagles 
for hawking purposes, even for securing small 
deer ; and they capture the birds by the strange 
method of riding them down. 

" When I first saw a man starting off to gallop down an 
eagle, I thought he must be mad. We had seen two eagles 
on the ground in the distance, and as soon as the Kirghiz 
caught sight of them he set off wildly after them. They, 
of course, rose on seeing him, but he went careering 
down the valley after one of them, till gradually the 
bird sank down to the ground. It was, in fact, gorged 
with the flesh of the carcass it had been feeding on, and 
could no longer fly. The Kirghiz dismounted, seized 
hold of the bird, bound his waistcloth round and round 
the body and wings till he had made it up into a neat 
parcel, and then tucked it under his arm, mounted, and 
rode back to me. He said that if it turned out to be a 
good one for hawking, he might get two hundred rupees 
for it." 

In the handsome volume entitled " On Snow- 



Shoes to the Barren Grounds," Mr. Caspar 
Whitney gives us an account which is in the 
main a reprint of his recent articles in " Har- 
per's Magazine." Mr. Whitney's trip was an 
unusually arduous one, being made in the win- 
ter ; and he writes of it in such a graphic and 
vigorous way that this volume is bound to ap- 
peal strongly to lovers of travel. For instance, 
his account of his killing of his first musk-ox 
(p. 221) is very vivid. The musk-oxen, hav- 
ing been sighted, all his party were off pell- 
mell ; but Mr. Whitney became separated from 
his Indians in the chase over the unending 
ridges. 

" As I reached the bottom of each ridge, it seemed to 
me I could not struggle to the top, even though a thou- 
sand musk-oxen awaited my coming. I was in a dripping 
perspiration, and had dropped my capote and cartridge- 
belt, after thrusting half-a-dozen cartridges into my 
pockets. Everything waltzed about me. I ran on and 
on in a sort of stupor, until, as I got to the top of a little 
ridge, I saw two musk-oxen a hundred yards ahead, and 
running easily though directly from me. I swung my 
rifle into position and dropped on my knee for surer aim. 
Heavens ! my hand shook so that the front sight trav- 
elled all over the horizon, and my heart thumped against 
my side as though it would burst. For a moment I 
rested to get my breath and then another attempt 
the fore sight for an instant held true a quick aim 
and I pressed the trigger. With what a feeling of ex- 
ultation as I saw my quarry stagger and then drop." 

" Cuba and the Cubans " gives the Cuban 
version of the causes of the present revolt, in- 
veighs with great fervor against Spanish abuses, 
and vindicates the Cubans against Spanish 
aspersions. While this book is of interest as 
an expression of Cuban patriotism, it is neither 
full nor trustworthy as a history and descrip- 
tion. For instance we have the astonishing 
information in a bare statement only (p. 429), 
that in the Cuban insurrection of the seventies 
" 200,000 Spanish privates" and "8000 Span- 
ish officers " lost their lives ! The book is rather 
poorly printed and illustrated. 

Mr. W. E. Curtis, in his work on Venezuela, 
presents a general sketch based mostly on per- 
sonal observation. It is written in a fluent and 
interesting though often careless style, and the 
tone is reportorial and superficial. The informa- 
tion afforded is sometimes patently inaccurate ; 
thus, the torpedo is called a " curious snake " 
Cp. 224), and the Trinidad Pitch Lake is said 
to furnish " the world's supply of asphaltum " 
(p. 228). We also have the amazing state- 
ment that the Orinoco " 240 miles from the 
sea" "is four and a half miles wide and 360 
feet deep" (p. 233). But in the absence of 
more thorough books on Venezuela, this volume

is of considerable value and interest. The ap- 
pendix contains the recent diplomatic docu- 
ments on the Venezuelan controversy, via.,

STOKIES AND STUDIES OF NATURE.* 

Mr. Bradford Torrey has added to his group 
of books on birds, the last of which was " A 
Florida Sketch-Book," another, the fruits of a 
summer vacation spent in the South, with the 
title "Spring Notes from Tennessee." This 
time he has visited the battle-fields of Eastern 
Tennessee, the city of Chattanooga, and the 
neighboring woods and hills. The titles of 
some of the chapters " An Idler on Mission- 
ary Kidge," " Lookout Mountain," " Chicka- 
mauga," "Orchard Knob and the National 
Cemetery," " A Week on Walden's Kidge " 
will give an idea of the scope of the book. Like 
its predecessors, it consists of somewhat de- 
tailed accounts of days spent in the search for 
unfamiliar species of birds, or familiar ones in 
new haunts ; and he who charmed us with the 
sights and sounds of " The Footpath Way " 
now charms us equally with what he saw and 
heard in spots remote from his New England 
home, but no less beautiful. To what pleasant 
paths he has lured us will be seen from his 
own words : 

" The place, besides, was alive with singing birds. . . . 
It was an exciting moment. Luckily, a man can look 
and listen both at once. Here was a fringe-tree, a noble 
specimen, hung with creamy- white plumes; here was a 
magnolia, with big leaves and big flowers ; and here was 
a flowering dogwood, not to be put out of countenance 
in any company; but especially, here were the rhodo- 
dendrons! And all the while, deep in the thickest of 
the bushes, some unknown bird was singing a strange, 
breathless jumble of a song, note tripping over note." 

To the student of nature, the book will recall 
pleasant reminiscences of his own bird-haunts, 
and afford him also new facts for comparison. 
The author has appended to the book a list of 
birds seen during this visit, both common and 
scientific names being given, with localities

where they were seen. A few of the papers 
first appeared in the " Atlantic Monthly." 

Mrs. Olive Thome Miller departs somewhat 
from her usual path in " Four-Handed Folk." 
Here she tells us about various members of the 
monkey family, several of which have been 
pets of her own or of her friends. Among the 
varieties mentioned are the kiukajou, the lemur, 
the marmoset, the chimpanzee, and the spider 
monkey. The sketches are most amusing, and 
instructive as well, for familiarity and close 
observation have shown the author many new 
facts concerning these interesting animals. We 
are equally entertained, whether we read of 
pigmy marmosets, monkeys so tiny that two 
can carry on a battle royal in the palm of one's 
hand, or of " Mr. Crowley," the famous chim- 
panzee of Central Park in New York City, who 
sat at table and ate like a human being. Sev- 
eral of the pets of whom these stories are told 
were kept in a girls' school in South America 

a country where such companions are far 
more common than here ; and the adventures 
related are sometimes quite exciting. The pets 
all received the tenderest of care, and became, 
we are told, very friendly and affectionate, 
in many cases, too much so for the owner's com- 
fort. Many mischievous pranks these favored 
" beasties " played, as the following will show : 

" A favorite plaything with the lemur was a window- 
shade. He began by jumping up to the fringe, seizing 
it, and swinging back and forth. One day he learned by 
accident that he could ' set it off,' and then his extreme 
pleasure was to snatch at it with so much force as to 
start the spring, when he instantly let go and made one 
bound to the other side of the room, or to the mantel, 
where he sat, looking the picture of innocence, while the 
released shade sprang to the top and went over and over 
the rod. We could never prevent his carrying out this 
little programme, and we drew down one shade only to 
have him slyly set off another the next instant." 

We leave the book with the feeling that we too 

for a little while would like to have a tiny 
four-handed friend ; but perhaps, after all, such 
companionship is more agreeable to read about 
than to experience. 

Mr. Slade, in his " Evolution of Horticulture 
in New England," has entered upon a some- 
what new field. His little book, which is most 
attractively gotten up, is evidently the result 
of much patient research among old archives, 
and traces the history of horticulture from the 
earliest attempts at planting in this country 
down to the present day, with its fine park sys- 
tems, botanical gardens, and horticultural soci- 
eties. There is a preliminary sketch of the 
art, showing how it had progressed in England

up to the time when our forefathers left the 
" old home," and describing the authors and 
writings whose influence was upon them when 
they first began to make gardens in the wilder- 
ness. The author quotes from many an old 
document ; and most quaint and readable are 
the accounts drawn from these source?, with 
a bloom as of the old gardens of which they 
tell. Witness the following : " This place hath 
very good land, affording rich Corne-fields, and 
fruitef ull Gardens : having likewise sweete and 
pleasant springs." Coming down to more re- 
cent times, Mr. Slade describes some of the 
chief show-places in and around Boston, es- 
tates the beauty of whose grounds has kept their 
fame alive. He also devotes some space to the 
three forms of modern landscape gardening, 
the Beautiful, or Gardenesque ; the Picturesque ; 
and the Formal, or Geometrical. " In the con- 
sideration of the gardening art," he tells us, 
" wherever it is to be employed, it must be de- 
termined how closely nature and art can be re- 
lated to each other. . . . The individual who 
truly loves nature will be guided by following 
out her schemes, which vary indefinitely, and 
he will thus be led to the exercise of original 
thought." The book closes with a brief notice 
of the work and value of the various horticul- 
tural societies of to-day. 

"Notes of the Night, and Other Outdoor 
Sketches," by Dr. Charles C. Abbott, is a group 
of delightful essays, three of which have ap- 
peared in " Lippincott's Magazine," from an 
author whose words and opinions are always 
welcome. Such a lover of out-of-doors life is 
he, such a keen observer, such a delver into 
out-of-the-way places, that we watch with much 
interest to see what he will find next to tell us. 
He never tires of giving us good advice, which 
far too few of us follow. For example : " De- 
termine beforehand whither you will ramble, 
and make an early start." "No walk is so 
successful as that in which we make a discov- 
ery." " It is a sad mistake to become only a 
reader. . . . One excellent book is the blank 
one, to be filled by our own hands "; and other 
like words. But, since we cannot all leave our 
duties in the dusty city, Dr. Abbott brings for 
our delectation the fruits of his own rambles, 
and pleasant fruits they are. He tells us of 
moonlight strolls over fields and through woods, 
in summer and winter ; of floating on the river 
under the starlit sky, with an old recluse for 
companion, identifying the notes of birds and 
insects and fish ; of adventures in a boat on a 
flooded meadow " when grass is green "; of a 



tramp " out of the beaten path," to a pictur- 
esque mill ; of an old barn, and its inhabitants, 
plant and animal ; and of many other pleasant 
saunterings, in the course of which sharp eyes 
discovered and a ready pen has described many 
beautiful and odd things which the ordinarily 
unobservant pedestrian might never see. The 
last essay in the book is on Thoreau, and in it 
Dr. Abbott defends from his friends the man 
who was in some ways our closest student of 
nature. 

" The quickest way to send the world to perdition 
would be to make all men lead professional lives; and 
the positive curse under which we now rest is that the 
absurdity is taught by parents to infants, and by teach- 
ers to scholars, that the true or best life is that of the 
preeminently learned, and that no dignity or honor or 
worthy reward of any kind comes to him who lives clos- 
est to Nature, and so most remote from the centres of 
civilization."

RECENT FICTION.* 



" The whole of this chapter may be safely 
skipped," says the author of " Kriegspiel " in a foot- 
note that occurs midway in the novel. We venture 
to say that no one who has reached the chapter in 
question will be likely to take the advice, or feel 
anything but regret at the prospect of ever finish- 
ing so fascinating a volume. Mr. Francis Hindes 
Groome, the author, is not a novelist by profession, 
and is little known to the general reader. The rem- 
iniscences of Edward FitzGerald, in " Two Suffolk 
Friends," published a year or so ago, will be remem- 
bered by those who were fortunate enough to come 
upon the book ; while another work, " In Gypsy 
Tents," has found its way to the shelves of all who 
are curious concerning the Romany folk. As for

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



" Kriegspiel," it is a Romany novel with an evident 
basis of fact and even of autobiography. We do not 
hesitate to say that it has but a single peer of its 
class, and that, it is hardly necessary to add, is 
Sorrow's immortal " Lavengro." The title is a 
mere whim, and is taken from the chimerical de- 
sign of one of the characters, who has great preten- 
sions as a wire-puller, and who aims at nothing less 
than the restoration of a Stuart to the English throne 
this, mind you, in the year of grace 1870, or 
thereabouts. But the plan thus suggested is not of 
the real texture of the narrative, which is for the 
most part concerned with happenings that do not 
transcend the limits of the possible, and with people 
who might seem commonplace were it not for the 
extraordinary power and subtlety of their charac- 
terization. Although there is a good deal of Gipsy 
life in the book, and although this is its most dis- 
tinctive feature, the interest is nevertheless richly 
varied, for we have at once a tale of mystery, a 
study of manners, a philosophical romance, and a 
very charming example of prose style. There is 
about the whole affair an indescribable mixture of 
shrewdness, geniality, and penetrating observation, 
sufficient to furnish a dozen ordinary novelists with 
their stock-in-trade, yet here lavished upon the pages 
of a single volume. The book is one of the most 
remarkable that has come to our attention of recent 
years. 

We cannot agree with Mr. Sidney Colvin in 
claiming for the " Weir of Hermiston " fragment 
the highest place among Stevenson's writings. Had 
the work been completed in accordance with the 
design sketched out by his friend and literary exec- 
utor it might, indeed, have surpassed " Kidnapped " 
and " Catriona "; but the fragment which we pos- 
sess offers nothing more than a promise or a pos- 
sibility of such preeminence. In elaboration of 
style, we think it may safely be said that the frag- 
ment equals, if it does not surpass, the best of Stev- 
enson's earlier work, but there the praise must end. 
As far as it goes, " Weir of Hermiston " is not strik- 
ingly interesting, and it is marred by digressions 
that one is strongly tempted to skip, or, at least, to 
hurry over. The element of dialect is more prom- 
inent in this tale than Mr. Stevenson was wont to 
make it, and a glossary is actually required to make 
the text intelligible. This stumbling-block, together 
with the others touched upon, makes it difficult to 
attribute to anything but personal friendship, deep- 
ened by the sense of recent loss, Mr. Colvin's hasty 
dictum concerning the rank of this book among its 
fellows. 

Mr. Black's novels are always pleasant reading, 
and now and then surprise us by the revelation of 
an unexpected strength. " Briseis " is not one of 
these exceptional examples, but simply a pretty love 
story of the approved pattern, with plenty of High- 
land scenery, and enough perplexities to keep the 
plot going. The hero is a very familiar friend, but 
the heroine is given a slight dash of originality by 
her Greek name and parentage. The author works 



in, or rather drags in, most of the puns and other 
witticisms that he has picked up at the clubs since 
his last preceding story was published, and makes 
of the whole an agreeable enough sort of pastiche. 

There is a certain earnestness about the work of 
" Mark Rutherford " that commands respect and 
compels interest, despite the heavy solemnity of its 
manner, and the narrowness of the life with which 
it deals. " Clara Hopgood " is a story of the for- 
ties, and the scene is laid in a small English town. 
The people concerned barely escape being common- 
place, and the motive that determines the course of 
the heroine at a critical juncture is almost unintel- 
ligible. Certainly, we can have slight sympathy 
with a girl who allows herself to be betrayed, and 
then refuses the reparation freely offered. The 
study of this situation has a considerable degree of 
psychological subtlety, and perhaps that was about 
all the author aimed to accomplish. 

Some ten years ago, there was published in En- 
gland, over the name of J. Freeman Bell, a novel 
entitled "The Premier and the Painter." It no?v 
appears that the name of the author was assumed, 
that the work was a joint production of two pens, 
and that the greater part of it was written by Mr. 
Israel Zangwill. An American edition of the novel 
has just been published, making it, for our public at 
least, to all intents and purposes a new work of fic- 
tion. The story is extremely difficult of character- 
ization. In the first place, it is inordinately Idng, 
and probably no human being could read, without 
generous omissions, its five hundred closely-printed 
pages. It has, moreover, all the faults of prolixity, 
confusion, bad taste, and feebleness of wit that are 
found in Mr. ZangwilPs later work, and that debar 
the writer from any very serious consideration at 
the hands of the critic. Yet it has, too, brilliant 
passages and episodes, a plot of extraordinary inge- 
nuity, and bits of characterization that would not 
have been unworthy of Dickens. It is well described 
as " a fantastic romance," for nothing more fantastic 
was ever conceived than the " tangle of tragi-comic 
situations " resulting from the confused identity of 
two men one the Prime Minister of England and 
the other a man of the people whose striking 
personal resemblance makes it possible for each to 
play the other's part for a time, until the assassina- 
tion of the pretended statesman forces the real 
statesman to forsake his disguise, and reappear in 
public life just after the consignment to the Abbey 
of what have been supposed to be his remains. The 
garrulity and riotous diction of the whole thing give 
constant offence to a reader of trained literary in- 
stinct, yet in spite of the offence, the interest grows, 
and his perseverence is rewarded by the tension of 
positive excitement as he approaches the close. It 
is a curious, and, whatever its faults, anything but a 
conventional book. 

Mr. Percy Andreae's " The Vanished Emperor " 
has a plot that recalls, in a way, that of " The Double 
Emperor " of Mr. W. Laird Clowes. In both stories, 
the Emperor of Germany is the central figure, and

in both, also, his disappearance from his capital re- 
sults in grave domestic and foreign complications. 
Mr. Andreae, however, does not kidnap his hero, 
but withdraws him from his court to marry, under 
an assumed name, the woman whom he loves, and 
who, as an ardent Hanoverian partisan, would have 
scorned a suit conducted in his own person. The 
mystery of the Emperor's disappearance is well sus- 
tained, but the network of intrigue is a little too 
complicated to be easily grasped even after the facts 
have been exposed. The story drags a good deal at 
times, and goes in for too much description and 
irrelevant detail. But it is a clever piece of work, 
written in plain straightforward style, and having 
much variety of interest. There is something fas- 
cinating about such studies in conjectural politics, 
even when they have only a moderate literary value. 

Those who have wished that Mr. Gilbert Parker 
might find in some work de tongue haleine an op- 
portunity for full display of the remarkable talents 
evinced by his shorter stories and sketches of French 
Canada may now congratulate him upon the pub- 
lication of a novel that amply justifies their expec- 
tations. " The Seats of the Mighty " is one of the 
most noteworthy examples of historical fiction that 
have come to us, even in these years that have been 
so prolific of good work in the field of romance 
based upon fact. It has for its subject the most strik- 
ing of all episodes in Canadian history Wolfe's 
capture of Quebec and the treatment of this stir- 
ring theme is simply masterly. That no doubt may 
be left as to the serious historical purpose of the 
book, the illustrations are such things as portraits of 
Montcalm and Wolfe, reproductions of historically 
important buildings, and a map of Quebec and its 
surroundings. Yet there is nothing dull or pedantic 
in the treatment, although it is everywhere under- 
lain by faithful research among old maps, prints, 
and manuscripts. " A piece of fiction which is not, 
I believe, out of harmony with fact " is what the 
author claims his book to be, and as fiction it must 
be accorded a high place. The adventures of the 
hero, an English hostage at Quebec during the years 
preceding the downfall of the French power, are as 
absorbing in their interest as any related in the 
novels of such men as Mr. Weyman and Dr. Doyle, 
while Mr. Parker knows how to give to his narra- 
tive a poetic touch that is quite beyond the power of 
these his fellow-workers in a common field. The 
characters of hero and heroine, of the fascinating 
villain Doltaire, whose intrigues cast so sinister a 
shadow upon their lives, even of such minor figures 
as Gabord the soldier and Voban the barber, are 
delineated with an art that rarely weakens ; while 
the historical portraits of such men as Bigot, Vau- 
dreuil, and Wolfe are made equally life-like. The 
story is perhaps a little too crowded with incident 
especially near the close and invention sometimes 
goes a trifle too far ; but these are slight defects in 
what must, on the whole, be reckoned a masterpiece 
of its kind. 

" Beyond the Palseocrystic Sea " is a taking title, 



but examination of the book does not show Mr. A. 
S. Morton, its author, to be possessed of a very 
remarkable literary gift. The story is of a Norse 
chieftain, forced by the victorious progress of Har- 
ald Haarf ager to seek a new home for himself and 
his followers, and finding for that purpose a land 
far to the North, within the sea that certain explor- 
ers have imagined to exist about the North Pole. 
The story is the ultra-romantic type dear to youth, 
and is told in the most amateurish way. Both sen- 
timent and language are of the nineteenth century 
rather than of the ninth. The book is prettily 
printed and bound. 

The unclean sort of fiction that has come to us in 
so great a volume of recent years, sheltering itself 
behind such convenient phrases as " realism," " the 
return to nature," and " art for art's sake," has 
evoked many a protest from the moralist ; but pro- 
tests against any marked tendency in public taste 
are apt to fall, for the time, upon unheeding ears. 
Such tendencies have to work themselves out, and 
there are happily in the present case indications of 
an approaching reaction. Better than any set pro- 
test is such a book as Mr. James Lane Allen's " Sum- 
mer in Arcady," which vindicates for art the right 
to deal with the most delicate themes, and at the 
same time shows that the power of suggestiveness 
may be used for good no less than for evil. Mr. 
Allen frankly states that the purpose of his book is 
to aid in bringing back to literature more whole- 
some ideals than have seemed of late to dominate 
the art of fiction-writing, and we should not know 
where to look for a finer statement of the question 
at issue than he has put into his brief but weighty 
preface. The words are well worth quoting. " We 
know them too well these black, chaotic books of 
the new fiction know what unhealthy suggestions 
they have courted, what exposures of the eternally 
hidden they have coarsely made, what ideals of 
personal depravity they have scattered broadcast, 
what principles of social order they have attacked, 
what bases of universal decency they have been 
resolute to undermine. There is hardly a thing of 
value to the normal portion of the race, in its clean 
advance toward higher living, that they have not in 
effect belittled or insulted ; there is scarce a thing 
that the long experience of the race has condemned 
and tried to cast off from itself as an element of 
decay, that they have not set upon with approval 
and recalled to favour." Thus runs the indictment, 
and who shall say that it is over-severe ? As for the 
author's creative programme, the essential part of it 
will serve, better than any words of our own, to ex- 
plain the book under consideration. " It is against 
this downward-moving fiction of manifold disorder 
that the writer has ventured to advance a protest 
under cover of a story a story, he is too well aware, 
that could not possibly carry with it the weight and 
measure of an opposing argument, but that should 
at least contain the taste and quality of healthful 
repudiation. To this end, and with the use of the 
weapons put into his hands, he has taken two robust

young people in the crimson flush of the earliest 
summer of life ; they are dangerously f oref athered ; 
they are carelessly reared; they are temptingly 
environed ; they are alone with one another and 
with Nature ; and Nature, intent on a single aim, 
directs all her power against their weakness. The 
writer has thus endeavored to charge this story 
with as much peril as may be found in any of the 
others even more ; he has ventured to lay bare 
some of the veiled and sacred mysteries of life with 
no less frankness than they have used, but using, as 
he hopes, full and far greater reverence ; and, never- 
theless, from such a situation he has tried to wrest 
a moral victory for each of the characters, a victory 
for the old established order of civilized societies, 
and a victory for those forces of life that hold within 
themselves the only hope of the perpetuity of the 
race and the beauty of the world." These noble 
words have the ring of absolute truth and sincerity ; 
there is nothing worth saying of the book that they 
do not convey except a few words of tribute to 
the beauty of its style, and to the warmth and vivid- 
ness with which it depicts the passion of the South- 
ern summer landscape. For the material element 
of the tale is not neglected on behalf of the spiritual, 
and the glow of the one enhances the radiance of 
the other. 

" The Quicksands of Pactolus " is a capital story, 
and it comes from a region that has not furnished 
good fiction in proportion to its possibilities. Cal- 
ifornia is known to the novel-reader through the 
work of Mr. Harte, but that is about all. Mr. 
Vachell, who now enters the field, has given us a 
picture of the intense commercial life of the Pacific 
Slope, of its unscrupulously acquired fortunes, its 
crudities, its excesses, and the promise of its new 
generation. The book is well put together, crammed 
with incident, and animated from first to last. The 
treatment borders at times, perhaps, rather too 
closely on the melodramatic to be wholly commend- 
able, and the coloring is often harsh ; but a fine ideal 
of conduct informs the work, imparting to it a 
strength that is not unmixed with sweetness. 

Readers of Mrs. Burnett's earlier novels, and 
particularly of " Little Lord Fauntleroy," will rub 
their eyes before going very far in the story of "A 
Lady of Quality." A stronger contrast could not 
well be imagined than that which exists between 
the exasperating little prig who figures in the one 
book, and the superb creature of violent passions 
who is the heroine of the other. The new story is 
a romance of the time of Queen Anne, and attempts, 
not very successfully, to depict the manners of that 
period. The stilted phraseology of the narrative 
will probably delude careless readers into thinking 
that Mrs. Burnett has succeeded in reproducing the 
form and pressure of a bygone age, but a more dis- 
criminating judgment will find an almost complete 
lack of the finer touches so necessary to the success- 
ful execution of such a task, and will be forced to 
pronounce the performance crude and the method 
coarse. The author's conception of her heroine is 



certainly bold, and the work has a vitality so 
abounding as to atone in part for its lack of sub- 
tlety. But the interest never grows deep, and the 
passion never seems wholly genuine. The manner 
of the work is theatrical rather than dramatic in 
the finer sense, and the stage mechanism is not skil- 
fully concealed. 

A little old-fashioned in style and treatment, and 
all the better for being so, the new novel with which 
Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis has broken her long 
silence brings a sense of refreshment to readers 
steeped in the feverish literary fashion of the time. 
The story of " Doctor Warwick's Daughters " is one 
of strictly domestic interest, and its charm is un- 
failing, although the grasp of character seems un- 
certain, and the leading conclusions are not as dis- 
tinctly foregone as they should be in the most 
artistic fiction. The fine things about the book are 
its elevated and wholesome moral sentiment, its 
study of society in a provincial town, and its re- 
markable success in adopting the Southern point of 
view when the scene is for a time transferred to a 
Louisiana plantation. These things are quite enough 
to make the book one of the best of the season, and 
no one will be likely to suffer disappointment who 
includes it in the course of fiction laid out for the 



summer. 



WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Origin and ^- n interesting subject has been 

development touched by Mr. Charles A. Witchell 

of bird-song*. i n The Evolution of Bird-Song" 
(Macmillan), and one not hitherto treated in a sys- 
tematic manner by any ornithologist. The author, 
one of the faithful and indefatigable corps of En- 
glish men of science, has pursued his special line of 
investigations for nearly fifteen years, chiefly among 
British birds ; but birds are birds the wide world 
over, and serve as favorably for the illustration of 
a theory in one quarter of the globe as in another. 
Mr. Witchell attacks his subject at the very founda- 
tion, beginning with the origin of the voice, which 
he believes to have been slowly developed from a 
toneless puffing expressive of anger and induced by 
the passion and struggle of combat. All life was 
mute during the long ages preceding the evolution 
of the higher vertebrates, the birds and mammals. 
Then out of a puff or a hiss arose a vocal sound, a 
battle-cry, which, valuable as a danger-signal, was 
adopted with varied intonations by the different spe- 
cies. Out of the alarm-cry grew the call-note, the 
salutation between individuals, the recognition of 
kinship, the appeal of the social instinct. Gradually 
the call-notes of birds were linked together in simple 
songs beyond which many of the species have not 
yet passed in their tuneful utterances. The cries of 
alarm and defiance, characteristic of a race or a 
species, are, according to Mr. Witchell, inherited.

release from its prison and peeping audibly mean- 
while, will cease movement and sound at the alarm- 
cry of its parent, and wait for a note of assurance 
before resuming its efforts. The perfected song of 
the bird is, on the other hand, the result of imita- 
tion. It is learned in the nest. While the helpless 
youngling is still naked and blind, it hears and re- 
members for repetition the language of love poured 
forth near and continuously by the being which 
cherishes and sustains it. Only the small birds sing, 
those that are arboreal in habit ; for, protected by 
their diminutive size and the leafy coverts in which 
they hide, they may dare speak their happiness in 
strains loud and prolonged. The larger birds are 
silent from fear of attracting fatal attention, from 
the necessity of stealth in seeking their prey, from 
the lethargy which follows the strain of conquest, 
and from the habit of feeding to repletion. Birds 
must have leisure to sing, as well as vivacity of dis- 
position. Captives in cages sing not only in the 
hope of calling a mate to relieve their loneliness, 
but because they have nothing else to do. These 
few points from Mr. WitchelPs argument give but 
a hint of the suggestiveness of a book which in de- 
tail and construction is a genuine contribution to the 
science of ornithology. 

Mr. Percy Fitzgerald has re-written 
his " Life of Laurence Sterne," which 
has continued to be the standard life 
of Sterne since its first appearance, in spite of a 
later attempt by Mr. H. D. Traill. In its new 
form (imported by Scribners), it is even more likely 
to retain its supremacy, since Mr. Fitzgerald has 
added a considerable amount of new material, some 
of which is very important to a true estimate of 
Sterne's character. The author prints for the first 
time some curious notes taken from one of the school- 
books used by Sterne at Halifax ; a lengthy letter 
written by Sterne to his unfriendly uncle, which 
seems to entirely exonerate Sterne from the charge 
of neglecting his needy mother ; some extracts from 
a journal written for the famous " Eliza," together 
with other letters of varying values. Furthermore, 
Mr. Fitzgerald has found it necessary to change 
his entire attitude toward Sterne. " I have been 
obliged," he says, "to modify the too favorable 
opinion I entertained of Sterne's life and character, 
and am constrained to admit that Mr. Thackeray's 
view harsh as it may seem had much to sup- 
port it. Yorick's Journal, which I have read through 
carefully, is fatally damaging ; exhibiting a repul- 
sive combination of Pharisaical utterances and lax 
principle. This would seem to show that Mr. Sterne 
was something more than the mere ' philanderer ' 
he described himself to be. Mr. Elwin was long 
ago constrained to adopt the same view. Indeed, it 
may be always fairly presumed that licentious writ- 
ing is almost certain to be followed by life and 
practice as licentious." The author thinks that all 
attempts at comparing and contrasting Sterne's 
methods of writing with those of men like Rabelais, 



Swift, and Fielding, is futile, because he " was so 
capricious and even fragmentary and disorderly in 
his system that comparison is impossible." He 
frankly admits that Sterne " often wrote what was 
sheer nonsense to fill his volumes," but contends 
that Sterne's fame rests upon his character creations, 
the best of which are " My Uncle Toby " and " Mr. 
Shandy "; indeed, he even prefers the latter to the 
former, as being " more piquant and attractive . . . 
because more original and more difficult to touch." 
Although Mr. Fitzgerald does not pretend to give a 
critical study of Sterne's works, many illustrative 
comments on passages in " Tristram Shandy " and 
" The Sentimental Journal " are to be found in his 
volumes. He has succeeded admirably in his attempt 
to rehabilitate Sterne. Sterne's social successes in 
London and Paris, the most characteristic features 
of his life, form the subjects of the most interesting 
chapters ; the last of these contains an account of 
Sterne's pathetic death. Mr. Fitzgerald is always 
impartial ; he shows sympathy to his hero where 
sympathy is possible, and severity where severity is 
necessary. There is a portrait of Sterne in the first 
volume ; the " Abstract of Contents " in the second 
volume, however, is not as serviceable as a good 
index. 

The longest and most eventful com- 

ed y in the 8tor y f En * land is the 

one played in the sixteenth century 
with Queen Elizabeth as the leading lady. The va- 
rious attempts to persuade the " Virgin Queen " to 
abandon her much-boasted celibacy furnish the mo- 
tive of the plot, and her dextrous juggling through 
a long course of twenty-four years is unexampled 
in the history of government. The elaborate pre- 
tence of marriage negotiations was, throughout 
Elizabeth's life, her great card, and always ready 
to be played in the interests of England. There- 
fore, the volume by Mr. Martin A. S. Hume, called 
" The Courtships of Queen Elizabeth " (Macmillan), 
though less a book of sentiment than of statecraft, 
is nevertheless both as interesting as a novel and as 
instructive as new facts and trained powers in col- 
lecting and presenting them can make it. That the 
making of England, and the establishment of Prot- 
estantism as a permanent power in Europe, were 
due mainly to the coldness, astuteness, and activity 
of Elizabeth, at the critical turning-point of Euro- 
pean history, has long been generally admitted ; but 
how masterly her policy was, and how entirely per- 
sonal to herself, has perhaps never been so plainly 
exhibited as in this book. Indeed, it is more than 
probable that she deceived Cecil and the rest of her 
advisers as to her matrimonial intentions as com- 
pletely as she did the suitors themselves, and that 
except perhaps on two occasions she never really 
meant to marry. In very many cases, neither the 
wooer nor the wooed was in earnest, and the courtship 
was merely a polite fiction to cover other objects ; yet 
to the end of her days she was able painted old 
jezebel though she was to act coquettishly the part

of the peerless beauty whose fair hand might pos- 
sibly reward the devoted admiration paid to her by 
the bright young gallants who (with tongues in their 
cheeks) sought her smiles. Capricious, even friv- 
olous, as the Queen's methods were, her main ob- 
ject to play off France against Spain, and to hold 
the balance of peace and war in Europe in her own 
hands was rarely neglected or lost sight of. To 
this end, her matrimonial negotiations were only a 
means ; and the 340 pages of Mr. Hume's hand- 
some octavo are none too many to tell the story of 
the colossal vanity which set up a tradition of per- 
ennial beauty and decreed that most of the great 
men of England's richest period of greatness should 
bow their august heads before it and accept it as a 
part of the national faith. Five portraits of the 
leading characters are presented Queen Elizabeth, 
Lord Seymour, Earl of Leicester, Duke of Anjou 
(Henry III.), and Duke of Alengon ; and the 
index and footnotes show the author's extensive and 
scholarly research. 

Mr. Henry Lauren Clinton's book 
of " Extraordinary Cases " (Harper) 
comprises sketches of certain historic 
causes celebres, in many of which the author, a dis- 
tinguished member of the New York bar, was en- 
gaged as counsel. The cases of Polly Bodine, Henri 
Carnal, Otto Grunzig, Mortimer Shay, Moses Low- 
enberg, the Forrest divorce case, the Lemmon slave 
case, the Jumel case, and the case of Millspaugh vs. 
Adams, are among the noted ones cited. The au- 
thor's treatment is naturally and properly profes- 
sional and technical rather than literary ; legal de- 
tails and the subtle and ingenious (if sometimes 
sufficiently puerile and pettifogging) shifts and 
dodges of warring counsel forming the substance of 
the narrative. The book is intelligibly written, how- 
ever, and there is a leaven of anecdotes of judges, 
lawyers, journalists, and men noted or notorious 
such as that peculiarly pestiferous blackguard, 
" Mike " Walsh, for whom the author cherishes 
rather more than a sneaking regard. "Mike" 
Walsh, political trickster, libeller, mob-orator, leader 
of one of the worst gangs of political " thugs " that 
ever cursed New York, after a long career of pic- 
turesque and successful rascality ended a " spree " 
by falling down an area and fracturing his skull 
greatly to the relief of most decent people. The 
public, thinks Mr. Clinton, somewhat unaccount- 
ably, " could have better spared a better man." To 
our notion, the cynical complacency with which the 
American public too often regard the prosperous 
knavery of such characters as " Mike " Walsh is 
one of the most disquieting and ominous signs of 
the times that political prophets have to reckon with. 
The extraordinary spectacle of bodies of taxpayers 
year after year regarding with amused admiration 
the forays on the public purse of this or that polit- 
ical cateran, is one, we believe, offered in no country 
but our own. The "smart" man is the object of 
the great national cult ; and it really seems to make 



very little difference when the " smartness " consists 
merely in so stealing as to avoid the legal penalty for 
the act. Mr. Clinton's book presents many inter- 
esting points of practice and examples of skill in 
legal fence, and should be greatly relished by mem- 
bers of the profession.

of Charles xii. addition that Mr. R. Nisbet Bain has 
of Sweden. ma( j e to the < 4 u eroes o f tne Nations " 

series (Putnams) in his life of Charles XII. Mr. 
Bain is evidently master of his subject, and of the 
historical period in which Charles played his strange 
part ; and in his volume, though it is unpretending 
and free from the impedimenta of scholarship, he 
carries along with him the judgment of the reader 
by his fairness and critical ability. This volume sup- 
plies all that the general reader will care to know 
of this meteoric genius, and traces clearly his influ- 
ence upon his unhappy country and her neighbors. 
The character of Charles XII. is one of the strangest 
that all history discloses to us, and it does not need 
the dramatic fictions of Voltaire to make the " Lion 
of the North " an attractive object for speculation 
and study. These fictions Mr. Bain clears away. 
Charles is shown to have possessed astonishing mil- 
itary genius, keen insight into political conditions, 
and many of the personal virtues that become a 
king. Nor was he the mad fool that he has been 
called, for his most foolish course of action had rea- 
son in it. The chief defects in his character 
defects that made his early successes end in dismal 
failure, and inflicted upon Sweden disaster and dis- 
grace seem to have been an invincible obstinacy, 
that persisted in its course when all circumstances 
had changed, and would not swerve to avoid evident 
disaster ; and a passionate desire for vengence upon 
all who had stood in his way. With his obstinacy, 
there was a proud self-sufficiency that led him to 
refuse the most advantageous offers and rush on in 
his blind race to deserved failure. Yet he was able 
to keep Sweden, poor and sparsely populated, in the 
rank of great powers, and to make the greatest of 
these powers suitors for his favor. 

The dote of ^ melancholy interest attaches to the 

Prof. Tuttle's fragment that has been published as 
History of Prussia. the f ourt h volume of the late Herbert 
Tuttle's "History of Prussia" (Houghton). It 
marks and emphasizes the loss to American schol- 
arship and scholarly achievement caused by his 
lamented death in the early prime of his powers. 
Professor Tuttle's grasp of multitudinous detail, and 
his power to subordinate it to the general sweep of 
his narrative, were never better shown than in this 
volume. It describes the outbreak of the Seven 
Years' War, and the events of the years 1756 and 
1757, giving spirited accounts of the great battles 
of Kollin, Rossbach, and Leuthen that master- 
piece of Frederick's genius. The brilliancy and 
solid excellence of this fragment, as well as of the 
volumes that preceded it, give Mr. Tuttle an honor-

they were appearing in serial form. Penology was 
a hobby with Dickens. Some of his most powerful

Trumble does not go into the theory of his subject,

extracts from the earlier " Culture's Garland," close 
the series. The frontispieces, many of them por- 
traits, add value to these books; and the memorial 
by Mr. Roswell M. Field, with the several introduc- 
tions by Messrs. Stedman, Hawthorne, Harris, 
Riley, Gunsaulus, Hopkinson Smith, Wilson, and 
Hale, show us the man from diverse and generous 
points of view. It is not often that an author ap- 
pears in so fair a guise to a more appreciative public. 

East and West " is the title of a 
rather handsome volume, containing 
twenty -two papers reprinted from 
various sources by Sir Edwin Arnold, profusely 
illustrated by Mr. R. T. Pritchett, and published 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The contents 
of the volume are widely diversified in theme and 
treatment, as may be inferred from their titles : 
" The Egyptian Thief," "Astronomy and Religion," 
" The Indian Upanishads," " Indian Viceroys," 



Sir Edwin Arnold's 
" East and West 
papers. 



" The Triumph of Japan," Buddha-Gya," " The 
Sword of Japan," etc. In "Aspects of Life," an 
address delivered by the author at Birmingham as 
President of the Midland Institute, the inquisitive 
reader may find set forth, with abundant and char- 
acteristic imagery and allusion, Sir Edwin's com- 
fortable, if not specially definite or definable, views 
on " man, on nature, and on human life." The vol- 
ume abounds in picturesque, if rather florid, descrip- 
tive passages, and forms an acceptable addition to 
the list of its author's published works. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Every Bird " (Bradlee Whidden, Boston) is a little 
volume prepared by Mr. Reginald Heber Howe, Jr., 
for the use of beginners in the study of ornithology. It 
relies largely for its service upon an outline drawing of 
the head and foot of the bird under notice; this is fol- 
lowed by an account of the bird's haunts, notes, plum- 
age, and distribution, compressed into a half-dozen short 
sentences. The title is a little misleading, since the 
book speaks of only a hundred and seventy-three birds, 
inhabiting the limited area of New England; but these 
include, of course, all the more familiar forms of bird- 
life of woodland, beach, and ocean. 

With the republication of the " Christmas Stories," 
the Maciuillan Co. complete their popular edition of 
the novels of Charles Dickens. There are an even 
score of volumes altogether, accurate reprints of the 
first editions with all the original illustrations. The 
valuable introductions written for each volume by Mr. 
Charles Dickens the younger are perhaps the most dis- 
tinctive feature of this edition, which may be commended 
to judicious purchasers for many reasons. 

Two fresh volumes in Messrs. Scribner's attractive 
series of books on " Women of Colonial and Revolution- 
ary Times " are " Dolly Madison," by Maud Wilder 
Goodwin, and " Eliza Pinckney," by Harriott Horry 
Ravenel. The authors have acquitted themselves cred- 
itably, the former one giving a readable biographical 
sketch of her heroine, as well as an instructive study of 
the social and home life of the period in the Old Do- 
minion; while as much may be said, mutatis mutandis, 
of Mrs. Ravenel. The volumes are exceedingly taste- 
ful in make-up, and fulfil in every way the fair promise 
of the initial one by Mrs. Earle. 

Mr. Thomas Sedgwick Steele is one of the innumerable 
host of people who take summer trips, and then feel con- 
strained to write books about them. Mr. Steele's trip 
was the regulation excursion along the coast of Norway, 
and his book is called " A Voyage to Viking-Land " 
(Estes). We must commend the exceptionally interest- 
ing and beautiful illustrations, which are made from 
photographs taken by the author, and are a real delight. 

Mr. W. H. Rideing's little book, " At Hawarden with 
Mr. Gladstone, and Other Transatlantic Experiences " 
(Crowell), which takes its title from the initial chapter 
giving an account of a visit to Mr. Gladstone at Hawar- 
den, is a collection of slight but pleasant sketches of men 
and things in the British Isles, concluding with an essay 
on " Old and New on the Atlantic." It touches lightly 
on many minor and little described aspects of life, in an 
entertaining, anecdotal way, and may serve as a very 
good book for odd half hours.

LITERARY NOTES. 

" Artists' Wives " is the latest volume in the Dent- 
Macmillan edition of M. Daudet's writings. 

Mr. Wheatley's edition of Pepys has reached its 
eighth volume, which we have just received from the 
Macmillan Co. 

From Diffluent to Disburden the New English Dic- 
tionary " takes its way in the quarterly part just pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. 

Mr. Hardy's " Wessex Tales " has been added to the 
library edition of that novelist in course of publication 
by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

" Newton Forster " and " Jacob Faithful " form the 
third and fourth volumes in the new edition of Marryatt 
now issuing from the press of Messrs. Little, Brown, 
&Co. 

Three papers on " The Adjustment of Wages to Effi- 
ciency " form the second number of the " Economic 
Studies " published by the Macmillan Co. for the Amer- 
ican Economic Association. 

The Macmillan Co. announce a translation of Mr. A. 
P. Tverskoy's "Sketches from the United States of 
North America," a work that has been compared with 
Bryce's " American Commonwealth." 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have added " The 
Autocrat of the Breakfast Table " to their Riverside 
School Library." The volume is tastefully bound in 
half leather, and the price is only sixty cents. 

Sir Joseph Prestwich, the great geologist, died on the 
twenty-third of June, at the age of eighty-four. He 
had been President of the Geological Society, and Pro- 
fessor of Geology at Oxford, and was the author of many 
works in his chosen department of scientific investigation. 
The Rev. William Elliot Griffis is at work upon a 
biography of the late Charles Carleton Coffin, and so- 
licits help in the shape of letters and personal reminis- 
cences from any of Mr. Coffin's friends whom the appeal 
may reach. Dr. Griffis may be addressed at Ithaca, N. Y. 
The Robert Clarke Co. will publish, early in July, a 
life of Nathaniel Massie, by Mr. D. M. Massie. The 
work will be, in a sense, a companion to the St. Clair 
Papers, and the two works together will give a fairly 
complete account of the beginnings of politics in Ohio. 
Mr. Francis P. Harper publishes a collection of 
Poker Stories " made by Mr. John F. B. Lillard. The 
stories are of all sorts, and most of them will be recog- 
nized as " chestnuts." Devotees of the Great American 
Game will welcome the book, while others may read it 
with some degree of interest, if not of profit. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers have published a hand- 
some library edition of " The Adventures of Huckle- 
berry Finn," which is nearly, if not quite, the best of 
the books that we owe to Mr. Clemens; and have fol- 
lowed it with " A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's 
Court." Such an edition has long been wanted. 

An important book sale, announced to take place in 
November, will be that of the library of the late Henry 
F. Sewall of New York. The collection is very full in 
old English literature (including the first folios of Shake- 
speare), in Biblical and art works, and in books relat- 
ing to printing. Messrs. Bangs & Co. will conduct the 
sale. 

Two more volumes of the " Idyls of the King," in 
the People's " edition of Tennyson, and the Book of 
Deuteronomy, in " The Modern Reader's Bible," are 



published by the Macmillan Co., who also send us a 
pretty booklet containing Arnold's essays on " A Guide 
to English Literature " and Gray, together with Mr. 
John Morley's essay " On the Study of Literature." 

A pleasant sketch of the " North Shore of Massachu- 
setts," written in approved magazine style by Mr. Rob- 
ert Grant, and illustrated by Mr. W. T. Smedley, is 
published by the Messrs. Scribners as the first volume 
of their new "American Summer Resorts " series. " New- 
port," by Mr. W. C. Brownell, " Bar Harbor," by Mr. 
Marion Crawford, and " Lenox," by Mr. George A. 
Hibbard, are soon to follow. 

Mr. W. M. Baskervill is at work upon a " Southern 
Writers " series in twelve pamphlet numbers. The first, 
devoted to Mr. Joel Chandler Harris, has been pub- 
lished, and is both biographical and critical in character. 
The subjects of the remaining numbers are to be Lanier, 
Irwin Russell, Messrs. Maurice Thompson, Cable, Page, 
Allen, and Peck, Colonel Johnston, Mrs. Preston, Miss 
Murfree, and Miss Grace King. 

Four volumes have been recently added to the " Stu- 
dents' Series of English Classics " published by Messrs. 
Leach, Shewell, & Sanborn. They are: Books I. and II. 
of "Paradise Lost," edited by Professor A. S. Cook; 
Books I., VI., XXII., and XXIV. of Pope's Homer's 
"Iliad," edited by Mr. Warwick James Price; Tenny- 
son's " The Princess," edited by Mr. Henry W. Boynton; 
and Longfellow's " Evangeline," edited by Miss Mary 
Harriott Norris. All are abundantly annotated. 

Nearly all of the leading publishers have adopted the 
pictorial poster as a means of book and magazine adver- 
tising, and large sums of money are expended yearly in 
designing and printing these gay bits of paper. Messrs. 
Lamson, Wolffe, & Co., of Boston, have produced some 
of the most artistic and expensive examples of poster- 
art that have yet appeared in this country, and their 
designs are among those most eagerly sought after by 
collectors. They are nearly all the work of Miss Ethel 
Reed of Boston. 

The " Poems of Uhland," selected and carefully an- 
notated by Dr. Waterman T. Hewett, are published in 
a neat volume by the Macmillan Co. Other German 
texts are Kotzebue's "Die Deutschen Kleinstadter " 
(Maynard), edited by the Rev. J. H. O. Matthews and 
Mr. W. H. Witherby ; Aus Herz und Welt " (Heath), 
two stories by Frau von Eschtrath and Frau Helene 
Stokl, respectively, edited by Dr. W. Bernhardt, and an 
" Elementary German Reader " (Ginn), by Dr. O. B. 
Super. 

Mr. A. C. Swinburne contributes to the London 
" Athenaeum " the following beautiful sonnet " In Mem- 
ory of Aurelio Saffi " : 
" Beloved above all nations, land adored, 
Sovereign in spirit and charm, by song and sword 

Sovereign, whose life is love, whose name is light, 
Italia, queen that hast the sun for lord. 
" Bride that hast heaven for bridegroom, how should night 
Veil or withhold from faith's and memory's sight 
A man beloved and crowned of thee and fame 
Hide for an hour his name's memorial might ? 
" Thy sons may never speak or hear the name, 
Saffi, and feel not love's regenerate flame 

Thrill all the quickening heart with faith and pride 
In one whose life makes death and life the same. 
" They die indeed whose souls before them died : 
Not he, for whom death flung life's portal wide, 
Who stands where Dante's soul in vision came, 
In Dante's presence, by Mazzini's side."

almost dramatic directness, and when our attention is taken from the 
actors it is only for a moment, in order to make us see the glories of

J. B. Lippincott Company, in connection with the London publishers, announce the issue of the above famous poem, in edition de luxe

PARIS DAYS AND EVENINGS. By STEWART HENRY. With 12 Illustrations. Large 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $2.50. 
CONTENTS : Phases of Life. Letters and Colors. Opera and Theatre. The Latin Quarter. 

Stewart Henry has lived in Paris with wide-open eyes and a responsive heart, and these have brought him intimate views, such as only 
one who dearly loves his subject can set forth. 

LONDON STREET NAMES. Their Origin, Signification, and Historic Value, with divers Notes and Observations. 

By F. H. HABBEN, B.A. 12mo, cloth, $3.00. 

Mr. Habben has had the extreme industry and antiquarian knowledge to dig up the origin of every London street name, and a more sug- 
gestive book than his researches would be hard to find. For the tourist who wants a book to read on his voyage over, or to carry with him 
through the thronging city, there can be nothing better. The volume is accordingly handy in shape and substantial in quality, and the index- 
ing is all that could be desired.

Party. A new Fantastic Romance by the author of "The Fight at Dame Europa's School." 12mo, cloth, ornamental, $1. 

Never has Anstey nor Gilbert produced a more extravagant tale of impossibilities that seem possible than has the author of " The Fight 
at Dame Europa's School " in this skit entitled " Venus and Cupid ; or, A Trip from Mount Olympus to London." Throughout the entire nar- 
rative there are laughable eddies and cross-currents of wild humor which will keep the reader who loves fun made by incongruity in a frenzy 
of laughter.

New Book by Sir JOHN LUBBOCKNow Ready: 

THE SCENERY OF SWITZERLAND, 

And the Causes to which it is Due. 

By the Right Hou. Sir JOHN LUBBOCK, Bart., M.P., F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D. With numerous Plans and 

Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

**Sir John Lubbock's volume on " The Scenery of Switzerland " comes out appropriately at a time when English and 
American travellers are beginning to think of seeking the invigorating air of the high Alps. It will no doubt become a fav- 
orite companion to thousands of travellers during the season, and be hardly less welcome at other times of the year as a 
reminder of past pleasures, or, to those who have not yet visited Switzerland, as a delightful foretaste of what is to come. 
The book is scientific in character, but the subjects are handled in the popular style which so many readers have learned to 
associate with Sir John Lubbock's name. The titles of a few chapters will give an idea of the contents : The Geology of 
Switzerland, The Origin of Mountains, Snow and Ice Glaciers, Valleys, Lakes, Action of Rivers, Influence of Strata upon 
Scenery, The Valais, Jura, Bernese Oberland, etc.

THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 

The youngest of the great universities has at 
last grown old enough to have a special cele- 
bration in commemoration of a rounded period 
of its existence. The period is only a lustrum, 
to be sure, and matters had to be stretched a 
little to justify even a quinquennial celebration, 
but if we add to the four years that the Uni- 
versity has been in running order the prelim- 
inary year of building and organization, we get 
the full tale of five. For the first time in the 
history of the institution, also, there was grad- 
uated a class of students who had taken four 
years' work in the University, and this fact was 
in itself sufficient justification for a little extra 
ceremony. 

The programme for Convocation Week was 
one of varied interest. A great tent was put 
up on the campus for the larger gatherings of 
spectators, and a still greater one would have 
been filled had it been provided. The Convo- 
cation orator was Dr. George Adam Smith, of 
Glasgow, and his address was one of the ablest 
to which the University has ever had the pleas- 
ure of listening. The formal opening of the 
Haskell Oriental Museum was one of the leading 
events of the week, and was made the occasion 
of an eloquent address by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch ; 
of a representation of the synagogue service of 
the times of Christ, conducted in the Hebrew 
tongue and in Oriental costume by the Semitic 
Department; and of special conferences on 
Oriental subjects, with addresses by Dr. D. G. 
Lyon of Harvard, and Dr. A. V. Williams 
Jackson of Columbia. While the completed 
Oriental Museum was thus dedicated, the cor- 
ner stones were being laid of the Hull Biolog- 
ical Laboratories, four in number (zoology, 
botany, physiology, and anatomy), and the prin- 
cipal address upon this occasion was made by 
Professor George L. Goodale of Harvard. The 
celebration ended on the Fourth of July, with 
the formal presentation of a United States flag, 
the gift of the First Kegiment of Illinois Infan- 
try to the University, by Colonel Henry L. 
Turner, and with a scholarly oration on " The 
Conditions and Prospects of Democracy," de- 
livered by Professor Bernard Moses of the 



32 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



University of California. This oration was of 
the sort that jingo newspapers call pessimistic, 
which means that it was a serious and sober 
discussion of the grave problem with which it 
dealt the kind of thing, in short, of which 
our excitable young men and women, with their 
tendency to the display of an unbalanced en- 
thusiasm, are most in need. 

An interesting incidental feature of this 
quinquennial celebration was provided by the 
presence of the founder of the institution. Mr. 
Rockefeller had often been urged to make a 
personal inspection of the University which his 
munificence has brought into existence, but had 
hitherto declined all such invitations. At last, 
however, he consented to come, and it need 
hardly be said that the reception accorded him 
was of the most enthusiastic nature. He 
marched in the Convocation Procession, and 
sat in the tent during the programme of exer- 
cises, listening, among other things, to the Presi- 
dent's airy enumeration of the millions that 
were still wanted to meet the more pressing 
needs of the University. He was even pre- 
vailed upon to make a few remarks of his own, 
and scored one very neat point upon his audi- 
ence. Enthusiasm rose to a frantic pitch when 
he casually remarked, " This is only a begin- 
ning," and promptly subsided with the conclu- 
sion of the sentence, " You will do the rest." 
But he must have taken peculiar satisfaction in 
viewing the noble group of buildings, and the 
imposing group of men and women in scholastic 
garb, resulting, for the most part, from his gen- 
erous initiative, and all testifying to the power 
for good that it rests with a man of wealth to 
exercise. 

So young a university could not fail, upon a 
festal occasion like this, to exhibit startling 
contrasts. The newness of the institution, as 
exemplified by the unfinished condition of the 
campus, the makeshift tent erected for the cele- 
bration, the brass band requisitioned for the 
purpose, and the restive self-consciousness of 
the men in their unaccustomed raiment, was as 
apparent as, let us say, the newness of the Ger- 
man Empire to a sojourner in Berlin during 
the seventies. Neither an empire nor a univer- 
sity, with the stamp of the mint still sharply 
impressed upon it, can put on the trappings 
and the suits of antiquity and feel wholly at 
ease, or so wear them as not to arouse in the 
philosophical observer some sense of incon- 
gruity or imperfect adjustment. To see the 
youngest of universities thus trying to outdo 
the oldest in the matter of form and ceremonial, 



particularly under such distressing external 
conditions as obtain at Chicago, is a matter for 
solemn reflection ; and the sight would give 
pause to Mr. Herbert Spencer, making him 
wonder at the vitality of the ceremonial in- 
stinct. The very forms and symbols that are 
so impressive when they are really survivals, 
and consecrated by the unbroken tradition of 
centuries, become little more than childish 
toys when they are deliberately assumed for 
the sake of the dignity imagined to go with 
them, and thus fail in large measure of the 
effect desiderated. 

The true dignity of a university is not to be 
sought in features which, even if cherished upon 
historical grounds, are still only incidental to 
its life. The spirit of the institution, and the 
seriousness of the aims which it pursues, are 
the real index of its significance. The Univer- 
sity of Chicago has shown, as the Johns Hop- 
kins University showed twenty years earlier, 
that age is not essential to an educational insti- 
tution of the highest type. The University of 
Chicago is to-day a great influence for good, 
because, with large property and substantial 
equipment, it enlists the services of a distin- 
guished body of scholars in its teaching, and 
attracts to its walls a great number of earnest 
young people in search of culture. It is also a 
power for good because it has espoused a large 
conception of the university ideal, its tentacles 
reaching out to all classes of the community in 
which it has taken up its work. We think of 
the octopus as a malignant and destructive 
creature, but there is no reason why the name 
should bear associations of this kind alone. 
The University of Chicago, with its systems of 
extension -work and correspondence - teaching, 
its efforts to raise the standards of lower edu- 
cation throughout the surrounding country, its 
cooperation with the work of public and pri- 
vate schools, its public lectures and expanding 
press, its missionary work done in settlements 
and experimental schools of pedagogy, is fas- 
tening itself with clear-sighted and beneficent 
energy upon the civic life of the community 
with which it is associated, and in calling it an 
octopus we do no violence to correct metaphor. 
That its reach may become greater and its grasp 
more firm with every year of its life must be 
the wish of everyone who has at heart the inter- 
ests of culture and civilization. It is, indeed, 
as the founder remarked, only a beginning that 
has thus far been made, but it is a good be- 
ginning, and one that promises much for the 
future.

The ravishment is over. Love her fill 
Has taken; slowly, slowly, all the day, 
She wanders up and down yon sunny way, 
Hands folded, silent. But the robin, still. 
He sings; and, in the willows by the mill, 
The catbird tricks it yet 'twixt squeak and lay. 
Come are the yellow lilies and full clover, 
The oxeyes and stanch yarrow; there 's a hum 
In the elder bushes, and some plucky rover 
Pipes from the milkweed. But with surfeit dumb 
Are Love's own lips: the ravishment is over.

LITERARY CRITICS AND LITERARY 
CRITICISM. 

What is literary excellence? To whom shall we 
look with respect and confidence as conservators of 
all that is best in contemporaneous literature? If 
the foregoing questions are answered comprehen- 
sively, we shall meet satisfactory definitions of the 
true literary critic, and of painstaking and conscien- 
tious criticism. Undoubtedly, a just criticism is the 
intelligent expression of a just literary judgment. 
Fulsome praise and biting sarcasm are no part of 
the language of a critical judgment. These quali- 
ties may come from the smallest and the narrowest 
of intellects, and are usually worthless in the world 
of letters. They absorb the prejudices and eccen- 
tricities of their environment, and put into definite 
literary form the baser feelings of the human mind. 
They do not seek the pure atmosphere of the higher 
life. They invest in none of the lofty sentiments 
which befit the true man. 

The critic of contemporaneous literature must be 
in touch with his age. It will not be enough for 
him simply to know a truth when he sees it. He 
must also know the conditions which have evolved 
the truth, or have made such evolution possible. He 
must be able to judge relatively as well as abstractly. 
His success will largely depend upon his ability to 
grasp present-day problems as they are presented 
for his clearer literary vision. It is not necessary 
for him to take a position in the clouds in order 
that nothing of an earthly nature should obscure 
his view. Rather let him stand among his fellows, 
in order the better to catch the inspiration of the 
hour, and to form an intelligent estimate from that 
point of view, so essential and so indispensable to 
the true critic of contemporaneous literature. 

Literary excellence must prevail whenever and 
wherever criticism is taken out of the wallowing 
mire of literary mediocrity and commonplace, and 
transferred into the pure and clear air of a broad 
and generous culture, of a lofty ideal, and of intelli- 
gent and just literary opinions. Literature seeks to 
secure and retain the approval of those high-minded 
persons whose judgment is founded in reason and 



justice, who delight to see real literary merit reach 
the heights of enduring fame. So, too, literature 
desires that the literary sycophant who praises with- 
out reason, and the literary cynic who condemns 
without justice, should alike be held up to public 
scorn, ridicule, and abhorrence.

JOURNALISTIC RETRIBUTION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

" The Bookman " for July takes account of my recent 
remarks on " who was given a seat " (THE DIAL, May 16) 
in a characteristic fashion : it ignores my name and falsi- 
fies my argument the two familiar weapons of jour- 
nalistic retribution. It charges me with defending the 
English locution by (1) Latin and Greek usage; and 
(2) exceptional English error. In the twenty lines of 
my DIAL letter I briefly defend the locution by (1) the 
authority of grammarians, who are unanimous; (2) his- 
tory ; (3) universal usage of English writers and speakers 
not sophisticated by misapplied logic or narcotic predi- 
lections and prejudices Latin and Greek being cited 
only to illustrate the pervasive naturalness of the con- 
struction even in synthetic languages. Nobody knows 
better than the editor of " The Bookman " that I am 
guiltless of his charges, and his adjectives, and his hypo- 
thetical characters. CASKIE HARRISON.

WORDS, WORDS, WORDS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Professor Dodge says, in your issue of June 16, that of 
five quotations in my article on " Shakespeare in Lexi- 
cography," two are incorrectly given (though this is not 
what he means), " the passage from Cymbeline ' being 
from the third instead of the fourth scence of the first 
act, and the same being true of the extract from Meas- 
ure for Measure.' " The first of these two passages is 
in the third scene in the Riverside (White's) Shake- 
speare, but in the fourth scene in the Leopold edition, 
and the other is in the fourth scene in both these edi- 
tions. 

Another critic thinks a knowledge of Schmidt's 
" Shakespeare Lexicon " would have prepared me for a 
more intelligent discussion of the vocabulary of Shake- 
speare, and is surprised to see such an article as mine 
with no mention of that lexicon. My article was just 
what it was meant to be, and reference to Schmidt was 
not needed. I know his work well enough to assent un- 
reservedly to my critic's estimate of it. It may be pos- 
sible that " great " in " of great admittance " meant 
" great people," but this merely shifts the ellipsis. "Ad- 
mittance " certainly means what I and Schmidt and my 
critic say it means, whether the ellipsis be before or 
after it, which is uncertain. Timon's apostrophe is cited 
in favor of " that which separates " as a meaning of 
divorce " O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce." 
Is this not metonymic or elliptical for " dear instrument 
of divorce," and is not the real sense of the word that 
which Shakespeare had in mind? I still believe it is, 
and that it is not advisable to define an effect as a cause.

A BRITISH DIPLOMAT OF NAPOLEON'S 
TIME.* 

Historical students will find in the Paget 
Papers useful clews to the tangled skein of Con- 
tinental politics during the changeful period 
extending from a little before the fall of Robes- 
pierre, July 27, 1794, down to some four 
months after the Peace of Tilsit, July 7, 1807. 
The volumes contain the diplomatic correspond- 
ence of Sir Arthur Paget, edited by his son, 
Sir Augustus B. Paget, who supplies a brief 
sketch of his father's public career, together 
with some elucidatory matter, historical and 
personal. Sir Arthur Paget played a promi- 
nent part in the shifting political drama of 
which Bonaparte was the protagonist. One of 
the ablest diplomatists of his time, he was ac- 
tively engaged during the period covered by 
the correspondence in guarding English inter- 
ests at such centres as Berlin, Munich, Vienna, 
and Palermo ; and his letters present a pretty 
continuous record of the development of affairs 
as seen through British eyes intensely British 
ones, be it added, for it is clear throughout that 
no Briton was ever more firmly fixed in the 
national faith that Nature, in forming the En- 
glishman, had fairly outdone herself and out- 
stripped her own ideal, than was Sir Arthur 
Paget. As his son gravely puts it, " No one 
was ever more earnestly impressed with the 
superiority of British institutions over those of 
any other nation, or more thoroughly appre- 
ciated the privilege of having been born an 
Englishman . . . than Sir A. Paget." 

Sir Arthur Paget, third son of Henry 
(Bayly) Paget, who was in 1784 by Patent 
created Earl of Uxbridge, was born January 
15, 1771, and died July 26, 1840. He was 
educated at Westminster School a rather 
severe ordeal, as we gather from the following : 

" Those were rough days for boys at public schools, 
the system of tyranny and bullying of the small boys by 
their seniors having been frequently revolting and atro- 
cious. I remember my father mentioning that his 
brother Edward had undergone such a thrashing from 
one of the bigger boys that it was for some time doubt- 
ful whether he would recover from the injuries inflicted 
upon him, but that he absolutely refused, either at the 
time or afterwards, to reveal the name of his assailant." 

* THE PAGET PAPERS. Diplomatic and other Correspond- 
ence of the Right Hon. Sir Arthur Paget, Q.C.B., 1794-1807. 
With two Appendices, 1808 and 1821-1829. Arranged and 
edited by his son, the Right Hon. Sir Augustus B. Paget, 
G.C.B. (Late Her Majesty's Ambassador in Vienna). With 
Notes by Mrs. J. R. Green. In two volumes, with 24 por- 
traits. New York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



From Westminster Sir Arthur went to Christ 
Church College, Oxford, whence he proceeded 
in 1790 to the Continent, with the view of learn- 
ing foreign languages, and of otherwise equip- 
ping himself for the diplomatic profession. A 
letter written to him at this period by Lord 
Henry Fitzgerald, brother of Lord Robert 
Fitzgerald who was then secretary of the Em- 
bassy at Paris, touches interestingly on current 
events at the French capital. 

" All has been confusion again at Paris, owing to the 
folly of the poor King, who took the Sacrament Easter 
Sunday from one of the nonjuring clergy all the heads 
of which he has harbored and protected in his palace. 
This instantly gave a general alarm, and the cry was 
that the King had deserted his people, et qu'il etait 
devenu aristocrat, that his conduct was insincere. In 
such a ferment was all Paris that the King attempted to 
go to St. Cloud, and was actually in the carriage with 
the Queen. He was prevented by the mob, and sat in 
his carriage two hours determined not to get out. Upon 
this La Fayette told him he could not answer for any- 
thing unless the King ordered him with the militia of 
Paris to fire. This the King would not hear of, and 
La Fayette was told by his soldiers in plain terms that 
they would not obey any such order, supposing it had 
been given. The Queen attempted to harangue the mob, 
when she was saluted with, ' Tais-toi, coquine, ce n'est 
pas a toi de donner des ordres id ! ' La Fayette, enraged, 
resigned, and the King was obliged to give up the jour- 
ney. The next day he went to the Assembly, made a 
fine speech, but has not quite regained the confidence 
hitherto reposed in him of his being a friend of the 
Revolution though he has discarded all the nonjuring 
clergymen and aristocratic officers of his household. 
This transaction, foolish on his part, and really out- 
rageous on the part of the people, has cost the Royal 
Family, my brother says, many tears and dreadful mo- 
ments of anxiety." 

Late in 1791, or early in 1792, Sir Arthur 
was temporarily employed in Mr. Ewart's Mis- 
sion at Berlin, whence he was presently trans- 
ferred to St. Petersburg as Secretary of Lega- 
tion under Lord Whitworth. In 1794 he 
returned to Berlin, where he acted for several 
months as Charge d'affaires during the absence 
of the temporary envoy, Lord Malmesbury. A 
letter of this date from Mr. Paget to Lord St. 
Helens, Ambassador at the Hague, regarding 
the proposed marriage between the Prince of 
Wales (afterwards George IV.) and Caroline 
of Brunswick, may be quoted as showing the 
promising perspicacity and initiative of the 
young diplomatist (he was then twenty-three), 
who evidently used all his address to prevent 
the ill-starred match. After some cautious pre- 
liminary fencing, Mr. Paget goes on to say : 

" I will not conceal from you then, My Lord, that this 
intelligence [of the impending treaty of marriage] has 
given me the most serious uneasiness, and it is palpable 
that the choice which (it appears) has been made is the 
cause of it. I will not now take upon me to mention who

have been the promoters of this union, but this I will 
venture to say, that it has been undertaken by persons, 
who have had an interest, not perhaps in making this 
particular choice, but in preventing its having fallen 
elsewhere. Obvious reasons point out the necessity of 
not committing to paper the received character of the 
Princess (Caroline) above alluded to, and I am sure that 
your lordship is too well acquainted with it to make 
that necessary. I cannot, however, avoid saying this 
much, that I conceive it to be more calculated to ensure 
the misery of the Prince of Wales, than promote his 
happiness, and at a future period the nation's welfare." 

Concluding, Mr. Paget (forgetful evidently of 
the precept touching the casting of pearls be- 
fore swine) takes upon himself to suggest a 
bride worthier of the chaste patron of Beau 
Brummell and putative husband of Mrs. Fitz- 
herbert, than the shady Caroline of Brunswick : 
" It will immediately occur to your lordship that the 
Princess I allude to is the Princess Louisa of Prussia 
a woman in every respect worthy of so great an alliance, 
inferior to few as to the beauties of her person, and 
endowed with an understanding which in every scene of 
life is calculated to distinguish her. . . . What I have 
said will sufficiently prove my entire aversion to this 
projected marriage, and if I could flatter myself that it 
would appear to you in the same point of view, I should 
feel perfectly secure that the representations you may 
have it in your power to make upon the subject would 
be attended with the success they deserve. . . ." 

Unfortunately, Mr. Paget's wise interposition 
came too late. Lord St. Helens replies : 

" Lord Bacon advises us to ' be wary in our dealings 
with kings and princes, for that their reason (when they 
have any) is a different kind of reason from that of 
other men,' and the truth of this maxim is without 
doubt most strongly confirmed by the courtship to which 
you allude; since tho', in a case like this of a pretty 
woman with an indifferent reputation, a man might nat- 
urally enough be so much captivated by the sight of her 
person as to be willing to marry her notwithstanding the 
stain on her reputation, it is in truth utterly inconceiv- 
able that he should fall in love with her reputation only, 
and without having seen her person. I am afraid, how- 
ever, that the engagement is too far advanced to be now 
dissoluble, and therefore we must endeavor to make the 
best of it, and to hush up all bad stories. The other 
young lady you mention is indeed a jewel of the very 
first water, and without a flaw." 

How worthy the future George IV. (whose use- 
fullest recorded deed on this earth is the inven- 
tion of a shoe-buckle) was of this " jewel of the 
very first water," the world knows. An epistle 
of his, of 1799, to Mr. Paget contains some inti- 
mations of his then pursuits and character, and 
of his qualifications for the station to which it 
had pleased Providence in an unusually inscru- 
table mood to call him. After a rambling, pre- 
amble, in which he complains that a letter of 
his " of sixteen or eighteen pages" has remained 
long unanswered (unread, one fancies he might 
have said with equal truth), "Prince Florizel " 
concludes, in sprightly vein : 



" After this long prosing sermon, which I hope you 
will forgive me for, my dear Arthur, though you may 
rate it a bore, I must write you in order to extort a 
smile before I conclude some little account of Chig [a 
Mr. Chester, a boon companion of (he writer]. He ar- 
rived on the Saturday in the last week, from Ireland, on 
Sunday he dined with me and a party to commemorate 
how happy we used to be with you last year, and hope 
to be for many years to come, the party were, viz., Bath- 
urst, Brummell, Chig, and Bob Mongomery. After the 
first Glass after dinner every Round was a Bumper to 
you in the very best Claret I had; Chig thought it too 
weak. Of course stronger, the old Queen's House Claret, 
was produced for him which he swore was the b-pup- 
pup-pup-pest Cha-a-a-teau Margeau he had ever ta-a- 
asted and tumbled about ten o'clock smack on his face, 
and was obliged to be carried off between two servants. 
The rest were bad enough, God knows, except myself, 
though my every Glass was a Bumper to your health, I 
can safely swear I never flinched one, dear Arthur, and 
you well know I am not even upon indifferent occasions 
a Shirker. Since that day, the old Girl* has never 
ceased being tipsy twice a day, first at dinner and on 
but after supper for she always makes a regular sup- 
per first and a couple of Bottles of iced Champagne, 
after a couple of quarts of Beer which she calls, you 
know, a Swig of Beer, has completed about six in the 
morning the old Gentlewoman since she has been with 
us here." 

The widespread horror of " French principles," 
then (thanks largely to Burke) supposed to 
have reached their true concrete expression in 
the Jacobin excesses at Paris, but no more to 
be finally condemned for those excesses than the 
Reformation is to be repudiated on account 
of the Bedlamite doings of the followers of 
Thomas Miinzer and John of Leyden, shored 
up more than one rotten throne of the period, 
and none more so than that of the writer of the 
above elegant and coherent epistle. 

Sir Arthur Paget remained at Berlin till 
early in 1795, when he proceeded to England, 
remaining there until 1798, and entering Par- 
liament as member for Anglesey. In 1798 he 
was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Min- 
ister Plenipotentiary to the Elector of Bavaria, 
and two years later to the Mission at Palermo, 
where he resided till May, 1801, when he went 
to Vienna as successor to Lord Minto, remain- 
ing until 1806. In 1807 he was sent on a spe- 
cial embassy to the Dardanelles, to persuade 
the Turks to break with France and conclude 
peace with England and Russia, Count Pozzo 
di Borgo representing Russia. The Peace of 
Tilsit being concluded in the interim, the joint 
negotiations with the Turk were broken off 
Sir Arthur waiting, however, with character- 
istic tenacity for several weeks off Tenedos in 
the hope of inducing the Porte to name a Plen-

ipotentiary to treat with him alone. With this 
Embassy Sir Arthur Paget's diplomatic career 
came to an end. He married, in 1809, Lady 
Augusta Fane, daughter of the Earl of West- 
moreland, and seems to have passed the remain- 
der of his life chiefly in yachting, having pur- 
chased, with a view to that end, a place called 
Hamble Cliff, on the banks of Southampton 
Water, and, observes his son, with some feel- 
ing, " A more ill-chosen spot for yachting pur- 
poses, if I may say so, with all the respect, affec- 
tion, and veneration I cherish for my father's 
memory, could hardly have been selected." 

Notable among Sir Arthur's correspondents 
are Lords Grenville, Harrowby, Hawkesbury, 
Malmesbury, St. Helens, Wellesley, Whit- 
worth, Sir G. Leveson Gower, Admirals Keith 
and Collingwood, Mr. Fox, Mr. Canning, 
Counts Stadion and Pozzo di Borgo, etc. Diplo- 
matists, in those days of slow and difficult com- 
munications and rapidly shifting events and 
policies, were charged with great powers and 
laden with heavy responsibilities, a more than 
average share of which fell to the lot of Sir 
Arthur Paget. He acquitted himself credit- 
ably at times brilliantly ; and his correspon- 
dence throws some new light on the political 
transactions of the time, and especially on the 
attitude of the minor courts. His letters are 
necessarily for the most part somewhat formal 
and businesslike, and contain little of the chit- 
chat which appeals to the taste of the general 
reader. The volumes are handsomely made, 
and contain a liberal number of well-executed 
portraits.

GLEANINGS IN AMERICAN FOLK LOBE.* 

Mrs. Bergen's book on " Current Supersti- 
tions " is the fourth volume of the " Memoirs of 
the American Folk -Lore Society." Quaint 
expressions, terse sayings, curious superstitions, 
apparently unmeaning practices of the past, 
linger tenaciously, even into the busy present 
of bustling America. No intelligent reader is 
so far removed from them as not to find inter- 
est in hearing the old ideas expressed again. 
We all heard signs and knew charms and tried 
" projects " when we were young, and to be 
reminded of them is refreshing. This interest

dition of English-Speaking Folk. Edited by Fanny D. Ber- 
gen, with Notes and an Introduction by William Wells Newell.

and refreshment will be all that many readers 
will derive from " Current Superstitions "; to 
the student, however, will come much more. 
For him there are here bits of past philosophy, 
much of savage psychology, shreds of rude reli- 
gious belief. 

Mrs. Bergen does not pretend to have ex- 
hausted the material. The book can make no 
claim to fulness. A rich collection of plant and 
animal lore is reserved for another publication. 
But even of the kind of material presented, we 
have but a fraction. The public will be disap- 
pointed in its small amount ; but it is well that 
the collection is published now and in its incom- 
plete state. The material is fairly varied ; Mr. 
Newell's introduction is suggestive ; the matter 
is carefully classified and arranged. While 
Mrs. Bergen might have been gratified by the 
delay in publication until double the amount 
of material had been secured, the appearance 
of the book in its present form will probably 
call out four or five times its mass for future use. 

Each item is numbered. Fourteen hundred 
and seventy-five numbers are presented. Many 
of them are simply local variants of others. 
While the book aims to be English lore, some 
German and negro superstitions appear. If we 
suppress slightly differing variants and this 
foreign matter we reduce the bulk probably by 
one-half. It seems as if it would have been 
better not to separately number each variant of 
a theme, as if it were a really new idea ; of 
course all variants should be presented, but 
they should hardly be given the prominence of 
independent themes. 

The presentation of " projects " is well done. 
" Projects " are the popular attempts to divine 
the future. While " now made in a sportive 
manner and only with partial belief," they are 
real broken-down remnants of once serious cer- 
emonies. Naming apple-seeds and counting 
them out to find the future is wide-spread. 
No. 170 describes a curious project tried in 
New Hampshire which is quite like Cherokee 
bead-conjuring. " An apple seed was placed 
on each of the four fingers of the right hand. 
They were named, and the fingers so worked as 
to move slightly. The seed that stayed on 
longest indicated the name of your future hus- 
band." A sport among white people, such con- 
juring is in earnest among the Cherokees. To 
count buttons for one's fortune is child's play, 
but until recently an important Christian de- 
nomination left all important decisions to the 
lot. No. 241 runs : " Write names on three 
pieces of paper, throw them up in the air (in 



1896.]

the dark); feel for one, put it under the pillow, 
and in the morning look for the name of the 
man you are going to marry." Ridiculous, but 
the great Goethe is said to have left a life deci- 
sion to the fall of a knife. School children 
often write two names, one of a boy and one of 
a girl, upon paper and then cancel the letters 
common to them ; those left are counted out 
with the words " love, friendship, indifference, 
hate (cf. 244), to find the feeling existing be- 
tween the two parties. Underneath this there 
must lie a queer mixture of ideas among which 
must be these two belief in beings destined 
for each other, conception of mystic power in 
names. 

The world will ever judge men by appear- 
ances. To physiognomize is natural. The child 
with some unfortunate characteristic will be 
noted and some comment made. " Give a dog 
a bad name and hang him." The comment or 
the prediction based upon the peculiarity is 
likely to be justified. The poor child, from 
nagging, constant repetition of the unpleasant 
saw, and the popular disfavor, has much against 
him. Fortunately sufficient difference, in the 
meanings attributed to such peculiarities, exists 
to rob these signs of much of their bad result. 
Thus while small ears show stinginess, they also 
indicate truthfulness. " If the eyebrows meet, 
one is ill-tempered." This peculiarity is so 
generally connected with unreasoning dislike 
that its presence is a real misfortune. What 
inducement has a superstitious mother to care 
properly for the poor babe whose blue-veined 
forehead destines it to early death ? Red-haired 
people, no matter how amiable naturally, are 
likely to become fiery-tempered. Popular ob- 
servation is keen face, features, hair, hand, 
foot, beauty-spots, wrinkles, dimples, all are 
mercilessly noticed ; all have meaning. Care- 
ful study only can separate what is really true 
in folk physiognomy from what is resultant to 
belief and what is purely superstitious. 

Faith in amulets is by no means dead among 
us. Metals cure ; gold is good for throat 
troubles, brass for rheumatism. The doctrine of 
signatures a forerunner of the homoeopathic 
dogma that like cures like, and a phase of sym- 
pathetic magic often appears. Thus for nose- 
bleed red beads should be worn ; blood is red, 
the beads must be so. Popular cures, through 
some formula to be repeated or by some simple 
practice to be observed, are numerous. In 
some cases such cures may really be expected. 
Thus (No. 855), to cure nose-bleed chew brown 
paper. To cure side-ache after running, boys 



often spit on a stone, place the wet side down- 
ward on the ground and put the foot of the 
affected side thereon (cf. No. 100). Both of 
these remedies are often efficient. The ques- 
tion in all such " cures " is just how the action 
comes. In the first of these cases there may be 
a real physical result, actually due to the prac- 
tice ; in the other the result is probably due to 
superstition, it is a case of mind acting on body, 
expectancy overcoming a physical condition. 
It would be a good piece of work for someone to 
analyze these popular " cures " into three groups 
one reasonable, based on real physical opera- 
tions, the second explainable as mind-cures, 
the third clearly superstition or magic. The 
whole subject of warts is suggestive. Popular 
belief explains their appearance by sympathetic 
magic. To milk a cow with a warty bag, to 
touch blood from a wart to the tongue, to touch 
irregular knobby growths on trees, to handle a 
toad, to touch certain toadstools, all these may 
cause warts. Things so uncanny in origin must 
be treated by magic. The means used may or 
may not transfer them to some other victim. 
" Find an old bone in the field, rub the wart 
with it, then lay it down exactly as you found 
it." " Rub a wart with a stolen dish-cloth, and 
then hide or bury the latter ; as it decays the 
wart will disappear." Steal " pork from the 
family barrel of salted pork, rub the wart with 
it and throw it into the road. The person who 
picks it up will get the wart." The list might 
be carried far beyond Mrs. Bergen's forty- 
seven remedies. Warts are really cured by 
most of these cures. The reviewer has experi- 
mented upon scores of cases. All that is needed 
to cure warts, which are curiously nervous 
troubles, is to gain the confidence of the patient 
in the remedies used. Plant-milk, acids, tonics, 
touching, counting, transfer, all succeed if 
only the warty victim has faith. 

Most of the superstitions herein discussed 
are " pagan "; some of them run back to stone- 
age times. When metals came into use and 
Christianity was established the symbol of the 
new religion and the objects of the new culture 
were set against the practices and implements of 
the ancient faith. Iron and the cross are charms 
against evil. Some very simple childish prac- 
tices no doubt point back to such ideas. The 
sign of the cross, once potent in exorcism, re- 
mains a guard or charm in play. A boy crosses 
his fingers, elbows, or legs when telling a false- 
hood to free himself from responsibility, he 
crosses his breath in asseveration, he draws an 
X with his mallet in croquet between his ball

and that of an opponent about to aim to " cross 
luck." 

Mrs. Bergen has been one of the first to call 
attention to certain practices which she claims 
show former sun-worship. They are at least 
fragments of old ceremonial circuits. Among 
some barbarous people notably among many 
of our Indian tribes and even among the 
modern Jews, it makes a profound difference 
in what direction a circular movement in a re- 
ligious ceremony is made. A set direction must 
be observed. The order affects processionals, 
movements, distribution of objects, etc. That 
such ceremonial circuits were once observed by 
the ancestors of English-speaking peoples is 
abundantly shown by a considerable series of 
little superstitions and practices. Thus : " To 
make good bread stir it with the sun." " In 
cooking soft custard the stirring must be con- 
tinued throughout in the direction in which it 
was begun, otherwise the custard will turn to 
whey." " In greasing the wheels of a carriage, 
always begin at a certain wheel and go round 
in a set way." " In rubbing for rheumatism, 
etc., rub from left to right " (sunwise) . These 
observances are uncanny reminders of ancient 
beliefs. 

It is easy to claim that faith in these old 
things is past. We may not, however, dismiss 
them too lightly ; faith is terribly persistent. 
Most projects and signs must have failed so 
often that confidence ought to be rudely shaken. 
But failure in mystic performances rarely 
makes skeptics ; one success makes up for a 
thousand miscarriages. The most curious thing, 
however, in some of these superstitions is their 
currency in spite of the absolutely impossible 
conditions to be used or ends to be gained. 
Thus, how could this ever have become cur- 
rent ? "When a person wishes to remove warts 
from his hand cut as many notches on a stick 
as you have warts, and standing on a bridge 
throw the stick over your left shoulder and turn 
your head ; they will go off before you leave the 
bridge" Certain promises are based upon psy- 
chical impossibilities. Children everywhere in 
the United States believe that a tooth of gold 
will replace a lost tooth, if the cavity left is not 
touched with the tongue. A somewhat similar 
promise in Massachusetts asserts, " if you cut 
your finger-nails on a Monday morning with- 
out thinking of a red fox's tail, you will get a 
present before the week is out." Such show a 
keen popular insight into human limitations. 

Mrs. Bergen's work is plainly of value to the 
serious student. Casual readers will find in it 



many reminders of the time when the world 
was young to them. We are sure that we may 
beg readers to send Mrs. Bergen further ma- 
terial, which they may recall from their own 
experience. It will be gratefully received and 
properly used. 

Mr. Johnson's little book, " What They Say 
in New England," covers much the same ground 
as Mrs. Bergen's. Its geographical field is more 
limited, but its literary field is wider. In it 
we find not only current superstitions but 
counting-out rhymes, tricks and catches, nur- 
sery tales and " old stories." It is all good 
folk-lore and well told. Most of the material 
is from Western Massachusetts. To institute 
a fair comparison between the two books, we 
have numbered the items of current supersti- 
tion in Johnson's book, finding more than six 
hundred and fifty. As he gives few variants 
and not much in plant and animal lore, it ap- 
pears that he gives nearly as many independ- 
ent bits as Mrs. Bergen. This good gleaning 
from one part of one state emphasizes our claim 
that Mrs. Bergen's collection will be multiplied 
several times by careful gathering over a wide 
district. FREDERICK STARR. 



THE SOUTHERN QUAKERS AND SLAVERY.* 

Quakerism in Virginia, the Carolinas, Ten- 
nessee, and Georgia, constitutes the subject of 
a timely and valuable contribution to American 
history. The Quakers were a migratory peo- 
ple, and they came to America as early as 1656. 
They formed a part of the population along the 
Atlantic coast, and their numbers so increased 
that at the end of the seventeenth century they 
were the largest and only organized body of 
Dissenters in the Southern colonies. In the 
eighteenth century a great wave of migration 
southward appeared, which had its chief source 
in Pennsylvania, but was increased by emi- 
grants from New Jersey, Maryland, and Nan- 
tucket. The fortunes of these people in the 
South, and their subsequent removal to the 
States of the Northwest in which they sought a 
refuge from the evils of slavery, are admirably 
set forth in this volume. They found life a 
serious business in the New World. Mr. Weeks 
calls Quakerism " the flower of Puritanism "; 
but it was Puritanism without its persecuting 
spirit. The Quakers believed in the rights of

conscience, but they would not withhold these 
rights even from their persecutors, whose intol- 
erance and cruelty they patiently and meekly 
endured. 

" In July, 1656, Ann Austin and Mary Fisher, the 
vanguard of a Quaker army, appeared in Boston from 
Barbadoes. They were the first Quakers to arrive in 
America, and they were imprisoned and sent back. In 
October of the same year a law was passed which pro- 
vided a fine for the ship-master who knowingly brought 
in Quakers, and obliged him to carry them out again. 
The Quaker was to be whipped, and committed to the 
house of correction. Any person importing books or 
' writings concerning their devilish opinions,' or defend- 
ing their ' heretical opinions,' was to be fined, and for 
the third offense banished. The law of October, 1657, 
imposed a fine for entertaining a Quaker. If a Quaker 
returned after being sent away once he was to lose one 
ear; if he returned a second time, the other ear; and 
the third offense was punished by boring the tongue. 
The law of October, 1658, banished both resident and 
foreign Quaker on pain of death. In Massachusetts, 
Quakers had their ears cut off; they were branded; they 
were tied to the cart-tail and whipped through the 
streets ; women were shamefully exposed to public gaze ; 
and in 1659-60, three men and one woman were hanged 
on Boston Common such was the welcome of the first 
Quakers to American soil " (pp. 5-6). 

Mr. Weeks mentions the case of George 
Wilson, who visited Virginia about the year 
1661. 

" He had been imprisoned in Cumberland for reprov- 
ing a priest. He had been cast into jail in Boston, and 
was whipped through three towns and banished. From 
Puritan New England he turned to Cavalier Virginia. 
Here he was cast into a dungeon, very loathsome, with- 
out light, without ventilation. Here, after being cruelly 
scourged and heavily ironed for a long period, George 
Wilson had to feel the heartlessness of a persecuting 
and dominant hierarchy; until at last his flesh actually 
rotted from his bones, and within the cold damp walls 
of the miserable dungeon of Jamestown, he lay down 
his life, a faithful martyr for the testimony of Jesus " 
(p. 20). 

An equally revolting case was that of Mary 
Tompkins and Alice Ambrose, who had been 
engaged in the work of the ministry before 
coming to America. On their second visit to 
Virginia, as Sewall relates the facts, " They had 
been pilloried, and each had been whipped with 
thirty-two stripes, with a whip of nine cords, 
and every cord with three knots ; and they were 
handled so severely that the very first lash 
drew blood and made it run down from their 
breasts." They had [recently experienced the 
same sort of treatment in Massachusetts ; 
" their goods were then seized, and they were 
expelled from the colony in June, 1664 " (pp. 
21, 22). 

According to a law of Virginia known as the 
Conventicle Act of 1663, prohibiting the un- 
lawful assembling of Quakers, they were for- 



bidden to worship. A minister or a layman 
could not offer a prayer at the bedside of the 
dying if there were five grown persons present. 
Dissent from the established religion was re- 
garded as a social evil, and there was no escape 
from responsibility save in flight to the estab- 
lishment (p. 19). The Quakers believed in 
the rights of conscience and the total separa- 
tion of Church and State ; but they were com- 
pelled to pay tithes, and in case of refusal they 
were collected by distress. They were also 
liable to fine and imprisonment. Under such 
legislation great hardships were endured by 
Friends in Virginia and North Carolina, but 
they were steadfast in their long struggle for 
relief, which they finally secured. 

Their experience was equally trying in main- 
taining their testimony against war. They 
refused to take any part in the Indian wars, or 
to attend private or general musters. For such 
refusal they were fined, and the fine collected 
by distress. They constantly protested against 
the hardships of these military exactions, which 
from time to time were modified and mitigated, 
but never relinquished. During the Revolu- 
tionary struggle they refused to take any part. 
Some Friends refused to pay the State levies 
for war purposes, and as the Continental cur- 
rency was issued for such purposes many de- 
clined to receive it. This action aided the 
decline of this money, and gave the influence 
of the society to the British, but it does not 
impeach the loyalty of Friends to the American 
cause ; for no body of people could have been 
more devotedly attached to their country. 
They had no sympathy with royalty, and were 
thoroughly democratic in their opinions and 
policy. But their attitude was exceedingly em- 
barrassing and vexatious. They were constantly 
misunderstood and misrepresented, and they 
were not spared when the States were invaded, 
being exposed to the requisitions of the Amer- 
icans and the thefts and robberies of the British, 
just as in the late Civil War the Friends in 
Virginia, who occupied territory contended for 
by both Federal and Confederate troops, were 
in turn exposed to the ravages of each. Mr. 
Weeks sets forth in detail their struggle with 
the civil authorities for the rights of conscience 
and the extent to which those rights were con- 
ceded during the Revolution ; and although 
individual Friends sometimes swerved from 
their professed principles, and the Society itself 
was not always entirely consistent, it was faith- 
ful to its testimonies. 

But Southern Friends appear at their best in

their dealings with slavery. Mr. Weeks is 
fairly justified in saying that " the mission of 
Quakerism has been to the slave. In this strug- 
gle Quakers appealed to the universal con- 
science of mankind. Here they ceased to be 
propagandists of faith, and became propagan- 
dists of action. They announced their opposi- 
tion to the system when it had no other oppo- 
nents, and they steadfastly maintained their 
testimony until its last traces were swept from 
the English-speaking world." In their earlier 
career in the South many of them held slaves, 
and some as late as 1781 ; but as a body they 
were hostile to the evil from the beginning, and 
this hostility steadily increased till the owning 
of a slave was made a disciplinable offense. 
The laws of Virginia and the Carolinas pro- 
hibiting emancipation were in their way, and 
against these they labored till the Virginia act 
of 1782 gave all slave-owners the power to 
emancipate by will after death, or by acknowl- 
edging the will while alive in open court, pro- 
vided they agreed to support all the aged, infirm, 
and young persons thus set at liberty. This 
law had been defeated the year before by Ben- 
jamin Harrison ; and Robert Pleasants states 
in his " Letter Book " that forty of Harrison's 
slaves had gone off with the British, and he 
intimates that this was a punishment for his 
opposition to emancipation. Friends found an- 
other obstacle to the work of emancipation in 
the laws of Indiana and Illinois forbidding 
masters to carry negroes there for the purpose 
of giving them freedom, and also forbidding 
negroes already free to migrate thither. But 
they persevered in their work, and in the face of 
much difficulty succeeded in colonizing many 
free colored people in the states named. Friends 
who acted as overseers of slaves were disowned. 
They gave constant attention to the aged and 
helpless among the colored people, and spared 
no pains in inculcating the duties of thrift and 
temperance and in supplying them with the 
means of education. It is a noteworthy fact 
that the North Carolina Friends favored the 
colonization of negroes, and it is still more re- 
markable that this cunningly devised scheme of 
imposture and inhumanity which was intended 
to tighten the chains of the slave and perpet- 
uate his bondage was at first almost universally 
favored by the leading Abolitionists of the 
United States and England. In the earlier 
stages of the anti-slavery conflict, Charles Os- 
borne was the only man of prominence who 
comprehended the project and condemned it. 
Mr. Weeks mentions another remarkable fact, 



which will surprise many people, namely, that 
the Friends as a body were opposed to the un- 
derground railroad. It is not easy to see how 
this opposition could have been very united or 
earnest, if we bear in mind the great work of 
Levi Coffin and other Friends in shipping fugi- 
tives to Canada. 

In his ninth chapter, page 216, Mr. Weeks 
makes a statement which invites comment and 
correction. In speaking of Friends, he says : 

"They were not Abolitionists. They believed an 
attempt by the general government to interfere with 
slavery would cause excitement and alarm. The power 
over slavery, they said, was in the States. In 1836, the 
Yearly Meeting attributed excitement on the question 
of slavery to abolition societies, and said that this had 
raised the people of the United States almost as one 
man against them, and had ' closed the door of useful- 
ness ' on behalf of the negro. They bear witness that 
the desire to emancipate was becoming more general in 
Virginia. One of the last things done by the Virginia 
Yearly Meeting is to warn Friends against the extremes 
of the Abolitionists." 

This passage shows how long a baseless fabri- 
cation, well-launched, can live. It must be at 
least sixty years since the charge was invented 
that the abolitionists proposed the overthrow 
of slavery through the action of the general 
government. The Friends believed this in 1836, 
and it is not surprising, for in the frenzied tem- 
per of the public mind at that time the purpose 
of the abolition societies was totally misunder- 
stood. They always disclaimed any right on 
the part of the general government to inter- 
meddle with slavery in the States, and conceded 
that the power over it was solely in them. This 
was the position of the old Liberty party, and 
afterwards of the Free Soil and Republican 
parties. It was the position also of the Garri- 
sonian abolitionists, who were in favor of a 
peaceable dissolution of the Union, because the 
general government had no right to abolish 
slavery. And neither they nor any other body 
of anti-slavery men ever asserted any right to 
interfere with slavery by physical force. But 
in the passage quoted, Mr. Weeks not only 
ignores these well-known facts of history and 
commends the Friends for repudiating a policy 
which no anti-slavery party ever espoused, but 
he revives the exploded charge that the aboli- 
tionists had set back the cause of emancipation. 
We supposed that this accusation had been 
buried too deep for any possible resurrection. 
It did effective service for the sympathizers 
with slavery two generations ago, as a pretext 
for opposing all anti-slavery action ; but its 
work is done, and if it has any surviving friends 
they should beg for it the mercy of oblivion.

In speaking of the divisions and subdivisions 
of Friends, we think Mr. Weeks might with 
propriety have referred to the trouble in the 
Whitewater, Indiana, Yearly Meeting in 1842, 
which was caused by the action of that meeting 
in dealing with Charles Osborne for his anti- 
slavery position. This meeting represented the 
largest body of Friends in the United States. 
By some means the colonization and conserva- 
tive element in the body had then gained the 
ascendency, and abolitionism was regarded as 
a terror. The society had forbidden the use of 
meeting-houses for anti-slavery lectures, and 
the joining in anti-slavery organizations with 
those who did not profess to wait for divine 
direction. It also had advised against anti- 
slavery publications by Friends, without first 
submitting them to the examination of a Meet- 
ing for Sufferings. Charles Osborne was then 
a member of the Meeting for Sufferings, and 
he and seven others refused to obey this unau- 
thorized prohibitory advice. For this action 
they were degraded from their positions as 
" disqualified," and their places filled by per- 
sons who were willing to become the instruments 
of the Yearly Meeting. They were not accused 
of any unsoundness in doctrine, nor were any 
formal charges preferred against them. They 
begged that the reasons for this action might 
be spread upon the minutes of the meeting, as 
a matter of simple justice to themselves, and in 
order that they might not stand recorded as 
transgressors ; but their petition was disre- 
garded. A division in the Society followed, and 
a new branch, which became known as the 
Society of Anti-slavery Friends, was organized. 
This action against Osborne and his associates 
was taken in 1842, at the Yearly Meeting 
which welcomed to a seat among the ruling 
elders Henry Clay, who, in his Mendenhall 
speech, the day before, had declared that " the 
Society of Friends take the right stand in rela- 
tion to this subject." Years afterwards, when 
the new Fugitive Slave Law, the repeal of the 
Missouri Compromise, and the struggle to 
make Kansas a slave State, had revolutionized 
public opinion, the eyes of these Friends were 
anointed, and, like other religious bodies, they 
saw their duties in a new light. The " world," 
on which they turned their backs in 1841 to 
avoid its contamination, had at last taught them 
more wisdom than any divine inpulse had been 
able to impart. But they refused to make any 
atonement for their conduct in dealing with 
these brave and faithful men, and insisted that 
the record of their condemnation should stand. 



The Society was handicapped by its action. It 
owed Charles Osborne much, morally and spir- 
itually ; but its love of consistency triumphed 
over its conscience. The facts relating to this 
transaction have been given to the public, and 
we think that something more than a mere allu- 
sion to them would have been appropriate in a 
history of Southern Quakers. The truth ought 
to be told, and no man or party should be 
allowed to " escape history." 

Perhaps the most interesting portion of this 
volume is the chapter on " Quaker Social Life." 
Their marriages were solemnized according to 
regulations of the Society, and these frequently 
involved them in trouble with the civil author- 
ities, which at first declined to tolerate their 
peculiarities. Friends were not allowed to in- 
termarry with people outside their own body, 
and disownment was the penalty for violating 
this requirement. Second marriages were not 
permitted in less than one year ; but the Caro- 
lina Friends considered this period too long, 
and reduced it to nine months. Friends were 
warned against costly attire, new fashions, and 
superfluity of apparel ; and against " striped and 
flowered stuffs in making or selling or wearing 
of them." They were to have no " f oulds in their 
coats, or any other unnecessary fashions or cus- 
toms in their dresses." One of the North Caro- 
lina Meetings, in 1752, advised that Friends 
" keep out of superfluity of meats and drinks 
and apparel," and that no Friend wear a wig 
without giving a reason for so doing, which 
shall be adjudged of by the meeting. Friends 
were not to run in and out during service, and 
young people were not suffered to sit too much 
in companies in the back part of the meeting- 
house without having some solid Friend or two 
to sit with them. Friends testified against ex- 
cess in smoking in Virginia as early as 1701, 
and those who used tobacco in North Carolina 
were warned to use it with " great moderation as 
a medicine, and not a delightsome companion." 
" Vain and vicious proceedings, as frolicking, 
fiddling, and dancing," were testified against. 
Liquors were not used to excess, and at a later 
period Friends were forbidden to keep taverns 
and retail liquors. State distillers in Virginia 
were disowned. No public paupers were mem- 
bers of the Society, which took care of its own 
poor. Friends were not allowed to go to law 
with each other, but they might bring suit 
against a member who had been disowned. 
Friends were obliged to obey the rule, " Swear 
not at all," even if it was necessary to disown 
the refractory member. They were known

everywhere by their habits of industry and 
thrift, their friendship for the Indian and the 
negro, their devotion to the cause of education, 
and their general benevolence. As a religious 
body they deserve especial commendation for 
their recognition of the rights of woman, and 
her practical equality with man ; and we are 
surprised that Mr. Weeks, in the course of his 
many tributes to Friends, has failed to empha- 
size this fact. From the beginning they put in 
practice what so many have preached in later 
times. The sincerity and zeal of Friends made 
them efficient missionaries. They were among 
the earliest settlers of the South, and the self- 
denying labors of their travelling ministers as 
related in the volume are most praiseworthy. 
They had to journey hundreds of miles through 
the wilderness in order to reach such little set- 
tlements of Friends as had been formed, and 
were exposed to savages and wild beasts, and 
often obliged to sleep without shelter. 

We have not space to follow Mr. Weeks in 
his account of the decline of Southern Quaker- 
ism, which began with the present century. It 
has disappeared entirely from South Carolina 
and Georgia, is weak in Virginia, and has also 
disappeared in parts of North Carolina. There 
are two principal causes for this disappearance 
of Quakerism in the South, namely, the growth 
and increasing domination of slavery in that 
section, which became more and more intoler- 
able to Friends, and the way of escape from 
these evils which the Ordinance of 1787 pro- 
vided. By that Ordinance the states of the 
great Northwest were forever free, and thither 
the Friends directed their way. Mr. Weeks 
specifies four principal lines of travel from the 
South to this new land of promise. He says : 

" The first emigrants to the West went on horseback 
with pack horses. They followed the buffalo trails, for 
where a buffalo could go a horse could go. All the 
women and the boys above twelve carried guns, and sen- 
tries were stationed at certain points, but whether this 
was a custom of the Quakers or not we are not told. 
When two-horse wagons and two-wheeled carts came 
into use a little later it was necessary to double or treble 
the trains in crossing the mountains; a man was put at 
each wheel to push; there were from two to four be- 
hind for the same purpose, and two to chock. These 
vehicles were usually covered with muslin or linen. 
Some had no paint, but were pitched with tar instead, 
while the horses were hitched to them with husk collars 
and raw-hide traces. The movers took with them cook- 
ing utensils and provisions; traveled in the day; camped 
out at night, and went singly or in companies. The 
women rode in the wagons or on horse-back, and these 
companies were frequently followed at a short distance 
by run-away negroes, who took this opportunity to make 
their way to the land of freedom." 



This great exodus of Quakers was disastrous 
to the South but fortunate for the Northwest. 
Ohio and Indiana chiefly profited by it. It is 
estimated that in 1850 a third of the people of 
Indiana were North Carolinians, or their chil- 
dren ; and the stronghold of Quakerism in the 
United States, which came principally from 
North Carolina, was the Whitewater settlement 
of Friends at Richmond. These fugitives from 
slavery formed the best part of the population 
of Indiana ; and, says Mr. Weeks, 

" Nothing can be more unjust than to speak of ' poor 
whites ' as a class without energy, character, or ambition. 
Such is not the case. They are men who have always 
had a fierce, even an unreasoning, love of liberty. They 
are the representatives of the men who stood behind the 
English barons at Runnymede. They plucked victory 
from the French at Crecy, Poictiers, and Agincourt. 
They are the men who braved the heat of the day in the 
Revolution. They furnished the bone and sinew of both 
armies in the American conflict. Their typical repre- 
sentatives are Jackson, Johnson, and Lincoln. These 
were the men who left Virginia, the Carolinas, and 
Georgia by thousands, because there was no liberty with 
slavery. These are the men many Quakers, many not 
who contributed with their brain and their brawn to 
the making of the central West."

"THE RED PLANET MAKS."* 



Mr. Percival Lowell's charming volume on 
Mars must rank among the most noteworthy 
contributions to recent scientific literature. 
Only rarely is a scientific and philosophical 
problem so ably presented, through the twofold 
force of remarkable literary skill and a clear 
grasp of the subject-matter. The theme itself 
is sufficiently unique to arrest the attention of 
layman and scientist alike, but in this very fact 
lies the great difficulty of avoiding the danger 
always incident upon an effort to make a sci- 
entific discussion intelligible to the layman 
without incurring the distrust of the technical 
student. But a calm and careful perusal of 
the book from cover to cover will leave the 
most critical man of science assured that Mr. 
Lowell has not said " There are men on Mars," 
but only that there is striking evidence on our 
brother planet of activity such as we never 
see even remotely duplicated here on earth 
by anything but man ; that on this other world 
there may exist beings having something ap-

the argument of the story amounts to simply 
this : There is no negative evidence that pre- 
cludes the possibility of the existence on Mars 
of beings somewhat human in character, and 
there is no present likelihood that we shall be 
able to see, unless perhaps in the far distant 
future, such possible beings ; but there are 
broad physical features in the planet's surface 
whose origin it seems impossible to ascribe to 
other than intelligent agencies. That this latter 
critical point has a deep fascination for Mr. 
Lowell becomes clear to us ; and perhaps here 
and there his enthusiasm, in consequence, gets 
a little the better of his conservatism. Yet it 
must be admitted that in pleading such a case 
some enthusiasm is justifiable ; and where prob- 
abilities may seem slightly over-stated, it be- 
comes the duty of the reader to make himself 
certain just how literal the author meant the 
force of his language to be. He neither wrote 
nor pretended to write a coldly and merely 
scientific treatise. Gleams of genial wit light 
up many of the pages ; and a large part of the 
whole is distinctly philosophical in tone, and 
ably philosophical. And where the author has 
given reins to his imagination, and pictured 
the suggestions that spring from some of the 
facts and probabilities, he has in no case failed 
to state what is merely speculation ; and such 
speculation as he offers is rational and legiti- 
mate, and, in fact, lends vitality to the discussion 
of a problem whose future solution depends as 
much upon bold originality of thought as upon 
mere persistent search for observational details. 
Clearness and simplicity of statement, and a 
definite focussing of each chapter of the discus- 
sion upon fundamental points, are notable fea- 
tures of the whole style of the volume. Keen- 
edged criticism of the extreme absurdities of 
speculation, such as many Martian euthusiasts 
have indulged in, is the spice of the book's 
argument. Altogether, it is evident that the 
pages are the work of one who is a man of let- 
ters as well as of science ; but their readable 
character does not render them unscientific. An 
hypothesis so cleverly presented is certain to be 
strongly suggestive to the most conservative 
scientific thinkers, even though it may fail in its 
minor details. 

Mr. Lowell has incorporated in his book only 
the general results of his work at Flagstaff, 
Arizona, during the planet's recent opposition. 
The more detailed and exactly technical ac- 
count of his work will be published as volumes 
of the " Annals of Lowell Observatory." The 
whole plan of organization of his attack upon 



the astronomical problem that interests him 
has in it promise of success. A movable ob- 
servatory, equipped with an exceptionally fine 
telescope, to travel from point to point on the 
earth at successive oppositions of Mars, so as 
always to secure the best possible locality and 
atmospheric conditions for observations ; and 
persistent devotion of the observatory to a defi- 
nite limited line of work, these provisions 
together make possible a study that may be 
remarkably thorough and accurate. 

As to the discussion of the various features 
of planetary detail upon Mars, we may make 
the following general comment : The two chap- 
ters upon " Atmosphere " and " Clouds and 
Water on Mars " state their argument in a 
form that carries conviction with it. Granting 
a bare possibility that there may be some vital 
error in the conclusions, we nevertheless feel 
that rational probability stands wholly on the 
side of the general suggestions that are made. 
The two succeeding chapters, upon the canals 
and oases, make an interpretation of certain 
strange and undeniable markings upon the 
planet that at least demands more respectful 
attention than any interpretation that has ever 
been made before. No fair-minded scientist 
can read these two chapters without feeling that 
even if it is difficult to affirm positively their 
complete probability, it is at least impossible to 
take any more negative stand toward them than 
a suspension of judgment, with the balance of 
interest in their favor. The concluding chapter 
is the philosophical leaven of the whole book, 
and we finish its last paragraphs with an impres- 
sion fixed upon us that Mr. Lowell has spoken 
a word that may well give pause to those of us 
who are too prone to be over-orthodox in our 
scientific faiths.

THE June number of " The School Review" is devoted 
for the most part to reports of the work thus far done 
by the Committee of the National Educational Associa- 
tion appointed to investigate the subject of college en- 
trance requirements. The tabular presentation of facts, 
which fills many pages of the magazine, is of the great- 
est value, and enables us for the first time to see just 
what the problem is that confronts the advocates of a 
system approaching uniformity. The question is as com- 
plicated as that of Christian unity, and it will not be 
easy to bring order out of such chaos. The work thus 
far done by the^Committee is, of course, only prelimin- 
ary; and the comment now published by Chairman 
Nightingale and others does not pretend to be more 
than tentative. We may add that this number of the 
" Review " is about double the usual size, although the 
price (20 cents) is unchanged.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Cultivated readers of sound tastes 
A pieaiant book and sympa thies will find their liter- 

of hterary essays. J \ . , 

ary predilections pleasantly echoed 
and warmly supported in Mr. E. Beresford Chan- 
cellor's scholarly sheaf of essays in criticism, enti- 
tled "Literary Types" (Macmillau). The papers 
deal respectively with De Quincey, Lamb, Carlyle, 
Landor, Dickens, and Coleridge ; and the author 
has chosen the collective title of " Literary Types " 
because each writer treated seems to him to develop 
a special phase in literary history. Landor, for 
instance, he terms " Dramatist," not because he 
wrote one or two plays, but because the work he did 
was " essentially dramatic in intention and execu- 
tion "; while the epithet of " Man of Letters " is 
assigned to De Quincey for the reason that no nar- 
rower term seems to adequately express his com- 
pass or versatility. The terms " Essayist," " Phil- 
osopher," and " Novelist " are applied respectively 
to Lamb, Carlyle, and Dickens. Mr. Chancellor's 
rather arbitrary classifications are a matter of sec- 
ondary importance, not going at all to the essential 
merits and interest of his work ; but they seem to 
us in one or two cases at least open to cavil. Car- 
lyle, for instance, in so far as he was a satirist and 
preacher, may perhaps be loosely termed a philoso- 
pher ; but certainly few writers were less genuinely 
philosophical in temper and method. Mentally com- 
paring the most philosophical of his books with the 
work of such men as Locke, Hobbes, Kant, or 
Stuart Mill, one perceives at once the generic dif- 
ference. It is certainly no disparagement of Mr. 
Carlyle to say that his real gift and function in lit- 
erature were primarily dramatic and pictorial. This 
fact is eminently apparent in his historical writing. 
It is for the pictures of men and events, the " stereo- 
scopic clearness " (to use Emerson's well-chosen ex- 
pression) with which he evokes the historic drama, 
and makes it pass before us with almost sensuous 
vividness on the printed page, that we read his su- 
perb " French Revolution," and turn again and 
again, with reawakening zest, even to the intermin- 
able " Frederick." An artist by temperament and 
purpose, Carlyle did mainly artist's work some of 
it scarcely surpassed in its way, not a little of it dis- 
figured by the mannerisms which, hardly apparent 
in his early work, intruded more and more into his 
style after the publication of " Sartor Resartus." 
What reader of the " French Revolution " has not 
resented with growing impatience the parrot-like 
iteration of such epithets as the distressing " sea- 
green Incorruptible " ? A French critic, by no means 
unfriendly to Carlyle, observes : " Unluckily, it is 
the nature of mannerism to fix and stereotype itself 
more and more, and it is not too mjich to say that 
Carlyle's diction ended by becoming gibberish." 
The same writer says elsewhere, with equal candor : 
" Carlyle, who has been put forward as a sage, is the 
very reverse of one." Mr. Chancellor's essays are 



extremely pleasant reading, and redolent through- 
out of authors " old-fashioned but choicely good," 
whom the world nowadays chatters about a good 
deal more than it reads.

Mr. Fuller. ig a i ways rea( jy to f ollow the lead of 

his highest interests. He tries his hand in differ- 
ent directions, wishing to give adequate expression 
to his mood and temper, and thus happily avoid- 
ing the offer of machine-made goods. He did a 
good thing in " The Chevalier of Pensieri Vani," 
and might easily have continued to put a saleable 
line of goods on the market, to the great satisfac- 
tion of the consumer. But he happened to become 
interested in another kind of work, and so wrote 
" The Cliff-Dwellers." Now he tries something else, 
always seeking to express himself as an artist, and 
shunning a weak strain after novelty as well as a 
commercial production of a marketable article. 
Whatever credit, then, attaches to sincere experi- 
ment (and with a man of ability, that is something 
worth considering) belongs to Mr. Fuller's new 
book, "The Puppet Booth" (Century Co.). With 
all the respect, however, due to Mr. Fuller's ability 
and sincerity, we do not think he has scored a com- 
plete success. The form which he handles is a very 
difficult one : it is so very easily misunderstood by 
the average reader, and so very easily misused even 
by a writer above the average. Its true opportun- 
ities are not readily perceived by the general pub- 
lic ; but the opportunities it gives for poor work, 
especially flamboyancy and euphuism, are tempta- 
tions even to strong men. So, along with things 
which really make their mark, we have things which 
are much weaker. The mixture is unfortunate ; 
people do not exactly know what to think of such 
things. Those who admire " The Cure of Souls " 
will not see that " The Light that Always Is " is any 
better, and those who like " The Story Spinner " 
may not see why " The Love of Love " is not so 
good. Even when one manages to avoid failure, 
there is great danger of half-successes like " The 
Ship Comes In " and " The Stranger." Something, 
however, can assuredly be done ; and in what range, 
two such things as " Northern Lights " and "After- 
glow," along with the two other successful pieces, 
make very manifest. We do not suppose that Mr. 
Fuller will continue to exploit this vein, now that 
he has tried his hand and freed his mind ; but even 
as it is, he has written one or two things not un- 
worthy to be thought of with " The Seven Prin- 
cesses " and " A Northern Night." 

Some fifty years ago, it would not 
have been safe to write a book like 
Mr. Maurice Hewlett's " Earthwork 
out of Tuscany" (Putnam), at least not with any 
expectation that people in general would know what 
it was about. But since that time, the Renaissance 
has been very much in fashion ; so that nowadays,

although the keen edge of interest has worn away, 
yet everybody feels very intimate with Botticelli 
and Delia Robbia, while Pisa and Siena are like 
our own front yard. So everybody will have some- 
thing of an interest in Mr. Hewlett's book. As to 
subject-matter (for nobody could guess it from the 
title), it might be called criticism; but it is criti- 
cism put into imaginative forms. Or it may be 
thought of as fiction ; but it is fiction based on the 
history of Italian art. Probably, however, neither 
fiction nor criticism was the author's aim, so much 
as a reproduction of the spirit of Tuscan life, as 
absorbed by a traveller with a keen sense of the 
artistic. And so even the uninitiated reader, who 
glances at the book merely with the desire of a few 
new impressions, will find something interesting, 
just as in any clever book of travel ; for Mr. Hew- 
lett is very successful in assimilating a variety of 
impressions and presenting them fused into one 
image or conception. But the reader who knows 
the Renaissance if only through Browning and 
Ruskin, let alone Burckhardt and Symonds and 
more recondite authorities, the instructed reader 
will have not only such pleasure, but also the charm 
of comment and criticism on familiar things in imag- 
inative form. Mr. Hewlett has been compared with 
Walter Pater and Vernon Lee. It would seem per- 
haps as though the idea of the " Imaginary Por- 
traits " lay at the bottom of some of the pieces of 
which the book is made up, as the idea of Landor's 
" Imaginary Conversations " may have been at the 
bottom of others. But otherwise there is not much 
ground for comparison. Mr. Pater was the student 
of art in its broad relation to life, and as such was 
profoundly interested in the Renaissance. Mr. Hew- 
lett loves Tuscany, and therefore loves its art and 
its history. In so far as the two men deal with the 
same topic, we may compare them ; but we must 
remember the great difference of their aims. Some- 
what the same thing may be said of Vernon Lee. 
Vernon Lee was at first a historian and subsequently 
more of a moralist, although in both cases she dealt 
with the things of art. Mr. Hewlett, however, is 
presenting impressions. He does give us ideas on 
art, and sidelights, too, on matters of history and 
morals, if it come to that. But the main purpose of 
his book seems to be the embodiment of thoughts 
and ideas called up by the life, the art, the history 
of Northern Italy. And because his work is like 
that of the potter who gives living and beautiful 
forms to the plastic clay, he calls his book " Earth- 
work out of Tuscany." 

The English people to-day hardly 
seems as musical as it was three 
centuries ago ; there is abundant 
evidence that in the time of Elizabeth people of all 
ranks were not only appreciative of music, but, as 
a rule, familiar with its simpler technicalities and 
even skilful enough performers. Everyone knows 
the constant musical allusions in Shakespeare, and 
everyone will be interested in Dr. E. W. Naylor's 



Music in 
Shakespeare. 



" Shakespeare and Music " (Macmillan). The book 
is charmingly gotten up, uniform with the " Temple 
Shakespeare," and contains a mint of information. 
The immense medley of songs, dances, instruments, 
customs, technical terms, is here put into some sort 
of order and arrangement, so that he who reads 
may become familiar with an important element in 
the Elizabethan life which gives so much body to 
Shakespearian imagining. One point about the 
book is worth further mention. As Dr. Naylor 
says, the student of the subject must consider two 
things : he must show how music is historically pre- 
sented in Shakespeare, and also how it is emotion- 
ally presented. That is, we must first have accounts 
of lutes and viols, galliards and pavans, burdens 
and descants, catches and madrigals, and all the 
external circumstance of Elizabethan music. But 
then, under the second head, we must have any- 
thing which might show how Shakespeare or the 
Elizabethan age thought and felt of that one of the 
arts which is perhaps the most purely artistic of all. 
The student of Browning, for instance, would have 
something to say here : curiously enough, the stu- 
dent of Shakespeare says in this regard absolutely 
nothing. Historically, this book is full to overflow- 
ing ; aesthetically, it is barren. Whether the lack 
be due to the author, or to Shakespeare, or to Shake- 
speare's time, would be hard to say. We suspect 
the latter. It was not a self-conscious age ; it en- 
joyed itself, without much thought of how or why. 
In some ways England appreciates music more now 
than it did three hundred years ago. 

Mr. Henry Clarke Warren, a gentle- 
man livin S in Cambridge, Massa- 
chusetts, has spent many years in 
making an extensive series of translations from the 
Pali writings of Burmah and Ceylon. These writ- 
ings, he says, " furnish the most authoritative ac- 
count of The Buddha and his Doctrine that we 
have, and it is therefore to be regretted that, inas- 
much as so little has been known in the Occident 
until recently of either Pali or Pali literature, the 
information of the public concerning Buddhism 
has been so largely drawn from books based on 
other, non-Pali, sources, on works written in the 
Singhalese, Chinese, and Thibetan languages, and 
in the Buddhist-Sanskrit of Nepaul." Of late years, 
however, a good many Pali manuscripts have been 
edited and printed, and it is upon these texts, to- 
gether with numerous manuscripts yet unedited, 
that Mr. Warren has drawn in the preparation of 
the present work. The following passage from the 
translator's preface is particularly interesting : 
" After long bothering my head over Sanskrit, I 
found much more satisfaction when I took up the 
study of Pali. For Sanskrit literature is a chaos \ 
Pali, a cosmos. In Sanskrit every fresh work or 
author seemed a new problem ; and as trustworthy 
Hindu chronology and recorded history are almost 
nil, and as there are many systems of philosophy, 
orthodox as well as unorthodox, the necessary data

for the solution of the problem were usually lack- 
ing." Mr. Warren's work is published as a volume 
of the " Harvard Oriental Series," under the gen- 
eral editorship of Professor C. R. Lanman, and is 
a stout octavo of more than five hundred pages. 
Particularly noticeable is the fact that it is offered 
for sale at the extremely low price of one dollar and 
twenty cents, and will be sent, postage paid, to any 
part of the Universal Postal Union, upon receipt of 
an order for that amount. Evidently there is no 
money in this enterprise, for such a book could hardly 
be sold profitably for less than four or five dollars. 

A sympathetic A recent number f the well-known 

biography of " Dillettante Library (Macmillan) 
Leigh Hunt. j g gj ven t o a study of Leigh Hunt, 

by Mr. R. Brimley Johnson, the editor of " Essays 
and Poems of Leigh Hunt " in the " Temple Li- 
brary." Mr. Johnson's account of Leigh Hunt's 
life is perhaps the most sympathetic that has yet 
been written. This is shown in the treatment of 
such mooted matters as Hunt's connection with 
Byron and Shelley in Italy, and the book he after- 
wards wrote on Lord Byron and his contemporaries. 
It may even be thought that Johnson becomes a 
trifle uncritical in the extremely lenient view he 
takes of this unflattering book on Lord Byron, when 
he says that had Hunt " written with less resent- 
ment, the book would have lost its vivacity, and 
there is no reason to regret any part of the affair 
but the heated and persistent abuse with which one 
of the most tolerant and humane of men has been 
loaded on account of it." The author is, at the least, 
decidedly generous to Hunt in this statement. Usu- 
ally, however, his judgments are fair and just, and 
sometimes even felicitous. He gives a neat sum- 
mary of Hunt's merits and demerits in his state- 
ment (probably suggested by Hunt's self-criticism 
in " The Tatler ") that " he was poet, critic, essay- 
ist, and politician sentimentalized." The book is 
furnished with a useful index, and an excellent por- 
trait of Leigh Hunt reproduced from the unfinished 
one by Samuel Lawrence. 

A lively book Dr - Auguste Lutaud's sprightly book 
on America, of American impressions, " Aux 

by a Frenchman. Etats-Unis" (Brentano's), has al- 
ready reached a second edition. The author has 
twice visited our shores once in 1865, and again 
in 1895 ; and he is thus enabled to draw some in- 
teresting comparisons. Dr. Lutaud is in the main 
a friendly, almost a flattering, observer ; and the 
American reader whose national pride is satisfied by 
enthusiastic testimony to the rapidity and vastness 
of our material development will find in his pages 
abundant matter of gratification. Dr. Lutaud visited 
some of our leading cities, New York, Boston, Phila- 
delphia, Washington, Baltimore, Chicago, etc., find- 
ing in each much to praise, something to be amazed at, 
and more to be amused at. Chicago he finds (and 
who will gainsay him ?) " une des choses les plus sur- 
prenantes, parmi les nombreuses choses surprenantes 



que pre'sentent les Etats-Unis a TEurope e*bahie." 
Naturally, a special chapter is devoted to " Les Stock- 
Yards "; and here the Doctor re-tells with gusto 
the swift and tragic " Histoire d'un cochon ame'ri- 
cain." " Une seconde," he concludes enthusiastic- 
ally, " suffit pour tuer 1'animal, et une minute suffit 
pour effectuer sa transformation ; n'est-ce pas mer- 
veilleux ! " The Chicago University (hopelessly 
outshone, it seems, by the marvels of " Les Stock- 
Yards ") gets three lines of passing notice. It is 
fair to say that the author emphatically repels the 
charge that Chicago is merely " une ville d'affaires "; 
the reproach, he says, is quite undeserved, for he 
'knows of " no city which has made more sacrifices 
for its own adornment, for its charitable institutions, 
and for the advancement of knowledge." Other 
chapters treat of " Les Religions " the Shakers, 
the Mormons, the Oneida Community, Society and 
Morals, etc.; and the book closes with a brief ac- 
count of the Federal Constitution. Dr. Lutaud's 
recital is rapid, concise, and necessarily superficial ; 
and it should serve to help his countrymen to a glim- 
mering idea of the present outer aspects of the great 
republic which their forefathers generously helped 
to found. 

In preparing his volume entitled 

The Laureates The Laureateg of England" 

of England. _ . -rrr 

(Stokes), Mr. Kenyon West has 
done a good piece of editorial and critical work. 
His plan comprises an introductory essay, brief 
sketches (about four pages each) of the fourteen 
Laureates (Jonson, Davenant, Dryden, Shadwell, 
Tate, Rowe, Eusden, Gibber, Whitehead, Warton, 
Pye, Southey, Wordsworth, and Tennyson), and 
selections from the work of each. Although the 
personal notices are about equal in length, and are 
very brief, the selections are meagre or copious in 
accordance with the importance of their writers ; 
thus Wordsworth and Tennyson get, roughly speak- 
ing, half the volume to themselves. Mr. West 
rightly urges that Jonson was the first real Laureate, 
and that Chaucer, Spenser, and Drayton, often men- 
tioned as belonging in the list, really have no place 
in it. Mr. West's estimates are carefully weighed, 
but we think he does Dryden something less, and 
Wordsworth something more, than justice. To say 
that the former " produced no poem which was the 
outcome of an exalted mood " is as far from the 
mark as it is to call Wordsworth, " with the single 
exception of Goethe, the greatest poet of the mod- 
ern world." And an avowed Wordsworthian should 
not be guilty of the misquotation, " Joy it was in 
that dawn to be alive," when the poet said " Bliss 
was it in that dawn to be alive." We note also that 
Nahum Tate's hymn, 

" As pants the hart for cooling 1 streams 
When heated in the chase," 

although correctly printed in the text, is misquoted 
elsewhere, with " wearied " in the place of " heated." 
We are sorry, too, that Mr. West uses the pedantic 
spelling " Vergil " for a poet the English form of

whose name has been irrevocably fixed by centuries 
of tradition. The illustrations which the publishers 
have supplied to the book are simply atrocious, and 
a serious disfigurement. As a manual of reference 
on the subject of the Laureates from Shad well to 
Pye, many of whom are ignored by the encyclopae- 
dias and by such collections as Mr. Ward's " En- 
glish Poets," the work has a permanent value.

into a single volume all the scattered verse of that

" A Child's Garden of Verse," " Underwoods,"

set of covers, and the two-score posthumous poems 
first published in the " Thistle " edition are incor- 
porated with "Underwoods," forming a third book 
of that section of the work. A volume of 367 pages 
results, with small but readable print, and a photo- 
gravure portrait of the author. The task that has 
thus been performed for Stevenson by his publish- 
ers has been done by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell for him- 
self, and the resulting "Collected Poems" (Cen- 
tury Co.) includes the contents of no less than seven 
volumes, published at various intervals during the 
past fourteen years. Dr. Mitchell's work is always 
conscientious and refined, the graceful reflection of a 
highly-cultured intellect. It does not often reach the 
heights of song, but, on the other hand, it almost 
never sinks to the lowlands of the mediocre and 
the commonplace. It is, and always will be, a 
pleasure to read such work as " Francis Drake," 
" Frangois Villon," and " The Cup of Youth," with 
their touches of an almost Elizabethan inspiration.

of certain proposed means of relieving and eliminat-

his purpose "to seek for a just and pacific solution 
of social and economic questions which shall restore 
the rightful and necessary equilibrium between the 
physical sciences and social and economic conditions; 
which shall confer upon the individual economic 
freedom and equality of opportunity; which shall 
minimize poverty, want, and crime; which shall 
make for morality, civilization, and happiness ; and 
which shall preserve the political and personal free- 
dom and equality which our representative institu- 
tions were intended to establish." The author 
considers some of the economic and sociological 
conditions necessary for the success of " The Indus- 
trial Army," through which, he thinks, " an equita- 
ble form of annuity, or a cooperative savings fund, 
may be devised and maintained by feasible and just 
individual equivalents rendered, which shall guar- 
antee and furnish upon demand, to each member of 
society, reasonable material comforts during the 
term of his natural life." The writer is not enter- 
ing a new or unworked field, in the schemes with 



which he proposes to better the social conditions of 
mankind. The purpose of the book is worthy of 
all commendation. Its suggested remedies, how- 
ever, are entirely Utopian, and, like Mr. Bellamy's 
" Looking Backward," are not likely to be seriously 
realized until the millennium is upon us.

prepared by Mr. William Jacks, offers evidence of 
as remarkable a tribute as has perhaps ever been 
paid to the genius of a poet. Mr. Jacks has col- 
lected for us translations of Burns, by many hands, 
into no less than sixteen languages, including such 
tongues as the Czech, the Hungarian, the Gaelic, and 
the Latin, besides, of course, all of the more familiar 
literary languages. The Spanish, in fact, is about 
the only one that we miss. Mr. Jacks supplies notes 
and editorial comments in abundance, and the book 
is adorned by numerous portraits of the translators 
represented. It is a curiously interesting publica- 
tion, and will be highly appreciated by readers of 
polyglot proclivities. While on the subject of Burns, 
mention may be made of the edition, " revised and 
partially-re- written " by Mr. William Wallace, of 
Dr. Chambers's " Life and Works of Robert Burns." 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. are the publishers

(Roberts) a satisfactory and authoritative treatise 
on the useful hybrid branch of the military service 
commonly known as the Horse Artillery. The au- 
thor, an officer in the British Royal Artillery, is a 
lecturer at Woolwich, and his book is a rsum6 of 
his lectures and articles of the last few years, writ- 
ten in a style nicely balanced between the technical

and the popular. The story of cooperating cavalry 
and artillery is one studded with brilliant names, 
such as Murat and Kellerman, the fleeting unex- 
pected chances offered by the circumstances under 
which cavalry and guns engage being the very ones 
in which the man of initiative, of dash, resolution, 
and expedient, may win his spurs. Major May's 
book is at once an interesting historical narrative 
and a lucid treatise. There are a number of illus- 
trations, largely portraits, together with plans of 
famous battles Balaclava, Albuera, Wagram, etc. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"Pusey," by the Rev. J. O. Johnston; "Pym,"by 
Professor Gardiner; "Raleigh" (Sir Walter), by Pro- 
fessor Laughtou and Mr. Sidney Lee; and "Charles 
Reade," by Mr. Charles Kent, are perhaps the most 
interesting of the longer articles in Volume XL VII. of 
the " Dictionary of National Biography " (Macmillan), 
now published. From Puckle to Reidfurd is its scope, 
and it takes a thirty-page jump over the letter Q, the 
names of Quarles and Quillinan being about the only 
ones to arrest our attention. 

In " Maynard's English Classic Series " we have a 
selection from Irving's " Tales of a Traveler," a selec- 
tion from Prescott's " Conquest of Mexico," and an edi- 
tion of " Silas Marner," all anonymously edited, and 
therefore not to be commended. Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
have now added to their " Classics for Children " White's 
" Selborne," with an introduction by Professor E. S. 
Morse; and a volume of selections from Long's Epic- 
tetus, made by Mr. Edward Giiin. The American Book 
Co. sends us Burke on " Conciliation with the American 
Colonies " and Southey's " Life of Nelson," both with 
no editorial name, although the notes and introduction 
indicate that somebody has edited them. 

Messrs. Way & Williams are the American publish- 
ers of the new English edition of Mr. Stanley Water- 
loo's " An Odd Situation." The introduction written 
for this work by Sir Walter Besant has already been 
quoted from in our columns. The book itself is a serio- 
comic presentation of the absurdity of protective tariffs 
between Canada and the United States, and ought to 
prove effective as a political tract, although it hardly 
offers the material for a work of fiction at least for 
more than a short story. 

There is little to say of Mr. Hector C. Macpherson's 
book on " Thomas Carlyle " (imported by Scribner) be- 
yond noting the fact that it inaugurates a "Famous 
Scots " series of volumes, that it is highly fitting thus 
to place Carlyle at the forefront of the series, and that 
the author has done his work with sympathy and good 
judgment. The book comes endorsed by Professor 
Masson and Mr. John Morley, and rather takes the 
part of Froude in the controversy aroused by the pub- 
lication of his notorious biography. 

In a volume entitled " Alexander Hamilton " (Put- 
nam), Mr. M. G. Dodge, librarian of Hamilton College, 
has brought together the thirty-one prize orations de- 
livered at that college in competition for the Head- 
Prize. The literary value of the larger portion of these 
orations is unfortunately diminished by the prevailing 
note of exaggeration which has never ceased to charac- 
terize college oratory in America. 



IjITERARY NOTES. 



" The Sea Lions " is now published by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons in their " Mohawk " edition of Cooper's 
novels. 

" Humphrey Clinker," in two volumes, is published by 
the J. B. Lippincott Co., completing their tasteful edi- 
tion of Smollett's novels. 

" Pierrette and The Abbe* Birotteau " (" Le Cure* de 
Tours "), translated by Mrs. Bell, is added to the Dent- 
Macmillan edition of Balzac. 

" Africa " and " Italy " are the subjects of two new 
volumes in the series of " Stories by English Authors (> 
published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" The Hare," by the Rev. H. A. Macpherson and 
others, is the latest volume appearing in the " Fur and 
Feathers " series published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co. 

It is said that 200,000 copies of a selection from 
Matthew Arnold's poems, published by Mr. Stead in his 
" Penny Poets," have already been sold. It seems as if 
Arnold were at last having the " turn " that he predicted 
for himself as long ago as 1869. 

Early in the field for practical educational work in 
the political campaign is President Walker's " Interna- 
tional Bimetallism," just issued by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. Also in this field will be a work on " The Mone- 
tary and Banking Problem," by Mr. L. G. McPherson, 
to be issued at once by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

According to Mr. Harold Frederic, a remarkable 
illustrated Bible is soon to be published at Amsterdam, 
in Dutch, English, German, and French editions. There 
will be twenty-five parts, and an even hundred illustra- 
tions by such artists as Messrs. Burne-Jones, Gerome, 
Tadema, Israels, Sargent, Constant, Munkaczy, and 
Crane. 

Mr. Oswald Crawf urd has prepared a book of " Lyr- 
ical Verse from Elizabeth to Victoria " (imported by 
Scribner), thus adding one more to the many attempts 
to rival " The Golden Treasury." It is a good book, 
of course, but just how good must be determined by 
the number of readers who find their own judgment 
coinciding with Mr. Crawfurd's in the matter of selec- 
tion. 

The following item from " The Athenaeum " delight- 
fully illustrates the hold that redtape still has upon 
English officialism: "It appears that the costs incurred 
by the University of Oxford, in obtaining the consent of 
the Court of Chancery to change the title of the new 
Ford chair of English history from professor ' to 
reader,' amount altogether to no less than 323, which 
it is proposed to defray out of the accumulated income 
of the fund." 

Book Sales of 1895," published by Mr. Henry Ste- 
vens, offers " a record of the most important books sold 
at auction and the prices realized." It is compiled by 
Mr. Temple Scott, who provides an interesting intro- 
duction, besides supplying notes and an index. The 
number of items catalogued is 5695. Mr. Scott ex- 
presses some interesting opinions on the subject of col- 
lectors' " crazes," telling us what sorts of his books are, 
in his judgment, likely to increase rather than to decline 
in value, and what are hardly destined for a more than 
temporary vogue. 

" Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, John Tyn- 
dall, and Herbert Spencer are eminent scientists in

their particular fields. It is to be regretted that they 
have made the fascinating beauty of their style subserv- 
ient to the spreading of many false and infidel theories." 
This gem of criticism comes from a book called " Les- 
sons in Literature," published in Chicago by Messrs. 
Ainsworth & Co. No further comment seems to be 
needed, unless we mention the classification of R. L. 
Stevenson, " by birth a Scotchman," among American 
prose writers. 

The quickened demand for the works of Mrs. Stowe, 
consequent upon her death, will be happily met by the 
new and definitive edition of her complete writings, which 
her publishers, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., have 
for some time had in preparation, to comprise sixteen 
volumes in their excellent " Riverside " editions of stand- 
ard authors. The first volume will have a biographical 
sketch, and all the volumes are to be thoroughly edited 
and furnished with notes when necessary. Each of the 
volumes will have a frontispiece and a vignette, includ- 
ing several portraits, views of Mrs. Stowe's homes, and 
other interesting designs. There is to be a limited large- 
paper edition, each set of which will contain Mrs. Stowe's 
autograph written by her expressly for this purpose a 
few months ago. 

A reviewer in " The Athenaeum " has got hold of Mr. 
Hopkinson Smith's " Tom Grogan," and vents his spleen 
upon it by means of such phrases as " so dull a story," 
and " such feeble trash," concluding as follows : " The 
publication of such rubbish is deplorable, and it is thrice 
deplorable when it is stamped with the hall-mark of a 
good name. Again we wonder at the vanity and weak- 
ness of the mind that could write down such trash, and 
the vacuity that could be amused by it, and the blind- 
ness that could give a book so worthless to a world in 
which there is a plethora of good books." Well, well! 
this must be one of the reviewers who classed " The 
Red Badge of Courage " among the greatest novels ever 
written in America or anywhere else. 

The death of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, on the first 
of this month, at the advanced age of eighty-five, strikes 
from the list of living American writers the oldest of 
its names, and ends the career of a woman of remark- 
able force and ability. The world-wide popularity of 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin," her best-known work, makes it 
impossible for any history of American literature to 
ignore the woman who wrote it, although criticism can- 
not give it a high rank considered as literature. A book 
does not always need to have literary excellence to ac- 
complish a noble purpose, and the triumph of this par- 
ticular book was so great that its shortcomings, judged 
by purely literary standards, are of slight account in 
the total reckoning. The book did more than all the 
arguments of the political thinker to awaken the moral 
revolt that eventually overthrew slavery in the United 
States, and therein lies the ample justification of its 
existence. There was a closer approach to art in Mrs. 
Stowe's delineations of New England life, for she knew 
this subject at first-hand; but they added little to the 
great fame that she had won by her part in the aboli- 
tionist propaganda. That fame was hardly dimmed by 
her exploitation of the scandal which sought to blacken 
the reputation of a great English poet, although partici- 
pation in so wanton and unwarranted an attack would 
have consigned almost anyone else to oblivion, and dis- 
credited almost any other achievement than that of writ- 
ing Uncle Tom's Cabin." The list of her books is a 
long one, but few of them have any vitality, or are likely 
to find many readers in the twentieth century.

OUT OF THE WOODS. 

A Romance of Camp Life. By GEORGE P. FISHER, Jr. 
12mo, 270 pages. Cloth, $1.00 ; paper, 50 cts. 

This is a fresh, bright, and breezy story of a summer camp 
in the wilds of Northern Michigan, " where the pine-trees 
grow." The scene lies near the mining region, and the hero, 
in intervals of hunting, fishing, and love-making, traditional 
summer sports, has an exciting adventure with a mob of strik- 
ing miners. A few touches of Chicago club-life, half an hour 
with the Theodore Thomas orchestra, and a glimpse of Wash- 
ington in summer, afford pleasant variations of action and 
scene. The people of the tale are wholesome, cheery young 
men and maidens whose acquaintance would be delightful 
anywhere. The little book is redolent of summer and the 
open air, and will be a favorite on every shady porch and wel- 
comed by every lover of light, sparkling fiction, whether in 
or out of the woods. 



QUAINT CRIPPEN, 

Commercial Traveler. 

By ALWYN M. THURBER. 12mo, 253 pages. Cloth, $1.00 ; 

paper, 50 cts. 

" Quaint Crippen is a gossipy drummer for a Boston house. He makes 
friends in the railroad cars, after the manner of his kind, and is an all- 
around good fellow. He is pleasant, and so is the book. You will feel 
all the better for reading 'Quaint Crippen,' because it sketches human 
nature cleverly. Drummers will like it because it has enough trade 
atmosphere to enable them to criticise the author's knowledge of their 
business." Halifax (N. S.) Daily Echo.

Field and Garden," " The Beautiful Flower Garden," etc. 

Illustrated with over 200 Drawings from Nature by the 

Author. 12mo, cloth, 81.75. 

A book for the summer months, of great interest to those 
who love our familiar trees and wish to become better ac- 
quainted with them. Over two hundred are accurately de- 
scribed in simple language. The drawings, taken directly 
from nature, preserve the life and character of every leaf with 
perfect accuracy. All types are presented, whether common 
or exceptional, and full explanations are given. The book is 
characterized by a careful avoidance of technical terms, and 
an independent principle of observation, only at times corre- 
spondent with that of the botanist. Not only is the botanical 
name and habitat of the tree given according to the highest 
authority, but the character and coloring of its leafage are 
recorded precisely as the observer is likely to be impressed 
by them.

" A new and striking tale. The charm, the verity, the literary value 
of the book, depend upon its study of character, its 'local color,' its 
revelation to Americans of a social state at their very doors of which 
they have known nothing. . . . The characters are vividly depicted 
with graphic descriptive skill, with a keen sense of humor and not a 
hint of preachiness. " New York Times.

In this book the author pictures certain realities of city life, 
and he has not contented himself with a search for humorous 
material or with superficial aspects. His story lives, and its 
actuality cannot fail to produce a deep impression and to point 
a moral which many a thoughtful reader will apply.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE I. 

Following our custom of the last three years, 
we publish in this and the next number of THE 
DIAL a summary of the literary history of the 
chief countries of Continental Europe for the 
past twelvemonth, availing ourselves for this 
purpose of the special reports contributed by 
writers from the several countries concerned to 
the " Athena3um " of July 4. The service ren- 
dered to students of literature by this annual 
feature of our English contemporary is of the 
highest value, and we are glad to acknowledge 
our great indebtedness for the material pre- 
sented. As heretofore, we shall first discuss 
the literatures of France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, 
and Greece ; leaving the countries of Northern 
Europe for a second paper. The authors of the 
summaries from which we shall quote are M. 
Joseph Reinach for France, M. Paul Fredericq 
for Belgium, Signor Alberto Manzi for Italy, 
Don Juan F. Riano for Spain, and Professor 
S. P. Lambros for Greece. 

The French summary gives the first place to 
political literature, with mention of such books 
as M. Michel's "L'Idee de l'Etat,"'M. de 
Molinari's " Comment Resoudre la Question 
Sociale "; M. Reinach's " Demagogues et So- 
cialistes,"and M. Leroy-Beaulieu's four- volume 
'Traite Theorique et Pratique d'Economie 
Politique." The Counte de Lu$ay's historical 
study of " Decentralization," M. Yves Guyot's 
" Les Tribulations de M. Faubert " (an argu- 
ment against the graduated income tax), and 
the last work of the late Leon Say, " Centre le 
Socialisme," are other works of importance. 
" The mine of history still yields richly," the 
annual output including a new volume of MM. 
Rambaud and Lavisse's "Histoire de France," 
the last volume of M. Vandal's " Histoire de 
1'Alliance Russe sous le Premier Empire," the 
third and fourth volumes of the " Memoires de 
Barras," M. Lambert's " Mariage de Madame 
Roland," and many other books dealing with 
the Revolution and the Empire. A lively pro- 
test is entered against the excessive attention 
now given to this epoch. " Intensely interest- 
ing as that period of history is, the mere fact 
of their being concerned with it is not enough

by itself to entitle reminiscences and notes to 
the honours of publication." Our own times 
are not, however, neglected, as a number of 
works witness, the most important of them 
being Benedetti's " Etudes Diplomatiques." 
The publication of a first volume of Kenan's 
correspondence is, of course, one of the major 
events of the year. Literary history and criti- 
cism next call for mention. " A notable pub- 
lication upon which M. Petit de Julleville has 
embarked, with the assistance of a number of 
eminent thinkers and writers, is ' L'Histoire de 
la Langue et de la Litterature Francaises des 
Origines a 1900.' The work, which when com- 
plete will occupy not fewer than eight volumes, 
is fully illustrated. This first part deals with 
narrative religious poetry." M. Jusserand has 
published a concise " Histoire de la Litterature 
Anglaise." Other important works of general 
literature are M. Nourrisson's " Voltaire et le 
Voltairianisme," M. Leo Claretie's "J. J. 
Rousseau et Ses Amis," M. Stapfer's " La 
Famille de Montaigne," M. Filon's " Le Theatre 
Anglais Contemporain," to which the writer 
pays a high tribute, M. Desjardin's " La Phil- 
osophie de Proudhon," M. de Vogue's " Devant 
le Siecle," a collection of essays, M. de Frey- 
cinet's " Essai sur la Philosophie des Sciences," 
and M. Sully-Prudhomme's " Que Sais-Je?" 
" the work of a writer who has won his spurs 
as a poet, and is now steadily building up a 
reputation for himself as a profound thinker." 
Art literature claims Gounod's " Memoires 
d'un Artiste," the late E. de Goncourt's mono- 
graph on Hokusai', M. Larroumet's " L'Art et 
1'Etat en France," M. Guillaume's " Etudes 
d'Art Antique et Moderne," and the magnifi- 
cently illustrated work of MM. Hamdy Bey 
and T. Reinach, " Une Necropole Royale a 
Sidon." Coming at last to the subject of fic- 
tion, we find this somewhat discouraging intro- 
ductory paragraph : 

"The output of fiction is as considerable as ever; 
judging from the booksellers' lists, at least two or three 
novels must be published per diem. A large proportion 
of these evidently find their use almost immediately as 
grocers' wrapping papers; but a still larger number find 
readers. The public of to-day nourishes itself with 
novels as well as bread." 

M. Zola's "Rome " heads the list, and M. Rei- 
nach's criticism is so just that we must quote 
the whole of it : 

"Six weeks' acquaintance with modern Rome was 
enough for him to make a complete study of that com- 
plex entity. The book combines the pith of all Bae- 
deker's remarks upon the objects of interest in the 
Eternal City with the marrow of the whole history of 
Rome, from Romulus and Remus to Humbert and Leo 



XIII., and a digest of all the ecclesiastical controversies 
that have taken place from St. Paul's day to that of the 
last Encyclical. All this is dull, heavy, superficial, and 
commonplace enough; the plot itself is mediocre; and 
yet, in spite of it, the whole work is powerful. M. Zola 
possesses the gift of laying hold of the reader with a 
hand or rather a paw of surprising strength; he 
holds you in a grip which he never relaxes till the end 
is reached. Abuse him as you will, you can seldom 
reproach him with boring you." 

The remaining novels of the year are " L'Idylle 
Tragique," by M. Paul Bourget ; " Aphrodite," 
by M. Pierre Louys ; " Apres Fortune Faite," 
by M. Cherbuliez ; " Dernier Refuge," by M. 
Rod; "L'Empreinte," by M. Estaunie; "L'Ef- 
fort," by M. Margueritte ; and " Les Kam- 
schatka," by M. Leon Daudet. " As for poetry, 
it is lying very fallow," is the concluding sen- 
tence of M. Reinach's report. 

Studies in local history and topography fig- 
ure largely in the Belgian literary product, and 
have, of course, slight interest for readers out- 
side the Netherlands. M. Fredericq tells us 
that " Les Jeunes Belgiques " are at outs with 
one another. They " have become split up 
into two or three little hostile camps that vilify 
and assail one another with much fervor. Their 
members have even gone so far as personal as- 
sault in the streets, rendering judicial inter- 
ference necessary." Two of them, MM. C. 
Lemonnier and G. Rodenbach, have even fled 
to Paris in disgust. M. Maeterlinck has con- 
tributed " Le Tresor des Humbles," " a work 
of pronounced mystical flavour," to the litera- 
ture of the year. Three works of literary his- 
tory are singled out for praise : M. Loise's 
" L'Histoire de la Poesie Italienne," M. Gil- 
bert's "Le Roman en France pendant le XlXe. 
Siecle," and MM. Hecq and Paris's "La Poesie 
Francaise au Moyeu Age et a la Renaissance." 
M. Eekhoud has made a good translation of 
Beaumont and Fletcher's " Philaster." In the 
Flemish literature of Belgium, although " no 
really remarkable work has appeared during 
the past twelve months either in the depart- 
ment of poetry or the drama," the prose writers 
have " produced a crop that is not only prolific, 
but rich and valuable as well." The veteran 
M. Sleeckx, seventy-eight years old, has pub- 
lished " Vesalius in Spanje," a historical ro- 
mance of the sixteenth century. Mile. Vir- 
ginie Leveling and her nephew, M. Cyriel 
Buysse, " still occupy the position of the two 
leading Flemish prose writers." The latter has 
published two new books, " Wroeging " and 
" Mea Culpa "; the former has won the prize 
of five thousand francs, offered quinquennially

" for the encouragement of Flemish literature," 
with " Een Dure Eed " (not a work of the past 
year, however), and has published " Het Land 
der Verbeeldung," " consisting of two stories, 
in which her unfailing freshness of manner, 
keen power of psychological analysis, and pic- 
turesque power of description are directed upon 
life as lived in our typical Flemish villages. 
M. L. Simons has published a Flemish transla- 
tion of " Beowulf." The last item in M. Fred- 
ericq's report is the following : 

" M. Max Rooses, the well-known custodian of the 
Muse"e Plantin, has issued two volumes of art criticism 
under the title of Oude en Nieuwe Kunst.' In these 
he deals with the principal masterpieces of seventeenth 
century Flemish and Dutch painting to be found in the 
Louvre and the Antwerp and Vienna Galleries. He 
also includes excellent criticism of a number of Flemish 
painters of this century, such as Leys, Lies, Verlat, 
bringing his survey up to the present day. Coming from 
the pen of one who is not only our leading literary and 
artistic critic, but also one of the most finished and 
charming of our prose writers, the book is as remarkable 
for its manner as for its matter." 

Signer Alberto Manzi, writing of things 
Italian, begins with a tribute to the late Rug- 
gero Bonghi, his predecessor as correspondent 
of " The Athenaeum." His translation of Plato, 
his unfinished " Storia di Roma," and his great 
work for public education, will long be remem- 
bered by a grateful country. Speaking of ed- 
ucation, we find the following deeply interest- 
ing statement : 

" More enlightened ideas are everywhere coming to 
the front, and the revolution extends from the writers 
of children's books to those who educate the youths un- 
dergoing a course of higher education. From Carlo 
Lorenzini (Collodi) to Giosufe Carducci a new, practical, 
and rational method has gained a hold in all ranks a 
method which no longer repels the young, but invites 
them to studies which, from being tedious, pedantic, and 
of doubtful utility, have become in the highest degree 
practical." 

Sig. Carducci has published nothing during the 
year, but is engaged upon a poem to be called 
" La Battaglia di Legnano " and an eagerly- 
awaited "Storia del Risorgimento Italiano." 
He has also promised " a work in several vol- 
umes dealing with the early Italian theatre." 
In fiction, " the great event of the year is the 
new book by Ada Negri, entitled ' Tempeste,' " 
a book which has, however, " all the defects of 
' Fatalita,' which time and study should have 
eliminated. The lyre of Ada Negri has but 
one string ; the greater part of her movements 
are well known, and the variations lack that 
spontaneity and ingenuous inspiration which 
contributed so greatly to the success of ' Fa- 
talita.' Though ' Tempeste ' is not intrinsically 



inferior to the author's preceding volume, it 
nevertheless furnishes us with fewer hopes con- 
cerning this elementary - school mistress of 
Motta Visconti, singularly favored by fortune 
since her debut, and now to the surprise of 
her Socialist friends married to a wealthy 
manufacturer." Another leading event of the 
year in fiction is Sig. d'Annunzio's " Le Ver- 
gini delle Rocce," the first of a cycle to be 
called " I Romanzi del Giglio." " The com- 
mercial success of the book has not proved its 
value, but simply testifies to the power of curi- 
osity. This publication of the ' Vergini delle 
Rocce 'has laid bare a series of plagiarisms com- 
mitted by D'Annunzio, both in his verse and his 
prose, from French, Russian, and Italian au- 
thors, and these not amongst the least celebrated. 
The philosophical conception of his last novel is 
inspired by some ill-digested theories of Niet- 
zsche, while its general structure is borrowed 
from a French work. The third novel of import- 
ance is Sig. Fogazzaro's " Piccolo Mondo An- 
tico," which " has rightly been extolled every- 
where as a masterpiece. The author carries us 
back to 1859 ; here the hopes and the struggles, 
the greatness and the meanness, the minds and 
the hearts of a little world, are set forth with de- 
lightful fidelity, without any striving after ' ob- 
scure things,' without any posing, and yet with 
a certain grandeur and goodness of spirit, the 
two characteristics of Fogazzaro's whole work. 
He makes his '59 bear a strong resemblance to 
the present year of grace in all that has regard to 
the freshness of hope and the desire for a high 
standard of national morality." Other novels 
are Sig. Rovetta's " II Tenente dei Lancieri " 
and Signora Serao's " L'Indifferente." The 
twenty-fifth anniversary of the complete inte- 
gration of the Italian kingdom has naturally 
called forth many books of recent Italian his- 
tory, and the outburst of Napoleonic literature 
has been almost as great in Italy as in France. 
Sig. Tebaldo, in his " Napoleone : una Pagina 
Storico - Psicologica del Genio," argues that 
" Napoleon was not epileptic in the proper sig- 
nification of the word, although exhibiting sev- 
eral characteristics of epilepsy ; he was neu- 
rotic." A similar study of Byron, by Sig. 
Mingazzini, " Sullo Stato Mentale di Lord 
Byron," argues " that anyone who should at- 
tempt to reduce to a definite morbid type 
the psychopathic manifestations that occur in 
Byron's life would fail in the endeavour," but 
finds a lack of equilibrium, coupled with the 
special effects of alcoholism and opium-eating. 
Another great poet was undoubtedly epileptic,

according to Sig. Patrizi's " Saggio Critico- 
Antropologico su G. Leopardi." These Italian 
disciples of Professor Lombroso seem unwilling 
to allow that any man of great genius can be 
wholly sound mentally. A far more serious 
and well-balanced work is Sig. Morselli's 
" L'Eredita Materiale, Morale, e Intellecttuale 
del XIX. Secolo," in which this distinguished 
scholar " examines separately and impartially 
the phenomena of the struggle for existence, 
intensified and rendered almost ferocious by 
the increased means of resistance and combat. 
On the one hand, we see an increase in the 
number of lunatics and suicides ; on the other, 
morality is steadily emancipating itself from 
the theocracy, and sociology is preparing a 
better future for the disinherited." The study 
of sociology in Italy, as everywhere else, is as- 
suming large dimensions. Sig. de Amicis, it 
is said, has been converted to socialism. Among 
the books in this department are " Societa, 
Socialismo, e Anarchia," by Sig. Augias ; " II 
Socialismo e la Scuola," by Sig. Pancera ; and 
" Socialismo Cattolico," by Sig. Soderini. 

Spain reports a long list of works historical 
or otherwise erudite in character, but hardly 
deserving of enumeration here. Senor Men- 
endez y Pelayo is carrying on his monumental 
edition of Lope de Vega, his " Antologia de 
Poetas Hispano- Americanos," and his edition 
of Quevedo. " Regarding poetry, fiction, and 
the drama, there is, unfortunately, little to be 
said. Poetry is in a languid state. A certain 
amount of verse on the old lines is produced ; 
but there is certainly nothing published that is 
in the least degree likely to astonish the reader, 
or indicates a new departure of any value, or 
is likely to add a new name to the well-known 
list." The only exception to this general state- 
ment is furnished by the sonnets and madri- 
gals of Senor Rodriguez Marin, " who imitates 
the models of our golden age to perfection." 
The theatre has witnessed new plays by Senores 
Echegaray, P. Galdos, Dicenta, and Feliu y 
Codina. Among novels, the " Nazarin " of 
Senor Galdos stands first, followed by the 
" Juanita la Larga " of Senor Valera, the " Los 
Magos de Cadiz " of Senor P. Valdes, and 
Senora Bazan's four-volume collection of short 
stories and miscellaneous sketches. 

From Greece we do not expect very much 
in the way of literature of general interest. The 
Olympic Games have naturally given rise to a 
number of books, the more important of which 
are enumerated by Mr. Lambros. " Of his- 
torical publications, by far the most important 



is the 'History of AH Pasha,' by Spyridon 
Aravantinos. ... It comprises not only the 
life and deeds of the tyrant of Epirus, but also 
his surroundings and contemporary events as 
well ; and, besides, it depicts the manners and 
customs of the time." Professor George Hatzi- 
dakis, of the University of Athens, " adduces 
in his treatise on * The Hellenism of the Ancient 
Macedonians ' indisputable proofs, historical 
and philological, of the identity of the country- 
men of Philip and Alexander with the Greek 
nation." The best imaginative work of the 
year is the volume of " Poems New and Old " 
by Mr. A. Provelengios. " A native of the 
island of Siphnos, he is most at home on the 
sea. Pence that part of his poems of which 
the title is * Thalassa ' is the most beautiful. 
Yet there are many gems to be found in ' Au- 
tumn Harmonies,' his 'German Reminiscences,' 
his ' Sides of Life," his ' Funeral Flowers.' 
Whether he sings of love, or bewails the death 
of his young wife, or admires antiquity or a 
little deserted church covered with ivy, he 
always soothes his readers by his sound poetical 
feeling and his lovely descriptions. But when 
he repeats a sailor's song or describes the even- 
ing light and the setting of the sun at sea, 
when he brings softly before his readers the 
legions of mariners and their heart struggles, 
he charms us irresistibly." 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THEORY VERSUS PRACTICE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The construction of a certain class of verbs in the 
passive voice, with an object, is inevitable, as its very 
opponents testify by usage when off their guard. The 
" New York Sun " was recently caught in its own trap ; 
and now comes another. The American Book Company 
has just issued a new " Practical Rhetoric " by Profes- 
sor Quackenbos. On page 242 is the strong statement 
that " passive verbs cannot properly govern the object- 
ive case. . . . The construction has been tolerated as 
convenient, but is protested against by all who respect 
pure English." On page 10, however, we have the state- 
ment that "the writer is shown how to express his 
thoughts," etc., in which the words " how to express his 
thoughts " are of course the object of " is shown." 

It is time that critics, and especially editors who 
adopt for their motto the words of Lowell, " I am a 
bookman," thus laying claim to a wide knowledge of 
literature, should throw aside a rule whose formulation 
is due to faulty logic and narrow induction, and enjoy 
a privilege which is theirs by the genius of Indo-European 
speech, the laws of thought, and the usage of good 
writers and speakers of the English tongue.

TRAVELS BY LAND AND SEA.* 

"The Great Rift Valley," a rather "stout, 
handsomely-mounted volume of some four hun- 
dred pages, contains the story of a scientific 
and exploring expedition into British East 
Africa, told by a leading participant in the ven- 
ture, Mr. J. W. Gregory of the Natural His- 
tory department of the British Museum. The 
Expedition was undertaken in 1892 3, and 
Mr. Gregory accompanied it as naturalist. 
The interest of the volume is scientific rather 
than literary ; for while the author presents 
many useful facts as to the flora and fauna, the 
geology and anthropology, of the regions vis- 
ited, his style is as matter-of-fact as his journey 
was comfortably devoid of the " hair- breadth 
'scapes " and privations that usually fall to the 
lot of the African explorer. Since the discov- 
eries of Burton and Speke and of Livingstone 
verified the native reports of great inland seas 
toward the interior of the Dark Continent, 
the investigation of the East African lake sys- 
tem has been the branch of exploration in which 
the widest general interest has been taken. 
Mr. F. Galton pointed out, in 1884, that the 
great depression in which lakes Naivasha and 
Baringo lie is really part of one " which begins 
with the Dead Sea, extends down the Red Sea, 
and ends at Lake Tanganyika " a view which 
has been often repeated, but has remained as 
a hazy speculation until Professor Suess of 
Vienna recently gave it scientific expression. 
Turning to a map of the East African lake sys- 
tem, we find that the lakes may be classed 
under two widely differing types, some rounded 
in shape, as the Nyanza ; others long and nar- 
row, as Tanganyika and the Nyassa ; while the 
description of explorers show us that the shores 
of the round ones are low and shelving, and

that the long ones lie, like fiords, between high 
precipitous cliffs. The map shows, also, that 
these two types of lakes are ranged on a def- 
inite plan the long fiord-like ones occurring 
on two lines which pass one on either side of 
the Nyanza and meet at Basso Narok (Lake 
Rudolph), the line running thence northward 
(as a strip of low land, dotted with lakes and 
old lake-basins) to the lower end of the Red 
Sea, which repeats on a larger scale the struc- 
ture of the fiord-like lakes. The Gulf of Akaba, 
at the northern end of the Red Sea, leads to a 
similar valley or strip of low land, and from 
this the Dead Sea and the Jordan valley " con- 
tinue the same type of geographical structure, 
till it ends on the plains of Syria." Thus, says 
Mr. Gregory, from the Lebanons almost to the 
Cape there runs a valley, unique both on ac- 
count of the persistence with which it maintains 
its trough-like form, and also from the fact that 
scattered along its floor is a series of over thirty 
lakes, only one of which has an outlet to the 
sea. The question whether portions of this 
remarkable valley were formed independently 
and successively, or whether it was all formed 
at once and by the same process, must be finally 
answered by geology. History, however, gives 
some useful hints. 

" Along the line the natives have traditions of great 
changes in the structure of the country. The Arabs tell 
us that the Red Sea is simply water that did not dry 
up after Noah's deluge. The Somali say that when their 
ancestors crossed from Arabia to Africa there was a 
land connection between the two, across the straits of 
Bab el Mandeb. The natives of Ujiji, at the southern 
end of the line, have a folklore that goes back to the 
time when Lake Tanganyika was formed by the flood- 
ing of a fertile plain, rich in cattle and plantations. 
And at the northern end of the valley we have the ac- 
counts of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah." 

The structure, therefore, of the Rift Valley, as 
Mr. Gregory conveniently terms it, has very va- 
ried interests geological and geographical, by 
reason of its connection with the history of the 
eastern basin of the Mediterranean ; and eth- 
nographical, on account of its explanation of 
some of the best-known stories in our folk-lore. 
The author suggests that the exploration of 
this region may possibly furnish some explan- 
atory hints as to certain features in the surface 
of the moon the long narrow clefts known as 
" rills," for instance. " If all the air and water 
were removed from the earth, then the Rift 
Valley would present much the same aspect to 
an inhabitant of the moon that some of the 
larger of the lunar rills present to us." Mr. 
Gregory's matterful book is well provided with 
maps and illustrations.

" The Cruise of the ' Antarctic,' " by Mr. 
H. J. Bull, tells the story of an expedition, pro- 
jected and conducted by Mr. Bull, and organ- 
ized by the Norwegian whaling pioneer, Svend 
Foyn, to the South Polar Regions. Its pri- 
mary object was to prove whether the right 
whale or the sperm whale could be successfully 
hunted off South Victoria Land ; secondarily, 
or rather incidentally (for the expedition was 
essentially a private commercial venture), it 
was proposed to learn more of the mysterious 
regions to the far south, and if possible to effect 
a landing on the South Polar Continent itself 
which was accomplished, the author and his 
companions landing at Cape Adare, the east- 
ern extremity of the Continent, on January 24, 
1894. The " Antarctic " was a small sailing 
vessel, with auxiliary steam, of two hundred 
tons. This small craft had a voyage of four- 
teen thousand miles before her, before the real 
work of the expedition could fairly be said to be- 
gin. Sailing from Norway in September, 1893, 
the " Antarctic " touched at Tristan D'Acunha 
on November 24, made the Kerguelen or Des- 
olation Islands (where six weeks were spent in 
sealing) on December 19, and reached Mel- 
bourne at the end of February, 1894. After 
a thorough overhaul, the vessel started for the 
Campbell Islands on a sealing trip, which 
proved a disastrous one, the " Antarctic " going 
aground in a gale and sustaining damage which 
necessitated a return to Melbourne for repairs. 
In September a start was made for South Vic- 
toria Land. The first iceberg (six hundred feet 
high and several miles in length) was sighted 
on November 5, but within forty-eight hours 
from this an accident to the propeller compelled 
an immediate retreat to Dunedin, seven hun- 
dred miles away. Thus nearly a month was 
lost before the ship again encountered the ice. 
How she eventually fought her way for five hun- 
dred miles through the " pack "; how the lead- 
ers were disappointed in their hopes of finding 
right whales (reported half a century ago by 
Sir James Boss as abounding in these seas) ; 
how the battered little " Antarctic " returned 
at last to Melbourne, unprofitably "clean," 
but with all the honors of her successful fight 
with the long dreaded South Polar ice-belt, 
all this, and much more, is graphically told 
by the author. Commercially, the expedition 
was a failure ; but it had the important nega- 
tive result (bought at a cost to Norwegians of 
5000) of showing that right whaling in Ant- 
arctic waters is not a paying venture. To har- 
monize this result with the reports of Sir James 



Ross three suppositions are possible : (1) That 
Sir James mistook the blue, or finned, whales 
for right whales ; (2) that the right whales 
have, since his voyage (1840-41), changed 
their route of migration ; or (3) that wholesale 
capture of right whales since 1840 has reduced 
their number to an insignificant quantity. The 
third supposition is accepted by the author as 
the most plausible one. The direct scientific 
results of the expedition were rather meagre 
as might have been expected, the voyage being 
primarily a whaling voyage, and there being 
no one of fair scientific attainments on the ves- 
sel. Fortunately, a lichen of some interest to 
botanists was found growing at Cape Adare. 
" As it was previously held that no vegetation, 
even of the lowest order, was possible in the 
rigorous climate of Antarctica, this interesting 
lichen has created a great sensation." Sea- 
weed collected at Cape Adare was also carried 
to Europe. It may be proved, Mr. Bull thinks, 
that this sea-weed was actually growing when 
found ; so that " the number of Antarctic bot- 
anic species will be doubled there will be two 
instead of one." As a tale of adventure the 
volume will be found very readable. There are 
a number of illustrations by Mr. Burn Mur- 
doch after photographs taken by the author ; 
and Mr. Wyllie, A.R.A., supplies a clever front- 
ispiece. 

The recent political tragedy at the shrine of 
Shah Abdul Azim, near Tehran, invests Gen- 
eral Sir T. E. Gordon's Persia Revisited " 
with a certain melancholy timeliness. The au- 
thor, who was for some years military attache 
to the British legation at Tehran, revisited 
Persia last autumn ; and the news of the assas- 
sination of the Shah, Nasr-ed-Din, was received 
by him while the present volume, which is 
mainly the outcome of the autumn journey, was 
preparing for publication. " I little thought," 
says General Gordon, " when I had the honor 
of conversing with the Shah in October last, 
that it was possible a king so admired and loved 
by his people, and then looking forward with 
pride and pleasure to the celebration of his 
approaching jubilee, should perish in their 
midst by the hand of an assassin within five 
days of the event." The Shah's death created 
a somewhat critical situation in Persia, which 
the author discusses in two supplementary chap- 
ters that throw some timely light on Persian 
politics and dynastic questions. The bulk of 
the volume consists of a general survey of the 
Persia of to-day, duly enlivened with anecdotes 
and incidents of travel, which enables the

reader to form a fair idea of the economic, 
industrial, and social status of the country, and 
of its prospects as a possible future participant 
in the onward march of progressive nations. 
It is wrong, the author thinks, to suppose that 
the Persians are dead to all desire for progress, 
or that their religion is an effective bar to such 
desire. The Moullas (priests) are naturally 
opposed to popular education, in which they 
plainly see the beginning of the end of their 
own undoing. As one of them frankly said, 
" The people will read the Koran for them- 
selves, and what will be left for us to do ? " 
But there has always been much liberty of 
speech and opinion in Persia. Six hundred 
years ago Hafiz and Omar Khayyam freely ex- 
pressed their contempt of the " meddling Moul- 
las "; while not very long ago, our author notes, 
the graceless donkey-boys of the great towns 
would vent their scorn and voice the popular 
feeling by shouting injuriously, " Br-r-r-o ak- 
hound ! " (Go on, priest !) when they saw a 
spiritual father ambling along on his donkey. 
In fine, Persia is advancing, slowly indeed, but 
not halting, still less sliding back, as some say. 
The late Shah was a liberal man, and concilia- 
tory and just toward his Christian subjects. 
Christian missionaries are protected in their 
work that is, so long as they do not show what 
the Moullas might term a " pernicious activity" 
in proselytizing Mohammedans. The Amer- 
ican Presbyterian Mission is the only mission 
in Tehran ; and, says the author, " it carries 
on its work so smoothly and judiciously that 
the sensitive susceptibilities of the most fanat- 
ical Moullas are never roused nor ruffled. They 
have succeeded well by never attempting too 
much." This is true praise. General Gordon's 
opinion of the present Shah is a favorable one ; 
and there seems to be good reason to believe 
that under him the equable and fairly enlight- 
ened and progressive regime of his father will 
be continued. The author does not omit to tell 
us something of the nightingale the pet cage- 
bird of the Persians, the red rose's Endymion, 
the bird sung by bards of Shiraz and of Dub- 
lin, for Mr. Moore's bulbul (warbling by the 
Liffey) is no less tuneful than those that sang 
" by the calm Bendemeer." The nightingale 
is the favorite singing-bird of the Persians, the 
young male birds being captured from the nests 
when fully fledged, brought up by hand, and 
then sold in the towns, where there is a brisk 
demand for them as General Gordon learned 
from two small boys engaged in picking roses 
for the attar-essence manufacture near Yezd. 



" The shopkeepers like to have their pet birds by 
them, and in the nesting season these may be heard all 
over the bazaars, singing sweetly and longingly for the 
partners they know of by instinct, but never meet." 

The cages are brightly decorated with bits of 
colored cloth and flowers in season : 

" In November I saw quite a dozen cages thus bright- 
ened, each with its brisk-looking nightingale occupant, 
put out in the sunshine in the courtyard ; and on asking 
about such a collection of cages, was told rather shyly, 
as if fearing a smile at their sentimental ways, that there 
was an afternoon tea that day in the neighborhood, to 
which the nightingales and their owners were going." 

A tempting little book, whose fair exterior 
by no means belies its contents, is Mr. H. D. 
Traill's " From Cairo to the Soudan Frontier." 
The text is reprinted from the London " Daily 
Telegraph," and it pretends, says the author, 
" to no other character than that of a record 
of impressions derived from a couple of brief 
tours in Egypt during the winters of 1893-4 
and 1895-6." The sketches, if slight in fibre, 
are very agreeably written, and merit reprint- 
ing. Mr. Traill's style savors of literature 
rather than journalism though, as a writer 
for the Conservative press, he finds it incum- 
bent on him to glance casually at past Liberal 
shortcomings in Egypt, and to " prod " Mr. 
Gladstone and " Labby " rather spitefully for 
their share therein. The sixteen chapters 
" Life at Sea," " The Streets of Cairo," " Tom- 
my's Egyptian Christmas," " A Theban Race 
Meeting," " A Eaided Village," " A Khedi- 
vial Progress," etc. are studded with striking 
descriptive passages ; for example, the follow- 
ing picture of a dancing dervish at the Mosque 
of Mohammed Ali in Old Cairo : 

" Without any preparation he has stepped quietly 
into the ring, a thin anaemic youth of barely twenty, 
clad in the sort of long striped soutane which these mys- 
tics affect. Extending his arms at right angles to his 
body he begins to twirl, and for five and twenty mortal 
minutes, by the independent testimony of many watches, 
he continues t6 do so. Every now and then, at inter- 
vals of about ten minutes, the speed of his revolutions 
(say, one hundred and fifty times a minute) would 
slacken, like that of a spent humming-top, and you might 
have thought he was gradually coming to a halt from 
exhaustion. But no! At the moment the pace had 
slowed down almost to stopping point, it would rapidly 
quicken again to its former pitch. . . . This man has 
all the air of a genuine mystic. It is impossible to con- 
template the countenance of this twirling fanatic, and 
the contrast of its strange quietude with the ceaseless 
motion of his body, without being powerfully impressed 
by it. As the endless gyrations continue the position 
of the arms is repeatedly varied. Now both are ex- 
tended at full length; now one is dropped at the side 
while the other remains stretched out; now one, now 
both are bent till the tips of the fingers touch the shoul- 
ders. But all the time the eyes remain closed and the 
face wears the sam e expression of perfect and imp

turbable calm. . . . The world of sight must long have

But does he see nothing beyond it through their closed

Why not, indeed ? May not the twirling der- 
vish's mode of juggling sense and inducing an 
agreeable religious exaltation be as potent as 
another's ? Have we of the West so far out- 
grown the saltatory or Corybantic stage of 
ritual as to warrant us in flouting the artless 
devotee who thinks to please his Maker by 
spinning before him like a teetotum? Mr. 
Traill's book is rather timely, and should serve 
to beguile an evening or so very pleasantly.

BAYARD TAYLOR AS A MAN OF 
BETTERS.* 

Mr. Albert H. Smyth, in writing his " Life 
of Bayard Taylor " for the " American Men of 
Letters " series, seems to have adopted the sug- 
gestion made by Plutarch, in his "Life of 
Alexander," that it is not always in one's most 
distinguished achievements that one's vices or 
virtues are best discerned, but very often in 
the actions and sayings of one's private life. 
Mr. Smyth frankly admits that he has not at- 
tempted to give a detailed account of Taylor's 
travels an account the more unnecessary be-

Men of Letters.) Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



cause told by Taylor himself in his justly fam- 
ous books of travel preferring rather to 
emphasize his literary history at home. For- 
tunately, however, in emphasizing the literary 
life of Taylor the author has avoided becoming 
at any time either prevailingly over-critical or 
prevailingly over-eulogistic. 

But if Mr. Smyth has avoided the two great- 
est dangers that confronted him, he has in one 
instance at least seriously laid himself open to 
criticism. I refer to the introductory chapter 
on " Pennsylvania in Literature." The chap- 
ter was written, he says, because this is the first 
biography of a Middle States writer to appear 
in the " Men of Letters " series ; and possibly, 
too, although Mr. Smyth does not say this, 
because it gave an excellent opportunity to draw 
attention to the fact that at one time Philadel- 
phia, and not Boston or New York, was com- 
monly called the Athens of America : a pres- 
tige which that city enjoyed until about 1820, 
when, the author thinks, the centre of literary 
culture passed to New York. Now, undoubt- 
edly this is true ; but is it wise to devote even 
a very short chapter of a biography like this 
to the parcelling out of literary husks ? To 
anyone who looks closely at the literature pro- 
duced in America before 1820, its real insig- 
nificance must be apparent. Franklin's " Au- 
tobiography " and Irving's " Sketch Book " 
are almost the only books written before this 
date that are now extensively read ; and I am 
not quite sure that either of these books will 
take a very high rank among the masterpieces 
of the world's literatures. But since Franklin 
was a native of Massachusetts, and Irving a 
native of New York, Philadelphia can only 
claim the honor that comes from the former's 
later residence in that city. That " the Sus- 
quehanna flows freely through European liter- 
ature," or that " nearly every memorable name 
in our literature confesses some connection with 
the Philadelphia press," will hardly suffice to 
immortalize the literature of Pennsylvania, or 
to restore to that state its former literary pres- 
tige. It seems unwise, then, to centre the at- 
tention on the literature of any one colony or 
of any one state, when even at this date that 
of all America will hardly bear a critical inspec- 
tion. Finally, since all readers of biographies 
are impatient of introductions of every sort, 
one cannot but wish that a carefully written 
paragraph had been substituted for the eleven 
pages of this introductory chapter, or that Mr. 
Smyth had begun his book with the admirable 
chapter on Taylor's " Early Life."

Besides this observation, we cannot make 
many adverse criticisms of this book. It is true 
that one occasionally comes across a clause or 
a sentence with which one is not quite satisfied. 
The taste, for example, of such expressions as 
these is questionable : " Their sense of aifc was 
apoplexed." " He . . . found himself three 
thousand dollars to the good," etc.; and of such 
a figure as this : " In like manner Bayard Tay- 
lor . . . drove his ' new tandem ' prose by 
(Jay and poetry by night smoothly and well, 
and with glad content." There are likewise 
two criticisms from which we should like to dif- 
fer. It is certainly too much to say that Tay- 
lor died " with more unfulfilled renown and 
unaccomplished growth within him than any 
other man in American letters," although one 
accepts unqualifiedly the first part of Mr. 
Smyth's statement, that "the really great things 
of which he was capable were still before him 
when he died." Furthermore, it seems hardly 
sane to say of Taylor : " It appears that other 
poets of America have surpassed him in parts, 
but that no one has equalled him in all." 

Putting aside faults like these, which are 
few and trifling when compared with the many 
and important merits of the book, Mr. Smyth's 
" Life of Taylor " must take a very high place 
in this truly admirable series. It is a lucid 
and vivid record, told for the most part in the 
author's own language, which not only shows 
Taylor's connection with the environing life 
that did so much to mould his character, and 
which was in turn, and to no small degree, 
influenced by his healthful and vigorous career, 
but also reveals in a remarkable way those 
" inward springs and relations of his character" 
with which Carlyle said every biographer ought 
to acquaint the public. It gives much of the 
literary, and something even of the political, 
history of the period in which Taylor lived. 
On finishing the book one has a distinct impres- 
sion that he has been in the presence of the 
very man of whom Berthold Auerback said : 
" He was born in the New World, but ripened 
in the Old."

EXPLORATIONS AND PROBLEMS IN THE 
GREENLAND ICEFIELDS.* 

The literature on Greenland is gradually be- 
coming voluminous. Each of the many Arctic 
expeditions and explorers has made a report, 
and some of the Danish officials resident in 
Greenland have taken the pains to write up 
the land and its people. The work on " Green- 
land Icefields, and Life in the North Atlantic," 
by Professor G. Frederick Wright and War- 
ren Upham, so far as it pertains to Greenland, 
is to be looked on as a sort of summary of that 
which has heretofore appeared in English, with 
a few chapters based on the observations of the 
senior author, who, as a passenger on the ill- 
fated "Miranda," in 1894, spent about two 
weeks on the coast of Greenland, in the vicinity 
of Sukkertoppen. 

Professor Wright's account of his experi- 
ence, and especially the account of his contact 
with the people, is racy, and gives many an 
interesting glimpse of life in Danish Green- 
land ; but when the author extends his remarks 
on the people to the inhabitants of the island 
in general, he falls into the errors of some of 
his predecessors on whom he was dependent 
for information. The volume conveys the im- 
pression that the inhabitants of North Green- 
land and Danish Greenland are pretty much 
the same, though the former are probably the 
only Eskimos of the island whose blood is un- 
mixed with that of Europeans. Not only this, 
but the conditions of life in North Greenland 
are so unlike those in that part of the country 
over which Denmark holds sway, that a hasty 
visit to the latter gives no accurate idea of the 
former. 

Some of the erroneous ideas which have here- 
tofore been current have been given, it is to be 
feared, a new lease of life by their republica- 
tion in this work. Thus, it is stated (p. 144) 
that the houses of the North Greenlanders are 
built of snow, while as a matter of fact their 
summer dwellings (tupilcs) are skin tents, and 
their winter dwellings (igloos) are usually of 
stone. Lack of familiarity with the matters 
discussed is again made evident when Professor 
Wright states (p. 153) that guns are said to 
be of no avail in hunting the walrus. This reads 
strangely to one who within a few months has 
seen about forty of these animals killed with 
these weapons of " no avail."

enough, does not appear on the cover of the 
volume, though nearly half of it, and much the 
weightier half, is from his pen has never been 
to Greenland. His contribution to the volume 
consists of a discussion of the flora (living and 
fossil) and fauna of Greenland, of a summary 
of the various explorations of the inland ice, 
and of a general discussion of the glacial period 
and of those things which, in his judgment, were 
connected with it. 

Mr. Upham has rendered a service to the 
student of Greenland by presenting a readable 
digest of the reports which have been made 
from time to time by explorers of the inland 
ice. It is convenient, too, to have so readable 
a summary of previous publications on the 
plants and animals of the island, though some 
of the author's speculations as to the meaning 
of the facts may not meet with the general ap- 
proval of biologists. 

Apart from the criticisms that may be made 
on the subject-matter presented by Mr. Upham, 
two general criticisms apply to his part of the 
volume. In the first place, it is partisan ; and 
in the second, it is pervaded by a tone of final- 
ity which comports strangely with the unsettled 
condition of the problems discussed. A strik- 
ing instance of the latter point is the following : 

" Near the end of the latest Tertiary period, or more 
probably well forward in the Quaternary era, almost to 
the epoch where the increasing uplift of the northern 
countries brought on the Ice Age, men, having been 
created through evolution from the anthropoid apes, 
spread outward from their native tropical portion of the 
old world, to all parts of the great land areas of that 
hemisphere and to America" (pp. 215-6). 

This, it will be seen on analysis, is a very meaty 
sentence. No less than four momentous ques- 
tions seem to be settled by it: (1) an impor- 
tant question in geological chronology ; (2) 
the cause of the ice age ; (3) the ancestry of 
man ; and (4) the place of his origin. As a 
matter of fact, geologists have never agreed to 
a classification of time which allows the Quat- 
ernary era to be well advanced before the be- 
ginning of the ice age ; nor have they agreed 
that the elevation of northern lands was the 
cause of the glacial period, while some of those 
best qualified to judge of this hypothesis re- 
gard it as about the weakest of all the attempted 
explanations of the ice period. Evolutionists 
have long suspected that the ancestors of the 
human race had more resemblance to anthro- 
poid apes than to any other living animals, but 
the boldest of them would hardly have ventured 
so unqualified a statement ; while those who are 
fond of having things settled, with or without 



adequate basis, will read with pleasure that the 
scene of this transformation from anthropoid 
to man has been finally determined. 

So far as concerns the criticism of partisan- 
ship, it should be stated that Mr. Upham holds 
views concerning the glacial period and its 
phenomena which seem very singular to those 
who hold different views. In the chapters be- 
fore us, he is plainly trying to make a case, 
though it is often clear that the effort is uncon- 
scious. In order to make his case, he does what 
partisans commonly do he sometimes ignores 
facts that do not serve his purpose, and espe- 
cially those that are incompatible with it ; he 
sometimes states them in such a way that they 
seem to lose their force ; and sometimes, appar- 
ently for the sake of making his point, he puts 
interpretations upon them which they will not 
bear. As an illustration of a forced interpreta- 
tion to fit an hypothesis, a single instance may 
be cited. Mr. Upham has long held what many 
believe to be an exaggerated idea of the amount 
of debris carried by glacier ice up in its mass. 
Professor Chamberlin found the ends of certain 
North Greenland glaciers to be from a hundred 
to two hundred feet thick, and the lower third 
or half of the ice well charged with debris. 
From this Mr. Upham infers (p. 308) that 
the same ratio would hold in the great ice-cap, 
which might then be filled with debris from a 
thousand to two thousand feet above its base. 
Thus, from the facts given by Chamberlin, Mr. 
Upham finds confirmation of one of his pet 
doctrines. But the inference is unwarranted. 
Indeed, all the phenomena open to observation 
in North Greenland, and physical considerations 
as well, point to a different conclusion. The 
sides and ends of the North Greenland glaciers 
present vertical faces on a magnificent scale, and 
these vertical faces often affect the sides of the 
glaciers several miles above their ends, so that 
the full section of the ice may be seen, both at 
the end of a glacier, where the ice is relatively 
thin, and further up the valley, where it is rel- 
atively thick. Passing up the valleys, these 
lateral sections of the ice show that the debris- 
bearing stratum at the base of a glacier does 
not thicken at the same rate, or at anything 
like the same rate, that the ice does. Indeed, 
it frequently does not thicken at all with the 
increasing thickness of the ice, and in some 
cases is actually thickest at the extreme end of 
the glacier. Professor Chamberlin's facts do 
not support Mr. Upham 's hypothesis, and 
should not be forced into such uncongenial ser- 
Professor Chamberlin might have said, 



vice. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

with equal truth, that the ends of some of the 
North Greenland glaciers are from fifty to a 
hundred feet thick, and full of debris from bot- 
tom to top, and that their surfaces, at the ends, 
are sometimes well laden with debris besides. 
From this statement, by the same logic, Mr. 
Upham might have inferred that the whole ice- 
sheet of Greenland, to its very top, is charged 
with debris, and that in addition its surface 
is covered with it. Thus he would have had 
confirmation of another of the doctrines he has 
persistently advocated for many years, namely, 
that the ice-sheets of the past carried a large 
amount of drift on their upper surfaces. 

Mr. Upham is an advocate of the doctrine 
that the glacial period consisted of a single 
epoch, though he recognizes the fact that there 
were more or less considerable advances and 
recessions of the ice during this epoch. Others 
believe that these several advances, considered 
in connection with the inter-current recessions, 
were of such extent as to divide the glacial pe- 
riod into distinct epochs. Mr. Upham has not 
concealed his desire to minimize the distinctions 
between the several stages which many others 
regard as separate epochs, and in this connec- 
tion we find an illustration of a statement of 
fact in such a way that it seems to have little 
significance. Thus he says (p. 354) that be- 
tween the first two principal stages of the gla- 
cial period thus far recognized " the maximum 
retreat " of the ice was, in New Jersey, " 25 
miles or more "; all of which is true enough, 
but it is a good deal like saying that " the max- 
imum age of the earth is a thousand years or 
more," when every geologist believes it to be 
many millions. 

This is not the place for a consideration of 
the technical objections to the hypotheses which 
Mr. Upham advocates, or of the evidence on 
which they rest. He has given much attention 
to glacial geology, and his views are entitled to 
respect. But the reader of the volume should 
know that the views there set forth do not rep- 
resent the views of the majority of specialists 
in this field. One does not need to be a geol- 
ogist to see some of the difficulties and incon- 
sistencies in which Mr. Upham involves him- 
self in his account of " Pleistocene changes of 
level," in connection with his advocacy of the 
hypothesis of northerly elevation as the expla- 
nation of the glacial period ; for while he main- 
tains that it was the uplift of northerly lands 
that brought on the glacial period, he supposes 
these same lands to have been much higher at 
an earlier time, without inducing an age of ice. 



Indeed, this earlier and greater elevation, if 
we understand Mr. Upham correctly, is sup- 
posed to have been at a time when the climate 
was notably mild ! 

Without going into details, the reader is 
warned that the time-relations of the various 
uplifts and subsidences which have doubtless 
affected the North American continent in the 
past, to the glacial period, have not been made 
out with any considerable degree of certainty. 
This is a problem the solution of which belongs 
to the future. 

Mr. Upham seems to us not to do justice to 
alternative hypotheses as to the cause of the 
glacial period, and he still clings to the idea 
that the great ice-sheet of the glacial period 
finally caused its own dissolution, by sinking 
the land beneath it ; although the apparently 
irrefragable argument against this doctrine has 
never been met. 

The chapter on the stages of the ice age can 
hardly hope to meet with favor among geolo- 
gists. Old terms e. </., Champlain are used 
in new ways, and in ways that are sure to lead 
to confusion. Classification is pushed to an 
extreme which existing knowledge hardly seems 
to warrant ; and while Mr. Upham's ideas on 
this point are of interest to geologists, who will 
not misunderstand them, it seems unfortunate 
that they should have been put forward in a vol- 
ume not intended, as we infer, for specialists. 

In spite of all these criticisms, the book has 
merit, and will interest various classes of readers.

THE DIAL, 



[Aug. 1, 



these three functions are mutually involved ; but 
within recent years the especial emphasis has been 
laid upon the determination of the text, the integ- 
rity and the historical setting of the New Testa- 
ment literature. There have been numberless works 
that have dealt specifically either with history or 
criticism, but few that have attempted from a dis- 
tinctly modern point of view the application of both 
to interpretation. 

If we except Bishop Lightf oot, there is no man 
among English scholars who has done more for the 
constructive side of critical scholarship than Pro- 
fessor Sanday. His works upon patristic literature 
and upon inspiration have been universally recog- 
nized as of the utmost value. Of all men, he is the 
best fitted to prepare a commentary upon the Epis- 
tle to the Romans, the one work in the New Tes- 
tament demanding preeminently a judicial mind, 
critical insight, logical intuition, and an historical 
sense. It is therefore with peculiar satisfaction that 
we welcome, as the first instalment on the New 
Testament side of the " International Critical Com- 
mentaries," the work by Professors Sanday and 
Headlam. For such a work, the preface is remark- 
ably modest : to judge from their own language, 
one would suppose the only excuse for the new vol- 
ume was the need of completing this series of com- 
mentaries. But the reader is inclined to be more 
appreciative. The merits of this work may be said 
to be, in addition to independent scholarship and 
encyclopaedic acquaintance with the literature, the 
recognition of the Jewish training of Paul as a mod- 
ifying force in the formulation of his theology ; the 
attempt to interpret the Epistle from a standpoint, 
not of to-day's theological questions, but from that 
of the theological conditions of the first century ; 
and, finally, the attempt to construct an exegetical 
background by the use of that mine of information, 
the Jewish Apocrypha. 

As far as exegetical processes are concerned, the 
work is of singular excellence. Not only does it 
have the orderly arrangement that pedagogical ex- 
perience enforced, but the perspective in the rela- 
tive importance of the questions discussed is well 
preserved by the mechanical make-up of the work. 
It is, of course, impossible to discuss all the exeget- 
ical positions taken by the authors, but attention 
should at least be called to the philological discus- 
sions of such terms as " son of God," justification, 
law, and that crux of all interpreters, Romans 3:25. 
It is gratifying to find so distinct a recognition as 
that given in the note upon the Doctrine of Mys- 
tical Union with Christ (p. 162) of that central 
teaching of Paul which Matthew Arnold, and even 
such an anti-ecclesiastical writer as Thomas Hild 
Green, have done so much to clarify and enforce ; 
the former in his " St. Paul and Protestantism," 
and the latter in the long sermon so well known at 
second hand to readers of " Robert Elsmere." But, 
after all, the significance of the book lies largely in 
its profoundly conservative temper and tendency. 
A commentary is not a treatise on systematic theol- 



ogy, but it is to-day far more symptomatic of the di- 
rection in which critical biblical thought is setting. 
It is, therefore, a phenomenon that cannot fail to 
be noticed by one familiar with New Testament 
scholarship, that the evangelical tendency so strong 
in the work of a conservative and at times apolo- 
getic scholar like Sanday, is also perceptible in con- 
temporary German thought, especially in such men 
as Beyschlag, Wendt, and, in certain particulars, 
Loofs. In matters not purely dogmatic there are 
also to be seen evidences of a conservative reaction 
in Stilgenfeld, Harnack, Kriiger, and Jiilicher. It 
is, indeed, not too much to say that, notwithstand- 
ing many unessentials are being rejected and many 
essentials are being redescribed, the centre of Chris- 
tianity is being increasingly felt to be the work and 
character of its Founder. At any rate, it is cer- 
tainly true that the constructive purpose so domi- 
nant in this output of the critical theologian is in 
keeping with the new positive method that is now 
prevalent among New Testament scholars. 

A commentary on one of the Gospels, and espe- 
cially upon Mark, calls for special critical attain- 
ments. The time has long since passed in Germany 
when the commentator would think of neglecting 
the modern theories of the relations and origins of 
the synoptic accounts. And yet, until Professor 
Gould's work on " The Gospel According to St. 
Mark " appeared, English and American scholars 
had been content with separate works upon the 
higher criticism of the gospels and with the type of 
commentary in vogue a couple of generations ago. 
It is true that the various English translations of 
German writers notably those of Weiss and Meyer 
partially atoned for the lack, but none the less 
the absence of such works was not creditable to our 
biblical scholarship. It is therefore with special 
interest that one examines the work of Professor 
Gould. 

We are inclined to believe that as far as textual 
criticism and well-balanced exegesis is concerned 
this commentary will rank with the best of those of 
the moderate critical school. Professor Gould has 
shown not only a painstaking scholarship, but also 
a gratifying readiness to restrict his opinions to his 
data. Accordingly, his exposition of the text is sin- 
gularly free from bias, and, in general, such as must 
commend itself to other students. We miss, indeed, 
the wealth of scholarship shown by Professor San- 
day, but the gospel does not so naturally suggest 
studies of special topics. And even if one is inclined 
at times to question certain points (as the transla- 
tion of the aorist 14:41 and the account of Judas 
14:44), it cannot be denied that in general the inter- 
pretation is admirably done. 

It is to be regretted that we cannot express quite 
the same satisfaction with the higher criticism of 
the work, and especially with the author's handling 
of the synoptic problem. Professor Gould accepts 
naturally the two-source theory of the synoptics, but 
he is not especially concerned with the bearing of 
such a position upon the interpretation of the gos- 



1896.]

pel. In fact, although we hesitate to say it, not 
only is the critical introduction disappointing, but 
the author's theory as to success seems superimposed 
upon an already prepared exegesis. This is by no 
means what we should expect in a critical commen- 
tary. Especially after the work of Wenut is it 
surprising to find so little appreciation of the possi- 
bility of a predominatingly topical and so unchro- 
nological order in Mark, and utter silence as to the 
theory of a double apocalypse in chapter 13. Then, 
too, it certainly would be expected that there would 
have been more attention given to relations of the 
synoptic with the Johannian account of the Passion 
Week. Is it altogether impossible that Mark's ac- 
count of the events of that week is derived from an- 
other than the Petrine source ? And in other 
cases one cannot but feel disappointed that Profes- 
sor Gould should not have given to the higher crit- 
icism the same attention and independent judgment 
he has bestowed upon the text. An example of 
what he is capable of is to be seen in his discussion 
of the Appendix to the gospel. 

Yet taken altogether, although hardly to be classed 
with the works of Professors Sanday and Headlam, 
this volume is sure to be ranked as among the best 
commentaries upon the second gospel if indeed it 
be not counted the best commentary on Mark writ- 
ten in English. 

Closely in line with the spirit indicated in the 
work of Professors Sanday and Headlam is the little 
volume on " The Kecords and Letters of the Apos- 
tolic Age," by Professor Burton, whose similar vol- 
ume, prepared in conjunction with Professor Ste- 
vens of Rochester, on " The Life of Christ," is well 
known. The purpose of the present work is to treat 
the Acts and the Epistles of the New Testament as 
so many historical documents which may be ar- 
ranged on a reasonable chronological basis, and so 
furnish data for the historical student. Passages 
dealing with the same historical circumstances are 
arranged in parallel columns, whether they come 
from the Acts or from some epistle ; while the dif- 
ferent epistles are introduced into the harmony 
thus formed at such points as correspond approxi- 
mately to the time in which they were written. In 
such an arrangement there must be, of course, cer- 
tain presuppositions in regard to the chronology of 
the apostolic age. Such points as require detailed 
mention are discussed in a series of admirable notes, 
introduced as an appendix to the volume. In these 
notes we have an impartial discussion of the various 
chronological arrangements advanced, with litera- 
ture and such conclusions as seem warranted by the 
evidence. Special students of the New Testament 
will perhaps be interested in Professor Burton's 
adoption of the South Galatian theory, and his as- 
signing the time of the composition of the Letter to 
the Galatians to the period which intervened during 
the time between Paul's second and third mission- 
ary tours. Thanks to the discussion inaugurated 
by Ramsay's "Church in the Roman Empire," 
this position seems now fairly on its way to dis- 



place the view so long held by virtue of the argu- 
ments of Lightfoot. On historical and geographical 
rather than purely literary grounds, this view (which 
by the way is by no means new ) seems certainly the 
more tenable. 

In a work intended for popular use, it would not 
be perhaps altogether wise to introduce critical dis- 
cussion in regard to the composition of the book of 
Acts ; and yet we cannot help wishing that the au- 
thor had seen best to add a note upon the various 
theories as to the sources of that work. Just at 
present, the Acts is especially under investigation ; 
and it is not altogether impossible that even the 
unprofessional biblical student would get new light 
from the presentation of possible sources of the 
work. For after all, the work of a New Testament 
book, like that of any historical work, rises and 
falls with the worth of the sources whence its author 
drew his information. But this, of course, is a mat- 
ter which by no means affects the value of the book 
for the work which it was intended to perform as 
a sort of harmony of the Acts and the Epistles. 

The criticism of Acts is just at present among the 
most vital matters in New Testament study. The 
older view which accepted it as of coordinate his- 
toricity with the Pauline epistles has gradually lost 
its hold upon scholars, and the tendency has been 
to regard it with Clemens as composed of various 
bits of information which have been grouped to- 
gether and subjected to various redactions, or, with 
Spitta, to regard it as a combination of two main 
sources, one of which is soberly historical and the 
other is almost entirely legendary and untrust- 
worthy. And yet there is also a tendency on the 
part of certain scholars just at present to treat this 
remarkable book with somewhat greater respect. 
Weizsacker, for instance, although often question- 
ing the book's historical accuracy, and always ready 
to discover contradictions between it and the state- 
ments of Paul, nevertheless discovers many elements 
which he regards as genuinely historical. But the 
protagonist of the defenders of the book's histo- 
ricity is the indefatigable Professor of Humanity in 
Aberdeen. In a certain way, Professor Ramsay, 
author of " St. Paul the Traveller and the Roman 
Citizen," is doing for Acts what Professor Sayce 
claims to be doing (one can hardly say more) for 
the Pentateuch. But because of his archaeological 
knowledge, he has not so far swung away from lit- 
erary criticism as not to be convinced of the exist- 
ence of sources older than the book itself, and of 
the existence of other elements in the book which 
are younger than a larger part of the book as it 
now stands. Thus, the succession of remarkable 
incidents allotted to Paul's stay in Ephesus (Acts, 
19:11-20), the story of Judas Iscariot, the account 
of Annanias and Saphira, the speaking with tongues, 
are regarded by Professor Ramsay as popular stories 
which have somehow crept into an otherwise thor- 
oughly trustworthy historical work. 

Of the latter fact, Professor Ramsay is beyond 
suspicion. It is, indeed, delightful to watch his de- 



70

[Aug. 1, 



votion to the historical skill of Luke, about whose 
authorship of the Acts he is equally without shadow 
of doubt. It may be that this devotion is the zeal 
of a new convert, for Professor Ramsay declares 
that formerly he held to the views of the Tubingen 
school, from which his archaeological investigations 
turned him. But be that as it may, he finds in the 
Acts the characteristics which belong to the first 
grade of historical works, at the head of which stand 
the histories of Thucydides. " Every minute fact 
stated in Acts has its own significance." There can 
be no possibility of contradiction between Luke and 
the Epistles ; and, indeed, the ingenuity with which 
Professor Ramsay overturns apparent difficulties, 
or makes them serve the purpose of harmonization, 
is truly marvellous. It is, of course, not altogether 
a novelty to identify Paul's second visit to Jerusalem, 
mentioned in the Epistle to the Galatians, with the 
second visit mentioned in Acts ; but everyone had 
supposed that the question had been finally settled 
by Lightfoot in favor of the contrary view. But 
then, so too had everyone thought that the question 
as to the location of the Galatian churches had been 
answered by the same great authority. Professor 
Ramsay, although admiring Lightfoot, finds plenty 
of opportunities to differ with him, and does not 
hesitate to charge him, so far as this question is con- 
cerned, with having "led English scholarship into 
a cul de sac " ( p. 6) . Having with considerable suc- 
cess attacked the traditional theory as to Galatia, 
he now with equal enthusiasm establishes not only 
the possibility but the certainty of the identity of 
the second visit of the Galatians letter with the 
visit of Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem at the 
time of the famine. It must be confessed that his 
assurance is not altogether unjustified. In fact, the 
more one considers his position and works upon 
Paul's own words in the Epistle to the Galatians, 
the more one is tempted to agree with it. It would 
be remarkable if for a second time an untheological 
scholar, as Professor Ramsay claims to be, should 
thus again reverse a supposed unquestionable opinion. 

It is worth noticing that Professor Ramsay, while 
holding to unity of authorship in the work, discov- 
ers within it traces of a variety of sources. Chief 
among these sources is the " travel document " which 
embraces practically the second half of Acts. This 
again is not altogether homogeneous, but embraces 
Luke's diary, notes of conversations with Paul, and 
possibly other matters. As to the first half of Acts, 
the author's opinion is somewhat cloudy. He re- 
gards it as inferior, decidedly inferior, to the sec- 
ond half ; but although admitting the possibility of 
various legendary elements in it, nevertheless is 
inclined to regard it as essentially the work of the 
author of the " travel document " who here was 
forced to use sources of varying value. Here again 
Professor Ramsay seems upon solid critical ground. 

Various questions, however, suggest themselves, 
less, it is true, in regard to the general positions 
of the book than in regard to certain incidental 
points. Especially do we hesitate to follow Profes- 



sor Ramsay altogether in his use of the Codex 
Bezae. In this work, as in his previous book upon 
the Church and the Empire, Professor Ramsay USQS 
this codex constantly to establish or illustrate 
(mainly, it is true, correctly) the point of view of 
the second century, as contrasted with that of Acts. 
But sometimes the Acts seem to be given a too 
prominent position, and its text to be rather arbi- 
trarily regarded as superior to that of the three 
great MSS. And then, too, one would like the au- 
thor's authority for his characterization of the Jews 
at Corinth as a self-administering community (p. 
259), and for his certainty that sacrifices before the 
gates at Lystra are improbable (p. 119). Further, 
the book as a literary product is very uneven. Some 
points are altogether omitted which we should ex- 
pect to be treated, while others are discussed most 
exhaustively. The author's style is fortunately 
vivacious and reasonably clear, but one could wish 
that the work had been undertaken somewhat more 
systematically and somewhat less from the purely 
apologetic point of view. 

And yet as a whole this book bears out the prom- 
ise of " The Church in the Roman Empire." What 
we now ask of Professor Ramsay is, that instead of 
re-casting semi-popular lectures, he shall give us as 
technical and systematic a study of the apostolic 
age in the light of archaeology as is his " Historical 
Geography of Asia Minor." It is high time for an 
English or American scholar to produce a work 
upon this key to the New Testament history, which 
shall rank with the volumes of Clemen and Spitta 
in critical acumen, and at the same time shall sur- 
pass them in historical learning.

It is now sixteen years since the ap- 
vemon Lee's pe arance of Studies of the Eight- 

latest volume. i /-* T i i i 

eenth Century in Italy, a book which 
excited much interest and admiration in the English 
and Italian critical journals. In that time, the lady 
who writes under the name of Vernon Lee has 
become a figure in the world of art and letters, as 
distinct, if not as widely known, as Mr. Pater or 
Mr. Symonds. Her work is mainly critical, and of 
high value. Although most familiar with painting 
and music, and almost always finding her subjects 
in Italian art, chiefly of the Renaissance, her inter- 
ests are by no means confined, but reach out into 
general aesthetic inquiry, and more widely into ques- 
tions on the conduct of life. In " Baldwin " and 
" Althea," dealing with aspirations and duties, she 
seemed farthest from home ; in " Belcaro " and 
"Juvenilia" she is perhaps of most general inter- 
est. Her latest volume, " Renaissance Fancies and 
Studies" (Putnam), like "Euphorion," is more es- 
pecially directed to something of a critical treatment 
of a definite artistic and historical period. Rarely, 
however, does Vernon Lee discuss any work of art 



1896.]

or any artistic development for itself alone ; and in 
this book, although the separate subjects are not 
mere points of departure for more theoretic discus- 
sion, there is never lacking the breadth of view and 
the general bearing on men and things which makes 
the author something more than an art-critic. As 
a historian of art, as one who seeks to render the 
temper of the Italian Renaissance in a scientific 
reproduction, Vernon Lee may not be as successful 
as some other writers. But as a criticism of a most 
interesting part of human development, her work 
cannot be neglected. She has been called a follower 
of Mr. Pater or Mr. Ruskin; but although her 
interests have probably taken certain channels in 
result of those men's writing, she is by no means a 
continuer of the work of either. Vernon Lee is a 
clearly-cut and independent personality, and net- 
works are original contributions, to our thinking, 
on 'the subjects which she handles. Those who have 
followed her earlier work know with each new vol- 
ume what excellences they may expect and what 
drawbacks they must encounter. This present vol- 
ume is hardly one of her best ; there is a good deal 
of the quality which has made her later writing dif- 
ficult to enjoy. Still, " The Valedictory " and " The 
Love of the Saints " will be read with great interest 
by those who have followed her work so far ; and 
although the book as a whole will not be remem- 
bered like " Euphorion," of which it is a sort of 
sequel, it is one which readers of art-criticism will 
desire to know and think over. 



Professor William Knight is a faith- 
a? f ul Wordsworthian, although not ex- 
actly a brilliant exponent of his fav- 
orite poet, and is probably the most competent man 
living to prepare a definitive edition of Wordsworth. 
The work is now well under way, and four volumes 
have already been received by us. They are volumes 
of the " Eversley " series (Macmillan), so acceptable 
in every mechanical way, and already associated 
with so many of the greatest names in nineteenth 
century English literature. Professor Knight's 
eleven-volume Wordsworth (1882-1889) has here- 
tofore been the standard library edition of the poet, 
but the editor takes care to inform us that the pres- 
ent edition is by no means to be a mere reproduc- 
tion of the earlier one. We summarize his state- 
ment of the features to be embodied in the sixteen 
volumes to which the new work will extend. The 
arrangement of the poems is to be chronological in 
the order of composition, not of publication. Words- 
worth's own changes of text, in successive editions, 
are given in foot-notes, as well as other changes sug- 
gested by the poet, but never put into print by him. 
The notes dictated by Wordsworth to Miss Isabella 
Fenwick are reprinted in full, and topographical 
notes are also supplied. Poems not published dur- 
ing Wordsworth's life, a bibliography of works and 
editions, and a life of the poet, are supplied. Thus 
far, the new edition corresponds with the earlier 
eleven-volume work. The new features are sub- 



stantially as follows : The notes are better classified, 
and carefully distinguished as to authorship. All 
the prose works, as collected by Dr. Grosart, are 
given, and will occupy two volumes, following the 
eight devoted to the poems. The greater part of 
Dorothy Wordsworth's journals will be printed, 
filling two volumes. The correspondence, in three 
volumes, will be arranged chronologically, and will 
include much new material. The bibliography will 
be greatly expanded. The life, owing to the elim- 
ination of the letters, will be confined to a single 
volume, the sixteenth and last of the edition. The 
illustrations are to be a portrait and a vignette for 
each volume. This brief description will indicate 
the thorough and painstaking character of the work 
with which the editor is now crowning his lifelong 
Wordsworthian labors, and will show to the student 
how indispensable the new edition must become to 
him, however well he be supplied with earlier ones. 

The leading French critics who con- 

tribute literar y causeries or f**w* 

tons to the newspapers collect their 
matter into volumes about as fast as it accumulates, 
a fact which makes it possible for the student of 
contemporary criticism to stock his library more 
largely from French sources than from any other. 
Indeed, one would miss sadly the many volumes of 
this sort of work that bear the names of such men 
as Gautier, M. Francisque Sarcey, M. Jules Le- 
mattre, and M. Anatole France. The practice of 
these men would be worth imitation in England 
and America if a significant proviso we had 
a similar body of entertaining and well-equipped 
critical writers. Perhaps the only way to find out 
whether we have them is to try the experiment on 
a considerable scale. But we doubt if Mr. Richard 
Le Gallienne was exactly the person to begin. His 
two volumes of "Retrospective Reviews" (Dodd), 
taken from the English newspapers to which he has 
contributed current criticism for the past five years, 
cover the most important works in belles-lettres that 
have appeared during that period, but are not dis- 
tinguished for either profundity or scholarship. Mr. 
Le Galliene is preeminently a phrase-maker, and is 
often deluded by the ring of the verbal counters 
that he has coined. He says a good many graceful 
things, and also not a few foolish and bumptious 
things. Altogether, his volumes hardly seem to 
have been worth making. Mr. A. T. Quiller-Couch's 
" Adventures in Criticism " (Scribner), which is 
also a collection of reprinted reviews, has decidedly 
more value than the work already discussed, although 
in the very first chapter we come upon the Philis- 
tine notion that Chaucer should be read with the 
pronunciation of the nineteenth century, and this 
pronouncement is not unmatched by others equally 
depressing scattered throughout the pages. But Mr. 
Quiller-Couch is, after all, a highly interesting per- 
sonality, which can hardly be said of Mr. Le Gal- 
lienne, and his criticism is touched here and there, 
as his fiction is, with something much like genius.

Of course, the criticism is of the subjective sort, but 
that is also true of the French criticism alluded to 
at the beginning of this notice. At any rate, it 
is literature, in its fashion, and needs no further 
excuse for being. 

The chief present interest in the re- 

The latest of eent e( j ition of The R f h 

Mr. Beardsley. f . 

Lock (imported by J. B. Lippincott 
Co. ) lies presumably in the illustrations of Aubrey 
Beardsley. Without some such help, it is to be 
feared that Pope's famous poem would hardly come 
to much of a market nowadays. It is interesting 
to think what will be the case a hundred years from 
now. Will Aubrey Beardsley continue to support 

Pope, or ? Still, Mr. Beardsley 's drawings 

are interesting ; these particular ones not less so 
because they are rather different from those that 
we have heretofore considered characteristic. Com- 
pare, if you will, the portrait of himself, of a year or 
so ago, with Belinda reading the billet-doux in the 
present volume. Or, better, compare " The Toilette 
of Salome " with " The Toilet " of Belinda. In each 
case we have a woman, a maid, and a toilet-table. 
The composition is rather different, but the chief 
difference is in the manner. Instead of the broad 
indications, the striking combinations of black and 
white, the management of large masses, we have 
painstaking attempts at drawing, judicious use of 
contemporary local color, and careful efforts at the 
rendering of materials. Indeed, this last seems to 
be the chief effort. The rendering of lace and vel- 
vet, of woodwork and tapestry, these are the artis- 
tic triumphs. Mr. Beardsley calls his work em- 
broidery ; and so it is. There are, however, some 
things even above embroidery ; the glimpse of the 
garden from the windows of Hampton Court, the 
bit of river bank on the Thames, these are rather 
more charming than anything else that we remem- 
ber of Mr. Beardsley's. Least successful of all the 
pictures is " The Cave of Spleen," where he seems 
to return to older ideas, without the older simplic- 
ity. Mr. Beardsley's early work marked an epoch, 
or rather was an epoch an epoch which is now 
perhaps farther from us than the age of Queen 
Anne. Wisely, then, does the artist disdain the 
artifices of ancient history, and proceeds with the 
times to develope as genius directs. 

The overwhelming difficulties in 
which Fran ce f ound herself after the 
catastrophe of 1870, the three-fold 
necessity of reestablishing a permanent government 
out of warring parties and factions, of paying the 
enormous indemnity exacted by Germany with the 
design of crippling her exhausted rival, and of re- 
covering her position in European politics, are all 
clearly indicated in the recent work by the Duke de 
Broglie, "An Ambassador of the Vanquished" 
(Macmillan). While this is in form an account of 
the Viscount de Gontaut-Biron's mission to Berlin, 
1871-77, it is in fact a discussion of the relations 



between Germany and France during that time. 
Like its companion volume recently reviewed in 
these columns, Count Benedetti's " Studies in Di- 
plomacy," it makes imperious Prince Bismarck its 
central figure, and presents him as a malignant plot- 
ter against poor France, ready to see in every sign 
of returning strength, and in innocent measures of 
reconstruction, only a burning desire and purpose 
of revenge. It is hardly to be expected that a public 
man of the war and reconstruction period can judge 
Bismarck justly ; and it cannot be denied that there 
is too much of truth in some of the French charges 
against him. Though he is one of the greatest states- 
men of the century, if not the greatest, his career has 
showed too much of the bully and of the unscrupulous 
schemer to be wholly admired. The Duke de Broglie 
writes with much more of calm self-possession than 
Count Benedetti, whose grievance and passion were 
too evident, and the Duke's work consequently makes 
a stronger impression than the Count's hot invec- 
tive. The liberation of the territory from German 
troops, the fall of Thiers, the failure of the scheme 
to restore the Monarchy, the Kulturkampf, the 
Eastern Question, and the final establishment of the 
Republic, with the negotiations and crises that at- 
tended these developments, are the leading topics 
of the work. 

When Minto's " Manual of English 
. Prose" was published, a great step 

was made in that rhetorical criticism 
of good authors which has of late had a consider- 
able place in the English work of our American col- 
leges. That book supplied a definite method based 
upon a very generally accepted rhetorical analysis, 
and thereby rendered far more common the useful 
inter-play of rhetorical teaching and criticism of 
literature. The idea was emphasized that one can- 
not learn to write by writing only, but that one must 
read carefully as well. In the last decade much 
work of this kind has been done, but usually by 
individual teachers, or else in one or another of the 
many editions of particular texts recently published. 
We have now, in " Studies in Structure and Style," 
by Mr. W. T. Brewster (Macmillan), a book which, 
although it has not the scope of Mr. Minto's, either 
in subject-matter or in method, has, in its more 
limited sphere, great excellence. It offers seven 
essays by recent masters of English prose, and a 
criticism upon each, both as to structure and as to 
style ; and thus it shows the way in which such 
work is done, and how it may be done with other 
authors. Its method lacks something in system, 
but gains as much in its particular applications. The 
study of structure is rather better than that of style ; 
the subject is more easily handled. But both parts 
are the result of sound and careful study, and will 
give the teacher many ideas and the student new 
insight into the possibilities of prose. The book not 
only shows what good work in English has been 
done so far in our colleges, but renders possible 
more of the same character.

The essay seems hardly one of the 
^r^Mabie staple literary forms nowadays, un- 
less explained by something special 
in treatment or thesis, something authoritative in 
the point of view. Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie 
justifies his " Essays on Nature and Culture " (Dodd) 
by the particular quality of sincerity. To him, Na- 
ture is what she was in the poetic childhood of the 
race, and what he believes she will " some day be- 
come in the vision of science a sublime analogy 
of the growth of man." Art and science are not 
strange words in his pages, but they are subservient ; 
the arts are comprehended in the art of living, and 
the sciences, over and above their material phenom- 
ena, are only making toward a finer faith in the ulti- 
mate wisdom of it all. The dedicatee of the volume, 
it is to be noted, is Mr. John Burroughs, for whom 
Mr. Mabie would hardly have concerned himself 
to collect evidences of what is evil or unadmirable 
in nature. Instead, the wonder of the growth of 
trees, the unfolding of flowers, are still miracles to 
teach the illimitable prophecies of the world, the 
" unfolding of all the possibilities of the spirit," 
which is culture. Forty years ago, in this country, 
this book would have been written very differently, 
or not at all; to-day it multiplies initiative and 
corrective influences among people who only need 
their own impulses re-worded to be wakened into 
better things. The style now and then seems to 
grow impersonal, like a sermon, and just a bit rhe- 
torical ; but that may well be because it moves on 
so high a plane. 

Of the making of French books on 
America, there has been no end since 
" Max O'Rell " set the pace for his 
compatriots with his " Brother Jonathan." So far 
as our experience goes, he who has read " Brother 
Jonathan " has virtually read the rest ; for the rest 
mainly ring the changes on their original. One is 
merely more or less smart, flippant, ejaculatory, or 
patronizing (and the spectacle of one small French- 
man patronizing this country rather recalls Mrs. 
Partington's adventure with the Atlantic), than the 
other ; and that is all. The latest Gaul to point 
his quill at us and favor us with his airy patronage 
is M. S. C. de Soissons, author of " A Parisian in 
America" (Estes & Lauriat). From this book one 
gets the impression that M. de Soissons is extremely 
well satisfied with himself arid pretty well satisfied 
with us. He treats us kindly, on the whole though 
with that " certain condescension " which we have 
long ceased to be truly thankful for, and which we 
have known to bring more than one usually sane 
citizen to the verge of Jingoism for the time being. 
Our national good-humor (despite Mr. Lodge and 
his friends) is proverbial, and Mr. Bryce has made 
much of it ; but no democratically-minded man can 
stand being patronized. Better abuse than conde- 
scension ; better the undisguised vinegar of down- 
right Mrs. Trollope, than the treacle of, say, Sir 
Edwin Arnold. M. de Soissons discusses our mil-

lionaires, newspapers, art, architecture, literature, 
music, the World's Fair, the American woman (she 
is, he says, " not only fin-de-siecle, but even more 
than that Jin-de-globe ! " ) in a sprightly, chatty 
way, and his book may be pronounced a favorable 
specimen of its class. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" Those Good Normans," by " Gyp," translated by 
Miss Marie Jussen (Rand, McNally & Co.), will prob- 
ably be found in some degree amusing by all readers. 
Although based on the not unusual theme of semi- 
wealthy people trying to make themselves considered in 
society, yet the setting, if we may so call it, as well as 
the development and the dialogue, is so cleverly man- 
aged as to be the source of much pleasure. It must be 
allowed that a good deal of the sprightly Countess's 
satire loses point if one be not somewhat familiar with 
French life; and the translation will not always, we 
think, give the right idea to one unacquainted with the 
French language. Still, the inexhaustible invention and 
cleverness of " Gyp " will overcome even these draw- 
backs, so that those for whom the translation is ob- 
viously made will probably enjoy it, while it will not 
materially injure those who could read the book in the 
original. 

Mr. Raymond A. Robbins, of Boston, is the publisher 
of the book of the " Captive " of Plautus, prepared for 
the presentation of the play last spring by the students 
of the Boston University. The book gives the Latin 
text and English translation on opposite pages; the lat- 
ter, by Professor Joseph R. Taylor, being extremely 
modern and colloquial in diction. For example: "Abi 
in malem rem, ludis me," becomes " To perdition ! 
You 're making game of me." Greek phrases are repro- 
duced in German, to get the effect of the foreign lan- 
guage. The English version is extremely readable, and 
has caught the spirit of the play most happily. 

Mr. Charles Johnston, of the Bengal Civil Service, 
has made a little volume of selections " From the 
Upanishads" (Mosher) which will be welcomed by 
amateur orientalists. They contain the very essence of 
Indian philosophy, as embodied in its deepest books. In 
a beautiful dedication to Mr. G. W. Russell (the A. E. 
of " Homeward ") the translator says of the books of 
Indian Wisdom: "I have found them wise, beyond all 
others ; and, beyond all others, filled with that very light 
which makes all things new; the light discovered first 
within, in the secret place of the heart, and which brim- 
ming over there fills the whole of life, lightening every 
dark and clouded way." It is not so much the scholar- 
ship displayed by the book as the taste shown in the 
selection and the exquisite delicacy of the English ver- 
sion that will make those cherish it into whose hands it 
may fall. 

In the series of " Periods of European History " 
(Macmillan), of which Mr. Arthur Hassall is the gen- 
eral editor, three of the eight volumes projected have 
been for some time published, and the editor himself 
now contributes the fourth, taking for his subject the 
period 1715-1789, and calling his volume " The Balance 
of Power." The history of Europe in the eighteenth 
century is at best " a tangled skein," and Mr. Hassall 
has been unusually successful in his effort to bring order 
out of the seeming chaos.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" Bar Harbor," by Mr. F. Marion Crawford, appears 
in the " American Summer Resorts " series of Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" The Facts of Life " is a book of conversational ex- 
ercises in the French language, prepared by Messrs. 
V. Be"tis and H. Swan, and published by the Scribners. 

Mark Twain's " The Prince and the Pauper " is the 
third volume in the handsome library edition of our 
chief American humorist now in course of publication 
by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Mr. W. J. Jordan has severed his connection with 
" Current Literature," and will devote himself to the 
completion of " Jordan's Guide to Poetry and Prose," 
an index of the chief English anthologies. 

Joseph Wesley Harper, who died on the 21st of July, 
at the age of sixty-six, was for many years a member of 
the firm of Harper & Brothers, being the son and name- 
sake of one of its founders. He retired from active 
business only two years ago. 

The edition of Marryatt which Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. are now publishing in this country progresses 
apace. " Japhet in Search of a Father," " The Pacha 
of Many Tales," and " Mr. Midshipman Easy " are the 
latest volumes received by us. 

Mr. S. C. Griggs, the oldest general publisher is Chi- 
cago, has retired from business on account of failing 
health, his entire stock being sold to Messrs. Scott, 
Foresman & Co. Mr. Griggs had been engaged in the 
book business in Chicago for nearly half a century. 

Charles Dickens, the son of the novelist, died on the 
20th of July, and his sister Mary on the 24th. Charles 
was editor of " All the Year Round " after his father's 
death, and, later, of " Household Words." He was very 
successful as a reader from his father's works, both in 
England and the United States. 

The Macmillan Company publish " Macbeth " and 
"Antony and Cleopatra," in the "Temple " Shakespeare; 
a concluding volume of the " Idyls of the King," and 
" The Lover's Tale," in the " People's " Tennyson; and 
Biblical Idyls " (Solomon's Song, Ruth, Esther, Tobit), 
in " The Modern Reader's Bible." 

The Right Rev. Arthur Cleveland Coxe, Bishop of 
Western New York, died on the 20th of July, at the 
age of seventy-eight. He was the author of numerous 
contributions to theological controversy, edited nine 
volumes of the " Aute-Niceue Fathers," and wrote a 
considerable quantity of religious verse. 

Miss Jane Minot Sedgwick's " Songs from the Greek," 
published by Messrs. George H. Richmond & Co., is a 
pretty little book of translations, gracefully done and 
including selections from the choruses of the tragedies, 
the fragments of Sappho, the Alexandrian poets, and 
the Anthology. All have been done before, and many 
of them better done, but the book is still welcome. 

Two new volumes in the Scribner series of " Stories 
by English Authors " have been published. They have 
for their subjects " Scotland " and " The Orient." The 
former volume leads off with Messrs. Barrie, Crockett, 
and Watson, while Aytoun, Stevenson, and Sir Walter 
bring up the rear. " The Orient " is illustrated by Mr. 
Kipling, Miss Mitford, and a number of nonentities. 

Ernst Curtius, who died on the 13th of July, had 
nearly completed his eighty-second year. He was a 
professor at Gottingen from 1856 to 1868, and after- 



wards at Berlin. He was chiefly responsible for the 
German excavations at Olympia. Besides his great 
" History of Greece," he wrote many other works in the 
department of classical history, philology, and archae- 
ology. 

The sudden death, in the prime of life, of William 
Hamilton Gibson, is a loss to American art and litera- 
ture alike. He was born October 5, 1850, and died on 
the sixteenth of last month. He first became widely 
known through the natural history articles, illustrated 
by himself, that appeared in " Harper's Magazine " 
some years ago. These articles, and others, were after- 
wards collected in a number of the most charming books 
of natural history ever written, of which " Sharp Eyes " 
and " Nature's Serial Story " are perhaps the best 
known. His last book was the beautifully illustrated 
volume on " Our Edible Mushrooms," one of the most 
conspicuous holiday publications of the past season. 

We are glad to call the attention of our readers to 
the " Cumulative Index to a Selected List of Period- 
icals," now being issued in monthly parts by the Cleve- 
land Public Library. Over fifty English and American 
periodicals are regularly indexed, while important arti- 
cles in a number of others will also be noted. The " In- 
dex " is on the plan of a dictionary catalogue, authors 
and subjects being included in a single alphabet. The 
most valuable feature of this work is, however, that 
indicated by the first word of the title. Each monthly 
issue of the " Index " will contain not only the entries 
for that particular mouth, but also all the others that 
have accumulated during the year. Thus, the Decem- 
ber number will refer to the contents of the selected 
periodicals for the entire year. Although publication 
of the work began with June, it is promised that the 
issue for next December shall be for the year 1896 com- 
plete. This plain statement of the work to be done by 
the " Index " will show, better than any words of praise, 
how great a help it will be to all literary workers, and 
how deserving of support is the enterprise. 

William Henry Smith, author of "The St. Clair Pa- 
pers " and other historical works, died at his home in 
Lake Forest, 111., July 27, in his sixty-third year. Mr. 
Smith was a life-long student of history, especially the 
political history of his own country, with which he was 
very familiar, and on which he made numerous contri- 
butions to the magazines and periodicals, including 
many valuable reviews in the pages of THE DIAL. He 
was also a life-long journalist, one of the better class 
whose work and influence can ill be spared from Amer- 
ican journalism. He began as editor of a country news- 
paper in Ohio the friend and fellow- worker of Mr. 
W. D. Howells in that humble field, and rose to the 
position of General Manager of the Associated Press, 
which he held for over twenty years, resigning it in 
1893 in order to devote his time to the historical work 
that so much engaged his scholarly interest. The rest and 
relief from business which he had so long promised him- 
self came, however, too late; his health, already under- 
mined, failed rapidly under the shock of the loss of his 
wife and daughter, occurring in swift succession. His 
death leaves unfinished the most important work of his 
life, " The Political History of the United States," as 
also a life of President Hayes, whose literary executor 
he was. Mr. Smith had seen much of public life and 
men, having been Secretary of State of Ohio during the 
Civil War, and Collector of the Port of Chicago from 
1877 to 1883. He was a man of singular elevation of 
character, and of dignified and engaging personality.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE IL 

The German writers most talked about at 
the present day are the dramatists Herr Suder- 
mann and Herr Hauptmann. At least, this is 
the opinion of Dr. Zimmermann, who opens his 
annual summary of German literature with a 
discussion of their latest works. The former 
has produced "Das Gliick im Winkel," a great 
success, while the " Florian Geyer " of the lat- 
ter has proved a comparative failure. Herr 
Sudermann's play deals with a modern and 
domestic theme, presenting a problem, and 
leaving us in doubt as to whether it has been 
solved or not. " Florian Geyer," on the other 
hand, is a historical drama, the subject being 
taken from the Peasants' War of 1525. The 
work suggests " Gbtz von Berlichingen," and 
the two plays are thus contrasted : 

" Both the men who gave their name to the plays 
were leaders in the Peasants' War one of them, Florian 
von Geyer, by his own desire, the other, Gotz, in spite 
of himself. The former, who was really desirous to 
reform society, both in its head and members, remained 
with the peasants in good and ill fortune, and sacrificed 
life and property to their cause; the latter, a mere im- 
promptu knight, deserted the cause of the peasants, and 
in the last decisive battle against the troops of the 
Swabian league at Konigshofen beat a disgraceful re- 
treat. In comparison with ' Gotz,' Hauptmann's play 
has historical accuracy in its favor, Goethe's poetic 
probability. Goethe's play acquires dramatic vigour and 
human interest by the interweaving of the Peasants' 
War with the family and love relations of Weisslingen 
and Adelheid. Hauptmann's, which clings with slavish 
accuracy to historic facts, and even models its language 
on the now unfamiliar speech of that day, leaves the 
impression of an historical chronicle in dialogue, and 
has a stunted and uninteresting effect." 

A third important play, also historical, comes 
from Herr Ernst von Wildenbrach, and is 
called " Heinrich und Sein Geschlecht." It is 
a trilogy, and the performance requires two 
evenings. In it " idealism in the sense of the 
classsic ancients, so much opposed to the ex- 
treme realism of the moderns, has won a tri- 
umph," says our writer. Turning to the sub- 
ject of poetry we read the following interesting 
statement : 

" In the domain of epic poetry the appearance of a 
work of the extent, and, in spite of some excrescences, 
the profundity, of ' Robespierre,' by the youthful poet- 
ess Marie Eugenie delle Grazie, which came out last 



80 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



year, has driven all rivals out of the field for a long while 
to come. In the lyric domain also the publication of 
the same author's collected poems secures for her the 
first place in the year's literature." 

Herr Martin Greif has begun an issue of his 
collected poems ; we read that as a lyric writer 
he " occupies a foremost place, and though 
building on a loftier summit, he is akin to the 
unartificial comrades who, like Hans Sachs, 
spring from the ranks of the people more closely 
akin to nature from the artisan, peasant, or 
even servant class." A word is also said of 
the sacred poetry of the peasant woman, Frau 
Johanna Ambrosius, and of the posthumous 
success of F. W. Weber's " Dreizehn Linden," 
which is even compared with that of Scheffel's 
famous " Trompeter." The most noteworthy 
fiction of the year has been " Im Blauen Hecht," 
by Dr. Ebers ; " Chlodovech," by Herr Felix 
Dahn ; " Ueber Allen Gipfeln," by Herr 
Heyse ; " Kittmeister Brandt," by Frau von 
Ebner-Eschenbach ; and an unnamed novel by 
Herr Spielhagen. The novel of Dr. Ebers 
" takes its title from the name of the inn, ' Zum 
blauen Hecht,' at Miltenberg, in Franconia, 
whence sprang Friedrich Weygand, the man 
who drew up for the peasants under the leader- 
ship of Florian Geyer the future constitution of 
the German nation. . . . Ebers is always suc- 
cessful in imparting local and temporal color- 
ing to his stories ; the stiffness tiresome at 
times so characteristic of his revenants from 
the ages of the Pharaohs and Ptolemies, is 
exchanged in this work, as in the previous one 
dealing with a German imperial city, for an 
attractive fluency of style and characterization." 
On the other hand, " Chlodovech " is said to be 
heavily ballasted with historic and archa3olog- 
ical learning. It is another story of the Volker- 
wanderung. The " Mutter " of Frau Goswine 
von Berlepsch and the " Seine Gottheit " of 
Frau Emilie Mataja are also novels deserving 
of mention. Weimar, once the literary metrop- 
olis, has now become the literary necropolis of 
Germany. " Owing to the establishment by 
the present Grand Duchess of the Goethe and 
Schiller Archive, it has become the lasting 
treasure-house of the most precious heritage of 
German genius. The national undertaking, 
unique in its kind, of an absolutely complete 
collection of the works of the poet of ' Faust,' 
at the head of which stands the Grand Duchess 
herself as heir to all the literary and artistic 
works left behind by Goethe, assumes larger 
dimensions every year. The Goethe Society, 
working with untiring energy, adds new treas- 



ures annually to the seemingly inexhaustible 
supply of Goethe literature, partly by means of 
its annual ' Jahrbuch,' partly by original pub- 
lications." The latest volume of the great 
" Sophia " edition of Goethe (the eighteenth) 
" contains a newly discovered fragment of a 
drama hitherto unknown, which was to bear the 
title ' Das Madchen von Oberkirch,' the action 
being laid in Alsace at the time of the French 
Revolution ; but of this only a few scenes were 
written. This serves as a fresh proof of the 
care which Goethe, the ' unpolitical poet,' de- 
voted to the poetical aspect of the greatest polit- 
ical event of his century." A new life of Goethe, 
by Herr Albert Bielschowsky, has been partly 
published, and " comes forward with the de- 
clared intention of supplying a complete sub- 
stitute for the most vivid of Goethe biographies 

that by G. H. Lewes, which has now become 
antiquated, in fact and driving it from the 
position it holds with general readers and Ger- 
man families." The " Ausgewahlte Briefe " of 
Strauss is one of the books of the year. 

" These letters, addressed for the most part to his 
friend Vischer, extend from his twenty-second year 
(1830) to his death in 1874, and thus include nearly the 
whole of his life. General readers will be specially 
interested in those which refer to the pugnacious schol- 
ar's passionate affection for the opera singer Agnes 
Schebest, Juno-like both inwardly and outwardly, and 
his marriage with her, which, happy at first, degenerated 
afterwards into tragedy. The mixture of harshness and 
softness so characteristic of the Swabian disposition ap- 
pears as an inherited racial characteristic in the writer 

the uncompromising intellect whose critical faculty 
knows no limits, and an over-tender heart which any un- 
wonted breath causes to withdraw, wounded, into itself. 
The latter then finds vent in appropriate poetic effu- 
sions, which are scattered throughout the letters, and 
reveal in the great stylist, whose prose is among the best 
of which the German language can boast, a poet who 
excels in feeling as much as in form." 

The letters of Count von Roon to Perthes, and 
of Lassalle to Herwegh, have also been pub- 
lished, and are of much interest. It is also 
worth noting that Herr B. von Simson has 
added a sixth volume to Giesebrecht's great 
but incomplete " Geschichte der Deutschen 
Kaiserzeit," giving the history of Friedrich 
Barbarossa as suggested by fragments left by 
Giesebrecht. 

The story of literary Holland is told this year 
by Heer H. S. M. van Wickevoort Crommelin. 
In poetry, there is Heer van Eeden's " Lied 
van Schijn en Wezen," a striking philosophical 
production, and volumes of lyrics by a number 
of writers. In philosophy there is Heer Meins- 
ma's monograph on Spinoza, as well as two 
translations of the " Ethica." There is also 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



81 



Dr. Jelgersma's " De Ontkenning der Moraal," 
a defence of conventional morality against the 
theories of Nietzsche and Ibsen. The most 
important novel of the year is the " Wereld- 
vrede " of Heer Couperus, a sequel to- " Ma- 
jesteit." 

" Othomar thinks he has found out what the world 
requires peace. This blessing he will bestow on his 
people, and he convokes a congress for international 
arbitration, which he opens under the enthusiastic ap- 
plause of the multitude. But Liparia is no Utopia, and 
as soon as the enthusiasm, in which a strong element of 
imitation and fashion plays its part, has died away, the 
people find that all the fine phrases uttered and all the 
words wasted have not lightened their burdens in the 
least. Instead of universal peace ensuing, an insurrec- 
tion breaks out in Othomar's dominions, and the em- 
peror has to extinguish his ideals in the blood of his 
own people." 

Other works of fiction are " Martha," by Dr. 
Aletrino ; " Zijn Kind," by Heer van Nouhuys ; 
" De Vreemde Plant," by Herr Phocius ; and 
two historical novels in the period of the French 
Revolution, by Professor ten Brink. There 
seems to be nothing else in the report from 
Holland that is deserving of special mention. 

Passing to the Scandinavian countries, we 
notice with regret that Sweden is not included 
in the " Athenaeum " summaries of this year. 
Denmark, however, is dealt with by Herr Alfred 
Ipsen, and Norway by Herr Christian Brinch- 
mann. Outside of belles-lettres, Denmark has 
produced, few notable books. The most impor- 
tant, of course, is the great monograph on 
Shakespeare by Dr. Georg Brandes. As Mr. 
Archer has translated this work into English, 
it is sure of finding a large public. Dr. Alfred 
Lehmann's work " On Superstition and Witch- 
craft " is also of much importance. 

" It is in many respects founded on the records of the 
English Society for Psychical Research, without the aid 
of which the author could never have undertaken his 
task, though he has made a good many experiments on 
his own account. The author is devoting almost a whole 
volume to Spiritualism, which he considers partly as the 
result of self-suggestion, and partly as the outcome of 
tricks played by conscious impostors, although he ad- 
mits that there are phenomena which cannot yet be 
explained from natural causes. He mentions the experi- 
ments of thought-transmission by Professor Sidgwick, 
but Dr. Lehmann is a skeptic regarding the explanation 
of them." 

Coming to the subject of literature proper, the 
writer says : 

" In general it must be said that the earlier form of 
realistic naturalism is slowly vanishing, or perhaps 
rather changing into something new. Even the leaders 
seem to feel that nothing more can be done that way. 
At the present moment there is less dogmatism in lit- 
erature than we have had for many a long year. Every- 
body may do what he likes, and if he is doing it well 



may expect to find an audience. There is a change of 
taste slowly going on, and much experimenting both in 
art and literature. Now and then the word symbolism 
is thrown into the discussion by one or other of the ex- 
perimenters, but there is no symbolistic school worth 
speaking of. There is no fixed line, indeed, between old 
and new, only a tendency." 

Herr Jorgensen, a new writer who has recently 
become a convert to Romanism, "has written a 
most beautiful book, ' Rejsebogen,' in which he 
gives delicate pictures from old mediaeval Ger- 
man and Italian cities in a noble style, whose 
serenity recalls the painting of the old mas- 
ters." Herr Drachmann, who is now living 
abroad, " this year celebrates the completion of 
twenty-five years of authorship." He has pub- 
lished " Kitzwalde," a mediaeval novel, and a 
volume of " Melodramer." Other books are 
Herr Pontoppidan's " Dommens Dag," Herr 
Michaelis's "^Ebelo," Herr Peter Nansen's 
" Gud's Fred," and Herr Carl Evald's " Den 
Gamle Stue," a story of emancipated woman. 
" A young poet, Ludvig Holstein, has made a 
mark in literature with a beautiful volume of 
melodious verse, bright as the sunshine of 
May." 

Norway, it seems, has little but fiction to 
offer this year, although the greatest event 
chronicled is Herr Bjornson's play, the second 
part of " Over JSvne." 

" Twelve years ago appeared the first part. There he 
had forced us to realize the suffering involved in utter 
abandonment of self, over and beyond natural capacity, 
in the cause of religious enthusiasm. Now, in this sec- 
ond part, he leads us to feel with the political dreamers, 
themselves the offspring of those older martyrs who 
believed in miracles, their despair of any solution of the 
social questions, pointing, as they seem to do, to another 
fruitless martyrdom. Bjornson has produced a drama 
of overwhelming force and effect, marked by varied 
delineation of human characteristics and clear analysis 
of social problems, and also full of genuine pathos and 
poetical touches. Weighed in a balance, it would turn 
the scale against most of our modern tragedies." 

Dr. Ibsen has published nothing, but his plays 
appear with biennial regularity, and one may 
be expected the coming winter. Herr Lie's 
" When the Sun Sets " " deals with the disas- 
trous influence on a home of the wife's infi- 
delity, and shows at the end how the husband, 
at last suspecting his wife's proceedings, ar- 
ranges matters in such a way that the next 
time she goes to meet her lover she cannot fail 
to meet also certain death." Among works of 
scholarship, we may mention the " Dictionary 
of Norwegian Dialects," by Herr Ross, the late 
Eivind Astrup's book on the Peary Expedition, 
Herr Olsvig's discussion of Holberg's indebt- 
edness to English writers, and the essays of

Herr Nils Kjaer, which place the author in the 
forefront of Norwegian critics. 

The Hungarian books of the year seem to 
have been " Fatum," a novel of Transylvanian 
life by Miss Janka Horvath ; " The Lublo 
Ghost, and Other Stories," by Mr. Kalman 
Mikszath ; and " Honthy's House," a play by 
Mr. Ferencz Herczeg, who brings out at least 
one new book every year. The Millenial Cele- 
bration has called forth " Millenial Hungary," 
" a highly interesting and splendidly got-up 
descriptive publication in four languages, En- 
glish among the rest." Four volumes of the 
great " History of the Magyar Nation " have 
already appeared, and two or three more are to 
follow. Herr Katscher says in a general way 
of modern Hungarian literature that it " is 
characterized, not by the towering qualities of 
a single leading personality, but by what might 
be called a popular spirit approximating to 
general European forms, subjects, and styles. 
Young Hungary must be estimated by its total 
production, instead of by one or two names." 

The three Slavonic literatures remain to be 
considered, but we have space for only little con- 
cerning them. The Bohemian literature of the 
present day, writes Dr. Tille, " is characterized 
not so much by the actual works produced as 
by a movement which, although going on for 
some time, was never so marked as during the 
past year. This movement, which I should like 
to call 'youthful impulse,' is not confined to 
any one class ; it is to be observed in all our 
literary circles, and varies in its principles and 
tendencies in different individualities and par- 
ties. Only one feature is common to all : the 
desire for a regeneration of literature, for re- 
formation, for new and better tendencies." The 
young men are trying to start a Theatre libre 
in Prague, and sustain several periodicals for 
the furtherance of their aims and theories. 
" Vina," a drama by Mr. Hilbert, a new writer, 
"may be counted the best written in Bohemian." 

The most interesting news from Poland is 
that Mr. Sienkiewicz has published a three- 
volume novel, " Quo Vadis ? " of which the 
" first persecution of the Christians at Rome 
forms the background. Individual episodes, 
such as the burning of Rome, the gladiatorial 
combats, the martyr death of the Christians in 
the circus, etc., are brilliant and described with 
wonderful plastic power, and the extremely 
numerous dramatis personce, mostly historical 
figures, are as notable for psychological truth 
as for fidelity to fact." Madame Orzeszko, a 
writer of some thirty years' standing, has added 



three books to her long list : " An Australian," 
a novel ; " Melancholy Beings," a collection of 
stories ; and " The Interrupted Song," " the 
prettiest tale " she has ever written. The long 
list of other books given in Mr. Belcikowski's 
enumeration contains nothing of noteworthy 
interest, and must be passed over. 

Mr. Paul Milyoukov opens his article by 
saying : 

" I can only liken the condition of Russian society 
this year to a river whose current has been suddenly 
stopped by some insuperable obstacle. The stream has 
not been sufficiently strong to break down the dam, nor 
so weak as to be stopped entirely, and thus by over- 
flowing the banks, to turn the surrounding country into 
a swamp." 

This is sufficiently discouraging, but seems to 
be borne out by the facts. What he says of the 
controversy raging between " Populists " and 
" Marxites " may be quoted : 

" The first adhere to the old idea that the primitive 
collectivism of Russia is destined to become the founda- 
tion of the future structure of Russian industrialism; 
while the others maintain that ' Russia is no exception 
to other European countries, and must, like them, take 
leave of the period of natural cultivation, in which alone 
primitive forms of collective property-holding can be 
retained.' " 

In the field of pure literature, he says, " this 
year has been one of the most barren. A large 
number of well-known authors have presented 
us with their works, but there is not a single 
remarkable production amongst them." Some 
remarks upon the writings of Mr. Volynski are 
interesting for the light thrown upon criticism 
in Russia. 

" In his bulky volume on ' Russian Critics,' Volynski 
endeavored in vain to turn public sympathy away from 
our veteran journalistic critics Belinski, Dobrolioubov, 
and Pissareff and to prove that these old favorites of 
the public had an inadequate philosophic equipment for 
their task. In reality Russian readers never valued 
highly any Russian critic who was the champion of any 
aesthetic theory, however philosophically grounded. 
Thanks to the melancholy conditions of Russian society, 
which still continue, the Russian critic, under cover of 
sestheticism, has always been a publicist, compelled to 
sail under a strange flag, and thus smuggle into print 
his contraband political and social opinions. Thus the 
very faults with which Volynski reproaches our critics, 
and which would be serious defects in any society where 
a normal public opinion existed, are regarded as their 
principal merits by Russian readers."

TALES or TRAVEL, AND ADVENTURE.* 

No better book of sporting lore and reminis- 
cence has fallen in our way since the day when 
a happy chance buried us for an entire half- 
holiday afternoon in the breezy pages of old 
" Christopher in his Sporting Jacket " than 
Mr. W. A. Baillie-Grohman's finely illustrated 
" Sport in the Alps," an account of the chase 
of the red-deer, chamois, bouquetin, roe-deer, 
capercaillie, and black-cock, in the Central, 
Eastern, and Italian Alps. Mr. Baillie-Groh- 
man is a veteran hunter his acquaintance 
with the " deadly tube " dating from the time 
when as an urchin of seven he loaded a thimble 
(with touch-hole drilled in the bottom) with 
grains of " villainous saltpetre " pilfered from 
the paternal gun-room, and discharged the 
same, with delightful effect, against the glass 
panes of the nursery book-case. Copious as is 
the literary outcome of " Alpinism," no consid- 
erable attempt has been made hitherto to write 
of the Alps strictly from the point of view of 
the sportsman ; and this void it was Mr. Baillie- 
Grohman's aim to supply. The Swiss Alps are 
left almost unnoticed, for the simple reason that 
but few chamois and no red-deer whatever are 
now to be found there. Republicanism and 
game-preserving assort ill together, constitu- 
tional regard for the Rights of Man securing 
to each free-born countryman of Jean Jacques 
Rousseau, from landowner to landlouper, his 
natural and inalienable right to carry a gun 
and to shoot therewith what he pleases where 
he pleases a policy which, while soothing 
to democratic sensibilities, naturally resulted 
in the speedy extinction of game. To the 
Swiss " proletarian," then, is left the dog-in- 
the-manger satisfaction of knowing that, if 
there is no game for him, neither is there any

for his supposed social superiors. To some 
proud spirits this is doubtless true joy. Mr. 
Baillie-Grohman (who has consorted much 
with Grafs, Herzogs, and so on) seems to be 
aristocratical enough in his notions to think it 
expedient that the killing of game in a country 
like Switzerland should be mainly the privi- 
lege of the class whose interests and instincts 
lead them to kill it in a rational and sports- 
manlike way, and to eschew the ruthless meth- 
ods of the vulgar pot-hunter but this smacks 
of heresy nowadays. Mr. Baillie-Grohman's 
book is too diversified in matter to be fairly 
exhibited here ; but the following captions may 
help to indicate its general scope and trend : 
" Chamois-hunting in the Old Days "; " What 
the Chamois is Like "; " Chamois-stalking in 
Peasants' Shoots "; " Stalking the Alpine 
Deer "; " Stalking Red-Deer in Hungary "; 
" The Bouquetin and its Chase," etc. One of 
the best chapters contains some sporting rem- 
iniscences of the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg 
a mighty hunter, a just prince, a liberal Ma3- 
cenas, and withal a true friend and father of 
his people, who rejoiced in his prowess and will 
long keep his memory green by the recital of 
his deeds and benefactions. The Duke was a 
superb shot ; and the ring of his favorite .450 
Henry Express rifle was the sure knell of many 
and many a royal " harte of grease " and stag 
of ten. Once the author saw him bring down, 
with two double shots, four stags in full flight, 
the nearest of them over two hundred yards 
away. He died in 1893 perhaps a not alto- 
gether edifying example of the strength of the 
ruling passion ; for his last words were, " Let 
the drive commence ! " The good " Herr Her- 
zog " was lamented far and wide by the hardy 
mountain people, whose rugged tastes and sin- 
ewy virtues of mind and body he had, and even 
embodied. Though above them, he was of 
them ; and they loved him accordingly. As the 
author was boarding the train, on his way to 
attend the Duke's funeral at Coburg, at a moun- 
tain station near the Hinter-Riss, a bare-legged 
little peasant girl, pale with fatigue, hurried up 
to him, pressed a bunch of toil-won Alpine gen- 
tians and rhododendrons into his hand, saying : 
" ' They are the only ones I could find still in bloom,

Please put them on the. Herr Herzog's coffin he was

of half-withered Alpine flowers was certainly the hum- 
blest. But I know which would have pleased the dead 
prince most." 

An excellent publication is the handsome 
volume styled (not very luminously) "From 
North Pole to Equator," being an English 
translation of the lectures, recently collected 
and published in Germany, of the lamented 
German naturalist-traveller, Alfred Edmund 
Brehm, author of " Bird Life " and the classic 
" Tierleben." To the translation has been 
added an introductory essay on the author and 
his work, an extended table of contents, an ap- 
pendix containing some useful editorial notes, 
and a fair index. For range, charm, and va- 
riety, and as an example of picturesque pre- 
sentation of ordered scientific observations in 
natural history, the book seems to us unsur- 
passed by any work of its kind and scope. 
Comparing Brehm with Humboldt, the editor 
justly observes that we find in some of the 
latter's Charakterbilder, for example in his 
" Views of Nature," " the prototype of those 
synthetic pictures which give Brehm's popular 
lectures their peculiar value." Brehra's de- 
scriptions of scenery, and of animal life and 
traits as seen in nature, are of the clear-cut 
order that imprint themselves durably on the 
mind as the seal stamps the wax. Once read, 
they are retained, and become part of one's 
intellectual furniture. Brehm (1829-1884) 
was born at Unter - Renthendorf, Sachsen- 
Weimar, where his father, an accomplished 
ornithologist, was pastor. Brought up in an 
atmosphere of bird-lore, and accustomed to at- 
tend his father on his specimen-hunting tramps 
in the Thuringian forest, young Brehm insen- 
sibly and inevitably became a naturalist hap- 
pily not one of the mere Dryasdust sort, his 
inborn love of the poetic and the picturesque 
being nourished and kept alive by his mother, 
who used to enliven the evenings' bird-stuff- 
ing and specimen-mounting operations at the 
JPfarr-haus by reading aloud from Goethe and 
Schiller. In 1847 Brehm accompanied Baron 
von Miiller on an ornithological expedition to 
Africa, returning in 1852, rich in spoils and 
experience, if poor in coin, to spend several 
sessions at the universities of Jena and Vienna. 
In 1855 he took his doctor's degree, publishing 
in the same year his " Relseskizzen aus Nor- 
dostafrika." Early in 1861, after a zoological 
trip in Spain, he settled for a time at Leipzig, 
writing there for the " Gartenlaube" teaching, 
and composing his " Bird Life." The monu- 
mental " Tierleben " was begun, after an expe- 



dition to Abyssinia, in 1863, and completed in 
1869. Meanwhile, Brehm had served at Ham- 
burg as Director of the Zoological Gardens, 
and at Berlin in establishing the famous Aqua- 
rium which partly realized his pet project of 
" a microcosmic living museum of nature. Ill- 
health, social friction, and strained business 
relations forced him to throw up his position, 
and he again took up the role of popular lec- 
turer, for which he was eminently qualified. 
His literary pursuits and lecturing were inter- 
rupted by his Siberian journeys and by occa- 
sional ornithological expeditions, notably those 
to Spain and Hungary, along with the Crown 
Prince Rudolph of Austria." But hard work, 
family sorrows, and finally, perhaps, the strain of 
a long lecturing tour in America, aged Brehm 
before his time, and he died in 1884. The fol- 
lowing passage from the characteristic chapter 
on " Love and Courtship among Birds " illus- 
trates Brehm's manner, as well as his tendency, 
noted by the editor, to read the man perhaps 
unduly into the beast. 

" All birds with a voice utter clear, articulate notes 
in their courtship, and their song is nothing more than a 
supplication of love. . . . He (the male bird) is a poet, 
who, within his own limits, invents, creates, and strug- 
gles for utterance; and the motive throughout is love 
for the opposite sex. Dominated by this love, the jay 
sings, whistles, and murmurs, the magpie chatters, the 
croaking raven transforms its rough sounds into gentle, 
soft notes, the usually silent grebe lets its voice be 
heard, the diver sings its wild yet tuneful ocean-song, 
the bittern dips its bill under water that the only cry at 
its command may become a dull, far-sounding booming. 
. . . The bee-eater, whose voice is also unmelodious, 
sits for a long time on his perch, pressing closely to his 
mate, uttering scarcely a sound, but apparently content- 
ing himself with casting tender glances from his beau- 
tiful bright red eyes; but he, too, takes fire, moves his 
wings abruptly, rises high into the air, describes a circle, 
utters a jubilant cry, and returns to his mate. . . . 
Tree-pipits and rock-pipits, white-throats, and garden- 
warblers behave exactly like the doves ; the wood- 
warblers precipitate themselves from their high perches 
without ceasing to sing, fly up again to another branch, 
where they finish their song, to begin it again a few 
minutes later, and bring it to a conclusion with a similar 
play of wings. Greenfinches, siskins, and common bunt- 
ings, in the enthusiasm of love, tumble in the air as if 
they had no control over their wings; the larks soar to 
heaven singing their song of love; the serin behaves as 
if it had taken lessons from a bat. . . . And such be- 
havior is only the movement of a machine obedient to 
some external guiding force ? All these expressions of 
a warm and living emotion which we have depicted 
occur without consciousness ? Believe that who can, 
maintain it who will. We believe and maintain the op- 
posite; the conscious happiness of the love and wedded 
life of birds appears to us worthy of our envy."

and their Fauna," " The Steppes of Inner

Africa," " Migrations of Mammals," " Apes 
and Monkeys," "A Journey in Siberia," " The 
Heathen Ostiaks," " Family Life among the 
Kirghiz," etc. The work contains a great num- 
ber of woodcuts from original drawings. 

" The Downfall of Prempeh," consisting of 
the diary of Major R. S. Baden-Powell, re- 
counts briefly the events of the recent British 
military expedition against the King of the 
Ashantis. Major Baden-Powell was in com- 
mand of the native levy ; and he prefaces his 
narrative with a pungent chapter, intended to 
make short work of the cavils of Mr. Cham- 
berlain's " hecklers," setting forth the reasons 
for the undertaking, which were briefly these : 

" To put a stop to human sacrifice. To put an end to 
slave-trading and raiding. To ensure peace and security 
for the neighboring tribes. To settle the country and 
protect the growth of trade. To get paid up the bal- 
ance of the war indemnity." 

That there were other and more vital reasons 
than these unimpeachable ones, some rather 
naive admissions in the Major's amazing pre- 
face lead one to suspect. After quoting with 
approval the Gold Coast motto, " Softly, softly, 
catchee monkey," he goes on to say, with an 
effrontery which is enough to send our Jingo 
statesmen into fresh spasms: 

" By quietly taking possession of Ashanti, it has prac- 
tically acquired the vast Hinterland beyond it has 
softly caught the monkey. And the principle is being 
carried out in all quarters of the world. In Siam, in 
Venezuela, and up the Nile, England goes softly, softly, 
catching her monkey." 

Thus do the worst suspicions of our Jingo 
friends meet confirmation assuming the au- 
thor to speak by the book. The Ashanti expe- 
dition ended, as we know, prosperously in the 
abject submission of King Prempeh, who em- 
braced the knees of the envoy, and promised to 
abstain from slave-driving and his pet diver- 
sion of sacrificial slaughter for the future. 
There was no fight, much to the regret of the 
humane Major Baden-Powell, who asserts that 
he was u spoiling " for one throughout. How 
he might have felt about it had the delinquents 
marched against been Oom Paul and his sharp- 
shooting boers, instead of King Prempeh and his 
"niggers," is a question ; for the Transvaal has 
fallen into some disrepute as a parade-ground 
for British valor of late. Reading the Major's 
account of Prempeh, we ourselves rather regret 
that there was no fight ; for the Ashanti chief 
seems to be a most faithless, bloody-minded 
rascal ; and it is clear that (as Mr. Lincoln 
was once driven to say of a peculiarly pestilent 
rebel or was it place-hunter ?) " a little shoot- 



ing might do him good." Kumassi (the " death- 
place "), Prempeh's capital, was literally a 
Golgotha, possessing three places of execution, 
where the knife was seldom idle, and " two 
blocks of houses occupied entirely by the exe- 
cutioners." Any public function served as the 
pretext for human sacrifices ; but if the king 
wanted some entertainment of the kind between- 
whiles, he did not look far for an excuse. De- 
siring on one occasion a richer color in the red 
stucco on the walls of his palace, he is said to 
have used as a vehicle the blood of four hundred 
virgins (presumably captives) for the purpose. 
At Bantama, a sacred village devoted to fetish 
sacrifices, was found the famous execution- 
bowl, described by Bowdich in his account of 
Kumassi in 1817 : 

" It is a large brass basin some five feet in diameter. 
It is ornamented with four small lions, and a number of 
round knobs all round its rim, except at one part, where 
there is a space for the victim's neck to rest on the edge. 
The blood of the victims was allowed to putrefy in the 
bowl, and leaves of certain herbs being added, it was 
considered a valuable fetish medicine." 

Inured thus to slaughter, it is no wonder that 
the Ashantis became imbued with a consuming 
blood-lust, a wholesale execution being for them 
as alluring a spectacle as is a bull-fight to a 
Spaniard or a foot-ball match to an English- 
man. They were decidedly a people to be re- 
pressed, to be forced under the sway of the Pax 
Britannica whatever we may think of John 
Bull's concurrent policy of " softly, softly " 
insinuating the germ of a claim to the " vast 
Hinterland beyond." Prempeh's overthrow was 
peaceably accomplished ; but Major Baden- 
Powell's account of him almost makes one wish 
there had been a little expiatory blood-letting. 
The book contains some striking illustrations. 
Sir John Lubbock's compact volume on 
" The Scenery of Switzerland " is sure of its 
welcome among intelligent readers generally, 
and should prove a true boon to Alpine tour- 
ists. Swiss scenery has been duly described, 
sung, and apostrophized ; but it has not, we 
believe, heretofore been explained not, that 
is, for the direct behoof of the general reader. 
One's enjoyment of it must needs be enhanced 
by a fair conception of the forces to which it is 
due, which have raised the mountains, hollowed 
out the lakes, and guided the rivers even if 
such knowledge bring with it a melancholy 
inkling of the inevitable outcome of the slow 
but potent counter-forces of denudation which 
must in time efface the rugged grandeur of the 
Alpine country, and pare down Mont Blanc 
and the Jungfrau to the level of Snowdon or

Helvellyn. For the Alps themselves, the time- 
honored types of eternity, are ephemeral too 
though their day, measured with our brief span, 
seems a long one. They have already, says the 
author, " undergone enormous denudation, and 
it has been shown that from the summit of 
Mont Blanc some ten to twelve thousand feet 
of strata have been already removed." The 
summer of 1861 was spent by Sir John in 
Switzerland with his friends Huxley and Tyn- 
dall ; and since that date his vacation jaunts 
have usually been to the Alps. Thus he be- 
came interested in the problems offered by the 
physical geography of the country ; and it oc- 
curred to him that a book presenting in pop- 
ular style the latest conclusions of the best 
thinkers on those problems would be desirable. 
The present volume is the fruit of this idea ; 
and it should be in the hands of every Alpine 
tourist with a mind above Baedeker mean- 
ing, of course, no slur on that excellent and 
indispensable finger-post. With Baedeker as 
guide and Sir John as philosopher and friend, 
the pilgrim to the land of Tell may cheerfully 
hope to make the most of his journey. The 
book is at once entertaining and instructive 
like other works of the author's, a happy blend- 
ing of the popular and the technical. 

One of the finest works in our present group 
is Mr. E. A. Fitzgerald's " Climbs in the New 
Zealand Alps " a superbly made book which 
inadequate space compels us to pass over much 
too briefly. It is a simple record of explora- 
tion and adventure, a tale of the privations, 
difficulties, hazards, and triumphs of moun- 
taineering, of the sort which the kindred ac- 
counts of Mr. Whymper, Sir Martin Conway, 
and others have made us pretty familiar with. 
The author was accompanied by our old friend 
Mr. Zurbriggen, the famous Swiss guide who so 
materially assisted Sir M. Conway in the Kara- 
koram Himalayas. The most noteworthy climb 
was that of Mt. Sefton, in the course of which 
the author narrowly missed falling down an 
abyss of some six thousand feet. A plate ac- 
companying the account of this lucky escape 
shows Mr. Fitzgerald dangling at the end of an 
alarmingly thin-looking rope over the gorge 
(down which his only hat is placidly sailing), 
like the samphire-gatherer in " Lear," or a cap- 
tive cockchafer on a thread a most parlous 
predicament which ought to have cured him of 
the " mountain-fever " forever. Mts. Sealy, 
Tasman, Haidinger, and the Silberhorn were 
also scaled. The story of the whole is admir- 
ably told, Mr. Fitzgerald falling in this respect 



in no wise behind his distinguished prototypes. 
A decided feature of the work is the illustra- 
tions, consisting of finely reproduced drawings 
by Joseph Pennell, H. Gr. Willink, and A. D. 
McCormick. A large map of the Southern 
Alps of New Zealand from the latest govern- 
ment survey, with additions by the author, is 
enclosed in a pocket in the cover.

How PEOPLE LEARN TO COUNT.* 

Everyone who has read Tylor's " Primitive 
Culture " must have been delighted with the 
chapter on the Art of Counting. In his work 
on " The Number Concept," Dr. Conant goes 
much more fully into the subject, and undoubt- 
edly brings together the greatest amount of 
illustrative material ever gathered. It appears 
quite certain that primitive man must have had 
extremely vague and meagre number concep- 
tions ; peoples even yet exist who have no words 
for numbers beyond two or three, indeed, it 
is asserted that the Bolivian Chiquitos have no 
real numerals at all, expressing simply the idea 
of unity by a word meaning alone, etama. It 
is quite possible that some animals have as clear 
a notion of number differences as have the De- 
mara, the Chiquito, and some Australians. 

From such poor beginnings of mathematical 
power man has moved onward. Many peoples, 
to keep their count straight and to focus atten- 
tion, have used their fingers and toes as tallies. 
While this has been and is common, curious 
differences exist in the exact method employed. 
After a discussion of counting in general, our 
author investigates the " Limits of Number 
Systems." South America, Australia, and 
some South Sea Islands, show limits soon 
reached. Many peoples stop their count at two, 
some go to three, a multitude do not pass ten. 
Curiously, a considerable number of Australian 
tribes can count four, but do not go to the (to 
us) very natural five. Still some " savage " 
races (the word is Dr. Conant's) go far in num- 
ber. " In the great majority of cases " they 
" have the ability to count at least as high as 
ten." This limit is often extended to twenty, 
and not infrequently to one hundred. Again 
we find one thousand as the limit, or perhaps 
ten thousand ; and sometimes the savage car- 
ries his number system on into the hundreds 
of thousands or the millions. 

The origin of some number words can be

made out, but many of the names for small 
numbers do not tell their own story. This is 
particularly true for the numeral words of 
higher peoples : those of lower tribes are often 
quite transparent. High numbers are quite com- 
monly expressed by words compounded of the 
names of lower terms. This compounding may 
begin far down, and even three and four may 
be expressed by compounds, such as two-one, 
one-two, two-two, or second-two. Compounds 
may be produced too either by addition, as in 
our own language, where forty-two means two 
and forty ; or by subtraction, as in Latin, where 
duodeviginti means twenty minus two. Where 
finger-counting prevailed, it is natural that five 
should be called by the word for hand, and that 
its multiples should show evidence of finger 
counting, or of finger-and-toe tallying. So in 
Arawak (Guiana) dialects, we find dbbatek- 
habe = one hand = five ; biamanteMbbe = two 
hands = ten ; and abba - lulcku = hands = feet = 
twenty. In Kiriri (South America) twenty is 
expressed as mikriba misa idecho ibi sm=both 
hands together with the feet. Twenty is often 
the word man, showing that the whole natural 
counting-board has been gone over. Often mul- 
tiples of twenty are consistently expressed as so 
many men. Thus, in Maipure (South America), 
they say papita camonee=one man = twenty ; 
forty is two men, sixty is three men, etc. Some- 
times numeral words are simple descriptions of 
the act done with the finger on which they fall 
in the counting ; sometimes they are the names 
of the fingers themselves. 

" Often some characteristic word, not of 
hand derivation, is found " as a numeral. In 
Yoruba (Africa) ogodzi = a string = forty, be- 
cause forty cowry shells made " a string " in 
trade ; Maori e&cm=bunch=ten, because yams 
and fish were sold in bunches of ten. The words 
for one and two are sometimes simply " this " and 
" that." A suggestion from nature often gives a 
numeral word ; things always occurring in pairs 
easily give " two." The Abipone, for four, 
says " toes of an ostrich "; for five he uses the 
name of a hide, which always presents a five- 
color pattern. After devoting two chapters to 
the origin of number words, Dr. Conant gives 
the following suggestive table : 

1 = existence, piece, group, beginning. 

2 = repetition, division, natural pair. 

3 = collection, many, two-one. 

4 = two-twos. 

5 = hand, group, division. 

6 = five-one, two-threes, second-one. 

7 = five-two, second-two, three from ten. 

8 = five -three, second-three, two from ten. 



9 = five-four, three-threes, one from ten. 
10 = one group, two hands, half-a-man, one-man. 
15 = ten-five, one-foot, three-fives. 
20 = two-tens, one-man, two-feet. 

To us, a decimal system seems so natural 
that we are likely to forget that other bases 
than ten for number systems may and do exist. 
A basis of some kind, a point in the count 
where we begin again with a higher order of 
numerals, is necessary if numbers are to be 
much developed. The number of bases either 
actually used or theoretically proposed for sys- 
tems is considerable. The great Leibnitz de- 
sired to introduce a system of numeration where 
only the two figures, 1 and 0, should be used. 
True binary systems are common enough, 
especially in Australia and South America. 
Where developed so highly as to run up to six, 
the words in such a system will be on the plan 
one, two, two-one, two-two, two-two-one, two- 
two-two. Ternary and quaternary scales are 
less common. The assertion has been made 
that systems based upon four were once com- 
mon in Central Asia ; very curious and com- 
plicated systems of the sort are found in Hawaii 
and the Marquesas Islands. Traces of a senary 
system are shown in our terms used in regard 
to dice ; and survivals of systems based on 
twelve and sixty duodecimal and sexigesimal 
systems are found in our selling by dozens 
and grosses, and in our time reckoning and 
circular measurement. From time to time a 
consistent return to twelve as a basis for a nu- 
meral system is urged by reformers among our- 
selves. But while systems based on two, three, 
four, six, eight, twelve, sixty may be found, and 
while they present much of interest, the com- 
mon systems of the world at large are the quin- 
ary, decimal, and vigesimal, based on five, 
ten, and twenty. This naturally results from 
finger-and-toe count. 

" Whether or not the principal number base of any 
tribe is to be twenty seems to depend entirely upon a 
single consideration: are the fingers alone used as an 
aid to counting, or are both fingers and toes used? If 
only the fingers are employed, the resulting scale must 
become decimal if sufficiently extended. If use is made 
of the toes in addition to the fingers, the outcome must 
inevitably be a vigesimal system. Subordinate to either 
one of these, the quinary may and often does appear. 
It is never the principal base in any extended system." 

" A pure quinary or vigesimal system is ex- 
ceedingly rare." The Betoya scale is perhaps 
as good an example as any of a quinary sys- 
tem : Five=hand ; ten=two hands ; fifteen=three 
hands ; twenty = four hands. No European na- 
tion uses a true quinary system. Scales where 
numbers up to ten are made on a quinary base

and then present a combination of quinary and 
decimal are common, and the author presents 
examples from many peoples of almost all con- 
tinents. Vigesimal scales are known in Europe 
and Africa. The French and Danish are cases 
in point. We ourselves talk of scores, and 
man's life is " three score years and ten." In 
Asia such systems are far more common. Many 
languages of the Caucasus present such. Those 
of the Tschukshi and the Ainu are nearly per- 
fect. Nowhere are there more perfect viges- 
imal systems, however, than in America. The 
languages of Mexico, Yucatan, and New Gran- 
ada present good specimens. " The scale is 
just as regular by twenties in Maya as by tens 
in English." Thus : 

20 =kal. 

20kal = bak = 400. 

20 bak = pic = 8000. 

20 pic = calab = 160000. 

20 calab = kincb.il = 3200000. 

20 kinchil = alau = 64000000. 

A brief review can give little idea of the 
interest of Dr. Conant's book. We have only 
indicated the treatment. The author's style is 
simple, lucid, attractive. Although in subject 
somewhat technical, in method scholarly, and 
with much tabular material, the book will in- 
terest even the ordinary reader. To mathe- 
matics it is an important contribution ; to eth- 
nography and culture history it is a mine of 
valuable information. FREDERICK STARR. 



THE NATURAL, AND THE SUPERNATURAL,.* 

Several of the books before us notably the first 
one bring us back to that question of questions 
which underlies our rational life, the relation of the 
natural and supernatural. The fact of such a rela- 
tion is the most patent and omnipresent in the his- 
tory of the human mind. Its final conception and 
statement elude us all. If we make the natural

complete and absolute, we not only rule out religion, 
we rule out rational life as well. If we give an 
uncritical form and ready admission to the super- 
natural, our faith takes on constantly a supersti- 
tious, irrational, and unproductive cast. To com- 
pletely maintain the laws of action implanted in our 
physical and our intellectual constitution, and yet 
to maintain in the world and in ourselves that true 
personal and spiritual power which alone makes 
these laws significant for us, is the summation of 
sound philosophy. 

" Old Faiths and New Facts," by Dr. W. W. 
Kinsley, is a book of marked ability. It considers 
the relation of these two elements of our lives 
the natural and the supernatural in connection 
with prayer, with the personality of Christ, and with 
immortality. It is addressed to the intelligent be- 
liever, with the purpose of making his belief at once 
more reposeful and more exhilarating. We should 
say of it that the lines of thought offered are sound 
rather than critical. The author feels more dis- 
criminatingly the reasons which make for his posi- 
tions than those present in comparatively few minds 
which make against them. He does not at least 
so it seems to us sufficiently curb the supernatural 
to bring it into the full service of reason. As that 
is the task which the bolder thinking of our time 
has undertaken, any failure to feel its need very 
much weakens even the soundest defence of this 
essential term of our spiritual life. The author 
finds himself committed apparently to every alleged 
miracle of the Bible, and so unduly burdened in the 
discussion. Our faith needs to be purged and puri- 
fied on the side of the supernatural, and widely 
strengthened and sustained on the side of the natu- 
ral, before it can be that rational power which 
spreads a world of noble activities before us, and 
fully kindles the inner courage essential for their 
enjoyment. There is much in the volume to be com- 
mended. 

Mr. Brownson's " Faith and Science " follows 
another vein running in the same direction. It is 
an effort toward the reconciliation of faith and sci- 
ence, religion and philosophy, by rendering the 
common grounds of all knowledge. This the author 
does with the zest of a metaphysician. He shows 
the confidence and strength of one who feels sure of 
the most general and permanent relations of truth. 
The book is refreshing, indicating as it does that 
not quite all have lost confidence in the mind itself, 
or confidence in the product of thought as accumu- 
lated by the past centuries. The race has not passed 
through a growth of vagaries, and then at length, 
with a sudden burst of power, planted its feet on 
firm ground. If there is any one thing for which 
we remain indebted to the Catholic faith, it is this 
hold on the past this tap-root of an historic sense 
of the continuity of the divine mind and methods. 
The counterpart of this truth, that the past must 
flow freely with ready change into the present and 
future, is not so well rendered. The philosophy of

the volume is penetrative, discursive, and historic, 
but is not likely to interest those who have drawn 
away from this form of thought. The intuitionalist, 
though he may find some difficulty with the exact 
way in which the power of the mind to seize and 
understand its own is presented, will certainly take 
pleasure in the fundamental idea. The author is 
appreciative of the contribution to knowledge of our 
time. 

" Though our men of science, both by precept and 
ex? tuple, have done their best to prove science impos- 
sible ai:<i to efface all radical distinction between man 
and the br^te, and really have proved that rationalism 
left to itself soon ceases to be rational, their labors have 
not been in vain, and by their unwearied industry they 
have amassed abundant and invaluable materials for the 
construction of the sciences which the philosopher has 
hitherto lacked " (pag^ 111). 

" The Expansion of Religion " a volume of 
Lowell Lectures is admirable in purpose and 
thoroughly well executed. The title clearly ex- 
presses the object of the author to indicate the 
growing ways in whicu a truly religious feeling is 
taking posession of the woild for its guidance and 
correction. This assertion of expansion is not true 
of any single dogmatic faith, but is preeminently 
true of that spiritual frame of mind which underlies 
all religious life. The book widens out its discus- 
sion in the direction of spiritual belief?, personal 
character, social structure, and organized religious 
action. Its temper is a wise, sober, progressive one, 
which we can heartily commend. The dominant 
thoughts of the lectures are : the prosperity of the 
individual as wrapped up in that of the community, 
and personal life as the power of religious truth. 
These are brought out everywhere with clearness 
and firmness. 

" Christ's Trumpet-Call to the Ministry," by Dr. 
D. S. Gregory, is a very full and forcible putting of 
the case as to the importance and authority of the 
ministry in proclaiming Christianity. " Direct and 
effective Gospel preaching " is with it " the imme- 
diate salvation of the world." The volume rests on 
the supernatural character of Christian faith. Natu- 
ral agents and methods receive but meagre recog- 
nition. Indeed, the hortatory temper in religion 
almost always implies supernatural terms of action, 
supernatural aids to such action, and divine re- 
sponses under it. The author and men of a kindred 
outlook, thoroughly as they may be in earnest in a 
renovating work, seem to forget that the best of 
preaching has issued in only qualified success ; that 
the obstacles to progress lie as deeply imbedded in 
Christendom as in heathendom, and that if we were 
to select any, the best body of believers, we should 
still find in them only the germs of the Kingdom of 
Heaven. The supernatural, separating itself from 
a wide discussion of the natural conditions and 
methods of growth in society, leaves society in a 
very inadequate, fitful, and uneven response to the 
duties which organize men in the Kingdom of 
Heaven. A preacher may say admirable things in 



an emphatic way, and still find his audience but 
partially responsive. The remedy is not found in 
a more stentorian tone. Dr. Gregory's presentation, 
though carefully wrought out, is weakened by this 
underlying assumption. 

" The Mind of the Master," by the Rev. John 
Watson (Ian Maclaren), is designed to draw pre- 
eminent attention to the words of Christ as the very 
substance of the Gospel message, and to put some- 
what in the background the teachings that accom- 
pany them and the dogmas that have arisen in con- 
nection with them. This is virtually a return toward 
the natural. If we meet Christ simply as a medium 
of truth, a higher form of life, we are at once at 
work under the laws of our own spiritual constitu- 
tion ; the natural and the supernatural, the deter- 
minate methods of growth and that insight and lib- 
erty which enable us to employ them, begin to flow 
together in a product of conduct and character, as 
firm as the physical and as free as the spiritual 
world. The volume is made up of a series of phases 
of truth associated with Christ, such as : " The Sov- 
ereignty of Character," " Devotion to a Person the 
Dynamic of Religion," " Optimism the Attitude of 
Faith." The work is done with fine insight, a subtle 
spiritual temper, and decided literary excellence. 
The volume is one to which the reader may return 
in many moods of mind, with much pleasure. 

The last two of the volumes on our present list 
are closely associated. The first of them, " The 
Religious Forces of the United States," by Dr. H. 
K. Carroll, is a very full and carefully analytic 
statement of the various forms of religious faith in 
the United States. Dr. Carroll had charge, in the 
eleventh census, of the statistics of churches. Not 
only are the general facts given, they are made 
clear and forceful by tracing their precise form and 
productive causes. " Classification of the Churches," 
" The Causes of Division," " The Distribution of 
the Several Forms of Faith," "The Evangelical 
and Non-Evangelical Elements," "The Negro in 
his Relations to the Church," are a portion of the 
explanatory topics. The work is a complete pre- 
sentation of the familiar but confused fact of the 
manifold forms of religious belief in the United 
States. 

The last volume, " Church Unity," is a plea in 
correction of a widespread and obvious evil. It is 
made up of five discourses delivered in Union Theo- 
logical Seminary, by as many members of leading 
churches, all of them representative men : Dr. 
Charles W. Shields, Dr. E. Benjamin Andrews, Dr. 
John F. Hurst, Dr. Henry C. Potter, Dr. Armory 
H. Bradford. The preface lays emphasis on the 
" concord of opinion " between these divines, each 
pursuing his own line of thought. 

The division of the natural and the supernatural 
is involved in this topic, as in the previous ones. 
Only on the supposition of an adequate and author- 
itative dogma given by revelation can we expect to 
return to church unity in connection with a creed.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



We should deem it preposterous to push for unity 
in matters of science or philosophy, by accepting as 
ultimate certain primary principles. The intellect 
is necessarily analytic and divisive in its action. 
Whatever unity is possible to it can only be reached 
by pushing onward in endless activity through and 
beyond the more partial and more variable aspects 
of truth. Activity means, and must always mean, 
diversity. This diversity is natural, is inevitable, is 
desirable ; it lies in the breadth of the topic and the 
diffusion of thought. The unity of the churches 
under natural law is not the unity of a creed, but 
the unity of an end pursued by all paths, through 
all creeds, and with the aid of every rite. The 
Kingdom of Heaven cannot be anticipated by a 
formal construction. It must have the diversity and 
vitality in every part of it of a free living organism. 

In spite of the preface, the " concord of opinion " 
is not apparent in these lectures, or in their several 
parts. The undeniable fact, the need of unity among 
Christians, and the very disputable idea that the 
Chicago Lambeth articles are an open means to this 
end, are not reconciled in the discussions. Unity, 
growing out of concurrent action for the coming of 
the Kingdom, is one thing ; and a formal unity, less 
or greater, under the articles of a creed, is another 
and very different thing. The relation of the two 
is not thoroughly elucidated. Some of the lectures 
have the one chiefly in view, and some the other. 
The two things seem to us incapable of being united. 
The one form of unity relegates the creed to a 
secondary position ; the other conspicuously retains 
it as a primary factor. The presentation of Dr. 
Shields is not easily harmonized with that of Dr. 
Bradford, while the intermediate lecturers are not 
careful to reconcile the two fundamental methods. 
The several lectures of which the volume is com- 
posed are of the best. Against the spirit of the 
discussion we have not a word to say. Our only 
difficulty with it lies in the feeling that the result 
implicitly involved in it must be perfectly formal. 
So far as it should prove efficacious, it would be 
likely also to prove hurtful by deadening that ac- 
tivity of thought which is, after all, genetic in the 
Kingdom of Heaven. 

These discourses, however, have much of that 
temper which subordinates belief to action, and 
here we most heartily agree with them. The unity 
which is coming to the Church must be found by 
picking up its hopes, and casting them, with one 
mighty fling, forward into the Kingdom of Heaven.

The reader of M. Zola's " Rome " struggles 
through the volumes with a sense of bewilderment, 
and closes them with a somewhat reluctant recog- 
nition of their power. It is evident that the author 
has gathered his material hastily together, and that 
the process of elaboration has been far from com- 
plete. In this respect, the Roman novels of Mr. 
Crawford are more finished productions, and afford 
us glimpses of the social and ecclesiastical life of the 
capital of Christendom that could not possibly have 
been revealed to M. Zola in the few weeks that he 
gave himself for investigation on the spot. But the 
scope of the French novelist's work is so vast, his

considerable, that the " Saracinesca " books are in 
most respects easily distanced. One finds in " Rome " 
the evidence of wide reading, supplemented by 
enough direct observation to give vitality to the 
narrative. A guide-book to the topography, ancient 
and modern, of the city, a summary of its history 
and its art, a study of its economic and social con- 
ditions, and, above all else, a searching analysis of 
the Church in its latter-day workings and signifi- 
cance, are all embraced in M. Zola's magnificent 
scheme. To these features the private and personal 
interest of the characters are strictly subordinated ; 
the story of ecclesiastical intrigue and wire-pulling 
has the first place, and the tragic love-story is of 
only subsidiary importance. The chief figure is that 
of the Abbe" Froment, whom we learned to know in 
" Lourdes." Shaken in his faith and utterly dis- 
heartened by contact with the display of gross super- 
stition witnessed at the Grotto, he returns to Paris 
in search of a new religious ideal. This he soon 
finds in a somewhat nebulous sort of Christian so- 
cialism, and he pictures to himself a regenerated 
Church in harmony with the teachings and practice 
of primitive Christianity. His ideal presently pro- 
jects itself into a book, " Rome Nouvelle," which 
embodies all the ardent aspiration of his youthful 
and deeply religious soul. But the book finds slight 
favor with the Church, and he learns, to his dismay, 
that it is about to be placed in the Index. He 
hastens to Rome to plead his cause, and the whole 
novel is the story of his efforts to gain a hearing. 
As the weeks lengthen into months, while he is put 
off on one pretext after another, and sent from dig- 
nitary to dignitary in his quest, his spirits fail him, 
and a sort of moral disintegration sets in, which is 
furthered by his ever-deepening sense of the con- 
trast between the ideal Church of which he has 
dreamed and the real Church which he gradually 
comes to know in its chief stronghold and in the per- 
sons of its chief representatives. The situation is 
that of a nineteenth-century Luther, but a Luther 
who in the end submits, as far as the externals go, and 
reprobates his own work. We leave him seemingly 
crushed by the machinery that has been brought to 
bear upon his will, yet not without signs of an 
inward spring that is likely in the future to shape 
his life to a deeper and more lasting revolt than the 
one now in appearance subdued. M. Zola has often 
shown himself a master of irony, but never before 
so triumphantly as in the scene of the long-sought 
audience with the Holy Father, when the priest 
makes his submission, seemingly persuaded of the 
error of his ways, but in reality more deeply than 
ever before in antagonism with the Church. As he 
utters the formula of self-reprobation, there is shap- 
ing itself deep in his heart the feeling that his 
dream of a regenerated Church was indeed an idle 
one, that the old vessel would crack were the new 
wine poured into it. " Rome " is a book calculated 
to cause much controversy. Its weight seems, on 
the whole, to be thrown against the Church ; yet the 
argument for the Church is stated with great force, 



and the author, although he must be taken as the 
champion of positivism, has enough of the historic 
sense to write a book as widely as possible separated 
from anti-religious polemics of the shallow Vol- 
tairean type. The author has set himself as a task 
to see the whole of his subject, and to see it as 
steadily as possible ; when we consider what that 
subject is, it may fairly be said that he has achieved 
a reasonable degree of success. It should be added 
that there is little of what we commonly think of as 
" Zolaism " in the book ; with the exception of a 
single scene that, in spite of its power, good taste 
must condemn, there is nothing to give serious 
offense. The book is a far finer production than 
" Lourdes," for which fact the subject-matter is not 
alone responsible. 

We see the French Revolution from a new point 
of view in " The Reds of the Midi," a novel trans- 
lated from the Provencal of M. Felix Gras by Mrs. 
Janvier. M. Gras tells the story of the famous 
Marseilles battalion that marched to Paris with its 
new war-song, filled the hearts of the revolutionists 
with fresh courage, and took part in the attack on 
the Tuileries on the Tenth of August. The story is 
placed upon the lips of a peasant, a participant in 
the march, who in his old age relates it to a circle 
of eager listeners. History has treated these Mar- 
seilles patriots very unfairly, representing them as 
cutthroats and escaped galeriens. It has been a 
leading motive with the author to rehabilitate their 
fame, and recent historical investigations justify his 
partisanship. M. Gras himself is an exceedingly 
interesting character, and no part of the book is 
more readable than the biographical introduction 
contributed by Mr. Janvier. He tells us that M. 
Gras was born a little over half a century ago, that 
he attempted law and abandoned it for literature, 
that he became associated with the Felibrige, and 
is now its capouliS, or head, the successor of Rou- 
manille, who succeeded Mistral. He has published 
epic and other poems, and stories of old-time Avig- 
non, and has written (but not yet published in the 
original Provencal) the romance now translated, 
which is thus given to the world for the first time 
in English dress. It is a noteworthy piece of story- 
telling, and Mrs. Janvier's English is so good as to 
make it difficult to believe the work to be other than 
an original. 

One of the most remarkable French novelists now 
living, M. Edouard Rod, is introduced to the Amer- 
ican public by " The White Rocks," a translation 
of one of his most charming stories. M. Rod is a 
Swiss writer, which brings him into comparison with 
the veteran novelist, M. Cherbuliez ; and his work 
will bear the comparison fairly well, for it is deeper 
and more convincing, although less animated and 
inventive. M. Rod's closest affinity is, however, 
with M. Paul Bourget, for both have the same psy- 
chological method, the same critical faculty, and the 
same seriousness of purpose. " The White Rocks " 
is a study of Swiss provincial life, and its leading 
figure is a young Protestant pastor, whose peasant

origin makes it impossible for him fully to acquire 
the manner of men delicately bred, but whose essen- 
tial nobility of character wins the admiration of 
those who look beneath the surface of a man's per- 
sonality. Temptation comes to him in the shape 
familiar to French novels, but he conquers it man- 
fully, although the act of renunciation costs him the 
bitterest struggle of his life, and his horizon at the 
close of the book is left well nigh cheerless. As a 
study of the pettiness of provincial manners and 
ideals the book is full of subtle touches, and will 
repay a close examination. Even the lesser char- 
acters, of whom there are many, are distinctly indi- 
vidualized, and their delineation bears all the im- 
press of truth. 

With the three translations from the French just 
passed in review, we may discuss three rather im- 
portant translations from the recent fiction of the 
Scandinavian North ; and it is something of a co- 
incidence that the first of the three to be taken up, 
Herr Pontoppidan's " Emanuel ; or, Children of the 
Soil," should be like M. Rod's novel in dealing with 
the experiences of a young and diffident pastor in 
a small provincial parish. Herr Pontoppidan's 
" Emanuel " is the first part of a sort of novel- 
trilogy, in which the author has sought to exhibit 
the after-effects of the Grundtvigian movement that 
stirred Danish society to its foundations in the fifties 
and sixties. It is to be hoped that " The Promised 
Land " and " The Day of Judgment," the two re- 
maining sections of the trilogy, will also soon be 
put into English. The movement which will always 
be known by the name of Bishop Grundtvig was a 
religious revival and something more. It aimed to 
substitute a living Christianity for the dull formal- 
ism that had taken hold of the church in Denmark, 
and at the same time to awaken the historical con- 
sciousness of the Scandinavian people by reviving 
an interest in their magnificent inheritance of myth 
and tradition. It also aimed to exalt the peasant as 
the finest, because the least sophisticated, element of 
the Scandinavian character. We say Scandinavian 
rather than Danish of set purpose, because Grundt- 
vig's influence was felt throughout the three countries, 
and because he never ceased to urge their union. The 
novel now under discussion deals with the seventies, 
when Grundtvig was no more, although his spirit 
was still abroad and pictures for us the life of a 
small peasant community hopelessly estranged from 
the State Church, yet eager for spiritual guidance. 
The generous soul of the pastor soon brings him into 
sympathy with the aspirations of his people ; he 
marries a girl of peasant extraction, and breaks with 
his ecclesiastical superior. At the last moment, the 
intervention of Bishop Monrad, who is wise enough 
to see and correctly interpret the signs of the times, 
persuades the hero to remain in the Church, leaving 
him free to work out his ideals under the protection 
of the organization. This hasty outline can give 
but an imperfect notion of what the reader will find 
to be a very genuine and charming book, fresh in 
its interest and valuable as a means of acquaintance 



with the intimate life of one of the most interesting 
of European peoples. 

One is a little puzzled to learn from the title-page 
of "Camilla" that the novel is translated "from 
the Swedish and Danish of Richert von Koch." A 
prefatory note explains the mystery, however, tell- 
ing us that the original is Swedish, but that the 
heroine, a Danish young woman on a visit to Stock- 
holm, speaks in her own tongue throughout the book. 
"At first," says the author, " I let her talk Swedish, 
but she was thereby changed into a wholly different 
person. Such mighty influence has language not 
only over thought, but also over the whole person- 
ality." The novel is a pretty sort of love-story, 
with a strong pietistic flavor which keeps it from 
being very good art. There are many pages of 
rather puerile religious discussion, and even the 
Salvation Army is taken seriously. The name of 
the translator is not given, but the initials N. H. D., 
affixed both to the preface and the occasional notes, 
warrant us in making a good guess. 

We are not informed in what language "Vera 
Vorontzoff " was originally written, but we assume 
it to have been the Swedish, since the translation is 
made by a lady of that nationality. The book is a 
straightforward intense narrative of the revolution- 
ary propaganda in Russia, sketching for us the sit- 
uation that is presented in far greater elaboration 
by Tourgue'nieff's " Virgin Soil," and written with 
marked sympathy and sincerity of purpose. There 
can be little doubt that Madame Kovalevsky put a 
good deal of her own life into these pages, with 
such marvellous skill has she interpreted the emo- 
tions and the high-strung aspirations of the young 
girl who is the heroine. In many ways this story 
of a fictitious heroine is the story of the famous 
mathematician's own girlhood, as she embodied it 
in the wonderfully vivid autobiographical fragment 
published a year or two ago. We do not find here 
the art of the novelist so much as the frank self- 
revelation of the woman of genius who cannot 
escape, nor wishes to, from the trammels of her sub- 
jectivity. We may smile at the ill-balanced enthu- 
siasm that impels the heroine of this tale to self- 
immolation in her chosen cause, but we cannot 
escape the impression that this is one of the most 
genuine books ever written, or refrain from paying 
tribute to the high qualities of mind and heart that 
it reveals. Some of the pages, particularly those 
relating to the Emancipation, are worthy of Tour- 
gue'nieff himself, which is about the highest praise 
that it is possible to bestow. 

In " The Master Craftsman," Sir Walter Besant 
has given us an unusually good story, one that sus- 
tains its interest to the last and leaves a pleasant 
impression upon the memory. Two young men, 
distantly related, and reared under entirely different 
circumstances, are the chief characters. One is a 
man of leisure and of the world, suddenly confronted 
with the problem of earning a living ; the other is 
a master boat-builder who plies his craft at Wap- 
ping where the Old Stairs were. The latter wants

to get into Parliament, while the former has no 
ambitions in that direction. To put the matter 
briefly, they agree to change places, each instruct- 
ing the other in the ways of the world which he 
desires to enter. So the man of society becomes a 
boat-builder, and the boat-builder learns how to 
conduct himself in polite circles, achieves his polit- 
ical ambitions, and becomes a power in the State. 
Incidentally, each of the men marries the woman 
whom nature seems to have destined for the other. 
The book has also a hidden treasure that comes to 
light just when it should, and a great deal of curi- 
ous information about Wapping and the older part 
of London generally. It has the breeziness, the 
wholesome quality, and the entertaining improb- 
ability of all Sir Walter's work, and needs no better 
commendation. 

By " A First Fleet Family " we are to understand 
a family included in the first shipment of convicts 
and their guard to Botany Bay in New South Wales. 
The authors of the book (for it is a collaborative 
work) have given us quite as much fact as fiction, and 
told perhaps for the first time in readable literary 
form the story of the famous penal settlement in its 
beginnings. The element of historical justification 
enters quite considerably into this book, which may, 
nevertheless, be read for entertainment alone with- 
out any great disappointment, although judged as a 
work of fiction pure and simple it has many short- 
comings. 

If we are not greatly mistaken, Mr. S. R. Keight- 
ley is a new novelist who will have to be reckoned 
with. His two works, " The Crimson Sign " and 
" The Cavaliers," are as good historical fiction as 
has been published in many a day, quite as good as 
the early books of Mr. Weyman and Dr. Doyle. 
Of course, they are the same sort of thing over 
again, just as " Micah Clarke " and " A Gentleman 
of France " were Scott and Dumas over again, and 
equally of course, the man whose genius originates 
a style and a manner stands on a pedestal far above 
the heads of the men who merely imitate him. This 
reservation being made, we may give very high 
praise to Mr. Keightley's novels. " The Crimson 
Sign," which is the less finished and effective of the 
two, deals with the famous siege of Londonderry ; 
" The Cavaliers " has for its subject the Civil War 
in England, the victories of Cromwell, and the trials 
of the King at Oxford and Carisbrooke Castle. In 
the latter book, as the title would indicate, our sym- 
pathies are enlisted in the royalist cause, although 
justice is not withheld from Cromwell in the strik- 
ing portrayal of his character that the tale affords. 

E. Livingston Frescott is a new name to us, and 
appears at about the same time upon the title-pages 
of two novels. Both stories are of the most improb- 
able sort, so irresponsible in their dealings with 
human character that they hold the attention only 
by their appeal to curiosity. We wonder at every 
step what fantastic twist of invention will be the 
next to be displayed by the writer. In "The 
Apotheosis of Mr. Tyrawley " we have for hero a 



card-sharper and chevalier d'industrie, who falls 
sentimentally in love with a schoolgirl, and deter- 
mines to lead " a better life." He has a hard time 
of it, but comes out all right at last, and finds a 
benevolent old uncle added to the other rewards of 
virtue. In "A Mask and a Martyr " we have for 
hero a man who seems to be a coward, a drunkard, 
and a thief. After we have tried to become rec- 
onciled to the various forms of blackguardism to 
which he appears addicted, we find out to our 
amazement that he has only pretended to be a 
scoundrel, that his wife is a dipsomaniac, and that 
he has thus shaped appearances against his own 
character for the sole purpose of shielding her, and 
avoiding the exposure of her infirmity. Both of 
these books do violence to every principle of good 
novel-writing, and their ingenuity of invention does 
little to save them from condemnation. 

Mr. Max Pemberton, after essaying several other 
varieties of fiction with more or less success, has 
made an experiment in the picaresque, choosing, 
however, to set his rascally hero in a nineteenth- 
century environment, instead of removing him to 
the comfortable distance of the seventeenth century. 
Piquancy is certainly lent to the story by the con- 
trast thus offered between the modern setting, on 
the one hand, and the old-fashioned sort of motive, 
intrigue, and literary manner, on the other. The 
story is told by a valet the " Gentleman's Gentle- 
man " of the title and a precious rascal he makes 
his master out to be. True to the picaresque model, 
the tale has but slight unity as a whole, and relies 
for its interest upon the episodes that it loosely links 
together. 

u The Second Opportunity of Mr. Staplehurst " 
is a whimsical narrative of the sort that we associate 
with the writer who calls himself F. Anstey. A 
successful man of letters, who has reached middle 
life, expresses the wish to begin his career over again, 
retaining the benefit of his already acquired expe- 
rience. Greatly to his surprise the wish is granted, 
and he finds his youth renewed, although he still 
remembers all about his former existence. But he 
uses his " second opportunity " only to make a mess 
of things, and ends by wishing himself back into 
his previous life. The story is extremely amusing, 
although the conception is worked out in a rather 
reckless way, and a good many tag-ends are left for 
the imagination of the reader to adjust. 

" The X Jewel " is an interesting romance, dis- 
appointing only because it is left in an unfinished 
state. This was doubtless intentional with the 
writer, but we really have a right to know more 
than he tells us of the mystery concerned, and to 
enjoy at greater length the reunion of the happy 
lovers. The story deals with the turbulent Scotch 
court during the early manhood of the son of Mary 
Stuart, and affords us the novelty of reading about 
Elizabeth in the character of an " old termagant." 
The delineation of James would be masterly if it 
did not clothe him as a boy with all the shrewdness 
and pedantry of his later years. It is impossible to

accept this sketch of the King in 1585, although it 
would pass without question twenty or thirty years 
later. The tale is compactly told, and almost Stev- 
ensonian in the finish of its best pages. 

The anonymous novel called " A Stumhler in 
Wide Shoes " deserves a better title. It is the very 
readable story of a young Dutch artist who marries 
an English girl, does not appreciate her simple 
devotion and strength of character, becomes en- 
tangled with a beautiful Jewess, gets into desperate 
financial straits, and in trying to extricate himself 
becomes a thief. His character is so utterly worth- 
less that we are hardly prepared for his final apoth- 
eosis. When he has realized the depth of his hu- 
miliation, he goes to Paris, starts a new life under 
an assumed name, becomes a great artist, and re- 
ceives forgiveness from bis injured wife. It is true 
that he was not only sinning, but sinned against as 
well, yet the rehabilitation of his character seems 
to be beyond the limits of the possible. The scene 
of the story is laid, for the most part, in Amster- 
dam, and one gets a vivid and faithful reproduction 
of the life of that interesting city. 

Mr. Henry Seton Merriman is a novelist of grow- 
ing power, and the two books recently published 
by him exhibit a distinct advance over his earlier 
work. One of them, " The Sowers," is essentially 
a study of the Russian revolutionary propaganda 
in its phase of pacific philanthropical endeavor. 
There is an interesting plot, carefully constructed, 
a great deal of crisp and effective dialogue, and 
a fine ideal of human conduct. The characters 
are well differentiated, and each of the more im- 
portant figures is a study by itself. "Flotsam" 
shifts the scene from Russia to India, and its inter- 
est centres about the Mutiny, although but one im- 
portant episode of that struggle the siege of Delhi 
is described at length. The leading character is 
a man in many ways prepossessing, but fatally weak, 
and led by his lack of will to the disaster that wrecks 
his life. It is evident that Mr. Merriman has writ- 
ten neither of these books from hearsay, but has 
visited the countries concerned, and made faithful 
studies of the local coloring. The conscience thus 
displayed, together with a brilliant gift for charac- 
terization and dramatic effect, put his novels among 
the best of the season for entertainment, and, to no 
small extent, for instruction. 

Mrs. Cotes, also, has an Indian story for us in 
"His Honour, and a Lady." It deals with the 
social life of modern India, which the writer knows 
well, but displays, besides, no little insight into the 
native character. It cannot be compared in this 
respect with the work of Mr. Kipling and Mrs. 
Steel, but their example has made it henceforth 
impossible for a novelist of India to give us the 
merely conventionalized background of native life 
as we used to have it in Anglo-Indian fiction. Our 
eyes have been opened, and even so superficial a 
writer as Mrs. Cotes is forced to furnish something 
better than the old pretence of characterization. 
The story is essentially that of an earnest and incor- 



ruptible, but unimaginative and philistine, English 
official, who tries to do his duty in his own stubborn 
way. We cannot sympathize very much with the 
particular thing he tries to do, and which in the end 
leads to his overthrow and death, but we can heartily 
applaud the spirit in which he sets about what he 
conceives to be his duty. Mrs. Cotes, like most 
other people who have lived for any length of time 
in India, understands very clearly how ill-advised 
is much of the meddlesome legislation for the Em- 
pire that emanates from Westminster, and how nec- 
essary it is that the colonial administrator should 
have a free hand in matters that do not affect for- 
eign relations. This phase of the subject receives 
sharp and effective satire at her hands. For the 
rest, her story is lively and agreeable, and of the 
sort that is as easily read as forgotten. 

In " The Madonna of a Day " we hardly recog- 
nize Miss DougalPs hand until we have got well 
into the book. It begins in so animated a fashion, 
and holds out such promise of real excitement, that 
the author seems to have taken a wholly new de- 
parture. The dull and heavy earnestness to which 
readers of her other books have become so accus- 
tomed appears after a while, but not before the 
story, as a mere piece of picturesque adventure, has 
acquired momentum sufficient to carry its interest 
on to the end. Miss Dougall's work is always orig- 
inal, and the present story is peculiarly so. We are 
tempted to call it the best that she has yet written. 

Miss Wilkins gives us in her new story some- 
thing more of passion and the play of the primitive 
instincts of humanity than she has been wont to deal 
with, and the result, it must be admitted, is art 
of a less finished and convincing sort than that 
to which her books have hitherto accustomed us. 
The figure of Madelon (who gives her name to the 
novel) is a little unreal and theatrical, and the 
other leading figures are even more difficult to live 
with as actual human beings. It is in its minor de- 
scriptions and delineations that the book is most 
successful, for it is in them that the writer is per- 
mitted to exhibit the delicacy of touch that has 
given her so distinguished a place in our fiction. 
The style of the book, in the non-dramatic portions, 
is admirable for restraint and poetic feeling, and in 
part compensates the reader for what he feels to be 
the defects of the novel in its vital aspect. 

Miss Bell's third novel, "The Under Side of 
Things," is an improvement on her second, but we 
should hesitate to describe it as better than her first. 
Viewed as a whole, it offers a pleasant picture of 
life in an Eastern country town, with glimpses of 
West Point and one or two army posts. The 
characters are agreeably diversified, and two of 
them Mrs. Copeland and Kate Vandevoort are 
triumphs of delineation. It is, however, in its care- 
ful working out of details that the book scores its 
chief success, and one has not read many pages be- 
fore he comes distinctly to understand that this is 
not a book to be skimmed over, that every line of 
it has been studied and will repay perusal. This

evidence of the artistic conscience is very gratifying 
in our age of hasty novel-writing, and special atten- 
tion should be called to it. There are many " smart " 
sayings in the book, but the mere cleverness which 
it might derive from them alone is overshadowed 
by the delicate and tender sentiment that informs 
the story throughout, and provides its chief charm. 
Once or twice, indeed, this sentiment comes dan- 
gerously near to being " gush," and we fear lest 
the limit should be overstepped. But the good sense 
of the writer stands her in stead at these critical 
junctures, and the situation is saved. No one but 
a woman could possibly have written this book or 
any page of it; the feminine touch is everywhere 
manifest, with its many pleasant implications, and, 
we must add, its inevitable limitations. 

One starts to read " A Fool of Nature " with 
some misgivings, for it was awarded the first prize 
in a newspaper competition, and the realization 
proves worse than the anticipation. If this story 
was the best of the hundreds entered, what must the 
others have been ? The pity of it is that Mr. Haw- 
thorne, who, although a third-rate novelist, is capa- 
ble of far better work than this, should have so 
deliberately written down to the level of the intelli- 
gence that he surmised would be brought to bear 
upon the awarding of the prizes. From first to last 
the book is unreal and unconvincing, written in a 
sort of slapdash journalese, and without any other 
adornment than the " smartness " of self-conscious- 
ness and the glitter of a tinsel rhetoric. 

Chicago is the scene of " Jerry the Dreamer," and 
the story is from the pen of a new writer. It tells 
of a young man who leaves his home in central 
Illinois to seek his fortunes in the great city, of his 
trials and successes, and of the weakness of char- 
acter that proves nearly, if not quite, fatal to his 
ambition. The author leaves us in some perplexity 
as to the future of his hero, with the impression of 
having got him into a fix and not knowing how to 
get him out again. The book shows many marks 
of inexperience, but is made attractive by a certain 
freshness and genuineness of treatment, together 
with a direct simplicity that is distinctly engaging. 
The heroine is a very commonplace sort of girl, and 
may hardly be given the sympathy that the writer 
evidently expects for her. But the book is, on the 
whole, a promising first effort, and we shall hope 
to find its author's name upon another title-page 

before very long.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Clearly, one of the greatest economic 
!. questions of the day is that which 

involves the governmental control or 
supervision state or national, or both of the rail- 
roads of this country. The vast and recent growth 
of the material, and especially of the agricultural, 
interests of the United States makes the question 
'of internal transportation one that vitally concerns 
a very large majority of the people, and an ade- 
quate solution of the problem a matter of the very 
first importance. The railroad problem of to-day 
is not the one that existed in the earlier history of 
our government. The conditions which then ex- 
isted did not require extensive internal communica- 
tions, nor was there much demand for assistance 
from the public or the government. A study of this 
vital question, in some of its essentially modern fea- 
tures, is presented by Professor F. H. Dixon, in his 
treatise on "State Railroad Control" (Crowell). 
He chooses to give a history of this control as illus- 
trated in the experience of Iowa, because that state 
was the centre of the Granger movement, the move- 
ment by which the questions of railroad manage- 
ment were most bitterly fought out and settled ; and 
also because Iowa's experience includes nearly every 
phase of the question of railroad control, and the 
Iowa Commission has been one of the best managed 
and most successful in the country. While the law 
of 1888 gave the Commission the right to prevent 
and punish extortion and unjust discrimination in 
the rates charged for transportation of passengers 
and freights on the railroads of Iowa, it had no 
jurisdiction over a large portion of the railroad busi- 
ness on account of its inter-state character. The 
author concludes that, " For adequate control of the 
inter-state business, we must look to Congress ; and 
the solution of this entire question of control must 
come through a combination of national and state 
control, and a judicious division of powers. . . . 
The state commission should have authority to inves- 
tigate local complaints of unjust discrimination, with 
the right to certify to the courts refusals to obey their 
orders. . . . To the national commission should be 
given full power of prescribing a general classifica- 
tion and a schedule of maximum rates for inter-state 
business. If such a schedule were enforced, and the 
rates made stable, there could be no inducement to 
discrimination and rate-cutting within a state, and 
the local rates could be left to the railroads." Pro- 
fessor Henry C. Adams, who writes the introduction 
to this book, gives a graphic historical description 
of the relation of the Government to inland trans- 
portation, and among other things, says: "The 
industry of transportation is fundamental in the 
industrial organization of a community. He who 
controls the means of communication has it in his 
power to arbitrarily make or destroy the business 
of any place or any person ; and it was because the 
public recognized this great power, which from its 
nature is dangerous when employed with a view to

the questions with which it ably deals. 

international It; was seemingly a piece of good 
relations and fortune that the three essays and 
arbitration. addresses collected under the title 

" America and Europe," and added to the series of 
volumes on "Questions of the Day" (Putnam), 
should appear almost simultaneously with the pub- 
lication of the recent correspondence between Sec- 
retary Olney and Lord Salisbury on the Venezuela 
boundary dispute and the problem of international 
arbitration. And yet, the attention of the American 
people is too closely fixed upon the opening skir- 
mishes of a momentous presidential battle to more 
than glance at the weighty utterances of even men 
like Mr. David A. Wells, Mr. Edward J. Phelps, 
and Mr. Carl Schurz, upon political questions which, 
though vitally important, have no light to throw on 
" 16 to 1." Mr. Wells, in the first paper, attempts 
to dissipate the prejudice in many American minds 
against the British method of building empire. Mr. 
Phelps discusses the Monroe Doctrine in relation to 
the Venezuela difficulty. He finds even less justifi- 
cation for the intervention of the United States than 
Lord Salisbury in his later correspondence appears 
to concede. He says : " Till some man can stand 
forth and inform us how we are to be injured by 
the adjustment of that Venezuela boundary line, I 
shall venture respectfully to assert that it is a con- 
troversy we have no right to meddle with." The 
third paper is upon Arbitration in International 
Disputes. After celebrating the praises of arbitra- 
tion, Mr. Schurz acknowledges there may be ques- 
tions of national honor which cannot be submitted 
to any tribunal, but he thinks that " It is time for 
modern civilization to leave behind it those mediae- 
val notions according to which personal honor found 
its best protection in the duelling pistol, and national 
honor could be vindicated only by slaughter and de- 
vastation." He does not attempt to discuss the prac- 
tical questions concerning the wisest composition of 
an international court of arbitration. These, how- 
ever, need more attention just now than the princi- 
ple of arbitration itself, if the present negotiations 
are to be pushed to a successful conclusion. 



More Jewish 
literature. 



"Studies in Judaism" (Macmillan) 
is the collective title of a series of 
papers, by Professor S. Schechter, 
Reader in Talmudic in the University of Cambridge, 
reprinted in a revised form from " The Jewish 
Quarterly " and " The Jewish Chronicle." The 
essays, while possessing a certain generic unity, are 
rather diversified in theme a distinct unity of 
purpose being traceable only in the three opening 
ones, on Chassidim, Krochmal, and the Gaon, which 
were written with a view of bringing under the notice 
of the English public a type of men evolved by the 



Synagogue of the Eastern Jews. That Synagogue 
is, the author observes, widely different from the 
more practical, and certainly more presentable, 
Synagogue of the West. " Its places of worship 
have no claims to ' beauty of holiness,' being in their 
outward appearance rather bare and bald, if not 
repulsive ; whilst those who frequent them are a 
noisy, excitable people, who actually dance on the 
' Season of Rejoicing ' and cry bitterly on the ' Days 
of Mourning.' But among all these vagaries or 
perhaps because of them this Synagogue has had 
its moments of grace, when enthusiasm wedded to 
inspiration gave birth to such beautiful souls as 
Baalshem, such fine skeptics as Krochmal, and such 
saintly scholars as Elijah Wilna." Other notable 
essays are : " A Jewish Boswell," " The Dogmas of 
Judaism," "The History of Jewish Tradition," 
" The Law and Recent Criticism," " The Child in 
Jewish Literature," "Woman in Temple and Syna- 
gogue," etc. The papers are marked throughout 
by scholarship, and should fulfil the purpose of their 
more serious side to attract the attention of stu- 
dents to the neglected and potentially fruitful field 
of Jewish mysticism and Rabbinic theology. 

j^ish women Miss Louise Mannheimer's scholarly 
in ancient and translation of Nahida Remy's search- 
modem times. m g an( j at ti me8 eloquent study of 
" The Jewish Woman " (C. J. Krehbiel & Co., Cin- 
cinnati) merits the attention of those interested in 
the general theme a phase of which it discusses. 
The work represents an effort made by a thoughtful 
Christian woman to present a true, though broadly- 
treated, picture of the idiosyncrasies of the Jewish 
woman. The work is not, like most of its class, a 
polemic for or against, the author seeking mainly 
broad and essential truth of portraiture, and with- 
holding neither praise nor censure where either is 
due. As Dr. Lazarus observes in his preface : " Her 
judgment of Jewish woman is candid and without 
bias, and if her growing admiration finds its climax 
in contemplation of their virtues in the olden times, 
her keen criticism is aroused by the observation of 
their failings in our own period." We cordially 
echo Dr. Lazarus's wish that Mme. Remy's book 
" will be largely read by Jewish women," who will 
not fail to find therein a high incentive to self- 
culture and elevation. The volume contains a por- 
trait of the author. 



Local rales 
in England. 



Mr. Edwin Cannan's work on " The 
History of Local Rates in England " 
(Longmans) consists of five lectures 
dealing with a phase of local taxation in England 
which is alike new and instructive. The author sub- 
mits a vast amount of historical data and dry detail. 
Yet, in the very first page of the book he admirably 
prepares us for the investigations which follow. He 
says : " A great deal that is true is not worth know- 
ing. The most inveterate bore is often the most 
truthful of men. All history should, I think, have 
some practical aim. Some moral, some lesson or

guidance, should be afforded by it. Even if tbis is 
not true of all history, it is surely true with regard 
to economic history. It would be absurd to study a 
subject so dry, not to say so odious, as local rates, 
except with a view to practical aims. We do not 
study such subjects from a love of truth in the ab- 
stract . . . but because there are practical contro- 
versies about them, and we hope that we may learn 
something which may be of assistance in these con- 
troversies." It is the purpose of this work to mass 
the facts explaining the origin and progress of the 
two great characteristics of the rating system which 
give rise to most complaint, namely, that rates are 
paid only in respect of certain kinds of property, and 
levied from the occupiers and not the owners of that 
property. The author has made extended research 
into the English statutes and the decisions bearing 
upon the questions with which he treats, and has 
added a deal of unique information upon a compar- 
atively obscure subject. 

Types and symbol* Professor E. P. Evans has found in 
in Mediaeval "Animal Symbolism in Ecclesiastical 

Architecture " (Holt) the subject for 
a very interesting book, and a very amusing one 
too, despite the somewhat scholastic character of its 
title. It is an attempt (p. 16) to indicate the origin 
and signification of the most prominent types and 
symbols in the curious and apocryphal natural his- 
tory of mediaeval Christianity, which comes to its 
most obvious presentation in ecclesiastical architec- 
ture. The standpoint of architecture was happily 
chosen, for we may see examples of animal sym- 
bolism in any mediaeval building we look at, either 
actually or in illustration ; whereas other manifes- 
tations of the tendency are, as a rule, to be observed 
only by the student. The subject is wide and often 
obscure, and Professor Evans would not assert that 
he has said the last word upon it. The book, how- 
ever, has an immense amount of example and illus- 
tration which will be useful to the scholar, while it 
is a perfect mine of entertainment to the more cur- 
sory reader. We cannot begin to give an idea of 
the variety of quaint interpretation and singular 
allegory to be found in the work. It is an extremely 
entertaining volume, besides being valuable, and will 
doubtless open to many entirely new sources of 
interest. 



Essays on the 
Sonnet and 
other things. 



If temperance in judgment, pliancy 
of style, and a knack of fresh and 
sympathetic presentation, are rea- 
sons enough for conferring success upon a volume 
of critical papers, they are not far to seek in Mr. 
James Ashcroft Noble's " The Sonnet in England, 
and Other Essays" (Way & Williams). A re- 
perusal of this book in a well-made second edition, 
printed, presumably without change, from the edi- 
tion of 1892, is a pleasure to which one can testify 
with no very great reservations as to major matters. 
The initial paper, one of the more noticeable of the 
reviews written hpropos of the appearance in 1880 



of Mr. Main's " Treasury of English Sonnets," is 
still (where other commentators have lost themselves 
in questions of origins and devious rulings about 
form) sensible and suggestive, and, for the survey 
which it purports to be of the sonnet in this special 
field, unusually practical. On the subject of the 
sonnets of Rossetti also, and of " The Germ " (the 
pre-Raphaelite magazine which is the subject of the 
second paper), Mr. Noble shows something more 
than the mere timeliness of periodical writing. 
Other numbers are on Robert Buchanan's poetry ; a 
kind of defence of unlucky Leigh Hunt ; and a 
monograph of Hawker of Morwenstow, the pictur- 
esque poet-priest of Cornwall, who is himself enough 
to give a book a second edition. 



A record of " To renew our fondness for the 

some literary motherland by thumbing over the 

pilgrimages. pageg Q f hep gtory \^ obviously 

enough, the motive of Miss Alice Brown's " By Oak 
and Thorn : A Record of English Days " (Hough- 
ton). If the record is a good deal mixed with fic- 
tion, it is because " the dwelling-places of great and 
beloved souls," for her, include both the actual and 
the imaginary, and " Here stood," or " Here might 
have stood " is as potent as " Here stands." A pil- 
grimage into Devon, ' The Haunt of the Doones," 
" The Land of Arthur," Eastcheap for Falstaff 's 
sake, and Knutsford or Cranford for Mrs. Gaskill's, 
among the journeyings undertaken, have something 
significant in their added and somewhat naive testi- 
mony to the power of England over certain phases 
of the American literary mind. The style, with 
its drollities of phrase, its allusions, quotations, 
rhythms, apostrophes, shows more than ever the 
results of eager reading. Perhaps the best paper is 
that on " The BrontS Country," where subject and 
treatment and actual circumstance are most clearly 
in accord. 



Knowing trees 
by their leaves. 



Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews, in his 
" Familiar Trees and their Leaves " 
(Appleton), explains the character- 
istic differences between the members of the great 
tree families in a way to be easily understood. The 
appreciative reader will soon find himself plucking 
branches from the wayside trees and identifying 
them by means of the fine illustrations and admir- 
able descriptions here presented. Mr. Mathews 
classifies the trees according to the shapes and posi- 
tions of the leaves, as simple or compound, oppo- 
site or alternate, toothed or untoothed; but adds 
also, for the benefit of the novice, descriptions of 
bark, fruit, contour of the tree, habits, and minor 
items. The book is a study of the trees from the 
view-point not only of science, but of beauty. The 
illustrations, over two hundred in number, are de- 
serving of special note ; they were drawn by the 
author from nature, and preserve wonderfully the 
grace and charm of the originals. The book is one 
to read, and then to keep at hand for continual 
reference.

[Aug. 16, 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. A. E. H. Swaen has edited the best plays of Van- 
brugh for the " Mermaid " series (imported by Seribner), 
giving us texts of "The Relapse," "The Provok'd Wife," 
" The Confederacy," and "A Journey to London." The 
apparatus of the volume includes a bibliography, a gen- 
ealogical table, a biographical notice, and Leigh Hunt's 
essay, copiously annotated. There is also a fine etched 
frontispiece from Kneller's portrait. The editor's opin- 
ion of Vanbrugh is that, " though less witty than Con- 
greve, he surpasses him in humor," and that " as a man 
he decidedly takes the foremost place "among the 
Restoration dramatists, " for, besides being a clever 
writer, he was an eminent architect, possessed noble 
qualities, and led an active life." 

The classical instructors of Harvard University have 
just issued another (the sixth) of those volumes of 
" Studies" which that austere censor, Mr. Andrew Lang, 
has recently used to point a rebuke to the levity of his 
countrymen. Professor John Williams White repub- 
lishes his convincing argument that the Opisthodomus 
was a detached building, and not a part of the Parthenon 
temple. Professor J. H. Wright discusses a Votive 
tablet to Artemis in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. 
Mr. William N. Bates endeavors to fix the date of that 
Lycophron the Obscure whom " every schoolboy knows " 
to have been Macaulay's pocket companion. Mr. Mau- 
rice Mather writes in Latin on verbs compounded with 
jacio, and Mr. George Edwin Howes presents a useful 
and interesting compilation and discussion of all the 
Homeric quotations in Plato and Aristotle. 

David Baptie's small volume, " Sketches of the Glee 
Composers " (imported by Seribner) gives brief biog- 
raphies of the principal glee composers between the 
years 1735 and 1866. In every case are given the 
number of each writer's glees, an ample list of his best 
pieces, and a statement of the kinds of voices for which 
each is written, thus forming a useful handbook and 
guide for directors of glee clubs and choral societies. 

We have frequently had occasion to praise " The 
University Series " of handbooks for the use of Exten- 
sion students. A thoroughly admirable book on " Shak- 
spere and His Predecessors " (Seribner), by Mr. Fred- 
erick S. Boas, is the latest issue in this series, and our 
only complaint is that it attempts to do too much for a 
single volume. Of the 555 pages, all but 88 are de- 
voted to Shakespeare himself, and the introductory 
chapters on the mediaeval drama, Marlowe, Kyd, Lyly, 
Peele, and Greene, are necessarily out of perspective. 
Mr. Boas has evidently worked through the whole mass 
of modern Shakespearian criticism, and his selection of 
material shows discriminating judgment and rare schol- 
arship. A better guide to the study of the dramatist 
has never been written. 

Professor R. G. Moulton's big book on " The Literary 
Study of the Bible " (Heath) is made somewhat for- 
bidding by its pedantic analytical schemes and classifi- 
cation, yet will repay examination. Mr. Moulton has a 
fine sense of the literary qualities of the scriptural writ- 
ings, and the special object of his work is to awaken 
this sense in its readers. He accepts the results of the 
" higher criticism," although they do not enter very con- 
siderably into a work the chief purpose of which is lit- 
erary rather than historical analysis. He uses the text 
of the Revised Version, and treats the Apocrypha as an 
essential part of the Bible. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

" Life on the Mississippi " is added by Messrs. Har- 
per & Brothers to their attractive library edition of 
" Mark Twain." 

Lady Tennyson died on the tenth of this month. Her 
maiden name was Emily Selwood, and she was married 
to the poet in 1850. 

Dr. Weir Mitchell's new novel, " Hugh Wynne, Free 
Quaker," will appear as a serial in the " Century " 
magazine, beginning with November. 

We have received the first number, dated July, of 
" Ex Libris," a neat quarterly published under the au- 
spices of the Washington Ex Libris Society. 

The Rev. T. A. Goodwin's " Lovers Three Thousand 
Years Ago," a study of the Song of Songs, is reprinted 
by the Open Court Publishing Co. in their " Religion 
of Science " library. 

Dr. George C. Keidel, of the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, has published " A Manual of JEsopic Fable Liter- 
ature " in the series of " Romance and Other Studies " 
upon which he is at work. 

"The Phantom Ship," " Snarley-yow," and " Olla 
Podrida " are volumes just added to the library edition 
of Marryatt now issuing from the press of Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. The latter volume includes " The Pirate " 
and " The Three Cutters." 

England has been going in for literary memorials of 
late. Within the space of a few days last month there 
were unveiled a Massinger window in a Southwark 
church, a bust of Dr. Arnold in Westminster Abbey, a 
statue of Cardinal Newman at Brompton Oratory, and 
a monument to Heminge and Condell in the churchyard 
of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury. 

Mr. Henry S. Salt, socialist, vegetarian, anti-vivi- 
sectionist, and philosophical radical, has always been one 
of the stoutest champions of Shelley's memory against 
the many attacks that have been directed against it on 
personal and critical grounds. He made the poet the 
subject of two monographs some years ago, and now 
adds a third to the list. " Percy Bysshe Shelley, Poet 
and Pioneer " (Scribner) is the title of the new volume, 
which is not content with the apologetic attitude assumed 
by most of Shelley's admirers, but is boldly aggressive, 
defending both the poet's character and principles in the 
most positive way. The thing is perhaps a little over- 
done, but on the whole we think Mr. Salt more nearly 
right than wrong, and commend his work as a brilliant 
and well-nigh convincing piece of special pleading.

International Bimetallism. 

By FRANCIS A. WALKER, President of Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, author of " Political Econ- 
omy," " Money," " The Wages Question," " Money, 
Trade, and Industry," etc. 12mo, $1.25. 

The book is the outcome of a course of lectures delivered at 
Harvard University this spring, and was prepared without 
reference to the impending political contest in the United States. 
It, however, will prove instructive not only upon the question 
which is destined to underlie that great struggle, but will also 
be found a valuable work of reference, treating, as it does, of 
the precious metals from the earliest times down to the present 
day. 

" In our opinion the best book yet published in the English language 
for the exposition of the distinctively economic questions at issue be- 
tween bimetallists and the monometallists." The Outlook. 

" For those who wish to learn the philosophical basis of bimetallism, 
doubtless there is no better book than this. " Boston Times. 

" It will, without doubt, hold a large place among the books destined 
to have an influence upon the voters of this country at the coming elec- 
tion, in which the gold and silver question plays so important a part." 
Hartford Post. 

" There is a wealth of information in this book." Denver Times. 

" The book is a timely one, and can be consulted with profit by those, 
whether holding to one view or the other, who desire to study the ques- 
tion dispassionately from all sides." Cleveland Plain Dealer, 

" A storehouse of information especially acceptable at this time, and 
we commend it to the perusal of all who feel an interest in the engross-

A SELECTION FROM CHAUCER'S CANTERBURY TALES. 

Edited for Schools by HIRAM CORSON, Professor of English Literature, Cornell University. 12mo. 

The Introduction will comprise : 1 A Biographical Sketch, confined to what is known with certainty of Chaucer. 2 The 
More Characteristic Features of his Poetry. 3 Chaucer' 1 s Versification. 4 The Pronunciation of the English of the 14th 
Century, as determined by Ellis and others. 5 A Synopsis of Grammatical Forms, the residuals and modifications of Anglo- 
Saxon inflections. 6 Brief Arguments of the Tales represented in the book. 

Notes and Glossary are appended to the text. The Notes will be more of a literary character than philological. It has not 
been thought necessary to give in the Glossary, except to a very limited extent, the etymology of words which are still in the 
language, and which are recognizable in any of their 14th Century forms. Where they are not so recognizable they are explained 
by their modern forms, and when necessary by additional other words defining the meanings they may have in Chaucer different 
from their present meanings.

.AN IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL 
DOCUMENT. 

Mr. D. R. Cameron, for many years a mem- 
ber of the Chicago Board of Education and 
for the past two years its President, has just 
retired from his office in connection with that 
body, and has made his final report the occa- 
sion for a number of suggestions concerning 
the future policy of the city schools. This re- 
port is a weighty document, the product of 
much reflection and experience, and is charac- 
terized throughout by good clear sense and a 
recognition of the leading principles for which 
public educators are everywhere contending. 
The suggestions made by Mr. Cameron are so 
well stated, and follow so closely in the line of 
the best educational thought as far as that 
thought deals with the problem of the large city 
school system that we make no apology for 
bringing the essential contents of the report 
before a wider audience than can be secured 
for them by fragmentary publication in the 
daily newspapers of Chicago. 

The management of the public schools in a 
large municipality is a serious matter, calling 
for the best appliances and the most careful 
consideration. How large a concern it is in 
this particular instance may best be illustrated 
by a few figures taken from the statistics of the 
year that ended with last June. The enrollment 
of pupils for the year was 215,784, the number 
of schools was 224, and the total expenditure 
$7,328,531. The two chief problems presented 
are the management of this enormous sum of 
money, and the direction of the educational 
forces brought to bear upon the training of 
this large army of youthful citizens. With 
these two problems Mr. Cameron's report is 
chiefly concerned, and both are dealt with in a 
preeminently enlightened way. 

As to the first of these questions, the recom- 
mendation is thus stated : 

" It is my belief that a competent man of affairs, with 
large executive powers, conversant with men and values, 
informed as to the mutual interest of all parties con- 
cerned in financial transactions of the board, inflexible 
in demanding and dispensing justice in all matters of 
reciprocal interests, if chosen to act in the capacity of, 
let me suggest, a business directory of all its business 
affairs, subject always to review of the board, at a lib- 
eral salary, would by the introduction of business meth- 
ods into the administration of our affairs so effect a sav-

salary many times over, and bring about a more rational 
system of procedure in all our business relations." 

Such a statement almost carries conviction in 
its train. In the management of large concerns, 
public or private, all experience goes to show 
that the best results are obtained when exec- 
utive powers are concentrated and responsi- 
bilities enlarged. The business of a board of 
education that expends seven or eight millions 
annually cannot be effectively and economically 
controlled by committees and <^cm-independ- 
ent departments. It demands the same sort of 
ability that is required of the president of a 
great banking or railway corporation. Such 
ability commands a high price, but it is to be 
found in the market, and its employment would 
be a real economy. It is, moreover, unfair to 
expect from the members of a board of educa- 
tion, whose services are entirely gratuitous, the 
sort of devotion that is needed for this work of 
business superintendence. Men who have oc- 
cupations of their own cannot be expected to 
this extent to neglect their own interests, and 
many of the most capable members of the Chi- 
cago Board of Education have found them- 
selves forced to resign because they simply 
could not, in justice to themselves, meet the 
multifarious demands made upon them by their 
office, yet were too conscientious to be willing 
to neglect them. Mr. Cameron's proposal offers 
a way out of this difficulty, and its adoption 
would make it possible to enlist the services of 
the best men in the community without exact- 
ing from them an unreasonable portion of their 
time and energy. 

On the subject of the strictly educational 
work of the Board the report is equally out- 
spoken, and equally in line with the most com- 
petent educational thought. We read : 

"Especially should the educational department be 
left free from non-professional interference and restric- 
tion, and the legal power of the appointment and removal 
of teachers in the largest measure consonant with the 
right of review by the board be cheerfully committed 
to the Superintendent of Schools and his assistants. It 
scarcely needs an argument to convince any member of 
this board that the outlook of these executive officers 
over the educational field, their knowledge of school 
affairs at home and abroad, their acquaintance with the 
trend and scope of educational thought, their familiar 
associations with questions pertaining to school manage- 
ment and discipline, their experience with school life, 
their trained judgment as to professional merit in teach- 
ing, their professional pride, all unite to justify the 
commission to their hands, unrestricted by individual 
members of the board, or by non-professional parties, 
the selection, appointment, assignment, and transfer of 
teachers, the removal of incompetents, and the promo- 



tion of teachers to fill vacancies occurring in the more 
important positions." 

This is admirably concise and logical ; what 
the writer calls his own " solemn conviction " 
on the subject is also the conviction of every 
serious educator in the country. There is no 
question, either in this proposition or in the 
preceding one relating to business manage- 
ment, of any abdication of authority on the 
part of the Board of Education. There is sim- 
ply the question of a voluntary limitation of 
the action of that body to the larger aspects 
of the public school policy, leaving all the de- 
tails to the decision of competent executive 
agents. 

Mr. Cameron refers in pointed terms to the 
action taken last spring by the Chicago Council 
whereby the school appropriation for 1897 was 
made two millions short of what is obviously 
needed. On this subject he says : 

" In view of the almost unprecedented growth of the 
population of the city and the corresponding increase of 
school membership, the reduction of financial resources 
beyond those of the last preceding year seems like a 
suicidal act, an act at least without the sanction or sug- 
gestion of an enlightened policy. The whole policy of 
a government is summed up in the requirement edu- 
cate or punish. To neglect the former is to render the 
latter obligatory. The wisdom of the one is set over 
against the folly of the other. To cheapen the one is to 
multiply the cost of the other by a large ratio. In the 
face of this fact, the board is unhappily urged, nay 
forced, to a most rigid line of economy and retrench- 
ment, whereby the possibility of financial embarrassment 
may be avoided. It is not a condition to be viewed with 
any feeling of complacency, that of a retrograde move- 
ment in the management of the schools because of the 
fact that the board is shorn of the legitimate and neces- 
sary means for carrying to a successful issue the legal 
requirements of its department." 

It is shown that during 1895-6, for the first 
time in years, new schools were built fast enough 
to keep pace with the growth of the school pop- 
ulation. The reduction for the coming year 
means simply that building must stop alto- 
gether for a time, making it much harder than 
before to " catch up " when it is made possible 
again to go on with the work. 

One more recommendation of importance re- 
mains to be noticed. The success of the exper- 
imental vacation school carried on in Chicago 
this summer by private subscription has been 
so marked that a real educational need is indi- 
cated. Such schools should, of course, be very 
different in plan and method from those of the 
regular school year, and the slight experience 
already had with them shows how successful 
they might be made. Mr. Cameron, at all 
events, has taken to heart the lesson of this 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



summer's experiment, for he urges the organ- 
ization of a large number of such vacation 
schools, and, at the same time, suggests that 
the regular school year should be shortened 
one month. If the latter suggestion were made 
by itself, its wisdom might be doubtful, but 
coupled as it is with the plan for vacation 
schools, it commends itself to the intelligence. 
There is no doubt that the summer climate of 
Chicago is too tropical for the year of forty 
weeks that has hitherto been maintained. A 
school term that runs from the beginning of 
September to the close of June is sure to en- 
counter some unendurably hot weather at both 
ends. During such weather almost nothing of 
value is accomplished, and it is extremely prob- 
able that a curtailment of the term would result 
in no real loss to the work of the year. For the 
value of that work is not to be decided by any 
rule of thumb, but results from a complex of 
forces in which the tone and vitality of teach- 
ers and students is probably the most impor- 
tant factor. This is particularly true in the 
higher grades of the work, while any loss that 
might be felt in the lower grades would be 
more than compensated by the attractive and 
wholesome training of the vacation schools, 
should both features of Mr. Cameron's sugges- 
tion commend themselves to the wisdom of the 
authorities. All the suggestions made in his 
report are richly deserving of consideration, 
and it is a good omen for public education in 
Chicago that so ripe and thoughtful a docu- 
ment should have been presented to the atten- 
tion of the body in whose hands the interests 
of the schools are placed. 



CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH. 

Is conversation becoming with us a lost art, and 
the correct use of its medium a thing of the past? 
This is a question calling for the serious considera- 
tion of educators of the young. Spelling and com- 
position receive attention perhaps out of proportion 
to their relative importance ; some of the methods 
of teaching the former as, for example, the sing- 
ing of the letters being very peculiar, and demand- 
ing an undue share of the pupil's time. But neither 
in school nor at home are correct habits of speech 
inculcated. In no country in the world do the ed- 
ucated classes pay so little attention to correctness 
of accent, clearness of enunciation, and the observ- 
ance of grammatical rules, as in our own. Even 
in New England, where, during the first half of the 
century, taking the whole population together, per- 
haps the best English in the world was spoken, there 
has been a sad degeneration. 



The pulpit makes some pretence to the correct 
use of English, but even here colloquialisms are not 
rare. The writer recently heard a clergyman of 
some claims to culture and refinement, in the course 
of a sermon on the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, 
exclaim with much fervor : " Oh, my brethren, what 
a blessed world this would be if only we were all 
plumb full of God ! " Another preacher whom he 
frequently hears is addicted to deploring, in his 
exhortations to spiritual-mindedness, a too great 
desire to "keep up with the procession." The bar 
has long ago given up the attempt to furnish a 
model in the use of English. Not a few lawyers 
purposely make use of slang and faulty grammar 
in court, thinking thus more surely to hold the atten- 
tion of the jury. 

As has often been observed, Europeans pay more 
attention to their speech than we do, because in all 
leading European countries correct and refined 
utterance is an indispensable requisite for attaining 
good social position. Irish and Scotch barristers, 
seeking to make their mark at the English bar, take 
incredible pains to get rid of their native accent. 
Lord Campbell succeeded so far in this endeavor 
that he said his Scotch origin was finally discover- 
able only through two or three words which were 
always more than he could master ; one of them was 
solicitor, which he always made soleeeitor. In 
France, Germany, and Italy, as well as in England, 
among the educated classes the child's speech is 
watched as carefully as are his manners and morals. 
To the upper classes of society is assigned the care 
of their native tongue, and neglect in this matter 
is punished by loss of social consideration. A little 
experience abroad will make an American painfully 
conscious of his national defect. In the very act 
of introducing himself to a German as an Ameri- 
kaner, he will almost certainly slur the unaccented 
vowels, and, if he be from New England, fail to give 
due value to the letter r. It is then that he will 
begin to deplore the birthright of the modern Amer- 
ican, the liberty to talk in any way he pleases, and 
to produce a jargon of slovenly pronunciation and 
street slang, uttered with a harsh nasal twang. Let 
us beware of reaching the condition of Greece and 
Rome of old, and of Turkey and parts of Germany 
and France and other European countries of to-day, 
where the literary and the spoken languages are 
entirely distinct, and the uneducated man is obliged 
to study a book in his own tongue as he would a 
foreign language. 

Of course, the most assiduous attention to the 
rules of good talking will not produce conversation ; 
for, as the " Poet at the Breakfast-table " says : 
" Good talk is not a matter of will at all ; it depends 
you know we are all half-materialists nowadays 
on a certain amount of active congestion of the 
brain, and that comes when it is ready, and not 
before." As in producing fire with tinder, flint, and 
steel, so in conversation, " after hammering away 
with mere words, the spark of a happy expression 
takes somewhere among the mental combustibles, 



108 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



and then we have a pretty, wandering, scintillating 
play of eloquent thought that enlivens, if it does not 
kindle, all around it." And then we are told that 
the explanation of the phenomenon lies in the fact 
that a " chance thought or expression strikes the 
nervous centre of consciousness, as the rowel of a 
spur stings the flank of a racer. Away through all 
the telegraphic radiations of the nervous cords 
flashes the intelligence that the brain is kindling, 
and must be fed with something or other, or burn 
to ashes. And all the great hydraulic engines pour 
in their scarlet blood a stream like burning rock- 
oil. You can 't order these organic processes any 
more than a milliner can make a rose." 

Too great an effort to make conversation is dis- 
astrous to its spontaneity and charm. All have had 
experience of those men of esprit who, in the words 
of the " Autocrat," " have what may be called jerky 
minds. Their thoughts do not run in the natural 
order of sequence. They say bright things on all 
possible subjects, but their zigzags rack you to death. 
After a jolting half-hour with one of these jerky 
companions, talking with a dull friend affords great 
relief. It is like taking the cat in your lap after 
holding a squirrel." 

Equally wearisome is the man with whom con- 
versation is impossible because he talks always in 
monologue. Coleridge would pump his listeners 
full on the slightest provocation. " Zounds ! I was 
never so bethumped with words," exclaimed Sir 
Walter Scott, in describing a dinner-party at which 
he was forced to listen to a long and learned ha- 
rangue from the Highgate sage, on Homer and the 
Samothracian mysteries and the Wolfian hypothesis. 
Theodore Hook, after enduring a three-hours dis- 
course from " the rapt one with the god-like fore- 
head " a monologue suggested by the sight of two 
soldiers sitting by the roadside exclaimed : " Thank 
heaven ! you did not see a regiment, Coleridge, for 
in that case you would never have stopped." The 
true master of the ready give-and-take of conversa- 
tion, as distinguished from monologue, is like Mr. 
Bagehot's subtle reader in the essay on Gibbon : he 
pursues with a fine attention the most delicate and 
imperceptible ramifications of a topic, " marks slight 
traits, notes changing manners, is minutely atten- 
tive to every prejudice and awake to every passion, 
watches syllables and waits on words, is alive to the 
light airs of nice association which float about every 
subject the motes in the bright sunbeam the 
delicate gradations of the passing shadows." 

A common trick of the man who would converse 
fluently is to guide the conversation into some path- 
way already many times trodden by him into one 
of those ruts or grooves into which, especially if he 
be a professor or lecturer or schoolmaster or clergy- 
man, his conversation is perpetually sliding. This 
is not a practice to be followed. We like rather to 
converse with such men as Sydney Smith, who 
talked not for display, but because his mind was a 
spring bubbling over with ideas, and, as he said, he 
must speak or burst. He talked on any subject that 



was started, rarely starting anything of his own, and 
making it a rule to take as many half-minutes as 
he could get, but never to talk more than a half- 
minute without pausing, in order that others might 
have an opportunity to strike in. In this he was 
quite unlike the Frenchman who observed the con- 
trary principle, and caused an envious and impa- 
tient rival, watching for an opening, to murmur: 
" S'il crache ou tousse, il est perdu ! " 

In general company, the conversational style 
should be light and constantly passing from theme 
to theme. If, as Dr. Johnson has said, solid con- 
versation be indulged in, " people differ in opinion, 
and get into bad humor, or some of the company, 
who are not capable of such conversation, are left 
out, and feel themselves uneasy." For this reason 
Sir Robert Walpole said he always talked gossip 
and scandal at his table, because in that none were 
too shallow-brained to join. Whatever be the theme 
of conversation, whether weighty or light, much 
depends, for its ready flow and entire success, on 
how much is taken " for granted and how much is 
left unsaid. Conversationalists should beware of 
insisting on nothing but absolute truths rigidly 
stated in the form of propositions. Conversation, 
like the other fine arts, aims at the ideal, and must 
be allowed to state its truths with embellishment, 
with modification, or even with exaggeration. One 
man who persists in being literal can spoil the talk 
of a whole company of wits ; like the production of 
a well-trained orchestra, " its fluent harmonies may 
be spoiled by the intrusion of a single harsh note." 

Bacon has a word to say on the mode of delivery 
in his " Short Notes for Civil Conversation " 
which may be of interest. " In all kinds of speech," 
he says, " either pleasant, grave, severe, or ordinary, 
it is convenient to speak leisurely, and rather drawl- 
ingly, than hastily : because hasty speech confounds 
the memory, and oftentimes, besides the unseemli- 
ness, drives the man either to stammering, a non-plus, 
or harping on that which should follow ; whereas a 
slow speech confirmeth the memory, addeth a conceit 
of wisdom to the hearers, besides a seemliness of 
speech and countenance." p EBCY p. BICKNELL.

Yet, when he takes it whose the instrument, 

There is no other unto poets sent 

Viol nor flute doth such high rapturings ! 

These two short cords breathe out a thousand things:

Even as the harper will. Alas ! when one

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

DOGMATIC PHILOLOGY. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

A specimen of false philology, even more remarkable 
than the one pointed out by a correspondent in your 
issue of August 1, appears in the following paragraph 
on p. 212 of the new " Practical Rhetoric " referred to 
in your correspondent's communication : 

" Pure sentences are grammatically accurate, and true to 
the genius of the English tongue ; that is, idiomatic (from a 
Greek word meaning one's own). To write in the idiom of a 
language is to employ its characteristic modes of expression. 
A man may use correct, hut not idiomatic, English. . . . So, 
by the English idiom, only transitive verbs can take a genu- 
ine passive. 'He is gone' (elegant French) ; 'He was now 
advanced within ten miles of the Sambre ' (a translator's ren- 
dering of Caesar's elegant Latin), are not regarded as idiom- 
atic by the best English writers. He has gone is the elegant 
English equivalent of i7 est parti." 

The author of the above evidently mistakes is gone, 
a genuine perfect active, for a present passive. But the 
most surprising thing is that he should regard is gone 
as a Gallicism, and hence unidiomatic. A glance into 
an Anglo-Saxon grammar, or comparison with similar 
forms in modern German, would have revealed that the 
perfect and pluperfect tenses of intransitive verbs are 
regularly formed with be, of transitive verbs with have. 
Has gone is therefore originally a blunder, now ratified 
by usage, just as hat gegangen would be a blunder in 
German. Compare the lines in "Lycidas": 

" And now the sun had stretched out all the hills, 

And now was dropt into the western hay." 
The tense is the same in both; there is certainly no 
passive in sight. Other examples in the same poem are: 
" Now thou art gone, and never must return." 
" That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed." 

Under such instruction as the foregoing paragraph 
conveys, how would the student come to regard Burke's 
famous passage, "But the age of chivalry is gone," or 
many well remembered passages of the English Bible, 
such as " Babylon is fallen," " Think not that I am 
come," etc.? 

In these days when Anglo-Saxon grammars are lying 
around in every English lecture-room, that a college 
teacher of English, of " twenty years' experience," should 
have escaped the contagion, is simply astounding. But 
our author's dogma in no way invalidates the soundness 
of his doctrine in another paragraph: 

" With writers who pretend to instruct others, but are them- 
selves destitute of the first great essential to success, clear 
vision of the subject taught, obscurity is inevitable." 

After reading in the Preface, " An invaluable aid to 
such as desire to speak with propriety and elegance will 
be found in Lessons XXI. and XXII. on common mis- 
usages," one turns to these chapters with some degree 
of interest. Much that is useful and necessary to the 
young student is found there, along with much that 
tends to purism, rather than to purity, of speech. One 
is reminded at every turn of the stock of inhibited 
phrases that were going the rounds of the newspapers 
a few years ago. Thus, we read: 

" Try should be followed by a verb in the infinitive : ' Try 
to exert yourself.' Avoid the colloquialisms, ' Try and do it,' 
'come and see me,' imitations of classical usage." 

Having occasion, the other day, to read over Matthew 
Arnold's " Essay on Celtic Literature," I noted four 
examples of this construction, which was evidently good 



enough for him, one of the greatest of modern stylists: 

" I have no pretension to do more than to try and awaken 
interest." 

" But before we go on to try and verify, in our life and lit- 
erature, the alleged fact of this commingling," etc. 

" And now to try and trace these in the composite English 
genius." 

" seeing our American brothers themselves have rather, 

like us, to try and moderate the flame of Anglo-Saxonism in 
their breasts." 

(See also the " International Dictionary " under and.) 

We are informed, further, that 

" Adjectives follow verbs of existing, seeming, and feeling ; 
as, to feel bad, never badly, unless the reference is to a blind 
man beginning to depend on his fingers." 

Is one, then, always to feel bad, never badly, to feel 
poor always, never poorly, to look sick, never sickly, 
kind, and never kindly ? Who says that sickly, poorly, 
kindly, goodly, badly (in this use), are not adjectives as 
well as lovely, friendly, daily, etc.? But it is not a ques- 
tion of " intuitive philology "; is it then a fact of lan- 
guage ? Here are a few examples, selected at random: 

" I do not mean American coins, for those look less badly, 
the more they lose of their original ugliness." Lowell, Big- 
low Papers, Introduction. 

In "The Foundations of Rhetoric," by Professor A. S. 
Hill of Harvard, " I came in late, and I felt bad when I wrote 
this theme " is corrected into " I came in late, and I felt badly 
when I wrote this theme," with the remark : "In this exam- 
ple, bad might, according to the rule just stated, seem to be 
the proper word. The reason for preferring badly is that bad 
is ambiguous, ' bad ' being used in two senses." 
The only sensible rule would seem to be, when you feel 
bad, say so; and when you feel badly, say so, if you 
want to. 

Our Practical Rhetorician further says: 

" In our midst, for in the midst of us, is severely criticised 
on the ground that we cannot possess a midst ; the English 
possessive, in its modern use, being almost exclusively limited 
to the notion of property (usage approves 'a week's pay'). 
Old English writers used in the midst.' 1 ' 1 

Possess a midst ! Must we, then, give up " in our be- 
half," " for our sake," " in our rear," etc., because we do 
not possess a behalf, a sake, a rear? The use of the 
possessive adjective in the sense of an objective geni- 
tive is not uncommon in any language. To illustrate, I 
quote from general literature: 

Sophocles, Trach. 485: Sen charin (for sou), equiva- 
lent to gratia tua (for tut), for thy sake (for of tliee) . 
Homer, Od. II., 202: Sos pothos (desiderium tuum). 
Catullus, II., 2 : periculo invidiae meae. 
Cicero, Plane. I., 2: Vester conspectus rejicit et recreat 
mentem meam (the sight of you, etc.). 
Schiller, "Maria Stuart," III., 4: 

" Die fromme Pflicht der Sch wester zu erf iillen, 
Und meines Anblicks Trost gewahr' ich euch." 
Moliere, " Le Misanthrope," 2, 3 : 

" C'est nn homme a jamais ne me le pardonner, 
S'il savait que sa vue efit pu m' importuner." 
Spenser, "Faerie Queene," III., 27: 

" For since mine eye your joyous sight did miss." 
Chauteaubriand : 

" Leur souvenir fait tous les jours 

Ma peine " (Remembrance of them, etc.). 
"Ich bin's, bin Faust, bin deines Gleichen." 
" We ne'er shall look upon his like again " (similem ejus). 
"The deep damnation of his taking off." 
This use of the possessive is not only general, in this 



110

[Sept. 1, 



particular phrase, so unjustly condemned, it is purely 
idiomatic. Compare the Anglo-Saxon Gospels with the 
Latin Vulgate: 

" Tha nam he anne cnapsn and gesette on hyra middele." 
Mark IX., 36. 

" Et accipiens puerum statuit eum in media eorum." 
Wiclif 's literal translation of the Vulgate doubtless had 
its influence in the more general acceptance of " in the 
midst of." With the Anglo-Saxon compare the German: 

" Den nehm ich jetzt heraus aus eurer Mitte." Schiller, W. 
Tell, 3, 3. 

" dass man den Freund 

Aus eurer Mitte fiihrte." 4, 2. 
"Verschwanden ist meine Bertha . . ausunsrer Mitte. 1 ' 4,2. 

Whether one should say " in our midst " or " in the 
midst of us " seems merely a question of style. Both 
are right. 

Comments on other locutions will have to lie over till 
another time. In conclusion, in the words of Dr. Fitz- 
edward Hall, " Philology is no province of ecclesiastics; 
it is not a species of theology, half dogmatism and half 
denunciation. Its materials are facts which admit of 
rigid verification; and its processes are simple applica- 
tions of common-sense." EDWARD A. ALLEN.

THE "PASSIVE VOICE WITH OBJECT" IN 

JAPANESE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It may interest those readers who followed the dis- 
cussion of " The Passive Voice with an Object " in your 
columns, to learn that this is a common construction in 
the Japanese language. Indeed, it may be said, with 
reference to the vernacular of this country, that from 
one point of view it has no passive, but from another 
point of view its passive is a real one. Professor B. H. 
Chamberlain, late Professor of Japanese Literature in 
the Imperial University of Japan, who has no superior, 
perhaps no equal, as an authority on the language and 
literature of this nation, says in his " Handbook of Col- 
loquial Japanese " : " Properly speaking, the so-called 
passive is not a passive at all, but an active in disguise. 
Such a form as utareru, for instance, is etymologically 
itchi* an' 2 erw 3 , as literally as possible, 'to get 3 being 2 
beating 1 ,' i. e., ' to get a beating,' ' to get beaten,' hence 
'to be beaten.' . . . Intransitive verbs [also] are sus- 
ceptible of passive forms, such as furareru, 'to get 
rained upon,' ' to have it rain,' from furu, ' to rain.' " 
And yet, though in form the Japanese passive is " an 
active in disguise," yet in meaning it seems to be a true 
passive, inasmuch as it represents the suffering or the 
receiving of an action. 

With reference to the use of an object with a passive 
verb in Japanese, let me quote one or two illustrations 
from the above - mentioned Handbook. " Kubi wo 
hanerareta " (in which " wo " is the accusative postposi- 
tion) means literally, " Head got-struck-off," i. e. " [He] 
got [his] head cut off," or loosely, " [His] head was cut 
off." "Ashi wo inu ni kuitsukaremashita " means lit- 
erally, " Leg dog by [I] have-got-bitten," i. e., " [I] have 
had [my] leg bitten by a dog," or, " [I] have been bitten 
in the leg by a dog." The expression, "A dog has bitten 
[my] leg," would be, " Inu ga ashi wo kuitsukimashita." 

The examples quoted by " W. H. J." will take the 
same construction when translated into Japanese. For 
instance, " He was asked a question " becomes " Kare 
wa toi wo kakerareta "/ and " I was taught to sing [sing- 
ing] " becomes " Watakushi wa shoka wo oshierareta." 



It will thus be seen that " this logical and well- 
accredited form of speech," of using an accusative with 
a passive (transitive) verb, is perhaps even more com- 
mon in Japanese than in English. And this is not the 
only instance where the Japanese language is more log- 
ical than the English language.

THE JOURNALISM OF PARTS OF SPEECH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Parts of speech are generally classed amongst small 
matters by those who fail to realize that they are no 
smaller to know than to be ignorant of, and that when 
small matters are pertinent at all, they are as large as 
the largest matters. The editor of " The Bookman," in 
answer to the criticism that " none but he could have 
written " should be " none but him" etc., says that but 
here would be explained, " not as a preposition, but as 
an adverb, equivalent to ' only ' a common enough 
usage." As there is no such equivalence and no such 
usage, the conclusion is irresistible that the editor, though 
a college professor of Latin, not only cannot tell the 
parts of speech in English, but does not even know the 
principle of their classification. There is an adverbial 
use of but in such cases as " If I had but known "; and 
there is a vulgar colloquialism, not of but for only, but 
of only for but, as in "I never sleep, only at night"; 
but neither of these cases is analagous to the phrase in 
question, to which the editor's explanation does not apply. 
However, assuming that his explanation does apply, the 
inquiry obtrudes itself, What is the construction of he ? 
Being in the nominative case, it cannot fill any of the 
functions of that case appropriate to the preceding 
words, and its force must be sought in connection with 
what follows in sense. Thus tested, he is found to be 
the subject of could have written, that verb being read 
twice, once with none; and but is proved to be a conjunc- 
tion, a classification as common as is its prepositional use. 
An adverb, taking a case, becomes a preposition, and, 
taking a clause, becomes a conjunction; but here takes 
a clause, and can be explained only as a conjunction: if 
it were an adverb, it could modify nothing, he not being 
subject to adverbial modification. 

The same blunder has been made by the editors of 
" Latin Readings," published by the American Book Co. 
On prceter ille Papirius, they first called prceter an ad- 
verb. Criticism privately offered was resented, and their 
position defended by various citations ; but, in the second 
issue of the book, the note was changed to read " adverb, 
used as conjunction." CASKIE HARRISON.

A SECOND series of Mr. Charles G. Leland's " Legends 
of Florence " (Macmillau) should repeat the success 
scored by its sprightly predecessor. The tales bristle 
with fancies, quaint, grotesque, gruesome, or bewitch- 
ing; and Mr. Leland tells them in a quite inimitable 
way. The folk-lorist, the tourist, and the general reader 
may alike find their account in these pleasantly diver- 
sified pages, which are redolent of the atmosphere of 
old Florence. The tales are drawn from the fountain- 
head from the lips of the common people ; and in re- 
wording them Mr. Leland has very happily preserved 
the artless brevity and piquant phrase of the original 
narrators. The author's explanatory asides are instruct-

THE DISCOVERY AND NAMING or 
AMERICA.* 



The apparent motive in the preparation and 
publication of Mr. Thacher's volume on " The 
Continent of America " is not difficult to dis- 
cover. Its author had an ambition to relate the 
story of the discovery and naming of America 
on more sumptuous folio pages, set off by a 
greater wealth of illustration, than any of his 
predecessors. This cannot be called an un- 
worthy ambition ; and, so far as we are ac- 
quainted with competing works, it has been 
gratified. Indeed, in what we regard as its dis- 
tinguishing feature we do not know that the 
book has any real competitors. Some of the 
later historical writers have used a profusion of 
map reproductions and other illustrations with 
great advantage in their works ; but we recall 
nothing in its own sphere that can compete 
with the present work. In these respects, Mr. 
Thacher bears off the palm. We by no means 
deny other merits to his book, but the word of 
praise that has now been spoken is the highest 
word that can be accorded it. 

The author first deals, in three short chap- 
ters, with the gradual growth of cosmography 
and the nomenclature of the old continents. 
The familiar information about the first topic 
is illustrated with admirable reproductions of 
the familiar maps, " The World According to 
Homer," "The World of HecataBus," etc. 
Regarding the names of the continents, he has 
brought together an interesting collection of 
theories, with a view, apparently, of preparing 
the way for the congratulatory remark, that 
Americans not only know for whom their world 
is called, but the very day and hour of its bap- 
tismal ceremony. 

The vestibule passed, we find ourselves face 
to face with one of the two main theses of the 
book. This is, that Watling Island is the same 
island that the natives called Guanahani and 
Columbus renamed San Salvador ; or, in other 
words, that it was the scene of the landfall of 
October 12, 1492. From a modern point of 
view, it might seem strange that Guanahani

was ever lost sight of, or that its identity could 
become doubtful. Such, however, is the fact. 
The islands that contend for the honor of hav- 
ing been pressed by the Admiral's foot on that 
memorable morning is not smaller than the 
number of cities that contended for Homer. 
But we should not look at the matter from a 
modern point of view. The discovery of Amer- 
ica was an accident, and many subsequent dis- 
coveries made in the course of laying it open to 
the world were also accidents. The discoverers 
were not self-conscious ; often they did not 
know what they were doing, either because they 
read what they saw in the light of preconceived 
ideas, or for some other reason. Columbus and 
Cabot were both looking for Cathay ; their fol- 
lowers on the westward paths were frequently 
looking for what they did not find gold, or a 
passage to Asia, or a favorable seat for a plan- 
tation, or a native kingdom to conquer ; and 
why should it be thought strange that they 
sometimes disregarded, or did not plainly mark, 
what did not for the time being meet their expec- 
tations ? Then what havoc time has wrought 
with the literary memorials of that great 
period in history ! To-day the scientific spirit 
is first in the mind of the scholar who seeks to 
follow those paths, but it was commonly last in 
the minds of those who discovered the paths. 

The two letters that he wrote to Santangel 
and Sanchez, as he neared Spain on his return 
voyage, are the only contemporary printed ac- 
counts, our author tells us, of what Colum- 
bus had found in the West. Unfortunately, 
they throw no light on the spot of the landfall. 
We know that the Admiral kept a journal of 
his voyage, and that it was in existence for 
many years after his death ; but it has long 
been numbered among the lost historical treas- 
ures of the world. He wrote to the Catholic 
Princes that, besides the journal, he should 
draw up a nautical chart, which would include 
the several parts of the ocean and land that he 
visited in their proper situations, and a book to 
represent the whole by pictures with latitudes 
and longitudes ; but if he executed these works, 
they also are lost. But, fortunately, Ferdinand 
Columbus, who had in his possession his father's 
books and papers, wrote a biography of him 
(sometimes called the " Historic "), and this 
book contains an account of the landfall and 
of the subsequent voyage to Cuba. Again, Las 
Casas, who knew Columbus personally, and 
who at one time had the Navigator's manuscript 
journal in his possession, wrote an account of 
the first voyage, and this contains a still fuller 



112 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



account of the landfall and connected transac- 
tions. Still, there are unpleasant questions 
hanging around these documents, or rather the 
first one : Ferdinand's " Historie" was not pub- 
lished until 1571, and Las Casas's abridgment 
of the journal not until 1825. 

How, then, shall the inquirer proceed in his 
effort to identify Guanahani? Mr. Thacher 
lays down three methods. One is to apply to 
the Bahama Islands the physical descriptions 
of Guanahani found in Ferdinand Columbus 
and Las Casas ; another is to trace the course 
of the fleet backward from Cuba by means of 
the sailing memoranda found in the same 
works ; the third is to follow the history of the 
voyage from the Canaries to Cuba and note 
the distances sailed. The third method might 
seem to be the best one, but it fails completely. 
" At whatever island in the Bahama group we 
attempt to land by this reckoning, we find his 
log has overrun it by many miles " Watling 
Island by 317 miles. According to the method 
of his time, Columbus estimated his distances, 
and, like most other estimators, fell into exag- 
geration. Mr. Thacher holds that both the first 
and second methods of identification point con- 
clusively to Watling Island ; and, to give the 
reader an opportunity to judge of the argument 
for himself, he gives many pages of Ferdi- 
nando's history and Las Casas's abridgment of 
the journal, first the Spanish originals and 
then translations. Great names can be quoted 
in favor of other identifications ; but Mr. 
Thacher errs, if he errs, with a majority of the 
best later authorities. 

To most readers, Guanahani is but a name. 
This short quotation will help to make it a 
reality, provided always the identification is 
correct. 

" Watling Island has a political existence. Its pop- 
ulation of 673 souls unite with the 367 inhabitants of 
Rum Cay to form a constituency which sends one mem- 
ber to the House of Assembly for the Bahama Islands. 
The seat of local government is in the island of New 
Providence. It is said that at one time the island was 
celebrated for its live stock, and in particular horses, 
cargoes of these being sent annually to Jamaica. The 
principal settlement in the island is Cockburn Town, at 
the point where we find the landfall. It has a sea ap- 
proach, with a good and easy anchorage. On Dixon Hill, 
on the northeast end, is a lighthouse with the most pow- 
erful light in the Bahamas. It is situated in latitude 
24 6' and in longitude 74 26'" (p. 58). 

Mr. Thacher next takes up a question that 
is more difficult, and historically more impor- 
tant, than the identification of Guanahani. It 
is one of the vexed questions of early Ameri- 
can history, and starts up at once at mention 



of Americus Vespucius. This navigator has 
been most unfortunate. No one who reads the 
later books for a moment accepts the old tra- 
dition, to the effect that Vespucius attempted 
to rob Columbus of the glory of discovering 
America ; still, there is a Vespucian contro- 
versy, and a very strenuous one. The question 
is whether or not Vespucius first discovered the 
American continent. The competition does not 
lie between him and Columbus, but between 
him and John Cabot. Mr. Thacher sets Cabot 
aside in the following summary fashion : 

" If the voyage of John Cabot, alleged to have been 
made in the spring of 1497, to what is now the coast of 
the United States was worthy of credence, the ten days 
between May 10, as given in the primitive text, and 
May 20, as in the Latin translation of the St.-Die* edi- 
tion, would be of the first importance in order to land 
our Americus on the continent of America in advance 
of the Genoese-Bristol sailor. Henry Harrisse has so 
effectually disposed of the claims of the Cabots that no 
scholar to-day seriously contends for English priority 
in continental discoveries" (p. 70). 

The old story is that Cabot made his land- 
fall on June 24, 1497. The 10th and 20th of 
May are the days on which, according to dif- 
ferent texts, Vespucius sailed from Cadiz on 
the so-called Vespucian voyage of that year ; 
and when we reflect on the distance from Cadiz 
to the coast of Hondurus, we see the import- 
ance of the discrepancy in the dates. If Ves- 
pucius is to be brought to Hondurus before the 
24th of June, the ten days will be found ex- 
tremely convenient. But Mr. Thacher says 
that Mr. Harrisse has so discredited the Cabot 
voyage that no scholar now thinks of regard- 
ing it. Now what is the fact ? Mr. Harrisse's 
last word on the subject is found in his work 
entitled " John Cabot the Discoverer of North 
America, and Sebastian his Son" (London, 
1896). If the title of this work be not suffi- 
cient, then the first sentence of the preface will 
certainly answer the purpose : " In the year 
1497, a Venetian citizen called Giovanni Ca- 
boto, having obtained letters patent from Henry 
the Seventh the year previous for a voyage of 
discovery, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and, 
under the British flag, discovered the continent 
of North America." Mr. Harrisse subjects the 
Cabot documents to the most searching criticism 
and corrects many things that he holds to be 
false in the Cabot tradition. He attacks both 
the moral and professional character of Sebas- 
tian Cabot with unsparing severity. He does 
not, however, attack John Cabot, but rather 
accords to him, fully and without reservation, 
the honor of being the discoverer of North 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



113 



America. He seeks to show that Cabot made 
his landfall on the coast of Labrador, and not 
on Cape Breton Island. He contends that he 
made it earlier than June 24. Still, he holds 
expressly, not only that Cabot discovered the 
continent, but that on his two voyages, 1497 
and 1498, he sailed along its front from Cape 
Chudley in the North to Florida in the South 
(see the two maps, pp. 110-111, 140-41). 
What shall we say, then ? Mr. Thacher says 
that Mr. Harrisse has made it impossible for a 
scholar to take Cabot seriously. If this be so, 
then Mr. Harrisse has indeed discredited him- 
self, for he certainly takes Cabot seriously. It 
is therefore clear, either that Mr. Thacher is 
ignorant of Mr. Harrisse's last work on the Ca- 
bots, or that he allows his zeal, to put it mildly, 
to outrun his judgment. 

Mr. Thacher arranges in order the voyages 
to America previous to the publication of Juan 
de La Cosa's famous map of 1500. He puts 
at the head of his list, of course, the first and 
second voyages of Columbus, 1492, 1493 ; then 
comes the first so-called Vespucian voyage, 
1497 ; next the two Cabot voyages, 1497, 1498 ; 
then follow the third of Columbus, 1498, and 
the second of Vespucius, 1499. He then makes 
the following claim for his hero : 

" The first voyage of Vespucius began May 10, 1497. 
The door of the continent was thus opened by the Flor- 
entine adventurer for the first time. On this voyage 
Americus landed on the Bay of Honduras, having passed 
to the south of Cuba, thus proving to himself and La 
Cosa, the pilot of Columbus on the first two voyages, 
that it was an island; skirted the Gulf of Mexico, 
rounded Florida, and skirted the coast as far as Cape 
Hatteras in 36 of north latitude " (p. 200). 

This is a controverted matter. The question 
is not merely whether Yespucius landed on the 
coast of Hondurus a few days before Cabot 
landed on the coast of Labrador, but whether 
Vespucius visited the new world at all that year. 
The subject is involved in numerous difficulties, 
involving the genuineness, authenticity, and 
integrity of documents, and perhaps also the 
veracity of the explorer. The two foremost 
American writers who have recently dealt with 
the subject are Dr. Justin Winsor and Mr. 
John Fiske. Dr. Winsor does not allow the 
Florentine's claim. He says it is " at the best 
but an enforced method of clarifying the pub- 
lished texts concerning the voyages, in the 
hopes of finding something like consistency in 
their dates. Any commentator who undertakes 
to get at the truth must necessarily give him- 
self up to some sort of conjecture, not only as 
respects the varied inconsistencies of the nar- 



rative, but also as regards the manifold blun- 
ders of the printer of the little book which re- 
cords the voyages." And again he writes that 
it was in 1499 that Vespucius " seemingly " 
embarked for the first time to the new world, 
" since it is likely that out of this expedition 
the alleged voyage of his in 1497 has been 
made to appear by some perversion of chro- 
nology " (" Christopher Columbus," pp. 337, 
341, 373). Mr. Fiske, on the other hand, con- 
tends stoutly for the genuineness of the voyage. 
He brings Vespucius to Cape Hondurus on 
June 21, and into the Bay on the 24th. Re- 
ferring to Cabot, he says that Vespucius prob- 
ably saw the continent two or three days before 
him. " The question may have interest for 
readers fond of such trifles " (" The Discovery 
of America," Vol. II., p. 87, note). The ques- 
tion is indeed a " trifle " in itself, but when 
writers occupy themselves with it they should 
try to be accurate. Mr. Fiske is inconsistent 
with himself, for he says, in another place 
(Vol. II., p. 23) : " John Cabot was probably 
the first commander since the days of the vik- 
ings to set foot upon the continent of North 
America." Into the real merits of the case we 
cannot enter. It will be for the specialists to 
say whether Mr. Thacher has relieved a diffi- 
cult subject of any of its difficulties. He has 
certainly made a bad beginning in his misrep- 
resentation of the view of Mr. Harrisse. 

The breadth of the author's treatment can 
be readily shown. He has dealt " with the life 
of Vespucius, with an account of his voyages, 
and an attempt to establish the landfall on the 
continent of North America "; " the first voy- 
age of Vespucius, its published narration with 
the Italian, Latin, and English texts of the 
first part of the famous letter " [to Lorenzo de 
Medici] ; " the baptismal font of America, St. 
Die, the little town in the Vosges mountains 
where the new world was christened "; " the 
* Cosmographiae Introductios,' the book which 
conferred the name America, with a review of 
the four alleged editions printed at St. Die in 
1507." Then follow parts VII. and VIII., 
" Scientific Geography " and the " Charto- 
graphy of the New World." It remains only 
to add that Mr. Thacher's reproductions of 
documents and of maps, many of them in^ac 
simile, give a substantial value to his volume 
quite apart from the value of his conclusions 
as to Watling Island and the priority of the 
discovery of North America.

[Sept. 1, 



A SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHER AND AMERICAN 
COLLEGE PRESIDENT.* 



Although Professor Sloane's " Life of James 
McCosh " is chiefly autobiographical, as its 
title-page announces, the editor has shown both 
taste and skill in the admirable manner in 
which he has arranged and woven together his 
material. He writes sympathetically, but his 
praise is never extravagant, and one lays down 
the book with regret that so charming a story 
is not longer. 

Dr. McCosh's ancestors were farmers in 
southwestern Scotland, with the picturesque 
and rugged virtues made familiar to us in the 
writings of Barrie and Maclaren. He was born 
near the river Doon, in April, 1811, and he 
thought that the wild mountain scenery, the 
romantic glens, lakes, and meadows of his na- 
tive place were responsible for his intense love 
of out-door life and nature. His picture of the 
Scotch people, given in the second chapter, is 
well drawn. 

" Of all the people I have met with, the Scotch have 
the least of what we call ' manners ' in their intercourse 
with the members of their family, with their neighbors, 
and with the world generally. The Scot loves his wife 
and family, and would make any sacrifice for them, but 
he seldom or never utters a word of compliment to them. 
He doubts the sincerity of such words and acts, and is 
apt to regard them as hypocrisy, having some selfish 
end in view, and speaks of them as Frenchified and 
unworthy of an honest Scotchman. I confess I have 
often been repelled by the cool manner in which Scotch 
people, after long absences or in critical emergencies, 
often meet with each other. I remember going up to a 
most excellent man to comfort him when he was trying 
to restrain his tears as he hung over the body of his 
son, just deceased. I was chilled when all that he could 
utter was, ' This is a fine day, sir.' We can thus ac- 
count for some of the oddities of Thomas Carlyle." 

Dr. McCosh speaks of the high degree of 
intelligence among the common people of Scot- 
land, and attributes it to the work and influ- 
ence of John Knox. 

" He insisted on having a school in every parish, an 
academy in every burgh town, and a university in every 
large city. In every school the Bible was taught; in 
some districts it was the Book of Proverbs that was 
used as a text-book, and helped to give the people their 
shrewdness. This education did not and could not pro- 
duce the genius of Burns, of Scott, or Carlyle, but it 
came out in the massive sense by which they were distin- 
guished among literary people." 

He dwells upon the prevalence of the drinking 
habit at that time, to which even the minister 
was often addicted, and of immorality among 
young men and women ; remarking that "it is

traits. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



easy to see how, under these circumstances, 
young Robert Burns was so easily led astray 
by the flax-dresser of Irvine, when he went to 
live there." 

James McCosh was sent to school at the age 
of six, and was intended by his father for the 
ministry. The boy himself seems not to have 
had any very strong and impelling motive in 
this direction. He says he did not care much 
for farming, nor for mixing drugs and visiting 
the sick, nor for the law, as he " disliked wrang- 
ling." But he was always fond of books and 
of acquiring knowledge on all sorts of subjects, 
and he looked to the ministry as a means of 
gratifying these tastes. " I felt all the while 
that if I was to be a minister, I must be pious. 
Often, therefore, did I dedicate myself to God, 
praying earnestly, but not regularly or sys- 
tematically." His father died when the boy 
was nine years old, and at thirteen he was sent 
to Glasgow University. The five years spent 
there are chiefly remarkable because it was 
during this period that his taste for philosophy 
asserted itself and the ambition was formed to 
win fame in this field. He made few acquaint- 
ances at Glasgow, devoting himself exclusively 
to books, and reading with avidity everything 
that appeared from the pens of Scott, Moore, 
and Byron. In his philosophical investigations 
he took up Hume and Combe ; and it is inter- 
esting to note that it was after perusing these 
authors that this lad, not yet sixteen years old, 
formed the plan of his life work. " Thoughts 
on the Method of the Divine Government were 
already floating in his mind," his biographer 
tells us. He was also making observations that 
were to be of great use to him in his future 
relations with students and colleges. Although 
the instruction at Glasgow was not above me- 
diocrity in some respects, a great many original 
written exercises were positively required from 
each student, and Dr. McCosh was so impressed 
with the value of this literary training that he 
laid great stress on it years afterwards at Bel- 
fast and Princeton. He learned another thing 
that was helpful to him in his relations with 
young men. During his five years at Glasgow, 
although he was an able and conscientious stu- 
dent, not one of the professors ever showed 
him any attention ; and his case was not unique. 
He felt that this isolated life of the young men 
was abnormal and dangerous, and at Princeton 
it was one of his chief aims to know personally 
all the students, and to have them all feel his 
interest in them. Says his biographer : 

" The notion that a professor's duty began and ended 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

with the instruction of his class-room was abhorrent to 
him. He thought it the most serious prohlem of the 
higher education to secure the oversight and unremit- 
ting care of students, without espionage or any injudi- 
cious interference with the liberty of the young men." 

The years from 1829 to 1834 were spent at 
Edinburgh, and we are told that the magnet 
which drew him thither was the teaching of 
Dr. Thomas Chalmers, then professor of theol- 
ogy in the most famous of the Scotch universi- 
ties. Other attractions were the beautiful sur- 
roundings of the city, the numerous historic 
associations, and the fact that it was then the 
home of many eminent men, chief among them 
being the " Great Unknown," as Scott was 
called. 

"I was never introduced to him, but I could get 
quite a near view of him when he occupied his place as 
Clerk of the Court of Session. As be sat there he had 
at times little or nothing to do, and his countenance, 
though pleasant, was then somewhat heavy and dull. 
But the young barristers were proud to have a brief 
talk with him, and to hear a story from him. He was 
always willing to gratify them, and as he roused him- 
self his countenance was lighted up like the morning 
sky." 

There are also fine sketches of Francis Jeffrey, 
" Christopher North," Sir William Hamilton, 
and others. Dr. McCosh regarded Chalmers 
as, upon the whole, the greatest man he ever 
met, and expressed the opinion that he exer- 
cised a greater influence for good on his coun- 
trymen than any minister since John Knox. 
" He made the old Calvinistic creed of Scot- 
land look reasonable and philosophic, generous 
and loveable." 

The atmosphere of Edinburgh was literary 
and philosophical, and the young man had 
many advantages that Glasgow had not af- 
forded. The professors invited him to their 
homes, and on Friday evenings he had a stand- 
ing invitation to take tea with the great Chal- 
mers. His studies in philosophy were prose- 
cuted with renewed zeal, and he prepared " the 
ribs of what, in after years, when clothed in 
flesh and blood," became his work on " The 
Method of the Divine Government." The stu- 
dents had meetings, too, where they discussed 
all sorts of subjects. " But," adds this always 
thoughtful and rigidly self-examining young 
man, " some of us did not inquire into our spir- 
itual state before God as we should have done. 
Yet there were times when we did so." 

The experiences of the young minister in his 
first two pastoral charges are related with de- 
lightful freedom and simplicity, and a full ac- 
count is given of the great Disruption of the 
Church of Scotland. Dr. McCosh was one of 



the organizers of the Free Church, and he re- 
garded this as the greatest event of his life. 
Perhaps his most distinguishing characteristic 
was an absolute devotion to truth. In its ser- 
vice he was utterly unselfish, and the straight- 
forward way in which he describes his labors 
in aid of the new movement is very impressive. 

During these exciting scenes he yet found 
time to pursue his favorite studies, and in 1850 
appeared his long-dreamed-of " Method of the 
Divine Government," which attracted wide- 
spread attention, and procured for its author 
a call to the chair of Logic and Metaphysics 
in Queen's College, Belfast. He was loth, how- 
ever, to leave his ministerial office, which was 
agreeable to him, and in which he knew he was 
doing a good work ; but the opportunity to fol- 
low his natural bent, and to appeal to and im- 
press young men, was too tempting to be re- 
fused. His labors in the slums of Belfast, his 
active interest in the workingmen, his careful 
study of educational systems, and his outspoken 
sympathy with the North in our late war, show 
that his time outside of the class-room was fully 
occupied. 

Four chapters of the work are given to 
Princeton, where Dr. McCosh took the Presi- 
dent's chair in 1868. It is inspiring to read 
the account of his life and work in this univer- 
sity. In conversation with Princeton men, one 
is always struck with the tone of veneration 
and real affection in which they speak of " the 
Doctor," and after reading this book one does 
not wonder at it. It was a great work that he 
did, as president, author, teacher, leader in 
church discussions, and citizen, interested in 
all the things that make for the bettering of 
humanity. A very striking trait was his open- 
mindedness. He always turned his face to- 
ward the light, kept watch of the signs of the 
times, and was ready to take up his stakes and 
set them farther along. He had the courage 
of his convictions. He had the highest regard 
for Augustine as a great thinker, but deplored 
his " superstitions." He was unwilling to be 
classed as an Augustinian or a Calvinist, and 
freely criticised both Calvin and Jonathan Ed- 
wards. In his later life he favored a revision of 
the Westminster confession of faith, referring to

height, Dr. McCosh had the courage to defend 
the latter, and became a peacemaker by show- 
ing that it was not irreconcilable with Chris- 
tianity. 

In 1888, at the age of seventy-seven, he re- 
signed his Presidency, not because of physical 
or mental infirmities, or because he felt the 
responsibilities of his position burdensome, but 
because, says Professor Sloane, " he feared lest 
the infirmities of old age might gradually cloud 
his judgment, lest the advancement of Prince- 
ton might thus suffer a check, lest the dignity 
and influence of a long life might be impaired 
by feebleness at its close." He delivered nu- 
merous public addresses after that time, and 
during the last three years of his life jotted 
down the notes which form the basis of the 
present volume. He passed away November 
16, 1894. His was a life inwrought in the 
lives of many, " like a fine gold thread in an 
endless tapestry." That it was singularly pure 
and noble and earnest, means that these qual- 
ities were sown by him wherever he went ; for 
he influenced others to an uncommon degree. 
It is wholesome to read such a biography as 
this, and it will undoubtedly have a large cir- 
culation on both sides of the Atlantic. The 
work is beautifully executed from a mechan- 
ical point of view, and the five pictures add 
greatly to its interest and attractiveness. The 
last of the portraits, taken at the age of eighty- 
one, is the best of them all, and one turns to 
it again and again as to the face of a venerated 
father and friend.

CHILD-STUDY IN EDUCATIONAL, WORK.* 

Teaching is an art ; teachers are artists, and 
those who would enter the " profession " should 
recognize the necessity of special training for 
the work. The American public is slowly 
coming to see that education is not simply a 
formal process ; that a teacher needs something 
more than the capacity to read a text-book pre- 
scribed by an unscientific board, and to hear 
the children " recite " their lessons ; that the 
education of young children is one of the most 
important subjects that can occupy the public 
mind, that it should be in the hands of experts, 
and that it is worth paying for. It may be

true that the ideal teacher, like the poet, is 
born, not made ; but it is equally true, as Mr. 
C. D. Warner recently remarked, that industry, 
training, and the right method will do wonders 
in the education of a teacher. " Under our 
present way of running the educational machine, 
tens of thousands of ' hands ' are employed, at 
low wages, who would be much more appropri- 
ately placed if they were tending spinning- 
jennies." 

Perhaps nothing in our modern life is hav- 
ing a stronger influence in turning the work of 
school education, particularly of the younger 
children, into the hands of experts, than the 
movement for child-study ; certainly nothing 
tends so directly to strengthen the esprit de 
corps among teachers, and to raise the profes- 
sion to a dignity like that enjoyed by law, med- 
icine, and theology. On the other hand, few 
" movements " are fraught with more serious 
immediate dangers from unscientific work. It 
is primarily to meet these dangers that Profes- 
sor Sully has written his " Studies of Child- 
hood." He pleads in the preface that the book 
is not a complete treatise on child-psychology, 
but merely deals with certain aspects of chil- 
dren's minds which happen to have come under 
his notice and to have had a special interest 
for him. He nevertheless proceeds in succes- 
sive chapters to cover systematically the entire 
field of child life, from the time of the earliest 
imaginings, through the dawn of reason and 
the age of questioning, until definite products 
of child-thought are reached thoughts of na- 
ture, of self, of God, of mind, matter, and mor- 
ality. Through it all, Professor Sully is calling 
attention repeatedly to our present inaccurate 
or incomplete notions of the child's way of 
thinking of men and things its doll, the colors 
of things, number, etc.; and of the difficulty of 
acquiring the desired knowledge. The author 
confesses that, in spite of some recently pub- 
lished highly hopeful forecasts of what child- 
psychology is going to do for us, he thinks we 
are a long way off from a perfectly scientific 
account of it. Our so-called theories of chil- 
dren's mental activity have often been hasty 
generalizations from imperfect observation. 
The sentimental adoration of infant ways, 
amounting almost to baby-worship, is highly 
inimical to the carrying out of a perfectly cool 
and impartial process of scientific observation. 
Moreover, a child is very quick in spying 
whether he is observed, and as soon as he sus- 
pects that you are specially interested in his 
talk the chances are he will try to produce an

effect, and it becomes difficult to measure the 
result of the outside influence thus brought to 
bear on his mind. Similarly, it wants much 
fine judgment to say whether an infant is 
merely stumbling accidentally on an articulate 
sound, or is imitating you. Again, children 
are by no means so open to view as is often 
supposed. All kinds of shy reticences hamper 
them ; they feel unskilled in using our cum- 
brous language ; they soon find out that their 
thoughts are not as ours, but often make us 
laugh. 

For these and other similar reasons resulting 
from the nature of the observed, or of those 
who are in the best position to make observa- 
tions, the mothers, Professor Sully is in- 
clined to be somewhat pessimistic regarding the 
results of the study of child-psychology. A 
third of his book, however, is devoted to an 
effort at understanding the child's method of 
expressing his thought with tongue and pencil ; 
and nearly a hundred pages of fine print are 
given to extracts from a diary in which some 
loving father has chronicled the doings and say- 
ings of his small boy, covering a period of six 
years, the boy being, according to Mr. Sully, 
apparently a normal and satisfactory specimen 
of his class, healthy, good-natured, and given 
to that infantile way of relieving his animal 
spirits known as " crowing." That there is good 
reason for hopefulness on the part of students 
of childhood is also shown by Professor Sully's 
account of George Sand's childhood, with 
which he closes the volume. 

If anyone is disposed still to doubt the im- 
portance of a scientific study of children, he 
need but glance at the table of contents of Mr. 
Chamberlain's book on " The Child and Child- 
hood in Folk-Thought." The work is a most 
scholarly treatise, the author having searched 
all literature, and gathered from every people 
the evidences of the child's activity in primi- 
tive society, and the survival of that activity in 
the social institutions and culture-movements 
of to-day. His object is to treat of the child 
from a point of view hitherto entirely neglected, 
to exhibit what the world owes to childhood 
and to the motherhood and the fatherhood 
which it occasions, to indicate the position of 
the child in the march of civilization among 
the various races of men, and to estimate the 
influence which the child-idea and its accom- 
paniments have had upon sociology, mythology, 
religion, language ; for the touch of the child 
is upon them all, and the debt of humanity to 
the little children has not yet been told. They 



have figured in the world's history and its folk- 
lore as " magi " and " medicine-men," as priests 
and oracle-keepers, as physicians and healers, 
as teachers and judges, as saints, heroes, dis- 
coverers, and inventors, as musicians and poets, 
actors and laborers in many fields of human 
activity ; have been compared to the foolish 
and to the most wise, have been looked upon as 
fetiches and as gods, as the fit sacrifice to 
offended Heaven, and as the saviors and regen- 
erators of mankind (page 6). A chapter at 
once interesting and instructive is devoted to 
the child in each one of this curious medley of 
characters as member and builder of society, 
as judge, hero, and divinity ; the excellence of 
the matter presented being surpassed only by 
the manner in which the author has offered it 
for the use both of the advanced student and 
the general reader. The work closes with half 
a dozen chapters of proverbs from every tongue 
for the one, and a bibliography of over five hun- 
dred titles for the other ; not the least valuable 
feature of the book for either being the three 
indexes, which cover thirty pages. Child- study 
is certainly profitable and scientific if it leads 
to presenting a fund of information in such 
serviceable form.

THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT 
OF WOMEN.* 

It has been the ill-luck of women in the past 
to be credited with qualities that placed them 
on a plane apart : at one time, as by the early 
Church, they have been endowed with a sub- 
human wickedness ; at another, as by the age of 
Chivalry, they have been invested with a super- 
human virtue. St. Chrysostom pronounced 
woman to be " a necessary evil, a natural temp- 
tation, a desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a 
deadly fascination, and a painted ill." Chivalry 
arose, creating an ideal womanhood that stirred 
the imagination and the poetic fancy, and then 
raised it to a pinnacle where it was impossible 
for the actual woman to remain. Thus, both 
priest and knight did woman a great wrong. 
Whether as the " painted ill " of the Father's 
imagination, or as the immaculate star of the 
romanticist, she was equally cut off from all 
chance of development. 

Whatever the faults of the present age, it is 
under no delusions with regard to the humanity

TIMES. By Georgiana Hill. In two volumes. New York :

of woman. There are few trials, difficulties, or 
unpleasantnesses that she escapes on the score 
of sex. She is not considered incapable of 
bearing a part in the common life of the world 
on account of any ethereal qualities, nor is she 
held up before men's eyes as a temptation to be 
made war upon. In the place of mere gallantry 
on the part of men, and coquetry on the part of 
women, there is now the simpler and healthier 
relation of comradeship. 

Except in the case of the sovereigns and a 
few heads of great families, English historians 
have given little attention to the place held 
by women as factors in the life of the nation. 
Accordingly the new book on " Women in En- 
glish Life," by Miss Georgiana Hill, covers an 
almost new field. In it are depicted the chief 
causes and consequences of changes in the 
status of women, prominence being given to 
domestic life, as embracing the larger number 
and as not having been summed up in the nu- 
merous accounts of noteworthy women. 

The position of women in England cannot 
be regarded as an orderly evolution. It does 
not show unvarying progress from age to age. 
There have been breaks and gaps in the gen- 
eral advance, so that certain periods appear at 
a disadvantage in comparison with their pre- 
decessors. For example, in the old days of 
feudalism, it is evident that in the eye of the 
law women ranked on an equality with men. 
Narrow as was the view taken by legislators of 
their industrial life, and absurd as many of 
their enactments seem now, it was reserved for 
modern times to set up an artificial barrier be- 
tween the sexes, to push the working woman 
down a step, and rank her with children and 
" young persons." The ancient guilds knew no 
distinctions of sex. They were formed in the 
interest of the trading community, for purposes 
of mutual help, and were as much for the ben- 
efit of the " sisteren " as the " bretheren." The 
attitude of these early guilds toward women 
was essentially different from that of the mod- 
ern trade unions, and more liberal. In their 
ordinances relating to labor, everywhere the 
principle of equality is apparent. Not until 
later did the theory arise that women are com- 
petitors, not co-workers with men, and that it 
is better for women to be dependent upon their 
male relatives than to make their own way in 
the world a theory which still has its sup- 
porters, but is having much trouble to hold its 
own in the face of a surplus female population, 
and certain other insistent facts. 

Another curious variation in public senti- 



ment appears in regard to learning. In the 
sixteenth century, learning among women was 
held in high esteem ; in the eighteenth, it was 
counted something to be ashamed of ; in the 
nineteenth, it again finds favor. During En- 
gland's great literary renaissance of the six- 
teenth century, women stand out prominently 
among the ranks of scholars. It was not thought 
unfeminine to speak good Latin, write correct 
Greek, or translate from the Hebrew. To be 
sure, they had the advantage of having their 
attention concentrated on a few subjects. There 
was less arithmetic and history and geography 
taught than is now imparted in the district 
schoolhouse. The curriculum of a lady of rank 
did not include many things that have now be- 
come matters of common knowledge among the 
children of the working-class. On the other 
hand, the education, if narrow according to 
modern ideas, was thorough ; without the stim- 
ulus of college life, competitive examinations, 
or the prospect of rewards and honors in the 
shape of degrees, the attainments of women in 
the sixteenth century, in the subjects to which 
they had access, were of a high order ; and 
their knowledge of the classics was more inti- 
mate and exact than that produced by the 
higher education of the present day. 

After the rigorous and healthy awakening in 
the time of the Tudors, a period of reaction 
set in. The seventeenth century combined all 
the faults of all the ages laxity of morals, 
indifference to high aims, together with relig- 
ious fanaticism and a lack of appreciation of 
knowledge and learning. By that time, Shake- 
speare was considered out of date and vulgar 
by an age of fops and elegantes who could read 
Wycherley without blushing. James I., though 
a professed pedant, was adverse in every way 
to the progress of women. He treated them as 
inferiors, with ponderous levity, and nothing 
was further from his mind than the giving of 
any encouragement to the cultivation of learn- 
ing among the ladies of his court. One scholar, 
writing to the Duchess of Newcastle, speaks of 
authorship as an " inferior employment," un- 
meet for the rank and qualities of a lady like 
her Grace. 

The Puritan movement served to retard the 
intellectual advance of women. Under the sway 
of Puritanism, women were taught that all na- 
ture's gifts to mind or body were so many snares, 
and that true life consisted in crushing out all 
aims and desires not connected with the saving 
of the soul. A catch, a song, a dance, were 
looked upon as destructive of modesty, and only

fitted " for them that live in the lusts of the 
world." It was little wonder that, with learn- 
ing at a discount, and accomplishments de- 
nounced as sinful, women became frivolous and 
narrow. The light-hearted, in rebellion against 
the austerities of their Puritan neighbors, 
plunged into excesses, and the more serious 
subsided into a round of domestic drudgery. 

Far back in the days of the Lancastrians 
may be traced the progenitors of the political 
woman. They did not shrink from " memo- 
rials " and "petitions," even when these in- 
volved a good deal of publicity. Everything 
that concerned their families or the common- 
weal they felt to be within their " sphere," and 
the idea that politics was the concern of one 
sex alone had no place in their minds. That 
complex creature known as "the New Woman," 
to whom is ascribed, among other things, an 
unfeminine taste for politics, is not so modern 
after all. 

Arriving at a view of women in the Victo- 
rian Era, we are shown what English women 
have done and are doing as travellers and ex- 
plorers, in literature, art, trade, business, as 
factory hands, domestic servants, nurses, doc- 
tors, and in public and political life. Plainly, 
the Victorian age resembles the Elizabethan in 
being a time when the nation has cast its intel- 
lectual shell and become a new creature. Fam- 
ily and social life are affected as much as intel- 
lectual progress. The conception of woman's 
place in society has undergone a process of re- 
making in this century. Domestic life has so 
changed that the old role of the wife as the 
home-keeper must be modified. To spend the 
best hours of the day in* what is called " look- 
ing after the house " is an anomaly in the pres- 
ent stage of civilization. In olden times, women 
had to superintend and take part in a dozen 
operations that are now performed in factories 
and workshops, and of which the modern house- 
wife sees only the results. Many women who 
are not compelled to earn a living prefer to 
assume some daily outside occupation that en- 
ables them to keep up a more luxurious home 
and releases them from the monotony of sewing 
and household work, and gives them also some 
definite purpose and interest. The many ex- 
cellent folk who tremble lest the world shall 
suffer from the adoption by women of modes of 
life unsanctioned by tradition may be consoled 
by the reflection that Nature is stronger than 
fashion or opinion, and will at once make her 
voice heard whenever the lightest of her laws is 
transgressed. ANNA BENNESON McMAHAN. 



RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY.* 



In reviewing the poetical product of a few weeks 
or months, it is often difficult to determine what 
name should be honored with the first place among 
those that call for mention. There are so many 
minor poets who write about as well as one another 

and all upon the same dead level of mediocrity 

that to prefer one of them to his fellows seems 
invidious. Happily, no such perplexity assails us 
upon the present occasion, for the greatest name 
among all those of poets now living stands upon 
our list, and must stand in the forefront of this sur- 
vey. A somewhat larger silence than has been 
usual separates Mr. Swinburne's new volume from 
its immediate predecessor, but such gifts as he alone 
may bring us are worth waiting for, and all the 
more precious for the delay. " The Tale of Balen " 
is a long narrative poem, and, like the only other 
poem of this character to be found in the extensive 
list of Mr. Swinburne's works, has drawn for its 
material upon the rich storehouse of Arthurian 
legend. The chapters of Malory's " Morte Darthur" 
numbered 26 to 44 in the first volume of Wright's 
edition have provided the poet with both the frame-

work and the substance of his book. Unlike Ten- 
nyson, who in his supplementary idyl of " Balin and 
Balan," used the text of Malory in a merely sugges- 
tive way, Mr. Swinburne has kept close to his model, 
and in many passages gives us the words of Malory 
with only the most trifling changes. For example, 
we read in the " Morte Darthur ": 

"And Balen smote him with such a might that it 
went through his shield, and perished the hawberke, and 
so pearced through his body and the horse croupe, and 
Balin anone turned his horse fiersly, and drew out his 
sword, and wist not that he had slaine him, and then he 
saw him lye as a dead corps." 

In The Tale of Balen " this becomes : 

"But Balen 's spear through Launceor's shield 
Clove as a ploughshare cleaves the field 
And pierced the hauberk triple-steeled, 
That horse with horseman stricken reeled, 

And as a storm-breached rock falls, fell. 
And Balen turned his horse again 
And wist not yet his foe lay slain, 
And saw him dead that sought his bane 

And wrought and fared not well." 

In many passages, of course, the author gives him- 
self a freer hand than this, and paraphrase almost 
melts into original poetry. We quote once more : 
" For in that place was part of the blood of our Lord 
Jesus Christ that Joseph of Arimathy brought into this 
land; and there himselfe lay in that rich bed." 

Transmuted into the gold of Mr. Swinburne's song, 
this becomes : 

" For in that chamber's wondrous shrine 
Was part of Christ's own blood, the wine 
Shed of the true triumphal vine 
Whose growth bids earth's deep darkness shine 

As heaven's deep light through the air and sea ; 
That mystery toward our northern shore 
Arimathean Joseph bore 
For healing of our sins of yore 

That grace even there might be." 

The poet becomes strictly himself only in a few 
stanzas introductory to the several sections of the 
work. He gives us in this way a new " Song of Four 
Seasons," more beautiful, if that be possible, than 
the old. This is the stanza that sings of winter : 

" In winter, when the year burns low 
As fire wherein no firebrands glow, 
And winds dishevel as they blow 
The lovely stormy wings of snow, 

The hearts of northern men burn bright 
With joy that mocks the joy of spring 
To hear all heaven's keen clarions ring 
Music that bids the spirit sing 

And day give thanks for night." 

Enough has been quoted to illustrate the extraor- 
dinary beauty of this noble poem, as well as its tech- 
nical mastery of a difficult stanzaic form. A word 
should be said of the tragic atmosphere in which 
the work is bathed, of the solemn sense of impend- 
ing doom that deepens as we follow the fortunes of 
the fated knight, of the pity and chastened pathos 
of the tale. Mr. Swinburne has done no deeper 
work than this, and hardly any work more infused 
with sheer loveliness of conception and performance. 
It asserts once more his now indisputable title to 



the supreme place among living singers, not only 
of his own country, but of the whole world. 

There is a fine rhetoric albeit somewhat touched 
with hysteria in Mr. Watson's Armenian sonnets, 
" The Purple East "; whether there is in them poe- 
try of a high order is questionable. They are also 
very uneven ; " The Turk in Armenia," for exam- 
ple, and " England to America " are of a far finer 
inspiration than most of the others. We quote the 
former of these two : 

" What profits it, O England, to prevail 
In camp and mart and council, to bestrew 
With argosies thy oceans, and renew 
With tribute levied on each golden gale 
Thy treasuries, if thou canst hear the wail 
Of women martyred by the turbaned crew 
Whose tenderest mercy was the sword that slew, 
And left no hand to wield the purging flail ? 
We deemed of old thon held'st a charge from Him 
Who watches girdled by this seraphim, 
To smite the wronger with thy destined rod. 
Wait'st thou His sign ? Enough, the unanswered cry 
Of virgin souls for vengeance, and on high 
The gathering blackness of the frown of God ! " . 

Of course, Mr. Watson's view of the whole Ar- 
menian situation is the product of emotion unbal- 
anced by calm consideration of the facts. 

A very noble poem, " Natura Naturans," and a 
dozen shorter pieces, make up the contents of Roden 
Noel's posthumous volume. Among the minor poets 
of the recent period, Noel had a distinct place, and 
the quality of his utterance was individual, although 
his affinities with the Wordsworthian school were 
obvious enough. The friend who writes the intro- 
ductory note for this modest collection claims more 
than may reasonably be allowed for his poet in rank- 
ing him " with the greatest of his contemporaries," 
yet his analysis of Noel's delicate poetic endow- 
ment is sympathetic and helpful. In " Natura 
Naturans," he says with justice, " we find a fine 
philosophical veneration for nature (so far removed 
from a mere sensuous appreciation of her beauty) 
fully exemplified. And we may note in passing 
bow the poet does not hesitate, in this poem, and in 
many others, to touch upon much that may seem 
ironical or cruel in nature, or even to explore the 
darker shadows of life." The passage which speaks 
of the maiden driven to suicide by despair may be 
quoted in illustration of the above dictum, as well 
as of the rich quality of the poet's diction. 
" 'Mid gorgeous autumn gold she creeps to die ; 
All the deep forest burns with wondrous fires ; 
The low red sun glares like God's angry eye, 
Through black contorted boughs, whose leafy lyres 
Are muttering veiled oracles on high, 
While she flits haggard through rain-sodden mires, 
Her heart a-flame ; wild-eyed and pale she fares ; 
The branches pluck at her the while she goes ; 
Few songsters warble where the hectic flares, 
But on a wine-dark bramble the wind blows 
Some soft gray down blood-reddened ; an owl scares 
Her hooting from the hollow oak ; she knows 
That place too well ; the lake is at her feet, 
Where she and he lay lapped in heaven's bliss ! " 

A calmer and perhaps a deeper mood of the poet is 
revealed in the following verses from " Midnight ": 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



" Young Love, who leaps to life like Rhine, 
Child of the hills, reverberates morn, 
With laughter and with joy divine, 
Exulting only to be born, 
He crowned, abounding, feeds with corn 
The races, warms their hearts with wine, 
Yet the life that blest the lands 
Dies dwindled in ignoble sands." 

Noel's technique is imperfect, as the editor admits 
and these lines witness; but the subtlety of his 
thought atones in part for this defect, although not 
to the extent claimed. And it is a poor and disin- 
genuous apology to assert that " sustained perfec- 
tion " is " more often the result of artifice than art." 
Those who require " sustained perfection " in poe- 
try do not mean the perfection of artifice, and are 
not to be deceived by it. 

The next book calling for notice upon our list is 
Mr. C. W. Dalmon's " Song Favours," and we must 
quote, for its very appositeness, the lines written in 
memory of Roden Noel, and called " The Flight of 
the White Bird." 

" The golden bowl lies broken on the floor. 

The silver cord is loos'd : earthbound no more, 

Our White Bird flies out seaward from the shore. 
"Knew you the Blessed Island, fisherman ? 

Its cliffs are hung with harps ^Eolian. 

Onr White Bird seeks it at the call of Pan. 

" The silver cord is loos'd if daylight fail ? 
Our White Bird needs no guiding mast or sail ; 
He knows the secret of the nightingale. 

" His sad mates settle round the temple door 
To coo among the lilies on the floor. 
Our White Bird flies out seaward from the shore." 

This is, however, less characteristic of Mr. Dal- 
mon's work than such a song as " Parson Herrick's 
Muse," which ends thus : 

" The landlord shall our parson be ; 

The tavern door our churchyard gate ; 
And we will fill the landlord's till 
Before we fill the parson's plate ! 

" But here 's to Parson Herrick's Muse ! 

Drink to it, dear old comrades, please ! 
And, prithee, for my tombstone choose 
A verse from his Hesperides." 

Graceful fancies, embodied in tripping measures, 
with here and there a serious note by way of vari- 
ety, are the gifts chiefly brought us by this pleasant 
little book. 

In the first of his songs, " Leviore Plectro," Mr. 
Alfred Cochrane classes himself frankly among the 
minor poets, and expects that his " pensive caroll- 
ings " will, 

" Unseen of any eye, 
Disport themselves in print and die, 
Like some midsummer butterfly, 

Without his gorgeous wings." 

This is really too modest ; for the writer, although 
undoubtedly a minor poet, is a deft weaver of vers 
de societ6, and has little to fear from compari- 
son with his rivals in the field that he has chosen 
for his verses vain. Witness the close of his apos- 
trophe " To My Lady " (who has beaten him at 
croquet) : 



" In cooler blood I sympathise 

With all New Woman's aims, 
Her hansom cabs, and sailor ties, 

Her latch-key's burning claims. 
But now I doubt if she be wise 

To vanquish us at games." 

Here are a couple of pretty stanzas from " The 
Blackbird's Song ": 

" What was it that the blackbird sang, 

Who whistled in the hedge 
A jovial note that rose and rang 

Along the spinney's edge ? 
" He sang that in a sheltered spot 

That morning he had seen 
A budding snowdrop, and a knot 
Of primrose breaking green." 

We commend " The Golfer's Dream " (too long for 
quotation) to fanatics of the game. 

Mr. Nimmo Christie is also a minor poet who 
does not pretend to be anything else, and this is his 
modest confession : 

" The mad wind blows a little space, 

Then sinks into a breath and dies ; 
In meadows where its path we trace, 
And 'mid the corn, the poppies rise. 
" A little space the sunbeam falls, 

And warms and brightens ere the night ; 
And apples glow on orchard walls, 

And roses bloom where it was light. 
"So, when we pass into the dark, 

And think to leave no record here, 
Some friend unknown, perchance, may mark 

The blank, and hold our memory dear 
Some one may hear with radiant face 
The song we sang a little space." 

Mr. Christie's poems include a series of Scotch 
songs, some very acceptable sonnets, and a number 
of simple, smooth, and heartfelt lyrics. 

Mr. Charles Leonard Moore is well-known to 
students of poetry as the author of several volumes, 
the most noteworthy of which is a collection of re- 
markably powerful sonnets, a collection unsurpassed 
for poetic energy by any American writer. He now 
appears as a singer of strong-voiced " Odes," the 
best passages of which challenge comparison with 
the great writers, now with Lowell, now with Keats. 
" What fervent and funereal pipes are set 

To shape one ditty from the shifting air ? 
What notes of wild reluctance, what regret 
Sobs through the tree- trunks bare ? " 

This opening of the " Dirge for Summer " will jus- 
tify our mention of Keats, and the reference to 
Lowell derives even ampler warrant from the ode 
" To America," in which we find such verse as this : 
" Thou art the peer of Greece in those proud stories 

Where battles bear out dreams ; 
For twice, idea-urged, hast thou arisen, 

Not moved by passion or a prince's halter, 
And burst her bonds who half-time sits in prison, 

And poured thy best lives out on Freedom's altar : 
And where Fate called thee thou hast spurned fatigues, 

So ever on thy marches' westward border 
Ban a thin line of blood four hundred leagues, 

Chaos before behind a world of order : 
Dispatched such deeds : And now for what comes next 

Thou waitest in thine invulnerable West, 
Blazoning more large thy living-lettered text, 
' Chance and the tools to those who use them best.' "

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



We must make one more extract a section of Mr. 
Moore's superb " Ode of the Vision." 

" Ah see, the moon from yonder hill swings clear, 
With mellow lamp searching her crystal sphere ; 
But in our realm below 
Her ineffectual torches dimly go ; 
Landmarks effaced, all things habitual, lose 
Their surety of use ; 

The world grows foreign and all out of doors ; 
Masked revellers bear abroad the Bacchic laws : 
Not in this moon tide jungle can the Soul 
Keep its clear purposed paths to ends foreknown, 
Shadows o'ertake it and upon it roll 
Reiterate gales from magic gardens blown ; 
Tired sentinel, its fires grow dim, 
White arms are near, frank eyes dissolving swim, 
And the wine-cups o'erbrim." 

We should like also to quote from the " Idola The- 
atri," and the elegy on Poe ; but space does not 
permit. Mr. Moore, it must be confessed, is an 
uneven poet, and some of his pages are both turgid 
and obscure. But he has at his best the large utter- 
ance, the vision., and the power of harmonious ex- 
pression that characterize poetry of the higher class ; 
and our literature has cause to be proud of such 
work as may be found in this volume. 

A long silence has been broken by the publica- 
tion of " Joaquin " Miller's " Songs of the Soul," a 
volume which contains three long poems, and four 
short ones. They will not add noticeably to Mr. 
Miller's reputation, for his imagination, although it 
seems to have lost little of its glow, is as ill-regulated 
as ever, and all that he says now he seems to have 
said before in similar and better terms. Let us 
copy a stanza from " Mother Egypt ": 

" Dark-browed, she broods with weary lids 
Beside her Sphynx and Pyramids, 
With low and never-lifted head. 
If she be dead, respect the dead ; 
If she be weeping, let her weep ; 
If she be sleeping, let her sleep ; 
For lo, this woman named the stars ! 

She suckled at her tawny dugs 
Your Moses while yon reeked in wars 

And prowled your woods, nude, painted thugs." 

After a while, we learn that the poem is a plea for 
England to evacuate Egypt. Now this stanza illus- 
trates, as well as a hundred would, the strength and 
weakness of Mr. Miller's genius. In the first place, 
it is diffuse ; a truer poet would somehow have put 
the thought of the first six verses into two or three. 
All at once we are startled by the fine seventh 
verse, which almost any poet might be proud to 
own. Then comes the bald diction of the three fol- 
lowing verses, and the unspeakable incongruity of 
the closing epithet. There is hardly a page of all 
Mr. Miller's verse that would not thus exemplify 
his uncertainty of aim, his nebulosity of expression, 
his ill-chosen language, his monotony of rhythmical 
movement ; and, with all these defects, his occa- 
sional flashes of the higher sort of poetic vision. 
What a pity that he could not have imparted the 
vision alone, with the other things pruned away ! 

Two more volumes of the pretty " Oaten Stop " 



series of booklets have just been published. Mr. 
Cawein's " Undertones " reproduces the sensuous 
mood of his earlier volumes, their romantic feeling, 
their passion, and their tinge of melancholy. There 
is a fine large utterance in such a stanza as this 
from " The Wind of Spring ": 

" The wind has summoned, and I go, 
To con God's meaning in each line 
The flowers write, and, walking slow, 
God's purpose, of which song is sign, 
The wind's great, gusty hand in mine." 

" Gusty hand " is forced, and typical of the lack of 
finish that so often disappoints us in Mr. Cawein's 
work. The restraint so needed by him seems to 
have been cultivated to some purpose in this newest 
collection. Miss Kimball's " Soul and Sense " is 
simpler and less sensuous verse than Mr. Cawein's, 
with an added touch of the spirit, and a note of 
mysticism. " Contrast " illustrates the gift as well 
as the limitations of this writer. 

" Rout and defeat on every hand, 

On every hand defeat and rout ; 
Yet through the rent clouds' hurrying rack 
The stars look out. 

" Decay supreme from west to east, 

From south to north supreme decay ; 
Yet still the withered fields and hills 
Grow green with May. 

" In clod and man unending strife, 

Unending strife in man and clod ; 
Yet burning in the heart of man 
The fire of God." 

Mention of " An Oaten Pipe " may fitly follow 
our comment upon the " Oaten Stop " volumes. Mr. 
James B. Kenyon, the author, has mastered many 
of the simpler forms of verse, and his work is 
infused with genuine feeling and a true instinct for 
the beautiful in nature and life. Most of his pieces 
skim the surface of emotion in their rather airy 
flight, but of a few of them something more than 
this may justly be said. The " Sappho " sonnet is a 
favorable example of his best wor-k. 

" Where is that bay-crowned head supreme in song? 

The tides that darkle round the Leucadian steep 

Lap her forever into deeper sleep ; 
About her heart of fire the cool waves long 
Like cerements have been wound, and voices strong 

Of winds and waters o'er her pillow keep 

Their boisterous lullaby. That frenzied leap 
From the hoar height, when sense of sharpest wrong 
Ran in her blood like flame the fears that strove 

Within her stormy soul the lyric tongue 
Whose last high music rang through realms of love, 

Till hushed by that sea-weird which o'er her flung 
Its sudden doom, ah, all the dole thereof 

No equal tears have wept, no lips have sung." 

Mr. Kenyon's verse is always pleasing and in good 
taste, but we may hardly call it strong. 

The prayer of one of Edward Rowland Sill's 
most subjective and striking poems, " Lord, be 
merciful to me, a fool," has been taken by Miss 
Geraldine Meyrick for the text of the slender sheaf 
of verses that she has entitled '< Songs of a Fool." 
One of them, " Dawn," may be quoted : 



1896.]

" It will not last alway. A change will come ; 
This weary soul will fall asleep one night, 
These stamm'ring lips will some short while be dumb, 
Then wake to utter truth ; a holy light 
Will brighten these dull, foolish eyes of mine, 
And I shall stand erect, a soul divine. 

" A soul divine ! A feeble Fool no more, 

But one of God's own angels. Ah, that day 
Is long in coming ; distant is the shore 
I long so much to reach, and hard the way 
I needs must travel ; yet I will not fear ; 
A Fool, I know but this, that God is near." 

There are only a few pieces in this thin pamphlet, 
but they deserve attention for their depth of feeling 
and their sincerity. 

There are scarcely more than a dozen numbers 
in Miss Plummer's volume of " Verses," but they are 
compact with thought, and will outweigh many a 
more bulky and pretentious collection. They are 
inspired by no facile muse, and strenuous effort 
is impressed upon every page. They make their 
appeal to the intellect primarily, and their plum- 
met sinks into the deeper recesses of the soul. 
The irregular sonnet on "Old Age" is perhaps 
the finest of these pieces, and, like the verses of 
Miss Meyrick, suggests the work of Sill at its 
gravest and best. 

"Now is he come unto that countryside 

Past the last outpost. Here Life loosely reigns, 
Asking no tribute from the deadened plains 

Where stealthy mists creep from the rising tides. 

If there be fellow-travelers in this vast, 
Scarcely he knoweth. Voices that he hears 
Sound far away and strange unto his ears, 

Commingled with the echoes from the past. 

He hath outstripped the mirage of his prime 
Long since ; and journeying on to dip his hand 

Into Truth's fountain, he hath come to know 
Truth for the chiefest mirage. On the sand 

Lappeth the river at the bounds of Time. 
His dull ear listens ; must it, then, be so ? " 

The audience found by verse like this is naturally a 
small one, but it is well worth speaking to. The 
lilt of the minor lyrist pleases for the moment and 
is forgotten ; while the more serious note of such 
a poem as we have just quoted, if it succeeds in 
reaching the consciousness at all, sets up vibra- 
tions that are not for the moment only, but of last- 
ing intensity. 

Mr. Robert H. Vickers has taken advantage of 
our newly-aroused interest in Cuban and Spanish 
American affairs to write " America Liberata," a 
poem which we may describe as the epic of free- 
dom in the Latin countries of the New World. The 
whole history of the South and Central American 
republics is summarized in this production, with the 
chief stress laid upon the various wars of independ- 
ence that have been waged against Spanish mis- 
rule. Mr. Vickers is a good hater as far as Span- 
iards are concerned, and his hatred, far from being 
mere vaporing, is based upon a remarkably minute 
knowledge of Spanish American history. A speci- 
men stanza will illustrate the form of this poem. 



" Caracas' sons soon hear the longed-for sound 

And deck her streets with banners as they wait ; 

Strew verdant palms along the holy ground 
And cheer her favored son before her gate ; 

While white-robed maidens, all of spotless fame, 
Drag the triumphal car where smiles in state 

The Liberator ; high and potent name 

That yields a lordly rank his merit could not claim." 

Bolivar is the hero of this stanza, and one of the 
chief heroes of the poem. While Mr. Vickers is not 
exactly inspired in his verse, he is interesting, and 
his enthusiasm carries the reader well along with him. 
There is a certain solidity and seriousness about the 
work that place it in agreeable contrast with the 
metrical confectionery most in fashion at present. 

" The Lamp of Gold " is a sort of spiritual auto- 
biography, cast in the form of fourteen-line poems, 
seven groups of seven poems each. The confession 
is full of tenderness, resignation, and religious sen- 
timent, falling upon the ear in simple and pleasing 
measures, and affording a personal revelation that 
seems at times almost too intimate for the printed 
page. We quote one of the more objective of these 
sonnets : 

" How sweet the shadows are that softly close 

Upon the shining boundaries of the world 
Against the gonfalons of gold and rose 

Through all the sky so wondrously unfurled ! 
How fair and free the countless banners float, 

Borne onward in their royal pageantry, 
Till every hill and plain, howe'er remote, 

Thrills back the sense of some new harmony ! 
And when the glory fades amid the hush 

That deepens downward with the deepening mist, 
The dreams of men take on the morning flush 

That shimmers through the evening amethyst. 
Only the blessed child may enter in 
The kingdoms where the heavenly powers begin." 

The aim of Miss Sophie Jewett, in " The Pilgrim 
and Other Poems," has been to attempt only simple 
tasks, but to perform them perfectly. The rare dis- 
tinction of style that is found in the opening poem 
does not desert her pages as they follow one an- 
other, and there is almost nothing in the entire book 
at which the most searching criticism may cavil. 
The author relies for her effect upon no rhetorical 
devices, but upon her absolute sincerity, and her 
well-nigh faultless instinct for the right phrase and 
the appropriate rhythm. If such a sonnet as " The 
Soldier," for example, does not deserve a high place 
in American poetry, then our whole theory of the 
poetic art is wrong. 

u The soldier fought his battle silently. 

Not his the strife that stays for set of sun ; 

It seemed this warfare never might be done ; 

Through glaring day and blinding night fought he. 
There came no hand to help, no eye to see ; 

No herald's voice proclaimed the fight begun ; 

No trumpet, when the better field was won, 

Sounded abroad the soldier's victory. 
As if the struggle had been light, he went, 

Gladly, life's common road a little space ; 

Nor any knew how his heart's blood was spent ; 
Yet there were some who after testified 

They saw a glory grow upon his face ; 

And all men praised the soldier when he died."

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Dante's verse, "Non vi si pensa quanto sangue 
costa," is the fitting motto attached to this grave 
and perfect poem, which is worthy of the text. Dar- 
ing the course of this article we have twice had oc- 
casion to refer to the work of E. R. Sill. Again 
that thoughtful and harmonious singer is suggested 
by this sonnet, which also recalls Arnold in his most 
elevated ethical mood. A dozen extracts taken at 
random from this volume would not weaken but 
strengthen the impression made by this piece. One 
more may be given here, a nature-picture in which 
every word is effective. 

"The lichen rustles against my cheek, 

But the heart of the rock is still ; 
With chattering voice the cedars speak, 

Crouched gray on the barren hill. 

" A land-wind snarls on the cliff's sheer edge ; 

Below, the smitten sea 
Comes fawning over a sunken ledge 
And cowers whimperingly. 

" In the sultry wood lies a restless hush, 

Not a twitter falls from the sky ; 
Hidden are swallow, sparrow, and thrush, 
And the sea-birds only cry." 

A correction of the last line, making it read " And 
only the sea-birds cry," would leave this poem with- 
out a defect. As it is, both these verses and many 
of their fellows need but to be read to be taken at 
once to the heart. Their delicate spirituality is a 
thing to be deeply grateful for, and Miss Jewett 
need have no fear that they will fall unheeded by 
the wayside. 

" The Road to Castaly," if we follow it in Miss 
Alice Brown's footsteps, leads through many charm- 
ing woodland and mountain haunts, and the spirit 
pauses to take refreshment by the way from many 
a deep pool of emotion. A love of nature, and a 
share of the fancy that informs natural objects with 
the life that we feel to be our own, are predominant 
notes in this volume. Here is some good blank 
verse from a poem called " Sunrise on Mansfield 
Mountain ": 

"Too still for dreaming, too divine for sleep, 
So range the firs, the constant, fearless ones. 
Warders of mountain secrets, there they wait, 
Each with his cloak about him, breathless, calm, 
And yet expectant, as who knows the dawn, 
And all night thrills with memory and desire, 
Searching in what has been for what shall be : 
The marvel of the ne'er familiar day, 
Sacred investiture of life renewed, 
The chrism of dew, the coronal of flame." 

The "Stanford Rhymes" of " Carolus Ager," 
whose real name is Mr. Charles K. Field, are rather 
better than the average of college verse, and make 
a good showing brought together in a volume. They 
are alternately humorous and pathetic, with a good 
deal to say about " co-eds " and " profs " and love 
and wine. President Jordan, however, takes pains 
to inform us that " love and wine in youth are met- 
aphors only "; that the wine of these rhymes " con- 
tains no alcohol," and that the love " is not the 
serious fateful thing it seems." Whereat, we fancy, 
many a college youth will smile in wonder at the 



strange notions of the Olympians. There is a gleam 
of practical wisdom in Mr. Field's verses here and 
there, as when, for example, the senior thus gives 
advice to the freshman : 

" Study your head professor 

More than the books you buy ; 
The proper study of mankind 

Is man, you know, so try. 
Fathom his favorite hobby, 

Some hidden crank unearth, 
Whether it 's books or babies, just 

Work it for all it's worth." 

Coming back again to serious poetry, after this 
momentary interlude, we find a welcome gift in Mr. 
Clinton Scollard's " Hills of Song." 

" Lo ! I have fared and fared again 
Far up and down the ways of men, 
And found no path I strayed along 
As happy as the hills of song." 

Mr. Scollard is at his best in verse that embodies 
some historical incident or reminiscence of travel. 
Here are some " Memories of Como ": 

" Triumphant Autumn sweeps from shore to shore, 

And works swift magic with her wand of fire ; 
She fills the hollows of the hills once more 
With amethyst, and like a golden lyre 
The woodlands gleam, and quiver, and suspire. 

" I listen, and the low harmonic sound 

Quickens the happy past within my brain ; 
My spirit crosses with an ardent bound 
The severing ocean, and 1 float again 
On Como's tranquil breast that bears no stain." 

The song of " Taillefer the Trouvere," with which 
Mr. Scollard's volume opens, is a noteworthy poem 
in a fine swinging measure. 

A word concerning Mr. Archibald Lampman's 
" Lyrics of Earth," and we will end this lengthy 
review of the poetical product of the last few months. 
Mr. Lampman is one of the truest and sweetest of 
the group of Canadian poets who have made them- 
selves heard of late, and he sings of nature because 
he knows her, not because he takes it to be the lit- 
erary fashion. It is only faithful and loving ob- 
servation that can help a man to such a stanza as 
the following : 
" I see the broad rough meadow stretched away 

Into the crystal sunshine, wastes of sod, 
Acres of withered vervain, purple-gray, 
Branches of aster, groves of goldenrod ; 
And yonder, toward the sunlit summit, strewn 
With shadowy boulders, crowned and swathed with weed, 
Stand ranks of silken thistle, blown to seed, 
Long silver fleeces shining like the noon." 

Mr. Lampman's verse combines this fidelity to the 
facts of nature with high qualities of imagination 
and passion ; it will both bear and repay a close 
examination. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE.

Memoirs of Mr ' Fulton's " Memoirs of Freder- 

Dr. Barnard, ick A. P. Barnard" (Macmillan) 
of Columbia. trace the career of a man whose chief- 
est labors were spent in educational reform. In the 
main they show the man in his public capacity, 
where he seems to have possessed very great intel- 
lectual energy, and to have been as unfaltering as 
he was uncompromising in the pursuit of prin- 
ciple ; but in the first three chapters we get an idea 
of his remarkable personality. Dr. Barnard, when 
nearly eighty years of age, still remembered and 
described with vididness the early associations of his 
childhood, the village school, with its plank benches 
of unpainted pine, the old meeting house, with its 
high-backed pews, its great pulpit, and the long ser- 
mon in which he took as little interest as did the or- 
dinary boy of the time. Although he enjoyed what 
were then considered good educational advantages, 
and won much distinction as a scholar at both Stock- 
bridge Academy and Yale College, he spoke depre- 
ciatingly of them in later life. His course at Yale, 
he said, was a process of self-education. Like many 
another student, he found that the best part of his 
education began after he received his bachelor's de- 
gree. Graduating from Yale in 1828, Mr. Barnard 
began his pedagogical career as an assistant in the 
Hartford Grammar School. He then became a tu- 
tor in mathematics in Yale College ; but at the end 
of a year his increasing deafness forced him back 
to Hartford, where he accepted an instructorship in 
the American Institute for the Deaf and Dumb. 
He entered so earnestly into this work at Hartford, 
and later at New York, that he soon became a mas- 
ter in the principles and practice of deaf-mute 
instruction. From 1838 to 1854 he was connected 
with the University of Alabama, where his skill as 
a teacher and organizer was a potent influence in 
bringing order out of the disorganized state into 
which that institution had been brought by the insub- 
ordination of its students. It was here that he 
wrote those important letters on College Govern- 
ment which centred upon him the attention of the 
prominent educators of the country. He next went 
to Mississippi, where his reputation as an educator 
and his power as an executive soon secured for him 
the Presidency of the State University. He now 
inaugurated many important reforms, some of which 
were just reaching their consummation when the out- 
break of the Civil War brought to a sudden close 
these, as well as other, enterprises of peace. Al- 
though Dr. Barnard, in his long residence at the 
South, had become a slaveholder, he at no time 
wavered in his opposition to secession. In 1864 he 
was elected to the Presidency of Columbia College, 
and from that time until his death, in 1889, his life 
is the history of the important educational matters 
connected with that institution. As much of Mr. 
Fulton's book is devoted to the exposition of Dr. 
Barnard's opinions, the work is certain of a kind 
reception from all interested in higher education. 



Mr. Roy Devereux's " The Ascent of 
Woman " (Roberts) is a clever little 
book wherein members of the " ruder 
sex," as some innovating spirit impolitely styles it, 
may find themselves and their current interests pun- 
gently and thoughtfully discussed. Since Schopen- 
hauer dismissed her with the curt definition, 
" Women are grown-up children," woman has de- 
veloped capacities and advanced claims undreamed 
of in his philosophy. The worm (if we may ven- 
ture on the expression here) has turned ; the once 
bond are free ; the chrysalis has become the winged 
Psyche and, in fine, the poor-spirited creature of 
the primitive Hausfrau type contemplated by the 
German philosopher shows as a mere protoplasmic 
polyp, or mollusc, when compared with her highly 
evolved successor of to-day. It is the woman of 
to-day, rather than woman in the abstract, that our 
author discusses ; and he discusses her shrewdly, 
critically, sympathetically, and even comprehen- 
sively, in so far, at least, as a theme so complex can 
be viewed comprehensively by a single intellect. It 
is fair to Mr. Devereux to say that he does not pre- 
tend to explain woman. Perhaps a genius may 
arise some day who will achieve this, and then turn 
his attention to the Hegelian philosophy. The intro- 
ductory chapter deals with " The Criticism of Wo- 
man," after which the author goes on to discuss, 
under the main heads " Of her Life " and " Of her 
Looks," such topics as : " The Value of Love," " The 
Practice of Marriage," "The Sisterhood of Wo- 
man," " The Progress of Fashion," " On Color in 
Costume," " The Superfluous," " The Ideal," etc. 
The author's style savors of sound reading, his ideas 
are usually fresh and worth weighing, and his book 
altogether forms a refreshing contrast to the aver- 
age dissertation on its subject. If the " new woman " 
be half she claims to be, and what her judicious 
friends would fain believe her to be, it is surely 
high time to write of her and for her as if she were 
something more than Schopenhauer's " grown-up 
child," something more than the trifler whose mind 
is formed on the study of the " Society Column " 
and the contemplation of the " fashion plate." 
Every woman of sense and spirit must resent the 
assumption, still common on the part of publishers 
of the hundred-and-one more or less trashy and inane 
journals gotten up for the express use and delecta- 
tion of her sex, that only the mildest sort of literary 
pap is congenial to the female palate and digestion. 
Mr. Devereux pays his fair readers the compliment 
of assuming at the outset that their latter-day inter- 
est in serious things is not all a sham and fad of the 
hour. 

Most readers of Browning will be

attitude toward Christianity ; or, 
more accurately speaking, of Browning's presenta-

larly fitted for the task, by the knowledge of the 
poet's works, and the appreciation, shown in pre-

vious books. Dr. Berdoe himself gives further 
reason in an introductory note : Browning has been 
to him a real apostle, whose work has been of the 
greatest success. " Browning and the Christian 
Faith " (Macmillan) comes, then, with good spon- 
sors : we think the volume will not be found to fall 
short of expectation. It is, as is indicated on the 
title-page, a systematized view of " the evidences of 
Christianity from Browning's point of view." We 
should not think of offering particular criticism 
upon such a book in the space at our command ; it 
must be sufficient to indicate the plan of the work 
and the success of the author in carrying out his 
plan. With regard to any such study, there would 
seem to be two questions which must be answered 
before we can estimate its value. First, can we be 
sure, in dealing with so dramatic a poet as Brown- 
ing, that we have his own opinion in this or that 
quotation? and, second, can we rightly make a 
system based upon quotations from the work of fifty 
years, without considering the chronology of the 
matter ? In other words, do we want a system of truth 
expressed in Browning's words, or a statement of 
Browning's own religious beliefs ? We do not think 
that Dr. Berdoe is quite definite on these points. 
As to dramatic utterance, he points out that he seeks 
Browning's own opinions : we think that although 
here and there he mistakes the sayings of the char- 
acter for the beliefs of the writer, he is generally 
in the right. But as to the second question, he has 
nothing to say. His quotations come from all parts 
of Browning's works, and he leaves us in this 
dilemma : either Browning never held this system 
in its entirety, or there was no development in his 
religious thought for half a century. Possibly this 
objection is that of the literary historian, who always 
desires to know what was the actual fact; many 
lovers of Browning will desire, rather, to know what 
was Browning's testimony through life to a system 
of universal truth. 

In the " Life, Letters, and Journal 
of Maria Mitchell" (Lee & Shepard) 
we get a view of one of the ablest 
women and most interesting characters of the present 
generation. Showing a decided taste for astronomy 
at a period when there was no school in the world 
where she could be taught either this or the higher 
mathematics, when even Harvard College had no 
better telescope than the home instrument belonging 
to Mr. Mitchell, when astronomy was regarded as 
akin to alchemy, the contributions of Miss Mitchell 
to astronomical science are fully entitled to be con- 
sidered independent, if not original. Her services 
as an educator are scarcely less distinguished. Her 
method was through stimulus and not through drill ; 
she held the marking system in contempt, but hun- 
dreds of Vassar alumnae and students testify to her 
immense force on their lives. Her influence upon 
the pupils who were her daily companions was per- 
manent, character-moulding, and unceasingly pro- 
gressive. Her study in the observatory of Vassar 



College, surrounded by the evidences of her honor- 
able professional career, came to be regarded by 
many as a pilgrim-shrine of life, and her personality 
was so strong that it gave astronomy a prominence 
at Vassar such as it has had in few colleges either 
for men or women. The narrative of this life is 
told with reserve and dignity, but with sufficient 
fulness, by a sister, Mrs. Phebe Mitchell Kendall. 

Mr. H. S. Salt, who is known as an 

Thoreau as a j, ,. .. mi t i 

Great Writer. editor of a portion of Thoreau s col- 
lected works, and as a writer about 
Thoreau from a very appreciative and even eulo- 
gistic point of view, has given, in his life of Tho- 
reau for Mr. Walter Scott's series of " Great Writ- 
ers " ( imported by Scribner ) an abridged and 
revised edition of his earlier work, published in 
1890. In the case of Thoreau there is less material 
for a biography than in that of almost any other 
figure in literature. His was neither a life of the 
family, nor of the community, nor of the nation, 
nor even of the republic of letters ; it had no events, 
no career ; there was only the set inwardness of 
growth of a life hid with nature. So, the very little 
material the biographer finds must be made much 
of, even in so small a work as this. Still, this is a 
sufficiently readable and accurate account. The 
three last chapters discuss Thoreau as man and 
writer. Mr. Salt regards him as most akin to Rich- 
ard Jefferies ; but he is certainly wide of the mark 
in supposing that Thoreau could have written the 
sentence quoted on page 189. Thoreau never " fan- 
cied " anything ; his method of expression was ab- 
solutely direct. Mr. Salt thinks the future will 
rank Thoreau as " no mere Emersonian disciple," 
but as a " master-mind," " by far the most inspired, 
stimulating, and vital personality of all the Concord 
group." - 

To consider the Anglo-Saxon para- 



. 

Caedmon as a separate and original 
epic, and read it in comparison with Milton, is to 
commit one's self to appreciative, rather than scho- 
lastic and elucidative, endeavor. This is chiefly 
what the Rev. S. Humphreys Gurteen, in his " Epic 
of the Fall of Man : A Comparative Study of Caed- 
mon, Dante, and Milton" (Putnam), has, as he 
avows himself, attempted. Dante is brought in only 
for the chapter on the torture-house of the Anglo- 
Saxon version and the hell of " Paradise Lost," and 
the Caedmonian poem is treated frankly as the homo- 
geneous product of the bard of Whitby ; so that a 
perusal of the book resolves itself into a purely 
aesthetic weighing of the Old-English work with the 
performance of the great Puritan. Here, since 
" Paradise Lost " is notoriously the most artificial 
poem in the language, it is not hard to agree with 
Mr. Gurteen in finding many places where Caedmon 
is the more freshly pleasing. The conception of 
Eve, notably and perhaps not unaccountably, is a 
case in point. Probably one of the results of the 
Anglo-Saxon revival in this century is destined to be 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

a still more frequent turning back to the undulled 
pages of Old-English literature. Mr. Gurteen uses 
his own careful translation of the paraphrase, and 
the volume further embodies reduced facsimiles of 
the curious and interesting illuminations of the Jun- 
ian manuscript, taken from the facsimiles originally 
published by the London Society of Antiquaries. 

A reference book Mr - F - J - Stimson assures us that his 
for labor laws in " Hand-Book to the Labor Law of 
the United states. the United States " (Scribner) is 
the result of an attempt to set forth, as it exists in 
the United States to-day, that law of labor disputes 
and the regulation of industrial affairs and the pro- 
tection of employees, which has had its greatest de- 
velopment in the last few years." There is no 
attempt at exhaustive treatment, and the volume is 
not even dignified with the claim of being a law 
text-book. It is intended for general use, and has 
the undoubted merit of dealing with a thoroughly 
live public question in a most interesting and intelli- 
gent manner. Just now there are perhaps no ques- 
tions of more vital concern to the vast army of 
wage-earners than those which are considered in this 
hand-book. The chapter on strikes, boycotts, and 
lockouts is one of the fullest, both in its statement 
of the law as it is found on the statute-books of the 
various States and of the views of courts upon the 
various phases of the labor question, which have 
been brought before them for adjudication. The 
comments of the author are generally fair, and his 
judgments seem to be sustained by the better rea- 
son. The citation of cases is numerous enough to 
fulfil the purpose of the book, and the copious foot- 
notes add to its value. The book well supplies a 
need with that class who do not care for an exhaus- 
tive or very technical treatment of the subject. 

Readers who think they have got 
True realism gome notion of warfare from an emo- 
tional and illiterate book like " The 
Red Badge of Courage " may be commended to 
such a work as Colonel Edward Anderson's " Camp 
Fire Stories " (Star Publishing Co.) as a corrective. 
Colonel Anderson served as a cavalry officer in the 
Southwest during the greater part of our Civil War, 
and had his full share of the soldier's experience. 
A clergyman before and after, the fighting instinct 
was too strong to be resisted during those four event- 
ful years, and he fought Southerners in the field as 
vigorously as he had been wont to fight Satan in 
the pulpit. The stories that he tells us are not so 
much of battles, however, as of the incidental phases 
of army life ; they are in turn pathetic and shrewdly 
humorous, and give us many glimpses of the day- 
by-day life of camp, bivouac, and hospital. They are, 
moreover, happily mellowed in the retrospect of 
riper years, infused with the kindliest feeling, and far 
more effective in their unpretentious way than many 
a more ambitious portrayal of army life. The au- 
thor expresses a hope that his book " may make 
many an eye that grows rheumy with age flash out 



again the old fires of years ago, and many a young 
face light up with a new-born patriotism," and we 
do not doubt that it will produce both the one effect 

and the other. 

Mr. W. G. Wood-Martin presents a 
Antiquities of summary of the knowledge concern- 

Pagan Ireland. , . J . . . -,-, /-,, . . 

ing the antiquities oi Pre-Christian 
Ireland, in a work entitled " Pagan Ireland, an 
Archaeological Sketch" (Longmans). There are 
few richer fields for the student in archaeology. The 
field has been diligently worked, but the results are 
to be found only by a prodigious ransacking of jour- 
nals, transactions, and proceedings, not easily ac- 
cessible. Our author is an authority ; both as field- 
worker and writer, he is well-known ; his studies 
of Irish Lake Dwellings and Rude Stone Mon- 
ments are classic. He is, then, eminently qualified 
for the task he undertakes in this book. He has 
accomplished it well. The whole field is traversed, 
and the six hundred pages of close print, with more 
than four hundred illustrations, make the work what 
the author claims a handbook of Irish Pre- 
Christian Antiquities. There is an excellent index, 
and a classified bibliography of six hundred and 
more numbers, some of which comprise several ref- 
erences. The general reader will find the book 
interesting ; the archaeologist will find it indispens- 
able. The portions dealing with " traces of the 
elder faiths," superstitions connected with stones, 
and the use of stones in divination and cursing, will 
particularly please most readers. 

History of ^ r< F> ^' Habben devotes an inter- 

street names esting little book of some 260 pages 

m London. j o investigating the origin, meaning, 

and historic value of " London Street Names " 
(Lippincott). Visitors to London have time out of 
mind been used to puzzle over such seeming freaks 
of municipal nomenclature as " Petticoat Lane," 
"Pudding Lane," "Mincing Lane," " Bull-and- 
Mouth St.," " Camomile St.," " St. Margaret Pat- 
tens," and so on ; and these mysteries Mr. Habben 
elucidates briefly and for the most part conclusively. 
Much of London history is epitomized in these 
quaint names of old streets and courts, which have 
endured like monumenta cere perenniora of a buried 
past ; and therefore the author has in some cases 
not hesitated to be rather discursive. Usually, how- 
ever, the names are dismissed with a brief state- 
ment of their origin. The reader will find the book 
a useful supplement to the excellent works on Lon- 
don of Mr. Lof tie and Sir Walter Besant. 



The English 
Cathedrals. 



Mrs. Julia C. R. Dorr is one of the 
latest travellers to write a book about 
the English cathedrals, which, though 
they may be less perfect than their fellows across 
the channel, are demonstrably perennial in their 
charm. "A Cathedral Pilgrimage" (Macmillan) 
gives an account, in readable woman's English, of 
visits to Wells, Salisbury, Ely, Peterborough, Lin- 
coln, Durham, Canterbury, and Exeter. There is 



128 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



a bit of historiography now and then, some of the 
anecdote of travel, and some frank, if rather ex- 
alted, impression. The papers, which are partic- 
ularly designed to bring to " true cathedral lovers " 
at home " the delight of personal knowledge and 
intimacy," make also a volume which will take little 
room, and probably not come amiss, in the tourist's 
knapsack. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Lorenzo de' Medici is the subject of the last volume 
introduced, somewhat equivocally perhaps, into the 
" Heroes of the Nations " series (Putnam), of which 
some seventeen have already appeared under the gen- 
eral editorship of Mr. Evelyn Abbott. The book may 
be thought to derive a kind of fanciful timeliness since 
the discovery last year of the bodies of the great despot 
and his brother in the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo in 
Florence. Lorenzo's latest biographer, Mr. E. Arm- 
strong, does not pretend to be definitive, and many per- 
sons may find his interpretation a bit ideal, yet the ques- 
tions in dispute are for the most part freshly and sanely 
put. 

" A Text-Book of the History of Architecture " 
(Longmans), by Mr. A. D. F. Hainlin, and "A History 
of Architecture for the Student, Craftsman, and Ama- 
teur" (imported by Scribner), by Mr. Banister Fletcher 
and Mr. Banister F. Fletcher, are single-volume treat- 
ises for the student and the general reader. Both are 
abundantly illustrated, but the work of the Messrs. 
Fletcher has the more attractive plates, and is the more 
extensive treatise of the two. 

" Macaulay's and Carlyle's Essays on Samuel John- 
son," edited by Mr. William Strunk, Jr., are published 
in a neat volume by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. Other 
English texts are Macaulay's essay on Milton (Ginn), 
edited by Mr. H. A. Smith ; a volume of " Selections 
from Carlyle" (Allyn), edited by Mr. H. W. Boynton; 
Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" (American Book Co); 
and an annotated selection of Tennyson's " Idylls " 
(Houghton), made by Professor W. J. Rolfe. 

Messrs. John Murphy & Co. issue a little booklet 
entitled " How to Speak Latin, a Series of Latin Dia- 
logues with English Translation." The book is by Mr. 
Stephen W. Wilby, and is divided into four depart- 
ments: Forms of Speaking, Dialogues, Readings, and 
Wisdom of the Ages, the last being a collection of more 
or less familiar Latin aphorisms. 

" The Oxford Manuals of English History " (Scrib- 
ner) are designed to provide students with elementary 
text-books dealing with special periods in the spirit of 
the most recent scholarship, yet affording, when taken 
together, a resume of the entire history of England. 
The books are to be six in number, under the editorship 
of Mr. C. W. C. Oman, and three of them have been 
received by us. " The Making of the English Nation," 
by Mr. C. G. Robertson; " King and Baronage," by Mr. 
W. H. Hutton; and "King and Parliament," by Mr. 
G. H. Wakeling, are the titles. These volumes are one, 
two, and five, of the projected series, leaving " The 
Hundred Years' War," "England and the Reforma- 
tion," and " The Making of the British Empire " yet to 
be supplied. The work appears to be very well done, 
is uniform in scale and method, and may be warmly 
recommended to teachers of English history. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Briimmer's " Lexicon of German Authors " contains 
about five thousand names. 

It is stated that the Norwegian government has re- 
cently done away with the study of Latin and Greek in 
the higher schools of that country. 

Herr Bjornson announces that he will hereafter live 
in Germany, having been driven from his native country 
by the constant attacks upon him by the political press. 

Dr. Newton Bateman and Mr. Paul Selby are en- 
gaged in the preparation of a " Historical Encyclopedia 
of Illinois," which promises to be an interesting and 
valuable work. 

Dr. Charles Lotin Hildreth died in New York a few 
days ago, from nervous prostration brought on by the 
terrific heat of August. He was forty years of age, and 
will be remembered as the author of " The Masque of 
Death, and Other Poems," a volume of considerable 
value. 

Mr. J. E. C. Bodley, an English scholar, has been at 
work for the past six years upon a book which will do 
for modern France about what Mr. Bryce has done for 
the United States in his " American Commonwealth." 
The first volume will be published this fall by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. announce a new edition, 
in three volumes, of Mrs. Lamb's " History of the City 
of New York," with a lengthy additional chapter on 
" The Externals of the Modern City," prepared by Mrs. 
Burton Harrison. Those having the old editions of 
Mrs. Lamb's work may obtain Mrs. Harrison's edition in 
a volume by itself. 

Professor Josiah D wight Whitney, of Harvard Uni- 
versity, died on the nineteenth of August, at the age of 
seventy-six. He was an elder brother of the late W. D. 
Whitney, and the highest mountain in the United States 
bears his name, a deserved tribute to his high rank as a 
geologist. His name is associated with that of the late 
Dr. J. W. Foster, of Chicago, in the well-known Foster 
and Whitney's Report on the Geology of the Lake Su- 
perior Region. 

We learn that work has actually begun on the impor- 
tant enterprise of reprinting, in French and English, 
the extended series of " Jesuit Relations," projected by 
Messrs. Burrows Brothers of Cleveland. Sixty volumes 
of three hundred pages each, and five years of time, will 
be required; the volumes appearing at the rate of one 
a month. The work is all to be done in Cleveland, at 
the Imperial Press; and the type is to be set by ma- 
chinery. Mr. R. G. Thwaites is the editor of the series. 

We find the following interesting note in the " Japan 
Mail," the leading English-printed journal of Japan: 
" We understand that the chair of English Literature in 
the Imperial University is to be filled by Mr. Lafcadio 
Hearn; Professor Wood, its hitherto occupant, being 
about to return to the United States. The University 
is very fortunate in obtaining the services of a literary 
star like Mr. Hearn. Our readers may not be aware 
that Mr. Hearn is a naturalized Japanese, and that, in 
the country of his adoption, he is known as Mr. Iwai- 
zumi Yakumo. It will, perhaps, be referred to by and 
by as a singular fact that whereas the chair of Japanese 
Literature in the University was, until recently, filled 
by a British subject, Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain, the 
chair of English Literature is now to be occupied by a 
Japanese subject."

Mrs. Goodwin's Romances of 
Colonial Virginia. 



WHITE APRONS. 

A Romance of Bacon's Rebellion, Virginia, 1676. 

By MAUD WILDER GOODWIN, author of " The 

Colonial Cavalier," etc. 16mo, cloth extra, gilt 

top, $1.25. (Just Ready.) 

The scene of Mrs. Goodwin's new story is in part 
Virginia, and in part the Court of Charles the Second. 
The historical basis of the romance is the episode known 
as " Bacon's Rebellion," in the time of Governor Berke- 
ley, but the author has woven into it a charming love- 
story and given the whole narrative much dramatic 
interest. 

" One of the best romances of the season." Phila- 
delphia Public Ledger. 

" It is no less a success as a literary monument than 
as a piece of most entertaining fiction. Its love notes 
are pure and sweet, and withal inspiring. Almost any 
scene picked out at random is a quotable instance of 
genuine ability." Boston Herald. 

" A charming story. ... Its fidelity to the condi- 
tions prevailing in the Virginia Colony at the time is 
carefully sustained." The Review of Reviews. 

" Mrs. Goodwin invests her romance with a crispness 
and freshness that set it far above the ordinary novel, 
wherein facts and fiction are thrown together." The 
Chicago Evening Post. 

" As sweet and pure a bit of fiction as often comes 
in the reader's way." Detroit Free Press. 

" A beautiful little story sweet and inspiring, not 
less clever than true." New York Times.

ence to the recommendations of the National 
Committee of Ten, and is designed for pupils 
beginning Geometry at the age of twelve or 
even younger. It is based upon the author's 
class-room experience with young boys, and is 
an attempt to supply a work in Geometry 
adapted to grammar grades.

(Second Edition nearly ready.) 

" We wish to call most particular attention to a collection of short 
Western stories by Mrs. Feattie, entitled ' A Mountain Woman.' The 
book contains several of the best tales of Western life ever written. 
The Nebraska stories throw so true a light upon recent conditions in

are advocating free silver." Review of Reviews.

" The papers outside the descriptive and the critical are little ser-

the title ; they are not preachments ; they are of the sermon's right 
length, of about as long to read as the passage of a cathedral chant in

leave a sense of stilled singing on the mind they fill. . . . Lessons in

VASARI'S LIVES OF THE PAINTERS. Lives of Seventy of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculp- 
tors, and Architects. By GIORGIO VASARI. Edited and Annotated in the Light of Recent Discoveries by E. H. 
and E. W. BLASHFIELD and A. A. HOPKINS. With Reproductions of 48 Masterpieces of Italian Painting and Sculpture. 
Limited to 500 numbered copies for America. 4 vols. Large 8vo, $15.00 net. (Ready shortly.) 
Vasari's classic work has long called for systematic editing in English. Documents of all kinds have been discovered, new canvasses and 

frescoes found, and old ones brought to light. The present editors have for two years been engaged in preparing the present edition, which 

must long remain the definitive English edition of this great work. 

HISTORY OF THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY IN THE UNITED STATES, 1870-1895. By E. 

BENJAMIN ANDREWS, President of Brown University. With 350 Illustrations. 2 vols. 8vo, $6.00. (Beady shortly.) 
President Andrews' work is absolutely unique. Never before have the many history making events of this period been gathered together 

in a historical narrative by a competent hand. Since its publication in SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE the History has been thoroughly revised and 

increased in size almost one-half, thus making it possible to include many topics omitted before. 

IN OLE VIRGINIA. By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. With 24 full-page Illustrations by A. B. FROST, HOWARD PYLE, 
W. T. SMEDLEY, C. S. REINHART, A. CASTAIGNE, and B. WEST CLINEDINST. 12mo, $2.50. (Beady shortly.) 
This handsome volume contains Mr. Page's famous stories of Southern life " Marse Chan," " Meh Lady," " Polly," " Unc' Edinburg," 

"Old Stracted," and "No Haid Pawn." The illustrations are as notable for the exquisitely sympathetic manner in which they reflect the 

spirit of the text, as for their charming artistic qualities. It is an ideal holiday gift-book. 

MY VILLAGE. An Artist's Sketches of French Rural Life. By E. BOYD SMITH. With nearly 150 Illus- 
trations from Original Drawings by the Author. 12mo, $2.50. 

Mr. Smith spent many years in the village he calls Valombre, and lived there the life of the peasants themselves. He describes most 
charmingly with pen and pencil the many picturesque types of character that abound, the fetes, occupations and diversions, and daily incidents, 
the varied round of comedy and tragedy that make up the peasant's calendar, enlivening his sketches with touches of quaint humor. 

AN ILLUSTRATED FLORA. Of the Northern United States, Canada, and the British Possessions from Newfound- 
land to the parallel of the southern boundary of Virginia, and from the Atlantic Ocean westward to the 102d meridian. 
By N. L. BRITTON, Emeritus Professor of Botany, Columbia University, and Hon. ADDISON BROWN, President of 
the Torrey Botany Club. Three Volumes, 8vo, Vol. I., special net, $3.00, postage 36 cents extra. 
This work is the first complete Illustrated Flora published in this country. Its aim is to illustrate and describe every species, 4000 in 

number, from the ferns upward. The first volume, now ready, is entitled " Ferns to Carpet-Weed." 

THE SPRIGHTLY ROMANCE OF MARSAC. By MOLLY ELLIOTT SEAWELL. "New York Herald" Prize 

Story. Illustrated by GUSTAVE VERBEEK. 12mo, $1.25. 

Marsac is a real discovery of Miss Sea well's. His character and conduct are best described as "sprightly," and the way in which the 
wit and good nature of this Bohemian of the Latin Quarter triumph over adverse circumstances and land him and his friend in affluence and 
bliss is told in a brisk narrative that recalls Miirger. The illustrations are numerous, and as original as the text. 

THE EDGE OF THE ORIENT. By ROBERT HOWARD RUSSELL. With 130 Illustrations. 12mo, $2.00. 

Mr. Russell here presents the account of an interesting trip along the picturesque coast of Dalmatia and Montenegro, an unfamiliar field of 
travel, and continuing through Constantinople and the Eastern coast of Asia Minor to Cairo and the Nile. 

FRANCE UNDER LOUIS XIV. (Le Grand Siecle.) Translated from the French of EMILE BOURGEOIS. With 22 
Photogravures and 500 other Illustrations. Large 8vo, beautifully bound, $15.00. (Beady shortly.) 
An altogether notable work, based upon the writings of Voltaire, Saint Simon, Madame de Se'vigne', La Bruyere, the Princess Palatine, 

etc., etc. It is distinguished alike for the historical value of its contents, the interest and charm of its style, and for the richness and pro- 

fuseness of its illustrative material, which has been drawn from every source, public and private. 

ON THE TRAIL OF DON QUIXOTE. By AUGUST F. JACCACI. With 130 Illustrations by DANIEL VIERGE. 

12rao. (In press.) 

This volume is in a sense the outgrowth of a long friendship between the artist, who was born and bred a Spaniard, and the author, who 
is familiar from boyhood and from recent travel with the province of La Mancka. The book is not an attempt to follow Don Quixote's wan- 
derings in detail, but its plan is to describe Don Quixote's country as it is to-day, with incidental allusions to such scenes as are acknowledged 
and easily recognizable. The abundant illustrations are the finest work of the famous artist. 

SENTIMENTAL TOMMY. The Story of His Boyhood. By JAMES M. BARRIE. Illustrated by WILLIAM 

HATHERELL. 12mo, $1.50. (Beady October 17.) 

" Sentimental Tommy " has been undoubtedly the success of the year during its serial publication. It has been the one serial talked of, 
and, as more than one critic has said, to be " eagerly waited for. ' ' Mr. Barrie has made Tommy one of the most delightful characters in fiction ; 
he has produced a book which, not to speak of its genius, is one of the most entertaining of the time. 

MARGARET OGILVY. By JAMES M. BARRIE. 12mo. (In press.) 

An affectionate sketch of the life and character of a mother by her son, which is necessarily also a sketch of much of his own life and 
surroundings, as well as his work, in its manner a sort of true " Window in Thrums."

BRIEFS FOR DEBATE 
On Current Political, Economic, and Social

Edited by W. Du Bois BROOKINGS, A.B., of the Har- 
vard Law School, and RALPH CURTIS RINGWALT,

ALBERT BUSHNELL HART, Ph.D., of Harvard Uni- 
versity. Crown 8vo, with full index^ pp. xlvii.-213. 

[Immediately. 

In preparing this volume the editors have had a threefold object in 
view. They have aimed : (1) to furnish a text-book for formal courses 
in public speaking and discussion ; (2) to provide a manual for literary 
and debating societies ; and (3) to give the ordinary worker, not a spe- 
cialist in the subjects treated, suggestion and assistance. It states con- 
cisely the principal arguments, pro and con, on a large number of the 
important topics of the day ; presents working bibliographies on these 
topics ; gives example of logical statement, and may suggest a sys- 
tematic method for the treatment of other topics. EXTRACT FROM 
PREFACE.

" Miss Follett takes up a special line of technical political study, 
seemingly exhausting all the material that is to be had in connection 
with it, and giving us a book complete, well rounded, exact, painstak- 
ing in every detail, laborious in historical research, judicial hi method, 
and independent in motive. ... An admirable work." Commercial 
Advertiser (New York).

DR. ROBERT CHAMBERS'S 
LIFE AND WORKS OF ROBERT BURNS. 

Revised and partially Re-written by WILLIAM WAL- 
LACE, M.A., author of " Scotland Yesterday," etc. 
Illustrated with Etchings and Photogravures from 
Original Drawings by C. Martin Hardie, R.S.A.; 
W. D. Mackay, R.S.A.; R. B. Nisbet, A.R.S.A.; 
G. O. Reid, A.R.S.A.; and G. Pirie; a new photogra- 
vure of Nasmyth's Portrait; and an Engraving of 
Beugo's Portrait. In 4 vols. Crown 8vo, $2.50 each. 
V* This is an entirely new edition of Dr. Chambers's standard and 
authoritative work on Robert Burns. When the "Life and Works of 
Robert Burns " appeared in 1851, the four volumes were at once recog- 
nized as bringing order out of chaos, as placing the poet's career in a 
true light, and as establishing the text on a sound basis. In spite of 
the voluminous literature on Burns that has since appeared, Dr. Cham- 
bers's work has not been deposed from its place of authority. Mr. 
Leslie Stephen, speaking of the lives of Burns in the " Dictionary of 
National Biography," says, "Chambers's contains the only thorough 
investigation of facts."

"The pictures which Lady Lindsay presents to her reader are clean 
and true in tone, the emotions which she expresses are sincerely and 
sympathetically portrayed. She has made a step forward in her art, 
and has made it with real success ; and to do this is far more desirable 
than to repeat an old achievement, with all the certainty of triumph." 
Mr. ARTHUR WAUGH in the London Daily Courier.

" I believe that this is the first time that any attempt has been made 
to study the marking of animals in detail, with the view of reaching what 
seems to be the real, or at all events the proximate, cause of their exist- 
ence. Mr. Tylor and Mr. Poulton, Dr. Wallace and Mr. Darwin have 
studied the coloration of animals ; but, as far as I am aware, no attempt 
has been hitherto made to account for certain markings which occur, as 
one might say, in a sort of plan, and in so many different animals. In 
these pages I have made an attempt to account, not only for their deriva- 
tion, but also for their genesis, as far as this can be known. " EXTBACT

Portraits and Paintings, 15 colored Maps and Plates, 
and 280 Text Cuts and Maps. 2 vols., 8vo. 
Large-Paper Edition, limited to 250 copies. 2 vols., 
large 8vo. 

To supplement Mr. Fiske's masterly account of the causes

entrance into authorship, and gives glimpses or full views of 

Longfellow, Whittier, Dr. Holmes, Mr. Fields, Mrs. Stowe,

others. 

THORNTON K. LOTHROP. 

William H. Seward. 

In the American Statesmen Series. 16mo, gilt top, $1.25. 
As Governor of New York, United States Senator, and 
Secretary of State, Mr. Seward was obliged to deal with ques- 
tions of great importance and of serious practical difficulty 
and he brought to these the grasp of a true statesman as well

story of his career and achievements with generous apprecia- 
tion. 

WILLIAM T. HARRIS. 

The Spiritual Sense of Dante's Divina 
Commedia. 

New Edition. 12mo, $1.25. 

As the work of such a scholar and thinker as Dr. Harris, 
this book, which embodies long and thorough study of Dante, 
commends itself primarily to all students of Dante, and hardly 
less to all serious-minded readers. 

WILLIAM BELLAMY. 

A Second Century of Charades. 

18mo, $1.00. 

Mr. Bellamy's former book has fairly established itself as 
a classic in its peculiar department. The new hundred Char- 
ades are of the same unique character as the former thought- 
ful, ingenious, brilliant, delightfully puzzling, and very satis- 
factory when guessed. 

KATE DOUGLAS WIGQIN and 
NORA ARCHIBALD SMITH. 

Kindergarten Principles and Practice. 

16mo, $1.00. 

This completes the series which will be known as The He- 
public of Childhood. The first volume is " Froebel's Gifts," 
the second, "Froebel's Occupations." The three form a 
remarkably full and clear handbook for the kindergartner, 
and are hardly less valuable and helpful to the mother of 
young children.

THE SONNET. 

The sonnet is Life's cup : the spirit's leap, 
And passionate cravings in the flesh that dwell; 
Glad hope of heaven, or despair of hell; 

The unavailing tears that lovers weep , 

In hopeless separation; dreamless sleep 

Deaf to earth's maddening discords; passion's swell, 
Ambition's futile empire, death's wild knell, 

All, all are mingled in this chalice deep. 

The sonnet is Law's pledge : a draught divine 
Expressed from all that's vital in man's clay; 

Life's frenzies here, tempered to issues fine, 
Compassions foster, pangs of heart allay; 

And thralls of impulse, drunken with this wine, 
Find truer freedom subject to art's sway. 

MELVILLE B. ANDERSON. 



BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON. 

The announcements of forthcoming books, 
collected by us from the publishing houses of 
the United States, and classified for reference 
and comparison in the present issue of THE 
DIAL, indicate that the production of literature 
is not seriously interfered with by the business 
depression of the country. The returns show 
an increase in the activities that cooperate in 
the making of books, and it would seem that 
whatever region or locality is the modern and 
American equivalent of Grub Street is in 
greater danger of over-population than it has 
been in the past. Following our established 
custom at this season of the year, we not only 
publish what is practically a full list of the an- 
nouncements thus far made, but select also for 
the convenience of the hurried reader.what seem 
to be the most important of the many hundreds 
of titles given under the several categories. 

In the department of History, one undertak- 
ing is so large that all the others are dwarfed 
by comparison. We refer of course to the sixty- 
volume edition of the " Jesuit Relations," un- 
der the direction of Mr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, 
of which monthly volumes are promised to 
begin at an early date. " A Political History 
of England," by Mr. Goldwin Smith ; " The 
Rise and Growth of the English Nation," by 
Mr. W. H. S. Aubrey ; and the second volume 
of the " Constitutional History of the United 
States," by George Ticknor Curtis, are among 
the most important remaining announcements. 
We also note four new volumes in the useful 
series called " Periods of European History "; 
the slapdash magazine " History of the Last 
Quarter Century in the United States," by 
President E. B. Andrews ; " Europe in the 
Middle Ages," by Messrs. Thatcher and Schwill, 
of the University of Chicago ; the " Journals " 
of Alexander Henry of the Northwest Com- 
pany, edited by Dr. Elliott Coues ; a " History 
of the Army of the United States," by General 
T. F. Rodenbough and Major W. L. Haskin ; 
" The Puritan in England and New England," 
by Dr. E. H. Byington ; a " History of the 
German Struggle for Liberty," by Mr. Poult- 
ney Bigelow ; a "History of the Columbian 
Exposition," edited by Mr. Rossiter Johnson ; 
" The Story of the Mine," by Mr. C. H. Shinn ; 



142 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



and translations of Eire's " Diary of a Citizen 
of Paris during the Terror," and of the impor- 
tant work of Dr. Crestos Tsountas on " The 
Mycenaean Age." 

The biographical list includes several num- 
bers that will be eagerly awaited ; as, for ex- 
ample, Mr. Andrew Lang's life of J. G. Lock- 
hart ; the autobiography and memoir (the latter 
by his widow) of Philip Gilbert Hamerton ; 
and the autobiography of Mrs. Mary Cowden 
Clarke. Other biographies that are sure to be 
found interesting are Mr. Woodrow Wilson's 
George Washington, Mrs. Lynn Linton's " My 
Literary Life," Miss Harriet Monroe's John 
Wellborn Koot, Mr. T. K. Lothrop's W. H. 
Seward, and Mrs. Lathrop's memories of her 
father, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Two studies of 
Walt Whitman, one by Mr. John Burroughs 
and the other by Mr. Thomas Donaldson, will 
find their special circle of readers. Interesting 
also will be " The Brontes and their Circle," 
edited by Mr. Clement Shorter and Dr. W. 
Robertson Nicoll, and " The Story of My Life," 
by Mr. Augustus J. C. Hare. 

The long-promised letters of Victor Hugo, 
edited by M. Paul Meurice, will appear soon 
in an English translation, and will add an 
important document to French literary history. 
Among other very important works in the de- 
partment of literary history and criticism, we 
have to chronicle the extensive study of Shake- 
speare, by Dr. Georg Brandes ; an eight- 
volume series of " Periods of European Litera- 
ture," edited by Mr. Saintsbury ; and the third 
volume of the " History of English Literature," 
by the late Professor ten Brink. The follow- 
ing titles also catch the eye and the imagina- 
tion of the student of literature : " Mere Liter- 
ature and Other Essays," by Mr. Woodrow 
Wilson ; " Talks about Autographs," by Mr. 
George Birkbeck Hill ; " Victorian Influ- 
ences," by Mr. Frederick Harrison ; " The 
Bible in Old English Writers," by Dr. Albert 
S. Cook ; " Impressions and Experiences," by 
Mr. W. D. Howells ; " Aspects of Fiction," by 
Mr. Brander Matthews ; " The Relation of 
Literature to Life," by Mr. Charles Dudley 
Warner ; " The Literary Movement in France 
during the Nineteenth Century," by M. Georges 
Pellissier ; " Essays on Books and Culture," by 
Mr. H. W. Mabie ; " Modern French Litera- 
ture," by Mr. Benjamin W. Wells ; and " The 
Literature of Music," by Mr. J. E. Matthew. 

Poetry, new and old, offers several attractive 
announcements. Of new poetry, for example, 
we shall have " The Seven Seas," by Mr. Hud- 



yard Kipling ; " Judith and Holofernes," by 
Mr. T. B. Aldrich ; and a third volume of the 
poems of Emily Dickinson. Among new edi- 
tions of the older poets none will be, perhaps, 
more welcome than Miss Guiney's edition of 
Henry Vaughan, which we know beforehand 
will be a work of the fullest love and sympathy. 
Mr. Mosher announces eight new reprints, 
including Rossetti's translation of " La Vita 
Nuova," " Ballads and Lyrics of Old France," 
by Mr. Andrew Lang ; and a book of lyrics 
from Mr. William Morris. Mr. J. Churton 
Collins has prepared " A New Anthology " of 
poems " chosen from the minor and less familiar 
English poets." There will be a " Cambridge " 
edition of Lowell in one volume ; an edition of 
Burns, prepared by Mr. Lang ; and a complete 
Browning, in two volumes, edited by Mr. Au- 
gustine Birrell. 

In fiction, the most interesting announcement 
is probably that of " Quo Vadis," by Mr. Sien- 
kiewicz. It is hardly too much to say that this 
Polish novelist is the greatest figure that has 
appeared in European literature during the 
past decade. A few of the more promising 
titles in this department are Mrs. Ward's " Sir 
George Tressady," Mr. Crawford's " Taqui- 
sara," Mr. Henry James's " The Other House " 
and " The Spoils of Poynton," Mr. Bret Harte's 
"A Convert of the Mission," Dr. Conan Doyle's 
" Rodney Stone," Mr. Chambers's " The 
Maker of Moons," Mr. Pemberton's " A Puri- 
tan's Wife," Sir Walter Besant's "The City 
of Refuge," and Mrs. Craigie's "The Herb 
Moon." Among new editions, we find such 
noteworthy enterprises as the " Riverside " 
Harriet Beecher Stowe, in sixteen volumes ; 
" The Writings of Bret Harte," in fourteen 
volumes ; twenty-eight more volumes of Mr. 
Saintsbury's edition of Balzac ; a six- volume 
edition of Lane's " Arabian Nights," a dozen 
more volumes of Captain Marryat in their 
beautiful new garb ; and an edition de luxe, in 
thirty-four volumes, of the " Complete Works 
of George Meredith," reedited by their author. 

The literature of travel and description has 
assumed unusually large proportions during the 
past few years, and the new books promised 
indicate a continuous demand for new informa- 
tion about the round world and its peoples. 
We note as of especial interest, " The Near 
East," by Mr. Henry Norman ; " In the South 
Seas," by Robert Louis Stevenson ; " Sketches 
from the United States of North America," 
from the Russian of Mr. A. P. Tverskoy ; 
" Impressions of South Africa," by Mr. James 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



143 



Bryce ; " Stray Thoughts on South Africa," 
by Mrs. Schreiner ; " Travel and Talk," by the 
Eev. H. R. Haweis ; "Through Unknown Afri- 
can Countries," by Mr. A. Donaldson Smith ; 
" Among the Neighbors of the North Pole," 
by the lamented Eivind Astrup ; "An Eclipse 
Party in Africa," by Mr. E. J. Loomis ; " Lazy 
Tours in Spain and Elsewhere," by Mrs. Lou- 
ise Chandler Moulton ; and " The Land of the 
Castanet," by Mr. H. C. Chatfield-Taylor. 

From the other departments of book produc- 
tion, important as they are, we have space to 
glean but a few prominent examples. A mag- 
nificent edition of Botticelli's drawings for 
the " Inferno " is in course of preparation. 
Two other large undertakings are " A System 
of Medicine," in seven volumes, edited by Mr. 
T. C. Allbutt ; and " Harper's Dictionary of 
Classical Literature and Antiquities," edited 
by Mr. H. T. Peck. We must also mention 
the fact that a new edition of Mr. Bartlett's 
Shakespeare Concordance is offered at about 
half the price of the earlier one. A few more 
attractive titles are these : " The Music of the 
Modern World," edited by Mr. Anton Seidl 
and Miss Fanny M. Smith ; " Problems of 
Modern Democracy," by Mr. E. L. Godkin ; 
*' Governments and Parties of Continental Eu- 
rope," by Mr. A. Lawrence Lowell ; " Econom- 
ics, being the History of Ideas in Economics"; 
by Mr. H. D. Macleod ; " Habit and Instinct," 
by Professor Lloyd Morgan ; " Letters to the 
Clergy on the Lord's Prayer and the Church," 
by Mr. John Ruskin ; " The Old Testament 
and Modern Life," by the Rev. Stopford A. 
Brooke ; " Christianity and Patriotism," by 
Count Tolstoy ; and the important series en- 
titled " Philosophy in its National Develop- 
ments," of which the first volumes will be " Phil- 
osophy of India," by Professor Max Miiller, 
" Philosophy of America," by Professor John 
Dewey ; and " Philosophy of Buddhism," by 
Professor Rhys Davids and Mrs. Davids. Of 
books prepared especially for the holiday season 
we make no mention at present, partly because 
the lists are as yet very incomplete, and partly 
because our limits forbid. Enough has been 
said to indicate that the " general reader," and 
even the specialist in most directions, will find 
it quite as hard as ever, if not even harder, to 
keep abreast of the current of new thought and 
new literary expression during the coming year. 
The list of forthcoming books, viewed as a whole, 
is not only considerably larger than any we have 
heretofore published, but seems also a richer 
and weightier one than any of its predecessors. 



THE LATEST CRITIC OF DEMOCRACY.* 

The familiar name of the English historian 
Lecky awakens eager expectations and quick- 
ens curiosity. His previous studies of past pe- 
riods, as he himself modestly suggests, " brings 
with it kinds of knowledge and methods of rea- 
soning that may be of some use in the discussion 
of contemporary questions." The main pur- 
pose of his latest work is to show the growth 
of modern democracy and its effects upon lib- 
erty of thought and action, and upon character. 
The merely negative word " liberty " does not 
really express the scope of the field traversed, 
and the writer shows that it is the influence of 
popular government on life, morality, culture, 
and happiness, which he has in mind. His 
standpoint is avowedly and manifestly that of 
one who believes in liberalism and individual- 
ism, and whose class sympathies are with the 
heirs of wealth and culture. He sees with 
absolute clearness that political power has 
passed finally and irrevocably into the hands of 
a majority whose capacity is not yet fully known, 
and that the descendants of the former ruling 
classes must struggle for a hearing and a place. 
He sees that this newly acquired possession of 
political power gives the control of army, navy, 
taxing machinery, legislation, administration, 
judiciary, and the organs of instruction, to those 
who have thus far been deprived of a dominant 
place in the government under which they live. 
He thinks that this new majority is and must 
long remain, for the most part, ignorant and 
coarse, and that their government must place 
liberty and culture in constant peril. He says : 

" One of the great divisions of politics in our day is 
coming to be whether, at the last resort, the world should 
he governed by its ignorance or by its intelligence. 
According to one party, the preponderating power should 
be with education and property. According to the other, 
the ultimate source of power, the supreme right of ap- 
peal and of control, belongs legitimately to the majority 
of the nation told by the head, or, in other words, to 
the poorest, the most ignorant, the most incapable, who 
are necessarily the most numerous." 

But does it follow, a democrat may reply, 
that it is so necessary that the majority must 
be without property and without intelligence? 
According to his own showing, later in the 
work, the working classes have made immense 
advance in securing property and intelligence. 
Horace Mann did not regard it necessary to

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



act on the assumption that the majority should 
be ignorant. Pestalozzi selected wayward chil- 
dren for the test of his pedagogic philosophy. 
Abraham Lincoln appealed to a rude audience, 
but no statesman ever appealed to nobler senti- 
ments when he addressed the lords and bishops 
or the dons of Oxford. It is strange that so 
learned and liberal a man should not see that 
the very illiteracy which alarms him is a pro- 
duct of the malfeasance in office of the classes 
he praises ; not a product of nature, but of un- 
holy neglect on the part of the privileged nobility 
and clergy. They who possessed the national 
wealth failed to educate the nation's children, 
and now despise them for being ignorant. 

Partial as these main contentions are, there 
is much which democrats may well ponder. An 
easy optimism may expect large harvest with- 
out fertilization, tillage, and seeding. If democ- 
racy fails now it will be the fault of its leaders, 
and these leaders may learn more of their ene- 
mies than of their friends. 

The book before us can hardly be called 
inductive in method. It is more like a polit- 
ical argument. From the start there is a posi- 
tion to be maintained, a thesis to be proved. 
The past reign of aristocracy is praised, its 
virtues are exalted, its services estimated at 
their highest value, its sins and follies either 
passed over in silence or gently extenuated. 
Democracy is hunted down in all modern lands 
and searched for flaw and weakness ; its faults 
of passion and inexperience, of raw youth and 
impetuous revolt, are exposed to the most pow- 
erful light, and made to appear in their most 
frightful forms. But even these exaggerations 
have a basis in history, and are untrue only 
because the facts are drawn out of proportion. 
Even a photograph will magnify the nearer 
objects beyond their relative right. 

Democracy and liberty are two large words, 
and they invite us into almost every field of 
current interest. Our guide is one of the most 
accomplished and instructed of his age. A 
great and industrious author has ransacked the 
history of the century for his materials. Of 
the simple direct style, it is needless to speak ; 
it is so good that you never think about it, but 
only of the subject in hand. 

The book begins with an account of English 
representative government in the eighteenth 
century. One can see the author looking back 
over his shoulder with regret at the stately 
forms of nobles who fade ghostlike on the 
threshhold of our century. If only we could 
bring back the day that is dead, and awake the 



voice that is still, how happy we might be ! 
Each great interest was represented by people 
who had " a stake in the country," and the 
rabble had no organ of speech. But Kousseau's 
doctrine of equal manhood suffrage was revolu- 
tionary. Modern politicians must pander to a 
less gentlemanly constituency, and it is only nat- 
ural that they should fall into sycophancy and 
employ bribery ; that they should use the taxing 
power to purchase the favor of ignorant and im- 
poverished voters at the cost of men of wealth. 

French and American life furnish illustra- 
tions of the defects of popular rule. We are 
nowhere reminded of the story told by Mr. 
D. B. Eaton about the fight for civil service 
reform in Great Britain ; nor are we told that 
the same great democratic movement which 
gave hope to the multitude brought a higher 
purity to the servants of the crown. Our " Molly 
Maguires," our spoils system, our lax natural- 
ization customs, and our municipal corruption, 
are held up for deserved castigation, and are 
treated as natural fruits of democracy. 

Turning to the effects of the extended fran- 
chise upon Great Britain, the author tells the 
painful story of the Irish Land Question, and 
of the attacks on property recommended by 
Henry George ; calls attention to the growth of 
taxation in all modern countries ; excites dread 
of the financial burden of popular education ; 
and objects to the tendency to throw all taxation 
upon one class. And a remedy for all this abuse 
of popular power ? More of the same kind 
in its most democratic form, the Referendum. 
He is pleased with the Referendum because it 
seems to wear out the patience of the multitude 
and make them tired of going to the polls. 

A valuable chapter is devoted to Upper 
Chambers in various legislatures. Mr. Lecky 
admits that the spectacle of a yawning bench 
of noble lords dawdling over the affairs of an 
empire is not altogether edifying. He sug- 
gests measures which may render that body 
more truly representative of the higher classes 
and of conservative influences. 

The effects of democracy on the liberty of 
the world are to be traced in the changes of 
feelings about nationality and international 
relations. Great peoples have discerned that 
secession cannot be tolerated. The United 
States was compelled to maintain national unity 
by a war of coercion. Italy could never defend 
itself from foreign aggression so long as the 
states were separate. 

Religious liberty has been extended with 
democracy, and " the religious sentiment has

not decayed, and it is certainly not less genuine 
because it is no longer fortified by privilege, or 
connected with interested and hypocritical as- 
sents." The universities have^ppened their 
doors to Dissenters. But, the author holds, the 
restraint of anti-social conduct which wears a 
mask of religion is always justifiable. The 
suttee was rightly abolished in India, and poly- 
gamy made a crime in Utah. When democracy 
does conclude to use repression it is less will- 
ing to compromise than is a monarchy or an 
aristocracy, and there is a tendency to regulate 
conduct in all directions. The working classes, 
now risen to power, are indifferent to dogma. 
Religion promotes social welfare, and is less 
busy with distinctions of creed or ritual. 

Mr. Lecky is not altogether pessimistic. 
English character, in spite of democracy, has 
improved. Philanthropy has diminished the 
chief sources of crime. There has been a 
marked improvement in the decorum and hu- 
manity of the bulk of the poor. The skilled 
artisans have become " not only the most ener- 
getic, but also one of the most intelligent and 
orderly elements, in English life." Some good 
things are said even of America ; of our cour- 
age in war, our generosity to the vanquished, 
our payment of the national debt, and much of 
our penal and civil legislation. The private 
character of our citizens must not be judged by 
the state of our municipal governments. 

It was impossible to avoid a discussion of the 
influence of the Catholic Church on democracy. 
To Englishmen the Irish priests are objects of 
keenest interest. The Catholic clergy have 
come to be a class apart from the best elements 
of society. Skepticism has detached the most 
intelligent layman, the " chief moderating and 
restraining influence in the church, and it has 
thrown the direction of that great organization 
more and more into the hands of priests and 
fanatics." Mr. Lecky recommends two laws : 
one to make " the introduction of politics into 
chapels, and the actual or threatened depriva- 
tion of religious rites on account of a political 
vote, a criminal offense punishable by severe 
penalties "; the other " a law putting an end 
to all personal interference or participation of 
priests at elections, except as simple voters." 
Mr. Lecky charges the priests with employing 
the confessional and the pulpit as agencies of 
political control, and declares that they are 
guilty of numerous acts of complicity with 
crime. In general, the author thinks, clerical 
influence over politics has diminished. Full 
religious liberty, civil marriage, national educa- 



tion, have advanced everywhere, even in coun : 
tries under papal influence. 

The tendency of democracy to meddle and 
regulate is illustrated by the modern Sjun,day 
laws, restrictions upon gambling an$ drinking 
habits, and the statutes on marriage and di- 
vorce. He places a high value ..on a compul- 
sory rest day, but criticizes the tendency to sup- 
press wholesome Sunday recreations. " Those 
have, indeed, much to answe.r for who have for 
generations deprived the, ( poor of all means of 
innocent recreation and mental improvement 
on their only holiday." 

Democracy and Socialism are closely con- 
nected. A brief, sketch of Utopias introduces 
an account of the rmo^ern socialistic theories 
and movements. ,The economic analysis and 

i . *. v ->ii t , i > / 

criticism do not satisfy the special student. 

I .* bfcv i I > i J. - . 

The conclusion reached is : " The sense of right 
and wrong ; the feeling x of family affection ; 
the essential difference of men in aptitudes, 
capacities, and character, are things that can 
never be changed, and all schemes and policies 
that ignore them are doomed to ultimate fail- 
ure." The treatment of the question of usury 
in the canon law ignores the recent work of the 
German students and of Professor Ashley. In 
touching the history of charities, the great work 
of Ratzinger is not mentioned. Apparently Mr. 
Lecky is more familiar with, French than he is 
with German writers. A very readable account 
is given of modern factory legislation, trades 
unions, and patronage. Mr. GUman's work and 
argument on profit-sharing, and, Mr. Schloss's 
criticism, are not noticed. One of the most valu- 
able chapters is that which treats of the industrial 
and political movements on behalf of women. 
A gleam of light relieves the later pages, and 
a way out of the perils of democracy is indi- 
cated. " The great hope of our industrial future 
is that the working classes will master these 
principles, and abstain from seeking, proximate 
benefits at the cost pf ultimate disaster." The 
dangers of a corrupt and ostentatious plutoc- 
racy are faithfully depicted. " Merrie En- 
gland " furnishes an expressive quotation : 
" Jay Gould, the ' financier,' got more * pay ' 
and held more wealth than Gladstone, and Car- 
lyle, and Darwin, and Koch, and Galileo, and 
Columbus, and Cromwell, and Caxton, and 
Stephenson, and Washington, and Raphael, 
and Mozart, and Shakespeare, and Socrates, 
and Jesus Christ ever got amongst them." A 
diet of plain living and high thinking is rec- 
ommended as one remedy for social injustice.

THE WARFARE OF SCIENCE.* 

The nervous system of the animal kingdom 
is primarily a device for making locomotion 
safe. The mind, using the word in the broadest 
sense, is the function of the nervous system. 
The reflex action of the ganglion is the type of 
all mind processes. Through the sensory nerves, 
impressions of the external world are received 
by the brain or central ganglion. The brain 
has no source of knowledge other than this. 
All human knowledge comes through human 
experience. The function of the brain is, sit- 
ting in darkness, to convert sensory impres- 
sions into impulses of action. To this end are 
developed the motor nerves which pass from 
the brain and other ganglia outward to the 
muscles. The sensory organs are the brain's 
sole teachers, the muscles are its sole servants. 
The essence of the intellect, as distinguished 
from reflex or instinctive action, is the prep- 
aration for motor responses to external stim- 
ulus. As the conditions of life grow more 
complicated, the possible ways in which sen- 
sation may go over into action grow more nu- 
merous. It is the function of the intellect to 
consider these, and of the will to choose. The 
condition of safety in life is to choose the 
right response. Wrong choice leads to failure 
and death. 

From this, by the process of natural selec- 
tion, comes the intense practicality of the senses. 
They tell us the truth as to external things, in 
so far as this truth has been necessary to the 
right action of our ancestors. Those of our 
predecessors who did not " see things as they 
really are," to the degree that their life pro- 
cesses demanded, have died leaving no descend- 
ants. Our own ancestors, through all the 
generations, have been creatures of adequate 
sensations. Were it not so, they would have 
been inadequate to cope with their environment. 
In other words, the sensations their brains 
translated into action were truthful enough to 
make action safe. That our ordinary sensa- 
tions and our deductions from them are truth- 
ful so far as they go, is shown by the safety 
found in trusting them. This is shown also by 
the instruments of precision which are the tools 
of science. That instruments of precision like- 
wise tell the truth, is shown by the fact that 
we can trust our lives to them. That they are 

* A HISTORY OF THE WARFARE OF SCIENCE WITH THE- 
OLOGY IN CHRISTENDOM. By Andrew Dickson White, LL.D.

more trustworthy than the unaided senses, is 
shown by their greater safety. 

But while our senses tell the truth as to 
familiar things, as rocks and trees, foods and 
shelter, friends and enemies, they do not tell 
the whole truth. They go only as far as safety 
in life has compelled them to go. Chemical 
composition they do not show. Objects too 
small to be handled are too small to be seen. 
Bodies too distant to be reached are never cor- 
rectly apprehended. Accuracy of sense grows 
less as the square of the distance increases ; and 
sun and stars, clouds and sky, are in fact very 
different from what they seem. 

Other mental processes arise to produce con- 
fusion. Memory pictures readily blend them- 
selves with realities. The nervous system of 
the one individual is readily affected by the 
conditions existing in another. Men are gre- 
garious creatures, and their speech gives them 
the power to add to their own ideas and expe- 
riences the ideas and experiences of others. 
Thus, many actions are based, not on our own 
sensations, but on the sensations of others. 
Readiness of suggestion and the instinct of con- 
ventionality are elements of great importance 
in insuring the safety of gregarious creatures. 
Thousands of men are saved daily through con- 
ventionality. These leave descendants with like 
instincts and impulses. 

With all this, the growth of each individual 
must be determined by his own experience. 
" My mind to me a kingdom is." About the 
sense impressions formed in my own brain, I 
must build up my own universe. Thus it comes 
that each accretion of human knowledge must 
be thrown into terms of our previous experi- 
ence. Stated in these terms, it is always imper- 
fectly stated. By processes of suggestion and 
conventionality, the ideas of the individual 
become assimilated to those of the multitude. 
Thus tradition and myths arise to account for 
phenomena not clearly related to the ordinary 
experiences of life. 

It has been evident to man in all ages that 
there lie about him forces stronger than he, 
invisible and intangible, inscrutable as to their 
real nature, but none the less potent to bring 
about results. He cannot easily trace cause 
and effect in dealing with these forces, and it 
is natural that he should doubt the existence of 
causality in the phenomena they produce. All 
races of men capable of continued thought have 
come to believe in the existence of something 
outside themselves, whose power is without hu- 
man limitations. Through the imagination of 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



147 



great poets, these forces become personified. 
Anthropomorphism is inevitable, because each 
man, in his thought, must bring all forces to 
his own measure. Into his own universe all 
that he knows must come. 

It is perfectly safe, in the ordinary affairs of 
life, to believe in gods and fates, imps and 
elves, norns and demons. It is quite as con- 
sistent with ordinary virtue and effectiveness to 
believe in these as it is to have the vague faith 
in microbes and molecules, mahatmas and pro- 
toplasm, which form part of the mental outfit 
of the man of our day. Unless these ideas are 
brought to " the measure of a man," they can- 
not be wrought into human action. If they 
are so brought, they diverge very widely from 
the actual facts in nature which they represent. 

Recognition of the hidden but gigantic forces 
in nature leads men to fear them or to worship 
them. To think of them, either in fear or wor- 
ship, is to give them human forms. To grant 
them the form of man is to give them " a local 
habitation and a name," and in every age and 
in every race men have been chosen and set 
apart as representatives of these forces. In 
every nation there are men who are commis- 
sioned to speak in the name of each god that 
is worshipped or each demon that the people 
dread. 

The existence of each cult of priests is bound 
up in the perpetuation of the mysteries and 
traditions they visibly represent. These tradi- 
tions are associated with other traditions of 
other powers, with other conventional explana- 
tions of uncomprehended phenomena. While 
human theories of the earth, the stars and the 
clouds, of earthquakes, storms, comets, and 
disease, have no direct relation to the feeling of 
worship, yet of necessity they become entangled 
with it. History shows that the human mind 
cannot separate one set of traditional preju- 
dices from another. 

We come to attach sacredness to the ideas 
acquired in our youth, whether derived from 
our own experience or the teachings of our 
fathers. Against this feeling, new ideas, what- 
ever the nature of their source, must struggle 
for acceptance. Much that we call our religion 
to-day is simply the debris of our grandfathers' 
science. To this debris we cling with special 
persistence. We would save the little that is 
left of the mental universe we built around us 
in our youth. 

It is the work of science to find the real na- 
ture of the universe. Its function is to elim- 
inate, as far as may be, the human equation in 



every statement. By methods of precision of 
thought and instruments of precision of obser- 
vation it seeks to make our knowledge of the 
small, the distant, the invisible, the mysterious, 
as accurate as our knowledge of the common 
things with which man has dealt for ages. It 
seeks to make our knowledge of common things 
accurate and precise, that this accuracy and 
precision may be translated into action. For 
the ultimate end of science, as well as its ini- 
tial impulse, is the regulation of human con- 
duct. Seeing true means thinking right. Right 
thinking means right action. To bring about 
right action is the end of science. Greater pre- 
cision of thought and action makes higher civi- 
lization possible. Lack of precision in action is 
the great cause of human misery, for misery is 
Nature's protest against the results of wrong 
conduct. The message of science to man is 
expressed in Huxley's words : " There can be 
no alleviation of the woes of mankind except in 
absolute veracity of thought and action and the 
absolute facing of the world as it is." " The 
world as it is " is the province of science. As 
the " world as it is," to the sane man, is glori- 
ous, beautiful, noble, and divine, so will science 
be the inspiration of art, poetry, and religion. 

The intellectual growth of man has been one 
long struggle between the ideas of the universe 
derived directly from realities and the ideas 
derived from tradition and suggestion. The 
record of this struggle is the most valuable part 
of history. It is the culmination of evolution. 
In his notable record of this struggle, Dr. John 
W. Draper has called it " The Conflict between 
Science and Religion." But the inadequacy of 
this definition has been generally recognized. 
Any feeling, condition, or aspiration, worthy 
the name of religion, must be individual and 
not collective. Religion can have no such 
interest in such a struggle, other than this : the 
triumph of truth breaks the shackles of the 
individual mind. In free minds religion finds 
her natural abode. 

President White calls it " the struggle be- 
tween Science and Dogmatic Theology, . . . 
the conflict between two epochs in the evolu- 
tion of human thought the theological and 
the scientific." This idea was years ago crys- 
tallized by him in these memorable words : 

" In all modern history, interference with science in 
the supposed interest of religion, no matter how con- 
scientious such interference may have been, has resulted 
in the direst evils both to religion and to science, and 
invariably; and, on the other hand, all untrammelled 
scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to re- 
ligion some of its stages may have seemed for the time

to be, has invariably resulted in the highest good both 
of religion and of science." 

From the standpoint of history, this struggle 
has actually been between organized theology 
and unorganized science. Preconceived notions 
of theological science became entangled with 
crude notions of all other sciences. In the 
experience of a single human life there is little 
to correct even the crudest theology. From the 
supposed greater importance of theology in de- 
termining the fate of the individual man, theo- 
logical conceptions have dominated all others. 
Throughout the ages the great churches have 
been the stronghold of conservatism ; religious 
bodies have formed the great organized army 
against which the separated bands of science 
hurled themselves apparently in vain. 

But it seems to me that the real essence of 
conservatism lies not in theology. The whole 
conflict is a struggle in the mind of man. It 
exists in human pyschology before it is wrought 
out in human history. It is the struggle of 
realities against tradition and suggestion. The 
progress of civilization would still have been 
just such a struggle, had religion or theology 
or churches or worship never existed. Intol- 
erance and prejudice are not confined to relig- 
ious organizations. The same spirit that burned 
Servetus and Giordano Bruno, led the atheist 
*' liberal " mob of Paris to send to the scaffold 
the great chemist Lavoisier, " with the sneer 
that the republic has no need of savants." The 
same spirit that leads the orthodox Gladstone 
to reject natural selection because it " relieves 
God of the labor of Creation," causes the heretic 
Hseckel to condemn Weismann's theories of 
heredity because such questions are settled 
once for all by the great philosophic dictum of 
Monism. 

Of President White's monumental work on 
" The Warfare of Science with Theology," we 
have only words of praise. In the two ample 
volumes before us, he has treated almost every 
phase of this great struggle. So far as we can 
see, he has everywhere written in a spirit of 
perfect fairness. His pages are filled with a 
wealth of quotations that would tell for them- 
selves the story of the " Warfare of Science," 
even if the author had not added a word of his 
own. And these quotations are reinforced by 
the fullest references to authorities, which will 
guide students to the original documents used 
by the author. With all this, President White 
is a master of English prose. His style is 
stately and lucid, rising at times to noble elo- 
quence. It is nowhere dull, or obscure, or 



undignified. His work is one of the great works 
of our century. It should find a place at every 
scholar's desk, in every library, in the mind of 
every thinking man. Religious men will be led 
to avoid the mistakes of intolerance by a knowl- 
edge of the dire evils to which intolerance has 

O 

led in the past. Scientific men will be spurred 
to better work by the record that through all 
the ages ideas have been tested by their rela- 
tion to realities. Only that which is true sur- 
vives. All men will be more sane and more 
effective in proportion as they realize that no 
good can come from " wishing to please God 
with a lie." 

This work deals mainly with the struggle of 
dogmatism to limit knowledge. But another 
phase of the same struggle is the desire of or- 
ganized conservatism to limit action. Just as 
science goes over into action, so does dogma- 
tism pass over into suppression. The struggle 
for democracy, the rise of the common man, is 
therefore part of the same great conflict. 

One phase of this struggle, in some regards 
the most important of all, is the movement 
towards secularization of education. This is 
the most important because in the schools of 
to-day the history of to-morrow is already writ- 
ten. In the long run, educational reforms are 
the most important of all reforms. 

In the preface to these volumes, President 
White gives us a modest glimpse at the great 
achievement of his own life, his struggles for 
the rescue of Higher Education in America 
from the grasp of medievalism and of secta- 
rianism. Among the basal ideas in the estab- 
lishment of Cornell University was this, as 
formulated by President White himself : " We 
had especially determined that the institution 
should be under the control of no political party 
and of no single religious sect." The single- 
ness of purpose of Cornell University, its devo- 
tion wholly to its work of the investigation and 
dissemination of truth, with " no other mark or 
brand upon it," stirred up the bigots in all sects 
alike. It was the persistent attacks of belated 
theologians and philosophers which first led 
Mr. White to investigate the records of the 
" warfare of science " in the past. The for- 
gotten obscurantists of twenty-five years ago 
did not live in vain. It is to them that we are 
indebted for the volumes before us, presented 
as an offering of honor to Cornell University, 
by her first President, at the end of her first 
quarter-century of growth.

"THE RENASCENCE OF THE ENGLISH 
DRAMA." * 

A good deal that is harsh has been said of 
the English drama of the present day, and a 
good deal of eulogy has been poured out upon 
contemporary dramatists of other countries. 
In each case a good deal has been said that is 
ill-considered, and a good deal that is well- 
deserved. One could hardly ask for a better 
chance to form a judgment than is offered by 
the recent publication of a translation of Suder- 
mann's " Heimat," and of " Michael and his 
Lost Angel " by Henry Arthur Jones. Both 
authors are well known, both plays are consid- 
ered excellent examples of their work ; and, fur- 
ther, the plays are not so very difficult of com- 
parison, for both are tragedies of domestic life. 
Mr. Jones is, I understand, one of the first 
of contemporary English playwrights. He has 
written a number of successful plays, and has 
published some of them ; he has written on the 
drama for the reviews, and has, indeed, pub- 
lished a good deal in one way or another, with 
the idea of giving dramatic matters the right 
turn ; he may very well be taken as represent- 
ative of actual tendencies in English play- 
writing. He is certainly and sincerely desirous 
of doing good work, work that shall make the 
current English drama really worthy of its past. 
This particular play, " Michael and his Lost 
Angel," it is true, was not successful on the 
stage. It ran only ten nights at the Lyceum, 
and although the takings were about X1500, 
as Mr. Jones informs us, it seems to have been 
regarded as a failure and rather suddenly with- 
drawn. But Mr. Joseph Knight, who contri- 
butes an introduction to the play, thinks it a 
fine piece of work in many respects a tri- 
umph, Mr. Jones's masterpiece, the best play 
he has given the stage. Mr. Knight believes 
that " in some respects the loves of Michael 
Feversham and Audrie Lesden seem to take 
rank with the masterpieces of human passion, 
if not with Romeo and Juliet, with Cupid and 
Psyche, with Paul and Virginia, and shall we 
add with Edgar of Ravenswood and Lucy Ash- 
ton, at least with Helen and Paris, Antony and 
Cleopatra, and Manon Lescaut and the Chev- 
alier des Grieux." It is true that this view of 
Mr. Knight's may arouse an opinion which will 
be strengthened by his fancy that Habington

is one of the best-known of the Tudor dramat- 
ists ; but, whatever his knowledge of literature, 
Mr. Knight has evidently read Mr. Jones's 
plays which is more than some of us have 
ione, and we shall not run into error by tak- 
ing this play as a fair representative of Mr. 
Jones's work and of the " renascent " English 
drama of our time. 

What, then, is this play ? Our readers may 
be surprised to learn that they can obtain an 
excellent idea of it from the first act alone. 
The Reverend Michael Feversham, about forty, 
with a pale, strong, calm, ascetic, scholarly face, 
and other proper accompaniments, has discov- 
ered that one of his parishioners has been se- 
duced. He forces her to make a public con- 
fession in church, and sends her to a sisterhood 
in London. Another of his parishioners, a 
recent one, is a rich, worldly, presumable 
widow, whom the clergyman dislikes because 
he thinks her frivolous and insincere, although 
she has been fascinated by his book, " The 
Hidden Life," and contributes largely to his 
effort to restore the minster. Could we have 
better materials for a stagy and conventional 
adaptation of " The Scarlet Letter " ? 

When Hawthorne handled this idea, he 
handled it with a very different view and in a 
very different way ; and by narrating merely 
the expiation and not the guilt, and that even 
under the influence of a powerfully moulding 
moral force, succeeded in developing a painful 
but splendid climax. But Mr. Jones would 
seem to have no moral force ; and, on the other 
hand, he has the very modern interest in temp- 
tation. He therefore presents to us his ascetic 
converted by propitious circumstances into an 
animal, and then reconverted into the ascetic, 
who, although he acts galvanically in the old 
ways, always remembers with regret the fierce- 
ness of the one moment of evil. He offers his 
pair of lovers an opportunity in which even 
Mr. Knight thinks Michael might have be- 
haved with more delicacy, and so puts one in 
quite the humor to enjoy the subsequent fool- 
ing about in the chancel of the rebuilt min- 
ster, the open confession of the clergyman, the 
final death of the lady, and the immediately 
consequent reception of the gentleman into the 
Catholic Church. This is the kind of thing 
that has been considered the masterpiece of one 
of the first playwrights of a great dramatic era. 
Of Sudermann's "Heimat" we need not 
speak at length ; many of our readers will have 
seen it on the stage, or read it in the original. 
Those who have not the German at hand will 



150 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



find in this translation a good substitute. 
Whether it be or be not Sudermann's master- 
piece, it has his strong points, and has been 
received in Germany with an attention that is 
as creditable to the German audiences as the 
disfavor shown to " Michael and his Lost An- 
gel " is creditable to the audiences of London. 

We have all heard, at least, of the Prodigal 
Son ; and we may have known prodigal sons 
ourselves, for certainly the tale is not an old- 
fashioned one. But there is this turn which it 
may take : suppose the Prodigal do not squan- 
der his heritage and become a pig-keeper ; sup- 
pose, instead, he works hard, achieves success, 
and becomes great and honored. What chance, 
then, has the simplicity, the honor, the small 
narrowness of Home in comparison with the 
freedom of individuality and the ever-changing 
splendor of worldly success? This play of 
Sudermann's presents to us the conventional, 
bigoted, cramped life of a little German town, 
and the return home of a successful, glorious 
singer, who was born there. The point is focus 
for unending lines of life : old ideas and young 
blood, the power of home and the power of the 
world, duty and freedom, conventionality and 
individualism, here a great dramatist will 
find freedom of movement. So, in such a sit- 
uation Sudermann places his characters and 
produces a real tragedy, something which we 
read to the end and then put away with a sub- 
dued feeling of relief. Character, humor, pa- 
thos, the drama has ; but, chief of all, that 
classic quality, the power of chilling and calm- 
ing the moral temper by the pity and awe called 
up by the imagination of the playwright. 

All this does not seem to give a complete 
account of this play. It would be more fitting, 
perhaps, in a critical journal, to comment on 
the strength of the character-drawing, the fine- 
ness of the humor, or to compare Sudermann 
with Ibsen on the one hand or Echegaray on 
the other. These things must be left to the 
several readers ; the main point here is to note 
the difference between the English drama of 
our own day, and well, any other drama 
where there are really strong men at work. 

Mr. Jones is undoubtedly well-meaning ; no 
one who reads his non-dramatic work will doubt 
that he desires earnestly that the English 
drama should be a real field for a man of genius. 
It is only when one comes to read one of his 
plays that one begins to doubt ; or, if not to 
doubt his intention, at least to see that good 
intentions only do not make great works of art.

AMERICAN 



The peculiar features of American money, as seen 
by the European traveller, are the dirty dollar bills 
and the bronze pennies ; while in the mind of the 
average American the prominent fact, probably, is 
the existence of national banks which enjoy the 
monopoly of the right to issue notes for circulation 
" as money." Yet neither of these characteristics 
is in any way fundamental : they play no important 
part in the discussion of a " sound " or an " honest " 
monetary system. The soiled bills could easily be 
withdrawn from circulation, and public health, as 
well as morals and aesthetics, would be greatly im- 
proved ; all that is necessary is that the government 
should keep the post-offices of the country supplied 
with freshly-printed notes, and authorize them to 
forward worn and torn bills to the Treasury depart- 
ment by mail : the cost would be trifling. Our cur- 
rency would not be changed in principle, but im- 
proved in practice, if pennies were made of alum- 
inum, or of some metalic mixture other than bronze ; 
they are manufactured for sale just as any other 
commodity is, except that a government monopoly 
has been established, like that of tobacco and cigars, 
or matches, in several European governments. 
Finally, the national bank-notes are secured by gov- 
ernment bonds deposited with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, so that they are in reality government 
paper currency and not bank currency : their value 
depends in no way upon the continued solvency of 
the bank which issued them ; for, whether the bank 
fail or not, they are redeemed by the Treasury de- 
partment through the sale of the bonds deposited 
for them when the individual bank began business. 
The real reform of American currency involves 
other considerations than these which appear on the 
surface. 

Unfortunately, the problem is an exceedingly 
complicated one. Mr. Gordon, in his work on "Con-

characterizes our national currency as the inconse- 
quential, incongruous, and unscientific result of ex- 
travagant and hazardous legislative experiments,

THE DIAL 




Congress, a Congressional currency, with many 
anomalous and unique features. The question at 
issue in the present campaign is consequently not a 
clearly defined and simple one. Even if we limit 
our consideration to the question of the free coinage 
of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one, the situation 
is far from plain ; there are at least four separate 
problems involved, of industrial history, of eco- 
nomic theory, of ethical principle, and of political 
policy ; namely : 

(1) Has the price of gold risen appreciably in 
recent years, either from industrial or legislative 
influences ? 

(2) Is it possible to maintain a permanent ratio 
of exchange between two commodities, like gold and 
silver, under conditions of free production? 

(3) Will the right to have 371^ grains of silver 
coined in the same way that multiples of 23.22 
grains of gold are now coined at the mint, insure 
an honest dollar? 

(4) Is it wise for the United States alone to 
undertake the free coinage of these metals at the 
ratio of sixteen to one? 

There seems to be room for honest differences of 
opinion on each of these questions ; but they do not 
by any means exhaust the problems involved in the 
money question and in a revision of the system of 
American currency. On the one hand, the private 
control of gold by the international syndicates that 
are so easily formed has driven various governments, 
as well as our own, to undertake the issue business 
as well as the deposit business of banks. On the 
other hand, the failure of our government in the 
last thirty years to provide a paper currency of 
suitable proportions to accommodate business men 
in their ordinary commercial transactions has led 
to the use of private or personal money in the shape 
of certified checks, drafts, bills of exchange, clear- 
ing-house certificates, etc. Two questions thus stand 
opposed one to another : Shall the government go 
out of the banking business ? or, shall the ten per 
cent tax on circulation other than that of national 
banks be abolished, and a system of bank currency 
made possible? 

In the confused state of the currency, as well as 
the still more confused condition of the public mind 
upon the nature, origin, and function of money in 
general and the reform of American currency in 
particular, we are doubly indebted for such a clear 
and simple, straightforward statement of the exist- 
ing facts as Mr. Gordon gives in his " Congressional 
Currency," and for such a rational, fair-minded, 
and scholarly defense of the proposed plan for re- 
form as President Walker offers in his " Interna- 
tional Bimetallism." Each of these little books 
should be issued in an inexpensive form and dis- 
tributed as a campaign document in this campaign 
of education, for they throw light on both national 
and international politics, as well as on the disputed 
questions of monetary science. 

Three things are essential to any radical improve- 
ment of the currency : (1) A logical criticism of 



what is ; (2) broad philosophical grounds for what 
should be ; and ( 3 ) a practical programme for 
passing from the present good to the future better. 
Mr. Gordon's criticism is political rather than 
economic, and is along the line of attack suggested 
in Professor Woodrow Wilson's " Congressional 
Government " on the one hand, and of Professor 
Kinley's " Independent Treasury of the United 
States " on the other. By way of resume, the au- 
thor quotes a statement from the latter work to the 
effect that in addition to the duties for which the 
independent treasury was organized, of receiving 
and disbursing the money of the government, it 
now discharges the functions, first, of a bank of issue, 
with the usual reserve ; second, of a bank of deposit, 
general and special ; third, of a redemption agent 
for the national banks as well as the government ; 
fourth, of a transfer agent for carrying money to 
different parts of the country, either free of charge 
or at lower rates than is charged by banks ; and 
lastly, of a silver bullion broker, from July 14, 
1890, to November 1, 1893. Against all this 
increase of Congressional activity, Mr. Gordon 
strongly inveighs, and pleads for the return to our 
system of fifty years ago, when " the heavy and 
unsteady hand " of Congress was withdrawn from 
the absolute control of currency. 

Mr. Conant's elaborate " History of Modern 
Banks of Issue " may be regarded as in a sense sup- 
plementary to the short essay of Mr. Gordon. It 
shows us the way in which Mr. Gordon's hope may 
be realized, and the government can fulfil all its 
protective duties and still let the money market take 
care of itself. The purpose of his book is to set 
forth the principles and uses of a banking currency 
the essential feature of which is the circulation of 
notes payable to bearer and redeemable in coin, but 
only partly covered by a coin reserve. To show how 
this result may be accomplished, he gives a detailed 
history of the leading banks of issue in the world 
and an account of their methods of doing business. 
The failures and experiments of the last hundred 
years have brought the bank of issue into a practi- 
cable and easily workable system. It only remains 
for the law to enforce the lessons learned in that 
period, and remove the confusion that has arisen 
in the public mind and separated bank notes from 
other forms of credit, other evidences of debt, which 
differ from them only in degree of negotiability. 

" A bank of issue simply takes the titles to capital 
which have been transferred to its custody and loans 
them to its customers in the form of negotiable paper 
(page 10). Its business is simply to transform the bill 
of exchange, which is itself a negotiable security, into 
another sort of negotiable security. In promising to 
pay at sight, the difficulty is avoided of maturity at a 
fixed term and the bearer is relieved of the limitations 
which result from it. By the promise to pay to bearer, 
one gets rid of the embarrassment of endorsements, pro- 
tests, recourse, etc. One obtains by this means a secur- 
ity always negotiable" (page 5). 

No new capital is created, but the mobility of that 



152 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



which exists is greatly increased. When a note is 
discounted at the bank, the officers are not lending 
the merchant their money, but are buying from him 
a debt due to him. 

" In individual cases, the creator of a paper credit 
may obtain the use of more capital than he possesses, 
but in every such case he simply obtains the use of the 
capital of some other person or body of persons. The 
bank note simply assists in the movement of capital " 
(page 9). 

The common argument against the issue of paper 
money is that it paves the way for panic and indus- 
trial depression, by piling up a vast credit structure 
on a slender basis of coin, the favorite metaphor 
being an inverted pyramid, supported in unstable 
equilibrium upon a golden apex. 

" A better image than that of the inverted pyramid 
would be that of the railway or canal, which by a single 
route permits the happy interchange of all commodities. 
Proper facilities for transportation do not require a car 
for every carload of wheat which exists, nor a canal 
broad enough for all vessels to pass abreast. The possi- 
bility of having the car when it is needed, the promise 
of the use of the canal for a brief time, serve every 
purpose; and no one thinks of charging that the trans- 
portation system is a vast structure of credit resting 
upon a few real cars or upon abnormally narrow tracks " 
(page 465). 

That modern industry and commerce require paper 
money is hardly a debatable question. Notes of the 
bank or the government are merely the small-change 
of commercial transactions. A metallic currency 
of the volume of the money at present in use in the 
United States about $1,600,000,000 would cost 
$45,000,000 annually. Over ninety per cent of 
bank exchanges, and probably over eighty per cent 
of retail trade, even in country districts, is done by 
paper money and book credits. The issue is between 
private or individual money and a currency regu- 
lated by law and issued either by the government 
or the banks. The object of Mr. Conant's book is 
to " convince thinking Americans of the axiomatic 
truth that the currency of a commercial country 
should be regulated by commercial conditions, and 
not by the whims of politicians " The modern use 
of credit instruments is as great a marvel in its way 
as the development of the power of steam or elec- 
tricity; and, like them, it has its dangers. The 
touchstone of sound banking currency is redemption 
in standard coin on demand; but a bank may put 
too large a portion of its assets into forms which 
cannot be quickly turned into cash loans on doubt- 
ful paper, or on real estate, or in industrial enter- 
prises that tie money up for a long period. This is 
no argument against banking currency in itself, but 
against an abuse of credit in sinking capital in un- 
productive enterprises and taking speculative risks. 
The true business of banking consists in dealing in 
short-time commercial paper. A bank-note thus 
represents the value of commodities that are in pro- 
cess of .production and exchange. It becomes what 
Adam Smith called a wagon-way through the air. 
But " governments seldom resort to the issue of 



paper money until their lack of credit impairs their 
other resources " (page 572). Fiat money thus not 
only does not represent wealth, but it cannot be 
readily exchanged for wealth. It is a wagon-way 
through the air, which has connection with the 
clouds and not with the earth. 

" Governments have no quick assets. The advocates 
of government paper money are fond of declaring that 
a national currency is based on the aggregate wealth and 
credit of the entire nation. But they miss the purpose 
of currency and banks of issue. It is not wealth in the 
abstract which currency must represent, but quickly 
negotiable wealth. . . . Custom houses and highways, 
npld guns and ironclads, are not the sort of assets which 
can be quickly marketed or put in pawn to borrow money, 
and the power of taxation is even less efficient as secur- 
ity for a banking business. It is in the nature of an 
assessment upon the stockholders, which is a worthless 
resource during solvency and is resorted to only for 
liquidation after suspension of payments (page 574). 
The state is not a money lender nor a receiver of de- 
posits payable on demand " (page 566) . 

Moreover, the volume of a government paper cur- 
rency always tends to conform to the needs of the 
government itself ; but a banking currency arises 
out of the needs of commerce, and tends to adapt 
itself to the necessities of trade, foreign as well as 
domestic. A slight redundancy of the currency 
leads merchants and bankers to send home notes 
for redemption. When redeemed, they are not re- 
issued ; whereas, a law of Congress requires that 
the government shall pay out legal tenders again as 
soon as they have been presented and exchanged 
for gold. The bank, by raising the rate of discount, 
holds money in the country and prevents its being 
sunk in doubtful industry. A banking currency is 
thus the hand-maid of commerce, as it should be, 
and not the instrument of political power. 

Another, and for Americans perhaps the most 
important, advantage of a banking currency, is the 
fact that it paves the way for deposit banking and 
promotes the banking facilities and the use of credit 
instruments in the community. The poverty of 
this means of carrying on business is a striking fea- 
ture of many parts of the South and West. The 
remedy lies, not in the free coinage of silver, but 
in a system of banking that shall be supervised by 
the national government, and will secure uniformity 
and constant convertibility of bank-notes into coin, 
but shall also afford the banking facilities which a 
government paper money is powerless to offer. 

Mr. Conant of course assumes that there is a 
standard money of redemption, and says that it is 
of prime importance that there should be a fixed 
metallic standard of value. Since 1834 this stand- 
ard has been 23.22 grains of fine gold ; but Mr. 
Del Mar, in his " Science of Money," maintains 
that it has not been and cannot be " fixed " so long 
as private coinage is allowed and the money-changers 
are thus able to determine the number of coins that 
shall be issued and put in circulation in the world's 
currency. The policy is both senseless and mis- 
chievous ; one more so was never procured (page x.). 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



153 



Mr. Del Mar urges that money is a mechanism 
designed to measure value with precision, and that 
the unit of money is all money ; that the efficiency 
of all measures, money included, depends upon the 
exactness of their limits ; that the limitation of the 
supply of money was anciently a prerogative of the 
state, and that it should be so again. 

" The essential point is not what the coins are made 
of, nor what the notes promise, but how many of them 
there are, and what assurance there is that this number 
will remain constant (page 47). The important matter 
is that gold has been ' cornered ' ; that commerce trem- 
bles when a million of yellow pieces are shipped abroad ; 
and that your present monetary policy is pinning down 
the future to wholly impossible and ruinous conditions, 
opposed to prosperity and fatal to liberty" (page 56). 

The author presents much that is interesting but 
hardly scientific, and offers but a scant page and a 
half out of two hundred pages to a consideration of 
the grave difficulties as to the manner in which we 
are to determine how the " sum of money may best 
be regulated." He deems it necessary to business 
prosperity that this be left to " the representatives 
of the people, whose patriotism, conservatism, and 
societary instinct furnish a far more reliable basis 
for the stability of money, than the doctrines, the 
prejudices, or the selfishness of the new plutocracy " 
(page 84). 

The value of the dollar of account certainly ought 
not to depend upon an accidental majority ; but to 
say, on the other hand, that it should represent 
invariably a certain weight and fineness of the pre- 
cious metals, is putting the cart before the horse : 
it is the metal which represents the dollar. The 
purpose is to find something which shall invariably 
represent the mental estimate which is our unit of 
value. Shall this be a particular amount of gold, 
or silver, or both ? President Walker, in his " Inter- 
national Bimetallism," suggests: 

" It cannot be considered unfair to call the attention 
of those who have been fond of speaking of silver as 
something that may become too cheap for the principal 
monetary uses of civilized and progressive nations, to the 
fact that, within our own time, the continued monetary 
use of gold was seriously endangered by its cheapness; 
and that it was silver which enjoyed the preference " 
(page 137). 

The real question is not whether silver is more 
stable in value than gold, or gold than silver, and 
as to which of them should therefore be chosen to 
represent the unit of value ; but whether the free 
coinage of both metals at a given ratio as to the 
weight of coins will not so affect the demand for 
either at different times as to keep the price from 
fluctuating beyond an appreciable limit which would 
be economically so small as to prevent either from 
driving the other out of use as money, and thus se- 
cure a more stable representative of the unit of value. 
" The only question that can possibly arise is as to 
the degree of the effect prodviced. On this point, diver- 
gence is to be expected and to be tolerated. . . . Men 
will take positions on the subject according to their pre- 
dilections, according to the amount of their information, 



according to their temperament and habit of mind. 
This is simply to say that the question of bimetallism, 
like the question of protection, and, indeed, like most 
other questions in economics, is purely a question of 
degree. The quality of the effect is conceded. The 
quantity of the effect is in dispute " (page 97) . 

President Walker's opinion is that " the efforts made 
by this country, for itself alone, to rehabilitate sil- 
ver are prejudicial to our own national interests and 
to the cause of true international bimetallism " 
(page iv.). He is a bimetallist of the international 
type, believing that, 

" Should international bimetallism ever be estab- 
lished, it will be through diplomatic negotiations quietly 
conducted, without speech-making or ceremony, between 
the four nations, France, England, Germany, and the 
United States, any three of which can, at any time, bring 
about the result. If those four nations, or any three of 
them, shall ever agree to act together in this matter, 
the programme thus formed would secure the immediate 
and unquestioning assent of a sufficient number of the 
less important states to carry it to a triumphant issue '* 
(page 230). 

Mr. Walker does not state what he thinks this pro- 
gramme should be, declining to discuss the question 
of the actual ratio to be taken in any attempt to 
restore international bimetallism. AH talk about 
the existing ratio of thirty to one, however, he 
regards as silly, as the present condition of the 
market is the necessary result of the demonetization 
of silver by the various countries of Europe in the 
period from 1871 to 1879. What the ratio would 
have to be under a remonetization of silver, in order 
to maintain " a real and reasonably permanent 
bimetallism " (page 65) can only be determined 
properly and logically when the question is settled 
whether a strong and serious effort shall be made 
to reestablish international bimetallism. His de- 
fense of the general principle is based primarily on 
the testimony of history, and secondarily on the 
theories of economic science. Beginning with the 
enormous production of the precious metals by slave 
labor in early times, when everything belonged to 
the princes and the metals were distributed by war 
and not by trade, the story is told in succeeding 
chapters (1) of the waste of gold and silver from the 
time of Augustus to that of Columbus ; (2) of " the 
period of tumultuous, overwhelming, revolutionary 
inflation " that followed the discoveries in Mexico 
and South America, when silver fell from a ratio of 
eleven to one of gold to a ratio of fifteen to one ; (3) 
of bimetallism in England, 1666 to 1816 ; (4) of 
the increasing demand for gold early in this century, 
and its enormous production after 1848, when only 
the barrier of bimetallism in France prevented gold 
from falling, " in a succession of plunges, from crag 
to crag, down to a level which would mean nothing 
less than universal bankruptcy " (page 123); (5) of 
the impossibility of making a fair trial of bimetal- 
lism in this country prior to 1873 ; (6) of demon- 
etization ; and (7) of the great debate, in the series 
of international monetary conferences. From begin- 
ning to end, the story is told in an eminently fair- 



154

[Sept. 16 > 



minded way, with the light touches of a Harvard 
lecture-course which will entertain as well as instruct 
an audience, and in the scholarly style of a master 
who has heard all the opponents have to offer, and 
finds it wanting when subjected to rational criti- 
cism. His argument from economic theory, unfor- 
tunately, is not calculated to convince the mono- 
metallist, so much of the matter in controversy is 
assumed in each case argued, under the phraseology 
of " other things being equal." The trouble lies in 
the fact, to which Mr. Walker frequently refers in 
the historical outline given, that other things are 
very likely not to be equal. When one of the vari- 
ables in an economic problem is changed, one or 
more of the others will probably change also. 

Mr. McPherson, in treating " The Monetary and 
Banking Problem," does not condescend to argue 
the case. He simply quotes Mr. W. A. Shaw to the 
effect that the bimetallic idea " is not borne out by 
a single instance in history" (page 71), and goes 
on to show what a poor unit of value gold has been. 

" A debt of one hundred dollars incurred twenty-five 
years ago, if paid to-day in gold, would inure to the 
creditor double the amount of benefit that the borrower 
obtained at the time the debt was incurred; because 
prices, measured by the gold standard, of nearly all the 
staple products clothing, shoes, furniture, grain, nails, 
tools, watches, drugs, glass, carpets have in the last 
generation fallen in about the same degree that the price 
of silver has fallen " (page 84). 
In the future, he insists, gold will be even less fitted 
to serve as a standard of value which may measure 
justice to all and injustice to none, in measuring 
and rewarding human effort, and that the medium 
of exchange and measure of value should be based 
directly upon the results of human effort. He admits 
that this is an ideal standard which can only be 
attained through slow and painful development, but 
believes that the increasing use of paper representa- 
tives of commodities in general and property of all 
kinds, which form the real basis of bank currency, 
tends to develope an ultimate standard independent 
of both coin and bullion, gold or silver, which con- 
sists of a unit of force or human energy. He urges 
that it is high time that we should dethrone Money 
from the pedestal of vain mythological meaning, and 
learn that money is but the hand-maid of human 
effort. The first step toward the ideal standard 
lies in an improvement of our lax and disjointed 
banking system, by which shrewd, plausible, and 
unscrupulous men can put the whole system of indus- 
try in a hazardous condition by a little juggling with 
exchanged notes discounted at separate and officially 
separated banks. The successful features of Scotch 
and Canadian banking, if incorporated into the 
American system, would tend directly toward that 
fluctuating supply of currency which is the requisite 
of progressive industry. 

Under our present system, the question of money 
is as inextricably bound up with the subject of taxa- 
tion on the one hand as it is with banking on the other. 
The question of " honest " money has to do with 



the value of the unit chosen to represent the dollar. 
It is fixed by law, and varies by reason of changes in 
natural conditions affecting the supply of the metal 
chosen, or by reason of changes in industrial and 
commercial conditions affecting demand. " Sound " 
money has reference only to the certainty of re- 
demption in coin of the promises to pay dollars. 
During the Civil War the government of the United 
States issued some hundreds of millions of promises 
to pay on demand, without interest, and made these 
notes legal tender. Their redemption was stopped 
by law in 1868, and nearly $350,000,000 remains 
to be paid. Under the law of 1890, which was re- 
pealed November 1, 1893, the government bought 
about 150,000,000 ounces of silver, and paid for it 
in treasury notes which promise to pay " coin " on 
demand. This silver, and such gold as is not held 
to redeem the gold certificates outstanding, is kept 
in the Treasury as a reserve to pay these notes when 
presented. They do not differ in character from 
any other promissory notes, and, like all other notes, 
are presented whenever there arises a reasonable 
doubt of the ability of the issuer to pay on demand. 
This, in the case of the government, is whenever 
taxes fail to yield the amount necessary to meet 
current expenses. Aside from all other disturb- 
ances, that has been the situation of the United 
States government for the last three years. It is this 
critical condition of the national finances which 
makes Mr. Howe's excellent account of " Taxation 
and Taxes in the United States under the Internal 
Revenue System " peculiarly timely. The experi- 
ences he records " indicate most clearly how almost 
inexhaustible are the sources of taxation as yet un- 
touched, of which the Treasury may avail itself in 
case of need, and show an array of unused taxes and 
unopened resources unparalleled in contemporary 
budgetary history " (page v.). He shows that inter- 
nal taxes should never be wholly relinquished, but 
" that in time of peace the machinery for immedi- 
ately realizing upon the currently created wealth 
of the country should never be permitted to get out 
of running order " (page 70) ; that " with the pos- 
sible exception of the taxes on distilled and fer- 
mented liquors, there are probably no subjects bet- 
ter fitted for taxation by the Federal government 
than certain corporations whose business is of an 
inter-state character" (pages 102-103), the tax 
being levied on the gross receipts of the transporta- 
tion company ; that taxes on the assessed valuation 
of property are especially objectionable in a federal 
system, " indefinite in their productivity and inelas- 
tic in character, . . . combining almost all the de- 
fects of the excise with those of the income and 
direct land tax " (page 111) ; that the income tax 
stands as a sort of equalizer to such taxes as those 
on liquors and tobacco, which are in effect exagger- 
ated poll taxes (page 238 ) ; and that time is a most 
essential requisite to efficiency in an excise system ; 
and " that a moderate rate of taxation will in the 
long run prove more productive, and less prejudi- 
cial to the moral, social, and industrial interests of 



1896.]

a nation, than one so excessive in amount as to en- 
courage evasion, speculation, and fraud " (page 81). 
" Experience has demonstrated that the best fiscal 
policy always advises that taxation should be so devised 
as to allow the largest possible freedom to the individ- 
ual and the greatest liberty to industry, and that this is 
best attained by a concentration of the excise upon the 
smallest number of objects consistent with efficiency of 
administration " (page 229). 

Professor Seligman, in a volume of collected 
"Essays on Taxation," presents both the history 
and the theory of taxation, particularly that of cor- 
porations. The inheritance tax, he says, scarcely 
needs defence to-day : but he holds that the single 
tax is defective fiscally, politically, morally, and 
economically ; he refuses to discuss it as a scheme 
for introducing the social millennium. He condemns 
the general property tax from the triple standpoint 
of history, theory, and practice, and believes it, as 
actually administered, to be beyond all doubt one 
of the worst taxes known in the civilized world. 

" Because of its attempt to tax intangible as well as 
tangible things, it sins against the cardinal rules of uni- 
formity, of equality, and of universality of taxation. It 
puts a premium on dishonesty and debauches the public 
conscience; it reduces deception to a system, and makes 
a science of knavery; it presses hardest on those least 
able to pay ; it imposes double taxation on one man, and 
grants entire immunity to the next. In short, the gen- 
eral property tax is so flagrantly inequitable, that its 
retention can be explained only through ignorance or 
inertia. It is the cause of such crying injustice that its 
alteration or its abolition must become the battle-cry of 
every statesman and reformer" (page 61). 

From the brief survey of the development of taxa- 
tion with which Professor Seligman's volume opens, 
however, one fact stands out prominently, "the 
slow and laborious growth of standards of justice in 
taxation, and the attempt on the part of the com- 
munity as a whole to realize this justice." We are 
endeavoring to put into practice the principle that 
each individual should be held to help the state in 
proportion to his ability to help himself. It may be 
doubted whether this will long remain our concep- 
tion of justice.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Curiotities of 
the Miltonian 
Astronomy. 



Mr. Orchard's "Astronomy of Mil- 
ton's Paradise Lost" (Longmans) 
is in some respects a disappointing 
book. The title itself is almost a misnomer, since 
more than half of the 338 pages that make up the 
book are devoted to historical and descriptive as- 
tronomy, and are only distantly related to the 
author's real subject. There are also many trifling 
inaccuracies of expression ; some of these the au- 
thor could doubtless explain away, because they are 
in the main of no great importance, but the fre- 
quency with which they occur disturbs one's con- 



fidence in the accuracy of the author's scholarship. 
Here are two examples : on page 165, the method 
by parallax is alluded to as " a method called ( Par- 
allax ' "; on page 34 the word " observation," used 
in connection with the labors of Kepler, might give 
the reader a wrong notion of what Kepler really did 
for astronomy. On page 102, Milton's " to save ap- 
pearances " is quoted and used in just the same way 
as one would use the modern idiom, without a sug- 
gestion of the technical meaning which the phrase in 
this instance has. On page 165, the author accepts 
Proctor's statement that the diameter of the earth's 
orbit is 183 millions of miles, whereas it has been 
shown to be nearly 186 millions of miles. In many 
cases Milton's allusions are only partially explained ; 
these slips are sometimes the result of carelessness 
as when it is stated, on page 149, that " The Sun 
is in the constellation Taurus in April," a statement 
that is correct as far as it goes, but as often the 
result of a lack of knowledge, as when it is stated 
that Milton's allusion to " other suns " is a refer- 
ence to Jupiter and Saturn. In this instance a 
knowledge of Verity's very plausible explanation 
would have bound the author to a fair discussion 
of the two interpretations, even though he were still 
to retain his present explanation. In dealing with 
the discussion which takes place between Adam and 
the Angel, in Book VIII., Mr. Orchard is neither 
as clear nor as precise as might be desired. We are 
by no means sure that we may " regard the views 
expressed by Adam as representing Milton's own 
opinions "; at any rate, it is hardly correct to say, 
with Mr. Orchard, that the views expressed by Adam 
" were in conformity with the Copernican theory," 
or, with Mr. Masson, that " Adam is represented as 
arriving by intuition at the Copernican theory." 
Putting aside our anxiety to prove that Milton 
inclined toward the Copernican theory, the lines are 
simply an expression of Adam's doubt in the truth 
of the Ptolemaic theory ; they are neither " in con- 
formity with," nor do they represent Adam as "ar- 
riving by intuition at," the Copernican theory. Mil- 
ton, like many men of his time, although familiar 
with the arguments presented in favor of the Co- 
pernican theory, accepted the Ptolemaic theory, not 
merely for poetical purposes, as Masson suggests, 
because the former theory would have suited these 
purposes quite as well as the latter, but because 
he was conservative enough to prefer a theory in 
the knowledge of which he had been versed from 
his childhood. The truth of this theory he at times 
doubted, but there is nothing in the " Paradise Lost " 
to indicate that Milton ever thought the Copernican 
theory more than a possible alternative. On the 
whole, then, it cannot be said that Mr. Orchard has 
added anything of importance to our knowledge of 
Milton, while in not a few instances he has failed 
to use all the material at his command. This is to 
be regretted, because the book is in other respects a 
well-written and interesting work. It needs an index, 
however, to make it serviceable for reference.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



A relic of 
yesterday. 



When " The Yellow Book " first ap- 
peared, an article called "A Defense 
of Cosmetics," by Mr. Max Beer- 
bohm, excited rage in some hearts. It was regarded 
as an insult, if not to the intelligence of the whole 
human race, at least to that part of it which was cog- 
nizant of " The Yellow Book." In the second num- 
ber Mr. Beerbohm explained that such was an unwar- 
ranted idea ; the article had not been intended as an 
insult to intelligence, but rather as a travesty upon 
certain contemporary tendencies. Now that the essay 
is given its due place in the " Works " of its gifted 
author (Scribner), it does not appear to be a trav- 
esty, unless all of Mr. Beerbohm 's work is to be re- 
garded as a travesty. It is in tone not very differ- 
ent from the other essays in the book. It is not, 
however, the best of Mr. Beerbohm's works. That 
proud honor we unhesitatingly award to the review 
of English Society of sixteen years ago. This little 
essay is a masterpiece, not only of superficial re- 
search, but of flippant seriousness. The reminis- 
cence of mashers and professional beauties, Mrs. 
Langtry and Connie Gilchrist, the Manola waltz, 
and sestheticism, is manipulated with a delicacy of 
satire that is excellent. Next in merit is the sketch 
of " A Good Prince "; although rather an ordinary 
deception, it is very charming in its developments. 
" Diminuendo " is also pleasant, although it has the 
contemporary curse of autobiography. The thor- 
ough and careful paper on " Dandies and Dandies " 
will give one ideas, even if it do not amuse. Less 
tempting are the article already mentioned and the 
biographical studies of George IV. (we are happily 
spared the awful picture which appeared in " The 
Yellow Book ") and of Romeo Coates. We think 
that if one will make up his mind not to be insulted 
by Mr. Beerbohm's impertinence, condescension, 
solemn absurdity, and naive artificialities, he will 
find this book delightfully funny. He may also be 
instructed ; for Mr. Beerbohm is a representative 
man not representative of the century, or even of 
the decade, but of the time being, of the instant 
which, as Taine says, changes while one is off on a 
journey. In temper he shows the sort of affecta- 
tion which we have seen in many young men in the 
last few years. In style he gives us the manner- 
isms of half a dozen contemporaries, from Walter 
Pater and Oscar Wilde to Mr. Le Gallienne and 
Mr. Zangwill. It may be that it is all a conscious 
travesty ; but it is surely not a very important mat- 
ter to decide whether it is or not. It is amusing, 
and what more should we ask? 

The Chautauqua books for the com- 

New books for fi num b er have just

been published, and form perhaps the 
most valuable collection of required reading that 
has yet been provided for students under the Chau- 
tauqua system. One of the books is Mr. W. C. 
Brownell's " French Traits," published in a new 
edition for this purpose, and too well and favorably 
known to need any comment. To go with this ad- 



mirably acute study of contemporary French civili- 
zation, Professor George B. Adams has been called 
upon to prepare a treatise on " The Growth of the 
French Nation," and has acquitted himself of this 
difficult task in a highly satisfactory manner. Greece 
joins with France in claiming the attention of this 
year's circle of Chautauqua readers, for two of the 
required volumes are " A Survey of Greek Civili- 
zation," by Professor J. P. Mahaffy, and " A His- 
tory of Greek Art," by Professor F. B. Tarbell. 
Professor Mahaffy's work is, of course, both com- 
petent and interesting, and just such a " Survey " 
as he has written will suit the needs of many read- 
ers who are not Chautauquans ; but we cannot help 
regretting the rather obtrusive and unpleasant reli- 
giosity of the preface with which he has seen fit 
to commend his book to its special American public. 
Professor Tarbell's book on Greek art has taken 
advantage of the latest achievements in classical 
archaeology, and is particularly noteworthy for the 
judicious selection of its illustrations. It " has been 
written in the conviction that the greatest of all mo- 
tives for studying art, the motive which is and ought 
to be strongest in most people, is the desire to be- 
come acquainted with beautiful and noble things." 
It need hardly be added that the text of this trea- 
tise displays both grace and accurate scholarship. 
The last of these five books is devoted to popular 
astronomy, and is called " A Study of the Sky." 
Dr. Herbert A. Howe, of Denver, is the author, and 
he has made an extremely readable book, avoiding 
mathematics and technicalities as far as possible 
without sacrifice of the real objects of such a manual. 

We do not think that the Rev. F. L. 

Evolution of Humphrevs's " Evolution of Church 

church music. ,* A, .. x ... . , 

Music (Scribner) will satisfy any 
serious reader who desires a reliable history and a 
plausible theory of religious music, both of which 
we might suppose would be provided for us. The 
author's habit of presenting us with quotations, often 
of some length, from unmentioned authors (despite 
his idea that he gives " due credit "), will not impress 
his readers favorably, and his discursive way of 
thinking seems to have prevented him from reach- 
ing any sound and useful bases for discussion. His 
book, however, will doubtless give desired informa- 
tion on the subject to not a few ; and if it succeeds 
also in impressing on the public mind some of its 
ideas on contemporary church music, it will not have 
been published in vain. For whatever may be the 
author's character as a historian or a theorist, he is 
a musician of cultivated taste and religious feeling. 
For our part, we willingly dispense with many 
things for the sake of his eminently sane opinions 
on boy choirs, church quartettes, gospel songs, 
hymns of silly or wicked wording, opera music 
slightly disguised or openly borrowed, and other 
matters which too often make our religious music 
to-day a sufficient reason for going anywhere on 
Sunday but to church. Nor is his criticism wholly 
destructive ; the choir leader will find interest also

in his positive suggestion. In fact, if readers will 
appreciate what they find, and not be disappointed 
at not finding what they may be right in expecting, 
they will be glad to have read the book. 

"TheMott -^ r - J' Fitzgerald Molloy's two- 
Gorgeous Lady volume life of " The Most Gorgeous 
Blessington." Lady Blessington " (imported by 
Scribner), a fourth edition of which is now issued, 
does full justice to her ladyship's dazzling and rather 
erratic career. The life-story of this daughter of a 
Tipperary squireen, and queen regnant of the fam- 
ous Gore House coterie, has in it all the essentials 
of a full-blown romance, and it loses nothing in the 
sympathetic hands of Mr. Molloy. The book teems, 
of course, with stories and pen-portraits of literary 
people Byron, Landor, Moore, Disraeli, Bulwer, 
N. P. Willis, and the rest ; and these elements con- 
stitute its chief interest for most readers. For Lady 
Blessington now shines (despite her one time " gor- 
geousness " and prodigious, if fleeting, literary 
vogue) mainly with a borrowed light, and sinks to 
the rank of those meeker literary luminaries who 
are remembered for their friendships rather than 
their performances. Yet one would gladly have seen 
Lady Blessington in all her glory ; and there is no 
doubt that she was in life vastly better company, 
and to all appearances vastly cleverer, than many 
of her friends who wrote vastly better books. Mr. 
Molloy's account of her will be found very enter- 
taining far more so than the average novel. It 
contains a charming portrait, after Lawrence, of 
her ladyship, which bears out Dr. Parr's " liquorish 
epithet." 

Autobiographical The extrinsic interest that attaches 
reminiscences of to the personality of celebrities will 
a musician. probably suffice for most people who 

read the autobiographical reminiscences of Charles 
Gounod (Macmillan). The contents of the book, 
gathered, beside the autobiographical sketch, from 
family letters and a few random papers, are duly 
personal and chatty ; and it is interesting also to 
note the artistic persuasions of the composer of one 
of the most popular operas ever written. Whether 
Faust was Gounod's own favorite or not, he seems 
to have judged it, like his other works, dispassion- 
ately. He says nothing, for instance, of the storm 
of controversy which the score raised in its day 
among the musical critics. That it seemed advanced 
to them was perhaps because he himself had been 
trained in so good and catholic a school. Palestrina, 
Bach, Cherubini, Mozart, Beethoven were among 
his early favorites ; he recognized the genius of 
Berlioz, and says a contemporary good word for 
Saint-Saens. He appears to have had, on the whole, 
more than most musicians, a definite and intellect- 
ual notion of what art is. His letters from Italy 
show genuine appreciation of its painters and musi- 
cians, and we find him, later, intelligently defend- 
ing the Ecole de Rome from the attacks of modern 
naturalism and realism. The translation from the 
French is the work of the Hon. W. Hely Hutchinson. 



Philosophy The popularity of Professor Henry 

and religion Jones's book on "Browning as a Phi- 

in Browning. l O8Op hical and Religious Teacher" 
(Macmillan) is evident from the fact that a third 
edition is now issued, in less than five years after 
the publication of the first. The method of the 
book is to marshal numerous passages from the poet, 
and from them to deduce a connected account of 
his ideas on religion and morality, and to discuss 
their philosophical validity. The great defect of 
such a method, as applied to Browning, is that, being 
a dramatic poet, a large part of such utterances 
belong to the characters he creates .Jew, Greek, 
Christian, or Persian and are not, in any sense, 
expressions of the poet's own personal opinions. It 
is no wonder, then, that Professor Jones finds 
Browning's philosophy " inconsistent " at many 
points, and that the reader, like the unlettered men 
after reading the annotated edition of Bunyan's 
" Pilgrim's Progress," finds the explanations more 
obscure than the text. Still, the book is one to 
stimulate thought, and will prove congenial to those 
fond of the phraseology of metaphysics. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

From the Roycrof t Printing Shop in East Aurora, New 
York, we have received two beautifully-printed books 
that must take a high rank among examples of the best 
modern workmanship in the craft which they exemplify. 
They are editions of the "Song of Songs" and the 
" Book of Ecclesiastes," each having an introductory 
essay by Mr. Elbert Hubbard. The books are hand- 
printed from a special font of Romanesque type, and 
are a delight to the eye. Both editions are limited. 

" Lyra Celtica " is the title of a beautifully-printed 
volume of representative Celtic poetry, edited by Mrs. 
Elizabeth A. Sharp, and provided by Mr. William Sharp 
with notes and an elaborate introduction. Besides the 
host of modern poets represented, the ancient bards of 
Cornwall, Armorica, Ireland, and Scotland are illus- 
trated in translations that have been made with excep- 
tional skill for the purpose. (Imported by Scribner.) 

" Jersey Street and Jersey Lane " (Scribner) is the 
title of a pretty volume containing a half-dozen clever 
urban and suburban sketches by the late H. C. Bunner. 
The titles are: "Jersey and Mulberry," "Tiemann's to 
Tubby Hook," "The Bowery and Bohemia," "The 
Story of a Patch," The Lost Child," " A Letter to 
Town." The papers abound in characteristic touches, 
whimsical and pathetic, and fairly illustrate the quali- 
ties which justly endeared Mr. Bunner to his readers. 
The book is acceptably illustrated. 

Baron Ferdinand Rothschild's " Personal Character- 
istics from French History " (Macmillan Co.) is a rather 
promiscuous assortment of French bon mots culled from 
many sources and strung together on a thin thread of 
not very searching or felicitous comment and apprecia- 
tion, with a view of helping the reader to " an idea, 
however superficial, of some of the salient characteris- 
tics of certain notable actors in the drama of French 
history." The Baron's list begins with Hugues Capet, 
and ends with the Abb3 Sie'yes. The work has a cer- 
tain scrap-book value, and has seventeen portraits.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



ANNOUNCEMENTS or FALL, BOOKS. 

THE DIAL'S list of books announced for Fall issue by 
American publishers, which has become an important 
annual feature of the paper, is this year the largest ever 
given. It contains about 900 titles, against 700 last 
year; and represents fifty-one publishers, nine more 
than last year. The average of books to a publisher is 
also increased, eighteen this year, and seventeen last 
year. The greatest number of entries for one house 
(that of the Macmillan Co.) is an even hundred titles. 
The classification of, the books into departments adds 
greatly to the interest of the list, and furnishes the 
basis of some suggestive analysis and comment in the 
leading editorial article of this issue. The great length 
of the list makes it necessary to defer the department 
of Juveniles until our next number. All the books in 
this list are presumably new books new editions not 
being included unless having new form or matter.

LITERARY NOTES. 

The British Museum acquired last year a collection 
of over a thousand different editions and translations of 
" The Imitation of Christ." 

The Graduate Club of Bryn Mawr College is about 
to publish a " Handbook of Courses Open to Women in 
English, European, and Canadian Universities." 

The Oxford University Press, through the agency of 
Mr. Henry Frowde, is about to open a branch of its 
publishing and bookselling business in New York. 

" Denounced," a novel by Mr. Bloundelle-Burton, is 
the two-hundredth issue in the " Town and Country " 
series of fiction published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

The very attractive edition of Marryat, published 
by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., has just had three ac- 
cessions in the shape of "Poor Jack," "The King's 
Own," and " Joseph Rushbrook." 

" Ce"sar Birotteau," translated by Miss Ellen Mar- 
riage, and " Modeste Mignon," translated by Mrs. Bell, 
both with introductions by Professor Saintsbury, appear 
in the Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac. 

"Genesis," in "The Modern Reader's Bible," and 
two more volumes of Tennyson, including " Rizpah " 
and " The Voyage of Maeldune," in the pretty " Peo- 
ple's " edition, have been received from the Macmillan 
Company. 

" Thirty Years of Paris and of My Literary Life " 
and " Recollections of a Literary Man," by M. Alphonse 
Daudet, are translated by Miss Laura Ensor, and just 
published in the Dent-Macmillan edition of the distin- 
guished French author. 

The date of this issue of THE DIAL is also the date 
set by Dr. John Watson for his departure from Liver- 
pool. He will be in this country about three months, 
under the management of Major Pond, and is booked 
for over fifty lectures. He will be in Chicago, as the 
guest of the Twentieth Century Club, on the 21st of 
October. 

" The Athenaeum " is the source of the following 
note : " The death is announced of the German lady who 
was known under the name of ' Camilla Selden,' and 
who so tenderly nursed Heine during the last months 
of his painful illness. The poet, who gave her the name 
of ' Mouche,' addressed to her his last poem, and the 
letters he wrQte to her were most pathetic. ' Camilla 
Selden,' whose real name was Elise von Krienitz, pub- 
lished in 1884 a book entitled Les Derniers Jours de 
Henri Heine.' She latterly resided at Rouen, gaining 
her livelihood as a teacher of German." 

We learn from the London " Literary World " that 



Mr. R. Farquharson Sharp has in preparation a work 
entitled "A Concise Dictionary of English Literature: 
Biographical and Bibliographical," designed to give in 
compact form the salient features of the lives and works 
of all authors who have made any notable contribution 
to English literature. Such authors from over the 
Atlantic as Emerson, Hawthorne, etc., whose writings 
form an integral portion of the great body of English 
literature, will be represented, and the work will include 
such living authors as Mr. Swinburne and Mr. William 
Morris. 

Eight new " Old South Leaflets " have just been issued. 
The first of these leaflets, No. 66, is a reprint of Win- 
throp's famous " Little Speech " on Liberty, as given in 
the old Governor's Journal; No. 67 is Cotton Mather's 
"Bostonian Ebenezer," from the "Magnalia"; No. 68, 
Governor Hutchinson's account of the Boston Tea 
Party, from his "History of Massachusetts Bay"; No. 
69, Adrian Van der Donck's Description of New Neth- 
erlands in 1655; No. 70, The Debate in the Constitu- 
tional Convention of 1787 on the Rules of Suffrage in 
Congress; No. 71, Columbus's Memorial to Ferdinand 
and Isabella, on his Second Voyage ; No. 72, The Dutch 
Declaration of Independence in 1581; No. 73, Captain 
John Knox's Account of the Battle of Quebec. The last 
five of these eight leaflets illustrate the original mate- 
rial in which Irving, Bancroft, Prescott, Motley, and 
Parkman worked in the preparation of their histories. 

Every student of English literature, whether in this 
country or elsewhere, will mourn the death of Francis 
James Child, which occurred on the eleventh of this 
month. As an authority upon his chosen subject he was 
easily the first among American scholars, and as a teacher 
and scholar in the department of English studies his 
influence was probably greater than that of any other 
American specialist of his generation. His professorial 
connection with Harvard University, his alma mater, 
dates from 1851, and was continued unbroken for 
forty-five years. If we reckon from the time of the 
tutorship which immediately followed upon his gradua- 
tion, we may credit him with an even half-century of 
educational work in the University. He was seventy- 
one years old at the time of his death. His greatest 
work is the monumental " English and Scottish Popular 
Ballads," of which the first volume appeared in 1883, 
and which has been continued down to the present time, 
eight or nine volumes altogether being produced. 

Whenever an Englishman of any prominence dies, 
Canon Rawnsley is promptly on hand with an obituary 
poem, usually a sonnet. The tribute to the late Lady 
Tennyson, in " The Academy," derives a peculiar interest 
from the fact that it was in the vicarage of Canon 
Rawnsley's father that the poet was wedded to Miss 
Emily Selwood. Here are the verses: 

" The Poet went his Pilot at the bar 

Gave him God- speed and turned toward the land 
Where lone upon the shore, with waving hand, 
Stood one who followed still her guiding star 
And watched it mount to heaven. Tho' sundered far, 
Its glory sent such gladness to the strand 
She waited patient, till the great command 
Came calling her to where the immortals are. 

"Oh ! sweet the memory of the Lincoln lane, 

And sweet the joy of Shiplake's marriage-bell, 

Sweet, happy hours in Aldworth's glade of pine, 
Or that loose- ordered garden known so well, 
But sweeter far, beyond all touch of pain, 
To feel thy love indissolubly thine ! "

AUTUMN LIST FROM MESSRS. COPELAND AND DAY 

CINDEE-PATH TALES, by WILLIAM LINDSEY, with cover design by JOHN SLOAN. Cloth, 
octavo, $1.00. 

In " Cinder- Path Tales " Mr. Lindsey has written stories of field and track which have technical consistency, 
and all the added coloring that a glowing imagination and a vivid memory of past enjoyment can give. He has 
succeeded wonderfully well in transferring to his pages the true atmosphere of the athletic field. Not alone the 
tangible surroundings of warm sunlight and free air, but its patient repression, its fun and philosophy, its disap- 
pointments and its glory.

EDGAR CHAMBERLIN. Two vols., cloth, octavo, 75 cents each. 

For nine years the " Listener " column in the Evening Transcript has been one of the literary institutions of

Ian Maclaren's first long novel. The scene is " Drumtochty," and many of the characters in " Beside the Bonnie Brier 
Bush" and " In the Days of Auld Lang Syne " reappear in its pages. It tells the story of a strong and simple love. It fur- 
nishes material for a story full of delightful situations in which the author's power to move the reader's sympathies and to 
appeal to his sense of humor is as great as ever. 

FOUR BOOKS OF FICTION.

tions by FRANK BRANGWYN. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
A collection of sea stories by such well-known authors as S. R.

erary quality which is unusual in works of this character. 

A PURITAN'S WIFE. 

By MAX PEMBERTON. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
This new novel by the author of " An Impregnable City " and " The 
Little Huguenot " will meet with a warm reception. It is full of adven-

THE BRONTES AND THEIR CIRCLE. 

Edited by CLEMENT K. SHORTER and Dr. W. ROBERTSON NICOLL. With Portraits. Large 12mo, cloth, 

about 500 pages, $2.50. 

Mr. Clement K. Shorter is probably to-day the greatest living authority on the Brontes. It will contain a great deal of 
new matter and many heretofore unpublished letters referring to the Brontes and their friends. Since Mrs. Gaskell's " Life 
of Charlotte Bronte," there has been no book written about the Brontes that can compare in interest with this work. It will 
also contain a number of unpublished portraits. 

NOTABLE BOOKS OF BIOGRAPHY. AND MEMOIRS. 
MY LONG LIFE. 

An Autobiography. By MARY COWDEN CLARKE. Illus- 
trated. Small 8vo, $2.00. 
Mrs. Clarke, the author of "Concordance to Shakespeare" and 

many other books, was a daughter of the celebrated musician Vincent 

No vello. Her recollections include so many of the notable literary and 

musical people of the last century that every page is interesting. Both 

Charles Lamb and Leigh Hunt she knew intimately. Her story is told 

in a charmingly artless manner which is very delightful.

By A. J. C. HARE. Illustrated with 145 Woodcuts and 18 

Photogravures. 2 vols. 8vo, cloth, $7.50. 

This autobiography of the author of "Walks in Rome" and many

England and elsewhere who are not only worth knowing but who have 
now come to be looked upon as celebrities. 



ESSAYS ON BOOKS AND CULTURE. 

By HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE. 16mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.25. 
Mr. Mabie occupies a unique place among present-day writers as 
an interpreter of literature. While all classes of readers will find varied 
delight in reading his work, he is especially a literary guide and inspira- 
tion to the young student, and no better book could be put into the 
hands of a beginner in literature than the volume of Essays which is 
now published. 

ADELINE, COUNTESS SCHIMMELMANN. 

With numerous Illustrations. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
This is a remarkable book by one of the most remarkable women of 
the day. Rather than remain all her life at court, she preferred to take 
up the cares of missionary work in the "back courts," and has become 
widely known as an advocate of reforms among the poorer classes, nota- 
bly prisoners, drunkards, etc. Her mission in life was one of religion 
and of human pity, and for vicissitudes of a tragical sort her life was 
well-nigh unexampled in recent times.

Theology in McCormick Theological Seminary, with an 
Introduction by the Rev. JOHN DEWiTT, D.D., LL.D. 
lo'mo, pp. 344, f 1.00. 

" I know no better outline than this one. The author's knowledge 
of the sources and literature of the subject is exceptionally large. The 
conception of history which dominates his book is the true conception. 
He holds that the historical movement is vital and organic. His work 
merits a wide circulation and faithful study." Prom the Introduction, 
by Dr. De Witt. 

AMERICAN PRESBYTERIANISM,

TERSON, D.D., LL.D. 16mo, pp. 132, 50 cents net. 
Dr. Patterson writes in a bright, incisive style, giving life 
and reality to the statistics he presents of the numerical growth 
of Presby terianism in all its branches and in comparison with 
the other various Christian denominations. This little book 
is full of meat. Its interest and value are in inverse propor- 
tion to its size. 

"HE IS NOT HERE": THE RESURRECTION 
OF CHRIST. 

By Rev. J. H. BROOKES, D.D. 16mo, pp. 170, 75 cents.

importance cannot be over estimated. The credibility and 
competency of the witnesses to our Lord's resurrection are 
fully established. Their testimony is minutely examined and 
shown to be conclusive. The cavils and counter-arguments 
of infidels and opposers are met and refuted. We commend the 
book as containing in a small compass an excellent exposition 
and defense of this important and fundamental doctrine.

fully felt by those who have to do with congregational or denominational 
business, of whatever denomination, but especially of those holding the 
Presbyterian System." The United Presbyterian (Pittsburg, Pa.). 

FAITH BUILDING. 

By Rev. WILLIAM P. MERRILL. 18mo, pp. 78, 50 cents.

able character. The author portrays the home life in a man- 
ner to strikingly bring out the advantages of a sound Chris- 
tian training, and the illustrations serve to deeply impress the 
story.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



GENIUS AND DEGENERATION. 

A Study in Psychology. By Dr. WILLIAM HIBSCH. With a 
Preface by Prof. Dr. E. MENDEL. Translated from the 
second edition of the German work. Uniform with " De- 
generation." Large 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

In his now famous book, Dr. Nordau startled the reading world by his 
cry of " Degeneration "; Dr. Hirsch opposes his conclusions by demon- 
strating the difference between "Genius" and " Degeneration," and 
analyzing the social, literary, and artistic manifestations of the day dis- 
passionately and with a wealth of suggestive illustrations. In a brilliant 
explanation of the psychology of genius he shows that Lombroso and 
Nordau make no distinction between scientific genius based upon hard 
work and artistic genius ; nor between genius and talent. He points to 
Goethe as an example of a perfectly developed genius. He answers spe- 
cifically Nordau's claim that this is an age of hysterical disorder, and 
after an extended, brilliant, and informing discussion of Art and Insan- 
ity, in which he shows himself a confirmed Wagnerian, he summarizes 
his conclusions by absolutely declining to accept Nordau's point of view. 
The field which he traverses is too broad to be measured in this note, 
but it is safe to say that the book is one which must be read by every 
reader of Nordau, and should be read by every intelligent person who 
wishes to understand the spirit of his time and the lessons which history 
teaches the psychologist. 

Ninth Edition. 

DEGENERATION. 

By Prof. MAX NOBDATI. Translated from the second edition 
of the German work. With Index. 8vo, cloth, $3.50. 

WHEN WILLIAM IV. WAS KING. 

By JOHN ASHTON, author of " Social Life in the Reign of 
Queen Anne," etc. With 47 Illustrations. 8vo. cloth, $3 50. 
In this entertaining volume of social and political history and per- 
sonal anecdotes Mr. Ashton sketches the manners and customs of the 
time when the first passenger railway was opened and steam navigation 
began to be general. Like a modern Pepys, although not a contempo- 
rary of his characters, he sketches the subjects of interest in the reign 
of the sailor king, pictures the social aspects, and introduces us to the 
notable personages of a most interesting time. 

WHAT IS ELECTRICITY? 

By JOHN TKOWBBIDGE, S.D., Rumford Professor and Lec- 
turer on the applications of Science to the Useful Arts, Har- 
vard University. Vol. 76, International Scientific Series. 
Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Professor Trowbridge's long experience both as an original investigator 
and as a teacher imparts a peculiar value to this important work. Find- 
ing that no treatise could be recommended which answers the question, 
" What is Electricity ? " satisfactorily, he has explained in a popular 
way the electro-magnetic theory of light and heat, and the subject of 
periodic currents and electric waves, seeking an answer for his titular 
question in the study of the transformations of energy and a considera- 
tion of the hypotheses of movements in the ether. As modern applica- 
tions of electricity illustrate the great subject of the transformation of 
energy, the author has simplified forms of apparatus and methods of 
exhibiting new phenomena. 

THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD.

Smith College, Member of the Graduate Seminary in Child 
Study, University of California. Vol. 35, International Ed- 
ucation Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The object of the present work is to bring together in a systematic, 
pedagogical form what is known regarding the development of infant 
children, so far as the facts have any bearing upon early education. K 
contains the chapters on Perception, Emotion, Memory, Imagination, 
and Consciousness. Another volume will follow, completing the work, 
and discussing the subjects of Judgment, Learning to Talk, Activity, 
Moral Sense, Character, Morbid Tendencies, Selfhood and Personality.

Mr. Anstey's original and impressive story has called from the London 
Bookman the comment that Hawthorne or Poe might have chosen such

THE EXTENSIONS OF LITERARY 
ACTIVITY. 

In spite of all that has of late been written 
upon the subject, it is still a difficult matter for 
the occidental to realize the immense transfor- 
mation that recent years have wrought in the 
realm of the Mikado. The old prepossessions 
are so strong upon us that we still instinctively 
class the Japanese with the other orientals, and 
are slow to recognize the fact that their newly- 
acquired culture and civilization have at last 
fairly brought them within the limits of the 
Western world and its intellectual comity. 
These reflections have often been suggested to 
us of late, and are suggested anew by the read- 
ing of a " Summary of Current Japanese Lit- 
erature " published in a recent issue of " The 
Japan Daily Mail." We cannot read such a 
summary without a deepening of the feeling 
that the modern Japanese are indeed " men and 
brothers," that our intellectual problems are 
also theirs, and that we may enjoy an intelligent 
and sympathetic share in their struggle for de- 
velopment. When we read, for example, that 
a list of recent translations into Japanese in- 
cludes Professor Westermark's " Evolution of 
Marriage," " The Origin of Species," and the 
" Kritik der Reinen Vernunft," we may won- 
der at the process of reproducing, say, the 
transcendental a3sthetic of Kant in a language 
of agglutinative type, but we must accept the 
fact that a people who can translate and read 
such books is one that cannot be classed with 
the inferior races of mankind. 

It was, of course, through translations that the 
Japanese of the new era had to get the begin- 
nings of modern culture. Among many work- 
ers in this field, Nakamura Keiu and Fuku- 
zawa Yukichi are named as pioneers. For the 
first fifteen years or so of the Meiji period, 
"translations good and bad, of well-known 
foreign works in all the principal book- shops 
crowded out the old Japanese and Chinese 
works hitherto in such request." Then came 
a sort of national reaction, and a number of 
men set to producing original literature of a 
lighter sort. A single book by Yano Fumio is 
said to have " brought him in a small fortune," 
Tsubouchi Shoyo was the " father of modern 
novelists," and wrote books with such titles as 



178 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



" A Conjugal Mirror," " A Dream about the 
Future," and "Incidents in the Life of Caesar." 
One novelist of this earlier period is described 
as " noted for his polished style and powerful 
grouping of incidents "; another is said to have 
"discussed the relation of the sexes and blended 
the elements of romance found in foreign works 
of fiction so as to suit Japanese readers "; while 
a third, " an ardent admirer of Zola," was dis- 
tinguished by "his earnest advocacy of the 
amalgamation of the colloquial and the written 
styles." Just such things as these might be 
said of Mr. Bret Harte, Mr. Thomas Hardy, 
and Robert Louis Stevenson. " The demand 
for novels was so great that new editions 
of numbers of almost forgotten works were 
published, and there sprang into existence a 
' Novel Publishing Company,' which, while the 
rage lasted, drove a roaring trade, and a novel 
publishing magazine, which obtained a wide cir- 
culation." How exactly these statements would 
apply to recent aspects of book production in 
London or New York ; with what fellow-feeling 
do we read how, after " a certain amount of 
satiety on the part of readers, the ordinary love- 
story gave place to the detective story, which 
was rendered popular by Kuroiwa Ruiko!" 
Read for this strange name Gaboriau or Conan 
Doyle, and the parallel is obvious. 

The present era in Japanese letters, we are 
told, " is the age of newspapers and magazines." 
In this periodical literature, we find discussions 
of such subjects as the translations of technical 
terms, the incompetency of translators in gen- 
eral, the practice of composing verses in the 
Chinese language, the degradation of literature 
by the commercial spirit, the excessive preva- 
lence of fiction in the periodicals, and the rash 
but amusing cocksureness of youthful critics 
of literature. A writer on the last of these 
subjects is particularly severe. " With no ad- 
equate knowledge of English, men compose 
treatises on the comparative merits of English 
poets ; raw students of German express a pref- 
erence for one German poet rather than an- 
other. These things are a disgrace to the whole 
Japanese literary world." Another writer in- 
veighs in hearty fashion against magazine 
poetry. One of his remarks leads us to suspect 
that Mr. Stephen Crane has his Japanese ana- 
logue. " As for the verses known as Icyoshi 
(crazy verses) they are like the squibs let off 
by children. They create a momentary sensa- 
tion, but they will sink into lasting oblivion." 
Still another writer complains that since the 
conclusion of the war there has been a " want 



of ardor in literary matters." " It shows itself 
in the world of romance, the modern novelist 
expecting to effect with his forty or fifty pages 
what in former days it took five or six times 
that number to accomplish." 

The book-weariness of the modern world 
appears to be felt in Japan, as it is elsewhere ; 
and those among us who in their more gloomy 
moods are inclined to think the invention of 
printing an evil will read with approval the 
following summary of a Japanese discussion of 
this subject : 

" Facilities for publishing books are now so great that 
literary tyros are encouraged to inflict their crude ideas 
on the reading world. The methods used for self- 
advertisement in recent times are of a most objection- 
able kind. Authors entirely unknown to fame publish 
books containing their own photographs. Little children 
are encouraged to send literary contributions to such 
papers as the ' Shonen Zasshi,' and then the photograph 
of the person considered the best youthful composer is 
supplied to the subscribers. The bad effects of all this 
fuss on the minds of young people must be patent to 
everybody. In the old days when every character that 
a book contained had to be carved, only those that had 
something important to say ventured to publish a book, 
and booksellers took no leaps in the dark." 

Some interesting statistics are devoted to the 
periodical press of Japan. During the past 
five years, the country had an average of nearly 
eight hundred newspapers and magazines. Of 
these the average circulation has varied from 
about 250 copies in 1890 to about 450 in 1894. 
But the most surprising thing about these sta- 
tistics is the revelation they afford of the brevity 
of the life enjoyed by a Japanese magazine or 
newspaper. Over half the entire number for 
any given year give up the unequal struggle 
(which is not surprising when we look at the 
circulation statistics) and are replaced by am- 
bitious new ventures, for the most part destined, 
no doubt, to an equally ephemeral life. For 
example, 802 periodicals are reported at the 
close of 1893. During 1894, no less than 506 
of them were discontinued, yet no fewer than 
518 new periodicals sprang up to fill their 
places, making the total 814, and once more 
vindicating the poet who tells us that " hope 
springs eternal in the human breast." Japanese 
periodical literature is evidently in the " Chap 
Book " and " Philistine " stage of its develop- 
ment, and might give points to the hopeful 
youths who are now engaged in swelling the list 
of American periodicals. 

This record of aimless and unsuccessful ex- 
periment does not, however, tell the whole story 
of contemporary Japanese literature. We get 
a very different view of the matter from such 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

announcements as the two that follow. A his- 
tory of the late war with China has been planned 
under government auspices, and is expected to 
require five years of work and fifty thousand 
yen of money. The Imperial University has 
undertaken the still greater task of preparing 
an exhaustive history of Japan, and a committee 
of sixteen scholars is now at work collecting, 
classifying, and editing the voluminous mate- 
rials needed for such a work. The writer of 
our summary notes also the urgent need of 
a comprehensive dictionary or encyclopaedia 
of Japanese literature. Works of this class 
already in existence are little more than cata- 
logues of titles, and " there is no country in the 
world where the names of books are more mis- 
leading than they are in Japan." Other mat- 
ters are touched upon in the highly interesting 
article which has served us as a text upon the 
present occasion, but enough has already been 
reproduced to convey a distinct idea of the con- 
dition of literary endeavor in our neighbor- 
empire of the West, and to show that men meet 
with the same intellectual problems everywhere, 
whatever the skies above their heads. 



TWO POETS. 



ROSSETTI. 

A strange life and a dreamful life he led, 
Strange in its methods, dreamful in its moods; 
He seeks occult and vissionary woods, 

By vague elusive things inhabited; 

His Orphic soul, imagination-sped, 
Betakes itself to voiceful solitudes, 
Where emulous love imperially broods, 

Fond, ardor-flushed, superb, and passion-fed. 

Song-sound uniquely volumed he obtains 
From sources alien to his native speech; 

Masterful quivering cadences he gains, 

Like thrill and throb of billows on the beach; 

The splendor of his rhythmic sweep remains 
Within and yet beyond our dazzled reach. 

POE. 

He is the poet of the weird and drear: 

For things uncanny he awakes and calls; 

He sits with midnight in deserted halls, 
Amid the hush and imminence of fear; 
He walks where foul shapes hover hugely near, 

Where death's chill step his shuddering soul appalls; 

He sees in caves, round hollow waterfalls, 
Slim serpents their hot hissing crests uprear. 

In visions vague, disconsolate, and grim, 

He roams lone lands where wailing winds blow shrill, 

And the gaunt ghost of desolation dwells; 
With ebon croak the Raven comes to him; 

Then, music-tranced, he hears the throb, the thrill, 
The revel and the rapture of the Bells. 

A. T. SCHUMAN. 



THOSE A U AS PROSE WRITER. 

Thoreau's prose writings, as published in com- 
plete form in eleven volumes, make it for the first 
time possible to come to any clear and full judg- 
ment concerning his character and place as a writer 
of artistic prose. What is Thoreau's best work? 
What is his rank among artists? If his life had 
been prolonged, would he have done better work 
than he actually accomplished? To these and the 
like interesting questions it is now possible to give 
some definite answer. Let us begin with the first, 
and consider what is Thoreau's best and most char- 
acteristic expression of himself. 

" Walden " is usually pointed out as Thoreau's 
masterpiece. But while this is certainly a very 
brilliant piece of writing, and has a unity too often 
lacking in his other works, it yet affords but a slight 
clue to the real Thoreau ; for here he addresses an 
inquiring public desirous of knowing in detail his 
hut-life by Walden pond, and in the whole course 
of the book he keeps this audience in mind, goes 
out to meet it, and by a most conspicuously popu- 
lar style adapts himself to it. In lightsome mood, 
and with many a satirical stroke and humorous 
touch, he tells this Walden story. What can be 
finer, as a playful image, than his complaint that the 
"Iron Horse," "whose ear-rending neigh is heard 
throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling 
Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed 
off all the woods on Walden shore." But with all 
its excellence of style, "Walden" is comparatively 
superficial in both matter and manner. If we would 
find Tboreau's deeper self, we must search elsewhere. 
Let us look then to the Journals, as printed in 
the four volumes entitled "Spring," "Summer," 
"Autumn," and " Winter." Here Thoreau writes 
merely for himself and to please himself, and so re- 
veals his true self. The " journalizing," he says, is 
" an effort to expose my innermost and richest wares 
to light." The Journals are then, I take it, most im- 
portant documents to help us in fully understanding 
and appreciating the real Thoreau and his art. Here 
we find, indeed, much treasure, both silver and gold ; 
but also some base metal, both brass and pewter. 
As a specimen of his basest metal, we extract a few 
lines from his profuse and foolish musings on a big 
toadstool : 

" Such growths ally our age to those earlier periods 
which geology reveals. I wondered if it had not some 
relation to the skunk, though not in odor, yet in its color 
and the general impression it made. It suggests a veg- 
etative force which may almost make man tremble for 
his dominion. It carries me back to the era of the for- 
mation of the coal measures, the age of the Saurus and 
the Pliosaurus, and when bull-frogs were as big as bulls.

muggy night the surface of the earth is mildewed. The 
mold is the flower of humid darkness and ignorance. 
The pyramids and other monuments of Egypt are a vast 
mildew or toad-stool which have met with no light of day 
sufficient to waste them away."

dering. And such slipshod thought is not infrequent 
in the Journals, though often in a measure redeemed 
hy accuracy and purity of style. We have met with 
but one bad error in style, and this is so ludicrously 
bad that it is worth quoting. Describing the win- 
tergreen blossom, Thoreau says, " It is a very pretty 
little chandelier of a flower, fit to adorn the forest 
floor." Possibly Thoreau's slight acquaintance with 
ball-rooms made him overlook the fact that chan- 
deliers do not usually adorn floors. 

But it is very pleasant to the patient searcher 
among the Journals to find amid the baser metals 
nuggets of purest gold ; here and there he comes 
upon passages of descriptive literature of the high- 
est order. Take, for instance, the description of 
the felling and dismembering of a giant pine by the 
lumberman. We can quote only the conclusion of 
this woodland tragedy. The tree felled, the chopper 
" Has measured it with his ax and marked off the 
small logs it will make. It is lumber. . . . When the 
fish-hawk in the spring revisits the banks of the Mus- 
ketaquid, he will circle in vain to find his accustomed 
perch, and the hen-hawk will mourn for the pines lofty 
enough to protect her brood. . . . I hear no knell tolled, 
I see no procession of mourners in the streets or the 
woodland aisles. The squirrel has leaped to another 
tree, the hawk has circled farther off, and has now set- 
tled upon a new eyrie, but the woodman is preparing to 
lay his ax at the root of that also." 

This has genuine quality, as has also the following 
description of a bobolink's song : 

" I hear the note of a bobolink concealed in the top 
of an apple-tree behind me. Though this bird's full 
strain is ordinarily somewhat trivial, this one appears 
to be meditating a strain as yet. unheard in meadow or 
orchard. Paulo majora canamus. He is just touching 
the strings of his theorbo, his glassichord, his water 
organ, and one or two notes globe themselves and fall 
in liquid bubbles from his harp within a vase of liquid 
melody, and when he lifted it out the notes fell like 
bubbles from the trembling strings. Methinks they are 
the most liquidly sweet and melodious sounds I ever 
heard. They are as refreshing to my ear as the first dis- 
tant tinkling and gurgling of a rill to a thirsty man. 
Oh, never advance farther in your art; never let us hear 
your full strain, sir ! But away he launches, and the 
meadow is all bespattered with melody. ... It is the 
foretaste of such strains as never fell on mortal ears, to 
hear which we should rush to our doors and contribute 
all that we possess and are." 

Where will you find anything finer in its way than 
this ? It is truly, like the bobolink's, a large and 
noble strain. And many of Thoreau's descriptions 
of notes of birds and animals have a very rare qual- 
ity, as when he writes of the cock's clarion, the 
blackbird's song, and the bullfrog's trump. 

To show once more what Thoreau in his best 
mood can do, look at this little landscape sketch : 

" The air is clear as if a cool, dewy brush had swept 
the meadows of all haze. A liquid coolness invests them, 
as if their midnight aspect were suddenly revealed to 
midday. The mountain outline is remarkably distinct, 
and the intermediate earth appears more than usually 
scooped out like a vast saucer sloping upwards to its 
sharp mountain rim. The mountains are washed in air." 



This picture of pellucid air is remarkably artistic. 
Nought is florid or forced, but the expression is sin- 
gularly close, clear, and grand. The phrase, " The 
mountains are washed in air," touches the sublime ; 
it strikes the keynote of a Nature hymn. For the 
moment Thoreau soars the empyrean with eagle 
sweep. 

We confess to enjoying such slight but exquisite 
sketches as these from the Journals far more than 
the elaborate and conscious efforts in " Walden." 
" Walden " is exoteric, the Journals are esoteric. 
" Walden " has not the deep seriousness, the solemn 
rapture, which pervades these records of daily life. 
Here we see more clearly than elsewhere how 
strongly Thoreau is thrilled and uplifted by nature's 
beauty. This " vision " affects him more " deeply 
and powerfully " than aught else. Hence he is a 
haunter of fields and rivers, of woods and hills ; 
and, far withdrawing from the roar of modern me- 
chanic life, he would " lurk," he says, " in crystal- 
line thought, like the trout under verdurous banks, 
where stray mankind should only see my bubble 
coming to the surface." 

But though Thoreau often rises to rapture in his 
marvellously sensitive response to nature, he yet 
never attains real poetic expression. He has the 
raw material in plenty ; but, as Emerson says, 
" thyme and marjoram are not yet honey." Thoreau 
regards the art of metre, rhyme, and rhythm as too 
much akin to artifice. He thinks that the " very 
scheme and form " of poetry is adopted at " a sac- 
rifice of vital truth and poetry," and he refuses to 
make this sacrifice. 

Thoreau has been called the " poet-naturalist." 
We have seen that he is not a poet, and it is equally 
plain that he is not a naturalist. Throughout his 
Journals, Thoreau iterates and reiterates that he is 
not a scientist, and that science has no vital interest 
for him. Indeed, the spirit of science is in the 
directest opposition to Thoreau's ; for while science 
does away with the personal equation, Thoreau mag- 
nifies it. He values nature not as a source of mere 
knowledge for its own sake, but as a fount of de- 
light and inspiration which pours through his whole 
being. In all his close observation of nature, he 
seeks, not information, but beauty and sympathy. 
" In what book," he asks, " is this world and its 
beauty described ? Who has plotted the steps toward 
the discovery of beauty ? You must be in a different 
state from common. Your greatest success will be 
simply to conceive that such things are, and you 
will have no communication to make to the Royal 
Society." Thoreau thus shows an artist's dislike of 
cold, unimpressionable science. He desires above 
all things to feel deeply the supernal beauty of na- 
ture, and to give large expression of this emotion in 
living prose ; in short, Thoreau is preeminently an 
artist, and in particular an impressionist of the open- 
air school. Out-of-doors is the subject of his art ; 
there is his studio, and, indeed, also his home, his 
theatre, his university, and his church. 

But Thoreau is not equally open to all sides of 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



181 



nature. He lived for some time by the sea, and 
often visited its shore ; yet, so far as we may judge 
from his writings, he was not much affected by the 
wondrous beauty and majesty of old ocean. He 
wandered over Cape Cod ; he made excursions to 
the White Mountains, to the Maine woods, and to 
Canada ; but his writings thereabout and Thoreau 
is very faithful to himself in all his writing are 
quite juiceless and uninspired. But let Thoreau once 
set foot on the well-beloved fields of Concord, walk 
in its forests, glide along its smooth-flowing river, 
and he at once utters a fresh, deep, and strong note. 
Even Monadnock and Wachusett thrill him chiefly 
as seen from Concord. All that is best in Thoreau's 
life and art centres in rural Concord ; he is its lit- 
erary Genius loci ; he broods over its every phase, 
and voices his observation and meditation in sen- 
tences full of rarest insight and clearest beauty. 
Away from Concord he is ill at ease, and only par- 
tially receptive of the divine message of nature. " I 
am afraid," he says, " to travel much, or to famous 
places, lest it might completely dissipate the mind. 
Then I am sure that what we observe at home, if 
we observe anything, is of more importance than 
what we observe abroad. The far-fetched is of the 
least value." 

Thoreau's writings show several styles. We dis- 
tinguish five. First is the adolescent, diffuse, ro- 
mantic style of " The Week." This work we find 
intensely wearisome in its smooth discursiveness 
and sophomoric sententiousness. Second, there is 
the dry, matter-of-fact style of the " Cape Cod," 
" Maine Woods," and " Yankee in Canada " narra- 
tives. Here he is objective and reportorial. Thoreau 
himself speaks of the " Canada story " as simply a 
" report " of what he saw, and as " not worth the 
time I took to tell it." This is, perhaps, too harsh 
a judgment ; but still, all his stories of travel, though 
touched with a lucid simplicity, are yet on the whole 
quite meagre and commonplace. Again, we have 
the style of " Walden," brilliant, sketchy, charming, 
but never satisfying, because it both reveals and 
conceals. And again, we have the frank, plain, but 
often noble style of the best parts of the Journals 
and Letters. This writing is very concise and clear, 
often limpid, and generally slow of movement. 
However, the pine-tree episode, from which we have 
quoted, has much the swing of " Walden "; and in 
the Journals we find also the adolescent style, and 
even the dry narrative style, as in the account of 
the White Mountain trip. Lastly, we have the per- 
fectly sound, sensible, sober style of the essay on 
" Wild Apples." This is a very delightful bit of 
prose, and, I think, quite the best complete work 
that Thoreau has left us. It shows that he could in 
his latter days give a unity of development and a 
mature expression, mellowed, withal, by a thor- 
oughly genial humor a humor wholly free from 
that satiric acidity which gives a bad taste to so 
much of Thoreau's production. The catalogue of 
the kinds of wild apples reminds one of Charles 
Lamb. 



With whom shall we compare Thoreau as a 
painter of nature ? Not with White of Selborne, 
for White is primarily a scientist, while Thoreau is 
above all and before all an artist. Not with Ruskin, 
for though both are artists, they are very diverse ; 
Ruskin sees nature through the medium of the Bible 
and Turner, but Thoreau could allow neither priest 
nor painter to be his interpreter, and so he felt him- 
self radically out of tune with the great art critic. 
And further, the rich and cloying style of Ruskin 
is altogether unlike the crystalline simplicity of 
Thoreau's best work. In his mind and art, Thoreau 
is much nearer to Wordsworth than to either White 
or Ruskin. Both Wordsworth and Thoreau are 
entirely individual and direct in their approach 
to nature, seeking at all times an unprepossessed 
impression, which they would express in the sim- 
plest and freest art, Wordsworth, in prosaic poe- 
try ; Thoreau, in poetic prose. For both, nature is 
a source not merely of aesthetic but also of ethical 
inspiration, though Wordsworth has a mature 
strength and poise, an abiding rock-like solidity, 
quite foreign to Thoreau. Both are local in their 
sentiment, the Lake country being to Wordsworth 
what Concord was to Thoreau. For a particular 
comparison of work, read the description of the bob- 
olink's song, before mentioned, and then read these 
lines of Wordsworth on a nightingale's song : 

" O Nightingale ! thou surely art 
A creature of a fiery heart ; 
These notes of thine they pierce and pierce ; 
Tumultuous harmony and fierce ! 
Thou sing'st as if the God of wine 
Had helped thee to a Valentine ; 
A song in mockery and despite 
Of shades, and dews, and silent Night ; 
And steady bliss, and all the loves 
Now sleeping in these peaceful Groves." 

The art of Wordsworth is here more perfect and 
eloquent than Thoreau's, but Thoreau excels in inti- 
macy with nature and in fulness and closeness of 
expression. Thoreau is the more intense and thor- 
ough student of nature, and if he could have put 
his impression of the bobolink's song into adequate 
poetic form it would have been a nobler piece than 
Wordsworth's lines to a nightingale. Thoreau's 
matter is superior, but his manner is inferior. 

What, then, is Thoreau's rank as literary artist ? 
And has he, indeed, any permanent place in litera- 
ture ? We can with all safety predict that the greater 
part is perishable. It is plain enough that " The 
Week," the stories of the Cape Cod, Maine, and 
Canada excursions, and most of the "Miscellanies," 
are perishable third-rate work. " Walden " is cer- 
tainly a brilliant piece of its kind, but that not the 
highest ; and in the Journals we have a sketch-book 
containing some very beautiful studies, but no 
finished work. However, in my judgment the essay 
on " Wild Apples " shows Thoreau at his best, and 
in his true function ; but even this needs pruning, 
and the theme is rather small and narrow. What 
an essay Thoreau could have given us on Bird-song ! 
It would have been a classic. If Thoreau had lived

his allotted span, he might have produced some won- 
derfully fine work on such lines ; but as it is, we 
can only lament the unfulfilled promise of an artist 
uniquely great in animal and landscape word paint- 
ing. Thoreau was undoubtedly one of those rarest 
visitors to our planet a genius ; and, what is more, 
a genius true to himself, who never swerved to the 
right or left in following out his bent. As such, 
appreciation of him is bound to grow, and that de- 
spite the incompleteness and immaturity of his 
actual performance. We may say with confidence 
that Thoreau's place, though small, is secure and 
permanent ; he occupies a distinct but minor niche 
in the eternal Pantheon of Art.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

AN AMERICAN ENDOWED THEATRE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The arguments that favor a theatre subsidized and 
controlled by the State can, I suppose, all be used in 
favor of an endowed theatre; and of course an endowed 
theatre is the only one of the two which at present seems 
in any way possible in America. To the sojourner on 
the continent of Europe the subsidized national theatre 
seems to be one of the most effective instruments of 
popular aesthetic education which could be devised, and 
the total lack of anything equivalent to it in America 
to be one of the most distressing and humiliating de- 
fects in our civilization. The good that such establish- 
ments do here is almost in every respect as patent and 
appreciable as the good accomplished in America by 
endowed libraries and universities, and it is difficult to 
conjure up objections of any weight to the proposition 
that an endowed theatre in any large American city, 
which should set itself to follow strictly the lines of 
policy adopted by such an institution as the Theatre 
Franc.ais in Paris, or the three national theatres in the 
city of Munich, would be there just as beneficent and 
effective an instrument of culture as here. These reflec- 
tions occur to me after having witnessed recently in 
the Hof Theater in Munich as impressive and adequate 
a performance of " Lear " as is likely to be heard by 
any American in a generation which so rarely hears such 
masterpieces of tragedy as " Lear " and " Macbeth." 
Not that the King Lear of Herr Schneider and the 
Cordelia of Fraulein Dandier were masterpieces of 
tragic acting, but that the entire performance from the 
highest part to the lowest was an example of sincere and 
earnest art, such as could be possible only where the 
influence of the box-office is practically eliminated, and 
where the ambitions and jealousies of " stars," the silly 
centring of interest upon the personality of the actors 
and actresses, and the clamor of the galleries, are all 
alike considerations that can safely be disregarded. A 
national theatre which in the course of a fortnight can 
offer some six or seven operas, mostly by Wagner, 
Beethoven, and Mozart, " Lear " and " Hamlet," and 
Goethe's " Tasso," besides comedies and lighter pieces, 
as an average repertory, might well claim to serve as a 
model for our American endowed theatre when we 
have it ! FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER.

WHAT CONSTITUTES PROOF? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The facts pointed out under the heading " Dogmatic 
Philology " by a correspondent in your issue of Sept. 1 
are worthy of emphasis. They warn us against absolute 
dicta unless we are safely within the confines of careful 
definition, a warning that to my mind your correspondent 
might well have heeded. The sentences quoted by him 
in defense of his criticism range from Homer to Mat- 
thew Arnold, and prove, as I think, either too much or 
too tittle. 

Does not the writer assume that rhetoric never 
changes? Does he not accept an idiom in one language 
as evidence of acceptable usage in another tongue? 
What pertinency is there otherwise to his quotations 
from Sophocles, Chauteaubriand, or even from Spenser 
and Milton? Words become obsolete. May not usages 
of phrase? Is the rhetoric of a given epoch other than 
the usage of the best writers of that period ? In many 
respects we may not write as did Spenser or even Mil- 
ton. Historical rhetoric is an instructive and fascinat- 
ing study, but we cannot use its data unquestioned in 
our assaults upon the rulings of rhetoricians. If the 
text-books give instructions contrary to present usage, 
the evidence is ready to our hand and any critic may 
collect it. There is great need that someone should set 
forth convincing evidence in regard to many points of 
rhetorical usage. 

But arguments that muster the data of past centuries 
as proof of present usage are not so disappointing as 
those that rely upon unsupported data, the merest 
chances of composition, for the justification of destruc- 
tive criticism. What can we not prove if we cull an 
expression here and there from the books of accepted 
authors ! In one instance, at least, Hawthorne has used 
whomsoever as subject of a finite verb because of the 
malign influence of a neighboring preposition. Addison 
and Irving wrote phrasings that authors of to-day avoid. 
The evidence of acceptable usage must come from the 
works of such writers, but the laws of evidence obtain 
here as elsewhere. Our text-books of rhetoric need 
searching criticism probably no other text-books are 
so unsatisfactory; but neither the evidence of historical 
usage nor that drawn from occasional usage by present 
writers much less the usage of foreign tongues is 
adequate for the determination of disputed points.

PROFESSOR Eduard Sievers, of the University of Leip-

pletion of a quarter century of service as a university 
professor. In honor of this occasion, twenty-three of 
his friends and former pupils have united in the pub- 
lication of a memorial volume, treating of subjects in the 
line of German and English languages and literatures. 
The contributors are scattered all over Europe, and 
there are several in America Professor Cook of Yale, 
Professor Hempl of Michigan University, Professor 
Hale of Schenectady, and Professor Karsteii of the Uni- 
versity of Indiana. Professor Sievers was born at Lip- 
poldsberg in 1850, studied at Leipzig and Berlin, was 
called as professor to Jena in 1871, to Tubingen in 
1876, to Halle in 1887, and to Leipzig in 1892. His 
foremost work has been done in the lines of Old Ger- 
man and Old English grammar and metre, and his best 
known book is probably the Anglo-Saxon grammar.

TRAVELS AND EXPLORATIONS IN NORTH- 
WESTERN AMERICA.* 



A canoe journey from Fort Wrangel, a port 
of entry for Alaska situated about six miles 
from the mouth of the Stikine River, to the 
Pelly Lakes and down the Yukon River to the 
Behring Sea, forms the subject of a very read- 
able volume entitled " Through the Subarctic 
Forest," by Mr. Warburton Pike. The first 
part of the journey lies chiefly along the route 
followed by the party sent out in 1887 by the 
Geological Survey Party of Canada ; but the 
country lying to the northeast of a line drawn 
from the north end of Frances Lake to the site 
of the Old Pelly Banks trading-post, partially 
traversed by Mr. Pike, may be said to have 
been hitherto absolutely new ground. Of this 
tract, which he was the first to explore, the 
author gives a rough sketch-map, probably of 
approximate accuracy. The only geographical 
discovery of any importance made by Mr. Pike 
was the rather negative one that the river drain- 
ing the Pelly Lakes, and marked as the Pelly 
on the maps drawn up from Indian reports, is 
not really entitled to be so considered, but is 
only a small tributary of a large river heading 
towards the northeast, and rising probably on 
the western slope of the Rockies. This latter 
stream Mr. Pike thinks is the Pelly proper. 
He dwells chiefly in his narrative on the Pelly 
and Liard district, which, though less remote, 
is far less known than the often-described coun- 
try of the Yukon and the Behring Sea. 

The craft in which Mr. Pike's journey was 
mainly made was a canoe built of light spruce 
on the Peterboro' model. Her dimensions were : 
18 feet length, 3 feet 6 inches beam, and 20 
inches depth, with a total weight of 130 Ibs.; 
and being a decided departure from local 
models, she was the subject of much ominous 
head-shaking and comment monitory and sar- 
castic on the part of canoeing wiseacres at Fort 
Wrangel. Her makers, however, as it proved, 
had builded even better than they knew ; for 
the little boat surpassed expectations. After a

journey of four thousand miles of rapid and often 
dangerous water, after long and rough portages 
on men's shoulders and on dog-sleds through two 
hundred miles of forest, she reached salt water 
again tight and stanch at the end of fifteen 
months, to battle with the storms and tides of the 
Behring Sea. " I doubt," says Mr. Pike, " if it 
would be possible to build a more suitable craft." 

The start from Wrangel up the Stikine was 
made early in July, 1892 ; and four days' rather 
arduous poling, paddling, wading, and pulling 
themselves up-stream by the bushes, brought 
the party to the great Stikine glacier. Klootch- 
man Canon, Telegraph Creek, Laketon, Syl- 
vester's Landing, were all passed in turn, after 
plenty of adventure and sight-seeing en route ; 
and on the 20th of September the Lower Liard 
Post was reached. Here the first fall of snow 
warned the voyageurs that their progress proper 
must soon be barred by the ice, and they pushed 
on to the Upper Post, where it was proposed 
to winter, arriving on the 18th of October. The 
winter months were passed in moose-hunting 
in the country to the west of the Dease and 
south of the Liard, in a mining or prospecting 
expedition (which does not seem to have 
" panned out " very favorably), and in hauling 
supplies and the canoe overland to Frances 
Lake. On the 18th of April the final start 
for the north and the Pelly River was made. 

The author's account of the remainder of the 
journey down the Pelly and the Yukon to 
Ikosmut, thence overland to the Kuskokvim 
River, down the Kuskokvim to the coast, along 
the coast (by canoe) to Nushagak, and thence 
by schooner to Unalaska is graphic and full 
of incident. One learns a good deal from him 
as to the condition of the Indians (of such, at 
least, as have come in pretty frequent contact 
with the Whites) of the far Northwest ; and 
the facts he offers do not, to put it mildly, re- 
dound to the credit of our civilization. It is 
mainly the old story of the red-man giving way 
to the white, acquiring and sinking under his 
vices, and falling through the various stages of 
disease and degradation into extinction. For 
him the white man's touch is too often as a 
leper's. Says the author : 

" I do n't believe the Indian was ever the noble crea- 
ture he has often been painted. We can only suppose 
that in time past he led a harmless existence, and un- 
consciously did his duty in the particular station of life 
to which he had been called; but, dress him up in the 
white man's clothes, feed him on bacon and flour, canned 
peaches and molasses, give him a few drinks of whiskey, 
and he becomes a despicable brute. He does not like 
being taken away from all these good things, and has a

profound contempt for the few true Indians who still 
make a living in the woods by trapping the precious fur." 

While hunting in the Liard and Dease re- 
gion, Mr. Pike encountered a band of Liard 
Indians typical semi-degenerates, who were 

in pitiful case : 

" Sickness was prevalent in the camp very few of 
the men were well enough to hunt moose, and they had 
come to the lake to be sure of making a living. A mel- 
ancholy spectacle the camp presented ; half a dozen pits 
in the snow lined with pine brush, a little more pine 
brush stuck up as a wind-break, and no other shelter 
from the weather. Lying in their blankets were the 
sick men, some of them evidently never to get up again 
dying among the moose hair and fish guts that were 
liberally scattered over everything; and outside the filth 
of the camp the ice-bound lake sparkled in the winter 
sunshine that always seems so full of health and strength. 
What was the matter with them all ? < Oh ! we 're 
always like this,' the chief explained, ' since the white 
men came into the country. In the old time my tribe 
was powerful; but now many of my people die every 
winter. Some children are born, but they are no good 
they die soon.' " 

Mr. Pike suggests that as a good deal of 
money is spent annually by Government on the 
Canadian Indians, it might be well to spare 
some of that money for this outlying district. 
A qualified doctor might at all events be sent 
thither " to patch up as best he might the rem- 
nants of the tribes of the Casca and Liard 
Indians, and prevent the spread of contagion." 
Above all things, urges Mr. Pike, let the man 
whose salary is paid be a doctor and not an 
Indian agent. Under present conditions, the 
end of these unfortunates seems near : 

" No surveys are wanted ; no reservations need be 
staked off; for, if the present state of affairs continues 
but a few more years, extinction will put every Indian 
beyond the limitation of the agent's reserve." 

Touching the natives on the Behring Sea 
coast, Mr. Pike observes that the damage done 
among them by the visits of the San Francisco 
whalers is already noticeable. A most flagrant 
case in point, that occurred a few years ago, 
caused a stir in the newspapers, but there was 
no official inquiry Government being appar- 
ently too busy looking after the fur seals to 
bother about the Innuits. It seems that a 
homeward-bound whaler put in at an island 
village off the coast, and succeeded in driving 
a lively trade with the natives, who were anx- 
ious to go in pursuit of the walrus which were 
then passing, and upon which they are depend- 
ent for their winter's supply of food. The bar- 
gains were struck quickly, and the schooner 
sailed away with the wealth of the village under 
her hatches leaving behind her, unfortu- 
nately, a couple of kegs of strong rum in part 
payment. The issue was natural: 



" By the time the natives had finished the rum and 
got over its effects, the walrus had passed, there was no 
supply of food put up for the winter, and ice was be- 
ginning to drift in the sea. . . . The next whaler that 
called at the island was able to take home an interesting 
collection of bones and skulls of the Esquimaux type to 
an ethnological institution; but there was no man, wo- 
man, or child, left alive on the rum-stricken island to 
tell the story of starvation and death." 

Mr. Pike appends to his narrative a chapter 
descriptive of the botanical and geological col- 
lections made in the course of his journey. 
The volume is acceptably illustrated, and there 
are two maps. 

Mr. Walter Dwight Wilcox's finely illus- 
trated volume, " Camping in the Canadian 
Rockies," contains some capital and timely de- 
scription of a magnificent region which, though 
still relatively unexplored and unmapped, must 
soon attract a large share of summer travel. 
Indeed, the tide is already setting somewhat 
strongly thitherward. During a period of four 
years the author has made camping and moun- 
taineering excursions into many of the wilder 
parts of the Rockies and the Selkirks, mak- 
ing a number of ascents notably of Mount 
Temple, the highest peak yet climbed, his 
chief local points of departure being Banff 
(the focal point of the Canadian National 
Park), Lake Louise, and the Glacier House, 
one of the two new hotels in the heart of the 
Selkirk Range. One needs only to skim the 
narratives (as abridged by our author) of the 
pioneers, Mackenzie, Hector, Milton, etc., to 
judge how the modern camper and mountaineer 
must appreciate, in the intervals of his arduous 
holiday relaxations, the comforts of these well- 
appointed hostelries. Mr. Wilcox has a very 
good descriptive style, easily surpassing his 
predecessors in this respect. A fair example 
is his picture of a falling avalanche on Mount 
Lefroy a peak which, it may be remembered, 
was the scene last summer of the tragic death 
of Mr. Philip Abbott, an estimable and prom- 
ising young man, whose Alpine experiences 
failed to ensure him against the perils of the 
Canadian Rockies. Says Mr. Wilcox : 

" I was standing at a point some two miles distant 
looking at this imposing mountain, when from the ver- 
tical ice wall a great fragment of the glacier, some three 
hundred feet thick and several times as long, broke away, 
and, turning slowly in mid-air, began to fall through 
the abyss. In a few seconds, amid continued silence, 
for the sound had not yet reached me, the great mass 
struck a projecting ledge of rock after a fall of some 
half thousand feet, and at the shock, as if by some inward 
explosion, the block was shivered into thousands of 
smaller fragments and clouds of white powdery ice. 
Simultaneously came the first thunder of the avalanche. 
The larger pieces led the way, some whirling around

in mid-air, others gliding down like meteors with long 
trains of snowy ice -dust trailing behind. The finer 
powered debris followed after, in a long succession of 
white streamers and curtains resembling cascades and 
waterfalls. The loud crash at the first great shock now 
developed into a prolonged thunder wherein were count- 
less lesser sounds of the smaller pieces of ice. It was 
like the sound of a great battle in which the sharp crack 
of rifles mingles with the roar of artillery. Leaping 
from ledge to ledge with ever increasing velocity, the 
large fragments at length reached the bottom of the 
precipice, while a long white train extended nearly the 
whole height of the grand mountain wall 2500 feet from 
base to top." 

While Mr. Wilcox was, during his several 
expeditions, chiefly " on pleasure bent," camp- 
ing, climbing, and photography being his espe- 
cial hobbies, he did a fair amount of actual 
exploring of the arduous pioneering kind ; and 
his book adds materially to our knowledge of 
the topography of the region visited. There 
are two historical chapters on the work of early 
explorers, and the volume concludes with some 
general observations of a scientific tenor, touch- 
ing the " pleasures of the natural sciences," the 
origin, age, and growth of mountains, nature 
of the forests, mountain lakes, etc. But the 
burden of the book is the author's graphic and 
enthusiastic account of his experiences in camp 
and on the mountain-side, and of the glorious 
scenery of the Rockies and the Selkirks. The 
volume contains twenty-five full-page photo- 
gravures and many vignettes after photographs 
that amply attest Mr. Wilcox's rare skill in 
managing and taste in placing his camera. 
There is no map, an omission which the author 
explains by saying that there are " no detailed 
maps covering this region that are entirely 
satisfactory." This want seriously impairs the 
usefulness of a generally satisfactory book ; and 
we trust it will be supplied in a subsequent 
edition of it. E. G. J. 



A TOBY AND A PATRIOT OF THE 
REVOLUTION.* 



In many special fields of investigation, a 
more careful research and a more deliberate 
judgment are reconstructing the history of our 
American Revolution. In no direction has 
our estimate of men and measures been more 
changed than as regards the Tory minority.

Sabine's " Loyalists of the American Revolu- 
tion " was for a long time a voice crying in the 
wilderness of national prejudice, and awaken- 
ing no response of sympathy or belief in minds 
fed on the mytho-historical literature which 
until just now satisfied the American historical 
instinct. But the new spirit that has at last 
produced an " American Historical Review " is 
modifying our estimate of every portion of our 
history. It would seem that men are only just 
beginning to read with discernment the vol- 
uminous original material, in the way of letters 
and diaries, that reveal to us the true mind and 
purpose of that age. And as we re-read, we 
are at last giving recognition to a body of 
worthy but unfortunate men, some of whom 
did large service for the republic in their earlier 
and happier days. Professor McMaster in his 
history, and Professor Moses Coit Tyler last 
year in the " Historical Review," only voice a 
growing sentiment among thoughtful Ameri- 
cans a sentiment which can go back, how- 
ever, to so great a patriot as Alexander Ham- 
ilton for its vindication. We are now saying 
simply that the men who, with Thomas Hutch- 
inson in the lead, stood by the mother country 
until they went down with her cause in per- 
sonal shipwreck and ruin, were many of them 
noble souls, ardent patriots, and devoted public 
servants ; and that their choice of the losing 
side in a great fight should not obliterate the 
knowlege of their high and disinterested pur- 
pose. Conservatives all of them, the stars in 
their courses fought against them, and they 
fell grandly. 

At the time of the outbreak of the troubles 
between England and the American Colonies, 
no man in America had deserved more of his 
fellow-men than Thomas Hutchinson. As far 
back as 1749, by his firm stand in the Assem- 
bly he had delivered the Colony from the evils 
of an irredeemable paper currency. As a mem- 
ber of the Council, as Judge of Probate and of 
the Common Pleas, as Chief Justice, as Lieu- 
tenant Governor, and finally as Governor, he 
had for many years been the most conspicuous 
and the ablest man in Massachusetts. Born of 
a long line of ancestors devoted to the interests 
of that Colony, well educated and highly placed 
by wealth and social standing, he filled the 
political horizon of the men of Massachusetts 
even more than Washington did that of the 
Virginians. Large-minded, public - spirited, 
and devoted to the public service, he seemed 
naturally fitted to take the patriot leadership 
in his province and in New England. But the 



186 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



whole habit of his mind and of his life was 
essentially conservative. He believed thor- 
oughly that union with the mother country was 
for the best interests of both countries, and that 
the evils of independence would be far greater 
than any that the Colonies experienced from 
imperial misgovernment. In this faith he lived 
and ruled ; in this faith, when ruling was no 
longer possible, and merely living in the prov- 
ince had become to him dangerous, he went 
into exile, and died, a broken-hearted and pre- 
maturely old man. 

His career is one of the most pathetic in his- 
tory ; and Mr. Hosmer, the latest delineator of 
his life, has handled the lights and shades of 
the picture with much skill. Mr. Hosmer was 
well fitted by his past work to treat this diffi- 
cult subject with discernment and fairness. His 
well-known life of Samuel Adams had been the 
result of much careful study of the conflict in 
which Adams and Hutchinson were the leaders. 
He says himself : " It was while writing the 
life of that sturdiest and trustiest of the Sons 
of Liberty, that the worth and greatness of his 
opponent became plain to me. To draw one 
without drawing the other is as impossible as it 
would be to photograph a wrestler in action 
without catching at the same time the cham- 
pion with whom he was locked." In the book 
before us Mr. Hosmer has been most success- 
ful in the middle course which the truth com- 
pels him to take amid conflicting opinion. He 
is just to the patriots and the patriot cause, 
yet has redeemed his subject from the obloquy 
which for a century and more has rested on him. 

Mr. J. J. Boudinot's work is not equal in 
excellence to that of Mr. Hosmer. He entitles 
his book " The Life of Elias Boudinot," and 
says in his preface : " The purpose of this vol- 
ume is to place before the reader the services, 
speeches, and letters of Elias Boudinot, in such 
chronological sequence that they shall for them- 
selves tell the history of his life." But the ed- 
itorial conception of the editor is so inadequate 
that the two volumes are merely a collection of 
miscellaneous material, not at all digested into 
any form adequate to present the life of Elias 
Boudinot. The book contrasts poorly with such 
a work as Kate Mason Rowland's " Life, Cor- 
respondence, and Speeches of George Mason," 
in which the individuality and personality of 
her great ancestor form a continuous back- 
ground to the array of documentary material 
edited. One gets herein little conception of 
Elias Boudinot ; and yet he was a man of as 
persistent and consistent character as Hutch- 



inson. A conservative also, in many respects, 
he yet took the patriot side from deep convic- 
tion, and served it actively, first as a member 
of the New Jersey Provincial Congress, then as 
Commissary-General of Prisoners through the 
nomination of General Washington, and finally 
as President of the Continental Congress. In 
all these positions the Huguenot puritanism of 
his ancestors crops out, yet the conscientious 
and somewhat pietistic protestant is saved from 
narrowness by a catholic toleration of other 
men's opinions far in advance of the religious 
mind of his day. These volumes are full of his 
simple Doric character, but one must gather 
it out bit by bit for himself. It is a pity that 
a running narrative has not threaded these iso- 
lated letters and speeches ; for all along is found 
the wisdom and fair-mindedness of one of the 
best of " the fathers " of the Constitution, both 
in the great mass of letters and in the appended 
speeches. A fine portrait of Boudinot at the 
age of fifty-eight, from the steel engraving by 
St. Memin, faces the title-page to the first vol- 
ume, and a grand one at the age of seventy- 
seven from the painting by Sully is found in 
the second volume. In this respect the editor 
has been more fortunate than Mr. Hosmer, who 
has given us in truth a beautiful portrait of 
Hutchinson from the painting by Copley, but 
it is the face of a youth, and does not in the 
least suggest the stern and stately old Governor 
whom men remember. J OHN J. HALSET. 



THE ELIZABETHAN SONNETTEERS.* 

Mrs. Martha Foote Crow is rendering a note- 
worthy service to students and readers in bring- 
ing together in accessible modern form, in her 
"Elizabethan Sonnet -Cycles," the chief pro- 
ductions of the first English sonnetteers. The 
sonnet is a definite literary kind in England, 
having important and interesting historical 
connections with the earlier poetry of Italy, 
and a long and honorable history in English 
verse ; and it therefore may conveniently be 
isolated for study. The greatest Elizabethan 
exemplars of the sonnet, Shakespeare, Spenser, 
and Sidney, are of course easily accessible ; but 
the others, Daniel, Constable, Lodge, Giles 
Fletcher, Drayton, Brooke, Percy, and the au- 
thors of " Zepheria " and " Alcilia," are gen- 
erally unfamiliar to the modern reader and are

not easily accessible. This collection will make 
possible for all a study of the complete species 
of the English sonnet-sequence in its earliest 
development and a comparison of its earliest 
with its latest forms and motives. And it is 
no doubt true, as has often been said, that a lit- 
erary kind or a literary period can be most 
faithfully studied in its minor examples, where 
the type is undisturbed by the abnormalities 
and the adventitious gifts of genius. Not that 
something of the note of genius does not appear 
now and then even in the humblest of the Eliz- 
abethan lyrists, something of that peculiar 
magic of utterance, and of that vivida vis 
animi which Professor Saintsbury singles out 
as the leading characteristic of the age, but 
that in the minor sonnetteers this note is at 
best but sporadic, and that, although their work 
to the trained lover of poetry is readable 
throughout, still the interest of it after all is 
chiefly historical. Not infrequently indeed one 
comes upon a sonnet-octave such as the follow- 
ing, half-Shakespearian in diction and foreshad- 
owing the manner of the Shakespeare of the 
sonnets : 

" Fair eyes, whilst fearful I your fair admire, 
By unexpressed sweetness that I gain, 
My memory of sorrow doth expire, 
And falcon-like I tower joy's heaven amain. 
But when your suns in oceans of their glory 
Shut up their day-bright shine, I die for thought ; 
So pass my joys as doth a new-played story, 
And one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught." 

But it is not the sonnet-sequence of Lodge, 
or of Daniel, or of Constable, that we should 
choose as the Elizabethan representative to put 
into comparison with a representative modern 
sonnet-sequence, such as Rossetti's " House of 
Life." No ; if we are debarred from Shake- 
speare's, it would rather be Sidney's or Spen- 
ser's. But to render such a comparison fair and 
of any profit, aside from the comparison of gift 
with gift and genius with genius, we should 
first of all recognize that the convention of the 
Elizabethan sonnet-sequence is different from 
that of the modern, that it stands nearer the 
Petrarchan tradition (only very lately aban- 
doned in poetry), that it has a different artistic 
aim, and that consequently it developed a dis- 
tinctive form and laws of its own. He who 
does this will recognize also that the form of 
the Elizabethan sonnet is entirely consonant 
with its spirit and aim, and he will be very 
cautious about dogmatizing concerning the 
superiority of the more " orthodox " modern 
sonnet structure. But in order to recognize all 
this, a study of the minor Elizabethan sonnet- 
cycles is pre-requisite. 



The natural Elizabethan impulse was more 
freely and fluently lyrical than suited altogether 
with the fixed canons of the sonnet, and espe- 
cially of the so-called " orthodox " sonnet. So 
strong was this impulse that the sonnetteering 
fashion in Shakespeare's day disdained the more 
regular restraints of the sonnet quatorzain and 
connected with the sonnet-motive a great vari- 
ety of lyric forms. Hence, among the minor 
sonnetteers, the mixed series, like Lodge's 
" Phillis " and J. C.'s " Alcilia," where lyric 
and canzon and ode are intermingled with qua- 
torzains, impress the reader as a less conven- 
tional and a more natural and taking develop- 
ment of the idea of a poetic-sequence than the 
more regular and artificial cycles of Daniel and 
of Giles Fletcher. The Elizabethan sonnet, in 
short, is to be studied in connection with the 
other lyric poetry of the period, and when a 
comparison is instituted between the modern 
sonnet and the Elizabethan, the differing char- 
acteristics of the entire lyric inspiration of both 
periods, as well as the differing laws of sonnet- 
structure in each, must be duly regarded. It is 
to aid us in such comparisons and such general- 
izations, not to mention the undistraught pleas- 
ure of the lover and reader of the choice old 
poetry of England, that such collections as the 
present, representing a definite literary kind in 
a definite literary period, are of especial value. 

In addition to a short but highly sympathetic 
and graceful General Introduction, the editor 
has prefixed to each sequence a separate Intro- 
duction, all conceived in admirable spirit, and 
supplying in compact form such apparatus and 
commentary as is indispensable to the modern 
reader. FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER. 



THE GROWTH OF BRITISH POLICY.* 

Four of the prominent historians who have 
died within the past two years were distinc- 
tively patriotic writers. Whether it was von 
Treitschke or von Sybel describing the origin 
of Prussian hegemony, or Froude defending the 
uprising of the English against Papal control, 
or Seeley explaining the growth of the British 
Empire, the work was national in its informing 
purpose. Doubtless the Prussians were truer 
lovers of their science than the Englishmen, 
but when they wrote they wrote as Prussians.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



As for Seeley, Professor Prothero, in a memoir 
prefixed to his essay on " The Growth of Brit- 
ish Policy," says " he was a good citizen, with 
a high sense of political responsibility," and 
that his aim in his lectures and addresses was 
" to foster an enthusiasm for the British state." 
This constant aim may heighten the interest 
of his books ; and under the control of so 
broad a thinker as Seeley was, it may not de- 
tract from the value of the work. But how 
dangerous it is to less clear heads may be 
observed in the pages of Professor Burrows, 
author of " The History of the Foreign Policy 
of Great Britain," whose purely British and 
insular view of the world's affairs would be 
irritating were it not so naive and childlike. 

Professor Seeley calls his work an essay and 
not a history. In it he has sought to discuss 
British policy in its formative period, believing 
that as the policy of a modern Great Power it 
arrived at maturity about the close of the seven- 
teenth century. He has chosen the accession 
of Elizabeth as the point of departure, for dur- 
ing Elizabeth's reign, by a combination of 
happy chances, the foundations of a Great 
Britain were laid. As one reads chapter after 
chapter of this work, one is impressed with the 
unity of thought which is maintained, the com- 
prehensive grasp in which the varying threads 
of European diplomatic affairs are held. There 
is only a single fault to be found with the 
method, and that is the somewhat tedious itera- 
tion of the same statement. Had this been 
avoided, many pages might have been gained 
for a fuller presentation of the underlying eco- 
nomic causes. The importance of these causes 
Professor Seeley himself acknowledges when, 
in speaking of the Revolution of 1688, he re- 
marks : " In whichever direction we look we 
find ourselves in the midst of economic phe- 
nomena." And if one compares his work with 
that of Professor Burrows, one observes how 
much more complete it is than the latter in this 
respect. Professor Burrows fails to mention 
even the Navigation Acts. 

Professor Seeley does not seek to bring to 
light new facts : he attempts to place familiar 
facts in more intelligible relations to one an- 
other. His treatment of Elizabeth's reign is 
unusually enlightening. The capital fact of her 
earlier years as queen was the triumph of the 
Counter-Reformation between 1564 and 1585. 
Had not Elizabeth strenuously adhered to her 
policy of peace, of leaving all questions unde- 
cided, and had she put herself at the head of a 
Protestant League, she would, thinks Professor 



Seeley, have been defeated. Meanwhile the 
danger from the North steadily decreased as 
Scotland became more Protestant, and at the 
same time more jealous of French interference. 
A union of sympathies grew up which was the 
prophecy of the closer political union of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. And on 
the side of the continent the outlook was not 
so dark as it might appear, because while 
Philip II. remained Duke of Burgundy there 
could be no true love in the hearts of patriotic 
Frenchmen for Spain, and the peace of Cateau- 
Cambresis could not seriously threaten Protes- 
tantism. Moreover, as England had lost her 
continental frontier during Mary's reign, and 
as Elizabeth, not being herself of the royal 
caste, refused to marry or to pursue a narrow 
dynastic policy, the new Great Britain had a 
period of quiet, healthful growth, compara- 
tively free from foreign entanglements. Since 
her enemy was Spain, she also received that 
impulse toward ihe sea which with her island 
position determined her future greatness. By 
the time when James I. mounted the throne 
she was strong enough safely to hold aloof from 
European struggles. 

Professor Seeley regards the Counter-Refor- 
mation not as a reaction predominantly, but as 
a distinct reform movement, to be placed side 
by side with the others which began at Pisa in 
1409. When the last session of the Council 
of Trent had been held, and the church had 
been reformed, the historical continuity was 
all on the side of the old church. The reformed 
churches had henceforth to justify their seces- 
sion. They had appealed to a council, and a 
council had been given them : what more could 
they claim ? 

Is not Professor Seeley wrong, however, when 
he declares " never since has the Reformation 
recovered the ground it lost so unexpectedly in 
those years " (from 1564 to 1585) ? Consid- 
ering the matter strictly on its religious side, 
perhaps this may be true ; but politically the 
rise of Prussia to the leadership of the German 
Empire has given Protestantism a strength it 
did not possess at any time in the sixteenth cen- 
tury. 

One of the most interesting of Professor 
Seeley's lines of thought relates to the Haps- 
burg marriage policy, adopted because of the 
immense success consequent upon the marriage 
of Maximilian of Austria to Mary of Burgundy, 
and the marriage of their heir Philip to Joan, 
heiress of the dominions of Ferdinand and Isa- 
bella. He regards Philip Second's marriage 



1896.]

to Mary Tudor as not merely Charles Fifth's 
revenge for the divorce, but as a Hapsburg con- 
quest of England, a conquest which reconciled 
Charles to the abandonment of the empire to 
Ferdinand in 1555. 

The Revolution of 1688 Professor Seeley 
considers not as a mere incident in the consti- 
tutional and dynastic history of England, but 
as an event of European significance, a piece 
of grand strategy in William's historic struggle 
against Louis XIV. He believes it may prop- 
erly be said to have begun in 1670 with the 
Treaty of Dover, and to have been concluded 
with the Peace of Ryswick in 1697. Further, 
he thinks the Stuart James was expelled quite 
as much because he was French in education 
and policy as because he was Catholic, an un- 
happy consequence of the marriage of Charles 
I. and Henrietta Maria. 

It is curious to find the English taken to task 
in those days, as the French are now, for polit- 
ical fickleness. Professor Seeley recalls the 
saying of Torci : " The English are a nation 
dont la legerete est connue ; Us changent sou- 
vent d'idees." 

A few words must be given to the work of 
Professor Burrows, who, as has been intimated 
already, is a convinced believer in the right- 
eousness of all British deeds. To him, England 
has been "the visible champion of International 
Law," who " found her duties to her own sub- 
jects correspond with her duties to her neigh- 
bors." The beautiful way in which the British 
spirit of entire self-abnegation was chastened 
by glimpses of the main chance is elucidated 
by our author when he comes to the French 
Revolution. He says : 

" It fell once more to the lot of Great Britain to be 
summoned, unwillingly summoned, to the front for the 
purpose of administering the International Law of Eu- 
rope. The call was explicit; but it none the less rep- 
resented the vital interests of Great Britain. It was 
not only that the vast majority of the people felt a gen- 
uine disgust at the principles which issued in the hor- 
rors of the French Revolution, and a profound sympa- 
thy for the oppressed nations which fell under the French 
yoke; they were convinced that in fighting for others 
the British were also fighting for themselves. This con- 
viction nerved every arm and inspired every sacrifice." 

Professor Burrows does not tell us how long it 
took the British after the war had begun to 
introduce the notion into their heads that they 
were fighting for themselves. Perhaps it was 
only after they seized South Africa to hold in 
trust for the Dutch, or after they had succeeded 
in monopolizing the commerce of the seas. 
Occasionally he seems to suspect that there may 
have been on the irrational continent, or in 



America, a different view of the situation ; but 
he covers these lapses from perspicacity with a 
mantle of sweet charity. 

Professor Burrows finds the bombardment 
of Copenhagen by the British fleet in 1807, and 
the slaughter of two thousand unoffending citi- 
zens for the purpose of seizing the Danish fleet, 
" a most dextrous stroke," and further defends 
it by reference to a legendary secret article of 
the Treaty of Tilsit. The British Orders in 
Council, too, which enabled them " to concen- 
trate the trade of the world in their own hands," 
were quite right, because " those who were the 
universal paymasters, and were drawing by 
hundreds of millions on posterity for this pur- 
pose, should at least have the power of paying 
interest to the national creditors." Professor 
Burrows quotes in support of his view Captain 
Mahan's admission that this policy toward neu- 
trals was necessary, and is a little surprised 
that the gallant Captain at the same time 
blames the United States Government for hav- 
ing tamely submitted for so many years to such 
reasonable requirements. He perhaps does not 
understand martial ethics and logic, according 
to which all parties are simultaneously and 
gloriously justified in punching one another's 
heads. 

No fault can be found with Professor Bur- 
rows's sense of humor when he can speak of the 
Irish Union as brought to pass " by the re- 
sources of genius at the hands of Chatham." 
This remark is delicious when we call to mind 
the means by which an Irish Parliamentary 
majority was gained, and which Lord Corn- 
wallis, one of the principal actors, called "this 
dirty business " and " the shocking task im- 
posed on me." 

There are certain errors and omissions in this 
book which seem to argue haste at the least. 
For example, this is the description of the out- 
break of war between France and England in 
1793 : " To put it shortly they [the French] 
overran and annexed Holland, and on the re- 
monstrance of the British minister, declared 
war." Again, Professor Burrows says that 
" Prussian troops had been beaten at Auster- 
litz when combined with those of Austria."

ORIGINS AND MEANINGS OF DECORATIVE 
ART.* 

" To show that delineations have an individ- 
uality and a life-history which can be studied 
quite irrespectively of their artistic merit," is 
one of Professor Haddon's objects in writing 
" Evolution in Art "; to show by specific cases 
the method to be pursued in such study, is an- 
other. The book bristles with suggestive points. 
That artistic patterns or decorations have a 
" life-history," that they are born, develop, 
pass through senility, and die, is a startling 
but true thought. The infancy and the senility 
of a given pattern often vary so profoundly as 
to be hardly recognized for one and the same. 
Who, uninstructed, sees at once the crocodile 
pattern worked out in detail on the curious 
arrows from Torres Strait ? Who, unless he 
makes a comparison of specimens, recognizes 
the frigate-bird head in the pretty running 
spirals on the handles of the lime-spatulas, or 
the human faces on the wooden belts from 
British New Guinea ? 

Decorative art, to be understood, must be 
studied as faunas are studied geographically. 
The same decorative design may come about in 
different ways in different regions. It is only 
when we study it in all its relations to climate, 
products, materials, tools, technique, life condi- 
tions, that we may be sure of its origin and of 
its development. 

Man has been constrained to artistic effort 
by four needs : Art, Information, Wealth, Re- 
ligion. Each gives rise to art forms. Upon 
any art form, once born, two forces operate : 
suggestion, which dynamically initiates and 
modifies ; and expectancy, which tends to con- 
serve unchanged what already exists. Mr. 
Haddon illustrates the results of these needs as 
acted upon by these forces. Taking first the 
art products of a limited field British New 
Guinea, he sketches its main features in elu- 
cidation of his proposition. He then selects 
examples from every clime. These he studies 
first, to indicate the material out of which 
man makes designs and patterns ; and second,

objective originals into aesthetic conceptions is 
not confined to one people, but is common to 
mankind.

designs, our author makes use of a series of 
recent terms in part of his own suggestion 
which are convenient. Decorative designs 
are either skenomorphs, physicomorphs, or bio- 
morphs. /Skenomorphs are decorative trans- 
formation and transference of originally neces- 
sary and non-ornamental technic characters. 
Thus, a late bronze axe may bear ornamental 
lines, which imitate the cord fastenings by 
which it was previously joined to its handle ; 
decorations on pottery may be the reproduction 
of the appearance of the basket-work, which 
preceded earthen vessels. PhysicomorpTis are 
decorative designs representing objects or oper- 
ations in the physical world. The rain-cloud 
of the Moki, the zigzag lightning symbol of 
many peoples, are examples. BiomorpTis are 
decorative patterns drawn from living things, 
and ma.yloephyllom.orpks ( vegetal), zoomorp hs 
(animal), or anthropomorphs (human), in 
their origin. When such decorative designs 
are not simple and pure, they may be called 
heteromorphs, and these may be either hetero- 
morphs of skenomorphs, of biomorphs, or of 
skeno-biomorphs . 

After a study of the reasons for which ob- 
jects are decorated, in which weight is given to 
each of the needs to be satisfied Art, Infor- 
mation, Wealth, Religion, Professor Had- 
don gives some practical suggestions upon the 
scientific method of studying decorative art. 
Recognizing that patterns are not freely evolved 
by savage peoples, but that they are suggested 
by some object, the student must first seek for 
the source of the suggestion ; he must then 
trace the development which may be upward 
specialization, degeneration, or selection. Orig- 
inated and developed, the design must be traced 
in its geographical wanderings a task of great 
delicacy, requiring much judgment. In such 
study, direct information from the maker or 
user of the object is vastly important, but not 
always accessible ; often induction and inter- 
pretation alone can be used. 

The author's material is drawn from many 
authorities, of varying value. Most of his facts 
are already known to the ethnographer. But 
he presents them suggestively so as to arouse 
much new thought ; he brings out a useful no- 
menclature ; he displays such earnestness as to 
kindle enthusiasm and raise up workers in a 
field where workers are much needed ; he also 
suggests the safe and useful method to be fol- 
lowed if real advance in the subject is to be

STUDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY.* 

A writer in a recent number of THE DIAL ( Pro- 
fessor J. J. Halsey, May 1, 1896, p. 268), says: 
" American national history cannot be finally writ- 
ten until the field of the local life be thoroughly 
investigated and the material classified." To the 
truth of this dictum, American historical students 
will generally testify. One of the most satisfactory 
phases of the activity in historical studies, now evi- 
dent among us, is the tendency to systematically 
develop this local field. Sectional, state, and local 
historical societies are busy searching the uttermost 
corners of their several domains, and pouring out 
upon us a mass of original material hitherto exist- 
ing only in manuscript form, and for the most part 
wholly inaccessible to students. The patriotic- 
hereditary societies, having emerged from the mildly- 
exciting stage of organization, are now proving 
themselves useful factors in civilization by editing 
and publishing historical documents, often of con- 
siderable importance. Several of the racial organ- 
izations are doing most admirable special work of 
this character, prominent among them, the na- 
tional Scotch-Irish, Huguenot, and Jewish Publica- 
tion societies, the Holland Society of New York, 
and the Pennsylvania-German Society. The county 
and town historians are unusually busy, these days ; 
and the often valuable newspaper " annuals " and 
" anniversary numbers " are not to be ignored, for 
many of them contain most excellent historical ma- 
terial, collected by competent hands. Last, but not 
least, the genealogists, who have of late become so 
numerous among us as to form a considerable per- 
centage of the daily patrons of reference libraries 
the country over, are doing their part in shedding 
light upon dark places, firmly convinced, with Mac- 
aulay, that the study of a nation's life is but the 
sum of the stories of individual careers. 

Now and then the story of an individual career 
is of prime importance to the general historian. 
Parkman and Fiske, for instance, have been partic- 
ularly skilful in their use of such. Warmly would 
Parkman have welcomed " Pote's Journal," which 
has just been given to the world ; and what a wealth 
of illustration he would have found in it for his 
Half Century of Conflict." Of the inner history 
of King George's War (1744-48), we have had an 
insufficiency of records. New York and a few other

colonies contributed to the army chest, but it was, 
in North America, essentially a war of New En- 
glanders against the Canadian French, for the ob- 
jective points were Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and 
northern New England. The French garrison at 
Louisbourg had news of the declaration of war 
(March 15, 1744) a full month before Boston re- 
ceived its information by a Glasgow ship. It was 
easy, therefore, for the French to surprise and cap- 
ture the English post of Canso, and send its garri- 
son as prisoners to Louisbourg. Annapolis Royal, 
the only English fortification now left in Nova 
Scotia, was sharply beset by the enemy, who was 
aided by Indians and rebellious Acadians. New 
England soon sent reinforcements thither ; but when 
supplies were forwarded to them in May, 1745, in 
the schooners "Montague" and "Sunflower," a 
French marauding party captured the vessels and 
their crews, at their anchorage in Annapolis Basin, 
sold or divided the cargoes, and sent the prisoners 
overland to Quebec. William Pote, Jr., a man of 
spirit and enterprise, was master of the " Mon- 
tague," and during his captivity of over two years 
(he was captured May 17, 1745, and released July 
30, 1747) kept an elaborate journal of his daily 
experiences. Smuggling this treasure through the 
lines, when finally exchanged, Pote appears to have 
given the journal to his superior officer, John Henry 
Bastide, chief-engineer of Nova Scotia ; and the 
plump little manuscript book remained in the pos- 
session of the latter's family for many years. Later, 
it drifted to the English colony at Geneva, Switzer- 
land, and in August, 1890, was there acquired by 
John Fletcher Hurst, to whom we owe its resurrec- 
tion and present sumptuous publication. 

The importance of the narrative will be appre- 
ciated when it is remembered that but two other 
accounts of this notable captivity have before seen 
print, and they but brief tracts by fellow-prisoners, 
which do not cover so long a period or give such 
full and interesting details. The editor, Mr. Hurst, 
does not overstate the case in saying : 

" While some accounts of the war make mention of 
Pote as a participant, and finally a captive, it is now 
first known, through the discovery of his complete Jour- 
nal, that he kept a minute record of his experiences, and 
of the important events of the war. It supplies many 
missing links, and reconciles contradictions which had 
hitherto defied the student of American Colonial His- 
tory. In addition, it throws full light on entire depart- 
ments of that important struggle between the French 
and the English for the possession, not of Canada alone, 
but of North America in general. It records incursions 
related to Pote by the captives themselves; gives mem- 
oranda of marriages, illnesses, deaths, and many other 
minute facts relating to the captives; and contains the 
best and fullest account of Donahew's exploit in Tat- 
megouche Bay. There is a strong genealogical element 
pervading the whole narrative. Indeed, the latter part 
of the Journal is occupied with a list of the persons who 
died during the two years of the captivity. This hitherto 
unknown treasury of genealogy is of absorbing interest 
and value to New England families, so many of which 
were represented in this large band of captives."

THE DIAL, 



[Oct. 1, 



Mr. Hurst supplies an introductory Account of 
the Journal itself ; Victor H. Paltsits, of Lenox 
Library, furnishes an Historical Introduction, with 
copious foot-notes and genealogical appendices ; and 
several old manuscripts, maps, views, and portraits 
are effectively reproduced for the volume. A fine 
large map of " The Northern English Colonies, 
together with the French neighbouring Settle- 
ments," drawn by Charles Morris for the use of 
Governor Shirly in the subsequent French and In- 
dian War, and dated August 16, 1749, has been 
rendered in facsimile from the original in Lenox 
Library, and is folded within separate covers. 
Editor, contributors, and publishers have severally 
well performed their parts, the result being an 
important contribution to American colonial history, 
which is at the same time an admirable specimen of 
bookmaking. It is unfortunate, however, that the 
editor should have adopted upon his title-page a 
term for the hostilities of 1744-48 which is now 
discarded by historians. To avoid confusion it has 
been found necessary by them to designate this 
affair as King George's War, reserving for the ulti- 
mate struggle of 1754-63 the title, French and 
Indian War. This neglect to properly designate the 
earlier campaign will lead to confusion among 
bibliographers and historical students. 

Mr. Roosevelt's great sectional history, " The 
Winning of the West," is progressing apace. In the 
fourth volume, now before us, he carries forward 
the story from 1791 to 1807 ; beginning with the 
uprising of the Northwestern Indians, who at first 
defeated St. Clair and Harmar, and were in turn 
effectually quelled by Anthony Wayne, the volume 
closes " with the acquisition and exploration of the 
vast region that lay beyond the Mississippi." In 
former volumes, the author dealt with the explora- 
tion and first settlement of the trans-Alleghany 
region, the crude formative period when the West- 
erners, almost wholly neglected by the tide-water 
colonists, broke the paths and wrested from a sav- 
age foe the wilderness beyond the mountains ; he 
tells us, in this volume, how the West at last forged 
to the front, and began the acquisition of that polit- 
ical power which it has since so effectively wielded. 
Mr. Roosevelt tells us how Kentucky, Tennessee, 
and Ohio became states, and Louisiana, Indiana, 
and Mississippi territories ; how the great stream of 
permanent settlers followed the over-mountain paths 
worn by Boone and other wilderness hunters, who 
in turn were swept by the incoming tide to the 
region beyond the Mississippi, where they could live 
in peace ; how the West came dangerously near 
separating from the Union, in its uneasiness over 
the Spanish ownership of the mouth of the Missis- 
sippi; how men like Clark and Wilkinson and Innes, 
jealous of the East, coquetted with foreign powers 
for the securing of political separation, until the 
final acquisition of Louisiana and the Far West put 
a stop to this plotting. We learn, in this volume, 
of the great land speculations which were curses to 



the early West ; we are told of Burr's conspiracy, of 
the several wars with the Creeks of the South and 
the swarming Algonkins of the Northwest, of the 
great exploring expeditions to and through the far 
West those of Lewis and Clark, and Pike. What 
is more, we are advised not only of the deeds of the 
leaders, we are made familiar with the daily lives and 
aspirations of the common settlers, the half-hunter, 
half-farmer men of the little log cabins in the back- 
woods clearings, the humble villagers of Lexington 
and Louisville and Nashville. Mr. Roosevelt not 
only has a broad grasp upon the main facts, the 
fruit of serious toil in original research among old 
records in manuscript and print : but his own life 
upon the frontier, under somewhat similar condi- 
tions, has given him an intimate knowledge of the 
earlier borderer, enabling him by rare insight and 
gift of phrase to paint for us a graphic picture of 
wilderness life, which is one of the greatest charms 
of " The Winning of the West." 

Mr. Roosevelt illustrates, in this otherwise admir- 
able volume, the inadvisability of attempting too 
much. The president of the New York Police Com- 
mission can have but little leisure for historical 
investigation or historical writing. Mr. Roosevelt 
did the greater part of his study of the West pre- 
vious to taking upon himself his present harassing 
office; it is only in putting his material together 
that he shows haste and sometimes negligence. Some 
day he will wish to revise, in the present volume, 
the not infrequent evidences of an overcrowded 
office-holding historian, the occasional crudities of 
expression in the text, the often slip-shod foot-notes, 
slight errors of statement, and careless proof-reading. 
These are minor defects, but Mr. Roosevelt is too 
good a book-maker not by this time to be grieved at 
them. There is a useful map of exploration routes, 
and the usual good index ; the concluding volume 
of the work should, and doubtless will, contain a 
general index to all. 

Public attention is just now being drawn to the 
Western Reserve, Connecticut's land reservation 
in Ohio, the centennial of which has recently been 
celebrated in Cleveland. The colonizing experiences 
of Gen. Moses Cleaveland in what was popularly 
called " New Connecticut," a hundred years ago, 
are not referred to by Mr. Roosevelt, although they 
were of prime importance ; neither does he say any- 
thing concerning the rival reservation between the 
Miami, Scioto, and Ohio rivers, the Virginia Mili- 
tary District. A few lines summarizing the story 
of each enterprise would have been advisable even 
in so general an account as " The Winning of the 
West." Concerning the Western Reserve, much 
has been written in detail ; the Western Reserve 
Historical Society, at Cleveland, has done its part 
in enlightening general historians concerning it, and 
the Western Reserve University helps to perpetuate 
its name. Of the inner history of the Virginia Mil- 
itary District, less is known. Burton's " Notes on 
the Northwest Territory," " The St. Clair Papers,"

and " Cutler's Memoirs," are accessible to students ; 
but tbese give us only a partial view the St. Clair 
view. In truth, there was a desperate struggle for 
supremacy, between the founder of colonization at 
Manchester and Chillicothe, General Nathaniel 
Massie, and the governor of the Northwest Terri- 
tory, General Arthur St. Clair. The Massie side 
of the contest is now for the first time presented in 
the life and letters of Nathaniel Massie, prepared 
by that pioneer's grandson, a citizen of Chillicothe, 
and published by the Robert Clarke Co., a house 
which has for many years done yeoman service for 
the cause of Western history, often with no other 
recompense than the commendation of students in 
this field. An important chapter in the story of 
Ohio will now have to be re-written, thus remind- 
ing us of the truth of the familiar dictum that each 
generation is obliged to write its own history, be- 
cause either of new material discovered, or a change 
in the mental attitude of the people. 

Professor McMaster's " With the Fathers " is a 
collection, within covers, of a " baker's dozen " of his 
fugitive essays on various topics connected with 
American history and polity, originally published in 
the leading magazines. The range is wide, chro- 
nologically, extending from " How the British left 
New York," down to the timely query, " Is Sound 
Finance Possible under Popular Government?" 
The Monroe doctrine, the third-term tradition, Wash- 
ington's inauguration, the Know-Nothing move- 
ment, and Franklin in France, are among the sub- 
jects treated. Our author throws no new light upon 
these, and could not be expected to do so, for it is 
well-threshed straw ; he has opinions, however, and, 
although we may not always agree with his conclu- 
sions, he is always interestingly readable. Uphold- 
ing the extreme jingo view of the Monroe doctrine, 
he maintains that the United States should " not 
permit any such contest [the attempted transfer of 
the political sovereignty of any portion of American 
soil, whatsoever, to European powers] to result in 
the increase of European power or influence on this 
continent." We should be ready, he thinks, being 
strong enough to do so, and might, he considers, 
makes right, to uphold this position " with force 
of arms." The professor evidently has inside infor- 
mation, thus far unknown to the members of the 
Boundary Commission, who are as yet undecided, 
when he unqualifiedly asserts that Venezuela is the 
rightful owner of " the area now claimed arbitrarily, 
and with no proof submitted, by Great Britain." 
In the matter of our financial policy, to which two 
papers are devoted, the author is a gold-standard 
man ; although what he brands as fiscal heresies 
sometimes win in popular elections, he has firm reli- 
ance on " the hard common-sense of the people, who 
in their own good time and way have heretofore 
adjusted all difficulties wisely." The index is well 
made. 

We have in Mr. Fisher's " The Making of Penn- 
sylvania " a state history quite out of the common. 



Pennsylvania was from earliest times a meeting- 
place of many peoples, representing many creeds 
and widely divergent interests. New England and 
the Southern colonies were planted almost exclu- 
sively by Englishmen ; but in the middle group 
there was a mingling of foreigners of many sorts 
and conditions, and nowhere was the variety so great 
as in Pennsylvania. Dutch, Swedes, Germans, 
Scotch-Irish, and Welsh united with the English ; 
between the Puritan solidarity of New England and 
the strongly-contrasted circles of Churchmen and 
English Dissenters of the South, there dwelt in more 
or less harmony, in Penn's domain, a curious mix- 
ture of Quakers, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lu- 
therans, Reformers of many kinds, Mennonites, 
Dunkards, and Moravians. All of these strangely- 
commingled folk, each community in its own way, 
had a share in the making of Pennsylvania. At first 
in separate groups, with sharply-defined character- 
istics and aims, often pulling apart though linked 
together, they in time were fairly merged in a great 
commonwealth. Mr. Fisher has, for the most part in 
good temper and with sound judgment, told us the 
story of each group, how " they all acted and re-acted 
on each other, changed sides in politics, and produced 
movements and counter-currents which make the 
history of the state extremely varied and interesting, 
and at the same time rather difficult to trace." It 
is a timely work in a comparatively untilled field, 
for the study of the elements which have made us 
a distinct people has thus far not progressed beyond 
the tentative stage. If allowances are made for ill- 
concealed bias, here and there, the book will be 
helpful to students of history and sociology. The 
author has not forgotten the necessary index.

leave the reader with a juster knowledge of the 
elements and growth of our national organism, than 
most works on the subject of twice its bulk. It 
strikes us as, all in all, the best manual of the kind 
yet published. Its judicial tone places it in marked 
contrast with text-books of the old flamboyant pat- 
tern, which have undoubtedly done much to breed 
in our people that strain of " jingoism " which 
makes them lend a ready ear to the rants of our 
Congressional Bobadils. It is pretty difficult to rid 
the " average man" (whom we perhaps take, as Mr. 
Matthew Arnold thought, too seriously in this coun- 
try) of the notion that the prime duty of an Amer-

ican historian writing American history is to claim 
everything and concede nothing, and to punctuate 
his recital with war-whoops. Dr. Channing's aim is 
"to trace the steps by which the American people 
and its peculiar type of federal state have developed 
out of such heterogeneous and unpromising mate- 
rials for nation-building as were to be found in the 
English-American Colonies in 1760." The space 
gained by omitting the familiar details as to battles 
and campaigns has been usefully devoted to the 
explanation of the deeper causes of the Revolution, 
and to the detailed story of the period between the 
close of the Revolutionary War and Madison's 
inauguration. The work extends to the end of the 
Civil War. The Virginia Resolves (1769), the 
Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Con- 
federation, the Constitution, and a serviceable Biblio- 
graphical Note, are appended ; and there are some 
good maps specially compiled by the author.

and interest not only lays claim to an ancestry 
through the Church of England reaching back to 
Apostolic times, but possesses a history of far more 
than ordinary interest in her development in this 
Western hemisphere. The materials for this history 
are to be found principally in numerous volumes of 
documents collated by the late Dr. Hawks and the 
present Bishop of Iowa, who have successively filled 
the position of historiographer of the Church in 
America. "The results of their editorial labors have 
been freely drawn upon by the Rev. Charles C. 
Tiffany, D.D., Archdeacon of New York, in his con- 
tribution to the excellent series of American Church 
Histories published by The Christian Literature 
Co., New York. Dr. Tiffany's work is comprised 
in Volume VII. of the series, and bears the title, 
" A History of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 
the United States of America." The subject is a 
broad one and is broadly treated. The history natur- 
ally divides itself into two distinct parts : The His- 
tory of the English Church in the Colonies (1607- 
1785), and The Protestant Episcopal Church in the 
United States (1789-1895). In the latter portion 
of the work its excellence is especially noticeable in 
the marshalling of its facts, the easy style of its 
narration, the defining of the various parties and 
schools of thought existing in the Church, and the 
presentation of the institutions which best exhibit 
the Church's life and progress. In a work of so 
much merit and such dignified appearance it is not 
a little surprising to find such misprints as " disas- 
terous " and " incredibel," and to find Bishop Stone's 
name given twice as "Storer," Bishop James Har- 
vey Otey as "James N. Otey," and Bishop Johnston 
as " Johnson." Some repetitions might have been 
avoided to the advantage of the book. That the 
author has a few pet phrases, which he is fond of 
introducing, is evident, and perhaps excusable, 
though it jars slightly on the reader's nerves to find 



the phrase " a name to conjure with " (now gener- 
ally employed as political slang) introduced a second 
time. But it seems hypercritical to direct attention 
to these defects in a book which is otherwise com- 
mendable. It is rich in appendices and tables, and 
is well indexed. Altogether, the Protestant Epis- 
copal Church may congratulate herself upon the 
good showing she is permitted to make in this 
ecclesiastico-historical symposium. 

A national Tbe often - propounded question 

English school whether there is, or ever has been, a 
of music. national English musical school or 

style, may now be considered as definitely answered 
in the affirmative by Mr. Frederick G. Crowest, 
through " The Story of British Music " (imported 
by Scribner). The work reveals the fact that no 
country neither France, Germany, nor Italy 
has so ancient an origin in music as has England, 
or a more glorious record ; in its far-off days, En- 
gland was really a more distinctively musical nation 
than any other, and also more musically character- 
istic than it is to-day. The " story " told in this 
volume, although ending where England's musical 
history is commonly counted as only fairly begin- 
ning at the close of the fifteenth century occu- 
pies four hundred interesting pages. So diligent 
has been the author's research that he has gathered 
together and reproduced some splendid proofs of a 
pure First Period school ; has shown how England's 
musical disputationists and theoretical writers stood 
in the first rank ; how secular music, and that greater 
art, sacred harmony, blossomed and grew ; how 
musical establishments and systems existing to-day 
were founded and put upon workable footings 
all prior to the times of the Tudors. Leaving his 
subject just on the threshold, as it were, we may 
well look forward to Mr. Crowest's promised con- 
tinuation of his story in another volume, when we 
may expect to meet, in the Elizabethan age, musi- 
cians as great in their way as were Shakespeare, 
Bacon, Halley, and Frobisher in theirs. One who 
knows nothing of musical art may follow the narra- 
tive with great interest and profit ; but the trained 
musician will find in this volume a special and 
unique value, owing to its illustrations of antique 
instrument and its copies of old melodies, harmonies, 
and systems of notation. 



A trinity of

The reasons for the existence of the 
somewhat liberal collections of vol- 
umes devoted to great commanders, 
great statesmen, and divers sets of men of letters, 
find more available exemplification perhaps in the 
indomitable Scot than in many another less likely 
unit. The latest additions to the " Famous Scots 
Series" (imported by Scribner) deal with a suffi- 
ciently characteristic trio John Knox, Robert 
Burns, and Hugh Miller; and, in biographies of 
a hundred and fifty pages each, present certain dif- 
ficulties. Of the three, Knox, at the hands of Mr. 
A. Taylor Innes, has been brought much more ade-

quately within the scope and nature of what the 
design of the series would seem to be. There is a 
judicious use of material, even a dynamic skill here 
and there in the arrangement of it; and the result 
is readable without being in the least slovenly. In 
the case of Burns, Mr. Gabriel Setoun has been less 
happy in his special outlook. The Scottish genius 
for controversy asserts itself ; and Burns, as often 
before in his posthumous vicissitudes, has to suffer. 
Mr. Setoun's intentions are plainly the best in the 
world, but he has ended, unfortunately, unlike his 
subject's fame, by confining himself to one side of 
the Cheviots. A little more attention to broader 
movements in literature than to mere biographical 
differences of opinion, and he might have gratified 
himself by a consideration of Burns not as a paro- 
chial but as a European product. The least com- 
mendable of the three lives is that of Hugh Miller, 
in which Mr. W. Keith Leask also has been need- 
lessly controversial, and incidentally does not get 
his proportions well fused. The volume on Knox 
has an apparently careful index, and that on Miller 
has a bibliography ; the Burns is without either.

Its field-work has been most significant. Its explo-

The collections it possesses represent every part of 
the United States, and comprise interesting series 
from Mexico, Central America, and Peru. Through 
its agency the great Serpent Mound in Ohio has

erature has already grown. Three sets of publica-

papers. Recently, however, they have been con- 
fined to business and statistical statements, while 
papers upon set subjects have been printed inde- 
pendently. Five such special papers have now ap-

duras, during the years 18911895. Since the time 
of John Lloyd Stephens, these ruins have been 
among those most admired and visited in the Isthu- 
mian district. Dr. Alfred P. Maudsley added much 
to the work of Stephens and Catherwood. The re- 
port before us carefully locates every ruin in the 
group, with maps and descriptions. Cute and good 
plates supplement the text. Professor Putnam and 
his helpers are to be congratulated upon the mate- 
rial and quality of this their first quarto publication. 



Three branches Professor William Bondy has con- 
of governmental tributed a substantial sum to the fund 
powers. Q g enera i information by the able 
and exhaustive manner in which he presents and 
discusses " The Separation of Governmental Pow- 
ers." The book is the second number of Volume V. 
of " Studies in History, Economics, and Public 
Law," a series which is ably edited by the Univer- 
sity Faculty of Political Science in Columbia Col- 
lege, and published by the Macmillan Co. The sub- 
ject is considered historically, theoretically, and in 
the constitutions. The arrangement of the contents 
is thoroughly logical, and the presentation of the 
subject-matter is clear and concise. While there is 
no attempt at extended discussion of any phase of 
the subject, enough is said to inform the reader of 
the point which it is aimed to make, and the copious 
references and footnotes amply tell the rest. The 
governmental powers considered are, of course, the 
executive, the legislative, and the judicial. Mr. 
Bondy asserts that in spite of the strong language 
used in the American constitutions with regard to 
the separation of governmental powers, " there is 
not a single constitution in which some of the chief 
powers of government were not made dependent for 
their proper exercise upon the action of more than 
one of the governmental departments, and in which 
powers, historically or theoretically considered ex- 
ecutive, have not been exercised by the legislative 
and judicial departments ; in which powers consid- 
ered judicial have not been exercised by the legis- 
lative and executive departments; and in which 
powers considered legislative in their nature have 
not been exercised by the executive and judicial 
departments." The book is well adapted for use 
by the student, by the professional man, and by the 
general reader. 

We have repeatedly spoken words 
of P 8e concerning the "English 
Classics " published from time to time 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The skill with 
which these texts are edited for school use, and the 
evident determination to treat them as literature 
rather than as material for historical annotation and 
philological analysis, are qualities that commend 
this series of books to progressive teachers. Five 
numbers have recently been added to the series : 
" Southey's Life of Nelson," edited by Mr. E. L. 
Miller ; " The Vicar of Wakefield," edited by Miss 
Mary A. Jordan ; Books I. and II. of " Paradise 
Lost," edited by Dr. E. E. Hale, Jr.; the "Sir 
Roger " papers, edited by Mr. D. 0. S. Lowell ; 
and Macaulay's "Johnson," edited by Mr. H. G. 
Buehler. All of these books are welcome for the 
excellence of their editing, and the Nelson is addi- 
tionally welcome as a comparative novelty in En- 
glish texts. Another highly meritorious book of 
this class is Mr. W. J. Rolfe's second series of the 
Tennysonian " Idylls " (Houghton), completing this 
edition of the work. For the " Eclectic English 
Classics " of the American Book Co. not much may

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



be said. The work done upon these texts is so per- 
functory and inadequate that the editors are unwill- 
ing to let their names appear. Three volumes just 
issued contain " The Princess," " Franklin's Auto- 
biography," and four books (1, 6, 22, 24) of Pope's 
" Iliad." Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. have re- 
cently published three books for teachers of English. 
Miss Lucy Tappan's " Topical Notes on American 
Authors " deals with eleven representative writers, 
is the outgrowth of several years of experience in 
teaching, and will be found helpful by other teach- 
ers. The other two books are editions of "As You 
Like It " and Irving's " Sketch Book," the former 
edited by Mr. Homer B. Sprague, the latter by Mr. 
James Chalmers. Allied with the above-named 
books in interest is the new " Practical Rhetoric " 
of Mr. John D. Quackenbos, which aims to adopt 
" the aesthetic as the true basis of literary criticism," 
and is published by the American Book Co. 

One of the most useful volumes pub- 
ng. lhed the excellent International 

Education " series ( Appleton) is Pro- 
fessor B. A. Hinsdale's book about "Teaching the 
Language-Arts." It is the outgrowth of the author's 
pedagogical teaching at the University of Michigan, 
and is based upon a wide knowledge of the condi- 
tions that obtain in American education. The cen- 
tral idea of the treatment is the importance of the 
part played by imitation, conscious or unconscious, 
in the mental growth of the child ; and the book may 
almost be described as the application of this idea 
to the teaching of speech, reading, and composition. 
The author thus states the chief objects of his work : 
" The claim to merit must rest on these particulars : 
First, the clear conception and description of speech, 
reading, and composition, as arts ; secondly, the 
large place assigned to use and wont, to models and 
imitation, and the small place to reflective art in 
teaching them ; and, thirdly, the grounding of the 
several teaching processes in the fundamental facts 
of human nature." The claim as thus stated may 
fairly be allowed, and it must be added that the 
discussion is admirably clear, besides being made 
interesting by all sorts of apposite illustrations, 
drawn from a wide range of reading that is by no 
means confined to educational lines. Every teacher 
of English in a primary or secondary school should 
study this book, and take to heart its fundamental 
thesis. 

German myth There are a number of books that 
and legend bear upon the subject-matter of Wag- 

in Wagner. ner > g O p erag> an( j we tn ; n k tne l atest 

is the best to be found in English. Miss Jessie 
L. Weston's "Legends of the Wagner Drama" 
(imported by Scribner) is a careful and in many 
respects satisfactory piece of work. It does not con- 
sider all of Wagner's operas ; but the legends on 
which are founded the Nibelungen Trilogy, Par- 
sifal, Tristan and Isolde, Lohengrin, and Tann- 
hauser, are discussed in some detail. As a rule, 



a sketch of each legend is given ; in the case of the 
Nibelungen Trilogy, for instance, Miss Weston gives 
abstracts of the Volsunga-saga, the Thidrek-saga, 
and the Nibelungen-lied. The main part of the 
treatment, however, consists of a discussion of the 
legend and of its treatment by Wagner. Although 
not affecting the position of a specialist, Miss Wes- 
ton has a very considerable acquaintance with the 
literature of the subject. From the standpoint of 
scholarship there are some adverse criticisms that 
might be made. The treatment of the proper names 
seems to show a lack of linguistic knowledge. We 
doubt the expediency of working so absolutely from 
Simrock. His book has run through many edition*, 
and is still of value ; but his descriptive treatment 
is rather confusing. There are other things that 
might be noted ; perhaps the main criticism would 
be that Miss Weston goes into the subject rather 
farther than the ordinary reader can follow her, 
and yet not always with the assured confidence and 
power of the scholar. But even in such case, the 
book will meet the wants of a large number of 
readers, and will serve as introduction to a very 
interesting subject. 



Memories 
of quaint 
Nanlucket. 



In his " Quaint Nantucket " (Hough- 
ton), Mr. William Root Bliss has 
collected many pleasant memorials 
of that storied island as it existed, or vegetated, for 
some two centuries before the present annual inva- 
sion of the " summer boarder " began. The sources 
of information drawn upon comprise the original 
town and court records, old letters, account-books, 
ships' logs, and so on. These documents the author 
has freely " scissored," the resulting spoils being 
then duly sifted and classified, and finally sewn to- 
gether on a thread of running comment and de- 
scription a style of book-making rendered familiar 
by the useful volumes on early New England life 
by Mrs. Alice Morse Earle. Mr. Bliss sets before 
us a good deal of quaint matter touching old Nan- 
tucket life and character, a very amusing chapter 
being one descriptive of " Sea-Journals and Sea- 
Rovers. " One of these ancient marines especially, 
a Captain Peleg ( pronounced " Pillick " ) Folger 
must have been an odd fish, even for Nantucket. 
He may have been the hero of the local stave 

" Old Uncle Pillick he built him a boat 
On the b-a-a-ck side of Nantucket P'int ; 
He rolled up his trousers an' set her afloat 
From the back side of Nantucket P'int " 

But Mr. Bliss does not say so. Captain Peleg's 
log-book was, in Nantucketese, indeed a " caution," 
chiefly from its gifted author's habit of mixing up 
his daily records of fair winds and foul, " sperma- 
ceties " sighted and killed, and the like nautical and 
appropriate matters, with scraps of Latin and totally 
irrelevant moral reflections. His cheerful record of 
a day's " good catch," for instance, winds up with 
the doleful and uncalled-for motto," " Death sum- 
mons all men to the silent grave "; while a few days 
later he piously writes : " We have killed two Sper-

maceties. Now for home Boys ! We have 70 bar- 
rels full in our Hold ex beneficia, divina." Cap- 
tain Peleg's Latin habit was not, it seems, regarded 
with favor by his shipmates, one of whom scrawls 
irreverently in his magnum opus : " Old Peleg Fol- 
ger is a Num Scull for writing Latin. I fear he 
will be Offended with me for writing in his Book 
but I will Intercede in his behalf with Anna Pitts 
to make up for ye same Nathaniel Worth." Mr. 
Bliss treats in other chapters of " The Nantucket 
Indian," " The Dominion of the Quakers," " The 
Town's Doings," " Nantucket's School of Philoso- 
phers," etc. The book is a capital one to while 
away a summer's visit to " Quaint Nantucket." 

The excellent Shakespearian, Dr. 
William J. Rolfe, has given, in a 
pretty volume entitled " Shakespeare 
the Boy " (Harper), an elaborate picture of the 
Stratford of the dramatist's boyhood, and of the life 
and manners, especially the local life and manners, 
of the period. Next to nothing is absolutely known 
of the life of Shakespeare. Most of the items com- 
posing his traditional biography rest on no basis of 
sound evidence. We may as well reconcile our- 
selves to that disagreeable fact. But by piecing 
together in detail the conditions that surrounded his 
boyhood, and especially those that peculiarly affected 
boys, we can form a faint general notion of what 
young Shakespeare, in common with other Strat- 
ford lads of his time and condition, might, could, 
would, or should have done during the second stage 
of his " seven ages." Such a mosaic of Stratford 
boy-life Dr. Rolfe has given us. Drawing from 
trustworthy sources, he writes entertainingly of 
Warwick and Kenilworth Castles, Charlecqte Hall, 
of the Stratford Guild, Corporation, and topog- 
raphy, of the Stratford schools, of the home life, 
games and sports, holidays, festivals, and fairs of 
the period, and so on. The text is freely strewn 
with quotations in point, largely from the dramatist's 
own writings. The book is based on a series of 
four familiar articles written by Dr. Rolfe for the 
" Youth's Companion," two years ago. These pa- 
pers are now revised and enlarged to thrice their 
original compass, and a new fifth chapter has been 
added. Those who care least for the conjectural 
element in the book may well value it for its his- 
torical and descriptive interest. There are a num- 
ber of attractive woodcuts. 



Mr. Gladstone's Students of Butler are much indebted 
subsidiary studies to Mr. Gladstone for the admirable 

of Bishop Butler. ed i tion o f the Bishop's works which 

the old statesman a few months since gave to the 
world, and which was noticed at length in THE 
DIAL (April 16, 1896). Perhaps Mr. Gladstone's 
tireless pen might well have rested, and spared 
itself the later labors of his " Studies Subsidiary to 
the Works of Bishop Butler" (Macmillan). They 
will hardly add to the fame of the writer. They are 
evidently the fruit of the lifelong meditation of a 



subtle and laborious mind upon a favorite author. 
Without wishing to be impertinent, one is tempted 
to say that they are very much such papers as an 
able and conscientious Oxford " Coach " might fur- 
nish for the service of a promising candidate for 
honors. They abound in various material, yet one 
cannot say that they contribute much to our knowl- 
edge of Butler, or to the advance of Christian ethics 
or Christian theology. Mr. Gladstone is a brilliant 
financier, an able administrator, an accomplished 
parliamentarian, a splendid orator, a striking and 
interesting personality; but he is not a profound 
thinker. His rhetoric is more copious than lucid, 
more vigorous than luminous. You recognize the 
acute and practised debater in his replies to some 
modern critics of Butler. Yet he interests rather 
than satisfies us. His discussions of Butler's method, 
and of his mental qualities, are perhaps the best 
parts of what must be pronounced a rather dull 
volume. Some readers may care to know that the 
author somewhat leans toward the doctrine of con- 
ditional immortality. 



A pleasant 
picture of 
Leo XIII. 



Mr. Justin McCarthy's " Pope Leo 
XIII." strikes us as easily the best 
volume, thus far, in the useful " Pub- 
lic Men of To-Day " series (F. Warne & Co.). Mr. 
McCarthy is in full sympathy with his theme, and 
he treats it lucidly and temperately, and with com- 
mendable breadth and balance of judgment where 
the papal attitude toward vexed social and political 
questions, past and current, is discussed. It will be 
well worth while for those who wish to inform them- 
selves briefly and pleasantly as to the main features 
of Leo's career and personality, and his share in 
and views on public events, to turn to Mr. McCar- 
thy's little book. Especially good are the chapters 
on the German Kultur-Kampf, and the Church's 
relations with organized labor. There is an attrac- 
tive frontispiece portrait of the Pope, showing a 
strong, calm, benevolent face truly " a face like a 
benediction." Bigotry itself might melt before the 
tale of Leo's genuine goodness and high humani- 
tarian intent ; and Mr. McCarthy tells it well, and 
with a sober enthusiasm that is more effective than 
the strained panegyric of mere hero-worship or 
saint-worship. 

Some literary Mr - Laurence Button's "Literary 
landmarks of Landmarks of Venice" (Harper) is 
Venice. a verv acceptable addition to his 

pretty series of volumes on the " Literary Land- 
marks " of London, of Edinburgh, and of Jerusalem. 
The text is based on the author's article on Venice 
in " Harper's Magazine " for July, 1896 ; and is the 
result, he tells us, of weeks of patient study of the 
Queen of the Adriatic herself. The usual Venetian 
guide-book is mostly a bald affair, and aggravat- 
ingly devoid of the class of facts sought by the book- 
man. It tells us, of course, where Faliero plotted 
and Foscari fell, where Desdemona wept and Shy- 
lock drew his bond ; but it gives no hint as to where

[Oct. 1, 



Scott lodged or Rogers breakfasted of the doings 
and habitations, in short, of the many English and 
American men of letters who have visited or lived 
at Venice. This lack it is Mr. Hutton's chief aim 
to supply ; and his book should find a place in the 
satchel of every American tourist to Italy. There 
is much pleasant chat as to Dickens, Goethe, J. A. 
Symonds, the Brownings, Mr. Lowell, Mr. Howells, 
Eugene Schuyler, Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, and 
other literary lights the great Italians who have 
lived at Venice not, of course, being neglected. 
There are a number of illustrations. 



" The Spirit 
in Litf.rature 
and Life." 



In all the various attempts which 
men are making to re-state their old- 
time faith in the light of modern needs 
and discoveries, few have been attended with more 
success than " The Spirit in Literature and Life " 
(Houghton), the little posthumous work of Dr. 
Coyle. Starting with the conception of spirit, some- 
thing in the sense of the word Zeitgeist, as a pure 
phenomenon and by no means an abstraction, the 
author traces the development of the Hebrew spirit 
up through the history of the kings and prophets 
and priests to the time of Jesus, in whose work he 
sees the fruition of the long course of development. 
His spirit is seen carrying the social instincts of 
men into the various relationships of life. Every- 
thing that makes toward the union of man with man 
and of man with God is normal. On this basis the 
author works out, somewhat briefly, a new concep- 
tion of the old theological dogmas. He does not, 
it is true, arrive at conclusions which would please 
the most ultra-conservative, but at the same time 
his own spirit is so liberal and earnest as to disarm 
criticism. The book is marked by a wide reading, 
and a mastery of many things sufficient to enable 
the author to know what not to say. It is most cer- 
tainly a book for readers of the present day. 

A good book Certainly the best book ever written 

on the myths of by its author is " The Myths of the 
the New world. New World,' ' by Dr. Daniel G. Brin- 
ton. For nearly thirty years it has profoundly 
influenced ethnological thought, and has done much 
to kindle interest in the psychology, mythology, and 
religion of the native Americans. The earlier edi- 
tions have for some time been difficult to secure. 
The third edition, just from the press of Mr. David 
McKay, Philadelphia, is fairly revised, and contains 
some fifty pages of new matter. The general treat- 
ment and style of the first edition have for the most 
part been retained. Nowhere have development 
and progress been more rapid than in ethnologic 
science ; many views which, when first advanced by 
our author, were bold and novel, are to-day almost 
commonplaces. It is unnecessary to here review the 
book in detail, but a hint of its contents may not 
be without value to the reader who has not seen the 
older editions. Dr. Brinton discusses such topics as 
the Idea of God, Sacred Numbers, Bird and Serpent 
Symbols, Myths regarding the World Elements, 



Supreme Gods of the Red Race, Cosmogonies, The 
Origin of Man, the Conception of the Soul. To 
study the religious thought of a rude and barbarous 
folk is suggestive and stimulating to every thought- 
ful reader. 



LiITERARY NOTES. 

The Joseph Knight Company announce a new edition, 
in fourteen volumes, of Lady Jackson's popular books 
on French history and society. 

" An Arctic Boat Journey in the Autumn of 1854," 
by Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, has just been put into a new 
edition by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It was first 
published in 1860. 

Ill the notice of Gounod's Reminiscences, in the last 
issue of THE DIAL (p. 157), the J. B. Lippincott Co., 
and not the Macmillan Co., should have been named as 
the American publishers of the book. 

The Macmillan Co. publish a new edition of " The 
Life of Richard Cobden," by Mr. John Morley. There 
are two volumes as before, unchanged as far as we have 
observed, and the price is three dollars. 

Messrs. Sheehan & Co., of Ann Arbor, announce a 
series of reprints illustrative of English history, to be 
edited by Mr. W. Dawson Johnston. They will consist 
of documentary matter, and will cost twenty-five cents 
a number. 

Dr. Wilhelm Dorpfeld, of Athens, has just been lec- 
turing at Cornell, and is to appear at Yale (Oct. 1-10), 
Harvard (Oct. 11-22), Chicago (Oct. 24-31), Penn- 
sylvania (Nov. 1-10), and Columbia (Nov. 11-20). His 
subjects relate to recent archaeological work in Greece. 

" Songs and Other Verses," " Second Book of Tales," 
and "The Holy Cross and Other Tales, "three volumes 
by the late Eugene Field, which have already been dis- 
cussed in our review of the complete edition of Field's 
writings, are now published in a less expensive form 
(Scribner), and are obtainable separately. 

Mr. Harold Frederic, writing to the American press, 
says that " it has become an open secret that Mr. Alfred 
Austin is practically under an injunction to preserve 
silence." If the effect of an appointment as Laureate 
is hereafter to be that of muzzling the poet thus dis- 
tinguished, we could wish to see the office multiplied. 

Mr. Edward Garnett's new translation of Tourgue'- 
nieff's " Virgin Soil," in two volumes, and a translation 
of Herr Bjb'rnson's " The Fisher Lass," are among the 
latest publications of The Macmillan Co. From the 
same source we have received " The Exodus," in " The 
Modern Reader's Bible," and two new volumes of the 
" Temple " Shakespeare, " Pericles," and " Cymbeline." 

" Bimetallism in History " is the subject of the issue 
of "Sound Currency" for August 15. Mr. Henry 
Loomis Nelson, the editor of " Harper's Weekly," is the 
author of this pamphlet, which marshalls the arguments 
for the gold standard in a highly effective way. Spe- 
cial attention should also be called to Professor Sum- 
ner's uncompromisingly logical treatment of this subject 
in the October " Chautauquan." 

Three booklets upon subjects of timely interest have 
just been published by Mr. Henry Altemus, of Phila- 
delphia. They are " The Higher Education as a Train- 
ing for Business," by Professor Harry Pratt Judson; 
" The Origin, Meaning, and Application of the Monroe 



1896.]

Doctrine," by Professor John Bach McMaster; and 
" Why Americans Dislike England," by Professor 
George Burton Adams. All three are neatly bound in 
white boards. 

Readers of the " Atlantic Monthly " in its recent 
issues have been conscious of a subtle transformation in 
the spirit and purpose of the magazine. The change 
may perhaps be defined as an attempt to give to the 
contents a greater degree of actuality and a wider scope 
than they have had hitherto, without sacrificing the lit- 
erary quality which has made the " Atlantic " preemi- 
nent among its contemporaries. A new department, 
called " Men and Letters," appears in the October num- 
ber, and includes short signed articles similar to those 
of the " Contributor's Club." It is a pleasant addition 
to the magazine, and is very happily begun by Mr. 
W. D. Howells. 

The Princeton Sesquicentennial, to occur this month, 
will be celebrated for three days beginning with Octo- 
ber 22. There will be a distinguished gathering of 
European and American scholars to do honor to the ven- 
erable institution of learning, and the occasion will be 
in many ways memorable. A feature of much general 
interest is provided by the public lecture courses of 
which announcement has just been made. These lec- 
tures will run from the 12th to the 19th of the month 
(thus preceding the formal celebration), and the lectur- 
ers include Professors Edward Dowden, Karl Brugmann, 
Felix Klein, and Andrew Seth. Professor Dowden's lec- 
tures will be six in number, having for their general 
theme "The French Revolution and English Litera- 
ture." 

TO SWINBURNE. 

By the light and the love of the lilies; 

By the hue of the hyaline stones; 
By the whinny of whimpering fillies 

To the meek mother-mare, as she moans; 
By the gleam and the growl of the dog-star, 

That howls on his hubs, as they turn; 
By the murk and the mist of the fog-bar, 
We adjure thee, Swinburne, 

Tell us, Bard, in a rondel or sapphic, 

Virelai, villanelle, or ballade, 
In language for once somewhat graphic, 

What thy message is, ere we go mad! 
Feeble mouths faintly falter thy music, 

Word-witchcraft betrays thy behest; 
Of rime-revels, indeed, not a few sick 
Cry: " Give us a rest! " 

If, like Eve, thou forbidden fruit feed me, 

My old Adam adumbrates desire, 
Poet sad, mad, and bad, as I read thee, 

The apple to pick from the mire. 
But I swoon, for thy word-swirls oppress me; 

Walking water, I falter and fall; 
I am crazy to ken, Heaven bless me, 
What thou means't by it all! 

The crest and the crown of the laurel, 

Worn by bards who would broach " nothing base," 
Burns a brand on the brow of the lorel 

To whom the distinction 's disgrace. 
But profounder disgrace, O enigma 

Of poets and prophets, is thine, 
For stamping with stain and with stigma 

Thy genius divine! MBA

The Editor's " Progress of the World " adds fur-

its impartial discussions of the stirring political

fourth convention at Indianapolis, the candidates 
named there, the work of the Presidential candi- 
dates, not forgetting the events which have made 
the history of the month in England, Europe, Asia, 
and Africa as well. 

The political situation is hit off very picturesquely 
in still another department, that of " Current His- 
tory in Caricature," in the many striking cartoons 
printed there. The critical sentiments, personalities, 
and events of the campaign are vividly brought out 
in this pungent chapter.

This ante-election number is an indispensable 
summing up of the present political situation ; taken 
with its three predecessors, it completes a faithful

candidates, and valuable discussions of the currency 
issues by the scientists of Europe and America whose 
unpartisan attitudes and attainments best fit them

NOW READY JAMES M. BARRIE'S GREAT STORY, 

SENTIMENTAL TOMMY. 

The Story of his Boyhood. By JAMES M. BARRIE. Illustrated by WILLIAM HATHERELL. 12 mo, $1.50. 

" Sentimental Tommy " has been the success of the year during its serial publication. It has been the one 
serial talked of, and, as more than one critic has said, to be " eagerly waited for." The conception of the story is 
entirely unique that of making the loves and tragedies of his elders tell themselves through Tommy's mind and 
Tommy's experiences; and when in doing this Mr. Barrie has made Tommy one of the most delightful charac- 
ters in fiction, he has written a book which, not to speak of its genius, is one of the most entertaining of the time.

OF 

NEPHELE 

A NOVEL BY FRANCIS WILLIAM BOURDILLON 

12mO) artistically bound price, One Dollar 

"We urge so rare a treat as its pages impart 
on the attention of our readers." 



From THE LONDON SPECTATOR (page review). 

Mr. Bourdillon knows how to make a meeting in the spirit read as real and impressive as a meeting in the 
flesh, and how to elaborate his conception so as to make it seem a true deed of destiny, and of that kind of destiny 
to which the Greeks gave the name a result of imperious necessity, breaking ruthlessly through all the more 
natural and humble attractions of human life, and impressing the high, and we may almost say bleak, rapture of 
tragedy on lives that might have seemed carefully prepared for sweet and innocent delight. Mr. Bourdillon must 
have felt to the very bottom of his heart what Cardinal Newman, while he was still an Anglican, said of the mar- 
vellous mystery of music, and we almost wonder that he did not take it for the motto of his little poetical romance. 
" To many men," said Dr. Newman, " the very names which the science [of music] employs, are utterly incom- 
prehensible. To speak of an idea or subject seems to be fanciful or trifling, to speak of the views which it opens 
upon us, to be childish extravagance; yet is it possible that the inexhaustible evolution and disposition of notes, so 
rich yet so simple, so intricate yet so regulated, so various yet so majestic, should be a mere sound which is gone 
and perishes! Can it be that those mysterious stirrings of heart, and keen emotions, and strange yearnings after 
we know not what, and awful impressions from we know not whence, should be wrought in us by what is unsub- 
stantial, and comes and goes, and begins and ends in itself! It is not so; it cannot be. No, they have escaped 
from some higher sphere; they are the outpourings of eternal harmony in the medium of created sound; they are 
echoes from our Home; they are the voice of Angels or the Magnificat of Saints, or the living laws of Divine 
Government or the Divine attributes; something are they besides themselves which we cannot compass, which we 
cannot utter though mortal man, and he perhaps not otherwise distinguished above his fellows, has the gift of 
eliciting them." That is the conception of music on which this poetical romance is founded; and very finely it is 
constructed. 

From THE LONDON ATHEN/EUM. 

The central idea of two persons bound together by an intense musical sympathy capable of acting " telepath- 
ically " trenches closely on the domain of the fairy tale; but Mr. Bourdillon manages to pitch his narrative in the 
right key for producing an effect of quasi- reality; while the little touches of school and university life do not, 
on the other hand, jar by over-realism. 

From THE GLASGOW HERALD. 

His story is a beautiful prose poem, whose transcendental or allegorical meaning will come with especial force 
and charm to the skilled musician. But no one, whether musical or not, can read it without being thrilled through 
and through by its weird and delicate suggestions.

WILLIAM MORRIS. 

Of the six great poets whose names stand 
preeminent in the later Victorian era, five have 
gone to their rest, and the solitary figure of 
Mr. Swinburne alone remains to bear aloft the 
torch of the singer. Rossetti died in 1882, 
Arnold in 1888, Browning in 1889, Tennyson 
in 1892 ; and now " the idle singer of an empty 
day," as William Morris styled himself with 
modesty no less excessive than that which 
prompted Keats in the suggestion of his own 
epitaph, has ceased from life, and entered into 
the inheritance of fame that he shares with 
Chaucer and Boccacio, with the creators of 
Norse saga and mediaeval French romance. The 
death of these five men one after another, with- 
out the appearance of any new poet comparable 
with the least of them, has practically estab- 
lished the contention made many years ago by 
Mr. Stedman, that a well- marked period in 
English poetry was drawing to its close with 
the last quarter of the nineteenth century. 

The affinities of Morris are with Rossetti 
and Mr. Swinburne, rather than with Arnold, 
Browning, or Tennyson ; and the public early 
learned to associate the three poets first-named, 
not only with one another, but also with the 
movement in English painting of which Ros- 
setti was one of the chief glories. These men, 
painters and poets alike, have been variously 
described as Pre-Raphaelites, members of the 
stained-glass school, apostles of medievalism 
and of Renaissance art. No one of the epithets 
is exact or comprehensive, but all are at least 
suggestive of the aims and methods of the ex- 
traordinary group of men of genius to whom 
they are applied. And of the three poets con- 
cerned it is to be noted that Morris was the first 
to make himself heard. " The Defence of 
Guenevere" was published in 1858 ; three years 
later came Rossetti's " Early Italian Poets," 
and Mr. Swinburne's " Rosamond " and kt The 
Queen Mother." It was not until 1870 that 
Rossetti's first collection of original poems was 
exhumed from the grave of his wife and given 
to the world. When we examine the total 
poetical product of the three men, we find a 
wide differentiation of achievement, although 
a common impulse and common sympathies 



210 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



may be detected at their starting-points. The 
dramatic genius, the political and ethical pas- 
sion, displayed by Mr. Swinburne in his ma- 
turer work, are without a parallel in the work 
of Morris ; nor did the latter long remain tram- 
melled by the mysticism and the spiritual sub- 
tlety that were characteristic of Rossetti's poetry 
to the last. As for comparison with Arnold, 
Browning, and Tennyson, it is clean out of the 
question. These men felt the whole burden of 
the modern world, were oppressed by its enig- 
mas, and looked toward the future rather than 
the past. Morris, on the other hand, found all 
his inspiration in the past, and the golden age 
of which he sang was envisaged as a rever- 
sion rather than as a progressive evolution. 
"Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time," 
he called himself ; and, man of affairs that he 
became and remained to outward seeming, his 
inner life was always attuned to the simpler 
harmonies of the naive older world. 

The plan and craftsmanship of " The Earthly 
Paradise," the work by which Morris is best 
known, are such as to make inevitable some 
comparison with " The Canterbury Tales," and 
the author has frequently been described as a 
modern Chaucer. The ascription of this title 
has a certain rough external value, but little 
more. Certainly we may say that " The Earthly 
Paradise " is the only work in all English lit- 
erature to challenge comparison with "The 
Canterbury Tales." Nearly five hundred years 
had to elapse after the death of Chaucer before 
England could produce his peer as a story-teller 
by right divine. But the similarity does not 
extend far beyond this fact. Chaucer's tales 
were in their essence prophetic rather than 
retrospective ; they heralded the coming glories 
of English literature, they were in a sense the 
precursors of the Elizabethan drama and the 
modern novel. The tales told by Morris have 
in common with them little except the qualities 
of easy rhythm and noble diction that belong 
to all great poetry, and the fact that they 
are tales and not subjective outpourings. Of 
the wit, the shrewdness, the practical good 
sense, the dramatic faculty, and the insight into 
the recesses of individual character displayed 
by Chaucer, there is very little to be found in 
Morris ; but we find instead the conception of 
men as types rather than individuals, the fresh 
and simple outlook upon nature, the very breath 
and finer spirit of all romance. We find, too, 
a curious blend of Hellenism with medieval- 
ism, or rather an amalgam of the elements of 
pure beauty common to both styles, the objec- 



tivity, the simplicity, and the grace of an art 
hardly tinged with self-consciousness and inno- 
cent of any concealed ulterior motive. 

Pure beauty may indeed be taken as the note 
of all the poetry that William Morris has left 
for the enrichment of our literature. "Full 
of soft music and familiar olden charm," to 
use Mr. Stedman's felicitous phrase, it has the 
power to lull the senses into forgetfulness of 
this modern workaday world, to restore the soul 
with draughts from the wellsprings of life, to 
bring back the wonder of childhood, the glory 
and the dream that we may perhaps have 
thought to be vanished beyond recall. It is 
poetry to read in the long summer days when 
we seek rest from strenuous endeavor ; it is 
poetry for the beguilement of all weariness, and 
for the refreshment of our faith in the simple 
virtues and the unsophisticated life ; it is poe- 
try that brings a wholesome and healing min- 
istry akin to that of Nature herself ; it is poetry 
that leaves the recollection unsullied by any 
suggestion of impurity and unhaunted by any 
spectre of doubt. Like Lethe, it has the gift 
of oblivion for those who seek the embrace of 
its waters ; but, unlike the dark-flowing stream 
of the underworld, its surface is rippled by the 
breezes of earth, its banks are overarched by 
living foliage, and its waves mirror the glad 
sunlight. This rich treasure of song includes 
the tentative first volume of miscellaneous 
poems, the great epic of " The Life and Death 
of Jason," the twenty-four tales of the wan- 
derers who sought, but did not find, " The 
Earthly Paradise," the "morality" of "Love is 
Enough," the story of " Sigurd the Volsung," 
and the volume of " Poems by the Way." To 
this list we should also add the versions of the 
" Odyssey " and the "^JEneid," which are great 
English poems, whatever may be said of them 
as translations. 

We have thus far made no mention of the 
group of works in which the genius of the poet 
found a new medium of expression during the 
last few years of his life. There is nothing in 
English literature sufficiently like them to be 
put in the same class with the series of five 
books that began with " The House of the 
Wolfings " and ended, shortly before the au- 
thor's death, with " The Well at the World's 
End." These romances mingle formal poetry 
with a sort of poetic prose that has all the qual- 
ities of poetry save metre, and that does not 
err this is a very important point by any 
approach to rhythmical regularity. Mr. Watts- 
Dunton says the final word upon the subject : 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



211 



" While the poet's object is to arouse in the listener 
an expectancy of csesuric effects, the great goal before 
the writer of poetic prose is in the very opposite direc- 
tion ; it is to make use of the concrete figures and impas- 
sioned diction that are the poet's vehicle, but at the same 
time to avoid the expectancy of metrical bars. The mo- 
ment that the regular bars assert themselves and lead 
the reader's ear to expect other bars of the like kind, 
sincerity ends." 

Of poetic prose in the true sense are these 
romances chiefly made, and their beauty is as 
absolute, in its own way, as the beauty of the 
avowed poems. We may speak of these books 
as a class by repeating what we said some years 
ago in a review of one of them " The Story of 
the Glittering Plain." "The reader of Mr. 
Morris's first volume of poems might have dis- 
cerned therein glimpses of the author's affinities 
for an art even less sophisticated than the 
Chaucerian, and of the ideals of a still more 
primitive age. The subsequent development 
of the author's genius has made this clear 
enough, and the types of thought and speech 
which he has delighted to embody have grown 
more and more archaic and remote. He has 
found the true springtime of the world, not 
even in the poems of Homer, but in the sagas 
of Iceland, in the conditions of Teutonic life 
of which Tacitus affords us a glimpse, and in 
the still more primeval regions which myth and 
folk-lore enable us to penetrate. And he has 
developed a style in keeping with the life which 
he depicts, a style which has permitted him to 
translate the saga literature as it was never 
translated before, a style of severe and noble 
simplicity from which the Latin element of the 
language is all but wholly banished." 

In the foregoing characterization of Morris, 
he has been considered simply as an English 
man of letters, with no reference to the many 
activities that he associated with the pursuit of 
literature. In a strict sense, of course, poetry 
was his avocation, just as it was with Oliver 
Wendell Holmes ; but the world will remember 
the poet in both cases long after it has forgot- 
ten the professor of medicine and the master 
of decorative design. Yet if Morris had writ- 
ten no books he would have been one of the 
most noteworthy men of his time, and his labors 
in the field of the practical arts would have 
earned for him the warmest gratitude of all 
who are struggling to make the world better 
worth living in. In the department of house- 
hold decoration he has exerted a wide influence 
for good ; by means of the famous Kelmscott 
Press, he has done much to develope the pub- 
lic taste for books that are mechanically works 



of art ; as the advocate of what are probably 
impossible ideals of social organization, he has 
done much to stimulate the moral sense of 
Englishmen, and persuade them that ours is 
by no means the best of all possible civiliza- 
tions. He has lived a great and a good life, 
in the best sense a life of service to mankind, 
and his death is a loss which it would be diffi- 
cult to exaggerate. 

BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. 
William Morris was born at Walthamstow, near 
London, in the year 1834. The eldest son of a merchant 
whose early death left ample provision for the family, 
the boy was given the education of an English gentle- 
man, and upon leaving Oxford, found himself free to 
choose a profession. Tentative efforts were made in 
painting and architecture, but soon abandoned. Poetry 
proved a kinder mistress, however, and " The Defence 
of Guenevere and Other Poems," published in 1858 
(republished 1875), apprised the few who found the 
book out that a new force had appeared in English litera- 
ture. In 1863, in conjunction with Rossetti, Ford Madox 
Brown, and Edward Burne- Jones, he started his famous 
London establishment for the designing of wall-paper 
and other household decorations, and engaged continu- 
ously in this business for the remainder of his life. But 
if his vocation was decorative art, his avocation was 
literature. " The Life and Death of Jason " was 
published in 1867, and the twenty-four tales of " The 
Earthly Paradise" from 1868 to 1870. "Love is 
Enough," a " morality," appeared in 1872, and " The 
Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Nib- 
lungs " in 1876. " Poems by the Way," his last volume 
of original poetry, is dated 1892. Translations of the 
" JEneid " and " Odyssey," respectively, appeared in 
1876 and 1887. Icelandic literature was a life-long 
study with Morris, and an extensive series of transla- 
tions from the sagas, made in collaboration with Pro- 
fessor Eirikr Magnusson, attest his industry in this 
direction. They include the"Grettis Saga" (1869), 
the "Volsunga Saga" (1870), "Three Northern Love- 
Stories and Other Tales " (1875), and the volumes of 
" The Saga Library," of which five have been issued 
(1891-95), including, among others, the " Eyrbyggja 
Saga " and the " Heimskringla." Of late years Morris 
has been writing sagas and medieval romances of his 
own, the list comprising " The House of the Wolfings " 
(1889), "The Roots of the Mountains" (1890), "The 
Story of the Glittering Plain" (1891), "The Wood 
beyond the World" (1894), and "The Well at the 
World's End " (1896), which appeared a few days be- 
fore his death. In 1895 he published a translation 
of " Beowulf." Morris was a socialist, although of a 
type neither practical nor revolutionary, and his writ- 
ings upon this subject include " A Dream of John Ball " 
(1888), "News from Nowhere" (1892), and "Socialism: 
Its Growth and Outcome" (1893), the latter work 
written in conjunction with Mr. Belfort Bax. " Hopes 
and Fears for Art," a collection of five lectures, appeared 
in 1881. Of late years he has devoted much of his time 
to bookmaking in the mechanical sense, and the pro- 
ducts of his Kelmscott Press are among the most cher- 
ished possessions of bibliophiles. He died Saturday 
morning, the third of October, and was buried the fol- 
lowing Wednesday.

THE DIAL, 



[Oct. 16, 



GEORGE DUMAURIER. 

The author of " Trilby " died in London on the 
eighth of this month, at the age of sixty-two. Had 
his death occurred five years ago, the news would 
have made some stir in artistic circles, hut a literary 
journal would hardly have been called upon to so 
much as mention it. To-day, his death means the 
loss of a widely-read novelist, and is a cause of gen- 
uine grief to many thousands who had never heard 
of him until he was nearly sixty years old. His con- 
tribution to literature consisted, as everybody knows, 
of "Peter Ibbetson," "Trilby," and "The Mar- 
tian," the latter of these three novels being now in 
course of serial publication in " Harper's Magazine." 
The astonishing popularity of " Trilby " in this coun- 
try (for the book had no such vogue anywhere else) 
was the result of a " craze " rather than of a genu- 
ine recognition of the meritorious qualities of that 
novel. What it was that caught the American fancy 
whether the hypnotism of Svengali, or the bare 
feet of the heroine, or the eccentricities of her three 
champions is not easy to determine, but it is quite 
certain that the success of the book was not won 
upon rational grounds. To a judge of literature, 
indeed, " Trilby " had admirable qualities, but the 
things that attracted popular attention were the 
accidental features of the work, and even the blots 
upon its execution. Its unconventional and ama- 
teurish qualities were condoned by the critic for the 
sake of the rich and genial nature that found ex- 
pression in its pages. One could not help feeling 
that here was a talent akin to that of Thackeray, 
and there was no lack of charitable allowance for 
the fact that the author was a beginner in literature. 
" Peter Ibbetson," which came before " Trilby," is 
thought by some to be the better novel of the two, 
but in this j udgment we cannot concur. As for " The 
Martian," comparison is as yet out of the question. 
Du Maurier appears to have been a singularly lov- 
able man, and his readers felt that they were brought 
into unusually intimate relations with his personal- 
ity. For this reason particularly his death brings 
with it a sense of loss quite out of proportion to the 
importance of his literary achievements. 



ORIGINALITY IN LITERA TURE. 

On the appearance of a new force in literature, 
the critics constitute the conservative element in 
appraising the work and giving it its place; the 
public, poor giddy-headed thing, not seldom jumps 
at what is to its taste, swallowing it whole in a gusto 
of unthinking dietetic delectation. But they whose 
sacred function it is to be at once Radamanthus and 
Mercury, stern judge and messenger of good to men, 
are not so easily caught, and at once begin to apply 
tests and standards. These are likely to be tradi- 
tional and well-defined: the canons of an estab- 
lished literary development, the criteria not of yes- 



terday but of generations and centuries. The new 
aspirants who win critical favor, moreover, are gen- 
erally bound to do good work within these recognized 
and well-defined limits. This is natural, and of 
easy solution : it is always a plainer task to judge a 
given thing by some standard of common agree- 
ment, while it is folly to deny that a residuum of 
truth is here ; familiar accents are those best loved 
by even the critical ear. When the pioneers of lit- 
erary expression or of form appear, they it is who, 
as a rule, fare hardest at the hands of the critical 
class, even if the broad republic of readers be not 
deaf to the message. Temporary fluctuations there 
are, to be sure, when it becomes a fad to hail the 
bizarre novelty, the fresh voice ; and our own time 
is an illustration of this. When a Francis Thomp- 
son emerges from the purlieu of obscurity, with the 
welcome drapery of a mysterious and romantic 
career about him, bringing the world (in his initial 
volume) the raw material of poetry rather than 
poetry itself, the furore he creates is of so exag- 
gerated a type, both among cultured readers and 
critics themselves, as to suggest the theory of the 
new for the new's sake pushed ad absurdum. But 
even to-day, a Francis Thompson could not win the 
consensus of critical opinion as to take another 
modern and strictly contemporaneous instance 
could a William Watson. In the latter 's verse is 
to be seen the culture of the schools, the methods of 
Wordsworth and Tennyson, the sobriety and bal- 
ance of a great and accredited tradition in English 
poetry. Hence, while he is written down as " lit- 
erary," his place is secured quicker and more surely 
than that of a bard whose manner is more violently 
individual and whose literary lineage is less plainly 
to be traced. On the one hand, then, tradition is 
always at work, and (for a season at least) the work 
is most likely to win plaudits whose way is in ac- 
cordance with its tenets ; on the other hand, the 
rebellious, the daring and progressive, the icono- 
clastic maker of literature, blazing new paths and 
moving forward with an unwonted and uncouth 
gait, will in the nature of things have an unsmooth 
time and make slower progress. 

No objection to this class of innovations is more 
often brought to bear than that of affectation : it is 
a stumbling block for every new writer whose man- 
ner is markedly aside from the beaten way ; it is 
dinned into his ears, mayhap, until he become self- 
conscious, dropping what was a natural and legiti- 
mate mode of expression for that which, while more 
conventional, is for that very reason, for him, imi- 
tative and unnatural. If it happened that the new 
hand be resolute and independent enough to push 
on in indifference to these criticisms, in time its 
" affectation " will more likely than not be dubbed 
" originality," and the struggle be over. Blunt- 
schli's phrase, " Politics is present history and his- 
tory past politics," suggests the literary parallel: 
affectation is present originality, originality past 
affectation. Very often this apothegm is vindicated. 
Familiar examples in our day are afforded by poets

like Browning and Whitman. The English mas- 
ter's early and tentative efforts and his idiosyn- 
crasies were marked in such a cryptic work as 
" Sordello " found no audience, and he had to win 
his way slowly, not coming to conceded and wide 
recognition until middle-age had come, and the ap- 
proval he most cared for that of his wife was 
impossible, since she had passed " to where beyond 
these voices there is peace." But Robert Brown- 
ing held stoutly to his individuality cacophoneity, 
psychologic stress, obscurity, and all ; never abating 
jot or tittle of his faith or method, and leaving to 
the society formed to expound his verse the parlous 
task of explaining his meaning, when it lay beyond 
ordinary comprehension. Even long after he was 
ranked with Tennyson as chief singer of the Vic- 
torian era, yea, now when he is dead and his poetry 
is subject to the decree of Time, there be those who 
believe that his peculiarities were self-consciously 
wilful, that he was, in short, " affected." But the 
bulk of the best opinion will join the dictum of his 
idolators of the Browning Society in the decision 
that his manner was natural, his very own in an inti- 
mate'and organic sense ; that Browning is a stalwart 
specimen of the species Original. The case is some- 
what different with Whitman. Browning, with all his 
artistic blemishes, was, broadly viewed, a great artist: 
the Camden Seer for a long life-time deliberately 
refused to do his work after the prescribed rules of 
verse, eschewing rhyme, definite rhythm, the dic- 
tion and form of poetry, and the principle of artistic 
selection. He conquered, so far as he did conquer, 
by the natural music in him sounding forth in his 
irregularly rhythmic, half-prosaic dithyrambs, and 
by the picturesque virility and the large sweep of his 
thought and expression. But the point at issue is, 
What of the validity of this phenomenon ? Affecta- 
tion and originality are in turn attributed to him, 
according as the critic regards his mannerisms and 
extravagances as an integral and honest part of him, 
or as intentionally assumed, an art-pose for the sake 
of blague- Good men have taken either side : Mr. 
Burroughs and Mr. Swinburne the affirmative, Mr. 
Thompson and Mr. Gosse the negative. And much 
confusion there is at present concerning this formid- 
able individuality, who insistently demands some 
classification, yet on whom few are agreed. An inter- 
national society for the reverent study of his life 
and work is already founded, yet it is safe to say 
that it will be some years hence before his biography 
is included in our regular Men of Letters series. 

The whole question of affectation versus origi- 
nality, then, comes to this : Is a man's manner, his 
method of expression, natural and honest? If so, 
however contrary to the accepted theory, however 
shocking to experience and taste, he is to be studied 
on this major premise, and not to be refused a hear- 
ing. He is, to be sure, open to jealous and judicial 
judgment at the bar of Art, and indicted if found 
guilty. Whitman, in our opinion, must plead guilty 
to this indictment. But he cannot be refused a trial 
on the ground that he is & poseur. Past literary rec- 



ord declares that history will show this to be unfair 
and frequently wrong in the sequel ; moreover, it is 
evident that if traditional criticism be allowed to 
settle each new claimant's case, there can be no uni- 
form standard, for the very good reason that tradi- 
tions vary with the years and the current schools. 
Yesterday, classicism perhaps had sole sway ; to- 
day, romanticism has; to-morrow, realism may 
have ; the day after to-morrow, neo-romanticism ; 
none of them is all-perfect, all of them contain the 
millet seed of truth. And so the novitiate is the 
buffet of temporal canons. When the English poet- 
critic, Mr. Edmund Gosse, was lecturing in Balti- 
more, he took occasion to refer to the Southern poet, 
Sidney Lanier, whose connection with Johns Hop- 
kins University he knew, and whose medallion 
indeed looked at him from the wall as he spoke in 
terms of kindly but frank disapproval. He depre- 
cated what he called Lanier's " strained attempt to 
be original." The scene well furnishes a text for 
our sermon : the British critic, with his leaning to 
tradition and classicality in English poetry, utterly 
failed to grasp the seriousness, the spontaneity and 
the deep spiritual honesty of the American singer 
as man and poet, qualities precluding the possibility 
of his straining for effect or striving toward a fan- 
tastic originality. The literary bias of Mr. Gosse, 
and his unfamiliarity with Lanier as a man, disqual- 
ified his judgment, which already, ten years having 
elapsed, is being reversed by the best critical opin- 
ion, which awards the Georgian, half-accomplished 
and tentative as his work was, his place among the 
few masters of American song. 

But granting that this esoteric test of honesty be 
the safer one, how may we apply it? The objector 
might, not unnaturally, claim that the difficulty of 
judging a man's character in his work was quite as 
much open to the chance of error as are the fluctu- 
ating tests of more objective and conventional liter- 
ary criticism. But a little reflection will, we fancy, 
prove this to be otherwise. It is a pretty safe gen- 
eral proposition that a man's essential character can 
be gathered from his work ; the " real John " speaks 
there if anywhere. True, often the life is sadly in 
dissonance with the written profession or implica- 
tion : one thinks of Rousseau with his " Emile," let- 
ting his own illegitimate children die in the found- 
ling's hospital ; of Byron, frankly a roue and 
sensualist ; and of Bacon, wisest, meanest of man- 
kind. But we maintain that a good book (in the 
ethic sense) means a good man either in positive or 
potential. In the cases of those who blot their fair 
fame on the personal side with sins and shortcom- 
ings, we see men who were made for higher things, 
however out of tune and harsh under the fierce as- 
saults of the flesh or the lure of worldliness. As no- 
where else, such are sincere in their books. And when, 
in addition to the subtle testimony of the printed 
page that permanent registration of the inner 
spirit, the life of the writer, studied and analyzed 
in all its light and shade, its confusing minutiae and 
the significance of its rounded whole, is seen to be

beautiful and for the nonce blameless, there is set 
up a dual and cumulative surety that here is no pos- 
ing trickster, but a genuine and straightforward hu- 
man brother, with failings beyond doubt, but one 
lovable and trustworthy. And our great literary 
personalities can be thus studied, and should be, in 
order to reach any conclusion upon this vexed ques- 
tion of their affectation. 

The method of proof is thus that of literary crit- 
icism corrected by the study of personal character. 
Such a matter as the honesty or dishonesty of man- 
nerisms can only be settled in this way. Apply the 
test of life to the literature of a Browning, a Whit- 
man, or a Meredith, and much of the criticism which, 
reversing the habit of the court, assumes the pris- 
oner guilty until he proves his innocence, will be 
exposed in all its nugatory superficiality.

COMMUNIGA TIONS. 

A WORLD-ANTHOLOGY OF LYRIC POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The earnest lover of poetry, in his desire to become 
intimately acquainted with " that great Poem which all 
poets, like the cooperating thoughts of one great mind, 
have built up since the beginning of the world " (Shel- 
ley, quoted by Palgrave), finds, firstly, that much of it 
is inaccessibly locked up in foreign literatures ; secondly, 
that contemporary additions of value, though more ac- 
cessible, must frequently wait years before being brought 
to his notice by the collectors of anthologies, who, besides, 
necessarily omit much that is good. He may approxi- 
mately keep pace with the additions in his own language, 
though his enjoyment will be marred by the necessity for 
reference work; but he can make no pretence, beyond 
a very limited one, of overcoming the first obstacle. 

In the latter respect, the art of poetry is exceptional 
in the hindrances to its progress. Music, sculpture, 
painting, and inventions have no limitations of language, 
but at once become common property so far as their 
benefits are concerned. The obstacle of inaccessibility 
is, indeed, insurmountable by the general public. But 
when we consider the relative importance, for the devel- 
opment of literature, of that class of readers whose 
members, though few, may become leaders of taste and 
culture, and that, if each foreign language possessed a 
collection of but half the value which Palgrave's " Golden 
Treasury " might have by being brought down to the 
present year, the probability that the thin veil of Teu- 
tonic and Romance languages would deter few of our 
leaders from assimilating those collections, and thus 
other languages represented would find more readers 
than at present, when we consider these propositions, 
the thoughts arise that a World-Anthology of Lyric 
Poetry, even in a pot-pourri of the original languages, 
would fill a want; and if the scheme of the collection 
were such as to admit of organic increase from year to 
year, we could then say that our literary culture was not 
behind our science in its mechanical helps. The culti- 
vated of all nations would be drawn together by observ- 
ing their own place and that of their neighbors in the 
most sacred activity of the mind. Whatever shape may 
be taken by the re-flowering of poetry prophesied by 



Mr. Stedman, it will be powerfully influenced by the 
standard of excellence previously adopted. Such a 
standard cannot but be raised by a more faithful absorp- 
tion of the best the world has to give. 

The project thus suggested is doubtless too formid- 
able to be in its perfection other than an ideal in our 
time. But by judicious limitations we may bring the 
essential features within range of our immediate powers. 
I have in my mind's eye a volume, or rather volumes, 
consisting of a text and a bulky appendix. The text 
consists of lyric selections of all periods in the most 
important literary languages, dead as well as living. 
The term " lyric " here applies to the spirit, not the 
form; for the selections, besides complete poems, include 
many passages from longer poems of all kinds, not ex- 
cluding blank verse. All are characterized by unob- 
trusiveness of art, inevitableness, and absolute sincerity ; 
and by a degree of simplicity, intensity of feeling, ex- 
cellence of expression, and concentration. They are 
largely of that kind of poetry which appeals to the heart 
directly, rather than to the heart through the intellect, 
according to the pithy distinction made by a reviewer in 
THE DIAL. The appendix includes all of the poems 
(when short, and good enough) from which passages 
were quoted in the text; other poems that have excel- 
lence but are shut out of the text by the severe stand- 
ard adopted; and necessary annotations, including prose 
translations when deemed advisable. The characteristic 
of the text is poetic intensity; that of the appendix, an 
attempt at scholarly completeness. Most of the labor 
of preparing the appendix may be relegated to future 
years, or the next generation. 

The selections in the text, in this imagined volume, 
are not arranged according to periods, it is assumed 
that ultimately the poems themselves are more precious 
than their minor traits ; that the readers of such a work 
already possess the requisite historical knowledge. Log- 
ical and artistic arrangement throughout is regarded as 
an essential feature of the presentation of that Poem of 
the World referred to by Shelley. Nevertheless, poems 
of different periods are not indiscriminately mixed. 
Much of the work is naturally composed of sub-groups, 
each containing poems of a separate period. An exam- 
ple (necessarily very imperfect, for the work does not ex- 
ist) may best illustrate: A few of a certain class of love- 
poems would probably be arranged as in the following 
list of first lines, in which the affinities of the Eliza- 
bethan poems for each other are at once seen: " Ich 
denke Deiu " (Goethe); "En Avril ou naquit amour" 
(Jean de la Taille); " Im wunderschouen Monat Mai " 
(Heine); " Elle e*tait bien jolie " (Charles Nodier); 
"Her arms across her breast she laid" (Tennyson); 
"Leise zieht durch mein Gemiith " (Heine); "Vitas 
hinnuleo me similis " (Horace); "Du schones Fischer- 
madchen" (Heine); " Ich hab' ein kleines Hiittchen " 
(J. W. L. Gleim); "Hue ades O Galatea" (Vergil); 
and the corresponding passage of Theocritus; "Come 
down, O maid " (Tennyson) ; " Here she was wont to 
go! and here! and here! " (Ben Jonson) ; a passage from 
the song of Daphnis in the sixth idyll of Theocritus; 
" O mistress mine, where are you roaming ? " (Shake- 
peare); "Come live with me and be my love" (Mar- 
lowe); "Pack, clouds, away" (Heywood); " It was a 
lover and his lass " (Shakespeare) ; " Crabbed Age and 
Youth " (Shakespeare) ; " Fair, and fair, and twice so 
fair" (Peele); "Gin a body meet a body"; " Nach 
Sevilla" (Brentano); "Bonnie lassie, will you go" 
(Burns) ; " If love were what the rose is " (Swinburne) ;

"To-day what is there in the air" (Marzials); " Dass 
du mich liebst, das wusst' ich " (Heine); " Wie heisat 
Konig Ringangs Tochterlein ? " (Morike); "Quel vago 
impallidir, che'l dolce riso" (Petrarch); " Aennehen

blast" (Burns); "O my luve's like a red, red rose" 
(Burns); "She walks in beauty" (Byron); " Maxwel- 
ton braes are bonny" (Lady John Scott). 

One who has not tried it can have but little idea of 
the pleasant surprises, the unsuspected combinations, 
side-lights, and mutual reinforcement of emotions, the 
clear outlook over the excellences of each literature, and 
the satisfaction of keeping up with the times, which are 
the result of collecting and classifying material at hand 
in even a few languages. And more: the work as a 
whole will be a grand lyrical drama, emphasizing the 
unity of humanity. It would be a cause for congratu- 
lation if the impulse and beginning of a movement of 
art no less important than that cultivated at Bayreuth 
should come from America. p j^ THOMPSON

PROOF IN LITERARY USAGE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The correspondent who discussed the subject of proof 
in literary 'usage in your last issue seems unaware that, 
while asking what constitutes proof, he is in effect pre- 
cluding proof. When we say that a given usage is his- 
torical, he replies that history is irrelevant- when we ex- 
hibit the evidence that it is present, he maintains that our 
evidence is occasional. Without going into the com- 
plete theory of proof, there is no doubt that argument 
must be addressed to the issue as made; and I may be 
pardoned for recalling that this is just what I endeav- 
ored to urge and to illustrate in my brief letter in THE 
DIAL of July 16, entitled " Journalistic Retribution." 

The mere dogmatist may with simple denial be dis- 
missed to his prejudices and predilections: to the claim- 
ant that reason or analogy forbids this or that combina- 
tion, it is enough to show that this or that combination 
is or has at some time been reasonable in some tongues 
and has its recognized parallels in our own ; to him who 
maintains that illustrations of a given locution cited 
from representative authors are exceptional, the cita- 
tions may be multiplied, or a confident and competent 
observer is warranted in diverting the burden to the ob- 
jector: to him who arrays authorities, their admitted 
fallibility in other issues may be demonstrated, while 
other authorities may be pitted against his host, after an 
asserted and exemplified present, national, and reputable 
usage is discredited as exceptional. 

Of course, rhetoric changes; and usage remains the 
only test of usage, without which authority is puerile 
and reason and analogy are inadequate, while dogma 
and prejudice are always insignificant. In view of a 
recognized and prevailing grammatical principle, an 
occasional violation is not usage, a regular or approxi- 
mately regular violation is usage; hence Hawthorne's 
whomsoever as subject is the former, while " who did you 
see ? " is the latter, in spite of any alleged authority, 
analogy, reason, or predilection. It is notable that ob- 
jectors, even while accepting the arbitrament of usage, 
insist on regarding as occasional illustrations they dis- 
like without the trouble of a fair count. It is in point 
to refer to the recent discussion of, " Who was given a 
seat," which I believe I can illustrate overwhelmingly 
from any author in any form of literature valid for pres- 
ent usage, as well as from the irresponsible periodical 



publications. Indeed, the irony of fate " pede Poena 
claudo " has recently overtaken our friend " The Book- 
man," who in his September issue (page 78) writes "We 
are accorded an insight." In the play of " Caste," when 
the marchioness, whose universe is her visiting list, says, 
" There are no such people as Eccles ! " the aged bac- 
chanalian who owns that name rejoins, " Well, marm, 
I takes the liberty of hexistin' notwithstandin' ! " Usage 
is like old Eccles. CASKIE HARRISON.

AN ILLOGICAL INFERENCE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A correspondent in your issue of October 1 has done 
me the honor of glancing over my excursus on " Dog- 
matic Philology" (THE DIAL, Sept. 1, pp. 109-110), 
but his comments show that he could not have read it 
carefully, for there is nothing in my communication 
that can, by any logical inference, be brought into oppo- 
sition to the views which he, in common with every 
other sane man, holds. I agree with him entirely in the 
three main points he makes: (a) that the correct usage 
of a former period of the language, as in Shakespeare, 
Milton, Addison, is no proof of the correctness of pres- 
ent usage; (b) that the use of an idiom in one language 
does not justify a similar use in another; (c) that an 
array of blunders culled here and there from the works 
of reputable authors cannot be used to establish proof 
of the correctness of these expressions. But I am at a 
loss to know what he found in my article that was at 
variance with these trite observations, or that would 
warrant an issue with me on these points. 

He asks, " Does not the writer assume that rhetoric 
never changes ? Does he not accept an idiom in one 
language as evidence of acceptable usage in another 
tongue ? What pertinency is there otherwise to his quo- 
tations from Sophocles, Chateaubriand, or even from 
Spenser and Milton ? " 

In the discussion of the phrase " in our midst " there 
was involved necessarily the use of the possessive adjec- 
tive in the objective sense; and to show that this was 
not an isolated fact in English, I quoted, from Latin, 
Greek, French, and German classics, examples of similar 
usage. This, it was thought, would certainly not weaken 
the argument. When it came to treating the phrase 
under discussion as an English idiom, I went back to the 
Anglo-Saxon, following the historical method, and sup- 
porting the position by three quotations from Schiller's 
classic German, the only other Teutonic tongue, I regret 
to say, that I am familiar enough with to quote. Since 
then, I have noticed that Dr. Fitzedward Hall (" Mod- 
ern English," p. 49) cites an example from Middle 
English, " in her middis, that is to say, in their midst," in 
support of the genuineness of the idiom. I went a little 
farther back, to Old English; that is all. 

And again, in combatting the statement of the rhet- 
orician that " is gone " is not idiomatic, I referred to 
Anglo-Saxon and German in vindication of its rights. 
In matters of English idiom one cannot get away from 
one's grandmother tongue, any more than in matters of 
heredity one can get away from one's grandfather. It is 
rather late in the day, however, to have to reiterate, in 
self-defence, this evident truth. 

As to " try and " instead of " try to," I did not " cull 
here and there from books of accepted authors," but 
quoted four examples from a single essay of one of the 
most modern of modern men of letters.

[Oct. 16, 



A SURVIVING CONTEMPORARY OF LAMB, 
KEATS, AND SHELLEY.* 

From Charles Lamb's day to ours seems a 
pretty far cry ; and it is a little startling to find 
a contemporary of our own who was also a con- 
temporary of his, chatting familiarly of him and 
his circle, very much as if she had parted from 
them the day before yesterday. Therein, and 
in a certain pleasant old-time primness of style 
that is perhaps a relic of early devotion to Rich- 
ardson's epistolary heroines, lies the chief 
charm of Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's cheery retro- 
spect of her " Long Life." From cover to cover 
the little book spans a wide interval of years 
and manners. In her girlhood the writer was 
the pupil of Mary Lamb of comparatively 
young Mary Lamb ; she remembers Keats, who 
as a boy had thrashed his way, more swo, to the 
top of her father-in-law's school at Enfield ; she 
had a glimpse of Shelley ; she was intimate 
with Leigh Hunt ; she saw Munden (Lamb's 
Munden ) in " Cockletop " and Liston in 
" Paul Pry"; she saw the Vestris in " Orpheus " 
" clad," she records, " in the smallest amount 
of clothing I had ever then seen upon the 
stage "; she knew Hazlitt well and Godwin 
slightly, and heard Coleridge hold forth melli- 
fluously on the " spheral music " at Highgate. 
A fair notion of the very old-time savor per- 
vading Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's earlier chapters 
may be conveyed by the following extract from 
the account of her wedding : 

" I remember rather wondering at my own perfect 
calmness during the service, for I had determined not 
to follow Charlotte Grandison's example of hesitation 
at saying the word obey,' but to speak the love, honor, 
and obey ' with the full tone that should express the 
true wish of my heart to faithfully keep this vow. Well 
might I, with such a man as he was who had chosen me, 
and whom I had long known, esteemed, respected, ad- 
mired, and warmly loved." 

Mrs. Cowden-Clarke was born at London on 
June 22, 1809. Her father, Vincent Novello, 
the noted composer, was for twenty-six years 
organist at the Portuguese Embassy's Chapel, 
whither his skill attracted a large and distin- 
guished concourse weekly. It used to be play- 
fully said of Mr. Novello that his " voluntaries," 
conventionally supposed to play the congrega- 
tion out, on the contrary kept them in, listen- 
ing till the very last note. Of her childhood 
Mrs. Cowden-Clarke gives a number of pleas-

Clarke. Illustrated New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



ing, if slight, reminiscences. That she was a 
very "proper" little girl, of (as the times went) 
conscientious bringing -up, a little incident 
shows. She had been asked to a children's 
party, where they were playing a round game 
of cards. 

" When the nursery-maid came to fetch me home, the 
lady of the house offered me some silver, saying: Take 
this seven-and-sixpence, you have won it.' < I thought,' 
I replied, 'that we were playing with counters; I saw 
them on the table, ma'am. I did not know we were 
playing for money. I have none, and could not have 
paid if I had lost. Therefore I can 't have won, and 
can 't take that silver.' When I went home and told 
my mother what had happened, she said: ' You did well 
to refuse the money, and gave the right reason [the italics 
are ours] for doing so.' " 

The Novellos' house in Oxford Street was 
naturally a resort of artists and literary people. 
" Elia " speaks passim of " the little household, 
cake - producing, wine - bringing out," of the 
"friendly supper -tray and draught of true 
Sutheran beer " that succeeded to the feasts 
of music provided by the host. Besides the 
artists Varley, Copley, Fielding, and others, 
Mrs. Cowden-Clarke remembers having seen 
in the little drawing-room the Lambs, Leigh 
Hunt, Keats many distinguished guests, for 
whom her childish enthusiasm was curiously 
strong. Shelley she had a peep at over the par- 
lor window-blind, as he was leaving the house 
after a visit to her father ; of which incident 
she says : 

" Well was I rewarded, for, as he passed before our 
house, he gave a glance up at it, and I beheld his seraph- 
like face, with its blue eyes, and aureoled by its golden 
hair." 

Keats she thus describes : 

" I have even now a full recollection of the reverent 
look with which I regarded him, as he leaned against 
the side of the organ, listening with rapt attention to 
my father's music. Keats's favorite position one foot 
raised on his other knee still remains imprinted on my 
memory; as also does the last time I saw him, half- 
reclining on some chairs that formed a couch for him 
when he was staying at Leigh Hunt's house, just before 
leaving England for Italy." 

It was while the Novellos were living in Bed- 
ford Square that our author became a pupil of 
Mary Lamb. Miss Lamb had volunteered to 
give her little friend lessons in Latin ; and the 
latter used, therefore, to trudge regularly at 
the appointed hour to Great Russell Street, 
where the Lambs then lived. One morning, 
on entering the room, she found a guest sitting 
with Miss Lamb, whom she heard say, " Oh, I 
am nothing now but a stocking-mending old 
woman." The speaker is thus described : 

" This lady had straight, black brows, and looked still

young, I thought, and had a very intelligent, expressive 
countenance. When she went away, Miss Lamb said, 
' That is the excellent actress, Miss Kelly. Look at 
her well, Victoria, for she is a woman to remember hay- 
ing seen. And, indeed, this was no other than the ad- 
mirable artiste to whom Charles Lamb addressed his 
two sonnets; the one beginning, 

' You are not Kelly of the common strain,' 
and the other, on her performance of ' The Blind Boy,' 
beginning, 

' Rare artist, who with half thy tools or none 
Canst execute with ease thy curious art.' " 

From Bedford Square the Novellos moved to 
Shacklewell ; and it was at this period that 
Mrs. Cowden-Clarke was sent to a school at 
Boulogne- sur-Mer, to acquire the French lan- 
guage. On returning from Boulogne, she be- 
came governess to the children of a Mr. Pur- 
cell ; and in 1826 she was affianced to Mr. 
Charles Cowden-Clarke, whom she had long 
known. They were married in 1828 ; and 
before settling down in London they spent a 
delightful Week with the Lambs at Enfield. 
Charles Lamb, one can readily believe, was the 
" cordialest of hosts, playful, genial, hospit- 
ably promotive of pleasurable things, walks, 
cheerful meals, and the very best of talk. Of 
his pranks there was no end ; and he really 
seems to have " gone through life " (as he said 
of his friend Rickman) " laughing at solemn 
apes." 

" His hospitality, while we were visiting him that 
memorable week, was characteristically manifested one 
day, in his own peculiarly whimsical way, by his starting 
up from dinner, hastening to the front garden gate, and 
opening it for a donkey that he saw standing there, and 
looking, as Lamb said, as if he wanted to come in and 
munch some of the grass growing so plentifully behind 
the railing." 

Another visit of signal interest was one paid 
by our author to Leigh Hunt (her " first poet," 
and the object of her childish adoration) at 
Highgate. She says : 

" I must have always had a touch of romance in my 
disposition, even as long back as when, quite a child, 
I had crept round the sofa to kiss his hand. . . . Thus 
to stay in the same house with him ; to be the companion 
of his walks about such charming environs; to listen to 
his confidential talk after breakfast, in his flowered 
morning-gown, when he would discuss with me his then 
literary projects in a style which showed he felt he had 
near him one who could understand and appreciate his 
avowed views, all formed a bewitching combination 
that rendered this visit indeed a memorable one to me. 
He was then full of a project for writing a book to be 
called ' Fabulous Zoology,' which was to treat of dragons, 
griffins, cockatrices, basilisks, etc." 

When the Cowden-Clarkes first settled in 
London, Charles was writing for the news- 
papers, the "Examiner" among others, for 
which he wrote the theatrical notices. This 



engagement, says our author, " afforded us most 
congenial entertainment for our evenings, since 
it took us perpetually to the different theatres." 
It was a day of great actors, and they saw the 
best of them, Edmund Kean, for instance. Of 
Kean's famous " Sir Giles Overreach " Mrs. 
Cowden-Clarke remembers chiefly the death- 
scene. 

" He lay prostrate near the footlights, his face and 
figure clearly visible to the audience, and fearfully true 
to the ebbing of life was the picture they presented. In 
' Othello ' a striking point was the mode in which he 
clung to the side-scene when uttering the words, ' Not a 
jot, not a jot,' in Act III., scene 3, as if trying to steady 
himself against the life-blow he was receiving. Towards 
the latter part of his career, Kean most frequently 
played ' Shylock,' and grand was his playing throughout. 
But a superb piece of action and voice was his, as he 
delivered the speech, concluding with the words ' The 
villainy you teach me, I will execute; and it shall go 
hard, but I will better the instruction.' He seemed 
positively to writhe from head to foot as he poured 
forth his anguished recapitulation of his own and his 
nation's wrongs, and of his as deadly determination to 
have his revenge upon them." 

Of Kean and Listen a humorous story is re- 
corded apropos of a wager laid by the latter 
that he could make Kean laugh even on the 
stage, despite his boast that nothing could upset 
his gravity while there. 

" Once, when Kean was playing ' Holla,' a procession 
of veiled Virgins of the Sun had to enter and pass be- 
fore him. The first virgin, as she passed, suddenly 
raised her veil, confronted Kean with the irresistible 
visage of Liston, and the wager was won, for Kean went 
off into an uncontrollable fit of laughter." 

The evenings at the theatres brought the 
Cowden-Clarkes and Hazlitt (then dramatic 
critic for the " Times ") often together. Haz- 
litt's gift in painting, the author says, was

the upper part of the face in strong shadow from an

the wrinkled cheeks, the lines about the mouth, with 
the touches of actual and reflected light, were given with 
such vigor and truth as well might recall the style of 
the renowned Flemish master, and actually did cause a 
good judge of the art to say to Hazlitt, ' Where did you

It was about a year after her marriage that

We may quote here from what she has to say, in

" I may here take occasion to say that all my experi- 
ence of publishers has been most agreeable. Contrary 
to the prejudiced opinion sometimes expressed, that 
authors and publishers are often antagonistic in their 
transactions, I have invariably met with courtesy and 
kindness. ... I must not omit to record that from 
American publishers I have also received tokens of 
marked regard. Messrs. Munro, Messrs. Roberts of 
Boston, Mr. G. P. Putnam, and Messrs. Appleton of 
New York, have each and all shown me much that proves 
the courtesy of publishers to authors." 

Mrs. Cowden-Clarke has some kind words to 
say of Douglas Jerrold. 

" Hardly a greater mistake could be made than to 
attribute bitterness or ill-nature to Jerrold's sharpest 
sarcasms, as sometimes was the case by those who merely 
heard of them and did not know his real nature. We 
who did know him understood them better. He was 
deeply earnest in all serious things, and very much in 
earnest when dealing with less apparently important 
matters which he thought needed the scourge of a sar- 
casm. His concern for the object of his satirical quips 
was often at the root of them ; and he would pour forth 
his keen flights of pointed arrows chiefly with the view 
of rousing to improvement his butt, whom he knew capa- 
ble of better things, and on whom the shafts of his rid- 
icule might tell to good purpose rather than harm. . . . 
As a token of his belief that he was entirely understood 
and appreciated by my Charles and me, I may mention 
that when he brought his ' Mrs. Caudle's Lectures ' as a 
presentation copy to me, he had written in its blank page, 
Presented with great timidity, but equal regard, to 
Mrs. Cowden-Clarke, by Douglas Jerrold.' " 

Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's later chapters contain 
some interesting references to literary people, 
and artists of more modern vogue, whom she 
met at home and abroad ; but we must forbear 
transplanting any more of her "purple patches" 
to our own pages. Enough has been quoted, 
we trust, to send the reader expectantly to her 
pleasant little book. It contains a frankly, 
almost naively, told life-story, sweet with the 
pervading suggestion of sunny days, warm 
friends, and wholesome thoughts ; and might 
well bear on its dainty title-page as a motto the 
device on Hazlitt's Venetian sun-dial : " Horas 
non numero nisi serenas " (I count only the 
hours that are serene). The volume is prettily 
made and well printed though there are two 
or three unfortunate misprints, as " match " for 
march, on page 67 ; " Murot " for Marot, on 
page 56 ; and " Eanch's " for Ranch's, on page 
203. There are several portraits, including an 
attractive one of the author. E. G. J.

BOOKS AND THEIR MAKERS.* 

That a good sized volume of four hundred 
and fifty pages may be written concerning 
books and their makers in the middle ages 
attests at least a considerable degree of mental 
activity during that period of time, even if 
most of such intellectual energy was result- 
ant in character, and not of a constructive and 
original quality. The medieval product in book 
manufacture appears truly enormous, when the 
means and methods are considered. The great 
collection of Muratori in Italy, of Dom Bouquet 
in France, the Rolls Series in England, the 
Monumenta of German history, not to speak 
of the vast body of writing comprised in Migne, 
all together comprise a mass of matter aggre- 
gating nearly four hundred folio volumes. 

One may reasonably expect a book about 
books to be bookish ; and the relative sterility of 
mediaeval thought may intensify that quality. 
Mr. Putnam has been very bookish indeed. He 
has told us much that is of interest and profit, 
and has given much detail regarding the meth- 
ods of writing, the regime that prevailed in the 
monasteries, the work of the universities. But 
little is said of the men who wrote the books. 
In a word, the makers and the men receive a 
small amount of observation. Books are to 
our author the concrete substance rather than 
a potential personality. But the rationale of 
medieval thought is not so far removed from 
the manner of expression and preservation of 
that thought as the work before us has divorced 
them. A book is a personality, and much me- 
diaBval writing was original, even if crude. The 
maker is behind the thing made. A study of 
the condition of the production and distribu- 
tion of literature from the decline of the Roman 
Empire also involves a study of condition and 
development of thought, and the personal his- 
tory of the men who formed that thought, as 
well as a consideration of resources and method 
of manufacture. 

The mere preservation of classic literature, 
the copying of the Vulgate Bible and homilies 
of the church fathers, or the writing of saints' 
lives, were not the whole devotion of mediaeval 
scribes. What of Gregory of Tours and Nith- 
ard in Frankish history ? of Frodoard and 
Richer and Suger in France? of Rodolph of 
Fulda, remarkable as the only mediaeval writer 
to whom Tacitus was known at first-hand? The

history of the recovery by Pertz of the lost man- 
uscript of Richer, mouldy and dilapidated, in 
the cathedral library of Bamberg, is a romantic 
story with the higher beauty of truth attached 
to it. Suger is remarkable as the earliest 
French chronicler to whom the advisability of 
using the French language instead of Latin, 
in the Chroniques de /Saint-Denis, suggested 
itself. Instead of the meagre paragraph in 
notice of Dunstan, whole pages might have been 
made luminous in telling of him. The man 
whose influence along intellectual lines pene- 
trated as far into later English history as the 
time of the Reformation was greater than the 
books written in Glastonbury, or than the cu- 
rious manuscript believed by some to have been 
wrought by Dunstan's own finger- joints. 

As the history of modern book-making dates 
from Gutenberg, so that of the middle ages 
must be dated from the establishment of the 
monastery of Monte Cassino by St. Benedict 
in 529. The agencies to which were due the 
maintenance of intellectual interest and liter- 
ary activities during this period of nine centu- 
ries were three in number, and these three con- 
veniently separate the period into three stages. 

" During the first, the responsibility for the preser- 
vation of the old-time literature, and for keeping alive 
some continuity of intellectual life, rested solely with 
the monasteries, and the work of multiplying and dis- 
tributing such books as had survived was carried on by 
the monks, and by them only. During the second stage, 
the older universities, the organization of which had 
gradually been developed from schools (themselves 
chiefly of monastic origin), became centres of intellec- 
tual activity and shared with the monasteries the work 
of producing books. The books emanating from the 
university scribes were, however, for the most part re- 
stricted to a few special classes, classes which had, as a 
rule, not been produced in the monasteries and . . . 
the university booksellers were in the earlier period not 
permitted to engage in any general distribution of books. 
With the third stage of manuscript literature, book- 
producing and book-selling machinery came into exist- 
ence in the towns, and the knowledge of reading being 
no longer confined to the cleric or the magister, books 
were prepared for the use of the large circles of the 
community, and to meet the requirements of such circles 
were, to an extent increasing with each generation, writ- 
ten in the tongue of the people" (pp. 9-10). 

The preservation and dissemination of 
thought in the western world in the middle 
ages was almost wholly dependent upon the 
work of the monks. Mr. Putnam gives a full 
and exact account of the preparation of mate- 
rials and the process of writing. Since Mont- 
alembert. indebtedness to the " Monks of the 
West " for the preservation of the literary her- 
itage of Europe has been clearly recognized. 
That almost inspired clause in the Rule of St. 



Benedict, providing that " He who does not 
turn up the earth with the plough ought to 
write the parchment with his fingers," saved 
Western Europe. It directed the entire intel- 
lectual activity of the time and much of the 
physical energy. The monk was a civilizer. 
He built his retreat by a marsh or in a forest 
because it was trial so to live. The Rule re- 
quired him to labor, and if he did not write he 
labored with his hands, draining the fens and 
cutting down the forest. Not a little of the 
intellectual product, however, of the monks was 
due to negative motives. It was a common 
form of penance particularly in the darkest 
period, the ninth and tenth centuries to im- 
pose the writing of a certain amount of " copy "; 
and slovenly work the writer sometimes made 
of it. The variant readings in classic litera- 
ture which to-day vex and perplex scholars are 
many of them due to the carelessness of some 
half-hearted or disciplined inmate of a monas- 
tery, who, working away in a cold cell unpro- 
vided with means of warmth, and with only 
winter daylight struggling through the narrow 
casement, had no regard for the matter he was 
copying, and little regard for the manner in 
which he was writing. 

Of the ancient classics, Cicero and Aristotle 
were most earnestly read. A valuable para- 
graph is this : 

" The fact that, during the manuscript period and 
the first two centuriess of printing, the writings of Cicero 
were reproduced far more largely than those of any 
other of the Roman writers, is interesting as indicating 
a distinct literary preference on the part of successive 
generations both of producers and of readers. The pre- 
eminence of Aristotle in the lists of the mediseval issues 
of the Greek classics has, I judge, a different signifi- 
cance. Aristotle stood for a school of philosophy, the 
teachings of which, in the main, had been accepted by 
the Church, and the copies of his writings were required 
for the use of students. The continued demand for the 
works of Cicero depended upon no such adventitious 
aid, and can, therefore, fairly be credited to their per- 
ennial value as literature" (p. xii.). 

But as the New Europe opened, and Greece 
and Rome faded into the background, while the 
dogmatic theology of the Church developed, the 
classic writers came to be looked upon askance. 
" What do we want," wrote S. Eligius in the 
eighth century, " with the so-called philosophies 
of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, 
or with the rubbish and nonsense of such shame- 
less poets as Homer, Vergil, and Merander ? " 
Vergil became a name to conjure with. Syl- 
vester II. was looked upon as a necromancer, 
because of his love for classic literature ; while 
the writings of Sallust, Livy, Herodotus, and 



220

[Oct. 16, 



Demosthenes became almost as unknown as the 
realm of Prester John. Honorius wrote in the 
twelfth century : " It grieves me when I con- 
sider in my mind the number of persons who, 
having lost their senses, are not ashamed to 
give their utmost labor to the investigation of 
the abominable figments of the poets and the 
captious arguments of the philosophers which 
are wont inextricably to bind the mind that is 
drawn away from God in the bonds of vices, 
and to be ignorant of the Christian profession 
whereby the soul may come to reign everlast- 
ingly with God. . . . Moreover, how is the 
soul profited by the strife of Hector, or the 
argumentation of Plato, or the poems of Ver- 
gil, or the elegies of Ovid? " And so it was 
for four centuries. The Church confounded the 
truth with its interpretation of truth. But while 
St. Bernard, the arch-advocate of this manner 
of thinking, was living, Abelard was also de- 
claring the right of liberty of thought and lib- 
erty of the spirit. 

After all, the narrowness of thought in this 
time was not unmixed with good. There was 
much that was incorrigible in the Germanic 
stock. Feudalism was the political drill-master 
of Europe. Men needed a rod of iron across 
their backs. So, too, the dogmatism of the 
Church, its bigotry and intolerance, had virtue 
in it. In an age when everything tended to 
divide Europe into a chaos of jarring fragments, 
the Church was one in theory, in government, 
in faith, in language. Its unity had to be pre- 
served at any cost, until young Europe might 
become united enough to stand. When that 
time came, dogmatism and scholasticism and 
dialectics had taught men how to think ; the 
new culture of the Renaissance was to give the 
now trained mind of Europe new matter to 
think about. As truth broadened, the ways of 
looking at things could then safely broaden too. 

The author is occasionally led astray by un- 
familiarity with details of general history. No 
" Roman gentleman in far-off Britain " (p. vii.) 
ever ordered, or could have ordered, a copy of 
" the latest ode of Horace," for the reason that 
Britain did not become a Roman province until 
after the Christian era. Is not Boethius entitled 
to as much credit (p. 35) as Isidore for intro- 
ducing to Europe of the Middle Ages the teach- 
ings of philosophy? On p. 38 the author 
apparently uses the words " rule of the Lom- 
bards " to mean the Lombard Italy of the tenth 
century. On p. 55 we read : " England, con- 
verted by her monks, has special reason to be 
proud of the historians furnished by her abbeys. 



One chronicler, Gildas, has painted with fiery 
touches the miseries of Great [!] Britain after 
the departure of the Romans." Confusion worse 
confounded ! Gildas was a monk of the British 
Church, a Briton dwelling in Britain (not 
" Great " Britain), and was not of England nor 
English. Ingulph of Croyland is a forgery, 
and not, as Mr. Putnam thinks (pp. 56, 132), 
a genuine chronicle. Was it not Henry IV. 
instead of Frederick IV. who was hostile to the 
monks of Hirschau? (p. 82). The reform 
movement began rather with the Council of 
Constance than with that of Basel (p. 85). 
Henghist and Horsa landed in 449, not 451 
(p. 93). This statement is not clear to me : 
" During the long years of invasion and of civil 
war, the literary interests and culture that had 
come to the Saxons had been in great part 
swept away" (p. 98). Is it to be understood 
that the term " civil war " refers to the wars of 
the different petty English kingdoms with one 
another ? And what amount of " literary inter- 
ests and culture " came to the Saxons through 
Rome until the missionaries of Gregory the 
Great ? There is curiously little notice of the 
destruction of monasteries and manuscripts by 
the Danes. " Richard " of Wendover (p. 104) 
is properly Roger of Wendover. And, finally, 
is not this a fancy ? " The school at Tours 
[under Charles the Great] may be considered 
as a precursor of the French Academy of mod- 
ern times " (p. 107). 

It is to be hoped that Mr. Putnam's second 
volume, covering a time so rich in men the 
first printer-publishers of France, Casaubon, 
Caxton, the Kobergers of Nuremberg, Eras- 
mus, Luther as an author, the Elzevirs of the 
Low Countries, and the great Italian galaxy, 
and so splendid in ideas freedom of the press 
and the conception of personal property in lit- 
erature will embrace this large spirit already 
indicated in the history of books and authors. 
Books which are worth anything are not merely 
books, but a part of the body of literature. 
Mr. Putnam's personal experience has doubt- 
less led him to dwell upon the making of books 
rather than upon the makers. There is such a 
thing as sympathy with books apart from the 
authors thereof. It certainly was no intentional 
slight, but simply an illustration of the prin- 
ciple that knowledge even of a particular sub- 
ject is too vast and too subtle to be comprised 
between the covers of one volume. Mr. Put- 
nam's modest hope that " the present volume 
may be accepted by the historian of copyright 
and by the students of the subject as forming

THE ART OF WRITING.* 

It is hard to see just who can use the many 
text -books now being published on rhetoric 
and English composition, for every teacher has 
written one himself (or is writing one), and, if 
only out of self-respect, must use it with his 
classes to the exclusion of the rest. That is, 
every teacher has his peculiar way of looking 
at the subject, his own way of teaching it, that 
makes it impossible for him to approve of any- 
body else's way. We have all of us wandered 
far from Aristotle, but there has arisen no 
John Stuart Mill. There is no name of pre- 
eminent greatness among modern writers on 
rhetoric, no one system of post-Aristotelian 
method that compels attention. Every man 
says whatever is right in his own eyes. 

There was a time, long since, when there 
was a more or less definitely accepted system 
of rhetoric ; but even in such palmy days the 
system was not very systematic. In fact, the 
rhetorician (if the teacher or student of good 
writing will accept that name of hissing and 
reproach), the rhetorician has almost always 
been like that distinguished master of the art 
who aroused complaint because he not only had 
" nothing so finite as a system," but not even 
any principles which were " coherent, inter- 
dependent, subordinate, and derivative." In 
place of a system, the modern student has good 
usagef ; in place of logically developed princi- 
ples, the rhetorician substitutes whatever rules 
of practice his own reading and writing recom- 
mend to him. There is perfect freedom on the 
king's highway, and everyone may ride along on 
his hobby at the gait that seems most pleasant. 

Hence (finally to fetch a compass, and get 
around to our subject), it is not easy to criti- 
cise Professor Arlo Bates's " Talks on Writing 
English," as he rightly says a book should be 
criticised, namely by measuring it with a de- 
fined standard. There is no defined standard, be- 
cause there is no system of rhetoric, or English 
composition (if that be the better name), which 
compels consistency, and no theorist who com-

pels agreement. With a good deal of this book 
I disagree, but not because it differs from any 
accepted standard ; merely because it differs 
from my own idea of how the thing should be 
done. 

It must be remarked, however, that Mr. 
Bates's book does not pretend to be a system- 
atic treatment of rhetoric. It is not a college 
text-book, but a book for more general reading. 
It is not a guide to instruction, but a discussion 
of the subject of good writing. As appears 
from the name, it is not a systematic treatise, 
but a series of " talks," or somewhat informal 
lectures. For writing such a book, Mr. Bates 
has very eminent qualifications : he is at once 
a man of letters and a college professor ; he 
has also been an editor. He is entitled to be 
heard on the ars utens and the ars docens. 
While he has the skill and confidence of the 
artist, he is not unacquainted with academic 
tradition nor with the needs and uses of the 
market-place. What we have here is a prac- 
tical discussion of the art of writing by a writer 
who, while devoted to literature, has had the 
privilege of being led into the temptation to 
become a pedant on the one hand and a man of 
affairs on the other, and has resisted both temp- 
tations. 

His book, therefore, has the advantage of 
teaching by example as well as by precept. It 
is encouraging to learn of a man who can do 
the thing himself. Illogical though it be, one 
does feel as though a teacher ought to be able 
to do the thing he teaches. It is true that a 
man may know what good writing is and how 
it is to be attained, and yet not be able to write 
especially well himself. But one feels safer 
with a man who can ; one feels safer, and 
then, also, one finds it more amusing. This 
book is written in a happy and interesting way, 
so that it is a pleasure to read it. If anything, 
it goes a little too far : there are not a few pas- 
sages that please one until one asks, " What 
has all this to do with the matter in hand ? " 
That is natural in the work of an imaginative 
writer : he does not readily confine himself to 
mere didactics ; his ideas have more than the 
mere facts to them. 

I take it, the book is meant for people adopt- 
ing literature as a profession ; certainly the 
greater part of the book will appeal to such a 
public. There is another book on English com- 
position of something the same character as this 
one, and the publishers tell us that it is amaz- 
ingly successful with college classes. But it is 
hard to think of this book's being used as a 



222 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



text- book ; a good teacher could do excellent 
work with it, of course, as with several dozen 
others. But it does not especially address stu- 
dents ; the four chapters on narration, for 
instance, are written with an eye to short stories 
and novels, and there is slight use in trying to 
teach college men in general to write short 
stories or novels. It seems to be the " young 
aspirant for literary honors " who will get the 
most good from these talks. Such a one I can 
imagine reading the book with intense interest, 
keeping it by him and referring to it often, up- 
braiding it for its rigor and trying hard to real- 
ize its felicities. Mr. Bates says he has tried to 
state those things which would have been most 
helpful to him twenty years ago ; his book will 
be most useful to those who have in mind a 
career in the same direction as the author's. 

It is, perhaps, ungracious to be dissatisfied 
with a book for not being what it never intended 
to be, and yet (to harp again upon an old chord) 
I read modern books on writing English with 
a regret that they do not at least attempt a 
thorough authoritative study of the phenomena 
of the expression of thought in letters. Beyond 
such and such a point, one may say, analysis 
cannot go ; and this is true of your analysis if 
you can make it go no farther. But I have 
great faith in the determined energy of the 
scholar, which is something that this book lacks 
something, indeed, to which it hardly pre- 
tends. Mr. Bates says that a professional is a 
person who has learned how to do a thing, 
while an amateur is one who has not. He is 
certainly a professional writer himself, and he 
shows how another can learn something at least 
of his profession. But there is a good deal of 
difference between learning how to do a thing 
and learning how a thing is done. Let a pro- 
fessional be one who knows how to do a thing ; 
the scholar always wants to know how a thing 
is done. We have already many books that 
teach how to write ; no new one adds very 
much to our ideas. What we want now is 
something that gets to the root of the matter. 

Perhaps it is a dangerous experiment. The 
great delight of good writing lies in its charm ; 
it is, of course, not wise for your enchanter to 
explain just how he manages his wonders. To 
try to snatch off the magic robe is perhaps too 
like destroying the last reserve anywhere else : 
you do it at your peril. And yet, one always 
longs to scale a mountain ; there is surely some- 
thing splendid to be seen from the top.

A FAMOUS FAMILY OF SINGERS.* 

Mr. John W. Hutchinson, the sole survivor 
of the famous " Hutchinson Family " of sing- 
ers and musicians, has told their interesting 
story in two large octavo volumes, with fifty- 
seven illustrations. In 1874, Joshua Hutch- 
inson, an older brother, published a " Brief 
Narrative " of the family ; but this was inade- 
quate, and in response to frequent requests from 
friends in all parts of the country the present 
work appears. The first volume concludes with 
the year 1869, and partly because of the 
period covered, partly because of a certain spon- 
taneity and freshness in the manner of telling 
which are lacking in the second is by all odds 
the more interesting and important. The story 
is too long drawn out, and the almost infinite 
number of details grows tiresome. The little 
homely incidents and anecdotes related in the 
first part are of value as side-lights to the his- 
tory of that early time in New England. We 
are even interested to hear just how the belong- 
ings of the quartet were disposed on their first 
tour, how the violins, without cases, were 
hung up inside the carryall, the bass-viol was 
strapped on top, while the little hair-trunk con- 
taining Abby's simple wardrobe was safely 
stowed away on the rack. But we care less to 
be informed how John spent each day at the 
World's Fair, of the old friends he met, and 
what they said. 

Jesse and Mary Hutchinson, of Milford, New 
Hampshire, were the parents of sixteen chil- 
dren, of whom thirteen grew to maturity. The 
father and mother were both musical, and mel- 
ody was a part of the atmosphere of their home. 
Parker Pillsbury was much impressed by an 
incident that occurred in 1844, while he was a 
guest of the Hutchinsons. After breakfast, 
the father was about to start for his labor in the 
fields, when one of the boys asked him if they 
should not sing him a farewell. The father 
paused, and the dozen sons and daughters, led 
by Jesse, the oldest, sang : 

" Our father, we -wish you well. 

When our Lord calls, we hope you will be mentioned in the 
promised land." 

To this prayer the father responded, in sonor- 
ous and earnest tones : 

" My children, I wish you well. 

When our Lord calls, I trust you will be mentioned in the 
promised land."

son family was on Thanksgiving evening, 1839, 
when the eleven sons and two daughters de- 
lighted the Milford people with a free concert 
in the Baptist Church. A little later, the 
quartet, destined to fame on both sides of the 
Atlantic, started out ; they were Judson, John, 
Asa, and Abby, and were christened by Mr. 
N. P. Rogers " a nest of brothers with a sister 
in it." Abby was then only eleven years old ; 
but she proved a drawing card, her voice being 
rarely musical, and she herself a most charm- 
ing creature. A few years ago, Abby, with her 
husband, Mr. Ludlow Patton, visited Santa Fe, 
New Mexico, where the writer was then living, 
and sang in the hotel parlors. It is no exaggera- 
tion to say that, although nearly sixty, she still 
retained the engaging manner and spiritual 
beauty of her youth, and that her voice had 
lost none of its rich melody. She was a beau- 
tiful and noble woman, always the idol of her 
brothers, and probably the most highly gifted 
of the family. The tender solicitude and love 
of all for this youngest blossom are constantly 
shown in these volumes. She early abandoned 
the concert field, being married in 1849, and 
afterwards appearing in public only at rare 
intervals and on very special occasions. Of her 
appearance in 1845, when she went to Great 
Britain with her brothers, Mr. Frank B. Car- 
penter gave a very interesting account : 

" When the evening came for the opening concert, 
the Hanover Square Rooms were crowded by a gather- 
ing of prominent literary and musical people. Abby, 
modestly attired in white, was radiant with happiness 
and intelligence. It was something new to behold one 
so modest, so artless, commanding the attention of En- 
glish audiences. She won the hearts of all. Her voice 
was full and clear, and her execution faultless. Her 
singing of Tennyson's May Queen ' had a heavenly 
charm. The first part was sung with such exuberance 
of youthful joy and hope as to win the instant uncon- 
trolled applause of the audience. The second part in 
sad and mournful strains carried home the words of this 
pathetic song to every heart. It seemed an angel's voice 
whispering to the dying May Queen peace and resigna- 
tion. It was the passing of a spirit to that heaven where 
the sun of righteousness forever shines. She lifted the 
audience to a state of unparalleled exaltation. The next 
day the press of London rang with the praises of the 
American Singers." 

But the greatest work of the Hutchinsons, 
and that in which they won their chief fame, 
was in the anti-slavery field. They were aboli- 
tionists from the very beginning of their career. 
" The Old Granite State " was the song with 
which they opened their concerts ; but there 
were always such stirring melodies as " The 
Slave's Appeal," Get Off the Track," and 
Whittier's anti-slavery verses. Nathaniel P. 



Eogers, always a warm friend, wrote of their 
appearance at one of the great abolition meet- 
ings in Boston : 

" They made the vast multitude toss and heave and 
clamor like the roaring ocean. Orpheus is said to have 
made the trees dance at his playing. The Hutchinsons 
made the thousands at Faneuil Hall spring to their 
feet simultaneously, 'as if in a dance,' and echo the 
anti-slavery appeal with a cheering that almost moved 
the old Revolutionists from their stations on the wall. 
. . . Phillips had been speaking in his happiest vein. 
It was toward night. The old hall was sombre in the 
gloaming. It was thronged to its vast extremities. 
Phillips closed his speech at the highest pitch of his 
fine genius, and retired from the platform, when the 
four brothers (Jesse, Judson, John, and Asa) rushed to 
his place, and took up the argument where he had left 
it, on the very heights of poetic declamation, and carried 
it heavenwards on one of their boldest flights. Jesse 
had framed a series of stanzas on the spot, while Phillips 
was speaking, embodying the leading arguments, and 
enforcing them, as mere oratory cannot, as music and 
poetry only can, and they poured them forth with amaz- 
ing spirit, in one of the maddening Second Advent 
tunes. The vast multitude sprang to their feet, as one 
man, and at the close of the first strain gave vent to 
their enthusiasm in a thunder of unrestrained cheering. 
Three cheers, and three times three, and ever so many 
more, for they could not count they sent out, full- 
hearted and full-toned, till the old roof rang again. 
And throughout the whole succeeding strains they re- 
peated it, not allowing the singers to complete half the 
stanza before breaking out upon them in incontrollable 
emotion." 

Such was their singing, and such was its 
effect. No wonder they were lionized in the 
North and hated in the South. Their work 
brought them in contact with all the great re- 
formers of that golden period, and many pre- 
cious friendships were formed. They sang in 
all parts of the country, to the soldiers in 
camp, to President Lincoln at the White House, 
to great audiences in all our large cities ; and 
though praised and flattered without stint, they 
remained the same simple, unaffected band of 
Yankee singers, pouring themselves forth in 
music that was as natural as breathing. Jud- 
son's voice was a pure tenor, John's a baritone, 
Asa's a deep bass, while Abby sang contralto. 
The voices blended so perfectly that it was quite 
impossible to distinguish the several parts, and 
such exquisite harmony is seldom attained by 
long years of practice. The wives of Judson 
and Asa and John were all singers, and since 
the war there have been so many different 
tribes of Hutchinsons singing in various parts 
of the country as to prompt a Massachu- 
setts paper to declare, a few years ago : " The 
Hutchinson Family, which has been giving 
concerts since the flood, and about one hundred 
of which have died, is singing away as though

nothing had happened, up in New Hampshire." 
Of the three brothers who sang with Abby, 
perhaps the most interesting was Judson, the 
eleventh child, " dear, impulsive, noble Jud- 
son," as Garrison called him. He had more of 
what is termed genius than any of the others. 
Possessed of rare ventriloqual powers, he was 
able in such songs as " Excelsior " to produce 
wonderful effect. Of a nervous, high-strung 
temperament, he was always inclined to mel- 
ancholy ; yet humor and satire were curiously 
blended in him. He is said to have possessed 
what is commonly known as " second-sight," 
and some strange illustrations of this gift are 
given in the present work. Living through that 
stimulating period of moral awakening of which 
the anti-slavery movement was the strongest 
outbreak, when, as Mr. Higginson says, " it was 
in as bad taste for a poor man to have but one 
hobby in his head as for a rich man to keep 
but one horse in his stable," the Hutchinsons 
were not absorbed in the anti-slavery movement 
to the exclusion of other reforms. They sang 
with equal zest in behalf of peace, temperance, 
and woman's enfranchisement. Judson adopted 
new notions with all the ardor of an enthusi- 
astic nature, going about in socks, because he 
did not believe in wearing any garment that 
necessitated the killing of animals, and being 
a most devoted Grahamite. The rest of the 
family laughed at Judson's idiosyncrasies, but 
he was the one they all loved most. His mind, 
like many another so sensitively attuned, be- 
came really unbalanced during the last years 
of his life, and in a period of depression he 
hanged himself. Each of this band of singers 
is interesting in his way ; they all had strongly 
pronounced personalities, and may be taken as 
types of the New England character of their 
time. All but one have passed over to the 
great unknown ; and it was fitting that this last 
of the sixteen, lingering now " among new men, 
strange faces, other minds," should tell the story 
of the picturesque band who rendered such val- 
iant service to the cause of humanity in the 
days that tried men's souls.

LOCKHART'S Life of Sir Walter Scott," in the con- 
densed form of the edition of 1848, has been published 
in an excellent two-volume American edition (Crowell). 
It will be remembered that this revision and condensa- 
tion of the full biography was made by Lockhart himself, 
who compressed the original eighty-four chapters into 
eighteen, and added considerable fresh matter. Life is 
too short to allow many of us to read the work in its 
earlier form, and this abridgment gives us the best of 
both Scott and Lockhart. 



SOCIAL FORCES ix GERMAN TJITERATURE.* 

Since Herder put forth the doctrine that 
literature is only one of many manifestations of 
national life, a century passed before the writ- 
ers of histories of literature learned to apply to 
their work the natural conclusions of the doc- 
trine, and to keep their readers always in sight 
of the reality behind the manifestation. No 
history of literature is satisfactory to-day unless 
it is more or less a philosophy of literature. 
Of course it is not possible within practicable 
limits to display at every moment the whole of 
the national life together with its literary pro- 
duct. The reader must be familiar already 
with the outlines of the general history. Taine, 
in the Introduction to his " English Litera- 
ture," makes the race, the surroundings, and 
the epoch the essential features which he would 
keep in sight of his readers ; but he hardly 
carries out his programme as to the last of 
these. We see constantly the full-feeding, pug- 
nacious Saxon and his foggy green island, but 
not much of the popular, intellectual, and polit- 
ical life of an epoch. Scherer, in his " Ger- 
man Literature," as in a well-constructed his- 
torical novel, keeps the dynastic history evident 
in the background, but does not hold his read- 
ers well in touch with the great social move- 
ments of the nation. 

In deciding what phases of the nation's life 
to portray along with its literature, it is inev- 
itable that a writer have a theory and follow a 
principle. This Dr. Francke has done in his 
study of " Social Forces in German Litera- 
ture." He endeavors to keep always in mind 
the prime tendencies in the social and intel- 
lectual life of the period, and especially the 
parallel expressions of these tendencies in phi- 
losophy and art. He sees these tendencies 
striving between the poles of individualism and 
collectivism, finding perfection on the indi- 
vidualistic side in the great masters of the 
eighteenth century, and moving even now to- 
ward a collectivistic harmony. If the effort to 
discover these tendencies in all interesting 
works of German literature seems occasionally 
a little forced, on the whole it must be admitted 
by even the most determined casualist that the 
theory is luminous. For the first time, Ger- 
man literature has been depicted with a spirit 
that imparts to it organic unity. We have not, 
then, a mere old-fashioned chronological list of

German authors, with brief biographies and 
extracts, such as might serve for cramming in 
a civil service examination ; and yet few works 
of importance fail to receive mention, while the 
excellent index and bibliographic foot-notes 
make the volume a satisfactory hand-book for 
college classes pursuing the outline of the sub- 
ject. Doubtless Dr. Francke had no thought 
of supplanting Scherer, but he has certainly 
produced an indispensable supplement to that 
or any other standard history of German litera- 
ture. 

Notwithstanding what has just been said of 
the pursuit of a theory, and the disclaimer in 
the Preface of any pretensions to purely liter- 
ary criticism, this book is rich in well-weighed, 
condensed judgments of writers, and in dis- 
criminating, yet enthusiastic, appreciations of 
the best qualities in their masterpieces. For 
instance, in speaking of the Court Epics our 
author says : 

" There is no background to most of these poems. 
In reading them we feel as if we were seeing a mirage. 
. . . However varied and fantastic the armours and 
garments of these lords and ladies are, almost all their 
faces look alike; however wild the forests, however gor- 
geous the ravines, we do not hear the wind rustle in the 
leaves or the water roaring in its fall. And over the 
unending succession of fashionable happenings, of gal- 
lant tournaments, of love-scenes both delicate and frivo- 
lous, of bold abductions and miraculous escapes, we 
entirely lose sight of the real forces and the true mean- 
ing of life." 

Here is a much-needed correction of a cur- 
rent error regarding what are called Popular 
Lyrics and Epics ( Volkslieder, VolTcsepen): 

" No doubt there is a great deal of truth in the asser- 
tion that the Volkslied is property and product of the 
whole nation. . . . And yet it is equally certain that 
each Volkslied, in its original form, is property and 
product of an individual poet, and is the result of indi- 
vidual and personal experiences. If this were not self- 
evident, the German folk-songs of the fourteenth, fif- 
teenth, and sixteenth centuries would give ample proof 
of it." 

As an illustration of Dr. Francke's method, 
I submit several extracts from his treatment of 
Luther and the Reformation. 

" The history of the German people in the sixteenth 
century presents a strange and sad spectacle. At the 
beginning of the period Germany, of all European na- 
tions, shows the highest intellectual promise. . . . 
Great men are standing up for a great cause. Coper- 
nicus is pointing toward an entirely new conception of 
the physical universe. Erasmus and Hutten, Holbein 
and Diirer, Melanchthon and Luther, each in his own 
sphere, are preparing the way for a new and higher 
form of national life. It seems as though a strong and 
free German state, a golden age of German art and lit- 
erature, were near at hand. At the end of the century 
all these hopes are crushed. While England is enter- 



ing the Elizabethan era, while the Dutch are fighting 
the most glorious struggle of modern times for free 
thought and free government, Germany, the mother- 
land of religious liberty, is hopelessly lost in the conflict 
between Jesuit and Protestant fanaticism, and is grad- 
ually drifting toward the abyss of the Thirty Years' 
War." 

Such is the introduction to the chapter the 
statement of the question. After an analysis 
of Humanism and of Luther's greater works, 
Dr. Francke prepares for a resume : 

" We have already spoken of the causes which be- 
tween 1525 and 1530, brought the Reformation move- 
ment to a standstill and checked the upward, idealistic 
current of German literature. To say it once more: 
the chief reason was the absence in the Germany of the 
sixteenth century of a strong national will, of an en- 
lightened public opinion. . . . The result was that the 
religious Reformation, instead of being borne along by 
an irresistible tide of national enthusiasm, was forced 
into the narrow channels of local fanaticism. . . . And 
thus it came about that at the very time (1530) when 
the Augsburg Confession, the official form of the Pro- 
testant belief, was definitely fixed, Protestantism had 
ceased to represent, what in the beginning it had stood 
for, the deepest hopes and highest aspirations of a united 
people." 

" Luther himself ended by abandoning the ideals of 
his early manhood. He had broken with the old sacred 
tradition; he had rejected all outward helps to salva- 
tion; he had placed himself on his own ground, alone in 
all the world, trusting in the personal guidance and pro- 
tection of God. As a result of his own teaching he now 
saw the country transformed into a surging sea, tossed, 
as it seemed to him, by evil doctrines and pernicious 
contests. Had it, then, really been the voice of God 
that called him ? . . . He can only answer these terri- 
ble questionings by a blind and implicit faith. He comes 
forth from the struggle, not as he entered it, strong in 
intellectual fearlessness, but strong in stubborn adher- 
ence to a chosen authority ; not any longer the champion 
of reason, but as its defamer." 

" And yet how different the intellectual history of 
Germany and of the world would have been if the man 
who had given the German people the idea of universal 
priesthood, who had called on them to fling away the 
form in order to save the substance of religion, who had 
grounded the religious life upon individual belief and 
individual reason, had not ended as the founder of a 
new orthodoxy and a new absolutism." 

It is manifest, in the extracts already given, 
that the judgments of the author are not 
mere re- wordings of the opinions of standard 
critics. Every page bears witness to his inde- 
pendence. But it is an independence based evi- 
dently upon broad and careful knowledge, and 
will therefore attract and interest in its concur- 
rence as well as in its dissent. Among dissenting 
positions is what is meant to be a " Rettung " 
of Klopstock. In the opinion that " the time 
will certainly come when even the narrative 
part of the Messias will again, as in Goethe's 
youth, find readers willing to let themselves be

carried along by its powerful and sonorous, 
though sometimes monotonous, flow of oratory," 
Dr. Francke will probably find few sympa- 
thizers, least of all, if we may credit a recent 
report, from one of his colleagues in the En- 
glish department. 

It is not possible within the limits of this 
review to do justice to Dr. Francke's treatment 
of the great writers of the eighteenth century. 
In general, there is here much more of literary 
criticism than in other parts of the book. 
While there is a conscientious, and, as it seems 
to me, thoroughly successful, attempt to do jus- 
tice to Goethe, the author's sympathies are 
plainly with Schiller. He admires Goethe, he 
loves Schiller. For instance, your genuine 
Goethe worshipper would not be satisfied to 
have this said of " Wilhelm Meister ": 

" We feel as though we could not breathe in this 
atmosphere, as though there was no chance for activity 
in a social order in which the main interests of modern 
German life, a national dynasty, a national parliament, 
problems of national organization, defence and self- 
assertion, had no part. We even feel something akin 
to contempt for these men and women who keep a most 
scrupulous account of their own precious emotions, who 
bestow the most serious consideration upon a host of 
insignificant trifles, and who, at the same time, only too 
often are found erring in the simplest questions of right 
and wrong." 

Yet the novel is by no means herewith con- 
demned. With great care its undoubted merits 
and historical significance are pointed out. But 
when Dr. Francke turns to Schiller's charac- 
ters, he says : 

" If they are sometimes lacking in that instinctive 
sympathy with human nature as it is which distinguishes 
all of Shakspere's and nearly all of Goethe's work, they 
compensate for this by their splendid enthusiasm for 
human nature as it ought to be." 

Rarely, as in the case of Richter, there seems 
to be an incomplete reconciliation of the hith- 
erto prevailing opinion, and the author's own, 
and both appear. For instance : 

" In him [Jean Paul], it seemed, the ideal of an har- 
monious, all-embracing individuality had taken bodily 
form and come to walk among men. There probably 
never was a poet who felt more deeply and with more 
personal ardor than Jean Paul the unity of all life. His 
loving eye lingered with the same calm serenity upon 
the smallest and the greatest. His life was filled with 
that profound and joyous awe which springs from a 
strong and abiding sense of the infinite and which is 
man's best part.' " 

But a few pages farther on occur these bewil- 
dering, though certainly just, judgments : 

" How could he help being devoid of the moral 
soundness and vigor which is the fruit of individual tal- 
ent exercised in the service of a common cause ? " 

" His real interest lay, not in the universal and the 



normal, but in the exceptional and the abnormal, in the 
capricious and the diseased." 

" It is indeed well-nigh impossible for the modern 
reader to find his way through the labyrinthine tangle 
of Jean Paul's imagination. These enchanted forests of 
wild adventure and mysterious chance, these dreary des- 
erts of recondite learning, these gloomy caverns of mys- 
tic contemplation, these cataracts of untamed emotion, 
how strange and bewildering it all is ! " 

What a blessed feeling of relief these last par- 
agraphs must bring to many a docile literary 
conscience confused in its vain attempts to 
bring the hitherto required tribute to Richter's 
shrine ! 

But I have said and quoted enough to arouse 
in every friend of German literature the de- 
sire to possess this interesting volume. The 
style is clear, crisp, and unobtrusive, and de- 
spite the modest apology of the Preface, would 
probably betray to no one not on the alert for 
evidence the fact that the author left Germany 
less than fifteen years ago. The proof has been 
read with great care, the few errors being 
mostly immaterial, and the publishers have 
given a handsome and dignified outfitting to 
what is destined to be a standard work for both 
professional and general uses.

of the University of Chicago. Such work as has been 
done in this field by Dr. Lewis, Dr. Carpenter, and

a right to expect from the university thesis, although 
we do not always get it. The University of Chicago 
has set a high standard in this matter, and the lat- 
est English monograph that has issued from this 
institution certainly does not derogate from that 
standard. It is the work of Miss Myra Reynolds, 
and has for its subject " The Treatment of Nature 
in English Poetry between Pope and Wordsworth." 
The author has evidently read, note-book in hand, 
the main body of eighteenth-century poetry, a large 
part of the fiction, and not a little of the literature 
of travel of the period. Her monograph fills 290 
octavo pages, crammed with illustrative facts and 
phrases, and bristling with references as becomes a 
dissertation ; yet graceful in manner and extremely 
readable, wherein it differs from most works of its 
class. She gives us, first, " a general statement of 
the chief characteristics that marked the treatment 
of nature under the dominance of the English clas- 
sical poets," then a detailed study of those poets in 
whose writings we may find germs of the conception

of nature that was to burst into full flower with 
Wordsworth and his contemporaries ; and, finally, 
brief special chapters on the landscape gardening, 
the fiction, the books of travel, and the landscape 
painting of the eighteenth century. The work is 
essentially a study in literary evolution, and contrib- 
utes an important chapter to the new history of our 
literature, the work of many hands, that is slowly 
emerging, and that will, when completed, be as dif- 
ferent from the earlier annalistic treatment as Ly- 
ell's " Geology " was different from the catastrophic 
geology of his predecessors. " Before Wordsworth, 
most of his characteristic thoughts on nature had 
received fairly explicit statement." This sentence, 
taken from the last page of Miss Reynolds's essay, 
is amply justified by the pages that go before, and 
may be taken as striking the keynote of her work. 

A study in ^ " The Authorship of the King'is 

Old Scottish Quair," by J. T. T. Brown, we have 

Literature. what> if pu bli s hed in Germany, would 

be a simple dissertation or programme, a thin pam- 
phlet sold for a mark. As brought out by the Pub- 
lishers to the University of Glasgow, however, it 
appears in a much more imposing and sumptuous 
dress. Internally, there is not so much difference 
of spirit ; the book is an argument to show that the 
old Scotch poem of " The King'is Quair " was not 
written by James I., as has been commonly sup- 
posed. The view has not been universally accepted ; 
indeed, there has been a running fire of criticism and 
correspondence on the subject throughout the past 
summer. We have not space at hand even to sum- 
marize the argument ; and on other terms, an opin- 
ion on the outcome would hardly be of value. The 
case practically rests on six points : first, the poem 
is not by James, because the earliest ascription to 
him is of doubtful value ; because the testimonies to 
his poetical ability are not convincing, while the 
silence of authoritative writers weighs heavily against 
it ; because there is no sufficient reason to suppose 
that James, who was captured by the English when 
only twelve, would or could have written Lowland 
Scotch before he was released, and because of some 
errors as to the facts of the King's life which seem 
to be borrowed from Wyntoun's Chronicle ; second, 
the poem is of a later date than James, because it 
has several characteristics of the Scotch of the lat- 
ter half of the century, and because it is evidently 
written with some reference to " The Court of Love." 
Stated thus baldly, these reasons do not, of course, 
have the weight given by fuller treatment; but 
scholars will be able to see the direction of the ar- 
gument. Our own opinion is that the last two points 
are the only ones of much value : if " The King'is 
Quair " were written after " The Court of Love " 
(about 1450), if the rhymes show that its language 
is of the latter part of the century, it is not probable 
that it was written by James I., who died in 1437. 
But we cannot regard the parallelisms with " The 
Court of Love " as wholly convincing ; and as to the 
showing of the language to be late fifteenth century, 



our author prefers " to leave the task to others bet- 
ter qualified," a modest and laudable proceeding, 
but not convincing or persuasive as an argument. 
The Macmillan Co. are the American publishers. 

It is quite certain that few of us get 
as much as we might out of the 
picture-galleries and museums of our 
large cities ; and particularly is this apt to be the 
case with regard to collections of casts from the 
antique. Most people feel as though " the chisel of 
Phidias " was a something not wholly unfamiliar to 
them, but too often one's ideas upon the art of Phi- 
dias are based merely upon the Psyche and Flying 
Mercury we happen to have in the parlor, and vague 
recollections of the Venus of Melos and the Apollo 
Belvedere. In rendering more popular the knowl- 
edge of Greek sculpture and indicating its possibil- 
ities, we can hardly overrate the value of a book 
like the " Catalogue of the Casts of Greek and 
Roman Sculpture in the Museum of Fine Arts" 
(Boston), prepared by Mr. Edward Robinson, Cur- 
ator of Classical Antiquities, and now in its third 
and revised edition (Houghton). We speak prin- 
cipally of the value of this book, not merely to those 
who walk about the galleries of casts and want to 
know what this or that may be, but to anyone who 
wants to know about Greek sculpture, for the book 
gives a careful discussion of each statue. It has its 
value to scholars also, both in its opinions and its 
indications of literature ; but for popular use the 
book is especially adapted, and such use it will serve 
admirably. Even if the reader be not able to go to 
the Museum and see the casts in question, the book 
will furnish him with a guide to study, or, if no more, 
with much useful information. And, after all, Greek 
sculpture is something that one should have at least 
some little notion of, if only for the part it plays in 
every-day literature or conversation. True, most of 
us can appreciate that strange remark found by 
Longfellow somewhere, " Her arms were as lovely 
as those of the Venus di Milo," but how many see 
why that friend of Emerson's insisted that the 
Rondanini Medusa was really a Mnemosyne?

than might care for the record of older Boston

Bulfinch was a man of broad culture. He came of 
a family well-known in the Boston of the eighteenth 
century, in which was kept up a relation with Eu- 
rope, both by study in earlier years and by later 
travel, that brought their interests more into the cur- 
rent of the world's ideas than was commonly the case 
in the America of a hundred years ago. His grand- 
father and his father had been doctors, one study- 
ing his profession in Paris, the other in London and 
Edinburgh. Although not destined for the family 
profession, Charles Bulfinch spent several years of

his youth in continental study, with results advan- 
tageous not merely to himself but to the country as 
well. Subsequent events rather forced upon him 
as a profession what had been more of a cultivated 
taste, and he became the first American architect of 
real distinction. The nation at large knows his work 
in the west front of the Capitol at Washington and 
in the State House at Boston, while a smaller con- 
stituency owe to him University Hall in Cambridge 
and the Massachusetts General Hospital. In this 
life of a man who, becoming imbued with old-world 
culture, if in one direction only, returned to his own 
country and gave himself up to doing what he could 
to increase her power and breadth of civilization, 
we of a later day have a peculiar interest. We 
should be glad to call especial attention to the many 
agreeable nooks and by-paths, as one may say, in 
the main road ; but these the reader must discover 
for himself. The book is pleasantly written by Miss 
Ellen Bulfinch, with many letters, and is presented 
in delightful form by the publishers. 

The cante-fable of "Aucassin et Nic- 
olete " has become of late years some- 
what widely known to English read- 
ers, thanks mainly to the delightful version made 
by Mr. Andrew Lang. That old French romance 
contains many other gems of purest ray serene, 
hardly inferior in beauty to that tale of Provencal 
love, is a fact by no means so well known. A lit- 
tle volume called " Nouvelles Franchises en Prose 
du Xlllme Siecle," published in 1856, presented 
modern readers with the text of five romances, of 
which " Aucassin et Nicolete " was the last. The 
other four have been left for the late William Mor- 
ris to translate, and his versions have duly appeared 
as issues of the Kelmscott Press. Not long before 
his death, the translator consented to the re-publica- 
tion of these four translations in a volume of the 
ordinary sort, and asked Mr. Joseph Jacobs to intro- 
duce them to their new and wider public. This vol- 
ume of " Old French Romances " (imported by 
Scribner) is a treasure indeed. The English is as 
archaic as one could wish, and the spirit of the 
mediaeval French most subtly decanted into new 
vessels. The events of these stories happen, as the 
editor happily suggests, " at the root of the moun- 
tains, on the glittering plain, and in short, we get 
news from Nowhere." And for this gift, as for so 
many others of perfect beauty, we may now thank 
only the memory of the noble poet whose special 
mission it was to interpret to a self-conscious age 
the life and thought of an unsophisticated past. 

It is encouraging to read so interest- 
ing a book upon a subject usually so 
dry as " Proportional Representa- 
tion "; and Professor J. R. Commons, while in some 
sense an advocate, has done much in his essay upon 
the subject to disabuse the mind of misconceptions, 
and to present a clear, cogent, and impartial con- 



sideration of a greatly misunderstood movement. 
He contends that while proportional representation 
recognizes the existence of parties as indispensable 
in a free government, it prohibits the exaggerated 
influence of small factions holding the balance of 
power between two parties, and thus removes the 
incentives to bribery in elections. He thinks also 
that proportional representation based upon political 
opinions, rather than territorial areas, is a " spe- 
cific " for the gerrymander. By abolishing districts, 
the substance of the gerrymander is effectually oblit- 
erated. Parties are represented in proportion to 
their strength. Justice and equality become reali- 
ties. The independence of the voter, and freedom 
from the rule of the party machine, are assured. 
" Freedom from the rule of the machine," he says, 
" is, first, power on the part of the voters to control 
the nominations of their party ; and second, power 
to defeat obnoxious candidates without endangering 
the success of the party." His arguments are sus- 
tained with tables, maps, and diagrams, illustrating 
and explaining them. Proportional representation 
is not an untried experiment. It has been success- 
fully tried and is at present in vogue in several of 
the cantons of Switzerland, and there is no thought 
of change there. It is now proposed as a method 
of reform in American politics. Professor Com- 
mons believes it is only preliminary to social reform. 
The book is a valuable addition to the " Library of 
Economics and Politics " (Crowell). 



A glance at 

Japanese 

literature. 



One of the distinctive characteristics 
of this century of English letters is 
its relation to the literature of for- 
eign countries. In the beginning of the century, 
Coleridge and Carlyle began to familiarize us with 
German literature. In the middle of the century, 
attention being already centrifugal, Tourgue'nieff 
and Tolstoi concentrated interest upon the literature 
of Russia. Nowadays we can hardly say that there is 
any particular foreign influence ; Norway and Bel- 
gium and Spain attract to themselves, by this touch 
of novelty, an already half- jaded curiosity ; but no 
single nation exerts the power over the republic of 
letters that was exerted by France two hundred 
years ago, or by Germany more recently. It is pos- 
sible that a new interest will arise, not only in En- 
gland but in all cultivated Europe, for the literature 
of Japan. We have already been strongly influenced 
by her more material arts and craft, but we do not 
know much of Japanese literature. With a view of 
affording some acquaintance therewith, Roger Rior- 
dan and Tozo Takayanagi have given us " Sunrise 
Stories " (Scribner) . The book is called " A Glance 
at the Literature of Japan," and that is just about 
what it is. After we have read it we feel that we 
have glanced at the matter, and no more. It is 
neither a serious history of the development of Jap- 
anese literature, nor a free rendering of its spirit. 
We rather regret that the book should neither charm 
and delight us nor give us material for information 



1896.]

which we may desire. It is attractively printed, 
and there is a good deal that is interesting besides ; 
but it still leaves a place for an Introduction to 
Japanese literature that shall be either fascinating 
or scholarly, or both. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Briefs for Debate " (Longmans), edited by Messrs. 
W. Du Bois Brookings and Ralph Curtis Ringwalt, is a 
book that will be found useful by members of literary 
societies, and will also prove a helpful adjunct to the 
work of the teacher of rhetoric. The subjects selected 
deal with " current political, economic, and social topics." 
A great number of such topics are analyzed, and sup- 
plied with outline arguments and bibliographical refer- 
ences. Professor Albert Bushnell Hart provides the 
work with an excellent introduction. 

Madame de La Fayette's " La Princesse de Cleves " 
(Ginn) is edited for school use by Messrs. B. F. Sledd 
and H. Gorrell, and is a welcome addition to our list of 
annotated texts. "Moi," a three-act comedy by La- 
biche and Martin (Allyn), is edited by Mr. B. W. Wells 
for what is styled the "Ca Ira" series. Other books 
for the teacher of French are " Premieres Lectures " 
(Jenkins), by " Veteran"; "French Lessons and Exer- 
cises " (Heath), by Mr. C. H. Grandgent; and a book in 
two parts on " The Study and Practice of French in 
School," by Mile. Louise C. Boname, who is her own 
publisher. 

Professor O. F. Emerson's " Brief History of the En- 
glish Language " (Macmillan) is marked by the same 
excellences as his longer work on the same subject, pub- 
lished less than two years ago; the differences being 
principally in the way of condensation and re-arrange- 
ment in the later work, to adapt it to the use of schools. 
One of the noticeable features of the book is the stress 
laid upon spoken language as a factor in shaping En- 
glish past and present; and this, in the hands of an 
enthusiastic and skilful teacher, may be made the means 
of original work on the part of students. 

Mr. Arthur Waugh's new six- volume edition of "John- 
son's Lives of the Poets " (imported by Scribner), of 
which four volumes have already been issued, presents 
the work in a very satisfactory form. Cunningham's 
edition, hitherto the library standard, has become out- 
dated by the mass of new information that has accum- 
ulated during the past forty years, and his text is by no 
means accurate. Mr. Waugh gives us a new apparatus 
of notes, concisely stated and sparingly introduced, while 
his text is literally " that of the last edition to pass un- 
der Johnson's revision, the edition of 1783; the phras- 
ing, punctuation, and spelling have been alike faithfully 
preserved." The edition is made particularly attractive 
by portraits of all the poets discussed by Johnson. 

The pretty edition of FitzGerald's " Omar," pub- 
lished by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., gives us the 
text of the " Rubaiyat " as posthumously corrected by 
Mr. W. Aldis Wright, also the text of the first edition, 
and the variants offered by the others. It also contains 
a biography by Mr. Michael Kerney, the epilogue to 
Tennyson's " Teiresias," the translator's own introduc- 
tion and notes, and, in addition to all these features, 
reprints the translation of Jami's " Salaman and Absal." 
A portrait also appears, and the book contains, alto- 
gether, a good dollar's worth of literature. 



IjITERARY NOTES. 



It is announced that Mr. J. W. Mackail will write 
the biography of William Morris. 

Balzac's " The Country Parson " (" Le Cur<$ de Vil- 
lage"), translated by Miss Ellen Marriage, has just 
been published by the Macmillan Co. 

Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton is now publishing a vol- 
ume of " Collected Essays." We trust that we may not 
have to wait long for an American edition. 

" Germany " and " The Sea " are the respective sub- 
jects of two new volumes in the series of " Stories by 
English Authors," of which Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons are the publishers. 

The " Athenaeum " states that Mr. Aubrey de Vere is 
about to publish his autobiography, containing reminis- 
cences of the various men of literary eminence with 
whom he has been associated during the last fifty years. 

Four new volumes have been published in the taste- 
ful new edition of Marryatt issued by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. The titles are " Percival Keene," " Mas- 
termau Ready," " The Privateersman," and " Monsieur 
Violet." 

The Minister's Wooing," " The Pearl of Orr's Is- 
land," and " Agnes of Sorrento," are the first volumes, 
just published, of the new uniform edition of Mrs. 
Stowe's writings. Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. are 
the publishers. 

A new series of works to be known as " The Sports- 
man's Library," will be published by Mr. Edward Ar- 
nold, New York. The volumes will be issued at the 
rate of two or three a year, under the editorship of Sir 
Herbert Maxwell, and will be profusely illustrated. 

The series called " Heroes of the Nations," published 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, has hitherto consisted 
entirely of new books. The latest volume offers a de- 
parture from this custom, being nothing more than a 
new edition of Irving's " Columbus " in its shorter form. 

" Bibliographica," the beautiful quarterly publication 
devoted to the history and art of books, has reached its 
tenth issue, leaving but two more to complete the series. 
We feel that we are conferring a favor on book lovers 
and collectors in advising them to send to Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons, the American agents, for pros- 
pectuses of this really monumental work. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have just published, at 
a moderate price, a neat and compact edition of Bour- 
rienne's " Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte." Four vol- 
umes are bound in two, and numerous illustrations are 
supplied. The same publishers also send us an excep- 
tionally attractive edition of Cooper's " Leatherstock- 
ing " novels, in five volumes, handsomely illustrated. 

The second volume of " The Tragedies of Euripides 
in English Verse," translated by Mr. Arthur S. Way, has 
just been published by the Macmillan Co. A third vol- 
ume will complete the work. The instalment now pub- 
lished includes a considerable essay on " Euripides and 
His Work," and translations of the following six plays: 
"Andromache," "The Children of Herakles," "The 
Daughters of Troy," " Electra," " Helen," and " The 
Madness of Herakles." 

The American Library Association is raising a fund 
for the purpose of placing a bronze bust of the late Dr. 
William F. Poole in the Public Library or the New- 
berry Library, Chicago, and the Committee will welcome 
contributions from any one of the multitudes who have 



230 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



found " Poole's Index " of great use to them and would 
like to honor its maker. No one has done more than 
Dr. Poole to promote the cause of general culture 
through public libraries. The committee, of which Dr. 
G. E. Wire, 1574 Judson Ave., Evanston, 111., is secre- 
tary and treasurer, will welcome all contributions, how- 
ever small. 

Wiilker's " Geschichte der Englischen Litteratur " is 
the initial number of an important series of illustrated 
histories of literatures, soon to be published by Das 
Biobliographische Institut in Leipzig. Each history will 
be prepared by men of authority in their own line: the 
one on German literature by Professors Friedrich Vogt 
and Max Koch of Breslau; on the French, by Profes- 
sors Hermann Suchier of Halle and Heinrich Morf of 
Zurich; the Italian, by Lector Berthold Wiese of Halle 
and Privatdocent Erasmo Percopo of Naples. Some- 
what later the series will include histories of the litera- 
tures of the Slavonic and Oriental nations. The pub- 
lishers intend to avoid the publication of " picture- 
books," and will make the illustrations contribute in 
every possible way to the clearer presentation of the 
subject. In selecting material for illustrations, three 
general principles are to be followed : they must not be 
too numerous, they must be selected by specialists and 
be arranged on scientific principles, and they must be 
reproduced from authentic originals and in the very 
best artistic skill. The first Lieferung of the work on 
English literature has just appeared, and gives a fair 
sample of what may be expected from the rest of the 
series. Professor Wiilker's name is ample guarantee 
that the book is trustworthy and fully abreast of the 
latest scientific research, and the illustrations seem to 
have been selected and reproduced according to the 
principles just mentioned. One of these is a facsimile 
of a page from the Anglo-Saxon Durhambuch; another 
is a full-page wood-cut of Tennyson; others are of the 
earliest monuments of civilization in England. With 
them is given exact information as to the history of the 
originals and their present location. In the whole book 
of fourteen lieferungen there will be one hundred and 
fifty illustrations in the text, twenty-five large ones in 
colors or from copper or wood, and eleven facsimile 
inserts; and among them all will be a large number of 
authentic portraits. The treatment of Ossian is quite 
characteristic, and shows the general method of the 
book. After briefly describing Ossian and the Sagen- 
kreis upon which his poems are based, the discussion 
shows how Macpherson in the eighteenth century won 
renown by sending these poems all over the world to 
influence more or less the literatures of other peoples. 
Then follows an abstract of many of the poems, with 
frequent quotations in modern German translation. The 
complete book is to be sold at fourteen marks. 



ON RETURNING A BORROWED BOOK. 

" Such is the fate of borrowed Books ; they 're lost, 
Or not the Book returneth, but its Ghost." 

Charles Nodier. 

This book you loaned, I did not borrow; 

Else had you wisdom at great cost, 
And learned the truth made Nodier sorrow: 

A borrowed book returns a ghost. 

I've read the tale of these two lovers; 

My memory 's stolen all 't will hold, 
And yet you 11 find between the covers 

The same sweet story as of old.

By Professor N. S. SHALER. 

As the official head of the "Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard, the first institution

Commission, and as the author of various articles on the subject of roads and road- 
making, Professor Shaler is admirably equipped to write such a book as this. 

A book which sets forth the gospel of good roads with a clearness and force that distinguish everything that 
Professor Shaler has written, one that will prove invaluable in directing into effective channels the rising 
tide of interest in the condition of our highways. Every bicycler should appreciate Professor Shaler's advo- 
cacy of the cause he has at heart. It is just the book to buy and present to the people in charge of roads in 
the improvement of which a wheelman is interested, as it is full of practical suggestions for the building of 
both city and country roads. 12mo, about 300 pages, $1.50.

HOUGHTON, MlFFLIN AND COMPANY'S 
IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS. 

JOHN FISKE. 

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. Illustrated Edition. Containing 22 photogravures of portraits 

and paintings, 15 colored maps and plates, and 280 text-cuts and maps. 2 vols. 8vo, $8.00. 

Large-paper Edition, limited to 250 copies. 2 vols. Large 8vo, $16.00 net. 

To supplement Mr. Fiske's admirable descriptions, and give completeness to his masterly account of the causes 
and course of the American Revolution, these volumes have been profusely illustrated with superb portraits, maps, 
plans of battles, pictures of historic buildings and scenes, medals, facsimiles of important documents, etc., which 
form a very important addition to the value and interest of the work. The object has been not to embellish the 
volumes with pictures, but to reproduce in the various art features whatever would illustrate and emphasize 
the historic characteristics of the epoch. 

The Large-paper Edition presents the work in all the perfection of the most artistic book-making. It is printed 
on English hand-made paper, and is admirably adapted to extension. 

ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS. 

CHAPTERS FROM A LIFE. With 24 portraits and other illustrations. A very handsome book. 

12mo, gilt top, $1.50. 

This is a remarkably attractive book of biographical and literary interest. Miss Phelps tells of her girlhood 
in the beautiful town of Andover, her entrance into the world of authorship, and peculiarly interesting chapters 
give glimpses or full views of Longfellow, Holmes, Whittier, Mr. Fields, Bishop Brooks, Mrs. Stowe, Mrs. Thaxter, 
Miss Larcom, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, and others. 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

CAPE COD. Holiday Edition. Illustrated in water colors by Misa AMELIA M. WATSON. 2 vols. 

Crown 8vo, $5.00. 

Thoreau's unequalled description of Cape Cod, which is one of his most interesting books, is supplemented 
by a hundred admirable illustrations printed in colors on the margins. The two volumes are every way beautiful, 
and cannot fail to be in great demand as holiday gifts. 

SARAH ORNE JEWETT. 

THE COUNTRY OF THE POINTED FIRS. By SARAH ORNE JEWETT, author of The Life of 

Nancy," " Deephaven," "A White Heron," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

This book, portions of which have appeared in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY, shows Miss Jewett at her best. It 
reveals in a delightful way those characteristics of her writings which make them equally attractive and satisfying 
to her circle of readers. It is a charming story of a summer on the coast of Maine and the adjacent islands, and 
is certain to give high pleasure to whoever reads it. 

KATE DOUGLAS WIQQIN. 

MARM LISA. By KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN, author of " The Birds' Christmas Carol," " The Story of 

Patsy," " The Village Watch-Tower," etc. 16mo, $1.00. 

Little Marm Lisa is a fresh child-figure in fiction, but much more than a child-figure. The story is of the 
quickening of her clouded and burdened life till her pathetic faithfulness ripens, in the climax, into heroism. 
Mrs. Wiggin has shown the same remarkable insight into child-life and the same command over the reader's 
emotions that have made " The Birds' Christmas Carol " and " The Story of Patsy " the most popular books of 
their class by any living American writer. 

FLORENCE A. MERRIAM. 

A-BIRDINQ ON A BRONCO. By FLORENCE A. MERRIAM, author of "Birds through an Opera 
Glass " and " My Summer in a Mormon Village." With numerous illustrations. 16mo, $1.25. 
In this book Miss Merriam, who is one of the most loyal of bird-lovers and one of the most accurate of 
observers, writes entertainingly of birds and their nests in Southern California. She treats a field not traversed 
before by one so competent as she to observe and describe it; and lovers of Nature, especially lovers of birds, 
will find the little book full of charm, even though some of the birds described and pictured are more or less 
unfamiliar.

"It is in method, plan, and execution the concordance to

" Every public library in the kingdom, even if it be a small

" Mr. BARTLETT may congratulate himself on having done 
once for all something that will last as long as men use such 
an aid to Shakespeare." 

From the REVIEW OF REVIEWS (New York). 
"Hereafter no library of general reference, and the book- 
shelves of no Shakesperian student, will be complete without 
Mr. BABTLETT'S great work. It will supersede all previous 
productions in its particular field and there have been not 
a few of great excellence and must remain unrivalled for an 
incalculable time."

THE 

History of Modern Painting. 

By RICHARD MUTHER, 

Keeper of the Royal Collection of Prints and Engravings 

at Munich,. 
Imperial 8vo. 2304 pages. With over thirteen 

hundred Illustrations. 
In three Vols. Price per set, cloth, $20.00. 

It would be difficult, if not impossible, to convey in a few 
sentences an adequate impression of the richness of the data 
brought together in these two thousand pages. No such com- 
plete history of Modern Art has ever before been attempted. 

The story opens with the English Art of the eighteenth 
century, and treats at length of the English painters and illus- 
trators of the nineteenth century, of the schools prior to 1840, 
of the artists in water-color, of the plein-air school of Con- 
stable, and of the realists, omitting neither the New Pre- 
Kaphaelites, Burne-Jones, Morris, Walter Crane and Watts, 
nor James M'Neill Whistler, and "The Boys of Glasgow." 
France receives a large share of the author's space ; and from 
France we are led to America and American painters living 
abroad ; to Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Italy, Nor- 
way, Sweden, and Spain ; whilst the influence of Japan on the 
development of European art is not overlooked. 

Yet, however fascinating the letterpress of such a work may 
be, a history of painting without illustrations would fail to 
convey a sufficient conception of the subject. In Dr. Muther's 
work there is an average of two illustrations comprising por- 
traits of many of the artists, and reproductions of their most 
important pictures or drawings to three pages of the text. 
Thus the HISTORY OF MODERN PAINTING appeals to all lovers 
of art who possess pictures or would fain possess them, to all 
who crowd exhibitions and picture galleries, and indeed to 
everyone who is interested in art and history.

D. APPLETON & Co.'s NEW BOOKS. 



RUDYARD KIPLING'S NEW BOOK. 

THE SEVEN SEAS. 

A new volume of poems by RUDYARD KIPLING, author of 
"Many Inventions," " Barrack-Room Ballads," etc. 12mo, 
cloth, special binding, $1.50. 

Mr. Kipling's new volume is one of special importance, in 
that it represents in an admirable and conclusive manner not 
only the verse of the soldier's life, but also the poetry of pa- 
triotism, of adventure, and of the sea, and of a modern field, 
to be termed roughly the romance of applied science, which the 
author has made his own. In this new book the qualities 
which have distinguished Mr. Kipling's best expression in 
verse are shown in a riper and fuller development than before, 
and for this reason, and also on account of his range of themes, 
it seems proper to invite special attention to "The Seven Seas." 

THE STORY OF THE MINE. 

Illustrated by the Great Comstock Lode of Nevada. By 
CHARLES HOWARD SHINN. A new volume in The Story of 
the West Series, edited by RIPLEY HITCHCOCK. Illustrated. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The figures of the prospector and the miner are clearly out- 
lined in the course of the romantic story of that natural treas- 
ure house which more than any other embodies the romance, 
the vicissitudes, the triumphs, the excitement, and the science 
of mining life the Great Comstock Lode. From the pros- 
pector, through development and deep-mining, to the last of 
the stock gambling, the story is told in a way that presents a 
singularly vivid and engrossing picture of a life which has 
played so large a part in the development of the remoter West. 

PIONEERS OF SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 

Sketches of their Lives and Scientific Work. Edited and 
revised by WILLIAM J. YOUMANS, M.D. With Portraits. 
8vo, cloth, $4.00. 

Impelled solely by an enthusiastic love of Nature, and 
neither asking nor receiving outside aid, these early workers 
opened the way and initiated the movement through which 
American science has reached its present commanding posi- 
tion. This book gives some account of these men, their early 
struggles, their scientific labors, and, wherever possible, some- 
thing of their personal characteristics. This information, 
often very difficult to obtain, has been collected from a great 
variety of sources, with the utmost care to secure accuracy. 
It is presented in a series of sketches, some fifty in all, each, 
with a single exception, accompanied with a well-authenticated 
portrait. 

THE EVOLUTION OF THE ART OF MUSIC.

THE RISE AND GROWTH OF THE 
ENGLISH NATION. 

With Special Reference to Epochs and Crises. A History of 
and for the People. By W. H. S. Aubrey, LL.D. In three 
volumes. 12mo, cloth, $4.50. 

This work is written in no partisan or sectarian spirit, and 
is not designed to advocate any particular theory of politics, 
of philosophy, or of religion ; but it claims to be thoroughly 
patriotic and is inspired by a love of the freedom that springs 
out of righteousness and justice. An attempt is made to ex- 
hibit the development of the English people, with the varying 
phases of their daily life, the formation of the national char- 
acter, the continuity and application of great principles, and 
the growth of constitutional liberties. 

STEPHEN CRANE'S NEW BOOK. 

THE LITTLE REGIMENT, 

And Other Episodes of the American Civil War. By STEPHEN 
CRANE. 12mo, cloth, uniform with "The Red Badge of 
Courage," $1.00. 

In these studies of the theme which he treated with such 
power in "The Red Badge of Courage," Mr. Crane shows a 
gain in power and command of his material which indicates 
for the companion volume of " The Red Badge " an equal if 
not a greater success. The book completes the story of " The 
Red Badge's " hero.

DRIVING FOR PLEASURE; 

Or, The Harness Stable and its Appointments. By FRANCIS 
T. UNDERBILL. With 125 Illustrations. Small 4to, bound 
in glazed kid with suede sides, $7.50.

subject of proper appointments, etc., and it will take rank both as the 
recognized authority and also as one of the most elaborately illustrated 
and beautiful of the books dealing in any way with the horse.

THE WORLD'S MEMORY. 

" The world's memory must be kept alive, or 
we shall never see an end of its old mistakes. 
We are in danger to lose our identity and be- 
come infantile in every generation. That is 
the real menace under which we cower every- 
where in this age of change." These words, 
pregnant with vital meaning, and deep in their 
import to our civilization, were spoken the other 
day at Princeton by Professor Woodrow Wil- 
son, the orator of the Sesquicentennial Cele- 
bration. Nor were they an incidental feature 
of the eloquent and masterly oration in which 
they occurred ; they were rather of its very 
texture, and embodied the quintessence of its 
thought. Political philosophers who have 
espoused the cause of modern democracy, and 
who have, with alternating hopes and fears, 
watched its triumphant onward march, who 
have thrilled with its beginnings among sturdy 
Helvetians and determined Netherlanders, who 
have studied it as a peaceful development in 
England and as a volcanic outburst in France, 
who have seen it wrest constitution after con- 
stitution from European monarchs, and who 
have witnessed its subjugation of the great 
New World, have always been insistent upon 
its dangers, and particularly upon the danger 
of its tendency, everywhere manifest, to disre- 
gard the teachings of history, and to reject the 
experience of the past merely because it is 
the past as a guide to the future. It was, 
then, peculiarly fitting that a note of warning 
upon this subject should have been made the 
keynote of Professor Wilson's address, pre- 
pared, as that address was, to commemorate the 
sesquicentennial anniversary of a famous insti- 
tution of learning, and to emphasize the func- 
tion to be performed for our civilization by all 
such institutions, if they are to prove them- 
selves worthy of their trust. 

No society can safely break with the past 
save by a gradual process that is content to sift 
the teachings of experience, and reject only 
what has proved itself prejudicial to human 
progress. Those who do not sympathize with 
the past, and would have us once for all freed 
from its trammels, are precisely those who do 
not understand the past, and are persuaded 
that the essentials of social organization, like 



242

its trappings, are matters of fashion, varying 
from age to age. But the student of history 
who has seen beneath externals, and who has 
caught anything of the spirit of the human 
epic, knows that it is foolish to judge institu- 
tions and beliefs and social ideals by absolute 
standards, knows that all these things are pro- 
ducts of an evolutionary process whereby every 
people in every century has been fitted with 
what it has most needed in its own particular 
stage of culture. That for our own uses we 
reject such devices as monarchy and Moham- 
medanism and the mediaeval guilds, does not 
justify us in assuming that they have worked 
harm in their own time and place. Rather do 
we see in the fact of their existence and long- 
continued potency their ample justification. 
And if we find our own national inheritance to 
include certain elements that to the clear- 
sighted among us seem irrational, impeding the 
steps of progress, we should take long and 
prayerful counsel before seeking to sweep them 
away, restraining our impatience by the reflec- 
tion that whatever is deeply-rooted in the expe- 
rience of past generations must have subserved 
some useful purpose, and that the possibilities 
of its usefulness may not yet be exhausted. 

The universities clearly have no task more 
important than that of drawing our attention to 
the past, and of encouraging us in a sympathetic 
understanding and comprehension of the past. 
Professor Wilson stated one of the deepest of 
truths when he spoke in the following language: 

" Unschooled men have only their habits to remind 
them of the past, only their desires and their instinctive 
judgments of what is to guide them into the future; the 
college should serve the state as its organ of recollec- 
tion, its seat of vital memory. It should give the coun- 
try men who know the probabilities of failure and 
success, who can separate the tendencies which are per- 
manent from the tendencies which are of the moment 
merely, who can distinguish promises from threats, 
knowing the life men have lived, the hopes they have 
tested, and the principles they have proved." 

In the same spirit of wise patriotism, the Presi- 
dent of the United States, on the following day, 
added the testimony of the statesman to that 
of the scholar. 

" In a nation like ours, charged with the care of nu- 
merous and widely varied interests, a spirit of conserv- 
atism and toleration is absolutely essential. A collegiate 
training, the study of principles unvexed by distracting 
and misleading influences, and a correct apprehension 
of the theories upon which our republic is established, 
ought to constitute the college graduate a constant mon- 
itor, warning against popular rashness and excess." 

How greatly we need as a nation to take to 
heart such doctrine is this, is only too clearly 
proved by the political record of the past 



quarter-century. " Popular rashness and ex- 
cess " have been visible everywhere in the coun- 
sels of our leaders and the acts of our public 
officers. In our legislation upon some of the 
most important subjects of public concern we 
have run the whole gamut of folly, delusion, 
and fatuous ignorance of the operations of nat- 
ural law. We have set at defiance the best- 
established principles of political and economic 
thought, and have learned our lesson so ill that 
no sooner have we recovered in part from one 
disaster than we have rushed blindly upon an- 
other. Instead of keeping alive the world's 
memory, we do not succeed in keeping alive 
our memory as individuals. The shallowness 
and ignorance, if not the criminal culpability, 
of some political leader may be to-day so ex- 
posed as to put him clearly to shame in the 
eyes of the world ; yet five years later we may 
find him again a man of position and influence, 
trusted by those whom he has betrayed, his sup- 
port sought after by thousands who have either 
forgotten his past, or are guileless enough to 
believe that the leopard can change his spots. 
If we are to look anywhere for the healing of 
our diseased memory, whether individual or 
national, it must surely be to those institutions 
in which the truth, undimmed by prejudice or 
passion, the truth of yesterday as well as 
of to-day, is sought after by earnest stu- 
dents, under the guidance of men who have 
devoted their lives to seeking out the causes of 
things. 

Such a home for seekers after truth, such an 
altar for keeping " the world's memory " aglow, 
is pictured in the closing passage of Professor 
Wilson's oration, a passage so noble and so 
beautiful that it must not suffer the violence of 
dismemberment. 

" I have had sight of the perfect place of learning in 
my thought; a free place, and a various, where no man 
could be and not know with how great a destiny knowl- 
edge had come into the world itself a little world; but 
not perplexed, living with a singleness of aim not known 
without; the home of sagacious men, hard-headed, and 
with a will to know, debaters of the world's questions 
every day and used to the rough ways of democracy; 
and yet a place removed calm Science seated there, 
recluse, ascetic, like a nun, not knowing that the world 
passes, not caring if the truth but come in answer to 
her prayer; and Literature, walking within her open 
doors in quiet chambers with men of olden time, storied 
walls about her and calm voices infinitely sweet; here 
' magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas 
in fairy lands forlorn,' to which you may withdraw and 
use your youth for pleasure ; there windows open straight 
upon the street where many stand and talk intent upon 
the world of men and business. A place where ideals 
are kept in heart in an air they can breathe, but no fools' 
paradise. A place where to hear the truth about the

past and hold debate upon the affairs of the present, 
with knowledge and without passion; like the world in 
having all men's life at heart, a place for men and all 
that concerns them; but unlike the world in its self- 
possession, its thorough way of talk, its care to know 
more than the moment brings to light ; slow to take ex- 
citement, its air pure and wholesome with a breath of 
faith; every eye within it bright in the clear day and 
quick to look towards heaven for the confirmation of 
its hope." 

We may fitly supplement this passage, and at 
the same time bring these observations to a 
close, by an extract from Dr. Henry Van Dyke's 
Princeton ode, an effort no less worthy of the 
occasion than was Professor Wilson's address : 

" God made the light, and all the light is good. 
There is no war between the old and new ; 
The conflict lies between the false and true. 
The stars, that high in heaven their courses run, 
In glory differ, but their light is one. 
The beacons, gleaming o'er the sea of life, 
Are rivals but in radiance, not in strife." 



IS THERE AN AMERICAN 
LITERATURE? 

At the present time there is in our public schools 
and colleges an unmistakable movement toward the 
systematic study of the American writers. This 
movement is not confined, however, to the schools. 
With the passing of that most remarkable group of 
writers of whom Irving, Bryant, Emerson, Haw- 
thorne, Longfellow, Whittier, Holmes, and Motley 
were the central figures, there has come an unpre- 
cedented interest in the lives and works of these 
men. No one can have failed to notice how numer- 
ous of late have become the works dealing with 
these authors and their writings. Biographies of 
American men of letters have been, during the past 
decade, among the most successful of American 
books. Since 1878, when Professor Richardson 
published his " Primer of American Literature," no 
less than twenty volumes, some of them by such 
eminent and scholarly critics as Underwood, Sted- 
man, Tyler, and Beers, have dealt with the history 
of our prose and verse. The text-book dealing 
exclusively with American literary development has 
but recently appeared, and although it is one of the 
very latest novelties among educational apparatus, 
it has found a permanent and important place in 
the schools. A short appendix to the English Lit- 
erature no longer satisfies our teachers, and the 
demand for a separate book has become so fully 
recognized that within the past year no less than 
seven text-books on this subject have been either 
published or announced by leading houses. The 
movement has spread even into the primary and 
intermediate school grades, where the old readers 
have been replaced almost wholly by entire Amer- 
ican classics published for the purpose in conven- 
iently handled and inexpensive editions. All this 



points to the fact that in the opinion of very many 
thoughtful men the time has come to study Amer- 
ican literature, apart from the English product, as 
if it were a distinct entity. 

This increasing interest in native writings has 
again brought into prominence an old question, one 
that has been discussed at intervals ever since 
Channing opened the debate in 1823 : Have we an 
independent American Literature? Every volume 
thus far published upon our native literary products, 
including works by such authorities as Whipple, 
Underwood, Stedman, Tyler, Richardson, Julian 
Hawthorne, Brander Matthews, and Eugene Law- 
rence, and even foreign critics like Professor Nichol 
of England, Professor Scherr of Germany, and 
others, has borne the title " American Literature," 
and has dealt upon the evolution of the literature, 
its feeble beginnings, its infancy and youth, its first 
traces of individuality, its gradual attainment of 
strength and its full maturity, thus in a way ac- 
knowledging it as a distinct growth. 

It was as a protest against one of the more recent 
of these books that the Professor of English Litera- 
ture in one of our leading universities remarked not 
long since, " I wish we might find some writer and 
publisher with the courage to entitle such a book 
' A History of English Literature in America,' 
the only expression for the thing which is not abso- 
lutely false and misleading." A leading American 
review but yesterday, speaking of " what is called 
American literature," gave forth this dictum : 

" Properly speaking there is no such thing, unless the 
pictorial scratchings of aborigines on stones and birch 
bark are to be classed as literary productions. Every 
piece of literary work done in the English language by 
a man or woman born to the use of it is a part of that 
noble whole which we call English literature, whether 
the author lives in Great Britain, the United States of 
America, the Dominion of Canada, Australia, New Zea- 
land, or South Africa. . . . Just so long as writers in 
the United States continue to express themselves in the 
language of Tennyson and Wordsworth, so long will 
their works belong to the same magnificent literature." 

It cannot but be admitted that these champions 
of " English literature in America " have some very 
good grounds upon which to base their arguments. 
The history of literary Europe does not furnish a 
single precedent against them. In every case the 
language in which a literary production is written 
determines at once its place. An ode in the Greek 
language is now regarded as a part of Greek litera- 
ture, whether written by an Athenian beneath the 
Acropolis or by an alien in Syracuse or Alexandria. 
Roman literature, excepting perhaps such works as 
Bacon's " Novum Organum," comprises all writings 
in Latin, whether they were made by the Tiber, the 
Thames, or the Euphrates. Two thousand years 
from now will not all writings in the English lan- 
guage be regarded as English literature, no matter 
what the geographical place of their production? 
Again, it must be remembered that a perfect litera- 
ture is an evolution. Beginning with the rude war-

songs of a savage tribe, its growth is constantly up- 
wards through every stage of that people's progress 
toward civilization, until at length it reaches its 
flower of perfection. It stands complete as the his- 
tory of a nation's intellectual and spiritual life. It 
has been affected by a thousand elements, race 
peculiarities, physical and spiritual environments, 
contact with neighboring tribes, great moral and 
civil crises, peculiar personalities. It is the essence 
of ten thousand lives ; it is the nation itself far more 
than are the few thousands of breathing beings who 
make up its census. In the light of these argu- 
ments, then, how can there be an independent lit- 
erature in America, a region settled by highly cul- 
tured Englishmen less than three centuries ago, a 
region using the English language in its purity and 
having institutions which fundamentally are true to 
those of the mother land ? 

There is no one, I think, who will not admit that 
the case of two independent literatures written in 
the same language is a wholly unprecedented one ; 
but it is no argument that because a thing is unpre- 
cedented it is therefore impossible. The discovery 
of America was an unprecedented event. It was a 
most marvellous and world-revolutionizing event. 
There are men, even among those whose ancestors 
for generations have been natives of the new soil, 
who have not ceased to wonder about it, who insist 
upon measuring it only by old world standards, on 
treating it as if it were merely a vast addition to the 
area of Europe. America in the first centuries after 
its discovery was almost literally a new world. Man 
never went to live in an environment more strange 
to him. Every element save that of race tended to 
separate the minds of the settlers from those of their 
kindred in the motherland. There was something 
in the air of the new continent, in its vastness and 
freedom, in its unlimited wealth and unprecedented 
opportunities, that tended to put a new spirit into 
its sons, to breed a new race with a new outlook 
and new ideals. Three hundred years of this environ- 
ment have produced a peculiar people, with a dis- 
tinct and strongly marked individuality, living under 
an unprecedented form of government. 

The element of epoch has had its share in the 
problem. The past century has been an unprece- 
dented one, and nowhere more so than in America. 
It has been a century of quick growths, of broad 
and enduring foundations laid with unheard-of 
rapidity. It would have been madness a century 
ago to have prophesied even a fraction of the won- 
ders which were to take place on our soil. The 
history of the development of Western America 
reads like a page from "The Arabian Nights." 
What an era of bustle and stir ! Where else in all 
history can you find similar conditions ? When have 
men been thrown more fully upon their own re- 
sources? The Revolution, that furnace that tried 
the metal of our character to its utmost limit, was 
our heroic period. The mad struggle in the forests 
of a new world was at length over ; the colonists 
found themselves face to face with a bewildering 



and undreamed-of situation. Then came the recon- 
struction period, which called for almost superhuman 
wisdom. The early years of the new government, 
with their test cases, their doubt and uncertainty ; 
the opening of the vast areas beyond the Alle- 
ghanies, with their almost interminable forests and 
prairies, with their swarming fauna and strange 
flora. The new Colonial era that turned as if by 
magic these wilds into a garden the granary of 
the world ; the great wave of foreign immigration 
that poured upon us with increasing force ; the 
thousands of unforeseen problems attendant upon 
rapidly expanding territory and growing popula- 
tion ; the gold fever of '49, with its headlong exo- 
dus over the plains and across the Rockies ; the 
world-revolutionizing inventions of the cotton gin 
and the steamboat ; the rapid spread of railways ; 
the conflict with slavery, which at length burst into 
one of the most disastrous civil wars of modern 
times, all this was crowded into one century. They 
were unprecedented conditions, and they have left 
deep marks in our national character. We have 
been called upon to solve physical and mental and 
moral problems on a vast scale ; we have started 
movements that have become world-wide ; we have 
developed an American spirit that makes us vastly 
different from any other people. This spirit has 
been as distinctly an evolution as has been the En- 
glish spirit. It has grown with great rapidity, but 
the growth has been a natural and a healthy one. 
It has passed through every stage of development. 
Has not Chicago, for example, passed through every 
stage of a city's life, and has it not to-day as dis- 
tinct a personality and as substantial a promise for 
the future as has Paris or London? Yet Chicago 
sixty years ago was a marsh on the remote frontier. 
Americans are recognized at sight the world over. 
To speak of a Yankee as an Englishman in America 
would be to invite ridicule. He is redolent of the 
American soil ; Americanism the spirit of the new 
world breathes from every pore. Let him in the 
person of a Whittier write a " Snow Bound," or in 
the person of a Lowell write " The Biglow Papers," 
can these in fairness be called British literature ? 

That the American literature is written in the 
English language is, in the minds of many, an insu- 
perable argument against its independence. But 
this in reality is the least of all the arguments. Lit- 
erature springs from the soul ; it is the embodiment 
of hopes and fears, of moods gay or melancholy, of 
experience, of sensation, of conjecture, and the lan- 
guage is only the lifeless medium of communication. 
Do Homer into any language, and he is still Greek. 
No translation can take the French out of Hugo or 
the Russian out of Tolstoi. It has been safe to 
define a literature as all the writings in a given lan- 
guage. So firmly fixed is this idea that a recent 
critic of Roger Bacon, who wrote in the thirteenth 
century, declares that "his writings, being all in 
Latin, do not belong to English literature." To 
what literature, then, do they belong? This habit 
of classifying literature according to the medium 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



245 



through which it has passed has come from the fact 
that in the history of the old world there have heen 
no two nations with distinct governments and per- 
sonalities using the same language. It remained 
for the new world to break this precedent. 

There was a time when a few tribes from the 
shores of the North Sea could cross a narrow chan- 
nel to a small island and there become a distinct 
nation. There was no radical change of environ- 
ment ; they did not change their fundamental views 
of life and their great fundamental institutions. 
But this change of habitat took place during 
a barbaric age, one that repelled friendly contact 
with neighbors. They drifted, like all provincial 
peoples, away from their original tongue, until it in 
time became a dialect and finally a language. The 
settlers of America did not cross a mere channel, 
but a then almost inconceivable expanse of ocean ; 
and had the schism taken place in earlier times, 
their language, even after three centuries, would 
have become a dialect almost unintelligible in its 
native land. But the civilization of the present day, 
with its thousand points of contact and its constant 
interchange of books and ideas, does not allow pro- 
vincial growths. The confusion of tongues is a phe- 
nomenon of barbarous ages. There will be few 
new languages in the future. The civilization of 
the past three centuries has been drawing the na- 
tions together, making them into a vast neighbor- 
hood, until even the idea of a universal language 
has been gravely discussed. It was impossible for 
the Americans to grow into a new language, even 
though they changed their form of government, 
their spirit, their outlook on life ; it was equally 
impossible for the Saxons, even though they changed 
but little their environment and institutions, to avoid 
the growth of a new tongue. 

Can we never achieve our literary independence ? 
Must we go down through the ages forever tied intel- 
lectually to the apron-strings of our mother? The 
idea is absurd. It is certain, unless civilization be 
obscured by other Dark Ages, that we shall never 
drift away from England in our language, but we 
are constantly drifting from her in everything else. 
We are doing our own thinking, solving our own 
problems in our own way, and we have been doing 
so for a century. It was in 1820 that Sidney Smith 
demanded of a British public, "Who reads an 
American book?" In the mean time we have pro- 
duced an Emerson, a Foe, a Cooper, a Hawthorne, 
a Whittier, a Lowell, a Whitman, there is no end 
to the list. The writings of these men have been 
no feeble imitation of European models. They have 
been strong and intensely original ; they have over- 
flowed with the spirit of a new world ; they have 
been colored by its soil and permeated with Amer- 
icanism, until to attempt to remove this native ele- 
ment would be to destroy the fabric. Men like 
Cooper and Whitman and Mark Twain would have 
been impossible on any other soil. 

Then for more than a century we have been mak- 
ing our national songs. There are hundreds of lyrics 



that have burst hot from the American heart, and 
that profoundly thrill every American, which yet 
mean nothing to an Englishman save as he trans- 
lates into them his own emotions of fatherland. Are 
these hymns not our own? Is it not foolishness to 
speak of such songs as the " Concord Hymn," " The 
Star Spangled Banner," "My Country 'tis of Thee," 
and " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " as En- 
glish songs in America? Did we not evolve them 
from as profound and tragic an experience as did 
England her " Rule Britannia " ? 

It seems to me that it may be laid down almost 
as an axiom that when a distinct nation has acquired 
a distinct personality and has produced writers and 
writings sui generis, reflecting the soil, the spirit, 
the individuality of that people, then that nation 
has a distinct literature, no matter what may be the 
language in which it is written. American literature 
is proud of its origin. It passed its infancy and 
childhood in the land of Chaucer. The first chap- 
ters of its life-history are the same as those in the 
history of English literature. But in its early man- 
hood it migrated to a new world. Its character was 
evolved during centuries amid unprecedented sur- 
roundings. It stands to-day united to England by 
only one of the four great elements that determine 
the character of a literature that of race ; and 
even this tie is a weak one, since the average Amer- 
ican citizen can boast but a small fraction of En- 
glish blood. 

But following this argument, it is asked, Why not 
a Mexican, a Brazilian, a Peruvian literature? 
Why not, indeed? It is a mere matter of time. 
There may sometime be twenty literatures in the 
Spanish language. The poet of the Amazon and 
the Orinoco, the singer of sweet songs of the Cor- 
dilleras and the Pampas, the martial lyrist who fires 
the patriotism of the Andean republics, are they 
making Spanish literature? It is inevitable that 
the people of the American republics shall grow 
constantly away from their European parents, in 
spirit, in individuality, in everything. The new soil, 
the new skies, the new environment, the new epoch 
with its new problems, all can have but one result. 
The time must come when the line is to be drawn 
between literatures of the old and the new. It is a 
mere matter of when. But with the United States 
of America there should be now no question.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A WORLD -ANTHOLOGY OF POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On reading Mr. F. L. Thompson's communication on 
a proposed "World- Anthology of Lyric Poetry," in your 
last issue, I must at least express my hearty wish to see 
the work speedily undertaken on some of the lines laid 
down. The value to the student of the comparative 
method of literary study can hardly be overestimated, 
and this method, as I understand, is the basis of Mr. 
Thompson's suggestion. There will be great difficulty, 



246 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1 



of course, in making the work proposed a worthy com- 
panion of Mr. Palgrave's in point of taste, for in all 
these years, and with all our anthologies, we have had 
only one Mr. Palgrave. I do not know of any foreign 
anthologists of his calibre; yet if such exist we shall still 
want a coordinating Palgrave to put the whole together. 
Perhaps, however, we shall do wrong if we demand ab- 
solute genius in the matter. Honest talents and sure 
scholarship ought, it would seem, to give us a working 
basis and to ensure us a volume or volumes that would 
fairly serve the purposes Mr. Thompson has in view. 
How to procure the needed cooperation will, of course, 
be the most difficult question confronting us; and per- 
haps the most practical solution at present might be 
the endeavor to get the Messrs. Macmillan to have their 
French and German anthologies in the " Golden Treas- 
ury " series revised, and to add to them similar volumes 
covering the other great literatures. After such a series 
of volumes had run the gauntlet of criticism and been 
subjected to revision, the work of coordination might be 
begun ; and whether it were successful or not, we should 
at least have a number of anthologies that would be very 
helpful to the student of poetry. 

With regard now to the lines on which the final work 
should be conducted, I must confess that I should not 
envy the editor's task, unless he stuck quite close to the 
normal categories, comparing sonnets with sonnets, odes 
with odes, elegies with elegies. An anthology based on 
such a conception of lyric poetry as Mr. Thompson sug- 
gests, would be helpful also, but more I think to the 
general reader than to the student, who can never, in 
my opinion, long let go the idea oiform without serious 
loss to his work. This leads me to remark that unless 
Mr. Thompson himself acts on his own interesting sug- 
gestion, or induces others to do so, in the near future, 
we shall in all probability find that some such work as 
he describes will grow naturally out of the study of the 
categories of poetry that is even now taking the place 
of the wider and less systematic study practised in the 
past. Critics are beginning to see that a study of the 
evolution of genres is forced upon us by the application 
of the scientific, comparative method to literature. Men 
are studying the ode as it has manifested itself in the 
different literatures, or the elegy, or the sonnet. Such 
students will sooner or later give us comparative anthol- 
ogies on narrower lines than those suggested by Mr. 
Thompson, but I should think that a larger anthology 
would grow out of them. 

In conclusion, I must call attention to the fact that 
while the student as well as the general reader would 
be greatly aided by a World-Anthology, such a book 
could never relieve the conscientious critic from much 
of his present drudgery. The critic must know the bad 
as well as the good, before he can feel that he has fairly 
mastered the evolution of any category of literature. I 
think I speak advisedly in this matter, for I have been 
for some years investigating the evolution of the elegy, 
and I am sure that I have rarely failed to learn some- 
thing even from the most worthless specimens of it that 
I have examined. I will not say that my aesthetic sense 
was profited by the broadside epicedions or the academic 
elegiacs that I have passed over in the British Museum, 
but I will say that I have a far more correct knowledge 
of the evolution of the English elegy than I should have 
had if I had confined my attention to a study of the mas- 
terpieces like " Lycidas " and " Adonai's." The love- 
elegies of Hammond are not interesting in themselves, 
but they are interesting in their relations with those of 



Tibullus and in connection with the contemporary latiniz- 
ing of English poetry in point of form. And this leads 
me to say that in addition to Mr. Thompson's anthology, 
we want a new edition of Chalmers, if not a cheap corpus 
of English drama and poetry on an even greater scale 
than the notable Autores Espanoles. -yy p TRENT

THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LYRICS. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

That is a stimulating idea put forth by Mr. Thomp- 
son in your issue for October 16. A " World- Anthology 
of Lyric Poetry," prepared adequately, would win the 
gratitude of all lovers of verse. Indeed, the comparative 
study of the particular forms of poetry or of the partic- 
ular divisions of literature belongs to those higher 
ranges of literary investigation sure to come in the future. 

Criticism of ways and means is inevitable. The ques- 
tion of selection makes trouble at once: I find myself 
very dubious about two at least of the authors in Mr. 
Thompson's list-by-way-of-suggestion. There is danger, 
too, in giving up the chronological arrangement, which 
is valuable in emphasizing organic development, and, on 
the side of language, has its advantages as well in indi- 
cating linguistic growth. Then for a practical consid- 
eration such a work would be very expensive, and pub- 
lishers would be shy of a volume which, because of its 
polyglot character, would appeal to the few. But that 
is no objection to the idea as such, which I should be 
only too happy to see carried out. Certainly the field 
is clear for such a work. RICHARD BURTON.

THE UNITY OF LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The proposed " World- Anthology of Lyric Poetry," 
outlined by a correspondent in your last issue, would be 
very interesting reading in itself, and as instructive as 
it would be interesting. I should welcome it for its own 
sake, and also as a testimony in favor of a truth we 
are ready academically to acknowledge, most of us, I 
fancy, although few of us are yet prepared to apply it 
unfailingly. This truth is that literature has a unity of 
its own; that all literatures are really one in principle, 
however diverse their dialects may be ; that the drama, 
for example, despite its external modifications, is essen- 
tially the same throughout the ages, from Sophocles to 
Ibsen, from Menander to Augier, from Plautus to Mr. 
Harrigan ; that the orator achieves to-day the same end 
as he aimed at two thousand years ago and under the 
same laws; and that the lyric has flowered alike in the 
East and the West, in old Greece and in new America, 
whenever the heart of man was lifted up with joy or 
bowed down by sorrow. 

The proposed Anthology would be an object-lesson to 
all who have not yet grasped this underlying principle 
of comparative literature. BRANDER MATTHEWS.

LETTERS OF VICTOR HUGO.* 

The first instalment of M. Paul Meurice's 
edition of Victor Hugo's Letters justifies the 
expectation that the work would prove one of 
the most important issues of the current pub- 
lishing season. Hugo is shown to have been a 
frank sometimes, as in his remarkable letters 
to Sainte-Beuve, an effusively frank corre- 
spondent ; and of this trait the world (always 
eagerly, and perhaps on the whole honorably 
and profitably, curious as to the essential and 
spiritual arcana of its great men) now receives 
the benefit. We do not mean to imply that in 
these opening letters, written in youth and in 
the golden prime of an active and ambitious 
manhood, the reader will find Hugo reflecting 
on the deeper questions of existence, or endeav- 
oring to frame some passably rational and con- 
solatory solution thereof. To the sound and 
well-digesting reasoning animal, such concerns 
and speculations come later in life, or when one, 
as the Germans expressively phrase it, sein 
Leben hinter sick hat ; and the letters before 
us cover the period during which the writer 
emphatically had life before him the period, 
that is to say, between 1815, when he was 
under his tutor at Paris, and 1845, when his 
earlier laurels as poet, dramatist, novelist, and 
Academician were still fresh upon him. 

The letters in this volume are arranged in 
five groups, according to their recipients ; and 
within each group the arrangement is chrono- 
logical. The first group consists of " Letters 
to his Father and Mother" mainly to the 
former ; the second, of letters "To Adele Hugo 
[his wife] and Others "; the third, of letters 
" To Various Persons," including De Vigny, 
the Abbe De Lamennais, Lamartiue, Baron 
Eckstein, M. Villars, Victor Pavie, Baron Tay- 
lor, Charles Nodier, Paul Lacroix, Armand 
Carrel, M. Thiers, and others ; the fourth, of a 
series of forty-nine letters " To Charles Au- 
gustin Sainte-Beuve "; the fifth, of letters " To 
his Children." In an Appendix are thirteen let- 
ters to the Secretary of the Academic Des Jeux 
Floraux (1819-1823) ; together with seven 
"Additional Letters " to various persons. The 
following extracts from the letters, taken some- 
what at random, will serve better than descrip- 
tion to indicate their general tenor and quality.

Some of Hugo's early ideas of poetic struc- 
ture are given in a characteristic letter to M. 
Louis Pavie, father of Victor Pavie, written in 
1827 (Hugo was born in 1802). 

". . . Tell your young eaglet, dear sir, your Victor, 
that there is another Victor who would envy him if 
envy could coexist with affection his fine poem on 
David, le Juif, la Mer, and le Lac, an ingenious and 
inspired composition, and above all, his charming elegy 
of I' Enfant. ... If my five-and-twenty years (for I 
am near that) gave me some right of advising his eigh- 
teen, I should advise him to be more strict about the 
richness of the rhyme, the only charm of our poetry, 
and, above all, to strive to confine his thoughts as much 
as possible within the limits of the regular strophe. He 
can change the rhythm as often as he likes in the same 
ode, but there should always be an internal regularity 
in the arrangement of the metre. This is the way, in 
my view, to express an idea more forcibly, to give a 
more ample harmony to the style and more value to the 
whole of the composition. I do not, however, lay down 
this as a rule or law, but merely give it for what it is 
worth, as the result of reflections on the genius of our 
lyric poetry. In his case, thought only needs to develop 
freely. I give some advice to the artist, but I submit 
it for the approval of the poet. . . ." 

A letter of January 5, 1830, to the Minister 
of the Interior, written just before the initial 
performance of " Hernani " at the Comedie 
Fran9aise, illustrates the bitterness of the great 
literary feud of the day. Hugo had written the 
drama and submitted it to the government cen- 
sors. Thereafter he says : 

"... This, however, is what has happened since 
Hernani has been submitted to the censors. Some verses 
of the drama, partly travestied, or wholly turned into 
ridicule, a few quoted correctly, but ingeniously dove- 
tailed with spurious ones, bits of scenes, in fact, more or 
less skilfully disfigured and outrageously parodied, have 
been put into circulation. Portions of the work dressed 
up in this way have received the semi-publicity which 
writers and theatres so justly dread. The authors of 
these underhand tricks have hardly taken the trouble to 
hide themselves; they have done it in broad daylight, 
and have simply selected the newspapers as the medium 
of their discreet confidences. They have gone further. 
Not content with prostituting the piece to their papers, 
they are now engaged in prostituting it to their salons. 

" There are only two copies of Hernani in existence 
besides the one in my house. One has been lodged at 
the theatre ; that is the one used every day for rehearsals. 
As soon as the rehearsal is over the manuscript is put 
under lock and key. The other manuscript is in the 
censor's office. Now pirated copies are being circulated. 
Where can they come from ? I ask once more. From 
the theatre, whose hopes they would blight, whose inter- 
ests they would ruin, where the greatest caution is ob- 
served, where the thing is an impossibility, or from 
the censors ? The censorship has one manuscript at its 
disposal, with which it can do what it likes. The cen- 
sorship is my literary and political enemy. It has the 
privilege of being dishonest and disloyal. I impeach 
the censorship." 

The following month Hugo writes triumph-

antly to Paul Lacroix, on returning from the 
second performance of " Hernani." 

" Thank you a thousand times, my dear, good friend. 
I see your kind heart in all you do for me. I wish you 
had been at the theatre to-night. You would have 
laughed. The classic cabal wanted to bite, and did bite, 
but thanks to our friends it broke its teeth. The third 
act got some rough treatment, which it will receive for 
some time to come, but the fourth act silenced opposi- 
tion, and the fifth went admirably, better even than the 
first time. Mile. Mars surpassed herself. She was 
recalled, cheered, and overwhelmed with applause. She 
was enchanted. 

" I think we are all right now. The receipts of the 
two first nights amounted to nine thousand francs, 
which is unprecedented at this theatre. But we must not 
rest on our laurels. The enemy is on the alert. The 
third performance must discourage them, if possible. 
Therefore, in the name of our cherished literary free- 
dom, summon the whole clan of brave and faithful friends 
for Monday. I look to you to help me in pulling out 
this last tooth of the old classic Pegasus. To the rescue, 
and advance ! " 

Hugo's noble letter (1834) to M. Thiers, in 
behalf of an unfortunate fellow-member of the 
literary guild, is one of several of like tenor. 

" Monsieur le Ministre, At this moment there is a 
woman in Paris who is dying of hunger. 

" Her name is Mile. Mercosur. She has published 
several volumes of poems; this is not the place to speak 
of their merit, and besides, I do not feel qualified to do 
so; but her name is doubtless known to you. 

" In 1823 King Louis XVIII. spontaneously assigned 
me a pension or annual allowance of 2000 francs on the 
funds of the Ministry of the Interior. In 1832 I gave 
up this pension of my own free will. At that time your 
predecessor, M. d'Argout, informed me that he did not 
accept my surrender of it, that he would continue to 
consider the money as mine, and that he would not dis- 
pose of it in favor of anyone. As my renunciation was 
absolute and final, it was no business of mine to see what 
the Minister would do with the pension. 

" To-day, while admitting that I have no claim what- 
ever on this pension, I request you, in case the Minister 
should have persisted in his resolve, and should not have 
disposed of the fund to anyone else, to transfer it to 
Mile. Merco3ur. If you consent to this, I shall feel 
doubly pleased at having given it up. This pension will 
be far better bestowed on Mile. Mercosur than on me. 
The sum of 1200 francs, added to what Mile. Mercosur 
already receives, will almost enable her to live with her 
mother. Give it to her, Monsieur le Ministre; it will 
be an act of charity. We shall both be glad ; you for 
having done it, and I for having advised it." 

From the interesting series of letters to 
Sainte-Beuve (1827-1845) we shall allow our- 
selves a brief extract touching the writer's polit- 
ical views in 1832. 

"... It is indeed a sad, but at the same time a fine, 
subject for a poem, all this folly steeped in bloodshed. 
We shall have a Republic some day, and when it does 
come it will be a good one. But we must not gather in 
May the fruit which will not be ripe till August. We 
must know how to wait. The Republic proclaimed by 
France in Europe will be the crown of our old age. But 



we must not let our flag be smeared with red by these 
blackguards. For instance, a Fre'de'ric Soulie*, who a 
year ago was devoted to M. d'Argout's dramatic quasi- 
censorship, must not be allowed to bawl out in the mid- 
dle of a cafe that he is going to make bullets. A Fon- 
tan must not be permitted to announce in a pot-house 
that by the end of the month four splendid guillotines 
will be permanently set up in the four principal squares 
of Paris. People of this kind throw back the political 
ideas which, but for them, would make progress. They 
frighten the honest tradesman, who is made savage by 
reaction. They make a bugbear of the Republic. Ninety- 
three is not much of a bait. We ought to talk a little 
less of Robespierre and a little more of Washington . . ." 

Hugo's letters to his children are charming 
compositions tender, playful, and filled with 
the fancies a child loves. To his little daughter 
Didine he writes ( 1837 ) from Boulogne-sur- 
Mer : 

" I have just been walking on the beach and thinking 
of you, my poor little darling. I gathered this flower 
for you on the sandhills. It is a wild pansy, which has 
been often watered by the foam of the ocean. Keep it 
for daddy's sake, who is so fond of you. I have already 
sent your mother a flower from the ruins, the Ghent 
poppy, and now here is a flower from the sea. And 
then, my darling, I wrote your name on the sand, Didi. 
To-night the rising tide will obliterate it, but nothing 
can ever obliterate your father's love for you. 

" I have constantly thought of you, dear child. Every 
fine town I saw made me wish that you, your mother, 
and your brothers had been with me, and your grand- 
father, to explain everything to us. All day I was look- 
ing at churches and pictures, and then at night I gazed 
at the sky, and thought once more of you, my Didine, 
as I watched that beautiful constellation, the Chariot of 
God, which I have taught you to distinguish among the 
stars." 

M. Meurice's editing of Hugo's Letters is 
of the most unobtrusive sort, the volume con- 
taining no editorial apparatus whatever save a 
table of contents and some brief footnotes. The 
publishers have done their part in their usual 
satisfactory way. The volume is a model of 
substantial elegance throughout, the noble typo- 
graphy calling for special commendation.

NINETEENTH CENTURY PAINTING.* 



After reading the first volume of Professor 
Muther's rather ponderous " History of Mod- 
ern Painting," one is inclined to think that its 
author's merit should be handsomely allowed. 
It is well written, critically accurate, and con- 
tinuous in its development. With the second 
volume, matters begin to grow somewhat com- 
plicated ; the writer meets with contemporary

Mather. In three volumes, with illustrations. New York :

men and their works ; there is not so much his- 
torical perspective ; the body of established art 
criticism offers less suggestion and support ; the 
continuity is rather shattered. With the third 
volume one begins to realize the awfulness of 
a German philosophy of history. Men and 
facts are pushed out of all chronology and se- 
quence, and we are dragged from Germany to 
America, from Japan to England, and asked 
to consider this man or that man simply as an 
illustration of Professor Muther's theories. 
When one finally puts down the work and tries 
to recall its impression as a whole, he has dif- 
ficulty in obtaining a good negative. Either 
his perception is not good, or the plate has 
been befogged. The latter is really the case. 
Professor Muther has sacrificed clearness and 
continuity to theory, system, and classification. 

The introduction to the first volume explains 
that this sacrifice is in measure intentional. 
Professor Muther lays no claim to an objective 
treatment of history. He declares that his work 
is " no more than a piece of art-history seen 
through the medium of a temperament." But 
that is about all any history is or can be. All 
writing is temperamental ; but then there are 
temperaments and there are temperaments. 
Some are content with recording a plain under- 
standing of facts in chronological order and 
allowing that to stand as history ; others are 
disposed toward the philosophical system with 
concatenated sub-divisions under which men 
and their doings are placed as props for the 
system. The philosophy of history is not to be 
sneered at, but in order to be serviceable it 
should at least be comprehensible. Nor is logic 
a non-essential in the writing of history ; but 
again, to be serviceable it should at least be 
convincing. Professor Muther in his introduc- 
tion to the second volume asks : " Is history 
governed by the laws of logic ? " Yes ; but what 
may be logic to the writer may have no logical 
meaning whatever to the reader, and the weak- 
ness of Professor Muther's history is a prepon- 
derance of what he esteems philosophy and 
logic. If it were not for a non-philosophical 
non-logical index of painters' names at the end 
of each volume, the real value of this work 
would be materially lessened. But the reader 
should have an outline of Professor Muther's 
temperamental system. 

The history begins with the discovery of the 
modern spirit in painting. Hogarth, Reynolds, 
and Gainsborough, in England, are put down 
as its representatives. We are then taken to 
Spain, where Goya is resurrected as a typical 



innovator and revolutionist in art and put on 
the shelf with Goethe and Schiller as compan- 
ions. Then we are taken to Germany and intro- 
duced to Winckelmann and the revised classic ; 
then to France, to see classicism with David ; 
then there is a chapter on the attempt to escape 
from tradition ; and there are chapters on the 
Italian tradition in Germany, romanticism, In- 
gres and the classic reaction, the post-romantic 
painters like Cabanel, Lefebvre and Delau- 
nay, the schools in Belgium, and the German 
colorists like Makart. After these comes a 
chapter in which we go back in French his- 
tory to Gleyre, Hamon, and Boulanger, with 
whom we find curiously associated Leys, Becker, 
Menzel, and Meissonier. This last chapter 
is somewhat hazy, giving indication of what 
is to come ; but from the first volume we learn 
one of Professor Muther's theories. Art is 
tossed back and forth like a tennis-ball, from 
classicism to romanticism, until at last it falls 
to earth and becomes realism. The theory is 
quite just, and is supported by the facts. 

The second volume begins with the " Victory 
of the Moderns " which means that painting 
has reached a point where actual life rather 
than tradition is its inspiration. The second 
chapter takes up " English Painting to 1850," 
and deals with Romney, Hoppner, Beechey, 
and others. Now why should these men be 
separated by five hundred pages from Reynolds 
and Gainsborough ? They were all influenced 
by Sir Joshua, were all of the same school, pro- 
duced a similar art, and should have been 
treated together. Directly we are through with 
them we are hurried off to the military painters 
in France Vernet, Raffet, Charlet, who be- 
longed to Delacroix's time ; and to the Orien- 
talists Decamps, Marilhat, Fromentin, who 
were just as much the product of romanticism 
as Delacroix himself. Why were they not con- 
sidered under romanticism, three hundred 
pages back ? And why, under any historical or 
philosophical system, should men like Fred- 
erick Goodall and Pasini be put in the same 
chapter with them, since they have nothing in 
common but subject ? But Professor Muther 
has been treating, first, of movements like clas- 
sicism and romanticism ; then he tries art- 
history by countries, and in this second volume 
he thinks to try it by subjects. So we have 
chapters on the " Painting of Humorous Anec- 
dote," dealing with the genre painters of Ger- 
many ; " The Picture with a Social Purpose," 
where Delacroix, Meissonier, and Wiertz are 
brought together ; " The Village Tale," which 



250 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



introduces Knaus, Defregger, and Jules Bre- 
ton, but omits Theodore Frere, Millet, and 
Bastien ; chapters upon landscape which are 
thoroughly good ; and finally we are brought 
with a bump to " Realism in France," which 
means Gourbet, Stevens, and Vollon, " Real- 
ism in England," which means Holman Hunt 
and the Pre - Raphaelites, and "Realism in 
Germany," which means Menzel, Leibl, and 
Lenbach. This loud pa3an of realism would 
seem to mark the grand finale of the second 
volume ; but Professor Muther winds on for 
three chapters more, telling us about the 
" Problem of the Modern Intuition of Color " 
(a luminous caption), in which the realists be- 
fore mentioned are credited with arriving at 
maturity in color the inference being that 
Chardin and Corot before them had not arrived. 
There is a digressive chapter just here on Ho- 
kusai and the Japanese, the object of it being 
to explain the Japanese influence upon Euro- 
pean art ; and then we have for a last chapter 
" Fiat Lux," in which impressionism is consid- 
ered as realism widened by the study of the 
milieu. 

One might think that a chapter devoted to 
impressionism Monet, Renoir, and their con- 
temporaries would be about the last word on 
modern art, and that when the brains were out 
the book would end. But no ; there is a third 
volume, and the opening chapter calls us cheer- 
fully back to consider Bastien-Lepage, L'her- 
mitte, and others who sprang from the Courbet- 
Millet initiative and should have been treated 
under " Realism in France." They are, how- 
ever, grouped under " Painters of Life," and 
the chapters are again taken up by countries. 
Leighton, Poynter, and their adherents are dis- 
cussed under " England," and then Professor 
Muther wanders from Bagdad to Peru through 
chapters on Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Russia, 
and America, before he again brings us around to 
England to take up Rossetti and Burne-Jones, 
who should have been placed in point of time 
and school with Holman Hunt nineteen chapters 
back, and Watts, who belongs with Leighton 
and Poynter, ten chapters back. The reason for 
this ramble is apparent in the book headings. 
Leighton and Poynter are classified as " Paint- 
ers of Life," while Rosetti, Burne-Jones, and 
Watts are pigeon-holed as "New Idealists." 
Professor Muther's nomenclature is ingenuous 
and his classification perhaps philosophical, but 
was it worth while dislocating all the bones of 
chronology and breaking the neck of continuity 
to attain them ? Whistler is evidently a round 



stone who will not fit into a square hole, how- 
ever philosophical it may be made ; and so he 
is placed in a separate chapter under "Whist- 
ler and the Scotch Painters " a chapter that 
will doubtless make its chief subject smile. 
And so, barring a sporadic return to Bocklin 
and German art, tagged on apparently as an 
after-thought, the three- volumed work comes to 
an end. 

Professor Muther's history is a good illus- 
tration of a philosophical system, clear enough 
to its author's mind, proving a cloud -bank 
to the mind of the reader. Chronology, na- 
tionality, historical sequence, and school influ- 
ence are sacrificed to various " isms " known 
in the creed of German esthetics and " seen 
through the medium of a temperament." This 
would not be matter of much regret were the 
work as confused in detail as it is in plan. It 
could then be pushed aside and forgotten. But 
this work cannot be so treated. In just appre- 
ciation of art, in critical estimates of painters, 
in keen analysis of motives, it is by all odds 
the best history of nineteenth century painting 
yet written. Used as a reference book by the 
aid of the index, it is invaluable in its critical 
summaries. Moreover, it is correct in its facts. 
There are slips here and there, as there must 
be in every history dates wrong, names mis- 
spelled, picture titles erroneously given but 
these are small matters to be overlooked. Gen- 
erally speaking, the work is accurate in fact 
and sound in judgment. It is not to be sup- 
posed that any one man can deal thoroughly 
with all phases of modern art, in all coun- 
tries with equal knowledge. Professor Muther 
is at his best in dealing with German art ; but 
he understands modern painting in France, 
England, the Low Countries, Italy, and Spain 
very well. The chapter on Russian painting 
is written in collaboration with Alexandre 
Benois, and the chapter on American paint- 
ing is somewhat scrappy the author never 
having been here. For what America has 
done and is doing, he relies upon books and 
what he has seen of American art in the Paris 
Salons. This has misled him into saying of 
American painters generally that " their art is 
an exact echo of that of Europe, because they 
have learnt their technique in the leading Eu- 
ropean academies." After such a statement 
it is not surprising to find the Parisian and 
Munich contingents of American painters re- 
ceiving full notice, while men at home, like 
Healy, Eastman Johnson, Thayer, Simmons, 
Smedley, Brush, Blashfield, and Mowbray are

omitted altogether. Among our landscapists, 
too, there is mention of Inness, Tryon, Murphy, 
Ranger ; but not a word about Homer Mar- 
tin, Wyant, Bunce, Platt, Dearth, or Horatio 
Walker. 

Still, with all its small faults and its bewil- 
dering classification, Professor Muther's his- 
tory has very decided merits. It is the first 
history of nineteenth century painting that has 
any pretension to completeness ; it treats paint- 
ing as painting rather than as story-telling upon 
canvas ; and it is written in a bright, free style, 
with a candid spirit, both of which merits peo- 
ple will not fail to appreciate. Considering the 
difficulties of such a task as the author set for 
himself, it is somewhat remarkable that he has 
come off so well. He has produced a work of 
no commonplace character ; and after devoting 
so much space to pointing out its defects, it is 
worth while to insist that it has virtues which 
far out-balance its faults. It will not become 
obsolete very soon. Readers and writers will 
soon discover its value, and to both of them it 
will prove a mine of facts for many years to 
come. 

The translation is not too well done, and it 
strains good English at times to the breaking 
point. The attempt to render literal meanings 
is not happy, and sometimes it is quite shocking 
as, for instance, in the chapter on " Whistler 
and the Scotch Painters," in which men like 
Lavery and Guthrie are referred to as the 
*' Boys of Glasgow " and the " Glasgow Boys." 
It cannot be supposed that Professor Muther 
would be so familiar or so undignified as to use 
such expressions about men as old as himself. 
The translator has simply failed to comprehend 
the text. 

There is great wealth of illustration in the 
volumes some fifteen hundred " half-tones," 
many of them good and some of them bad. It 
could not very well be otherwise. The photo- 
graphy of pictures is still a problem, the color 
element wrecking, for reproductive purposes, 
about three photographs out of four. Again, 
many of the best pictures for historical illustra- 
tion have never been photographed and are 
inaccessible. The historian must do what he 
can, not what he would ; and Professor Muther, 
considering the circumstances, has done as well 
as could be expected.

STUDIES IN EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY.* 

Of late years there has been a marked ten- 
dency among students of American history to 
devote attention to early colonial history, the 
original inspiration, no doubt, coming from the 
work of John Richard Green in English his- 
tory. The development of the spirit of genea- 
logical research, greatly stimulated by the 
formation and growth of patriotic hereditary 
societies, has had as an accompaniment the 
awakening of interest in the old town records, 
and in the less important but equally instruc-

taining and suggestive volumes. The book-

" Beneath Old Roof Trees," by Mr. Abram 
English Brown, is certain to please anyone who 
cares for the heroes of the Revolution. The 
binding shows the old bell-tower in Lexington, 
with an accompanying picture of a minute-man, 
ploughing in the field, but all ready to drop the 
implements of husbandry for the musket and 
the powder-horn which his boy is bringing him 
from the house. Stories of the great struggle 
for liberty are told as they have been gathered 
from the lips of old people, here and there, 
the veritable sons and daughters of the Revo- 
lution. There are pictures of historic homes, 
many of them now bearing tablets, which tell 
of their connection with the dawn of Independ- 
ence. There are inscriptions from many mon- 
uments, there are fragments from diaries, there 
are bits of song and story ; in fact, there seems 
to be a complete collection of material illustra- 
tive of the part played in the Revolution by the 
people from the towns located on both sides of 
a line drawn from Groton to Boston. " The

Foot-prints of the Patriots " is the name for the 
series of which this volume is the first. Young 
people will rejoice to hear the story told again, 
and older ones, especially those who are proud 
of membership in the various patriotic societies, 
will find in Mr. Brown's work much to stimu- 
late their devotion to the memories of the men 
who made the Nation. 

" Old Colony Days," by Mrs. May Alden 
Ward, affords fresh gleanings from fields that 
have been made familiar by Mrs. Earle and 
Mr. Bliss. The little volume consists of a series 
of essays, which sometimes overlap in their 
scope. Three of them have personality as the 
basis, dealing with William Bradford, " The 
Father of American History "; the Mather dy- 
nasty and other clergymen, illustrating the 
" early autocrat of New England "; and Samuel 
Sewall, "an old-time magistrate." The two 
other papers treat of the delusions of the fore- 
fathers, and their attempts at making poetry. 
There is quite a bit of new matter presented in 
this popular form, and the volume is welcomed 
as a desirable part of the literature which is 
familiarizing Americans of this day with the 
life of the fathers, and familiarizing them with 
it in such a way that even in the midst of the 
quaint and curious the reader learns to under- 
stand better the motives that controlled the 
dwellers in " Old Colony Days." 

Mrs. Earle has been generous in giving to 
the students of various phases of American life 
the rich results of her investigations in the store- 
houses of colonial lore. " The Sabbath in Puri- 
tan New England," " Customs and Fashions of 
Old New England," "The Diary of Anna 
Green Winslow," " Colonial Dames and Good 
Wives," " Costumes of Colonial Times," The 
Life of Margaret Winthrop," such are the 
themes that have been exhaustively treated by 
her, to make no mention of magazine articles 
dealing with old china, flower gardens, strange 
and curious punishments, and other subjects 
suggested by hints from musty books, court 
records, old letters, and forgotten laws. In 
treating " Colonial Days in New York," diffi- 
culties presented themselves at once. Contem- 
porary chronicles are rare. There was no Sewall 
and no Winthrop. The diary-writing minister 
was not a Dutch character. Mrs. Anne Grant 
had told the story of the life of " An American 
Lady" wherein Miss Schuyler's experiences cast 
light upon the social conditions of the colony ; 
Madame Sarah Knight had included the colony 
in the itinerary of her carefully described 
travels, and others had studied special features 



of the social history ; but there was no wealth 
of materials. Mrs. Earle has, however, been 
equal to her task, for in " Colonial Days in Old 
New York " the life in New Netherlands may 
be followed from the birth of the child and the 
rocking in the hooded cradle, until the coffin 
was lowered into the grave, with its attendant 
feasting and drinking and giving of funeral 
rings and scarfs and gloves. The education of 
the child, the dress of child and man, the cus- 
toms of courtship and marriage, the furniture, 
linen, eatables, drinkables, and dishes of the 
home, the beginnings of municipal life with its 
necessary police and sanitary regulations, all 
these find place in the story. The hard life of 
the schoolmaster, who sometimes eked out his 
slender income by doing washing or digging 
graves ; the difficulties of the physician, who 
sought a monopoly of shaving to add to his 
revenue ; the ever-present problem of domestic 
service, and the busy industry of the women 
for which New Netherlands was noted, such 
are the varied subjects that are discussed. 
There were generally-celebrated holidays, such 
as New Year's Day, May Day, Shrove-Tide, 
Gunpowder Day, and the forgotten anniver- 
sary called " Pinkster Day," when the negroes 
had much liberty, and gave way to excesses of 
drinking and dancing and barbaric music. 
More pleasure seems to have been allowed than 
in Puritan New England, their pastimes rang- 
ing from simple strawberrying to the theatre 
and horse-racing. Perhaps the most instruc- 
tive feature of Mrs. Earle's study is the setting 
forth of the position of women in the colony. 
They shared the property of their husbands, 
oftentimes managed large business interests, 
sometimes even served as attorneys in court, 
and in general had a higher standing in the 
community than did their New England sisters. 
But a paragraph can hardly do justice to this 
interesting volume of three hundred pages, each 
one of which has something worth noting in a 
study of social life. The cover of the book 
anticipates the delights of the contents. It is 
distinctively Dutch, reproducing the design of 
a white and blue cloth, and decorated with sug- 
gestive windmill, beaver, and beer keg. 

A much more pretentious work is " The 
Puritan in England and New England," by 
Dr. Ezra Hoyt Byington. The title has a 
familiar sound, and comparison is at once sug- 
gested with other volumes that have covered 
much the same ground. But the reader leaves 
the book, thoroughly satisfied with the author. 
In the first place, it is an attractive volume

typographically, a good example of modern his- 
torical book-making. The type is large and 
clear, the margins are wide, and everything is 
present that is desirable in the way of enlarged 
table of contents, bibliography, page divisions, 
and index. One may read awhile and stop, 
without losing the story, for the method is top- 
ical, the author having used the substance of 
the several chapters as addresses before organ- 
izations of sympathetic nature. There are eight 
of these special themes : " The Puritan in En- 
gland," " The Pilgrim and the Puritan : 
Which ? " The Early Ministers of New En- 
gland," " William Pynchon, Gent.," " Family 
and Social Life of the Puritans," " Religious 
Opinions of the Fathers of New England," 
" The Case of Reverend Robert Breck, of 
Springfield," and " The Religious Life in the 
Eighteenth Century in Northern New En- 
gland," the last a study of Brunswick, Maine. 
The first chapter gives a clear and concise ac- 
count of the development of the Puritan party 
in England, without any of the long quotations 
from contemporary sermons which too often 
only befog the student when he is seeking for 
light. No one can read it without feeling a 
sense of gratitude to the author for his simple 
story, and without a better appreciation of the 
character and the purposes of the men who, as 
Pilgrims and Puritans, laid the foundations of 
the New England colonies. The same clear- 
ness marks the chapter on religious opinions, 
where the various differences are discussed. A 
special case of theological investigation is de- 
scribed in Springfield, where attempts were 
made to prevent the settlement as pastor of 
Robert Breck. There are a great many pages 
in the book that tell of the social life of the 
Puritan, and indicate that there was more 
attention paid to the graces and refinements of 
life than is usually thought. In some of the 
volumes dealing with the homes of the period, 
the quaint and curious seem to be mentioned 
merely for the entertainment of the reader. In 
this study, the relation of the various features 
of society to the history of the time is well 
brought out, the philosophy of the Puritan 
regime being prominent. Now and then there 
is an apparent inconsistency, as, for example, 
where in one paragraph the treatment of the 
Quakers is not excused by the fact that Quakers 
everywhere were being persecuted, while in the 
next paragraph the witchcraft delusion is 
smoothed over because the belief in witchcraft 
was common throughout the world. But on 



the whole the author treats his themes in a way 
to win commendation, and to secure for his book 
its proper place among the best of those that 
furnish insight into Puritan life and character. 
Mr. Coffin's study of the Province of Quebec 
in its relation to the early days of the Amer- 
ican Revolution is associated with the four 
volumes already discussed only by the law of 
contrast, since it represents an entirely different 
method of investigation of historical problems 
connected with Anglo-American colonial life. 
There were other English colonies in America 
besides the thirteen which revolted. Why did 
they 'not join the Revolution? What was the 
effect of the success of the thirteen upon the 
political life of the others? Such questions 
were in the mind of the writer as he began his 
investigations, only to find that he must confine 
himself to the Province of Quebec alone. The 
central point of the study is the Quebec Act of 
1774, which is considered both as an institu- 
tional measure and as an irritating aid to the 
discontent of the colonists south of the St. Law- 
rence. Conclusions are reached which are 
widely at variance with those usually held by 
writers of our history. It is considered that 
the provisions of the Quebec Act were neither 
occasioned nor appreciably affected by condi- 
tions in the other colonies, and that the meas- 
ure was not effectual in keeping the Canadians 
loyal in the time of prevailing discontent. Most 
writers have expressed the belief that the Que- 
bec Act was highly beneficial to the province 
affected by it. Mr. Coffin's investigations have 
convinced him that, on the contrary, it was 
really one of the most unwise and disastrous 
measures in English Colonial history. So far 
as the United States were concerned, interest 
in the Quebec Act ceased after independence 
had been secured ; but, for Canada, influences 
were set in motion which have had unfortunate 
results ever since. Space will not allow con- 
sideration of the several very interesting phases 
of the subject ; but it is to be said that this 
monograph is a valuable contribution to Amer- 
ican history, written in good style, with abun- 
dant references to sustain conclusions, with 
illustration afforded by the experience of the 
United States as the Act is considered after a 
century and a quarter, and with a bibliography 
of the most important authorities. The Quebec 
Act and the Quebec Revenue Act, both of the 
year 1774, accompany the study as original 
documents.

THE INTELLECTUAL, METHOD isr 
PSYCHOLOGY.* 

Psychologists are now divided into three 
hostile camps. In the first are the physiolog- 
ical psychologists, who interpret all mental 
states by organic changes or motor activities ; 
in the second are those who base all mind on 
feeling and will, and, being rather a small 
school, have not as yet received any distinctive 
name ; in the third are the intellectualists, who 
see in knowledge the fundamental element in 
mental life. And these three standpoints, it 
must be noted, are the only possible ones, and 
all three have now their enthusiastic adherents. 

The intellectual is the oldest and most nat- 
ural of the three methods. On awaking this 
morning did there not first come to your mind 
a flood of sensations, of sights, sounds, con- 
tacts, etc. which you interpreted ? And when 
you found an interesting sensation produced, 
let us say, by a pretty picture on the wall 
you dwelt upon it. But suddenly you hear a 
sound, which you interpret as the breakfast 
bell ; this incites a considerable emotion, which 
in turn incites to lively action ; you hurriedly 
arise and dress. 

That all mind is based on a series of given 
presentations, which are interpreted by thought, 
is the doctrine not only of common reflection, 
but of the most ancient philosophy of mediaeval 
scholasticism, and of most modern philosophy 
and psychology as well. It is the standpoint 
of the work on " Analytic Psychology " now 
before us. These two large volumes are writ- 
ten by Mr. G. F. Stout, who is best known as 
editor of the English psychological review, 
" Mind," and consist largely of summaries and 
discussions founded upon Messrs. Ward, James, 
Bradley, Brentano, and Bain. The work has 
some originality of treatment, and at all times 
the position advanced is carefully re-thought 
and re -stated in the writer's own way, 
although we think quotation is sometimes over- 
done. While this book is in no sense popular, 
it will yet appeal strongly to all critical stu- 
dents of psychology ; and while we cannot count 
ourselves among the intellectual school, we yet 
readily recognize the service of honest and able 
thought from that point of view. With this 
general appreciation, let us pass to some criti- 
cisms which might be of interest to the general 
reader. 

The average layman, after reading the chap- 

* ANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY. By G. F. Stout, Fellow of St. 
John's College, Cambridge. In two volumes. New York : 
The Macmillan Co. 



ter on "Pleasure and Pain," will no doubt 
exclaim, " What a pother about so simple a 
thing ! Of course, when I am in pain it means 
there is something the matter ; all is not go- 
ing on right ; I do not need learned terms 
like ' arrest of mental activity ' or ' disturbance 
of equilibrium,' and pages of discussion about 
facts as self-evident as that the heart pumps 
blood and the lungs breathe air." The present 
reviewer appreciates this objection, and thinks 
that psychologists are but too apt to turn tru- 
isms into disputable principles. Mr. Stout's 
discussion does not bring out the real difficulty, 
which is that all effort is in itself painful. For 
example, my attention to the point now under 
consideration is hard and painful to me ; and 
that not as a hindrance to my doing something 
else, for there is nothing I want to do, but in 
itself as task and effort. The pain of that most 
useful, salutary, and satisfactory action in the 
world, endeavor at top-notch, seems quite in- 
trinsic. 

Mr. Stout devotes much space to Attention ; 
and one section on " Interest and Attention " 
invites some remarks. The problem, put con- 
cretely, is this : Do you attend to a thing 
because you are interested in it, or are you in- 
terested because you attend? or is there no 
" because " in the case, only the fact that we 
find the two together ? Mr. Stout thinks that 
interest is the " hedonic aspect " of attention, 
thus maintaining the intellectualist form of the 
last position, the emotionalist form being 
that attention is a volitional aspect of interest, 
though both indicate a certain causality. How- 
ever, we must confess at the start to a prejudice 
against all " aspect " theories. What do we 
gain by saying that one phenomenon is simply 
the reverse side of another, except to appease 
our ignorance by a doubtful metaphor ? " As- 
pect " is at best no other than a metaphysical 
dualism, or pluralism, brought in as scientific 
explanation. 

, But let us turn to a simple case for facts. 
As I have some interest in old books, I often 
stop at a stall and let my eye wander over the 
books there exposed. I see a multitude of 
books that do not hold my attention ; but sud- 
denly an old book attracts me. As this added 
interest makes me more attentive, I perceive 
that it is an incuncibulum, which interest in- 
creases my attention, and I find it to be a very 
rare Aldine. This process, which began as 
interest awakening attention, and goes on by 
attention increasing interest, and interest atten- 
tion, by rapid steps, is a typical case which 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



255 



cannot be construed as " hedonic aspect " ex- 
cept by ignoring analysis, and this analytic psy- 
chology cannot do. It is true enough, as Mr. 
Stout says (Vol. I., p. 226), that we cannot 
feel satisfied with an object unless we have 
already begun to attend to it ; but why do we 
begin to attend to it, except at the prompting 
of some interest? It is obvious that we must 
see a thing before we can take an interest in 
the thing as seen ; but it is because we have 
some interest that we look for it or at it. And 
the initiatory interest is often something quite 
obscure and hereditary. For instance, the fact 
that moving objects always draw our attention 
in preference to non-moving, that a fleet under 
way is more interesting than at anchor, are 
doubtless due to the ingrained structure of mind, 
since organisms have always from the begin- 
ning found themselves most vitally affected by 
the moving objects. It is the moving object 
which may be food, or an enemy, or a mate ; 
and so the moving as a whole becomes more 
interesting than the stationary. We can con- 
ceive the opposite as the case, that the sta- 
tionary might have been the most significant 
and most interesting for life.

THE ESSAYS OF MRS. MEYNEL.I,.* 

It is not easy to know just how to deal with 
the new volumes by which Mrs. Meynell is pre- 
sented to American readers by American pub- 
lishers. The appearance of a new edition of 
her first collection of essays reminds one imme- 
diately that there must be many who already 
know her work. We surely cannot speak of 
Mrs. Meynell as though she were some new 
writer, some recent addition to the galaxy of 
nowaday talent. And yet we cannot very well 
speak of her new volume as if everyone were 
familiar with her work, as if we had here some- 
thing which the public would read and ap- 
preciate with a certain reference to what has 
gone before. The fact is, I suppose, that the 
work of Mrs. Meynell, though long known 
to one and another, is only now becoming 
generally known to the public, at least in this 
country. 

The present century, like the sixteenth, is a

century of discovery. In the former time they 
discovered pretty much all the places in the 
world, which had till that time lived in happy 
seclusion : nowadays they discover everything 
else. In literature, where the tendency is as 
manifest as in science, religion, daily life, and 
so on, the spirit used to be called Naturalism ; 
the idea being that there were no secrets of the 
soul, or body either, which the novelist might 
not expose. Naturalism, however, seems now 
to have had its day ; and the momentary form 
of the spirit of discovery, as applied to liter- 
ature, is the effort to bring all writers into 
a breezy popularity. There are periodicals 
chiefly for this purpose, and special columns 
for the same purpose in other papers. The aim 
is to make everybody who has written anything 
a public character. 

One good result of such a hustling, up-to- 
date quality in the average writer about books 
is naturally that everything good receives a 
wider currency ; that every good author has a 
larger audience ; that thousands of readers, who 
would otherwise be confined to a few writers 
whom their bookseller happened to know of, 
have a more widely extended horizon. Any- 
one who can have any objection to the process 
would seem to be a dog in the manger. Still, 
looking at the matter from another side, there 
must be many who see their specially selected 
authors rise into the limelight of literary gossip 
with something of the feeling with which one 
goes to a sequestered and personal spot in the 
woods, and finds a large picnic of, say, the Im- 
proved Order of Polish Invincibles. Very good 
people they are, certainly, and it is nice that 
they should have a good time ; still, the world 
is large, and this particular place was my fav- 
orite. 

Whether or not Mrs. Meynell has really 
been discovered of late, we cannot say ; still, 
it would seem so. One may see her picture in 
better or worse reproduction ; one may read 
anecdotes about herself and her husband ; one 
may learn what Rossetti and Ruskin thought 
of her poems. So far as this brings her books 
to more persons who can read and love them, 
so much the better. It would not appear on 
the whole, however, that Mrs. Meynell's genius 
was such as would appeal to a very extended 
circle. But it is hard to tell ; some of her 
things take such a personal hold on one that it 
seems impossible anyone else should care for 
them at all ; and yet undoubtedly the number 
of her readers has been steadily increasing, in 
England and in this country. Her essays, how- 



256

[Nov. 1, 



ever, are certainly not such as one could imag- 
ine widely popular. Emerson may be said to 
be popular in a way : there is a sort of catho- 
licity to him ; he wants to speak to everybody. 
Mrs. Meynell, on the other hand, seems to 
speak especially to a few ; she speaks in a way 
that will not appeal to everybody, and often of 
things that not everybody will understand. 

These essays have in them, doubtless, some 
of the best prose work in their kind that has 
lately been done in England. It is a careful 
prose, not exactly polished, but rather delicate ; 
a kind of work not often seen, for those who 
might aspire to such work are apt to invalidate 
their results by affectation and mannerism. It 
abounds in implied discrimination, and has a 
certain taste for epigram, for a sort of senten- 
tiousness even. It drifts not seldom into im- 
agery ; one must remember a good deal to real- 
ize much of it, just as one must have read more 
or less to pass competently through its allusive- 
ness. Like the prose of Cardinal Newman, it 
has generally the quality of urbanity, the tone 
of the centre that Matthew Arnold sometimes 
spoke of. If anything, it vexes one by being 
over-conscious, or rather too elaborate, very 
rarely by lack of ideas. 

There are ideas enough, although one cannot 
easily say just what kind of ideas. Certainly 
they are not " great thoughts " as a rule, and 
yet the work is hardly ever fantastic or fussy. 
The essays are on different subjects ; it is diffi- 
cult to classify them. Some are on art, some on 
literature, some on nature or other matters, 
but more than is usually the case with such col- 
lections do we get from the book an impression 
of unity in a sentiment, or an attitude toward 
life. The interest of the book lies not so much 
in its treatment of this or that topic as in its 
exhibition (or, as that is a somewhat obtrusive 
word, let us rather say an embodiment) of a 
temperament, almost of a way of life. Surely 
not a common temperament, and just how 
useful a way of life, at least here in America, 
we shall not now inquire ; but at least it is a 
way that has its own charm and attraction. 
When these essays, or some of them, first ap- 
peared in the " National Observer " they doubt- 
less gave a distinct touch to each issue. Now 
that they are brought together they are best 
read with reference to the whole of which each 
forms a part. Excellent ideas well expressed, 
each in itself, may be readily found ; but the 
combined effect of thought and style is the 
thing really worthy of note. 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



DIVERSE ASPECTS OF SOCIAL, PROBLEMS.* 



Every man who thinks is making some attempt 
to construct an image or a system of human society. 
Some are reducing the product of their mental effort 
to writing, using the analyses of previous writers 
and adding something from personal observation 
and reflection. 

Professor Fairbanks's "Introduction to Sociol- 
ogy " is a very readable text-book, and deserves the 
notice of students of social science. The preface 
contains the caution that it is not the author's expec- 
tation that " the specialist in sociological investiga- 
tion will find much here to advance the knowledge 
of the science." The work is a brief outline of a 
vast field, with suggestion rather than exhaustive 
treatment. Society is defined as a group of men 
who live together in relations more or less perma- 
nent. " Psychology deals with man in society, while 
sociology deals with the psychical life which arises 
when men enter into organic union ; the subject of 
the two sciences is the same, and the difference 
between them is simply a difference of standpoint." 
Sociology does not supplant economics, politics, 
ethics, but lays a foundation for them. Its office is 
twofold : to treat the general structure of society, 
its organs and their functions ; and to deal with the 
laws governing social progress. Society may be 
called an " organism," if we are careful to distin- 
guish between the biological and psychical values 
of the word. Society has a physical basis ; derives 
all its force from the physical world ; is modified by 
race, locality, climate, flora, and fauna. The bond 
which unites men in groups is psychical rather than 
physical, and is due to sentiment and common ac- 
tivities. It is the product of development, rather 
than an original gift. The unity of society is the 
unity of a social mind. Language and thought, 
habit and virtue, are developed only in society. The 
causes of social activity are motives felt by the indi- 
vidual, and these stimuli are original and derived. 
The forms of social activity and the social aggre- 
gates should be classified according to the stimuli.

This gives the basis for a classification of social 
phenomena as economic, social (in a narrow sense), 
political, psychical. The domestic life is, strangely 
enough, classed under the second head, and this 
introduces confusion, since the family is unique in 
having all the elements of social life in elementary 
form. These various forms of social activity are 
treated in detail. The second part of the task is to 
trace the laws of social progress and development. 
The life of society is continuous and unified. The 
process of social development is explained in a dis- 
cussion of the phenomena of dispersion and differ- 
entiation, of agglomeration and assimilation. There 
is a tendency to persistence of physical and psy- 
chical characteristics; but modifications and new 
combinations are effected by the contact of races. 
But these processes of development need to be ex- 
plained by their causes. The causes are found in 
the various forces at work in " natural selection." 
Biology reveals the facts of multiplication, variation, 
persistence of type, and survival of the fittest. These 
forces are modified by sexual selection, gregarious 
and family instincts, so that contest is rather between 
groups than between individuals. In the case of man, 
the struggle is modified by the organization of the 
group, by the territorial extension of communication 
and competition, and by the development of reason. 
But struggle never ceases at any stage, and it is the 
condition of progress. The student of contemporary 
society will not find in this " Introduction " direc- 
tions for discipline in direct and personal observa- 
tion of social phenomena. He will be encouraged 
to believe that the sources of knowledge are books, 
and he will find an excellent selected list for his 
reading. At the same time the work will be found 
helpful in the early stages of study and suggestive 
to advanced students. 

Mr. W. H. Mallock is always readable and inter- 
esting. He has a delightful way of presenting the 
optimistic view of the economic situation of our age. 
In his work on " Classes and Masses " one is borne 
along on a placid stream of the " natural working 
of economic forces," without a wave of trouble to 
disturb his peace in this best possible world. The 
ingenious gentleman has a deft way of ignoring the 
fearful struggle through which the working people 
of England have passed to gain what they have 
gained, and of leaving on all minds the impression 
that the only function of a social student is to sit far 
above the roar of the multitude and philosophize 
about the inevitable tendency of wise investments 
to make the wage-earners wealthy if not happy. 
His account of the rise of wages, decrease of pau- 
perism, and cheapening of the necessities of life, is 
the popular and picturesque form of the discoveries 
of Giffin, Levi, and other statistical authorities. It 
is the truth but not by any means the whole truth. 

If Mr. Mallock's book should produce in opti- 
mistic minds a feeling of profound contentment with 
our industrial and political institutions, a wakening 
spur may be found in the book called " King Mam- 
mon." About all that has been said by revolu- 



tionists against the " capitalistic regime " is stated 
or hinted in the turgid pages of this volume. The 
chief cause of our social evils is found in the right 
to make a bequest. Estates should be divided by 
probate courts. There are too many words for the 
argument. 

Students of social movements need to keep in 
close and constant touch with the views of working- 
men in regard to their own industries. In Mr. 
Gallon's collection of essays on " Workers and their 
Industries," we hear the wage-workers speak for 
themselves and in their own industrial dialect. The 
editor calls attention, in his preface, to certain ideas 
which frequently recur in the various discussions, 
" the tendency of our present industrial system to 
produce a steady divorce of the worker from any- 
thing like a complete knowledge of the trade." But 
they also recognize the fact that this specialization 
will help to secure larger leisure and income. There 
seems to be an agreement that apprentices should be 
admitted in limited numbers and under more strict 
regulations, and that legislative protection and con- 
trol should be extended. Technical processes are 
somewhat minutely described, in order to indicate 
their influence upon the health, wages, and char- 
acter of the wage-earners. 

In 1851, Karl Marx wrote a series of letters for 
the " New York Tribune," giving his explanation of 
the European crisis of 1848. He was then living 
in England, in poverty and exile. The letters now 
appear in book form, with the title " Revolution and 
Counter-Revolution." They are fine examples of 
the biting sarcasm, trenchant style, and keen though 
partial insight into the meaning of events, which 
characterized the great socialist. His explanation 
of historic events by tracing them to economic needs 
and changes is in accordance with his general phi- 
losophy of history Hegelianism turned upside 
down. The author's personal share in the agitation, 
and his editorial experience, give the book much of 
the value of a contemporary recital. 

To a citizen of the North who desires to under- 
stand the social conditions that led up to our Civil 
War the book entitled " Southern Sidelights," by 
Mr. Edward Ingle, will furnish valuable materials. 
The treatment is fragmentary, but it has a compre- 
hensive basis, and original sources are used for the 
materials of all chapters. The topics discussed are 
full of interest : traits of the people, phases of indus- 
try, education, literature, plans for progress, slavery 
and the crisis. The statistical materials are ar- 
ranged with reference to proof and instruction, and 
they could not easily be found elsewhere in accessi- 
ble form. Twenty pages of tables fill the valuable 
appendix. The tone of the book is judicial, and the 
argument will help to correct the provincial and 
sectional prejudices which hinder the moral union 
of North and South. 

In connection with Mr. Ingle's book, one may 
well read " Race Traits and Tendencies of the 
American Negro," by Mr. F. L. Hoffman. The 
revelations of this treatise are truly discouraging.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



The author appears to consider philanthropic efforts 
to establish schools and churches among the negroes 
as a positive injury to them. He shows that, on 
the whole, there has been a great increase of pau- 
perism, crime, and sexual immorality among the 
freedmen, parallel with the growth of churches and 
schools. But the author himself suggests that we 
can accept his facts without taking his conclusions. 
May it not be that a different method of education 
and a more ethical religious teaching might have 
shown different results ? It is hard to believe that 
free schools and churches are good for whites but 
destructive to blacks. The author himself shows 
that his only hope lies in preaching, since each chap- 
ter closes with a pungent sermon on domestic mor- 
ality and thrift. He seems to have made too little 
of the political blunder of making a gift of suffrage 
instead of offering it as a prize ; of the reaction 
from absolute dependence under slavery to sudden 
liberty without a period of preparation and proba- 
tion. Thus we may account for the phenomena of 
degradation very easily without impeaching the only 
agencies which have prevented a much worse con- 
dition of immorality. At the same time, mission- 
aries and teachers and philanthropists are under 
obligations to soberly consider the reasonings of this 
depressing and pathetic recital of disappointment 
and temporary defeat. We have much to learn as 
to the best methods of dealing with defective classes. 

Dr. Lyman Abbott has a wide and expectant au- 
dience. His new book, entitled " Christianity and 
Social Problems," presents a collection of various 
articles and sermons that have previously appeared 
separately ; discourses on the social ideals of Chris- 
tianity, with applications to domestic, industrial, 
international, and penological problems. The dis- 
cussion is stimulating, and good use is made of excel- 
lent authorities. The quotation of the census figures 
on crime-increase (p. 299) should have been accom- 
panied by Dr. Wines's protest against their value. 

It was well worth while to print in one volume 
the addresses delivered before the American Con- 
ference on International Arbitration. The most 
essential elements of the question are discussed by 
such eminent men as Mr. Carl Schurz, Mr. Edward 
Atkinson, President Angell, and other specialists in 
international law and political ethics. Minor differ- 
ences are expressed with frankness by men who 
agree on the main issue, the determination of inter- 
national disputes by judicial process rather than by 
the brute force of war. The documents in the ap- 
pendix, arranged by Professor J. B. Moore, are very 
valuable. 

" Immigration Fallacies " deals with the evils of 
too rapid invasion of European immigrants. The 
arguments are based on the observations of an intel- 
ligent reader of current events, rather than upon 
exhaustive statistical analyses. A good point is made 
in the chapter on European responsibility for crimes 
committed by foreigners in this country. The treat- 
ment is too brief to be exhaustive.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The story of Publishers and authors, as well as 

the American the reading public, are gradually he- 
mine and miner. com i ng aware that the history of the 

American people does not altogether lie in lists of 
wars, of battles, and of statesmen, nor between the 
lids of the " Congressional Record," but that the 
attrition of concurrent streams of races, inventive 
genius under the stimulus of new surroundings, the 
evolution of means of transportation, and the devel- 
opment of material resources, must be studied and 
their facts recorded. These will be found to under- 
lie much that has been accepted as the sum total of 
American history. Such investigation is especially 
necessary and timely in that rapidly shifting pano- 
rama commonly known as " the West." The types 
developed in the progress of civilization across the 
continent are fast disappearing, but it is some con- 
solation to know that they are to be preserved in 
print in "The Story of the West Series," planned 
for this purpose under the capable editorship of Mr. 
Ripley Hitchcock, and published by Messrs. D. 
Appleton & Co. The initial volume of the series 
was devoted to " The Story of the American In- 
dian," and the second is given to " The Story of 
the Mine." The important duty of telling " The 
Story of the Mine " was entrusted to the competent 
hands of Mr. Charles Howard Shinn, and he has 
told it in precisely the manner which his prior ex- 
cellent writings upon Western topics would prom- 
ise. Confronted by the vast amount of material 
before him, he wisely confined himself in the main 
to the story of the typical Comstock Lode of Ne- 
vada, with side chapters on mine litigation, the min- 
ing community, stock speculation, and mining prob- 
lems with their mechanical solutions. The concluding 
chapters on mining and the miner of to-day con- 
tinue the interest of the story to the present time. 
Readers hitherto have lacked neither statistics of 
mines and mining, nor technical descriptions of ma- 
chinery employed ; neither has there been wanting 
a portraiture of mining camp-life by American au- 
thors. But Mr. Shinn has drawn equally from all 
sources, and has produced a new alloy upon which 
he has stamped the picturesque images of the pros- 
pector, the exploiteur, the miner, the speculator, the 
parvenue millionaire, and the camp-follower. He 
chooses to err on the side of the romantic rather 
than the technical ; to intersperse his facts with 
glimpses of the life which gave rise to the facts ; to 
toss out his English in bits of native metal, instead 
of fastidiously arranging his sentences in regular 
piles of bullion bars. But the style is felt to be 
suited to the rugged life it portrays. The interested 
reader joins the mad crowd in one of the many 
" rushes " for a new field ; he studies the " indica- 
tions " of the Let-Her-Rip," the " Last Chance," 
or the " Gouge-Eye "; he mutters his imprecations 
at the demand of the broker for " more mud," and 
he goes " Bonanza " or " Borrusca," as his luck 
may be. The book will appeal to readers who have

seen something of the regions or the life it so viv- 
idly portrays, as well as to those who seek clear 
information concerning the most important factor 
in the development of the Western half of the great 
American continent. 

In Professor W. H. Hudson's " Stud- 
The interpretation j eg in Interpretation " (Putnam) , the 

of literature. , \ \ " 

student of literature will find as good 
criticism as has appeared, in America at least, for 
some time. The essays will be most interesting to 
those who really desire to know something about 
Keats, Clough, Matthew Arnold ; as to how they 
will impress others, there may be doubt. But al- 
though thoughtful, they are not scholastic in char- 
acter, and, we should think, would appeal to a con- 
siderable audience. We consider the results sound 
and well put : the essay on Keats will probably be 
more useful in helping one to Keats's poetry than 
anything else published ; Clough needs no introduc- 
tion to some of his work and no introduction can 
revive the rest, so that the estimate of Clough is 
more for general reading ; the essay on Matthew 
Arnold will be of value to the reader of his poetry 
and prose alike. We approve of all the book but 
the title, and as the title is carefully chosen, and 
seems from the preface to be representative of 
the author, we see that we differ from him. These 
essays " are intended to be, within the strict mean- 
ing of the title chosen for them, studies in inter- 
pretation." Interpretation of what? is the question. 
If Professor Hudson thinks he is interpreting the 
poetry of these poets, we conceive him to be wrong. 
If he means thas he is interpreting the characters of 
the poets, he is right, except that " to interpret a 
character " is not a common use of language. To 
interpret is to give the hidden meaning of any ex- 
pression. Now a character is hardly an expression ; 
a poem is an expression, but not a poet. So one 
may interpret a poem, but a poet is not, strictly 
speaking, to be interpreted. It must further be re- 
marked that to present the character of a poet is 
not to interpret his poetry ; it only furnishes bases 
for interpretation. The character, or more accu- 
rately the spirit, of the poet is not the poem, and to 
analyze the spirit of the poet is not to interpret the 
poem. These essays are on the men, not on their 
works. Doubtless, however, Professor Hudson had 
all this in mind ; he puzzles us a little by saying 
that his point of view is not commonly adopted by 
students of modern poetry. Now we should say that 
the error of confusing an analysis of a poet's char- 
acter with an interpretation of his work was the com- 
monest error alive to-day in the academic teaching 
of English literature. It is then probable that the 
difference between Professor Hudson's standpoint 
and that not so uncommon at present is that he 
knows what he is doing, while the others do not. 
Read with an understanding of their true bearing, 
these essays will be found admirable. The one on 
Keats, as we have said, we think the best. We re- 
gret that Professor Hudson was unwilling to specu- 



late farther upon what Keats might have become, 
or rather that he did not bring out an element of 
the poet's life and poetry which never came to com- 
plete development, through his early death. We 
think it needed to give an adequate view of the poet. 
But, as it is, the leading points are picked out with 
great skill and are well presented. 

M. Gaston Boissier is so delightful a 
An unwelcome wr it er that a good translation of any 

translation. P , , , , . , , 

of his works would certainly find a 
welcome among English readers. But that does not 
mean that the translation of " Rome and Pompeii," 
now before us, will find a welcome. The readers 
of such a volume are naturally persons of more or 
less classical culture, and such persons cannot enjoy 
a translation honeycombed with errors at the very 
points where classical culture should make itself 
manifest. One reaches but the fifth page to find 
the Via Nomentana disguised as Nomentata ; the 
ninth (and many others) transfers the French form 
Denys into English for Dionysius of Halicarnassus ; 
and in like manner we find Sllves for Silvse, Dios- 
cures for Dioscuri, Pastes for Fasti, Celse for Cel- 
sus, Pollion for Pollio, and Aulu Gelle for Aulus 
Gellius. Another numerous group of errors is rep- 
resented by Claudienus for Claudianus, Pomporius 
for Pomponius, Catullus for Catulus, Frono for 
Fronto, and even Haceus for Flaccus. Padre 
Bruzzi, Padre Bruzza, and Father Bruzza are 
different designations for the same individual. The 
great rival of Cicero appears as the poet Hortensius, 
and the Phsedrus of Plato as the Phcedra. The 
reader may have his choice between St. Maria Mag- 
giore and St. Santa Maria Maggiore. Turtullian, 
the Pathagoricians, and the son of Atrseus form a 
fine group for an intelligent man to contemplate ; 
and but why go any farther? We are almost 
ready to recommend this as a supplement to the 
many " Do n't " books placed on the market within 
the last few years. It is extremely unfortunate that 
M. Boissier should have such a blundering introduc- 
tion to the English and American reader. The book 
bears the imprint of the Putnam press, and Mr. D. 
Havelock Fisher is the translator. In the novel that 
is read to-day and forgotten to-morrow, the ignorant 
translator may be tolerated ; but when he lays his 
hands upon a work of scholarship, it is time for an 
indignant protest. _ . 

Mr. Joseph Edgar Chamberlin's 
u The Listener in the Town " and 
" The Listener in the Country " 
(Copeland & Day) are additions to the number of 
bindings now in existence, but not to the number of 
books. The contents, little essays and bits of obser- 
vation, were well enough as newspaper literature 
(they originally appeared in the " Boston Tran- 
script "), but they do not make real literature. Not 
that there is no merit in the contents ; there is a 
good deal that shows sympathy with the varied forms 
of city life and true affection for the charms of the

country. But it is all very commonplace ; there is 
hardly a spark of individuality. The truth is that 
this generation has been so trained that by this time 
one person out of every ten has fallen into the habit 
of observing a city crowd with the desire to find 
something that will appeal to the heart, or of roam- 
ing about in any half-countrified spot with true de- 
light in the song of birds or the silence of the trees. 
So the reader of Mr. Chamberlin's book will read 
sentence after sentence and say, " Well, I could have 
said that myself if I 'd wanted to." With real books 
on nature say by Gilbert White or Jeffries, by 
Thoreau or Burroughs one never feels in that 
way, because almost every sentence has something 
new and fine in it, and gives that feeling of libera- 
tion of spirit that genius can somehow manage to 
effect. So with real books of sympathetic observa- 
tion of men and things : the list is not so easy to 
make, but we might say books by Charles Lamb, or 
Thackeray, or George William Curtis. We do not 
think we could ourselves say such things as they say, 
because we know we could not. Every sentence we 
enjoy, because it is of a higher power, which for a 
moment we appropriate. Mr. Chamberlin's obser- 
vations we acknowledge for the instant, and then 
forget, just as we forget the thousand-and-one obser- 
vations we make ourselves between morning and 
night, because there is no reason why we should 
remember them. Such work appears in large 
quantities in the papers nowadays, and that is well 
enough, for so many persons read the papers who 
know no better literature ; the real power of litera- 
ture filters down to them through such columns as 
" The Listener " in " The Transcript." But there 
is no reason for republishing such articles, unless 
the author will confine them to his friends. From 
the above strictures must be excepted the three 
papers on Mountains. Mountains have apparently 
the power to sting Mr. Chamberlin into moments of 
genuine and individual expression ; they get his key- 
note. 

There is a game which grown-up peo- 
Haecfabuia le Some ti m e 8 play with children, 

non docet. . i i . 

called " pictorial proverbs, in which 

each person presents a well-known proverb in the 
form of a picture. The object of the game is to guess 
the proverb that each picture ostensibly illustrates. 
The pictures are often such that the proverb is ob- 
scured rather than illustrated ; but however difficult, 
the guessing is rendered more easy by the fact that 
the moral truth indicated by each picture is usually 
well-known. Those who have suffered under this 
game can imagine what a torment it might become, 
if one were allowed to illustrate any moral idea that 
occurred to him. The pictures would then become 
enigmas, and the offence given by not probing the 
intention of the youthful artists would render one's 
efforts doubly painful. Like this game is the vol- 
ume of Stevenson's " Fables " just published (Scrib- 
ner). We want to like everything Stevenson has 
written ; and, indeed, we feel that we ought to do so. 



But it is sometimes amazingly difficult to see the 
moral implied in these strange tales of his. They 
are generally interesting in themselves ; the inci- 
dents are conceived with the ingenuity of the story- 
teller, the figures are created by a true imagination, 
for instance, the phantom which gobbled at the 
boy like a turkey, and on being struck down gave 
up its life as a little bloodless white thing, is very 
fine in its way, as is also the crone on the dreary 
beach who danced widdershins in the dusk. But as 
to the meaning . It should be remarked, how- 
ever, that a number of the fables are simple enough 
in expression and symbolism. We have generally 
regarded such simplicity as characteristic of the 
fable as a literary form. Stevenson, however, took 
the term in an extended meaning ; a number of 
his longer fables are more what one would incline 
to call allegories or allegorical tales. As to these, 
one is likely to feel like the Earl in the nineteenth 
fable, who said, " There is no sense in any of this, 
and I must be growing old." Still, although enig- 
matic, these fables have a fascination; one reads 
them willingly a second time. Finally, one begins 
to construct from them a theory of life, and to won- 
der whether it were Stevenson's. To distil such a 
theory and offer it to the public is the true duty of 
the critic of this book. This he should do, and not 
merely gird at his author for alleged obscurity. 

The study of literature as a criticism 
of life would seem to demand some 
analysis of literature in general on 
the basis of the facts of life. We ought to have lit- 
erature considered according to the necessities of a 
historical or a biographical or a rhetorical stand- 
point, and also from the standpoint of one who be- 
lieves that in literature he will come to an under- 
standing, or at least a criticism, of life as it really is. 
Unable, however, to grasp the whole matter at once, 
he asks some arrangements that may correlate the 
two. Suppose, as Ruskin suggests, we ask for Shake- 
speare's opinion on the matter of Church authority. 
How are we to get it? Looking at literature from 
the standpoint of life, we do not care particularly 
for history, biography, rhetoric, and their divisions 
are not to our purpose. We know of certain ele- 
ments of life, certain facts or questions of life, and 
to such system as we may have of these facts or 
elements we want to accommodate our gain from 
literature. Some such ideas as these serve to show 
how " The Vision of Christ in the Poets " (edited 
by Mr. C. M. Stuart and published by Messrs. Curts 
& Jennings) has a value beyond other collections of 
religious poetry. Christ is a great fact in life. Has 
literature anything to say whereby we shall realise 
that fact the better ? The book in question is not a 
study nor a treatise ; indeed, it falls short in many 
particulars of what it might be ; but there is so little 
else of the sort that many people will like to see it. 
It is made up of extracts from eight poets of our 
own century, and also from Milton, with some slight 
comment and explanation.

Dr. C. C. Abbott's recent volume of 
Pleasant talks "Bird-Land Echoes" (Lippincott) 

about birds. 

adds to the author s repute as a ten- 
der lover of nature and a vivid narrator of his ex- 
periences in his studies of animal life in the woods 
and fields. His discourse is like the free, frank, 
informal talk held by the camp-fire or the glowing 
hearth at evening-time, when the day's work is done 
and there is leisure for idle and happy reminiscence. 
Still, there is method in his " Bird-Land Echoes," 
each separate chapter treating of some special group 
of birds, the members of which follow each other 
in a sort of haphazard order as they chance to come 
before the mental vision, or as they would chance 
to appear in an actual walk amid their native haunts. 
One feels in reading the book as though in the very 
presence of the author, who in an amiably voluble 
mood speaks of all the trifling occurrences connected 
with his theme, giving now an interesting fact that 
is worth treasuring, and now a mere opinion or ex- 
pression of feeling uttered in emphatic words that 
are striking and amusing. One is grateful for the 
frequent outbursts of indignation at the slaughter of 
our birds for the decoration of women's hats and 
the gratification of the hunter. We cannot boast of 
our civilization, our humanity even, until we learn 
to respect the life of the meanest thing that breathes. 
The illustrations enlivening Dr. Abbott's book are 
evidently copies of stuffed birds, and are not always 
as true to life as they should be. Most of the bird- 
figures are puffed out in the breast in a sadly un- 
natural way. 

Mr. Thomas S. Blair, author of the

(William R. Jenkins) starts out to discover a work- 
ing hypothesis which shall rightly answer the ques- 
tion, What can man do to further man's progress ? 
and finding that the methods of the philosopher have 
proved inadequate, he adopts, experimentally, the 
methods of the business-man. He informs the reader 
at the outset that there is no attempt in his work 
to present a dogmatic exposition of positive doc- 
trine, but that every statement is to be understood 
as hypothetical only. He proceeds on certain as- 
sumed facts which are satisfactory to himself, and 
works out a system of prescripts of national policy 
which he believes will add to the sum of human 
progress and prosperity. His methods of reasoning 
are almost too involved and obscure to attract the 
interest of the average reader, and it is hence doubt- 
ful if he succeeds in arousing that action which his 
thought and evident sincerity ought to awaken.

Dr. David Starr Jordan reproduces his volume of 
" Science Sketches " (McClurg), having replaced some 
of the rods of the fascia with sticks of a later gathering. 
Whether he describes the life of a salmon or a " johnny 
darter," or shows how trout understand multiplication 



and division, and how they have flanked the unscalable 
precipices of the Great Divide, explains the deep-set 
furnaces that keep the Yellowstone gushers in hot water, 
or tells how he marched up the peak of the Matterhorn 
and then marched down again, defends the idiosyncracies 
of Rafinesque or pays devout homage to Agassiz, or 
presents an allegoric vision of the monstrosities of pro- 
tection as discovered from an ideal and isolated point 
of view, Dr. Jordan is always original and instructive, 
and sometimes he is amusing as well. 

A monograph upon the White Pine, Pinus Strobus, 
the most important lumber - producing tree of North 
America, by Gifford Pinchott and Harry S. Graves, 
treats the subject upon its economic side in a method at 
once complete and concise. It discusses the conditions 
under which the tree thrives, the evils which threaten 
it, the prospect of its reproduction upon suitable areas; 
and shows by tables and diagrams, condensed from a 
multitude of observations, the amounts of merchantable 
material, either squared timber or sawn lumber, which 
may be secured from single trees or from measured 
areas of land, with the rates of increase at different 
stages in the growth of the forest. (Century Co.). 

" Rosemary and Rue " (Rand, McNally & Co.) is the 
pretty title given to a pretty book of selections from the 
writings of " Amber," the pen-name by which the late 
Mrs. Martha Holden was long known to Chicago news- 
paper readers. Mrs. Holden had a happy knack of 
evolving bits of philosophy or of fun out of the most 
commonplace circumstances or happenings, and, by her 
own confession, " simply adored the open sky, a tree in 
bloom, and a pretty woman." A wise discrimination has 
been exercised in making these selections; some pleasant 
and graceful verses are scattered among the prose ; and 
there is a brief preface by Mr. Opie Read. 

The " Oxford Teacher's Bible," published at the Uni- 
versity Press by Mr. Henry Frowde, is a triumph of 
compact and beautiful book-making. Printed upon the 
famous Oxford India paper, it gives us within the com- 
pass of a single octavo volume of moderate size some- 
thing like two thousand pages of text and plates. Three 
distinct works are here bound together: the Scriptures 
themselves, " Bible Illustrations," and " Helps to the 
Study of the Bible." The " Illustrations " are a series 
of plates illustrating Biblical versions and antiquities, 
while the " Helps " comprise summaries, notes, tables, 
indexes, a concordance, and a set of maps. The text is 
that of the authorized version, with frequent reference 
to the revised version completed in 1885. The whole 
is bound in flexible morocco, and makes up a volume so 
nearly perfect in every way that it would be difficult 
to suggest improvements. Another remarkable book 
made possible by the use of the India paper is the " Ox- 
ford Byron," a rather thin volume of over nine hun- 
dred double-columned pages, containing the complete 
works of the poet. 

Mr. John W. Tufts is the author of " A Handbook of 
Vocal Music " for use in the public schools, although 
designed for teachers rather than for pupils. The work 
is the outcome of many years of pedagogic experience, 
and is very completely adapted for its avowed purpose. 
The claim is not too great that " it will give teachers 
who are obliged to work without supervision much of 
the inspiration and help that they must otherwise lack." 
We may also mention in this connection Mr. C. W. 
Johnson's " Songs of the Nation," a collection of pa- 
triotic, occasional, college, and devotional songs. Both 
books are published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett, & Co.

Till thine own song its inmost soul expressed 

Of peace unstirred by struggle or unrest, 

Were there no hours when to thy noon's hot gleams 
Came back the joy of morn's enchanted beams, 

Ere thy great heart began its weary quest ? 

Haunted through all the arches of the wood 
By shapes of woe and cries of human pain, 
Faces that followed, hands too weak to cling, 

Hast thou not waked at last and found it good 
To see no shadows on the glittering plain, 
And once again be glad of everything ? 

EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER. 



THE SILENT SINGER. 



" Dreamer of dreams," absorbed in loveliness, 
Without thy voice it is an " empty day " ; 
Thou " idle singer," whose serene, sweet lay 
Beguiled the soul when others wrought distress; 
" Born out of thy due time " thy song no less 

Hath marked thy journey, as the flowers of May 
Tell us that Spring hath passed adown our way 
And whispered, hand to lips, " Confess! confess! " 
Seeking thine own, thy soul hath travelled far; 
Yet vain for thee an " Earthly Paradise " 

As Jason's journey for the Golden Fleece. 
Now thou hast gone unto another star, 
To greet thy kindred in eternal skies 

To share in Chaucer's and Boccaccio's peace. 
WILLIAM S. LORD. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Translations of " Brude-Slaatten " and " En Dag " are 
given in the latest volume of the edition of Herr Bjorn- 
son's novels now in course of publication by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

The Funk & Wagnalls Company have published the 
second volume of " The Reader's Shakespeare," pre- 
pared for " elocutionists " and public readers by Mr. 
David Charles Bell. 

" A Little Tour in Ireland," probably the most famous 
of Dean Hole's books, with the original drawings made 
by John Leech, is published in a new edition (the third) 
by Mr. Edward Arnold. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a new edition (the 
third), revised and enlarged by Dr. Elwyn Waller, of 
the " Manual of Quantitative Chemical Analysis," writ- 
ten by the late Frederick A. Cairns. 

The Student's Lyell," edited by Mr. John W. Judd, 
and brought fully up to date, is published by Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers in their well-known " Student's 
Series " of school and college text-books. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mii'Hin & Co. publish a complete 
one-volume edition, appropriately named the " Apple- 
dore," of " The Poems of Celia Thaxter." The poems 
are arranged in the order of their original publication. 



The second volume of " History, Prophecy, and the 
Monuments; or, Israel and the Nations," by Dr. James 
F. McCurdy, has just been published by the Macmillan 
Co. This volume carries on the work to the fall of 
Niniveh. 

Volume III. of "The Intermediate Text-Book of 
English History," by Mr. C. S. Fearenside, covers the 
period from 1603 to 1714, and is published by Messrs. 
Hinds & Noble, the New York agents for " The Uni- 
versity Tutorial Series." 

A popular edition of Professor Villari's " Life and 
Times of Girolamo Savonarola," translated by Mrs. 
Linda Villari, is imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. The work is contained in a single volume of 
nearly eight hundred pages. 

" Beatrix," translated by Mr. James Waring, has just 
been added to the Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac. 
The same publishers have also issued " Venus and 
Adonis " and " The Rape of Lucrece," as two volumes 
of the " Temple " Shakespeare. 

Professor F. Max Miiller's centennial translation of 
Kant's " Critique of Pure Reason," first printed in En- 
glish fifteen years ago, has been reissued by the Mac- 
millan Co. in a handsome single-volume edition of over 
eight hundred pages, and at a moderate price. 

The first number of Mr. W. Dawson Johnston's 
" English Historical Reprints " is out, and includes docu- 
mentary texts on " The Relations between Church and 
State " in the mediseval period. A misprint on the title- 
page gives the date 154 where 1540 is intended. 

The Round Robin Reading Club, " designed for the 
promotion of systematic study of literature," has issued 
a neat pamphlet giving details of the plan and work of 
the organization. Copies may be had by addressing 
Miss Louise Stockton, Director, 4213 Chester Avenue, 
Philadelphia. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. are to publish the 
" American Citizen " series, under the editorship of Pro- 
fessor A. B. Hart. Among the titles announced are 
these: "Financial History of the United States," by 
Professor D. R. Dewey; "American Foreign Policy," 
by Professor J. B. Moore; and " Actual Government, as 
Applied under American Conditions," by the editor of 
the series. 

"The Devil's Pool "and "Francois the Waif "are 
among the most charming of George Sand's works, and 
need no word of comment at this late day. Exception- 
ally good translations of these books, made by Miss 
Jane Minot Sedgwick and Mr. Ellery Sedgwick, and 
published in exceptionally tasteful editions by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co., are before us. Curiously enough, 
the same etching serves as a frontispiece for both vol- 
umes. 

A prize of 50, to be called the " Welby Prize," is 
offered for the best treatise upon " The causes of the 
present obscurity and confusion in psychological and 
philosophical terminology, and the directions in which 
we may hope for efficient practical remedy." Compe- 
tition is open to those who, previously to October 1, 
1896, have passed the examinations qualifying for a 
degree at some European or American University, and 
the essays must be sent in within a year from that date. 
They may be written in English, French, or German, 
and must contain at least 25,000 words. Further de- 
tails may be obtained of Prof. E. B. Titchener of Cor- 
nell University, who is to receive and forward manu- 
scripts from the United States.

THE FINAL WAR. 

An Historical Romance of the Near Future. By Louis 
TRACY. With 16 full-page Illustrations. Large 12mo, $2.00. 
" The clever historian of ' The Final War ' has described, with his- 
toric fidelity and with no little dramatic force, certain very important 
international complications which are to occur towards the close of the 
present century. Jealousy of Great Britain has united for the moment 
certain of the other great powers in a scheme for the dismemberment 
of the British Empire. The United States, taking the ground that this 
scheme constitutes a crime against civilization, joins hands with Great 
Britain. The result of a war so general as to be nearly universal is to 
lay an assured foundation for a final peace among the nations of the 
world." 

AMERICAN ORATIONS. 

From the Colonial Period to the Present Time, selected as

By the late Rev. JOHN OWEN, author of "Skeptics of the 
French Renaissance," "Skeptics of the Italian Renais- 
sance," etc. 12mo, net, $3.00. 

CONTENTS: Job. Prometheus Bound. Hamlet. Magico 
Prodigioso ( Calderon ) . Faust. 

" A brief reflection may serve to suggest that these dramas, starting 
from the same standpoint, and resembling each other's plot and evolu- 
tion so closely, must needs possess matter of exceeding interest for all 
thinkers and schools of thought. First, they prove that the problems 
and difficulties with which men have coped through all time are essen- 
tially the same Prometheus in opposition to the Olympian Deities ; the 
Patriarch Job in antagonism to the Hebrew Jahve; Faust and the 
wonder-working magician contending with the Deity of the modern 
world, and with the laws by which he endeavors to rule it all are vin- 
dicators of the self-same issue, protogenists in the self-same battle. 
They occupy the same standpoint of inherent justice and of automatic 
mental independence, of self-determining reasoning and conscience ; 
they commence from the self -same starting point ; they employ largely 
the same arguments; they arrive mostly at the same conclusions."

Vincent; A. M. Palmer, the famous manager, takes Charles II. Thorne, Jr.; and William T. Adams takes Sol Smith Russell. 
The combination of authors and subjects makes a strong theatrical company.

sist in its adoption of the historical method. I know of no grammar in 
English which combines an empirical statement of the facts of the 
present language with such a richness and thoroughness of historical 
illustrations. Other points which appear to me new and advantageous 
are the strictly scientific treatment of the pronunciation and the abun- 
dance of examples, not made out of hand, but taken from actual French 
authors. I shall introduce the book into my classes here." Prof. 
W. P. SHEPARD, of Hamilton College.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 1896. 



" When you are at a loss what to think, when you doubt and hesitate 
and ask yourself what there is left to believe in, I answer : Duty survives 
untarnished in its glory, undiminished in its authority. Though it slay 
me, yet will I trust in it." From Lecture III. 

AN ETHICAlTMOVEMENT. 

A VOLUME OF LECTURES BY 
WALTER L. SHELDON, Lecturer of the Ethical Society of St. Louis. 

i2tno, cloth, $1.75. 

" This Ethical Movement has met the cravings of my religious nature and made up to me for what I had lost. It has 
given me something to live for and believe in. It is to me not a philosophy but a religion." The Author, 



SOME OF THE TOPICS TREATED 

"Ethical Religion" in what ways contrasted with the re- 
ligion of to-day. 

Is the religions spirit on the decline ? How to revive it. 

To what extent does being religious depend on worship or the 
belief in a God ? 

Can the sense of duty be " all sufficient " and be the basis of 
a religion ? 

A definition of religion uniting all the leaders of the past into 
one brotherhood. 

Has Conscience changed? The " old " and the " new " Con- 
science. 

The " Sense of Duty " where it starts from. 

Could there be a Universal Church adapted to everybody ? 

How we can sympathize while not agreeing in our beliefs. 

Why some men hesitate to use the name of the " Deity" or 
to speak of " God." 

Is this hesitation owing to reverence or the absence of rever- 
ence? 

The " ethical " God Does it mean Agnosticism ? 

If a man is hopelessly confused about facts of religions his- 
tory, what " Christ " is left to such a man ? 

The two contrasted aspects in the Christ conception. 

What these aspects could mean to everybody irrespective of 
difference in beliefs. 

The great Stoics and what they most wanted or aspired for. 
Their success and their failure. 

Conflict between the pursuit of happiness and the devotion to 
"ideals." 



IN AN ETHICAL MOVEMENT." 

Does Nature put a " tax " on high conduct ? 

What role does " mystery " play in an ethical religion ? 

The importance of a " sacred literature " for higher culture. 

Is the privilege of immortality an acquired privilege ? 

What kind of poetry most inspires the soul ? 

Why is it that the marriage relationship is so often a partial 
failure ? 

The decline of " romance " in later life its causes. 

Outline for an " ethical " marriage service. 

Is the family destined to survive as an institution ? 

Outline for an " ethical " christening service. 

Can ethics restore the idealism once pertaining to the concep- 
tion of the State ? 

How the doctrine of Evolution has affected the conception of 
"patriotism." 

Can we sympathize with the "reformer" without agreeing 
with his theories ? 

Importance of distinguishing between reforms as theories and 
reforms as symptoms. 

Contrast between Social Ideals and Ethical Ideals. 

Is there a "coming re volution"? " Historic wave-movements." 

Why some people are nearly always in a state of " suspended 
judgment." 

The "theorist" and the "man of affairs." 

The changes which have taken place in the conception of pri- 
vate property. 

On what ethical conditions private property may survive as an 
institution. 



DIVERSE PRESS COMMENTS. 



" If the papers in this volume are at all a fair specimen of 
the sermons we are to get from the new ethical preachers, the 
members of the very catholic Church of the future are to be 
envied. The teaching is clear and vigorously expressed. The 
lecturer is neither a merely ethical speculator, nor an earnest, 
cloudy rhetorician, but a man who, though an idealist, can be 
fervent without abandoning logic and well-defined principles." 

Glasgow Herald. 

" Much that the author says is well worthy of attention even 
from those who do not accept his standpoint nor agree with 
his views." Critic (New York). 

" For the temperance and gentleness of his arguments Mr. 
Sheldon cannot be too highly commended ; they are qualities 
not often met with in ' reformers ' of equally earnest and rad- 
ical views." Literary World (Boston). 

"One of the most striking features to those who view it 
from without is the absolute identity of its aims and conclu- 
sions, though reached by a wholly different road, with those 
of the broader teachings both of Judaism and of Christianity." 

Milwaukee Sentinel. 

"They are interesting lectures. The work done by the 
Ethical Society has been of the greatest value." Pall Mall 
Gazette (London). 

" Anyone who follows the newest developments of the his- 
tory of culture and ^philosophy will find much in it that will 
repay a close attention." Edinburgh Scotsman. 



" The book is one which should have a wide influence. It 
possesses learning and thought and genuine eloquence, and if 
it can be taken as a representative expression of the new ethics, 
its import is something more than optimistic it is inspiring. ' ' 
Boston Beacon. 

" Interesting on account of its sincere and highly intellectual 
treatment of many of our present social problems." New- 
castle Daily Leader (England). 

" Attractively written and instructive. We think we do not 
misrepresent the author if we say that a religious spirit per- 
vades his addresses to such an extent that we may regard him 
as 'almost a Christian.' " Westminster Review. 

" Can hardly fail to be helpful to many readers who seek 
guidance in the strain of every-day living." San Francisco 
Chronicle. 

" The handling of the questions under debate is able and 
skilful. The tone is always calm and candid. The view is 
broad and clear. The suggestions are practical." Boston 
Transcript. 

" The book cannot fail to stimulate thinking readers to high 
and noble living." Public Opinion (New York). 

" It is an important book, or rather ought to be found so by 
pastors and religious teachers, giving them the revelation they 
need of the minds of many earnest, noble-hearted young 
men." The Evangelist (New York).

THE FUTURE OF ENGLISH SPELLING. 

Agitation for a reform of English spelling 
has been going on for a long while, both in 
England and the United States, but the reform- 
ers have received slight encouragement from 
the public. The empirical reconstruction urged 
by Webster has given place to the more scien- 
tific conceptions of modern philology ; but all 
the reformers, men of science and empiricists 
alike, have made no serious breach in the de- 
fences of conservatism. Every form of argu- 
ment, from plea to denunciation, has been en- 
listed in the attack, but the citadel has remained 
impregnable. Even Webster's " Dictionary " 
has grown conservative in its old age, and bears 
but few traces of the fiery radicalism of its 
youth. The little systems of the phonetists 
have had their day, each in its turn arousing 
the public to momentary mirth or wonder, and 
then giving place to another no less grotesque 
and impossible. The legislature of the nation 
and the school authorities of the locality have 
been petitioned and memorialized and appealed 
to in the most frantically misspelled terms, 
and have remained obdurate. The publisher 
here and the editor there, who, impatient of 
delay, have allowed zeal to outrun judgment, 
and have sought to force a reformed spelling 
upon the reluctant public, have had only their 
labor for their pains, and made for themselves 
the old discovery that man is not a logical ani- 
mal. Judging by the almost total failure of 
the English spelling-reformer to accomplish his 
purpose, we may with peculiar fitness apply to 
him the words of the poet : 

" He weaves, and is clothed with derision ; 
Sows, and he shall not reap." 

The net result of all his efforts in the United 
States is summed up in the few Websterian 
forms that have found a lodgment in usage 
(many of these abhorrent to a delicate sense), 
in the adoption of a few other simplified forms 
by scattered publishers, and in the tentative 
admission to some of our later dictionaries of 
an appendix of amended spellings. 

In the face of this persistent opposition to a 
change which has been advocated by so many 
able scholars and supported by so many plaus- 
ible arguments, it is worth while to inquire into 



274 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



the causes of what spelling-reformers have too 
hastily assumed to be mere obstinacy or unrea- 
soning prejudice. The time is past for them 
to say with Professor Lounsbury that " there 
is certainly nothing more contemptible than our 
present spelling, unless it be the reasons usually 
given for clinging to it," or with Professor Whit- 
ney that " it need not be said that the objec- 
tions brought on etymological and literary and 
other grounds against the correction of English 
spelling are the unthinking expressions of igno- 
rance and prejudice." If these statements were 
true, the reformers would have something sub- 
stantial to show for their long-continued efforts, 
and the fact is notorious that they have almost 
nothing to show for them. When we come to 
think of it, the wholesale ascription of " igno- 
rance and prejudice " to the many men who 
have opposed the spelling-mongers is a weapon 
more likely than not to recoil upon those who 
use it as an argument ; while " contemptible " 
is about as ill-fitting an epithet as could be 
found, whether to describe the conservative po- 
sition itself, or the spelling which is the pri- 
mary object of attack. Our English spelling 
may be irrational, and inconsistent, and diffi- 
cult of mastery, but it is just as much a natural 
product as is a tree or a wild animal. One 
may prefer the order and symmetry of a French 
garden to a free woodland growth ; but he who 
has a nice feeling for the meaning of words 
does not call the forest oak contemptible be- 
cause it is gnarled. 

A recent article in " The Forum," by Mr. 
Benjamin E. Smith, the editor of " The Cen- 
tury Dictionary," quotes with seeming approval 
the above dicta of Professors Lounsbury and 
Whitney, but proceeds to discuss the subject 
in a very different spirit. Mr. Smith is a pro- 
nounced advocate of spelling-reform, but he 
reckons with the arguments of his opponents 
instead of brushing them aside as unworthy of 
serious consideration. The conservative could 
ask for no better statement than the following 
of the reason that chiefly influences him in op- 
posing any radical change. This reason is " the 
closely-knit association, in all minds, between the 
form of the printed word, or of the printed page, 
and the spiritual atmosphere which breathes 
through our language and literature. There is 
a deep-rooted feeling that the existing printed 
form is not only a symbol but the most fitting 
symbol of our mother tongue, and that a radical 
change in this symbol must inevitably impair for 
us the beauty and spiritual effectiveness of that 
which it symbolizes. Could the literary spirit 



even of a Shakespeare, we feel, retain for us 
undiminished its delicacy and power if clothed 
in the spelling of the Fonetic Nuz ' ? " The 
feeling thus expressed is akin to that which 
makes us enjoy literature far more in the pages 
of a comely and carefully-studied volume than 
we could enjoy the same work in some cheap 
and tasteless reprint. It is the same sort of 
feeling that heightens for all readers of taste 
the power of literature when it appeals to them 
from the pages of a Conquet edition, or a pub- 
lication of the Grolier Club, or an issue of the 
Kelmscott Press. It is useless to call such feel- 
ings irrational, or to make light of them as 
arguments against a change ; they exist, and 
they exert a controlling influence upon the de- 
cisions of the majority of intelligent readers. 
Those who cannot share them, and allow them 
their full weight in the discussion, are as incom- 
petent to pronounce judgment upon the ques- 
tion of spelling-reform as are the color-blind to 
pronounce upon Venetian painting, or those 
without an ear for music to pass upon the 
achievements of Bach and Beethoven. 

This of course is only one of the reasons for 
which a wholesale change in our spelling is 
opposed by so many earnest thinkers. There 
are other weighty considerations, such as the 
danger of making the great mass of printed 
literature in the least degree difficult of access 
for the average reader ; and the danger of ob- 
scuring etymologies, of which too much has 
doubtless been made, but which remains a real 
danger in spite of the many efforts to minim- 
ize it. We must also remember that the argu- 
ments made in behalf of reform are often 
greatly overstated. We are given the wildest 
estimates of the amount of money that might 
be saved in our printing bills, of the number 
of years that might be saved in the work of 
primary education, of the obstacles that might 
be removed from the path of foreign students 
of our language. All of these arguments have 
weight, but they do not have anything like the 
weight given them by phonetic extremists. Mr. 
Smith, who is not an extremist, discusses the 
whole question with the utmost fairness, admits 
that spelling-reform " has made almost no head- 
way at all," concedes " that the adoption by 
the public of any general, radical, phonetic 
system is one of the most improbable things 
that can be imagined," and declares that the 
only practical thing for the reformers to at- 
tempt is a series of gradual modifications in 
the language stimulating by conscious effort 
the sort of transformation that has been work-

ing itself out instinctively during the past 
three centuries. 

If spelling-reformers in general would adopt 
this moderate position, there would be little 
serious disagreement among thinking men. 
Mr. Horace E. Scudder, speaking of Webster's 
unsuccessful effort to create a new language 
" made in America," justly says : " Language 
is not a toy or a patent machine, which can be 
broken, thrown aside at will, and replaced with 
a better tool, ready-made from the lexicog- 
rapher's shop. He had no conception of the 
enormous weight of the English language and 
literature, when he undertook to shovel it out 
of the path of American civilization. The stars 
in their courses fought against him." It may 
safely be said that English spelling will con- 
tinue to undergo the sort of modification in the 
direction of rationality that has marked its de- 
velopment in the past, and at a probably accel- 
erated rate. And it may be said with equal 
safety that no other sort of change is possible. 
It is our own opinion that no other sort of 
change is, all things considered, desirable, and 
that each simplified spelling proposed must be 
judged upon its own merits, submitting to a test 
in which feeling and instinct are given as much 
weight as logic, before it shall receive perma- 
nent acceptance in our speech. " There are," 
to quote from Mr. Smith once more, " in the 
variations of our existing orthography allowed 
by the dictionaries and in the occasional inno- 
vations of influential writers which are accepted 
by the public without. any jarring of the nerves, 
the beginnings of a movement which, if contin- 
tinued along its own lines and gradually pushed 
to a consistent conclusion, will result in a vast 
simplification and rationalizing of our lan- 
guage." 



ENGLISH LITERATURE IN GERMANY. 



(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
At the moment when the effort is being made to estab- 
lish the teaching of English Literature in American 
universities, it may be of interest to consider the teach- 
ing of the same subject in the German universities, 
where for the last quarter-century or more so many 
American teachers of English have received their train- 
ing and their methods. I have before me the general 
catalogue of the lectures in all the German universities 
for the coming winter semester, which has recently 
been published in Munich. In twenty-eight German 
universities (in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) 
where courses in English philology are given, I find that 
out of a total of ninety-six courses, not including courses 
for beginners in modern English, some twenty-five 
courses, requiring some fifty-six hours per week, are 



exclusively linguistic. Representative titles under this 
head are Professor Wiilker's course at Leipsic on " The 
Historical Grammar of English " and Professor Sar- 
razin's course at Kiel on " The History of the English 
Language." Of courses in Old English there are nine- 
teen requiring thirty-eight hours ; and in Middle English 
(exclusively) there are eight (sixteen hours). Most 
of these are introductory courses, and are also largely 
linguistic. Specimen titles are " Cynewulf 's Elene and 
the Cynewulf Question " (Professor Victor at Mar- 
burg), " Anglo-Saxon Grammar, with Reading of Beo- 
wulf " (Professor Streitberg at Freiburg in Switzerland), 
" Chaucer's Life and Works with Interpretation of the 
Prologue of the Canterbury Tales " (Professor Kolbing 
at Breslau), and " Introduction to the Critical Study of 
Middle English Ballads and Metres " (Professor Brandl 
at Berlin). Nine courses on literary history before 
Shakespeare are announced (twenty-four hours). Such 
are "The Language and Literature of the Anglo- 
Saxons " (Professor Koeppel at Strassburg), and " The 
History of English Literature from Chaucer to Spen- 
ser " (Professor Schipper at Vienna). Eight will treat 
of Shakespeare generally (fourteen hours), and five will 
study selected plays of Shakespeare (eleven hours) : e. g. 
" Shakespeare's Life and Works " (Professor Traut- 
manu at Bonn), and " Interpretation of Hamlet " (Pro- 
fessor Schick at Munich). There are only four other 
courses on Elizabethan and Seventeenth Century Liter- 
ature (eight hours), comprising the seminar of Professor 
Hoops at Heidelberg on " The English Renaissance," 
Professor Schipper's seminar " The Interpretation of 
Selected Passages from the Fairy Queen," and two 
courses on Milton. In eighteenth and nineteenth cen- 
tury literature there are fourteen courses (twenty-four 
hours). The selection here is somewhat uncertain and 
bizarre, ranging from " The History of English Prose 
Literature in the Eighteenth Century " (Professor Vetter 
at Zurich) and "James Thomson's Life and Works" 
(Professor Fischer at Innsbruck) to such titles as 
" Readings in H. Morley's Of English Literature in 
the Reign of Victoria ' " (Dr. Hechler at Vienna), " The 
Interpretation of Thackeray's Book of Snobs" (Dr. 
Tamson at Gottingen), " The Interpretation of C. Mas- 
sey's In the Struggle of Life ' " (Professor Fischer at 
Innsbruck), and " Shindler's Echo " (Professor Victor at 
Marburg) so the title stands in the Verzeichnissj I 
don't know what it means! Burns has two courses 
and Byron two. Professor Brandl, who has recently 
taken up arms for Byron in the pages of " Cosmopolis," 
makes Byron the starting-point for his treatment of 
nineteenth century literature. Under the head of mis- 
cellaneous, I place two courses on English metrics (Pro- 
fessors Kaluza and Wagner), Professor Vetter's course 
on the English Volkslied, and Professor Victor's " Meth- 
odik des Unterrichts im Englischen." 

Summarizing, accordingly, of courses not exclusively 
linguistic I find that there are twenty-five treating En- 
glish literature before the sixteenth century, sixteen on 
Shakespeare and the Elizabethans, and fourteen on 
eighteenth and nineteenth century authors. Further- 
more, it is to be noticed that while many of the courses 
on linguistics and several of those covering the earlier 
period in literature are of an advanced and highly spe- 
cialized nature, the same can be said of very few of the 
courses on the later periods. The unavoidable inference 
is that the literary study of English literature is but 
little attempted in the German universities. In the last 
few years, however, I am informed, the demand for 



276 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



courses permitting such study, on the part of American 
students in Germany, has in some quarters begun to 
make itself felt. One hears that such-and-such pro- 
fessors do not neglect the literary side of their subjects, 
and that consequently their courses are more and more 
frequented by Americans. 

Doubtless we have still much to learn from German 
culture and methods in the study and appreciation of 
our own literatures, as we have from French. Who can 
say that the insistence of French and German critics in 
time will not force us to revise our obdurate estimate 
of Byron ? In most respects, however, it is plain that 
the forte of German scholarship is in the treatment of 
Old and Middle English. The text-books and the cur- 
rent histories of literature at any given period usually 
reflect the prevailing taste and criticism of the time. 
If we leave aside the case of Byron, is there any last pos- 
sibility that we will ever be brought to accept the current 
German evaluation of modern English authors, as it is 
reflected in their histories of English literature ? The 
last part of Professor Wiilker's new popular " Geschichte 
der Englischen Litteratnr von den Aeltesten Zeiten bis 
zur Gegenwart " has just this month appeared, and I 
turn to his pages to discover his method of treatment 
for the modern period. The apportionment of chapters 
for the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries 
seems to be just and fairly comprehensive. The Eliza- 
bethan period receives five chapters; the period of the 
Civil Wars and the Restoration, two; and the first half 
of the eighteenth century, four. The titles of the re- 
maining chapters are as follows: The Movement against 
the Art -School in Poetry; Walter Scott; The Lake 
School; Thomas Moore; Byron and Shelley; The Age 
of Queen Victoria. Thomas Moore exalted to a sepa- 
rate chapter, while Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey 
are collectively hidden under the traditional appellation 
of " The Lake School " ! I find the same lack of literary 
perspective exemplified in a representative university 
reference book in the same field, the " Grundriss der 
Geschichte der Englischen Litteratur" by Dr. Gustav 
Korting, professor at Kiel. In this work eleven pages 
are devoted to Byron, four to Moore, and three to 
Wordsworth ! The sesthetic judgments are generally 
to match. I quote from Professor Korting's pages: 
" The greatest of the three poets [of the Lake School] 
is the highly talented Coleridge; Wordsworth and 
Southey never rose above a respectable mediocrity." 
"In England Wordsworth is more favorably judged. 
The reason for this in some measure may be that Words- 
worth through his excellences as through his defects is 
in the highest degree a poet comprehensible to all, and, 
more than this, a poet who has had the peculiar gift, as 
few others have had, of giving expression to specifically 
English thoughts and feelings." " It may be asserted 
[of Moore's lyrics] that they are the noblest productions 
of the modern English Art-lyric." " A poet may pos- 
sess all the qualities which grace the verse of Tennyson, 
and still be a poet of only the second or third rank. 
Tennyson is one of the most attractive of poets, but he 
is not a great poet. He lacks originality and genius. 
The form of his poetry ... is much more significant 
than its contents, which for the most part does not rise 
above mediocrity, and frequently not even above triv- 
iality, using the last word in its best sense. Tennyson's 
poems, if written in prose, would be void of every attrac- 
tion; it was with good reason that he never made use 
of prose " ! 

It is hardly from the negative that our help will come, 



and it seems as though the attitude of academic Ger- 
many towards modern English literature were negative 
and scholastic rather than interpretative and illumina- 
tive. FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

A MISPLACED "BEER KEG." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Let me call attention to an amusing error made by 
the reviewer of " Colonial Days in Old New York," in 
the last issue of THE DIAL. Speaking of the cover of 
the book, the reviewer says that it is " decorated with 
suggestive windmill, beaver, and beer keg," Those who 
have pursued Dutch New York history beyond Irving's 
humorous libel know that the design on Mrs. Earle's 
book is a copy of the seal of the City of New York, 
adopted in 1686. The flour industry of New Nether- 
lands and early New York out-rivalled that of the ex- 
portation of furs, and in consequence the arms of the 
windmill, and & flour barrel, were added to the beaver 
on the seal of the. city, as emblems of its industry and 
commerce. It is the flour barrel, and not the beer keg, 
which is most truly " suggestive " of Dutch development 
in this country. C. A. SEIDERS.

BIRD ILLUSTRATIONS FROM LIFE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am truly grateful for the kindly notice of the text 
of my " Birdland Echoes " in your last issue. But in 
justice to Mr. Crane, the illustrator, I must say that the 
strictures on his part of the work are not justified by 
the facts. Instead of the illustrations being " copies of 
stuffed birds," every bird was drawn from life, and after 
long study ; and the appearance of being " puffed out in 
the breast " is really true to nature. The truth is, we 
have too much in mind the trim, smooth-feathered birds 
of the average illustration. Mr. Crane's drawings I 
claim are the best i. e., the most correct black-and- 
white illustrations ever published; so correct, indeed, 
they do not call for color, if used as a means of identify- 
ing any bird in hand. CHARLES C. ABBOTT.

AT HIGH TIDE. 



O shining slaves that must forever bend! 

Accursed waves that must forever strain! 
What power draws thee, drives thee without end, 

Along a pathway beautiful as vain ? 

Did'st thou betray the Goddess Moon above, 
To be imprisoned thus in green unrest ? 

Compelled to follow in enchanted love 

The magic vengeance of her jealous breast! 

Did'st thou once lift thyselves in praise divine, 
To be thus chained to her idolatry, 

Condemned in sight of Heaven still to pine 
In adoration of futility ? 

O shining slaves that must forever bend! 

Accursed waves that must forever strain! 
What power draws thee, drives thee without end, 

Along a pathway beautiful as vain ?

HAMERTON'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.* 



Mr. Hamerton's Autobiography (1834-58) 
fills about one-third of a rather substantial vol- 
ume, and tells the story of the writer's life up 
to his twenty-fourth year. Fortunately, as it 
happens, this year was the date of his marriage ; 
so that Mrs. Hamerton, in the Memoir by which 
she has supplemented her husband's too-brief 
sketch, is enabled to take up the thread of the 
narrative at the point where he dropped it. 
The volume thus forms a complete and contin- 
uous life of a man to whom America owes 
much both of profit and pleasure. We venture 
to say ("with all deference to the fine rhapsodies 
of Mr. Ruskin) that Mr. Hamerton's books 
have done more than those of any other writer 
to spread in this country a taste for sound art 
and an insight into its principles. 

Mr. Hamerton was born at Laneside, near 
Shaw, Lancashire, in 1834. His family on 
both sides seems to have been of the upper 
middle class, with aristocratic connections and 
leanings. Of his father (an attorney in fair 
practice) he says : 

" He had very little to recommend him except a fine 
person, great physical strength, and fifteen quarterings. 
He had a reputation for dissolute habits, was a good 
horseman, an excellent shot, looked very well in a ball- 
room, and these, I believe, were all his advantages, save 
an unhappy faculty for shining in such masculine com- 
pany as he could find in a Lancashire village in the days 
of George IV. Money he had none, except what he 
earned in his profession, at one time rather a good in- 
come." 

Mr. Hamerton's mother died a little over a 
year after her marriage. " Few people," her 
son says, " who have lived in the world have 
left such slight traces." Her loss was a heavy 
blow to her husband, who, despite his rough 
nature and hard-riding hard-drinking procliv- 
ities, loved her devotedly. He thenceforth neg- 
lected his profession, separated himself more 
and more from his social class,, and sank grad- 
ually into a slough of mere village conviviality : 

" He and his friends drank when they were together 
to make society merrier, and when they happened to be 

alone they drank to make solitude endurable 

They dined at mid-day, and had the spirit decanter and 
the tobacco-box on the table instead of desert, frequently 
drinking through the whole afternoon and a long even- 
ing afterwards. In the morning they slaked alcoholic 
thirst with copious draughts of ale."

1858, and a Memoir by his Wife, 1858-1894. With portrait.

Fortunately, our future author and etcher 
was not brought up mainly under the roof of 
this graceless father else he might well have 
lapsed into a mere rustic scapegrace of the 
" Tony Lumpkin " order, or worse. Much of 
his childhood was passed with two maiden 
aunts at Burnley ; and he says, " I could not 
have been better cared for by my own mother 
than by these two excellent ladies." At Burn- 
ley he learned to read English with ease, and 
attended the Grammar School, where he was 
at once " set at Latin " unfortunately, after 
a method so ingeniously difficult and repulsive 
as to breed in him a " horror of everything 
printed in Latin " that was scarcely overcome 
in later years. The Burnley period is followed 
by a dark chapter in Mr. Hamerton's life so 
dark, he says, that the necessity of writing it 
has made him " put off the composition of this 
autobiography year after year." Into the ex- 
tremely painful details of this chapter we need 
not go. Suffice it to say that in 1843 Mr. 
Hamerton, then a sensitive boy of nine years 
or so, was taken to live alone with his father at 
Shaw ; and that while there, during a period of 
six months, he was treated by him with a cruelty 
which it is charitable to ascribe to mental dis- 
order brought on by long addiction to the 
brandy bottle. During this half-year, existence 
was a hell to him ; and his system was fast giv- 
ing way under the constant strain of the alter- 
nate dread of blows and their actual reception, 
and torments even worse than blows, when the 
end came, swift, tragic, yet not wholly unwel- 
come. Mr. Hamerton thus describes it : 

"I awoke one bleak winter's morning about five 
o'clock, and heard the strangest cries proceeding from 
his room. His man-servant had been awakened before 
me and had gone to the room already, where he was 
engaged in a sort of wrestling match with my father, 
who, in the belief that the house was full of enemies, 
was endeavoring to throw himself out of the window. 
Other men had been called for, who speedily arrived, 
and they overpowered him, though even the remnant of 
his mighty strength was such that it took six men to hold 
him on his bed. ... I was not in the room when he 
died, but my aunt took me to see him immediately after, 
and then I received an impression which has lasted to 
the present day." 

The week that preceded the death of the 
elder Hamilton was one of terror for the for- 
lorn and bewildered boy ; but it had a blessed 
interlude that came like a sign and a dawning 
of the brighter time to come. Of this incident 
Mr. Hamerton says : 

" I had been able to get to sleep that night for a short 
time, when a light in the room woke me. The horrible 
life I had been leading for many a day and night had 
produced a great impressionability, and I was particu-

larly afraid of my father in the night-time, so I started 
up in bed with the idea that he was come to beat me, 
when lo! instead of his terrible face, I saw what was 
forme the sweetest and dearest face in the whole world! 
It was his sister Mary, she who had taken my mother's 
place, and whom I loved with a mingled sentiment of 
filial tenderness and gratitude that remained undimin- 
ished in force during all the after years. For the sud- 
denness of revulsion from horror to happiness, there has 
never been a minute in my existence comparable to the 
minute when I realized that she had come." 

In his father's will the sister Mary of the 
foregoing incident was named as Mr. Hamer- 
ton's sole guardian. Her general life-scheme 
for him was the socially irreproachable one 
comprising a Public School, Oxford, the 
Church ; but, says Mr. Hamerton, " there was 
a vis inertice in my total want of social and 
scholastic ambition. In the worldly sense I 
never had any ambition whatever." The idea 
of Rugby or Harrow having been abandoned, 
he was sent, in 1845, to Doncaster School, 
where he spent three half years not unprofit- 
ably, making fair progress in all branches 
(including drawing) save, as we infer from the 
following observation, the classics. 

" The misfortune was that the classics were not taught 
as literature at all, but as exercises in grammar and 
prosody. They were dissected by teachers who were 
simply lecturers on the science of language, and who 
had not large views even about that. Our whole atten- 
tion being directed to the technicalities of the peda- 
gogue, we did not perceive that the classic authors had 
produced poems which, as literature, were not inferior 
to those of our best English poets." 

Blinded thus by those who should have 
known better to the beauties of Homer and 
Virgil, the boy found out for himself the charms 
of the native poets notably Scott, of whom 
he says : " Of all the influences that had sway 
over me in those days and for long afterwards, 
the influence of Scott was by far the strong- 
est." From Doncaster Mr. Hamerton returned 
to Burnley Grammar School. Here he was 
under the care of Dr. Butler (afterwards his 
private tutor), a kindly man guilty of spoiling 
his boys by sparing the rod, but in advance of 
the average Orbilius of his day and class in 
that he heretically " did not think education 
should be confined to the two dead languages, 
but incited the boys to learn French and Ger- 
man, and even chemistry." At Burnley School 
the author etched his first plate " a portrait 
of a Jew with a turban," and " frightfully 
overbitten." 

In 1850 Mr. Hamerton went to live with 
his guardian at Hollins, in the country ; and 
here his natural and life-long taste for gipsey- 
ing and aquatics (to which his readers owe so 



many pleasant passages) was first mildly in- 
dulged. A primitive catamaran launched on 
a Lancashire fish-pond was the first of a long 
series of experiments with that delusive order 
of craft. About this period his love of medise- 
valism, imbibed from Scott, led to the produc- 
tion of a little book (his first printed one) on 
heraldry, which had some sale. Up to this 
point his tastes had been conservative and aris- 
tocratic, and consonant enough with his guard- 
ian's plans as to Oxford and the Church. But 
now there came a change, a revolution which, he 
says, " was the most important intellectual crisis 
of my life, and which deserves a chapter to 
itself." Into the details of this chapter we can 
not go here. As the reader will have surmised, 
the " crisis " was a religious one. At seven- 
teen the thinking, earnest youth found himself 
spiritually at the parting of the ways. Inquiry 
bred doubt, and doubt meant inability to sign 
the Thirty-Nine Articles that is, to conform 
to a then condition precedent to entering Ox- 
ford. This lapse must have been a sad shock 
to the kind guardian, who was orthodox to the 
backbone, and would doubtless herself have 
gone as a rejoicing witness to the stake. Ox- 
ford and the Church abandoned, the choice of 
a calling became necessary though Mr. Ham- 
erton had some means, enough, he says, "to 
enable me, as a bachelor, to live like a gentle- 
man." He at once declared for literature and 
painting. He adds : 

" I have been sometimes represented as an unsuccess- 
ful painter who took to writing because he had failed 
as an artist. It is, of course, easy to state the matter 
so, but the exact truth is that a very moderate success 
in either literature or art would have been equally ac- 
ceptable to me, so that there has been no other failure 
in my life than the usual one of not being able to catch 
two hares at the same time. I decided to try to be a 
painter and to try to be an author, and see what came 
of both attempts." 

Mr. Hamerton's first master in painting was 
Mr. J. P. Pettitt, whom he met at Keswick in 
1852. In the year following he fell under Mr. 
Ruskin's influence, touching which he makes 
the following sound observations : 

" It was a good influence in two ways, first in litera- 
ture, as anything that Mr. Kuskin has to say is sure to 
be well expressed, and after that it was a good influence 
in directing my attention to certain qualities and beau- 
ties in nature; but in art this influence was not merely 
evil, it was disastrous ... it tended directly to en- 
courage the idea that art could be learned from nature, 
and that is an immense mistake. Nature does not teach 
art, or anything resembling it; she only provides mate- 
rials. Art is a product of the human mind, the slow 
growth of centuries. If you reject this and go to nature, 
you have to begin all over again, the objection being 
that one human life is not long enough for that."

THE DIAL

From the foregoing one may fairly infer that 
the writer admitted to himself that he had real- 
ized too late in life the truth that painting is 
at bottom a refined handicraft ; and that high 
mental gifts coupled with the closest study of 
nature are of little avail to the painter unless 
he be a master of the tools and technique of his 
craft. In 1853 Mr. Hamerton began his " new 
London life " as a pupil in the studio of his 
Iveswick friend, Mr. Pettitt. His account of 
this period contains some interesting memories 
of artists and writers Leslie, Constable, Land- 
seer, Doyle, Ruskin, Tennyson, Rogers, Miss 
Marian Evans, and others. At one time he 
had a notion of going to Egypt, as artist- 
traveller. " I mentioned," he says, " this pro- 
ject to Mr. Ruskin, who said that he avoided 
travelling in countries where he could not be 
sure of ordinary comforts, such as a white table- 
cloth and a clean knife and fork ; still, he would 
put up with a great deal of inconvenience to 
be near a mountain." In April, 1854, Mr. 
Hamerton returned to the country ; and, he 
says, " from that day to this I have never lived 
in London, which has probably been a misfor- 
tune to me, both as artist and writer." A trip 
to the Highlands in the same year resulted in 
a little volume entitled " The Isles of Loch 
Awe and other Poems," which appeared the 
day the author came of age, September 10, 
1855. In the autumn of this year Mr. Ham- 
erton made his first trip to Paris, where he met 
his future wife, Mile. Eugenie Gindriez, daugh- 
ter of a gentleman who had been Prefect of the 
Doubs under the second Republic, and who was 
living quietly at Paris, under mild political 
surveillance, under the Empire. The subject 
of marriage, or even of attachment, was not at 
this time broached between the young people. 
Says Mr. Hamerton : 

" I, for my part, left Paris without being aware that 
Mademoiselle Gindriez had anything to do with my 
future destiny; but she, with a woman's perspicacity, 
knew better. She thought it at least probable, if not 
certain, that I should return after long years; she waited 
patiently, and when at last I did return there was no 
need to tell on what errand." 

The marriage took place at Paris in May, 1858. 
On the eventful morning, as Mr. Hamerton 
recalls, there was a garqon of the hotel brushing 
the waxed floor on the landing outside his door. 

" I had a flowered white silk waistcoat on, and the 
man said, ' Monsieur est bien beau ce matin on dirait 
qu'il va aune noce.' I answered: ' Vous avez bien de- 
vine; en effet,je vais a une noce.' It was unnecessary 
to give him further information." 

The pair journeyed at once to their wild High- 



land home on Loch Awe of all strange places 
in the world, Mr. Hamerton admits, surely the 
least suitable for a young Parisienne to be 
brought to. On the day of their arrival the 
Loch was shrouded in a fog so dense that the 
young bride could scarcely believe there was a 
high mountain opposite : nothing was visible 
from Innistrynich but a still, gray, shoreless 
sea. But this first frown of Nature proved no 
symbol of the future. 

With the arrival at Innistrynich Mr. Ham- 
erton's quota of the volume ends and his wife's 
begins. To Mrs. Hamerton's Memoir, which 
is a very charming, frankly written composi- 
tion, we have little space to devote much 
less than the work deserves. It gives a sat- 
isfactory account of Mr. Hamerton's life and 
work after 1858, and is brightened with much 
lively chat as to the writer's own experiences, 
domestic and social, in Scotland and in France. 
Mrs. Hamerton details with much pleasant 
naivete her not altogether cordial reception at 
the hands of her husband's relatives (who were 
a little disappointed at his choosing a wife 
abroad) notably of a certain Aunt Susan 
Hamerton, a Shandean character recalling in a 
way David Copperfield's peppery but excellent 
Aunt Betsy Trot wood. Aunt Susan's hostility 
to the French fell little short of Miss Trot- 
wood's to donkeys ; but she finally melted be- 
fore the grace and amiability of her niece. The 
story of the reconcilement is prettily told : 

" One morning I was gathering strawberries in the 
garden. . . . Aunt Susan came up and offered to help 
me. Never shall I forget the scene when we both rose 
from the strawberry-beds, with our fragrant little bas- 
kets well filled. We turned towards the lake, whose 
soft, hazy glamor matched that of the tender sky; the 
air was still, and there reigned a serene silence, as if a 
single sound might have desecrated the almost religious 
peace of earth and heaven; yet a smothered sob was 
heard as I felt myself caught in a close embrace, my 
head laid upon a heaving bosom, my hair moist with 
warm tears, a broken voice murmuring: ' My child, 
how I have wronged you ! . . . and now I love you 
so ' 'Oh! Aunt Susan,' I said, 'don't cry; I will 
love you too; my husband will be so happy.' We kissed 
each other, and said no more, and from that time Aunt 
Susan became my most faithful friend." 

Mrs. Hamerton has naturally many kind 
things to say of this country, where her hus- 
band's works have always been deservedly pop- 
ular ; and in this connection we may quote her 
note touching the honorable (if perhaps, from 
the piratical point of view, Quixotic) behavior 
towards Mr. Hamerton of an American pub- 
lishing firm, at a period when the rights of the 
British author here were fenced by no law- save

the moral one, " Thou shalt not steal." Says 
our author (1868) : 

"For some time past, Mr. Hamerton's reputation 
had been growing in America, but he did not derive the 
slightest profit from the sale of his books there till 
Messrs. Roberts Brothers, of Boston, proposed to pay 
him a royalty upon the works that should be published 
by them in advance of pirated editions. This offer was 
accepted with pleasure and gratitude, and the pecuniary 
result proved a timely help." 

We can promise Mr. Hamerton's many 
American admirers a treat in the perusal of 
this attractive volume. E. G. J. 



PRESENT EDUCATIONAL, TENDENCIES.* 



The two main trends in education to-day in 
the United States seem to be the importation 
of German ideas and the application of physio- 
logical and psychological science to child study 
and pedagogic theory. Hegel and Herbart 
among German philosophers are especially 
studied, and three of the books on our present 
list directly concern them. At least five others 
show the influence of the second trend. 

Dr. F. L. Luqueer, in " Hegel as Educator," 
deals with his subject in two parts, Part I. 
showing Hegel as student and teacher, and 
Part II. being a translation of Hegel's thoughts 
on education, mainly extracted from Thaulow :

about a hundred pages, is practically a popular 
life of Hegel, but a very carefully studied^ 
though not very original, presentation. The 
second part, of about the same number of pages, 
gives many of Hegel's most suggestive thoughts 
on education, and is preceded by a short but 
interesting introduction. 

Dr. W. M. Bryant's little book on " Hegel's 
Educational Ideas " is a far slighter contribu- 
tion to the subject than the one just noticed, 
yet it shows a certain originality and sugges- 
tiveness. Though the essay is an attempt to 
interpret Hegel's theory with direct reference 
to the educational needs of our own times, it is 
too general and indefinite to be of much service 
to practical teachers. The Hegelianism is 
somewhat too florid, and there is constant over- 
emphasis, as evidenced by the profuse itali- 
cizing. 

In Herbart's " A B C of Sense Perception " 
we have a more definite contribution to peda- 
gogy than in the case of the two previous vol- 
umes. Here Herbart expounds with some ful- 
ness his views of sense perception, and his 
mathematical methods of training it, that is 
by " the apperception of form through con- 
cepts," of which the triangle is the master one. 
This developing percept through concept is 
rather a reversal of the common method nowa 
days, which appeals solely to percepts to guide 
to concepts. Among the minor works trans- 
lated in this volume the most interesting and 
important is doubtless " The ^Esthetic Presen- 
tation of the Universe the Chief Office of Edu- 
cation," in which Herbart sets forth his ideal 
of education as the coordinate developing of 
Cognition and Sympathy toward the highest 
point, where the universal ethical and aesthetic 
significance is fully comprehended and acted 
on. Those who wish to attempt Herbart at 
first hand have in this book their opportunity. 
The translation appears to be well done by an 
enthusiastic Herbartian, Dr. W. J. Eckoff, who 
has added prefaces and introductions and an 
exhaustive analysis. 

To the second trend of educational tenden- 
cies, the psychological, belongs the volume on 
" Child Observations." This book consists of 
a bare record of rather commonplace observa- 
tions, preceded by an Introduction by Principal 
E. H. Russell. We are there told that these 
records are " not a scientific study of children, 
in the interest of psychology, but an attempt to 
bring our future teachers into closer and more 
sympathetic relations with them as individ- 
uals." We do not think this attempt to divorce 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



281 



sympathy and knowledge is very successful. 
Knowledge is necessary to sympathy, and sym- 
pathy to knowledge. All real insight quickens 
sympathy, and all sympathy quickens insight, 
which must be scientific to be true. As the 
physician and professional nurse study cases in 
the light of pure science, so must the educator 
do for his pupils. It is somewhat singular that 
Mr. Russell, after so vigorously declaiming 
against the selfishness of making child-life 
*' material " for science, should yet (p. xxxiii.) 
consider the " highest ideal " of such study as 
helping the observer to a full enjoyment of the 
varying phases of childhood. Mr. Russell 
(_p. xxix.) makes far too sharp a distinction 
between the child and the adult. In short, the 
introduction is quite too one-sided ; and the 
main body of the book, as a record of facts, 
shows too little insight by the observers, though 
it may impress some teachers with the power 
and scope of the mimetic tendency in children. 

In striking contrast with this rather crude 
work is Compayre's " Intellectual and Moral 
Development of the Child," which is an ex- 
tremely careful and thorough, yet sympathetic, 
summary of infant psychology. It is a clear 
and on the whole candid resume of the psychol- 
ogy of the first few months of the child's life, 
as illustrating perception, emotion, memory, 
imagination, and attention. Professor Com- 
payre often writes both clearly and forcibly, as 
when he says : " While in the adult the expres- 
sion falls short of the reality, in childhood it 
exceeds it. The child's embraces are in excess 
of his love ; he cries more than he suffers ; he 
laughs more than he is amused ; and when he 
has learned to talk, he will talk more than he 
thinks." It will certainly occur to many that 
talking more than one thinks is not wholly con- 
fined to children. The book would be improved 
by the addition of an index, and of a tabular 
outline of the growth of mind ; or at least these 
features should be incorporated in Part II., 
which we are glad to note is to follow this vol- 
ume. 

The third volume in the " Republic of Child- 
hood " series, coming after the volumes on 
"Froebel's Gifts" and "Froebel's Occupa- 
tions," is now before us with the title " Kinder- 
garten Principles and Practice." It treats, in a 
very clear and lively way, and yet with discrim- 
inating enthusiasm, of such topics as Nature- 
Study, Moral Training, and Kindergarten Play. 
As an interpretation and application of Froebel, 
it will be of great value to parents and teach- 
ers who wish an introduction to his system. 



Froebel, indeed, studied the child mainly 
through sympathy, but yet not unscientifically ; 
still, he made but a beginning, and on the whole 
he erred rather in over-emotionalism and over- 
tenderness toward making childhood a world in 
itself rather than a passing stage of develop- 
ment. This book, however, corrects to some 
extent this tendency, and becomes a very good 
introduction to modern Kindergarten practice. 
It may be doubted, however, whether the fem- 
inine spirit which so dominates Kindergarten- 
ism at present gives the complete environment 
for the young child, and whether it would not 
gain something by a training by men kinder- 
garteners. 

What the work just noticed does for the kin- 
dergarten, James Johonnot's " Principles and 
Practice of Teaching " does for the graded pub- 
lic school. We have here a thoroughly pro- 
gressive manual for the use of practical teach- 
ers. Training in natural science and in man- 
ual arts is especially emphasized. Still, the 
author by no means neglects the moral and 
a3sthetic culture. With regard to the former, 
he has a severe standard for the teacher as well 
as the pupil. " Of course," he says, " no per- 
son addicted to the use of strong drink or to- 
bacco should ever presume to take upon him- 
self the office of teacher." This revised edition 
of a well-known work especially emphasizes the 
interdependence of studies. In an appendix is 
reprinted the interesting " Story of a School," 
which so fully illustrates Mr. Johonnot's ideas 
on " incidental " moral training. 

Mr. A. H. Garlick's "New Manual of 
Method " is primarily intended for young teach- 
ers in English schools, and will hardly interest 
the American teacher save by an occasional 
suggestion by way of comparison of American 
and English practice. There are some points 
on which the American teacher would be sure 
to dissent, for instance, the necessity of cor- 
poral punishment, and the advisability of allow- 
ing poetry to be studied only at a late period 
in the pupil's work in English literature ; but 
in the main it will be found a sound though 
rather conservative manual. 

In the neat little volume entitled " The Ed- 
ucation of Children at Rome," Dr. George 
Clarke publishes his doctorate dissertation. It 
deals with the intellectual and moral side of 
Roman education, and brings out fully the 
practical bent of Roman life. The book is 
clearly written, and seems a trustworthy and 
scholarly handbook, and the only special work 
on the subject in the English language.

Mr. R. P. Halleck, in his " Education of the 
Central Nervous System," aims mainly at sen- 
sory training. His special aim "consists in 
showing that recalled images of sense objects 
are powerful and necessary aids in further mod- 
ifying and developing the sensory cells ; not 
images of sight alone, but of every sense. . . . 
From long personal experience, the author can 
testify that the majority of pupils can soon be 
induced to seize the first opportunity to obtain 
definite sensory knowledge of any object men- 
tioned in poetry, whether of a daffodil, of a 
murmuring pine, or of * incense breathing 
morn.' " How the study of literature may help 
the study of nature, and vice versa, is a very 
interesting topic, which, however, is plainly 
psychological, and receives very little elucida- 
tion from the study of the central nervous sys- 
tem. The most original and suggestive chap- 
ters are "Special Sensory Train ing "and "Form- 
ation of Images," where definite exercises are 
set, and a sort of sensory gymnastics prescribed. 

Dr. David Starr Jordan has been well known 
for years as a power in educational affairs, es- 
pecially in the West ; and his volume on " The 
Care and Culture of Men " presents in popular 
form the ideas which have made him so influ- 
ential as a radical leader. In such chapters as 
those on " The Value of Higher Education," 
" The Scholar in the Community," "The School 
and the State," we have large, hopeful, and 
progressive ideas, set forth in the vigorous style 
of an accomplished orator, and enlivened with 
varied quotation, incident, and anecdote. Even 
those who disagree fundamentally with Dr. Jor- 
dan's main positions will find much that is of 
value. While the book is in no large sense an 
addition to pedagogical literature, it will yet be 
stimulating to teachers and others interested in 
education. HIRAM M. STANLEY. 



THE LIFE OF WILLIAM H. SEWARD.* 



Rich in material illustrative of the early and 
middle periods of the political history of the 
United States, the " American Statesmen Se- 
ries " has contained but two volumes covering 
the important years between the Compromise of 
1850 and the Civil War, these being the biog- 
raphies of Lewis Cass and Abraham Lincoln. 
The story of William Henry Seward would be 
acceptable as a valuable contribution to our his-

tory, giving as it does a full account of the 
problems connected with slavery between the 
Kansas Bill and Emancipation, even were it not 
permeated with the personality of the great 
statesman whose name appears upon the title- 
page. For thirty-one years, beginning as Gov- 
ernor of New York and ending as Secretary of 
State under Johnson, he gave his life to the 
public. The most momentous questions of 
American history were decided during this 
period ; political parties sprang into being and 
died ; legislative struggles gave place to the 
battle of bullets. It was a difficult task to 
keep the story within the limits of a single vol 
ume, and the decision to give greater attention 
to the decade from 1855 till 1865 was a proper 
one, considering the prominence of the position 
of Mr. Seward in that trying time. 

William H. Seward was a man of inferior 
physique, with few graces of oratory and little 
power to command the attention and sway the 
feelings of an audience. When his contem- 
poraries, Clay or Webster, addressed the Sen- 
ate, every seat was filled and every nerve was 
strained to catch the full effect of the words of 
the speaker ; when Seward spoke, it was to 
empty benches. But, while sometimes the influ- 
ence of the speeches of the gifted orators passed 
away with the dramatic triumphs of the moment 
of delivery, the words of Seward, widely scat- 
tered and translated for the benefit of foreign- 
born readers, had as great influence in molding 
the thought of the people during the years of 
his public life as any other force operating in 
our history. In this connection it is necessary 
to mention only the speeches in which he set 
forth the " higher law," the " irrepressible con- 
flict," and his views in opposition to the repeal 
of the Missouri Compromise. 

Seward was a man who often showed great 
lack of tact in dealing with his fellows and in 
discussing burning questions of the day. He 
left the executive chair at Albany, sharing with 
the public generally the feeling that his public 
life was ended. His college essay, showing the 
Erie Canal an impossibility as well as a source 
of financial ruin to the state, was a youthful 
predecessor of later effusions of similar weak- 
ness. He published an unfortunate letter at 
the opening of Taylor's administration, de- 
signed to exonerate the President from the 
charge of using his personal influence for leg- 
islation that would practically extend slavery 
to the territories, but which had the effect of 
calling the attention of the public to his own 
friendly relations with the President, and inci-

dentally of alienating other prominent Whig 
leaders. The same lack of tact was shown on 
the occasion of the visit of the Hungarian pa- 
triots to the United States, in the dealings with 
Justice Campbell at the outbreak of the Re- 
bellion, in his dispatch to Minister Adams in 
England, reflecting or seeming to reflect upon 
Congress, and, most conspicuous example of 
all, in his " Thoughts for the President's Con- 
sideration," when he volunteered to run the gov- 
ernment for Mr. Lincoln. 

If he failed as an orator, except in the coin- 
ing of apt phrases that served as political catch- 
words, and often displayed weakness in critical 
moments, he had in him a more striking ele- 
ment of worth, which led him again and again, 
during his long and varied public career, to re- 
fuse to sacrifice principle for expediency. He 
manifested this quality in taking charge of un- 
popular criminal cases in his law practice, in 
adhering to his support of Adams for the pres- 
idency when he held in his hand a position 
offered by a rival candidate, Clinton, and in fav- 
oring a recognition of parochial schools in the 
distribution of public funds for education. He 
opposed the policy of Fillmore on the Compro- 
mise measures, when such action meant the 
proscription of himself and his party friends in 
New York. He antagonized the leaders of the 
Know-Nothing movement, when by using them 
he might have received the nomination for the 
presidency in 1856, and, by carrying states 
which were opposed to Fremont, have made 
himself President. He favored strengthening 
the hands of the President in the Mormon mat- 
ter, when his fellow Republicans opposed it, 
recalling the use of the army in Kansas ; and 
he was not moved by the sinister allusions to 
" bedevilled " persons and " Judas Iscariot." 

These characteristics of the man are admir- 
ably brought out by Mr. Lothrop, Seward's 
new biographer. Blame is not spared when 
serious blunders were made, and over-praise is 
not given for the excellences that shone on other 
occasions. To this extent the volume will be 
generally considered a success ; when contro- 
versies are discussed, there may be differences 
of opinion. The " malignant posthumous attack 
on Seward," made by Montgomery Blair in 
Mr. Welles's " Lincoln and Seward," charging 
Mr. Seward with forcing the repeal of the Mis- 
souri Compromise by putting up Dixon of Ken- 
tucky to move it, is completely answered by the 
correct statement of the facts of history. The 
chapter which discusses the relations existing 
between Mr. Seward and Justice Campbell is 



not so satisfactory. If the former was not 
aware that the latter was wearing the livery of 
the Federal Courts to serve the Confederacy 
in, he yet appeared in an unfortunate role, and 
displayed the same lack of discretion which he 
so often manifested elsewhere. In the assign- 
ment of credit in connection with the Trent 
affair, the difficult task of removing laurels 
from a popular idol is satisfactorily done. 
Americans are becoming very sensitive about 
Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Morse's life of Lin- 
coln, and a recent monograph upon "The 
Trent Affair " by Mr. Thomas L. Harris, state 
conclusions essentially different from those 
reached by Mr. Lothrop ; but the weight of 
authority is with the latter. More than once, 
when diplomatic difficulties were discussed, 
Mr. Seward's notions were utterly impractica- 
ble and needed the revision of such a thought- 
ful mind as that of Abraham Lincoln ; but the 
conclusion is definitely reached that in the 
Trent affair Mr. Seward took the initiative as 
the Secretary responsible for foreign relations, 
and that Mr. Lincoln and the other members 
of the cabinet came to his position. The spe- 
cial chapter on diplomatic questions clearly 
indicates the variety of international problems 
of the period of the Civil War, and emphasizes 
the great services of Mr. Seward in a field 
where the pen rather than the sword won vic- 
tories for the Union. 

Other chapters of the book might call for 
consideration if the limits of space would allow. 
The story of the development of the Republican 
party and the account of the convention of 
1860 are naturally marked by a strong Seward 
sentiment. The strictures on Horace Greeley 
seem warranted after a re-reading of Greeley's 
own statement in his " Recollections of a Busy 
Life "; and while there appears a discordant 
note in the references to Abraham Lincoln in 
connection with the nomination in 1860, it is 
the comparatively unknown Abraham Lincoln 
of that year who is mentioned, and not the 
great emancipator enshrined in the hearts of 
the people. Too many unsettled matters re- 
main to make it worth while to note the diffi- 
culties of Reconstruction connected with the 
administration of Andrew Johnson, but it is 
questionable if a due amount of attention is 
paid to the Alaska purchase, which is dismissed 
with a short paragraph and without recognition 
of Mr. Seward's prescience as to the import- 
ance of the Pacific Ocean in the manifest des- 
tiny of the United States, in which he firmly 
believed. FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON.

THE COUNTRY OF HORACE AND VIRGIL.* 

M. Marie Louis Gaston Boissier is one of 
those charming French scholars who are such 
graceful interpreters of the best thought of 
Greece and Rome. Since 1876, he has been 
the incumbent of a fauteuil in the French 
Academy, and has not slept in it, as his several 
books and frequent articles attest : possibly, 
too, his august duties as permanent secretary 
of the Immortal Forty have helped to stimu- 
late his activity. Formerly professor of Latin 
oratory at the College de France, he has rarely 
departed from the field of Roman study covered 
by the last years of the Republic and the first 
century of the Empire. His scholarship, while 
not portentous, is yet painstaking ; his conclu- 
sions in matters of classic topography are based 
upon thorough personal investigation : and the 
arguments with which these conclusions are 
presented are so graciously and winningly sug- 
gested for our consideration that we cannot but 
extend to them the courtesy common among 
gentlemen, and perhaps yield to their charm of 
manner the assent which a more hardened 
say a Teutonic critic would withhold. In a 
certain sense M. Boissier may be said to have 
done for Horace and Virgil in France what the 
lamented Sellar has done for them in England ; 
though his work lacks the steadiness of glow 
and the symmetrical unity of " The Roman 
Poets of the Augustan Age." 

The book before us is a translation of his 
" The Country of Horace and Virgil," in which 
the poets' personalities are projected, as it were, 
against a background formed by their favorite 
haunts. To Horace are devoted fifty-eight pages. 
Then follows an excursus (pp. 59-115) on the 
tombs of Corneto ; and the rest of the book 
(pp. 116-346, or just two-thirds of the whole) 
is occupied with Virgil and the ^Eneid. 

M. Boissier sketches with free hand the rela- 
tions of Horace to Maecenas ; and dwells on the 
joy the poet must have felt in receiving from 
the hands of his patron an estate in the Sabine 
hill-country. To locate this country-house is 
the labor of love which our author sets for him- 
self ; and he invites his readers to a " person- 
ally conducted " jaunt to the valley of the Anio 
and the Licenza. Moving up the west bank of 
the latter stream, he shows us the spot to which 
his reading of the poet has led him as the site of 
the Villula, as Horace modestly terms it ; and

sier. Translated by D. Ilavelock Fisher. With Maps and 
Plans. New York : Q. P. Putnam's Sons. 



he finds it half-way up the hill rising west of 
the river and in the immediate neighborhood 
of the old church of Santa Maria della Casa. 
He gives persuasive reasons for this site, and 
for differing with Capmartin de Chaupy and 
De Sanctis, who are for a location farther north 
and more toward the foot of the hill. It should 
be said, however, that Professor Sellar (in an 
elaborate foot-note on page 31 of his " Horace 
and the Elegiac Poets ") lends the weight of 
his authority to the latter view ; and students 
of Horace may profitably read and weigh the 
evidence offered by the French and the En- 
glish scholar in support of their respective 
opinions. 

The section of M. Boissier's book which 
treats of the Etruscan tombs at Corneto lacks, 
of course, personal interest ; and it is hard to 
find adequate reasons for its insertion here. 
As an antiquarian essay it is a piece of good 
work ; and the matter is presented with the 
writer's usual vivacity and a sort of charm 
(charis), like that which Dionysius assigned 
to the orator Lysias ; but it serves in the pres- 
ent instance only as an interruption, which will 
be skipped by many readers in their hurry to 
get from Horace to Virgil. 

M. Boissier has certainly added a fresh 
attraction to the great Augustan epic by his 
rapid and yet searching analysis of the ^Eneas 
legend and his tracing of the process of assim- 
ilation by which this old Trojan hero came to 
assume an Italian physiognomy. This process 
is followed from the earliest Homeric account 
of 2Eneas down to the time when he received 
his fresh baptism of immortality from Virgil. 
The explanation of Virgil's motives in choos- 
ing this legend as the subject of a great his- 
torico-mythological epic is full and satisfactory. 
Then comes an extended but most interesting 
description of the journeys of ^Eneas ; in which, 
with the poem as our guide-book and M. Bois- 
sier as a genial and sympathetic cicerone, we 
are led peacefully enough over land and sea in 
the track of the much-tried but always pious 
son of Anchises. Sicily, of course, is given a 
prominent place in these wanderings ; but the 
chief merit of the work is the successful clear- 
ing up of obscurities in the topography of the 
Trojan and Latin camps at the Tiber's mouth. 
The sites of Ostia, Lavinium and Laurentum 
are convincingly identified ; the episode of Nisus 
and Euryalus receives new light ; and the con- 
cluding battles of the Trojans and Rutuli are 
admirably sketched and discussed. 

We are compelled to add that the translation

lying before us is an unworthy and slovenly 
thing. The reproach of tradittore traduttore 
was never more deserved than in this instance. 
It is too bad that so refined a scholar as Gaston 
Boissier should be so disastrously presented to 
American readers as has been his fate in the 
hands of Mr. D. Havelock Fisher. The errors 
and blunders swarm in such profusion that they 
are susceptible of classification. Most numer- 
ous and vexatious are the misprints in Latin 
citations and Greek or Latin proper names. 
Of the forty-odd specimens in this class we 
may mention utili for utilis, accipieno for acci- 
piens, erant for errant, rerem mili for rerum 
mihi, Polycletes, Marsci, Pythagorus, Demo- 
dochus, Phaecians, Acestus, Taorminus, Cu- 
mea, Maegara, Thassos, Aen. for Eel., Ibid. 
for Idyll, Ibid, for Sat., Egl. for Eel. Lucian 
is substituted for Lucan (p. 166), Socrates for 
Sophocles (p. 174), Gothic for Doric (p. 233), 
Trojan for Trajan (p. 309). Before Greek the 
translator or proof-reader simply " lies down ": 
as seen in the two attempts on pp. 130, 326. 
Gains (p. 77) is a poor exchange for games, 
having an unpleasant suggestion of profession- 
alism ; and annuli (p. 110) is perhaps intended 
for curule. 

The author's sense has evidently been re- 
versed in this (p. 60): " Reluctance to remain 
ignorant of the past history of a race which 
held an important place among ancient nations 
is a thing I cannot understand." On page 62 
we read : " One does not think of stopping at 
the intermediate stations, it is true, nor does 
what one sees of the Tuscan Maremma in this 
rapid flight make one wish to visit it more 
clearly. -Yet it is wrong to do so." To do what ? 
On page 72, speaking of Etruscan tombs, this 
translator makes M. Boissier say or seem to say : 
" Nothing now remains which could be carried 
off that is to say, the mural paintings." On 
page 85, the Marseillais are described as enter- 
ing Paris singing the hymn of " Rouget de 
risle "/ the name of the author being quoted 
and italicized as if it were the name of the song. 
In the matter of dates, 707 (p. 15) should be 
717 ; and 514 B. c. (p. 144) should drop the 
B.C., or change 514 to 240. 

Such and so many offences as these, whether 
due to ignorance or carelessness, or both, are 
yet not enough to obscure the merits of M. 
Boissier's book ; and may even give it a facti- 
tious value as an exercise-book of mistakes, to 
be corrected by young students of Horace and 
Virgil.

Mrs. Humphry Ward's new novel is a sequel to 
"Marcella," and, although another name had to be 
given it, Lady Maxwell is the central figure. It is 
good to be in the company of such souls, even after 
we have learned to know them so well that they no 
longer have the interest of the unexpected, and no 
justification is needed for this continuation of Mar- 
cella's life of helpful philanthropic endeavor. It is 
because the interest of the book centres chiefly in 
her that the tragic death of the titular character, 
Sir George Tressady, which takes us so by surprise 
at the close, does not affect the reader as deeply as

[Nov. 16, 



it otherwise might. His death seems to us uncalled- 
for, since the whole tenor of the novel is far from 
tragic in so inevitable a sense as that, and before 
the catastrophe is reached the way seems already 
paved for a real union of hearts between Sir George 
and his vixenish but chastened wife. On the whole, 
the tragedy of the final chapter seems rather wan- 
ton. The political motive largely influences the ac- 
tion of this novel, and surprise is frequently occa- 
sioned by the author's firm grasp of recent English 
political life. An old parliamentarian could hardly 
have done better in depicting the course of a momen- 
tous piece of legislation through the House of Com- 
mons, in doing justice to all the interests concerned 
and seeing the subject from all the points of view, 
in describing the machinery of the legislative pro- 
cess. The Bill in question is a radical, almost a 
revolutionary, one ; it seeks effectively to limit the 
hours of labor and the freedom of the individual, 
whether employer or employed. The Maxwells are 
heart and soul in its support ; Tressady, on the 
other hand, is a prominent figure of the opposition, 
but changes his vote at a critical juncture, and saves 
both Bill and Government, although at the cost of 
his own political career. It need hardly be said 
that Marcella exerts the influence, although semi- 
unconsciously, by which this change of policy for 
it is not a change of conviction is brought about. 
We feel throughout the wish of the writer to deal 
fairly with the vital matter under discussion, yet we 
must admit that she allows emotion to outweigh 
reason, and that her sympathies are enlisted in be- 
half of a dangerous principle. The balance which 
in " Marcella " seemed to be justly held between the 
opposing forces of socialism and individualism, 
seems in " Sir George Tressady " to tip a little too 
far to the wrong side. So much for the argument 
of the book. As for the workmanship, it is so fin- 
ished and conscientious as to be productive of a high 
degree of satisfaction ; it betrays a rich human ex- 
perience, an analytical mind, and a generous heart. 
Somehow it does not interest us as deeply as " Rob- 
ert Elsmere " and " David Grieve " did, although 
in many respects a fuller mastery of the material 
is evidenced. The force with which Mrs. Ward's 
novels have impressed us is fully sustained in this the 
latest of them, but we miss the freshness of appeal 
which made " Robert Elsmere " seem to speak to us 
with a new voice. But the best of novelists cannot 
escape this fate, although some perhaps have come 
nearer to escaping it than the present writer. 

To turn from the strong, sane, and carefully- 
balanced picture of life given us in Mrs. Ward's 
book to the hysterical mysticism of " Without Sin " 
is to experience about as sharp a contrast as books 
can offer. " Martin J. Pritchard " is, we under- 
stand, the assumed name of a woman, and the 
woman has in this case outdone all that man ever 
dreamed of daring. Never before, we should say, 
did modern novelist attempt so flatly impossible a 
subject as this. And yet the first impulse to con- 
demn the book without reserve is checked by a feel- 



ing that somehow the writer could not have imag- 
ined the unspeakable off ensiveness of her theme and 
its treatment ; there is a kind of sincerity about the 
workmanship which forbids the supposition that the 
writer's sole aim was to startle her public, and one 
must reluctantly admit that the narrative is infused 
with the sentiment that awes us in Rossetti's " Ave." 
But these qualifications can have no further effect 
than to soften in some degree the condemnation 
which both religious and literary criticism are bound 
to pass upon the fantastical and morbid imaginings 
of a book that had far better have remained un- 
written. 

A sort of mysticism is also the note of Mr. F. W. 
Bourdillon's " NepheleY' but it is as different as 
possible from the mysticism of the book previously 
mentioned. If it were not for a single matchless 
lyric, Mr. Bourdillon's name would be absolutely 
unknown to the general reader, and as it is, the 
appearance of a prose romance from his pen is a 
good deal of a surprise. It must be admitted at 
the outset that the conception of " Nephele' " is 
based upon an impossibility, but we find this no very 
grave impediment to the enjoyment of a book so 
self-consistent within its own limits, and so beautiful 
as an example of literary composition. There is in 
the handling of the theme so much delicacy and 
spiritual suggestiveness, so elevated a sentiment, 
and so pure a diction, that we are willing to accept 
" telepathy " or any other impossiblity when we 
realize that without it such a book could not have 
been written at all. The story is of a mystical 
union of souls through the agency of music, and the 
message of that divinest of arts has rarely been put 
into words so glowing and so eloquent. To the 
unmusical it must seem a meaningless rhapsody ; 
but those to whom the world of tone is as real as 
the world of poetry will take the book to their heart 
of hearts. 

Dr. Watson's " Kate Carnegie " seems to have 
been timed to appear in America coincidently with 
the author's visit. Those who have made his ac- 
quaintance will find in the book a reflection of his 
genial personality, and others will be justified in the 
surmise that they could hardly know him any better 
from personal intercourse than from his books. It 
is indeed something of a puzzle to account for the 
popularity of all the " bonnie brier bush " writing 
and " kailyard literature " of which this is an aver- 
age specimen. The Scots dialect would seem to be 
a distinct drawback to one's enjoyment, and it is 
impossible to describe the book fairly without ad- 
mitting that it is both rambling and commonplace. 
It is a menagerie of parsons rather than a novel, 
for we are treated to no less than three full-length 
clerical portraits, and the love-story is hardly more 
than an incident. Whatever elements of strength 
the book may possess are to be sought in its flashes 
of humor, its touches of pathos, and its shrewd de- 
lineative strokes. It is not remarkable for any of 
these things, but it is moderately pleasing, and irre- 
proachably wholesome in sentiment. 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

" The Gray Man " is a very different sort of story. 
A historical romance of the times of James VI. of 
Scotland, it deals with the clan feuds that kept Scot- 
land on the verge of civil war, and is abundantly 
supplied with picturesque and romantic episodes. 
But it drags a good deal, and its real power is to be 
sought in the handling of a few special situations 
rather than in its conception as a whole. Mr. Crockett 
has probably never done anything better than the 
chapter which tells us about " The Last of the Gray 
Man," while two or three other episodes rise to 
nearly the same level of graphic and dramatic power. 
A good deal of actual history has been worked into 
the web of the author's romance, and much of the 
invention bears the stamp of artistic truth. 

Of the three Scotch novelists now prominently 
before the public, Mr. J. M. Barrie seems to be the 
most talented, and he too contributes a book to the 
season's output of fiction. We are inclined, more- 
over, to think it the best book he has written. 
Although " Sentimental Tommy " shares in the con- 
structive weakness displayed by the two Scotch 
stories just mentioned, and is, like them, a series of 
episodes and sketches rather than an organic whole, 
there is exhibited in the details of its workmanship 
so fine an art that criticism may for once be content 
to praise without cavil. The inner life of childhood 
is for most writers unexplored territory. They may 
write about it and around it, but few retain a mem- 
ory of their early days so vivid as to enable them to 
reproduce the world from the child's point of view. 
But Stevenson did it, and Mr. Kenneth Grahame 
has done it, and so has Mr. Barrie in this extraor- 
dinary book. " Imaginative " would, however, be a 
better adjective for his hero than " Sentimental," 
for it is in his delineation of the imaginative aspect 
of child-life that the author has achieved his suc- 
cess. The wonder-world that a child can create for 
himself in the most commonplace environment is 
here realized with a subtle insight almost beyond 
praise. The story of the last Jacobite rising, for 
example, comes near to being a work of genius, and 
can hardly miss some share of the " immortality " 
it deserves. Mr. Barrie has not only been a boy, 
like the rest of us, but has remained one at heart, as 
few of the rest of us succeed in doing. And his 
Tommy is one of the most genuine boys in literature. 

Mr. Standish O'Grady is the author of a number 
of romantic novels having for their common pur- 
pose " to illuminate, in some degree, aspects of the 
history, genius, and traditions of Ireland. The lat- 
est two of these works are before us. The one, 
called " Ulrick the Ready," is a story of the closing 
years of Elizabeth's reign ; the other, " In the Wake 
of King James," a tale of the period just after the 
Battle of the Boyne. Mr. O'Grady is evidently a close 
student of Irish history and antiquities, but he can- 
not fairly be called a skilled literary craftsman. The 
first of the books just named is absolutely chaotic in 
structure, and so swamped with history, genealogy, 
and archaeology as to be well-nigh unreadable. The 
lecond, being mainly a private concern, has some 



degree of symmetry, and tells its tale of adventure 
in a reasonably thrilling way. It is far from being 
unreadable, and its matter is not quite so hackneyed 
as is the stuff of most of our recent historical fiction. 

The artistic effect that Mr. O'Grady, despite his 
knowledge and industry, has failed to produce, ap- 
pears very noticeably in " The Silk of the Kine," 
an Irish story of the period when the " curse of 
Cromwell " had just fallen upon the land. A well- 
conceived and pathetic situation is portrayed by the 
author with swift sure strokes, and the romance is 
alike pleasing for its narrative and its diction. The 
heroine is a fair maiden of noble birth, orphaned 
by the wars and " transplanted " by order of the 
Protector. A young English officer chances to save 
her from death or worse, and to intervene in the 
dangers that subsequently beset her. In the end, 
he sacrifices his position and his prospects for her 
sake, and is about to carve out for himself a new life 
upon the Continent, when a pardon from the Pro- 
tector changes his plans, and serves to make his 
story end happily. 

" The King's Revenge " takes us back to the early 
fourteenth century, and has for its chief historical 
figures the ill-fated King Edward II. and his hap- 
less favorite, Piers Gaveston. We do not recollect 
that this story has been used for imaginative pur- 
poses by any modern novelist, or, indeed, since Mar- 
lowe found in it the stuff for the greatest of his 
tragedies. Mr. Claude Bray, the author, has a name 
that is new to us, but he seems to have learned 
fairly well the lesson of historical romance. Per- 
haps it would be difficult to learn that lesson ill at a 
time when the art of fiction based upon history finds 
so many skilled practitioners. Mr. Bray is weakest 
in his love story, which is told in the most perfunc- 
tory manner, and strongest in his delineation of the 
turbulent barons who plunged England into civil 
war after the strength and resolution of the First 
Edward had given place to the feebleness and vanity 
of the Second. 

Mr. Bloundelle-Burton, who appears twice in our 
current list of novels, delves for his material in the 
rich mine of French history and chronicle. " In the 
Day of Adversity " is a romance of the days of 
Louis XIV., and has a stirring picture of the sea- 
fight at La Hogue, besides a realistic account of the 
horrors of the galleys, and a web of private intrigue 
sufficiently complicated to hold the interest at a high 
tension. " Denounced " is a story of " the Forty- 
five," and thus partly English in theme. Its chief 
interest, however, is in the imprisonment of its hero 
in the Bastille by means of a lettre de cachet, and 
its careful account, based upon documentary evi- 
dence, of the life of an inmate of that famous, or 
infamous, stronghold of tyranny. The author of 
these two books has caught the trick of historical 
romance quite successfully, and his name must be 
added to the list, already a long one, of recent work- 
ers in this inexhaustible domain. 

" The Courtship of Morrice Buckler " is a ro- 
mance that starts bravely out on historical lines, 



288 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



plunging us into the days of Monmouth Rebellion 
and the Bloody Assize. But the historical thread 
is soon dropped, and we find our interest enlisted 
in a romance of private intrigue and adventure 
which takes us hack and forth from England to the 
Tyrol, and abounds in highly-colored passions and 
villainies. The plot is constructed with exceptional 
skill, and we are not left at the close, as is so often 
the case in historical romance, with a lot of tag-ends 
in our hands. Everything is explained in the most 
comfortable way before we get through, the writer 
thereby earning our very lively gratitude. 

" Battlement and Tower " is a historical romance 
of Wales during the Civil War, when the fortunes of 
the King were waning, and only a few loyal souls 
here and there stood fast in their allegiance. It is 
royalist in its sympathies (as somehow nearly all the 
good romances of this period are), and pursues its 
course with a fiery energy that holds the reader 
breathless. Those who love fighting, and thrilling 
escapes, and dare-devil adventures, will find full 
measure of such things in this book, besides a 
chronicle of heroic devotion and faithful love. The 
action is often too tangled to be easily followed, and 
the style is too turgid to be satisfactory, but there is 
no denying that the story has life and interest in 
abundance. 

" The Finding of Lot's Wife " is a romance in 
the manner made familiar by the stories of Mr. 
Rider Haggard. All that is needed for this sort of 
story is an imperfectly-known part of the earth, 
where anything may be supposed to happen for lack 
of proof to the contrary, and a certain amount of a 
cheap sort of imagination. Mr. Clark tells us of a 
mysterious monastery in southeastern Palestine, 
inhabited by monks having an ancient ritual of their 
own, and unknown to the world in general. A num- 
ber of explorers find their way to this spot, investi- 
gate its marvels, discover among other things the 
veritable rock-salt statue of Lot's wife, and escape 
to civilization in the end. The story is strewn with 
grewsome horrors and romantic adventures, and 
proves readable, but by no means wildly exciting. 

The readers of Mr. Boothby's " A Bid for For- 
tune " will remember the uncanny Dr. Nikola and 
the curious black stick, once owned by "China 
Pete," that finds its way into his possession. " Dr. 
Nikola " the book is a sort of sequel to the other 
romance, and tells us how, by means of the same 
black stick, the wizard penetrates into an unknown 
Chinese monastery, and possesses himself of the 
ancient mysteries of the order. It is an extravagant 
tale, not without a certain interest, and far superior 
to the story of Lot's wife as an excitement-producer. 

The marked impetus given of late to the study of 
colonial history is having its effect upon the novelist, 
and the number of tales based upon the annals of 
our forefathers increases steadily from year to year. 
The instinct which leads to the writing of these 
books is a sound one, although the books themselves 
are too often antiquarian studies and nothing more. 
It would, of course, be unreasonable to expect an- 



other " Scarlet Letter," for so rare a genius as that 
of Hawthorne blossoms only now and then in the 
centuries ; but it is not unreasonable to hope for a 
considerable production of historical novels upon 
American themes that shall be fairly comparable 
with the many good books that have recently given 
us such a surfeit of English and Continental histor- 
ical romance. Such a book as Mr. Stimson's " King 
Noanett " belongs distinctly to this class ; it is an 
admirably planned and executed story, based upon 
a careful study of documentary evidence, yet keep- 
ing the antiquarian subordinate to the human inter- 
est. It pretends to be the personal narrative of one 
Bampfylde Carew, an English youth who becomes 
implicated in a royalist rising against the govern- 
ment of the Protector, and is deported to Virginia 
in a convict ship. He remains in the Old Dominion 
for a time, then makes his escape to New England, 
and spends the rest of his days among Puritans and 
Indians. The execution of the work is painstaking, 
and it need hardly be added that Mr. Stimson's 
long and successful literary experience stands him 
in good stead in what must be considered the most 
ambitious of his novels. There is an abundance 
of picturesque detail in the book, and the thread 
of a tender love-story runs though it all, giving it 
coherence and a heightened interest. We think there 
is still a little too much of antiquarianism about the 
work that the note-book is too much in evidence 
but when we consider the difficulty of the author's 
task, and the fact that he has been working in a 
new medium, it must be allowed that he has been 
strikingly successful. The illustrations made by 
Mr. Henry Sandham have caught the spirit of the 
text and the time, adding not a little to the attrac- 
tiveness of the romance. 

" The Regicides " is another story of the same 
period, and has for its subject the adventures of 
Goffe and Whalley in eluding the pursuit of the 
royal warrant for their arrest. The book offers a 
conscientious study of Puritan Connecticut, but can- 
dor compels to the statement that it proves only 
mildly exciting at the best, while at the worst it is 
unmistakably dull. In this case, antiquarianism has 
clearly got the better of art. 

In turning from these essays in romance to the 
story of " Mrs. Cliff's Yacht," we turn from actual 
history to the most whimsical of invention. Mr. 
Stockton's method of treating highly improbable 
situations in the most matter-of-fact way is too 
familiar to call for exposition. Readers of " Cap- 
tain Horn " will remember Mrs. Cliff well enough, 
and be prepared for the sober joy of learning what 
she did with her share of the treasure of the Incas, 
and how the good people of Plainton, Maine, were 
impressed with her goings-on. The story is rather 
tedious until the yacht appears, and its owner sails 
the Southern seas with her crew of clergymen. At 
this juncture the story becomes transformed into 
a thrilling tale of adventure, and justifies its title 
to be considered a true sequel to " Captain Horn."

a whimsical tale, as its title would indicate, but of 
a sort very different from the book last mentioned. 
The most extraordinary things happen in its pages, 
and the interest is all the time kept agog, but Mr. 
Frederic has too much of the artistic instinct to per- 
mit even the fantastic creations of this most improb- 
able narrative to remain mere pegs upon which to 
hang his inventions. In their strangest doings 
they seem creatures of flesh and blood, and they 
make their final exit in accordance with the conven- 
tional forms. The book brings fresh testimony to 
Mr. Frederic's facile versatility, and may be de- 
pended upon to afford an hour of very genuine 
amusement. 

When we reviewed the translation of Herr Pon- 
toppidan's " Emanuel " a few weeks ago, it was 
stated that this novel was the first part of a trilogy 
depicting the Grundtvigian peasant movement in 
Denmark, and the hope was expressed that the other 
parts " The Promised Land" and "The Day of 
Judgment " might also be given to English read- 
ers. Sooner than we anticipated, the wish has been 
fulfilled, as far, at least, as it concerned the second 
part of the trilogy. In " Emanuel " we read of the 
enthusiastic young pastor who renounced his worldly 
associations, and cast his lot with the peasants to the 
extent of marrying a girl of their caste. In " The 
Promised Land," we are introduced to the house- 
hold of this man seven or eight years later, when 
the illusion has faded, and when he realizes the 
truth that no man's will is strong enough to sustain 
him undiscouraged in breaking with the social tra- 
ditions and nurture that have formed his character. 
It is the stage of disillusionment that we are now 
called upon to contemplate, and the picture is simply 
but powerfully drawn. In the end, Emanuel and 
his wife separate by mutual consent for an indef- 
inite period, and the man goes back to his father's 
house in Copenhagen to take up what threads he 
may of the life upon which he fondly thought to 
have turned his back forever. We shall await with 
great interest the concluding section of this novel, 
which is so genuine in its human interest, and which 
lies so far apart from the usual range of English 
fiction. The translation, we regret to say, is far 
from satisfactory. 

" Black Diamonds " is one of the best of the 
novels of Mr. Jokai that have thus far been put into 
English. We wish, however, that the English were 
the work of a more competent hand. The subject 
of the work has a great deal to do with coal-mining, 
and the translator confronts us at times with a sci- 
entific jargon that is absolutely meaningless, and 
that will make chemists, in particular, rub their eyes 
in wonder. We suspect that the author is not him- 
self very accurate in his use of scientific terms, but 
the translator has undoubtedly added to whatever 
confusion exists in the original. The story is a 
happy blend of the elements of romance with those 
of everyday life. We have, on the one hand, the 
romantic environment of mid-Hungary, and, on the 
other, the intrigues of a gay society and the trickery 



of the stock exchange. The action is varied, ani- 
mated, and sufficiently exciting to sustain the read- 
er's interest, to which a constant appeal is also made 
by the fresh and piquant aspects given the book by 
its Hungarian atmosphere. The element of the 
fantastic, which is so characteristic of this novelist, is 
very marked, and we resign ourselves from the start 
to the bizarre incident and unexpected happening. 

The author of " The Green Carnation " has col- 
lected into a small volume three short stories of 
more than usual power. They are studies in mor- 
bid psychology, and one of them, dealing with the 
reincarnation of a murdered cat, goes to the extreme 
of the fantastic. The cat comes back to life in the 
form of a beautiful woman, marries her slayer, and 
strangles him at night. The story would be the 
merest rubbish were it not for a certain Poe-like 
quality of the imagination displayed in working out 
this uncanny conception. The other two stories 
move among the possibilities of life, at least, although 
having little enough to do with life as normally con- 
stituted. 

We thought that Sherlock Holmes was dead, but 
it is certainly he who masquerades under an as- 
sumed name in the " Chronicles of Martin Hewitt." 
He investigates mysterious cases with the same 
practised ease as of old, is equally possessed of stores 
of recondite knowledge, and treats the methods of 
the professional detective with the same old tolerant 
condescension. Mr. Morrison is a good imitator, 
but it takes an unusual degree of audacity to borrow 
another man's thunder in this wholesale fashion. 
In every essential respect these stories are Sherlock 
Holmes stories and nothing more ; the inventions 
are new, but the conception is without originality. 

Readers of the popular magazines will be prompt 
to recognize some of their old friends in the volume 
of seven stories that give us, as far as book-form is 
concerned, the aftermath of the late H. C. Banner's 
genius. We are inclined to think " As One Having 
Authority," here published, the best short story that 
Banner ever wrote, although " Zadoc Pine " is a 
close second. " Love in Old Cloathes," also a favorite, 
opens the present collection, and has for its fellows 
" French for a Fortnight," with its irresistibly hu- 
morous conception, " Our Aromatic Uncle," and 
three others, the least of which is better than the 
best of an ordinary story-teller. 

The six " Tales of Fantasy and Fact " which Mr. 
Brander Matthews has put together into a volume 
are the merest trifles as to substance, but Mr. Mat- 
thews has a manner that can make even trifles 
charming, and his newest book is readable for as 
long as it lasts. " A Primer of Imaginary Geog- 
raphy " is a fancy suggestive of, if not suggested by, 
Hawthorne ; " The Rival Ghosts " has something of 
the Stocktonian flavor ; while " The Twinkling of 
an Eye " is neither more nor less than a detective 
story that mark you took a prize in a news- 
paper competition. The other three stories, if such 
they may be called, are of much less importance.

Electricity and

The f unct ' on of the seer has not 
ended, as many would have us be- 
\\Q VQ ^ but the subjects of his visions 
have changed in the changing years. James Clerk 
Maxwell, the story of whose life and work is so 
clearly told by his successor, Professor Glazebrook, 
in a volume of the " Century Science Series " (Mac- 
millan), possessed in a remarkable degree that 
keener vision which penetrates the arcana of nature 
and brings to view the methods of her most occult 
processes. Maxwell's work, done in the third quar- 
ter of the current century, was expended chiefly 
along three related lines of physical research. The 
first investigated the subject of Color Perception, in 
which by ingenious methods of combination and 
rotation he showed that all hues and shades may be 
produced by properly mingling three primary colors, 
diluted or darkened with white or black. The colors 
which he judged to be primary are red, green, and 
violet. The second field of his research was that 
of Molecular Physics. In this he studies the be- 
havior of particles of matter when, after being 
formed by chemical union, they were subject to the 
control of physical forces, especially when forming 
the substance of gases and vapors. A gaseous body 
consists of atoms, simple or chemically compounded, 
united in minute molecular masses, elastic, and mov- 
ing constantly, at high velocities, in all directions, 
in lines normally straight but subject to modifica- 
tions by mutual inter-influence. These conditions 
submit to the most rigorous mathematical analyses. 
From them arise gaseous elasticity, pressure upon 
enclosing surface, heat, and kinetic energy. Of col- 
lateral significance, though anterior in point of time, 
was Maxwell's discussion of the constitution of the 
rings of Saturn as consisting of streams of separate 
material masses, relatively small, moving in con- 
stant procession in a common orbit about the cen- 
tral planet. His greatest achievement, however, 
was his Theory of Electricity and Magnetism, a 
theory of great potency as the foundation of the 
intense activity of modern electric development, and 
opening electric science to interpretation by exact 
mathematical formulae. His fundamental hypoth- 
esis is that there exists in a magnetic field a con- 
tinuous rotation of molecules about the lines of mag- 
netic force ; and that their movement constitutes an 
electric current. He says : " I think we have good 
evidence for the opinion that some phenomenon of 
rotation is going on in the magnetic field, that this 
rotation is performed by a great number of very 
small portions of matter, each rotating on its own 
axis, this axis being parallel to the direction of the 
magnetic force, and that the rotations of these dif- 
ferent vortices are made to depend on one another 
by means of some kind of mechanism connecting 
them. Magnetic force is the effect of the centri- 
fugal force of the vortices. Electro-magnetic induc- 
tion of currents is the effect of the forces called into 
play when the velocity of the vortices is changing. 



Electromotive force arises from the stress on the 
connecting mechanism. Electric displacement arises 
from the elastic yielding of the connecting mechan- 
ism." Space will not permit the pursuit of this 
subject into even its nearer phases and relationships. 
But the outcome of the whole may briefly be ex- 
pressed by saying of Magnetism and Electricity 
what Tyndall and Joule said of Heat, that they are 
Modes of Motion ; from which statement one more 
readily comprehends the evidently intimate relation- 
ship between these physical activities and those 
which we denominate Heat and Light. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. issue 

Three new volume* three n(JW vo l umes in continuation of 

of popular science. ,. _ .,.. ,-, 

their "International Scientific Se- 
ries " of popular monographs. The first is by Pro 
fessor Marey of the College of France, and is en- 
titled " Movement." The movements of men and 
animals were first critically observed by Muybridge. 
He arranged elaborate apparatus to take a series of 
photographs showing the consecutive attitudes as- 
sumed by a moving animal a trotting horse, for 
example at minute intervals during one complete 
cycle of motion. The results showed that the con- 
ventionally artistic trotting-horse usually drawn is 
merely an amusing fiction. Professor Marey has 
added a variety of ingenious and accurate methods 
of observation. By placing beneath a horse's feet 
air-cushions connected with registering apparatus 
by rubber tubes fitly arranged, the animal is made 
to show automatically, upon a continuous sheet, the 
beginning, duration, and end of every step in any 
gait he may be using. Bright points and lines fas- 
tened to the black dress of a moving man, and indi- 
cating the geometrical position of his limbs, prepare 
for a series of photographs that reveal the consecu- 
tive positions of those members in the full cycle of 
any movement. A photographic gun contains in its 
stock a series of sensitive plates ; the gun, being 
aimed at a flying bird, gives a series of negatives 
showing the recurring phases of its flight. Thus 
have the motions of many living things men, 
beasts, birds, insects, fishes, reptiles been observed 
and recorded. Apparatus is also devised for revers- 
ing the experiment, projecting upon a screen these 
views in such rapid succession as to make the con- 
tinuous motion apparent to an audience. " Ice 

Work, Present and Past," by Professor Bonney of 
University College, London, presents the latest dis- 
cussion of the work of glacial ice in moulding the 
earth's surface. The facts are presented clearly and 
concisely, and the conclusions are fairly drawn. It 
is probable, however, that some time will yet elapse 
before the last word is written upon a subject whose 
phenomena are so numerous, so varied, and so 
widely scattered, and so modified in time by other 

physical agencies. " What is Electricity?" is by 

Professor John Trowbridge of Harvard University. 
No question of physical science meets to-day such 
intense and persistent inquiry. The mind is not 
content with a definition which limits the concept

of a physical entity by a description of its activity, 
or a statement of its effects. We are not satisfied 
to say of Heat that it is something which causes 
certain phenomena. We desire to penetrate yet 
farther within the veil, and learn what causes Heat. 
Tyndall told us that Heat is a Mode of Motion 
demonstrating, rather, that Heat is an alternative 
of Motion ; that when an acting agency may no 
longer produce motion, then Heat may be gener- 
ated. Does this satisfy our inquiry as to Heat, or 
its essence? Professor Trowbridge's last word, 
offered as an opinion rather than as an assertion, 
appears to be this : Electricity is a periodic vibra- 
tion emanating from the sun and transmitted across 
the ether pervading vacuum which exists between 
us and that luminary, which, reduced to a simpler 
equation becomes this : Electricity is a Mode of 
Motion. And this leaves us as hungry as we were 
before. Meanwhile the phenomena of electricity, 
the earliest and the latest known, in all their bril- 
liant and bewildering transformations, are set forth 
in this volume in a manner most satisfactory and 
instructive. 

When John Richard Green published 
his "Short History of the English 
People," he said he had "striven 
throughout that it should never sink into a ' drum 
and trumpet history,' " a mere history of kings and 
conquests. Not every subsequent writer who has 
had similar ideas of the scope of history has been 
equally fortunate in expressing them. This is per- 
haps the most serious criticism which may be pro- 
nounced upon Dr. W. H. S. Aubrey's "The Rise 
and Growth of the British Nation" (Appleton). 
Dr. Aubrey even attempts to improve on Green's 
title-page, for he declares his three volumes are not 
only a " History of the People " but also " For the 
People." He opens his introductory chapter with 
a series of ingeniously balanced phrases in which 
he refers the reader who is seeking information 
about politics and diplomacy, " the doings of kings 
and cabinets," to the " works specially devoted to 
Court millinery and upholstery." Although he thus 
shows a quite proper contempt for many historians 
whose works The People as well as the aristocracy 
purchase, his own choice of material at times re- 
veals a curious notion of the relative value of facts. 
For example, after saying at the beginning of the 
chapter on Saxon Laws and Usages that charters, 
wills, etc., " furnish a picture of the domestic life of 
England," he immediately remarks, " Horseflesh 
had been freely eaten, but pork became the favorite 
meat." But the author's rather unhappy way of 
outlining the province of history does not seriously 
diminish the usefulness of his work as a repository 
of information on a great many phases of English 
history. It contains much that the ordinary reader 
can with difficulty find elsewhere unless he has ac- 
cess to a library of special works. In this respect 
it reminds one of Mr. Traill's " Social England." 
Its narratives although perhaps these should be

called comments rather than narratives are evi- 
dently based on careful investigation and wide read- 
ing. Occasionally, however, events are referred to 
which have long since lost the dignity of facts. It 
is unnecessary to explain that there was no Prag- 
matic Sanction of 1268, or that Philip VI. did not 
owe his crown to the Salic law. The author's judg- 
ments, especially of kings, are often harsh. His 
contempt for James I. is unmeasured ; he calls 
Richard the Lionhearted a " butcher of men," " bold, 
reckless, coarse, and brutal; murdering hostages 
and captives by hundreds, in sheer wantonness, deaf 
to pity, to mercy," etc., and speaks of the compan- 
ions of William the Conqueror as " banditti," "harp- 
ies," and the like. The usefulness of the book is 
enhanced by a good index, a full table of contents, 
lists of books, and a chronological table. 

Messrs. Scribner issue a second vol- 
ume of essays selected from the writ- 
ings of Mr. E. L. Godkin, entitled 
" Problems of Modern Democracy." The papers 
in this volume are reprinted from leading maga- 
zines the " Forum," the " Atlantic Monthly," the 
"North American Review," etc., and are mostly 
of quite recent date. Some of the titles are : " The 
Duty of Educated Men in a Democracy "; " Who 
Will Pay the Bills of Socialism "; The Political 
Situation in 1896 "; " The Real Problems of De- 
mocracy," etc. With Mr. Godkin's views on pub- 
lic questions, and with his terse and pungent man- 
ner of expressing them, our readers are perfectly 
familiar ; and we need only say that the present 
volume shows the author at his best being agree- 
ably free from a certain note of " cocksureness," 
and a tendency to carp unduly at the peculiarities 
of his adopted country, which sometimes render his 
more ephemeral writings more irritating than con- 
vincing to the readers who most need to profit by 
them. Of course, the proximity of Tammany is not 
a thing to sweeten Mr. Godkin's temper or mollify 
his journalistic style ; and allowance must be made 
for it. The essays before us are serious and well- 
considered, and deserve altogether their present 
more permanent setting ; but we regret that Mr. 
Godkin's remarks (written in the heat of the mo- 
mentous campaign just past) on "the attitude of 
the West toward the East " were not revised before 
reprinting. He broadly asserts (on grounds inscru- 
table to us, and our experience of the section of 
country in question is at least equal to Mr. God- 
kin's) that there is in the West " a widespread dis- 
like or distrust of the East "; that " it is difficult to 
persuade him [the Western man] that a well-dressed 
man with superfine manners does not cherish evil 
designs of some sort "; and that " he does not see 
how the great fortunes he hears of in the East have 
been honestly acquired, and he, therefore, would 
hear with equanimity of the bombardment of East- 
ern cities," All this the writer says without the 
shadow of a smile. Comment is superfluous ; but 
one would really like to know the source of this

amazing concept of " the Western man." Were the 
supposition not irreverent, we should suggest that 
someone had been " stuffing " Mr. Godkin. In the 
main, the book is worth reading and re-reading ; 
and it should repeat the success of its lighter and 
more diversified predecessor. 

The methods and Mr - Frank Cramer's volume entitled 
characteristics " The Method of Darwin " ( Mc- 
of Darwin. Clurg) is at once a series of sermons 

for scholars on texts drawn from the life and work 
of Charles Darwin, a laboratory guide-book, and 
a treatise on educational method. The author de- 
fines education as the process of training the intel- 
lect in the art of reasoning; he regrets that the 
college curriculum fails for the most part to fur- 
ther that process, urges his conviction of the " su- 
preme practical importance of the direct study of 
scientific method," and shows how Darwin is a high 
example of such method. "His educational his- 
tory, his thoroughness, his scientific honesty, his 
logical power, his power of minute observation 
and broad generalization, the greatness of the prob- 
lems with which he dealt, and the profound influ- 
ence of his views upon the thought of the world, all 
conspire to make him a model in the study of sci- 
entific method." In two hundred and thirty-two 
very readable and suggestive pages, Mr. Cramer 
gives a careful analysis of Darwin's mental charac- 
acteristics and habits of scientific research, treating 
him as a type of what education should accomplish, 
and his method as one excellent means of training 
the intellect in the art of reasoning. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers of " A 
French Grammar," by Dr. Louis Bevier, to which 
Dr. Thomas Logic has contributed a set of exercises. 
The book is designed for older students and is thor- 
oughly modern and scientific in treatment. The same 
publishers send us M. CoppeVs " On Rend 1'Argent," 
edited by Mr. T. B. Bronson; and a volume of "Cop- 
pe"e and Maupassant Tales," edited by Dr. A. Guyot 
Cameron. The former of these two volumes departs 
from the conventional form in being illustrated, and in 
being printed in the style of a real book rather than of 
a school book. The same publishers also send us the 
" Cuore " of Signer de Amicis, edited by Professor 
L. Oscar Kuhns. 

The " Elements of Geometry " prepared by Professors 
A. W. Phillips and Irving Fisher of Yale University is 
based in its fundamental methods upon the books of the 
late Professor Loomis, but is essentially a new work. 
Its most distinctive feature is the series of photographs 
from models used in the teaching of solid geometry. 
For students of defective imagination these figures can- 
not fail to be helpful. Messrs. Harper & Brothers are 
the publishers. Other mathematical text-books just 
published are: "New Plane and Spherical Trigonome- 
try," by Mr. Webster Wells (Leach); " A School Alge- 
bra," by Mr. E. E. White (American Book Co.); "Ele- 
mentary and Constructional Geometry," by Mr. E. H. 



Nichols (Longmans) ; and " A Practical Arithmetic," 
by Mr. G. A. Wentworth (Ginn). 

The advocates of modern Greek in our universities 
have been making no little stir of late years, and a cer- 
tain demand for text-books has thus been created. Two 
such books have just appeared: " Modern Greek Mas- 
tery," by Mr. Thomas L. Stedman (Harper); aud "A 
Practical Method in the Modern Greek Language " 
(Ginn), by Mr. Eugene Rizo-Rangabe". Both writers 
are advocates of the teaching of Greek through the 
modern dialect, and Mr. Stedman makes, in addition, 
the novel plea that the language is well-fitted to become 
an international medium or lingua franca for the use of 
scholars in general. 

Besides the memoir of James Clerk Maxwell, noticed 
elsewhere in this number, another volume of the " Cen- 
tury Science Series " (Macmillan) gives an equally inter- 
esting account of the life of Sir Humphry Davy, by 
Professor F. T. Thorpe. Although not the founder of 
the Royal Institution of London, Davy was the first to 
give it a substantial impetus, by his brilliant career as a 
discoverer and lecturer, beginning in the early months 
of 1801. Davy's fame rests upon discoveries of which 
some were among the most startling in the history of 
chemical science. Among them may be named the 
exhilarating effects of nitrous oxide when inhaled; the 
isolation by electricity of the metals of the alkalies, 
potassium, sodium, etc.; the investigations of chlorine, 
fluorine, iodine, and their compounds; and the invention 
of the lamp, now bearing his name, which greatly miti- 
gated the dangers from explosive gases in mines of 
bituminous coal. 

Under the title "Pioneers of Science of America," 
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. issue a collection of sketches 
of the lives and scientific work of fifty noted workers of 
the last century and the earlier portion of the present. 
The list is headed with the name of Franklin, and 
includes such others as Audubon, Say, Henry, Morse, 
Erricson, and Agassiz. The papers have been prepared 
with care. Many of them have already appeared, under 
the supervision of Dr. Youmans, in the pages of " The 
Popular Science Monthly." 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons inaugurate an " Illus- 
trated English Library " of standard fiction with Thack- 
eray's "Henry Esmond," illustrated by Miss Chris. 
Hammond, and Kingsley's "Hypatia," illustrated by Mr. 
Lancelot Speed. In make-up the series is somewhat sim- 
ilar to Macmillan's " Illustrated Standard Novels," but 
the volumes are sold at a much lower price. The same 
publishers send us Carlyle's " Sartor Resartus," with a 
photogravure portrait from a painting by Whistler, as 
the first volume of their " Chelsea Library." As regards 
paper, typography, and binding, the volumes in these 
two series leave nothing to be desired, and are a marvel 
of cheapness besides. 

A " Deutsche Sprachlehre fur Anf anger," by Miss 
Carla Wenckebach, is published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co., who also send us two German texts: Eckstein's 
" Preisgekront," edited by Mr. Charles B. Wilson; and 
Gerstacker's " Irrfahrten," edited by Miss Marion P. 
Whitney. Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. are the publishers 
of Miss Hermine Sliiven's " Praktische Anfangsgriinde," 
a very elementary book. From Messrs. Ginn & Co. we 
have a volume of " Morceaux Choisis " from the writ- 
ings of M. Jules Lemaitre, edited by Mile. Rosine 
Melle"; and from the American Book Co. a "Second 
Year in French," by M. L. C. Syms.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" Mark Twain " is to stay in London this winter, and 
work upon a new book of travels. 

M. Daudet's " Robert Helmont " is the latest addi- 
tion to the Dent-Macmillan edition of that author's 
works. 

Ovanes Khan Messian, court translator to the Shah 
of Persia, is engaged upon an Armenian version of 
Shakespeare. 

It is said that the MSS. left by Sir Richard Burton 
contain materials for seven or eight volumes, one of 
which is now in preparation. 

The " Handbook of Graduate Courses" for the current 
year, published by Messrs. Leach, Shewell, & Sanborn, 
gives full lists of graduate courses in twenty-four lead- 
ing institutions, with much further information of value 
to the student. The price is only thirty cents. 

The Turnbull Lectures for 1897 will be given by M. 
Ferdinand Brunetiere upon the subject of French poetry. 
The titles run from " La Poe"sie Epique du Moyen Age " 
to " Le Symbolisme et les Tendences Actuelles de la 
Poe'sie." The first lecture is announced for March 15, 
and the last for April 22. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. have just published a 
new edition, in two volumes, of Nuttall's " Popular 
Handbook of the Ornithology of Eastern North Amer- 
ica." Mr. Montague Chamberlain is the editor, and has 
added some facts not included in his previous edition 
of 1891. The volumes have many illustrations, among 
which are twenty beautifully-colored plates. 

" A Second Century of Charades," by Mr. William 
Bellamy, is published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co. These publishers also send us four new volumes 
in their beautiful " Riverside " edition of Mrs. Stowe's 
writings. " Household Papers and Stories" and " Stories, 
Sketches, and Studies," are two of the volumes; the 
other two contain " Dredand Other Anti-Slavery Tales." 

The November number of our progressive Chicago 
contemporary, " The Inland Printer," presents the first 
of a series of cover designs in color, by Mr. J. C. Lyden- 
decker, the artist who lately won the " Century " prize 
for poster designs. The " Inland Printer " is an admir- 
able publication of its class, and under the enterprising 
editorship of Mr. A. H. McQuilkin it has gained a dis- 
tinction far beyond that of the ordinary craft journal. 

The Ode'on at Paris has planned a series of fifteen 
afternoon performances of classical drama, to be divided 
equally between works of antiquity, of early French lit- 
erature, and of foreign literature. For the first five 
matinees the plays selected are " The Persse," " Philoc- 
tetes," an arrangement of the " Ion " of Euripides, the 
" Plutus " of Aristophanes, and the " Phormio " of Ter- 
ence with the " Trinummus " of Plautus in a double bill. 

The " National Review " is to be given something of 
an international character, its publisher, Mr. Edward 
Arnold, having now a New York as well as a London 
office. The editor, Mr. L. J. Maxse, has been spending 
some time in America, studying the political problem 
and others involved in the late election, and arranging 
for articles from this side. The " National " is an ably- 
edited and a well- written review, devoted to the serious 
discussion of vital questions of current affairs. 

Professor Sloane's " Life of Napoleon," which has 
been the leading feature of " The Century " magazine 
for the past year, is now to be given to the public in a 
form of unusual sumptuousness, in twenty-two parts of 



forty-eight pages each. The scheme of color-printing 
(by a new process) will make this work unique among 
illustrated books; it includes reproductions, in their 
original colors, of eighty-eight masterpieces of Napo- 
leonic portraits and battle-scenes, besides over two hun- 
dred full-page engravings in tint and in black and white. 
The work will be noticed more at length in its proper 
place in our Holiday review. It is published by the 
Century Co., and sold by subscription only; Messrs Mc- 
Donnell Brothers, 279 Dearborn st., being the general 
agents for it in the West. 

Professor Gustav E. Karsten, head of the German 
department in the University of Indiana, has during the 
ten years of his residence in this country been making a 
reputation that gives him a high place among American 
philologists. He in about to undertake the publication 
of " The American Journal of Germanic Philology," 
and, that it may become a bond between the philologists 
of America and of Europe, he has associated with him as 
co-editor, Professor Georg Holz of the University of 
Leipzig. Although English and German will be given 
most attention, kindred subjects will receive appropriate 
consideration. The leading principles of the " Journal " 
are to be sound and helpful criticism, and the absence 
of all unscientific bias. The reviews will give an ac- 
count of all important work done in the field of Ger- 
manic philology, and at first these will be retrospective 
so that a brief history of the various topics may be pre- 
sented to the readers. Six numbers will be issued dur- 
ing the year, and the price is two dollars.

THE LIFE OF JOHN WELLBORN ROOT. 

By HAKKIET MONROE. With a Portrait and many Illustrations. 1 vol., 8vo, $6.00, net. [Ready Nov. 25.~\ 
In some important respects the same kind of interest attaches to Mr. Root as to H. H. Kichardson. 
Both were highly successful architects, who stamped their genius on American architecture ; and hoth 
were cut short in the midst of great careers. Mr. Root's field of labor centred in Chicago, and his genius 
reached its fullest expression in the general plans for the marvellous structures of the stupendous Expo- 
sition of 1893. Miss Harriet Monroe, the poet-laureate of the Exposition, has told the very interesting 
story of his life, and has made free use of his essays, after-dinner speeches, letters, and other papers. The 
hook is fully illustrated with facsimile reproductions of Mr. Root's drawings, and with etchings and pen- 
and-ink drawings by Mr. Charles F. Mielatz of New York. It is brought out in a handsome volume, 
printed with great care, and bound in fitting style. 

THE MYCEN/EAN AGE. 

By Dr. CHRESTOS TSOUNTAS and Professor J. IRVING MANNATT. With an Introduction by Dr. DORPFELD. 

Large 8vo, profusely illustrated, $6.00. [Ready Nov. 25.]

discoveries made at Mycenae, with 150 illustrations.

MERE LITERATURE, AND OTHER ESSAYS. 

By WOODROW WILSON, Professor in Princeton, author of " Congressional Government," etc. 12mo, $1.50. 

This book may fairly be called a varied statement of the proper aims of literature and historical study, and 
represents both admirably. 

WHITMAN: A STUDY.

a tonic spirit. 

A SECOND CENTURY OF CHARADES.

Except " Uncle Remus " himself, no person has stepped out of old Southern life into literature quite so nat- 
ural and thoroughly representative as Sister Jane. The story is a notable addition to American fiction.

By JEANIE GOULD LINCOLN, author of " Marjorie's Quest." 16mo, $1.25.

is very readable.

HIGH COMMENDATION 

FROM THE 

EDINBURGH REVIEW. 



Journal of 
Countess Prancoise Krasinska 

In the Eighteenth Century. 

Translated by Kasimir *D%iekonska. With a 

Portrait and other Illustrations. i6mo, gilt 

top, 17.25. 

This beautiful little book, the Journal of the 
great-great-grandmother of the present King and 
Queen of Italy, published last year, has been suc- 
cessful and has had a large sale from the first, 
but only gradually does its full beauty and at- 
tractiveness become known. 

In the July number of the old, staid, and most 
learned "Edinburgh Review or Critical Journal" 
appears a most appreciative review of the book, 
filling twenty-one pages, which begins as follows : 

" This curious little volume, the authenticity of 
which we have been at some pains to verify, comes 
to us from America, the only other translation being 
in French. In this, which is free and fluent, occa- 
sional expressions betray that Kasimir Dziekonska, 
if indeed a Pole, has lived and learned in the United 
States. But the task of rendering into another lan- 
guage the frank outspoken utterances of a young 
girl as frank in some instances as Marie Bash- 
kirtseff herself has been done, as it comes to us, 
with great success. The diary of a Polish lady of 
high degree, written a hundred and fifty years ago, 
could hardly fail to be instructive, as throwing light 
on the customs and prejudices existing in her coun- 
try at that time. . . . The book therefore has a 
double value. It is, first, a 'human document' 
delineating with extraordinary frankness the vanity, 
the ambition, the passion, but also the unselfishness 
and tenderness, which go to make up the remark- 
able character of the young writer. Secondly, it is 
a picture, Holbinesque in its fidelity, of the feudal 
state in which a great Polish nobleman lived in the 
last century, when elsewhere such conditions of life 
had long since become impossible."

300 THE DIAL, [Nov. ie, 1896. 




The Listener in the Town, and The Listener in the Country. 

By JOSEPH EDGAR CHAMBERLIN. Being selections from the " Listener " column of the Boston 

Evening Transcript. In two volumes, cloth, octavo, 75 cents each. 

For nine years the " Listener " column in the Evening Transcript has been one of the lit- 
erary institutions of Boston. The field of the " Listener " is a wide one, but his motif is always 
literary, and the volumes made up from his column have cohesion and a sustained purpose. 

" Have won a wide circle of readers and admirers." The Critic. 

"None of these charming, witty, bright-glancing sketches of Mr. Chamberlin's could have been lost 
without impoverishing the rare literature of the essay. ... Of the Listener it may be said that no 
individual in his field has surpassed him in freshness and in high average of literary value." Time and 
the Hour. 

Cinder=Path Tales. 

By WILLIAM LINDSAY. With cover design by JOHN SLOAN. Cloth, octavo, $ 1.00. 

In " Cinder-Path Tales " Mr. Lindsey has written stories of field and track which have 
technical consistency, and all the added coloring that a glowing imagination and a vivid memory 
of past enjoyment can give. He has succeeded wonderfully well in transferring to its pages the 
true atmosphere of the athletic field. Not alone the tangible surroundings of warm sunlight 
and free air, but its patient repression, its fun and philosophy, its disappointments and its glory. 

" Mr. Lindsey has put into these stories the crunch of the Cinder-Path, the very breath of the running 
track, as only an athlete could have done it. Tales which turn upon a race are common enough, but the 
author of the yarns in question tells them as such things really happen, not as a fertile imagination would 
naturally think they ought to happen for the purposes of literature." Boston Herald.

44 CAMPAIGNING WITH GRANT,"

teristic humor. The articles will be most interestingly illustrated. The series begins in THE CENTURY

A NOVEL OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, 

"HUGH WYNNE, FREE QUAKER, 

Sometime Brevet Lieut. -Colonel on the Staff of His Excellency, General Washington." 
By Dr. S. WEIR MITCHELL. Illustrated by HOWARD PYLE. 

This powerful novel, Dr. Mitchell's masterpiece, is a story of the American Revolution and of Philadelphia 
society from 1753 to 1783. Washington, Franklin, Lafayette, and other famous men, figure in it. It is safe 
to say that readers of this story will obtain from it a clearer idea of the people who were foremost in Revolu- 
tionary days and of the social life of the times than can be had from any other single source. It is not only histor- 
ically accurate, but it is a most interesting romance of love and war. The hero serves on Washington's staff.

HIGH COMMENDATION 

FROM 

Two of Great Britain's Chief Literary Journals. 



The Journal of 
Countess Prancoise Krasinska 

In the Eighteenth Century. 

Translated by Kasimir ^D^iehonska. Wit}) a 
Portrait and other Illustrations. i6mo, gilt 
top, $1.25. 

This beautiful little book, the Journal of the 
great-great-grandmother of the present King and 
Queen of Italy, published last year, has been suc- 
cessful and has had a large sale from the first, 
but only gradually does its full beauty and at- 
tractiveness become known. 



From the EDINBURGH REVIEW, July, 1896. 
Extract from a Twenty-two Page Review of 
this Book. 

" This curious little volume, the authenticity of 
which we have been at some pains to verify, comes 
to us from America, the only other translation being 
in French. . . . The book has a double value. It 
is, first, a ' human document ' delineating with 
extraordinary frankness the vanity, the ambition, 
the passion, but also the unselfishness and tender- 
ness, which go to make up the remarkable char- 
acter of the young writer. Secondly, it is a pic- 
ture, Holbinesque in its fidelity, of the feudal state 
in which a great Polish nobleman lived in the last 
century, when elsewhere such conditions of life had 
long since become impossible." 



From the LITERARY WORLD, London, 
Oct. 30, 1896. 

" How such a fascinating bit of autobiography 
should have so long escaped the present-day rage for 
memoirs can only be accounted for by the difficulties 
of the Polish language. . . . The narrative is inter- 
esting from the first page to the last, and though 
written in an artless, girlish style, shows the writer 
to have been a bright, intelligent, and observant 
young person. It gives a graphic picture of the 
manners, customs, and ideas which obtained in the 
Poland of the eighteenth century. . . . We com- 
mend this little volume as a delightful peep into the 
domestic life of a country little known in the days 
of its independence. It would make a charming 
present for young girls."

Works of Meissonier have commanded widespread popular appreciation. His military 
subjects have appealed to that inexhaustible interest in everything pertaining to the great 
Napoleon; while his genre pieces charm by their extraordinary delicacy and elaboration, as 
well as by the stories which they tell. This magnificently illustrated volume reveals the great 
painter in a new light as an art critic and theorist. The extracts from his letters and conver- 
sations which form the basis of the second half of the volume will enable the connoisseur to 
appreciate the definite, not to say dogmatic, beliefs concerning artistic subjects which underlay 
his practical activity. M. Gre"ard's treatise, therefore, will prove an addition of permanent 
value to the list of standard works in the field.

A Classical Encyclopaedia. 



HARPER'S ^DICTIONARY OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE 
AND ANTIQUITIES. Edited by HARRY THURSTON PECK, M.A., Ph.D., 
Professor of the Latin Language and Literature in Columbia University, City 
of New York. With the Co-operation of Many Special Contributors. With 
nearly 1^00 Illustrations, Maps, and Diagrams. Pages xvi., 1701. Royal 8vo, 
Cloth, $6.00 ; Half Leather, $8.00. 



This Dictionary presents within 
the limits of a single volume, in a 
concise and convenient form, and un- 
der one alphabet, the subjects that 
have usually been treated of in sep- 
arate works. Its topics comprise: 
Greek and Roman Antiquities (in 
the conventional sense of the term), 
Biography (including not only the 
personages of Ancient History, but 
also the great classical scholars, 
archaeologists, and philologists from 
the Renaissance to the present day), 
Geography, History, Literature, and 
Mythology. In the way of collateral 
information, much space is devoted 



to topics of the utmost interest to 
the student, which meet him every- 
where in the way of allusion, but 
which no single work has yet sys- 
tematically collected for separate 
treatment. Each important article 
gives a carefully selected list of the 
best and most recent works relating 
to the subject, thus directing the 
student to a fuller course of reading 
in English, German, French, and 
Italian. Illustrations, many of which 
were heretofore unpublished, and 
maps and diagrams taken from the 
most approved sources, are freely 
introduced. Important subjects re- 



lating to Antiquities are given not 
merely under their Greek and Latin 
titles, but under their English names 
as well, so that one who wishes to 
find a particular article and cannot 
recall the Greek or Latin name can 
turn to it in English and there find 
the reference to the proper title a 
plan which does away with the neces- 
sity of a set of cumbersome indexes. 
The Dictionary is in reality a con- 
densed Classical Encyclopaedia. Spe- 
cimen pages of this work will be 
sent to teachers and professors upon 
receipt of application by the pub- 
lishers.

EUROPEAN ARCHITECTURE. 

A HISTORICAL STUDY. By RUSSELL STURGIS, A.M., Ph.D., F.A.I.A., President of the Fine Art Federation of New

Honorary Member of the Mural Painters, etc. Illustrated with 9 full-page Albert-type plates and 257 engravings, many 
of them the full size of the page, and others printed in the text. 8vo, cloth, gilt top, $4.00. 

In this book on European Architecture, Mr. Russell Sturgis deals exclusively with the facts, as they are visible in each building to one who 
knows how to observe. The structure is described, and its meaning and the reasons for it sought out and explained, and the decorative treatment 
which arises from the construction, and which was, in a sense, inevitable, is analyzed. Then those decorative styles which have not arisen so 
naturally, and which are rather added to the building than an integral part of it, such as the ornamentation of the Imperial Roman buildings, are 
also explained and criticised.

BLASHFIELD. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" The ways of all wild living creatures have a fascinating interest for most children ; but unfortunately their parents and friends are usually 
too ignorant to answer their reasonable questions. To such inquiring minds, ' Tommy-Anne and the Three Hearts,' by Mabel Osgood Wright, 
should be a boon. They will hear the unappreciated garden snake's plea for toleration, and the mole's account of his own good deeds. They will 
have a peep into Bob-o-link's wardrobe and a glimpse of Madame Duck's nursery, and they will learn many surprising things about our small 
familiar beasts and common plants, which we all think we know. A pleasant thread of story binds together the bits of useful information, making 
them easier to hold, and the child who reads will be charmed, while he is instructed and led on to make new discoveries for himself." The Nation.

One of Mr. Swinburne's acutest bits of criticism lay in his remark apropos of one of Mrs Molesworth's earlier stories, that it is no whit easier to 
draw a lifelike child than to draw a lifelike man or woman ; and equally true is his further comment that " there is no one whose touch is so exquisite 
and masterly, whose love is so thoroughly according to her knowledge, whose bright and sweet invention is so fruitful, so truthful, or so delightful 
as Mrs. Molesworth. "

THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. 

In one of the most exquisite symbolical tales 
to be found among American writings, Haw- 
thorne has dealt with the entertainment of 
angels unawares, emphasizing a situation as old 
as literature, as old perhaps as the mythology 
that lies back of literature in the childhood 
of the world. Readers of " The Great Stone 
Face " will remember how it was prophesied 
that the features carved in the granite of the 
mountains should one day find their counter- 
part in warm flesh among the inhabitants of 
the Franconian valley, and how the hero of the 
story, looking forward to the fulfilment of this 
prophecy, suffered repeated and bitter disap- 
pointment as one famous man after another 
failed to meet the test, himself all unconscious 
that a life of helpful toil and noble aspiration 
was gradually shaping his own features into the 
desired likeness, and his neighbors all unwit- 
ting of the fact that the long-heralded incarna- 
tion of the Great Stone Face had dwelt in their 
midst from his birth. It has ever been the 
fashion of prophecy, from the days of the 
Delphian oracle down to our own, to get fulfil-

ment in unexpected ways ; and it is possible 
that the Great American Novel, of which the 
appearance has so long been prophesied, may 
already have come into existence. Many an 
American critic, jealous for his country's liter- 
ary repute, and eager to assert the final eman- 
cipation of " these States " from all old-world 
tyrannies of the ideal, has sought to discern in 
the works of one American novelist or another 
the typical expression of a distinctly American 
civilization. But, unless all preconceptions 
based upon a broad survey of literature are 
misleading, we are forced to disallow the pleas 
of these over-zealous advocates, and to admit 
that we have not yet produced any novelist 
really representative of American society in the 
sense in which Balzac is representative of 
French, Thackeray of English, and Tourgue- 
nieff of Russian society. Original and charm- 
ing novelists we have, indeed, in considerable 
numbers, and they have filled our literary 
picture-gallery with successful studies of genre, 
and fragments of romance, and bits of quite 
praiseworthy realism, and fictions of character 
and manners in the greatest variety. We have 
also the full flower of Hawthorne's genius, and 
may rest assured that neither the art nor the 
depth of " The Scarlet Letter" will be far sur- 
passed by the best of those who may rise up in 
the future. But the Great American Novel 
must be broader in scope, if it cannot be truer 
in art, than this tragic idyll of Puritan New 
England, and so the title still seems to await 
its properly-authenticated claimant. 

Assuming, then, that the Great American 
Novel has not yet appeared, and that prophecy 
about it is still admissible, let us venture a few 
suggestions concerning its coming and its char- 
acter. We may safely say that it will not come 
with observation. It will not be heralded by 
the puff preliminary, nor will hosts of rival 
publishers struggle for possession of the man- 
uscript. When it is given to the public, we 
shall not be regaled with columns of ingenuous 
gossip about the personality and habits of the 
author, nor will advance extracts be scattered 
far and wide to whet the appetite for the whole 
magnum opus- It will be the book of neither 
the day nor the month. Its originality will 
puzzle reviewers, and, unable to fit it into any 
of their neat pigeon-holes, they will, for the 
most part, damn it with faint praise, or treat 
it with flippant contempt. We call to mind a 
novel published in this country about two years 
ago, which was accorded very much the sort of 
reception just outlined. If it did not exactly 



"fall flat" from the press, it at least aroused 
slight enthusiasm, and soon seemed to have run 
its course. Yet the position of the book in 
question has grown stronger from that day to 
this. With little help from the organs of pub- 
licity, it has steadily enlarged its circle of read- 
ers, and ten years from now will probably be 
reckoned among the noteworthy books of the 
quarter-century. We shall not name it, for it 
is not the Great American Novel, although it 
has some of the qualities which we expect will 
characterize that work when it appears ; but 
its history will help us to understand the man- 
ner in which that eagerly-anticipated produc- 
tion is likely to make its way. The Great 
American Novel will be borne to fame by no 
surface ripple of fancy, but by a strong under- 
current of intelligent appreciation ; it will not 
win its readers by wholesale, but one at a time, 
and each new reader will act as a new centre 
of propagation. When it has at last really 
found and won its fit audience, it will probably 
become the fashion also, and its name will be 
upon the lips of fools, for this penalty of genius 
is always exacted sooner or later. 

So much for the manner of its coming : let 
us now ask what the Great American Novel 
will be like. Since it is to be American, it 
must needs reflect the democratic principle 
upon which American society is organized. It 
cannot rely upon the artificial distinctions of the 
older civilizations to give variety to its charac- 
ters, but must fall back upon the distinctions 
of mind and heart that are inherent in human 
nature. In other words, it must command a 
deeper psychology than the European novelist 
needs to give interest to his book. Without 
being in any way polemical, it must be imbued 
with the passion of democracy, based through- 
out upon the stout-hearted conviction that de- 
mocracy is the only rational form of govern- 
ment, the only system of social organization 
that has logical finality. But this implicit de- 
mocracy which informs the book must be puri- 
fied from the faults and the excesses of the 
democratic spirit as now manifested in our 
national life. It must be a democracy that is 
freed from arrogance, that has substituted ideal- 
ism for its present dull materialism, and that 
has learned the lesson of reverence. 

We should say that the political motive must 
figure among the leading motives of the Great 
American Novel. Without being a political 
novel pure and simple, it must give adequate 
expression to an instinct in the possession of 
which even the Greeks did not surpass us, an 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



319 



instinct which is in the very marrow of our 
bones. It may be to superficial seeming a 
novel of domestic concerns, yet it must receive 
color and strength from the political motive, 
and thereby touch one of the most responsive 
chords of our national consciousness. Its eth- 
ical motives must be worthy of a nation whose 
civilization is based upon Puritanism, and 
whose history is a standing testimony to the 
assimilative force of Puritan ideals. It must 
give to social phenomena their true ethical 
rating, and exalt to use Schopenhauer's clas- 
sification " that which one is " above that 
which he possesses, or that which he appears in 
the popular estimation. It must make the 
reader feel how far the true aristocracy of heart 
and intellect overshadows all the sham aristoc- 
racies of wealth and of social position won by 
" smartness," that distinctly American vice. It 
must enforce but always by implication rather 
than precept the Goethean lesson that he 
alone deserves life and freedom who wins them 
day by day ; and the other Goethean lesson 
so peculiarly applicable to a country where 
degenerate sons so often take the place of sturdy 
ancestors that we must earn anew the inheri- 
tance left us by our fathers, if we would really 
possess it. 

That some such ideas as these should inform 
the novel that shall be a reflection of what is 
best and deepest in American life seems an 
almost inevitable deduction from our national 
history and circumstances. But the Great 
American Novel must be no mere setting of 
philosophical abstractions. It must, it is true, 
strike deep root in the soil that the centuries 
have prepared for our civilization, but it must 
at the same time be a concrete and vital pre- 
sentation of certain individual lives as they are 
lived, or conceivably might be lived, at the 
present day. Such a novel is under bonds to 
be an epic of individualism, for democracy, if 
it means anything, means la carriers ouverte 
aux talens, means the fullest opportunity for 
the development of the individual. Our imag- 
ined work must have a hero and a heroine, each 
a typical figure ; and it would be a fascinat- 
ing task to attempt their characterization in 
outline. But this task would savor of creation, 
and is not for the critic to assume. Yet we 
will go so far as to borrow from the poets two 
suggestions, one for the man, the other for the 
woman. Is it too much to say that Emerson 
adumbrated the hero of our search when he 
wrote the simple lines that stand as a motto for 
the essay on " Culture " 



" Can roles or tutors educate 
The semigod whom we await ? 
He must be musical, 
Tremulous, impressional, 
Alive to gentle influence 
Of landscape and of sky, 
And tender to the spirit touch 
Of man's or maiden's eye : 
But, to his native centre fast, 
Shall into Future fuse the Past, 
And the world's flowing fates in his own mould recast." 

And may we not fancy our heroine to be the 
realization of such a type as is foreshadowed 
in the closing pages of Tennyson's " Princess," 
such a woman as shall set herself to the hero 
" like perfect music unto noble words," yet 
remain as distinctly woman as he is distinctly 
man?

"INSANITY OR GENIUS" IN CHARACTERS 

OP FICTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Modern scientific men are gaining those great quali- 
ties of style which modern literary men seem to be 
losing the clear presentation of thought and the hav- 
ing thought to present. Dr. Lombroso's book, " The 
Man of Genius," is as interesting as most novels and not 
so obscure as many poems. It seems indifferent what 
view an author may take of life or human destiny, if he 
is only capable of grappling greatly with great things. 
Leopardi, for example, is so filled with enthusiasm for 
death and annihilation that his pages throb with the 
assurance and exultation of immortality. In a minor 
degree, this book, in spite of the trail of tragedy from 
cover to cover, is tonic and uplifting. 

Nevertheless, its argument seems open to exception. 
Its essential theme the near alliance of genius and 
insanity is, as Lombroso admits, a commonplace of 
the ages, and is best summed up in Dryden's couplet. 
But when Dr. Lombroso goes f uther and seeks to prove 
that hereditary weakness, degeneration, and insanity are 
the predisposing causes of genius, one must ask whether 
these things stop short with great men. 'T is a mad 
world, my masters; and I suppose everyone is acquainted 
with persons who have as many oddities as Johnson or as 
many vices as Byron. The diseased conditions are not 
noticed in ordinary persons, but genius is like an illum- 
inated house which reveals all that is within. Then, too, 
the possession of genius widens its owner's sphere of 
action. It gives the right of eminent domain over men 
and women, and power tends to insanity and crime. 

Signer Lombroso does not give us any standard of the 
normal man. " The normal man eats and works," is the 
brief sentence in which he dismisses that inquiry. This 
is hardly as illuminative as Diogenes's lantern. The 
absolutely sound, healthy, sane man is questionably ex- 
istent. It would seem, indeed, as if the great organs 
of the body the brain, heart, lungs, stomach, etc. 
were like a group of wild animals imprisoned in one 
cage, they may, indeed, live together in peace and 
harmony, but they are more likely to rise and rend and 
devour each other. 

It is probable that all the symptoms of melancholy, 
megalomania, folie du doute, and the others upon which 



320 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



Dr. Lombroso relies in his diagnosis of degeneration, 
insanity, and genius, are present more or less in most 
human beings. It would be a delicate task to bring 
such an inquiry into the field of one's acquaintance, and 
might provoke reprisal; but it is open to apply Dr. 
Lombroso's method to fictitious characters to those 
accepted pictures of human life which we call novels. 
Running over in my mind a list of great novels, I can 
hardly recall one whose dramatis personce are not char- 
acterized by the symptoms which Lombroso attributes 
to genius or insanity. In this point of view, " Wilhelm 
Meister " is the record of a lunatic asylum, the types 
varying from Wilhelm himself a specimen of the 
folie du doute, or else a mattoid, a being with the ap- 
pearance without the reality of genius, to an example 
of melancholia in Mignon, of complete dementia in the 
harper, of characterlessness, vanity, vagabondage in 
the players, and of sexual abandonment in the women 
generally. Or to take "Pride and Prejudice," Darcy 
was apparently not suspected of either genius or insanity ; 
yet a more monumental instance of megalomania could 
hardly be selected from Dr. Lombroso's collection; and 
Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine de Burgh are comic 
variations of the same type. In fact, either in art or 
life, the only way a character can define itself is by some 
originality, exceptionality, or eccentricity, which must 
lay it open to the suspicion of the specialist. 

One comes to doubt, in the end, the methods of the 
specialist in every line. While they concentrate their 
attention on symptoms or types, all the rest of nature 
disappears or wears the livery of their theory. In the 
present case, the method and not the man is at fault. 
Signer Lombroso is modest, brilliant, learned. In his 
preface he even hints a doubt as to the value of his own 
investigations. And certainly it seems that the cata- 
loguing of craniums and the tabulation of thumb-marks 
comes to little in explanation of the cause or course of 
ge niu s- C. L. MOORE.

A QUESTION OF BOUNDARIES IN FICTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The Venezuelan question being amicably settled, and 
a fresh set of resolutions launched at the Turks, is not 
this a fitting moment to consider the correct boundary 
lines between the unsurveyed domain of no-man's-land, 
where an author may hunt unchallenged the small game 
with which he fills his bag, and those sacred purlieus, 
hedged in by divine sanction, within which his industry 
becomes unlawful poaching ? 

Has the public any rights which an author is bound 
to respect, and vice versa ? Must a good story be located 
in a region unknown to fame, lest its genial laugh at 
the common foibles of mankind be construed as a per- 
sonal affront by the dwellers in South Africa ? Just 
what is the sesthetic distinction between allowable and 
slanderous adjectives ? When does the use of " narrow- 
ness," for instance, become an actionable offence, call- 
ing for apologetic withdrawal ? Shall Mr. Henry James 
and Mr. William Dean Howells satirize the traditions 
of Beacon Street and blue-blood in a half score of novels; 
shall Holmes and Hawthorne, Lowell, and Emerson, be 
accused of the " narrowness of the moral " from the 
very seats of the mighty, and may not an unknown 
weaver of tales whose insignificance is proven by the 
assertion that the prominent citizen has been unable to 
find out " who she is " may not this wholly irrespon- 
sible person venture to insinuate that there are undesir- 



able neighborhoods even in South Boston ? Actually, 
the delightful chaperon of the " Little Fool " insinuated 
nothing, in quoting the current opinion of one suburb 
against another Jamaica Plain against South Boston 
quite in the self-gratulatory way of the Vermont 
countryman who pitied the inhabitant of the Hub for 
living " so fur off." The satire, such as it is, seems to 
be entirely against the complacent residents of Jamaica 
Plains for their assumed superiority to the rest of the 
world. It is they who are inferentially " narrow," and 
it would seem quite in order for them to rise and pro- 
test, in the name of the " middle age of American archi- 
tecture " and the " great-aunt who had lost the use of 
her mind." But let them beware of demanding an 
apology. Apologies are notoriously kittle cattle to 
bring home, especially when acquired by the argument 
of the bayonet. May one suspect the editor of " The 
Century " of that satire of which the dwellers in South 
Boston object to being made " targets," when he " sin- 
cerely regrets that the story should have been in any 
way misunderstood " ? The obtuseness of the human 
mind is always a subject of regret to the enlightened 
observer of his race, but why should he feel bound to 
apologize for it ? One is reminded of the ingenious 
phraseology by which the lawyer cleared himself of con- 
tempt of court: "I am charged with saying that your 
honor was ignorant of law: it is true: I am sorry for it." 

It may be recalled that some Cape Cod folk once 
objected, to the extent of a lawsuit, at having greatness 
thrust upon them; and the only conceivable reason why 
Miss Mary E. Wilkins is not crushed under indignant 
protests is that so few of us have the ability to see our- 
selves as others see us. A New England woman, who 
seemed to have stepped bodily out of one of Miss Wil- 
kins's sketches, and who had rambled on in the most 
delightful fashion with her reminiscences of " folks she 
used to know down Hilbro' way," who might have been 
the originals of " Lucinda Moss " and " Malvina Jen- 
nings," insisted that such stories were false and mislead- 
ing, and ought to be " kep' out of print." E. H. M. 

Chicago, Nov. 18, 1896. 

HAMERTON'S VIEW OF ART-TECHNIQUE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The extended and sympathetic review of Philip 
Gilbert Hamerton's Autobiography, in your last issue, 
recalled to me some correspondence I had with him a 
few years since; and in one letter, headed Autun, France, 
Dec. 20, 1890, I find the following interesting opinion 
on some matters of high importance : " I have always, 
for my part, regretted the extreme domination of tech- 
nique in the fine arts. The greatest intellect without it 
is nothing in the estimate of artists, and the most mind- 
less work with it is admitted into all exhibitions. If, 
however, you take up the study of art on the intellectual 
side, I fear it must be admitted that the intellectual 
interest of art is exceedingly unequal and often even 
wanting altogether. Critics often put mind into art, or 
suppose mind for it, when there is very little mind in it 
really." 

While Mr. Hamerton was not, perhaps, a genius, he 
was certainly a man of the highest talents, improved to 
the utmost; and his clear exposition and sane criticism 
have been most beneficent. I have to acknowledge my 
great debt to his works, not merely for an insight into 
art, but for a model of a genuine, thoughtful, and can- 
did spirit. HIRAM M. STANLEY.

A GERMAN LECTURE ON LITERA TURE. 



It was near the beginning of the semester, and 
after four months of hard work on the German lan- 
guage I was rejoicing in the fact that the lectures 
had begun. I had entered with enthusiasm into the 
courses in literature and philology, and expectation 
was at its highest. Professor Langweilig I had long 
known by reputation, and had already heard once. 
To-day he was to give his second lecture in the 
course. I had been in my place several minutes, 
when the door opened, and the Professor, followed 
by the famulus, entered. As he approached the 
desk, the Professor drew a few pages of notes from 
his pocket. By the time he had mounted the steps 
he had fastened his eyes upon his manuscript, and, 
beginning where he left off the day before, he spoke : 

" Meine Herren : There are also several other editions 
that might be mentioned here. The edition by Lorenz, 
Berlin, 1887, might have been a good one, but it is ren- 
dered entirely worthless by the omission of a comma on 
page 241. The two English editions published respec- 
tively at London and Oxford have been the most popular 
ones in Great Britain for many years. Neither of them, 
however, has a complete bibliography, and the Oxford 
edition omits all mention of my work along this line. 
Both of them persist in using capital letters with the 
proper adjectives and take certain unjustifiable liberties 
with the text, and are therefore thoroughly unreliable. 
There are also several American editions, but all Amer- 
ican books are mere translations or weak imitations of 
German works. I have examined three of these edi- 
tions from the United States, one from New York, one 
from Boston, and one from Buenos Ayres, and find them 
of absolutely no value. 

" I have now reviewed at some length the various 
editions of the piece of literature which we are going to 
study during this semester. I recommend to you as 
being the most accurate, showing the latest results of 
scholarship, and as following most scrupulously the 
original manuscript, the edition of Herr Professor Doc- 
tor Furchtbar Langweilig, Leipzig, 1891. 

" As to the much disputed question of the authorship 
of this poem I can refer but briefly here. I have ex- 
amined the original manuscripts with a great deal of 
care and diligently collated them one with another. The 
only other edition that is based upon a microscopic ex- 
amination of the texts is that by Biedmann, Halle, 1878. 
Now Biedmann used an eyepiece of only forty diame- 
ters with his microscope, while I used one of sixty dia- 
meters. Furthermore Biedman took no precaution to 
have the air in the barrel of his microscope and the 
lenses of the same temperature with each other and with 
the surrounding atmosphere; in fact he gave no atten- 
tion to atmospheric conditions whatever. Consequently 
I have been able to make many improvements on the 
work of Biedmann and to correct some actual errors. 
After this minute examination of the text and an exhaus- 
tive analysis of all the facts bearing upon the subject I 
have come to a conclusion entirely at variance with those 
of former commentators. Briefly stated my conclusion 
iH this: There were three different authors who worked 
consecutively on the poem. The first, A, carried the 
work down to the middle of line 711, 

" * Anon out of the earth a fabric huge 
Rose like an ex-. 1 



The second author, B, who is usually spoken of as the 
author of the poem, resumed it with 

" ' halation, with the sound 
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet.' 
The work of C consisted in interpolating certain lines 
in Books IV. and VII., all of which will be pointed 
out as we come to them. There is also conclusive evi- 
dence that in Book I. A received assistance from some 
unknown writer on four lines, and in one of these lines 
it is almost certain that this unknown writer received 
some help from an outside source. These writers I 
shall designate as Al and Al'. But the whole subject 
of authorship will be treated fully in connection with the 
interpretation of the text. 

" Now, gentlemen, before beginning to read this poem 
I must caution you against one very grave error. Many 
people suppose even many English-speaking people 
that English is a Romance language, that is, that it is a 
descendant of the Latin language. Now, while it is true 
that there are many words of Latin origin in English 
(and you will find many of them in this text), yet it is 
not true that the language as a whole comes from the 
Latin. English is a Germanic language, or, as the En- 
glish themselves would say, a Teutonic language. The 
Germanic languages are, as you know, but one branch of 
the great Indo-Germanic family. The Indo-Germanic 
family is a division of the Worldo-Germanic ; and all the 
languages spoken in this world are but a part of the 
great Universo-Germanic whole. 

" The great questions of the sources of this poem, the 
history of its development, the life of its principal au- 
thor, the social and religious conditions which influenced 
him, all will be reserved for special discussion in the 
seminary. I may say in passing that I have discovered 
an error of one hour forty-eight minutes and thirty-two 
seconds in the date of the author's death, a full account 
of which discovery I shall publish in the next number of 
the ' Englische Studien.' 

" Now, gentlemen, let us pass to the text. 

" ' Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit 

Of that forbidden tree,' etc. 

In the first line we have two words of Romance origin, 
disobedience and fruit. Observe the negative force of 
the prefix dis-. The word fruit goes back through the 
French of the Latin fructus. In pronouncing Latin we 
Germans pronounce by the Roman method. The pro- 
nunciation of Latin in other countries is largely influ- 
enced by that of the languages spoken in those coun- 
tries, but in Germany we pronounce it exactly as it was 
pronounced in Rome in the days of Cicero. Forbidden 
notice the force of the prefix for-; it corresponds to the 
German ver-, Gothic fra-." 

At this point in Professor Langweilig's discourse 
I perceived that his monotonous voice and learned 
lecture were having their effect upon me, and the 
last words that I distinctly remember were some 
remarks on Death in the third line. 

The sounding of the gong at the end of the hour 
awoke me. The Professor had reached the phrase, 
" Siloa's brook that flow'd fast by the oracle of God," 
and I caught his last comment, "Fast, adverb, Ger- 
man schnell, English rapidly" The Professor dis- 
appeared. The class arose to depart. As we passed 
out the door I heard a young man remark, " Er ist 
sehr interessant," and his comrade replied, " Sehr 
geistreich." CALVIN S. BROWN.

THE BEST OF THE NAPOLEONIC MEMOIRS.* 

We are inclined to endorse the opinion of 
the translator of Baron Thiebault's Memoirs, 
Mr. Arthur John Butler, that the work is, all 
in all, the best of the crop of previously unpub- 
lished memoirs brought to light by the recent 
Napoleonic "boom." It is at all events the 
freshest of them, the narrator confining himself 
closely to the diversified story of his own career, 
which is as absorbing as a novel of Dumas or 
Lever. If Thiebault lacks the philosophic mind 
and political prestige of Pasquier, he easily sur- 
passes the Chancellor in wealth of incident and 
descriptive point and color. Over the rancor- 
ous Barras he has the advantage of being an 
honest man. Thiebault, though his later ca- 
reer failed to fully justify its early promise, 
was a distinguished soldier and man of letters. 
He was a general officer at thirty, he held im- 
portant military and administrative posts in 
Italy and the Peninsula, his " Manual for Staff 
Officers" is still prized for its lucidity, his 
" Journal of the Siege of Genoa " and his " Nar- 
rative of the Campaign in Portugal " are stand- 
ard authorities for the events they relate. Thie- 
bault was, however, a disappointed man, and 
he makes no secret of it. One of his biog- 
raphers thinks that his superiority in culture 
and intellect to the rough soldiers of the Repub- 
lic and the Empire among whom he was thrown 
injured him by arousing jealousy ; his present 
editor attributes his comparative failure to " a 
certain want of self-control, especially where 
his affections were concerned," which led to 
frequent, if mainly trivial, acts of insubordina- 
tion. He was never a persona grata in impe- 
rial circles. A well-born, well-bred man him- 
self, the vulgar ostentation and caprice of 
Napoleon were distasteful to him ; and though 
he served the Emperor well so long as serving 
him meant serving France, he was never one of 
his adulators. 

In preparing his translation of these Mem- 
oirs, Mr. Butler has wisely reduced the five 
volumes of the French original to two repro- 
ducing rather fully the first two volumes (which 
treat of the period before 1800, and include 
the Revolution and the first Italian campaign), 
but retaining from the last three, so far as fea-

General in the French Army). Translated and condensed by

York : The Macmillan Co. 



sible, only the scenes in which Napoleon fig- 
ured, and those connected with the Peninsular 
War, in which Thiebault played a great part. 
The translation closes with the final exit of 
Bonaparte from the political stage though 
the author lived till 1846. 

Unlike Pasquier and Barras, Thiebault was 
never at the centre of affairs, strictly speaking. 
Politically he was a steady though moderate 
Republican, an abhorrer of the selfish conserva- 
tism at the one extreme, as of the wild radical- 
ism and bloody excesses at the other. He 
desired progress, and, like the best minds of his 
era (always excepting Rosseau, seul de son 
espece), he looked forward, and not back to 
remote antiquity, for humanity's Golden Age. 
But he was no "ideologist," in Napoleon's 
sense of the term ; and like a practical man he 
saw that the crucial problem of the time was to 
prune away with cautious hand the abuses and 
anomalies of the Old Order, without striking 
the knife into its sound and vital parts. Such 
was the policy of the statesmen who swayed 
for a time the Constituent Assembly ; but their 
voices were soon lost in the roar of the gather- 
ing tempest. The stars of Robespierre, Marat, 
St. Just, Hebert, were red on the political hori- 
zon ; for it was written that France must be 
purged by fire, before temperate words could 
again prevail in her councils. Of the stormy 
days in Revolutionary Paris, from the arming 
of the populace up to the massacres of Sep- 
tember, Thiebault was a witness at first a 
sympathetic, at last a horrified one. His account 
of those events is that of an intelligent, law- 
abiding citizen, without extreme prepossession 
for either faction ; and it may hence repay free 
quotation. First a word as to the author's early 
life. 

Thiebault was born at Berlin on December 
14, 1769, and in that city his infancy and boy- 
hood were passed. Military spectacles were 
rife there then as now ; and he recalls, not with 
unmixed admiration, the daily drills and re- 
views in the Lustgarten, etc. 

" In the city especially only recruits were assembled, 
and it was there that those terrible strokes with the 
cane, distributed with such inhuman lavishness, re- 
sounded on all sides. My father fled the place, and 
spectators would groan all save the ' Junker ' subal- 
terns, who seemed to be in training rather for execu- 
tioners than soldiers. Young as I then was, the recol- 
lection of these barbarities still causes horror to me." 

In 1784 Thiebault's father, noting that 
Frederick was failing, and seeing small pros- 
pect of employment under his successor, decided 
to leave Berlin. The journey to Paris was made 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

by private coach, and the author gives a lively 
account of his experiences en route. At Valen- 
ciennes, where a parade was going on, he had 
his first view of French soldiery a very dif- 
ferent body just then from Frederick's well- 
caned, well- set-up grenadiers. Says Thiebault : 

". . . For the first time I saw officers with their hair 
dressed in pigeon's-wing style, mounted on pattens to 
keep off the mud, and having umbrellas because it was 
raining a little, judge how I was astonished, nay, scan- 
dalized, when I compared this spectacle with that to 
which I was accustomed in the Prussian army, so severe 
in its bearing and so military to the smallest details." 

Paris was reached on the fifth of December, 
the author being thus nearly fourteen when he 
came finally to the city which was to be at least 
his domicile for the rest of his life. His expe- 
riences for the next four years, up to the dawn 
of the new time in '89 which ripened youth and 
rejuvenated age, were those of most young men 
of his years and degree ; and his account of 
them furnishes a sprightly sketch of the man- 
ners of the era. One day at Versailles he saw 
Louis XVI., who seems to have impressed him, 
on this occasion as on a subsequent one, as a 
mere boor, and a surly, ill-conditioned one at 
that, fitter to carry a hod than to rule a state. 

" As he passed in front of me one day on his way to 
hunt, he stopped to laugh with one of the noblemen who 
accompanied him; but his laugh was so loud and coarse 
that it was more like that of a tipsy farmer than of a 
monarch. . . . The Queen, whom I saw returning from 
Mass, had more nobility in her manner, and, above all, 
more dignity. But a white cotton gown, quite plain 
and by no means fresh, was not the dress in which a 
Queen of France should have shown herself in public. 
. . . But what did more shock me, nay, disgust me, were 
the remarks made quite aloud in the State apartments 
by some of the pages, the gentlemen of the guard, and 
some young nobles. Unseemliness reached the point of 
outrage." 

Thiebault saw Louis again a year or two 
later (the Bastille had then fallen and Mail- 
lard's Amazons had conducted " the baker, the 
bakeress, and the baker's boy " back to " his 
faithful city of Paris "), this time taking the 
air in the early morning on the Tuileries ter- 
races. 

" Just then a lady came through the gate. She had 
a pretty little spaniel with her, which, before she no- 
ticed it, ran close up to the King. Making a low cour- 
tesy, she called the dog back in haste; but as it turned 
to run to its mistress, the King, who had a large cane in 
his hand, broke its back with a blow of his cudgel. Then, 
amid the screams and tears of the lady, and as the poor 
little beast was breathing its last, the King, delighted 
with his exploit, continued his walk, slouching rather 
more than usual, and laughing like any lout of a peasant." 

Could that have been the amiable, if inept, 
Louis whom we seem to know so well, the 



" good, easy man " and well-meaning monarch, 
the passive martyr and scapegoat of French 
royalty depicted by compassionate history ? Is 
it not perhaps the real Louis (manifest for an 
instant under the flash-light of a hard fact), the 
nation's brutish " gros pore " whom the mob 
jeered at as he struggled under the hands of 
Samson on the scaffold in the Place de la Con- 
corde? Maybe the popular instinct was more 
than half right as to Louis, and (as Mr. John 
Morley thinks) as to Marie Antoinette as well. 
Thiebault undoubtedly relates what he saw ; 
and the brutal act recorded by him is quite in 
keeping with the wanton slashes of the whip 
(so unlike the paternal cuts of old Friedrich 
Wilhelm's rattan) bestowed by the " Son of 
Saint Louis " on the luckless priest or rustic 
who chanced to cross his path while hunting. 
The good Archbishop of Cambrai, who knew 
his man, once observed in company, on some- 
body's remarking that the King's kindness was 
" depicted on his face," that it was " a fortu- 
nate mask." Once more the author saw Louis, 
this time on his reentry into Paris after the 
flight to Varennes. He says : 

"The picture is always with me: I can still see on 
the back seat of the first of the two carriages Louis 
XVI. on the left, bareheaded, with Barnave beside him, 
while Marie Antoinette, on the right, held the Dauphin 
on her knees, and seemed to be showing him to the 
crowd as they passed through it to a palace that could 
in future only be a prison, and was in truth for them 
the anteroom to the Temple and the Conciergerie." 

Of the opening events of the Eevolution 
the emeute of July 13, the fall of the Bastille, 
the arming of the people at the Invalides, and 
the spontaneous formation of the civic soldiery 
Thiebault gives a rapid and graphic sketch. 
When the rioting began he joined the National 
Guard, Feuillants battalion, and was given a 
small temporary command. On the evening 
of July 15 he headed a detachment sent to 
Passy to reconnoitre the approaches on that 
side of Paris ; and on this occasion he was en- 
trusted officially with a letter from 1;he great 
Mirabeau, duly countersigned and sent by ex- 
press from Versailles, which he was to deliver 
at a certain house at Chaillot. The national 
crisis was serious. Paris was in insurrection ; 
Bouille, with the foreign troops, was hovering 
over her, like a hawk poised for the fatal 
swoop ; the clang of the tocsin and the roll of 
the drum hourly called the bourgeois from bed 
and counter to the ranks ; Saint Antoine was 
up in rags and what arms it could improvise 
or steal ; King Mob, long dethroned, was clearly 
coming to his own again ; society seemed fast

lapsing into chaos, and the young soldier nat- 
urally supposed that the missive of the great 
deputy and champion of the Third Estate was 
a document of importance. He proceeded cau- 
tiously on his way toward Passy, throwing out 
pickets as he advanced ; reached the house at 
Chaillot ; halted his men ; and delivered the 
letter. Judge of his surprise and chagrin 
when he discovered that the supposed state 
paper was only a billet doux to one of M. de 
Mirabeau's mistresses ! Thiebault with his four 
hundred men had been used to ensure the safe 
delivery of a note to a strumpet. He says : 

" I excused the fair lady from giving the receipt re- 
quired, declined the glass of wine which she offered me, 
drily ordered my lieutenant to return to his post, and, 
confining myself to a tone of cold politeness, left that 
merry company and continued my reconnoissance. . . . 
Some complaints of the office which M. de Mirabeau 
had made me perform naturally entered into my report 
and could not fail to enliven it." 

Thiebault witnessed the arrival of the Mar- 
seillese at Paris. Let us view that famous band 
through the eyes of a contemporary who had 
no special interest either in defaming or in ex- 
tolling it. 

" On July 30th those hideous Federals* spewed forth 
by Marseilles arrived at Paris. This invasion of brig- 
ands, which in March 1815 the Court of Louis XVIII. 
renewed in its own interest under the name of Ven- 
deans, definitely let loose the rabble and crime. I do 
not think anything more horrible can be imagined than 
those 500 madmen, three-quarters drunk, almost all in 
red caps, bare-armed and bare-chested, followed by the 
dregs of the people, incessantly reinforced by the over- 
flow of the Faubourgs of Saint-Antoine and Saint- 
Marceau, fraternizing from one grog-shop to another 
with bands no less dreadful than their own." 

On August 10, Thiebault was on duty at the 
Feuillants, charged by the Assembly with the 
protection of the prisoners from the fury of the 
mob. His temporary success (the prisoners 
were finally murdered to a man, and he " heard 
the crash of their corpses as they were hurled 
from the garret windows into the court below ") 
led to a highly dramatic scene. 

"Feeling sure that to gain time was everything, I 
was already congratulating myself on the result of my 
efforts, when a woman appeared in the courtyard wear- 
ing a black felt hat with a plume of the same color, 
dressed in a blue riding-habit, with a pair of pistols and 
a dagger in her belt. She was a dark girl of about 
twenty, and, with a sort of shudder I say it, very pretty, 
made still more beautiful by her excitement. Preceded 
and followed by a number of maniacs, she cleft her way 
through the crowd, crying, ' Make room ! Make room ! ' 

* Later on, in recounting his march with the Republican 
Army to the front, Thie'bault styles this order of levies " These 
scoundrels, who afterwards distinguished themselves by want 
of discipline, pillaging and cowardice, until the epithet ' F6d- 
trk ' became an insult that no soldier forgave." 



went straight to the other gun and leaped upon it. She 
was, as I learnt, Mile. Thdroigue de Me*ricourt. As long 
as I live that creature will be present before my eyes; 
the sound of her voice will ring in my ears as she uttered 
the first sentence of her discourse. ' How long,' she 
shrieked, ' will you let yourself be misled by empty 
phrases ? ' ' 

Naturally, Mile. Theroigne's harrangue pre- 
vailed. Thiebault was quickly hustled back 
into the guard-room, from which coign of van- 
tage he presently heard himself unanimously 
condemned to death by an improvised tribunal, 
the Mericourt presiding. He concludes : 

"I never saw her again after that day; but, though 
I am as susceptible as most men to the influence of 
women, I certainly never met another woman who in 
half-an-hour could have left on my mind a recollection 
of her which a thousand years would not weaken." 

During the domiciliary visits which preluded 
the September massacres, Thiebault narrowly 
escaped arrest as a suspect, which of course 
meant death at the hands of the paid butchers 
of the Commune at the Abbaye or at La Force. 
Thiebault did not himself see the massacres ; 
but he had some details from a young friend 
who did, M. de la Roserie. The latter went 
first to the Carmelites', where the slaughter of 
the priests was going on. Here two facts par- 
ticularly struck him : 

" The first was that half the assassins employed there 
were wearing the uniforms of the National Guards, that 
they began their work with the bayonet, and that they 
wiped their weapons dripping with blood on the leaves of 
some shrubs near the gate." 

The second fact is instructive as helping to 
explain why respectable Paris stood aside, and 
looked on with seeming apathy (very much as 
Christian Europe looks on to-day at the Turk) 
while this comparative handful of ruffians for 
five days carried on their work. 

" A man of middle age, whose face, manner, and tone 
were entirely calculated to inspire belief in his kindness, 
returning from his walk, with two young daughters 
going in front and his wife on his arm, passed near 
M. de la Roserie. They had no doubt just heard of the 
horrors which were going on at the Carmelites', and 
which, indeed, the frightful cries only too plainly re- 
vealed ; their faces showed great emotion, and yet the 
head of the family said to his wife with entire convic- 
tion, ' No doubt it is as sad as it can be, but these are 
implacable enemies, and those who are ridding the coun- 
try of them are saving your life and our poor children's 
lives.' " 

Of the murderers at La Force, de la Roserie 
states that, despite the great crowd of citizens 
surrounding them, they went about their work 
with the utmost tranquillity : 

" It would seem that they were some picked men of 
Maillard's band of 300, armed with long stakes trimmed 
so as to form clubs they were in truth the ' sloggers ' 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 




that they were called. Five stood on either side of the 
door of egress, hidden by the wall; as soon as the 
sounds announced that it was going to be opened they 
raised their bludgeons, and the moment one of the vic- 
tims came through the fatal door he fell with a smashed 
skull, and was dragged off by the cleaners-up." 

Thiebault concludes : 

" The original authors of those domiciliary visits . . . 
were Danton and Marat; but the hero of the atrocities, 
whose memory will ever be branded by the horror of 
mankind, was Billaud-Varennes. Hurry ing from prison 
to prison, wading in blood, he said at one place, ' People, 
you are sacrificing your enemies and doing your duty'; 
at another, ' Bring wine for the brave toilers who are 
delivering the nation from its foes.' Finally he had 24 
livres paid to each of Maillard's < sloggers.' " 

Such scenes enacted, Thiebault felt that he 
had " supped full of horrors "; and, shaking 
the blood-polluted dust of Paris from his feet, 
he started for the front a simple grenadier 
in a marching regiment. From this point on, 
his story is largely that of the professional sol- 
dier, and well repays reading. The volumes 
are well made, and contain several portraits, 
together with plans of Austerlitz and of old 
Paris. E. G. J. 



THE CASE OF CUBA.* 



Four centuries ago the prescience and the 
patient endurance of Christopher Columbus 
was rewarded by the discovery of Cuba. Chief 
of the chain which joins the two great sections 
of the western continent, and not far removed 
from the peninsulas of Florida and Yucatan, 
the island of Cuba dominates the mediterranean 
which it helps to inclose. Using round num- 
bers, its length is seven hundred miles, its av- 
erage breadth sixty miles, its area forty thou- 
sand square miles equal approximately to that 
of the state of Pennsylvania. Ridged with 
mountains that reach elevations higher than 
any of the Appalachians, and that divide into 
numerous valleys the area at their feet, it pre- 
sents enchanting scenery in endless variety. 
Lying just south of the tropic, its climate is 
warm but modulated by the breezes of the ocean 
and the gulf. Its mountains and valleys are 
clothed with perennial verdure that responds 
luxuriantly to abundant moisture and a stimu- 
lating sun. Its mountains are rich in minerals. 
Its forests of choicest woods are decorated with 
a profusion of splendid and fragrant flowers. 
Its valleys and plains produce plentifully sugar,

coffee, tobacco, and all subtropical fruits and 
vegetables. Cuba is by nature an earthly par- 
adise, fitly named " the Pearl of the Antilles," 
the rarest and the richest jewel in the diadem 
of Spain. 

Except Hispaniola, occupied but a few years 
earlier, Cuba was the first land in the new 
world to be colonized from the old. In the con- 
dition of a colony, without autonymous exist- 
ence, she has remained to the present day. 
Nearly an hundred years elapsed between the 
founding of Santiago de Cuba by Velasquez 
and the settlements of Jamestown and Ply- 
mouth. It was from Cuba that Cortez departed 
for his diabolical campaign against Mexico. It 
was from Cuba that Fernando de Soto set forth 
to find, not the fountain of youth which he 
sought, but the magnificent stream of the Mis- 
sissippi and an unrestful grave. But the settlers 
from England came to America to plant homes, 
and, as the sequel shows, to found a great re- 
public. The adventurers from Spain came to 
gather wealth which they did not expect to enjoy 
without returning to the mother-land. Even 
the government did not view the colony as a 
child whose young life should be nurtured for 
what its manhood might develop, but only as 
a source which might yield revenue for the 
crown and wealth for the subject. 

But in those days Spain had frequent wars 
with her European neighbors, and in all such 
wars remote colonies were especially vulner- 
able. It was vastly safer to send a marauding 
squadron down the Spanish Main than to sail 
a fleet along the English Channel. There was 
more opportunity for surprise, and a better 
chance for getting away with booty. Many a 
stately galleon, freighted with the wealth with- 
drawn from the Spanish colonies, became the 
prey of English or French ships of war, or of 
the wily buccaneer, who was either or neither 
as suited his convenience, but always an enemy 
of Spain. In such warfare, the attack, if not 
easily parried, is easily returned ; and so it fell 
out that La Habana, the chief Cuban seaport, 
was twice destroyed by the French and once 
taken by the English, and after each reverse 
was returned to Spanish authority. 

For generations the life of the Cuban was 
secluded and eventless. He had little education. 
He manufactured only such things as could be 
made rudely, on his own estate, to supply his 
own wants. He had no commerce, for his 
spacious harbors were sealed to all but Spanish 
ships, and Spain herself could take only a 
moiety of such things as he had to sell. The

restrictive policy of the mother country is illus- 
trated by the following : 

"During the years from 1726 to 1796, a great navy 
yard grew up on the bay of Habana, and 114 war ves- 
sels were built there to convoy the Spanish treasure 
ships. But the yard was closed, at the date last named, 
on the demand of the ship-builders of Spain that the 
work should be done in the mother country." 

A period of prosperity followed the restora- 
tion of Habana by the English in 1763. Trade 
was developed, especially with the neighboring 
United States, and the culture of sugar began 
to furnish an important staple of commerce. 
The negroes were induced to refrain from imi- 
tating the uprising of their race in Hispaniola. 
In 1808 the Bourbons were deposed by Napo- 
leon from the Spanish throne. In 1810 revo- 
lutionary movements began in all the Spanish 
dependencies upon the American continent, and 
in a few years those countries had freed them- 
selves from allegiance to the Spanish crown. 
During all these calamitous times Cuba re- 
mained faithful to Spanish rule, earning for 
herself the title of " The ever-faithful isle." 

Notwithstanding this, the authority then and 
since formally conferred by the home govern- 
ment upon the Captains-general sent to govern 
the island has been most autocratic and arbi- 
trary, including all the unusual powers "granted 
to the governors of besieged cities." Is it sur- 
prising that a continued policy of suppression 
should have been followed by a leaven of un- 
rest, constantly developing into insurrection? 
Since 1823 no less than ten demonstrations, 
more or less important, including the long 
struggle between 1868 and 1878 and that now 
going forward, have raised the standard of 
Cuban independence. Some of these move- 
ments were initiated within the island ; some 
were organized without ; but all rested upon 
the deeply rooted dissatisfaction with Spanish 
rule as administered. 

The careful observer readily discovers that 
these movements have not been inspired by a 
merely sentimental desire for independence. 
Until alienated by the long oppression of offi- 
cial misrule, the Cuban sentiment faithfully 
cherished a close and filial union with the 
mother-land. But even filial affection cannot 
survive a long series of grievances and unjust 
exactions. Some of the evils to which the Cuban 
objects are these : 

He has been compelled to pay a large, increas- 
ing, and unreasonable annual tribute to the 
mother-country. Spain is poor, and is stagger- 
ing beneath a debt so great that payment even 
of interest involves a most grievous burden of 



taxation. Cuba, Spain's richest resource, is 
required not only to bear the expense of her 
own insular administration, but annually to 
turn over to Spain a constantly increasing sur- 
plus. The revenue of the island in 1857 was 
eighteen millions of dollars ; in 1868, twenty- 
six millions, while the sum demanded of her 
was over forty millions. It was stated in the 
Spanish Senate in 1891 that the debt of Cuba 
was, in 1864, three millions of dollars, and that 
in 1891 it had become one hundred and seventy- 
five millions, not for anything that Cuba had 
done or suffered, but for expenses incurred by 
Spain herself in wars with Santo Domingo, 
Peru, and Mexico, in which Cuba had no imme- 
diate concern. At the same time, the national 
debt was twelve hundred and eleven millions, 
for which Spain was paying annually fifty-six 
and three-fourths millions, and Cuba ten and a 
half millions. The inequality is yet more glar- 
ing when we find that for $3.22 per capita paid 
by Spaniards $6.39 per capita was paid by 
Cubans. 

In the collection of this money the Cuban is 
compelled to pay heavy differential duties upon 
merchandise not imported from Spain. For ex- 
ample, when a barrel of flour, sent from New 
York to Spain and there " naturalized," would 
be delivered in Habana for $8.75, if shipped 
direct its cost would be $10.40. At the same 
time heavy duties are imposed upon Cuban pro- 
ducts sent to Spain. The excise and the duty 
upon Cuban tobacco have been so great as to 
cause Spain to take nearly three-fourths of its 
supply of tobacco from other countries. 

But the duties and other taxes are not hon- 
estly collected. Between the government and 
the taxpayer lies the official, whose purpose and 
practice is to squeeze from the payer a sum for 
himself which may be as much as twenty-five 
per cent in addition to what must go forward 
to the government, if not intercepted by defal- 
cation. This corruption is well known. In the 
custom house at Santiago de Cuba it is said to 
have absorbed as much as seventy per cent of 
the entire receipts. In 1891 the defalcations 
in the government of Habana were reported 
in the Congresso de Diputados, or Congress 
of Deputies, at Madrid as amounting to nearly 
twenty-three millions of dollars. In the spring 
of 1895 it was alleged that the custom-house 
frauds in Cuba since 1878 aggregated more 
than one hundred millions of dollars. 

The revenues when collected are not wisely 
expended. Public officers receive enormous 
salaries ; the Captain-general receives as much

as the President of the United States ; while 
the prime minister of Spain receives six thou- 
sand dollars per annum, the governor of each 
Cuban province has twice, and the chief eccle- 
siastics of Habana and Santiago de Cuba three 
times, that sum. All salaries, secular and eccle- 
siastic, are fixed at Madrid, not in Cuba. Ex- 
cept in rare and subordinate instances, the 
incumbents are Spaniards, fortunate friends of 
the home ministry, sent to the island as to a 
conquered and prostrate province, to enjoy the 
opportunity of quickly amassing a fortune. 

While the Cuban charges these evils to un- 
just administrative methods perpetuated by the 
mother-country, he is confronted with condi- 
tions, discouraging indeed, for which no gov- 
ernment can be made directly accountable. 
They result from the changing currents of trade 
caused by the world's march in invention and 
the competition of new industries developed in 
other lands. They become a factor in the 
Cuban's difficulties because they cause a shrink- 
age in his resources. 

The chief commercial staples of Cuba are 
sugar and tobacco. Within a brief period the 
world's production of sugar has been enor- 
mously increased. Of the product of 1894 
over eight millions of tons, of which one mil- 
lion tons was surplus more than half was pro- 
duced from the beet. The supremacy of the 
cane, and of Cuba, was overthrown. To meet 
the sharp competition, Cuba had increased the 
area of culture, had availed herself of improved 
methods of extraction, and had been compelled 
to concede a great reduction in price. The out- 
put of Cuban sugar had grown from 490,000 
tons in 1880 to 1,080,000 tons in 1893 ; dur- 
ing the same time the price of raw sugar Ccen- 
trif ugals) had fallen from $158 to $74 per ton, 
while the total annual return was in either case 
not far from eighty millions of dollars. Since 
then, both the output and the price have seri- 
ously diminished. Thus, it appears that within 
the last fifteen years the returns for capital and 
labor employed in Cuba in the production of 
sugar have been reduced about half. In like 
manner, the receipts from exported cigars fell 
in six years from ten millions of dollars in 
1889 to five and a third millions in 1894. 
Until the removal, quite lately, of the duty on 
sugar, the Spanish government has collected 
an export duty on both sugar and tobacco. 

The excellent and timely volume before us, 
by Lieutenant Rowan, U.S.N., and Professor 
Ramsay, of the Columbian University, presents 
a clear and judicial account of Cuba and its 



history, evidently the result of careful and 
impartial investigation. The conditions which 
they have described and the opinions reported 
as held by intelligent Cubans lead naturally to 
restlessness, remonstrance, and revolt. Provo- 
cations less aggravated led the Anglo-American 
colonies to assert their independence, and the 
Spanish colonies on the continent to imitate 
their example. The sympathies of the people 
of the United States flow perennially toward 
any race or people which struggles for freedom 
or autonomy. The interests of the United 
States would be better served by the presence 
in Cuba of a people peaceful, happy, self- 
governing, and prosperous, than of a populace 
enslaved, impoverished, and in revolt. It is 
certain that these are the opinions of many in 
our country who are not prepared to assert that 
the acquisition of Cuba by the United States is 
desirable even if it were possible. 

The earlier demonstrations against Spanish 
authority were only sporadic movements, symp- 
toms of fever which yielded to the prompt 
administration of a self -protecting government. 
The first genuine attempt of the Cuban people 
to acquire a national existence began in Octo- 
ber, 1868, with a declaration of independence 
made under the leadership of Carlos M. de 
Cespedes, who was soon supported by fifteen 
thousand men, more formidable for ardor than 
for arms. In April, 1869, a constitution was 
promulgated providing the usual forms of 
republican government, and an election was 
held. It is admitted that a greater part of the 
native and influential Cubans were in sympathy 
with the insurrection. The forces in the field 
were badly armed and poorly supplied. The 
Spanish gunboats patrolled the coast to pre- 
vent assistance from without, while the Spanish 
troops were equipped with the most effective 
munitions of war. In 1869 the insurgents 
were recognized as belligerents by several of 
the Central American States, but by none of 
the greater powers. In 1871 the contingent 
operating in central Cuba received favorable 
terms of surrender and laid down their arms. 
From then to 1878 a desultory warfare was 
carried on to little purpose on either side. 

The advantage to the Spanish troops in or- 
ganization, arms, and supplies was neutralized 
by the nature of the country in the theatre of 
action, where mountain fastnesses everywhere 
aided the wiles of the guerrilla, and by the 
disease-laden climate, fatal to the unacclimated 
Spanish levies. In February, 1878, the peace 
offered by Captain-General Martinez de Cam-

pos, with pardon to all who had taken part in 
the revolutionary movement, was accepted, and 
the war was closed. While this disposition 
was made of the forces that had actually borne 
arms, it is asserted that important reforms were 
promised to the Cuban people, as to the admin- 
istration of the island and the removal of the 
abuses which had been the sources of disaffec- 
tion. It is further asserted that these reforms 
were not instituted as promised, and that the 
abuses were continued without mitigation. 

In February, 1895, a second insurrection 
began. The first demonstration was made by 
some twenty-four persons in the province of 
Matanzas, acting in concert with other Cubans 
dwelling in the island or in exile without. The 
organizer was Jose Marti, then in New York, 
who was afterwards joined in Santo Domingo 
by Maximo Gomez, and with other leaders 
arrived in Cuba in May, when the conflict was 
fully arrayed. Marti was killed in battle, May 
19, and Gomez became the chief in command. 
The full significance of the uprising was not at 
first appreciated, because of the small number 
of insurgents in view ; but when its strength 
was recognized, General Campos, who by nego- 
tiation had ended the preceding conflict, was 
despatched from Spain to command the royal 
forces. His management of the campaign did 
not secure promptly the results expected at 
Madrid. He was recalled in January, 1896, 
and General Weyler was sent to succeed him, 
and is now in command. 

The war or must we say the revolt ? 
has been in progress twenty months. By March 
last, Spain had sent to Cuba 121,000 men, in 
addition to 19,000 garrisoned on the island 
when hostilities began. Constant reinforce- 
ments have followed, so that the effective 
strength of the Spanish army in Cuba is re- 
ported to exceed 200,000 men, splendidly 
drilled and equipped, a large proportion being 
veteran troops. General Weyler has also under 
his command a force of volunteers estimated at 
50,000, a coast guard, and a cordon of war- 
ships and gunboats patrolling the coast. 

The revolutionary forces are not so easily es- 
timated.* They are supposed to number 50,000 
men bearing firearms, with 25,000 more " mach- 

* Definite statements as to the population of Cuba cannot 
now be made, as the last census was taken in 1887, when the 
total was 1,631,687. The following are estimates for 1894 : 

Spaniards, or " peninsulars " 258,000 

Cubans of Spanish descent 1,000,000 

Cubans of other white or Asiatic blood 38,000 

Cubans of African blood, pure or mixed .... 431,000 

Total Cubans, or " insulars " 1,469,000 

Total estimated population, 1894 1,727,000 



eteros." They have lacked many things usually 
deemed indispensable to efficient warfare. 
Their base of action has been the mountain 
fastness ; for food, they have foraged as they 
went ; for arms, ammunition, and medicines, 
they have depended on what their coadjutors 
in other lands have sent by swift steamers that 
could elude the watchfulness of the patrolling 
fleet, or what they could themselves take from 
their enemy. They are said to be now fairly 
well supplied with small arms of improved pat- 
tern, and with corresponding ammunition ; with 
a small equipment of artillery ; with dynamite 
guns, nitro-gelatine, and stick dynamite. They 
are without horses, which is a serious deficiency. 

Hitherto the insurgents seem to have ar- 
ranged the fighting to suit their own conven- 
ience. They have been ubiquitous, swift, and 
elusive. They have avoided pitched battles 
with superior numbers. They appear suddenly 
where least expected, overcome whatever small 
garrison may be found, ravage cane-fields and 
sugar-mills with fire, dynamite, and the mach- 
ete, and vanish. The real object of such attack 
is the Spanish exchequer. The destruction of 
the chief article of export means not merely a 
loss of export duties, but a corresponding 
diminution of imports and of the imposts 
thereon. It dries a stream which, flowing into 
the Spanish treasury, would in part replace the 
sums withdrawn to meet the expenses of the 
war. 

The Cubans have utilized the delays of the 
rainy season by planning a civil government, 
and where possible putting it in action. They 
have seen that, while claiming the recognition 
of foreign nations, they must provide for recog- 
nition something more than an army struggling 
in the field. A president, Senor Betancourt, 
has been chosen, and cabinet officers have been 
appointed. Maximo Gomez y Baez is the 
general-in-chief ; Antonio Maceo, lieutenant- 
general. The island has been divided into 
states, districts, and prefecturas. Provision has 
been made for the collection of taxes, for estab- 
lishing roads, and for regulating marriages ; 
for better supplies of food for fighters and their 
families, and better care for the wounded. 

The next campaign will soon open, and the 
struggle will be severe and probably decisive. 
Neither party can endure defeat. It is not 
possible to predict the outcome, farther than to 
observe that the Cubans are contending against 
fearful odds. It is certain that the sympathy 
of the larger part of the American people is 
with them. SELIM H. PEABODY.

THE IJTERARY CIRCLE OF THE BRONTES.* 

" Charlotte Bronte and her Circle " is a new 
collection of the Bronte correspondence, ar- 
ranged and commented on by Mr. Clement K. 
Shorter. The collection is as complete as Mr. 
Shorter could make it, the greater part of the 
volume being made up of entirely new material. 
The editor has arranged this correspondence in 
chapters in such a way as to tell the life-story 
of Charlotte Bronte and her connection with 
her more intimate friends. He has shown so 
much discernment and discrimination in the 
execution of his plan that one dislikes to urge 
any objections to the plan itself. But I think 
it has some defects. This division of letters 
into chapters, for example, does not give as 
clear an idea of the development of Charlotte 
Bronte's character as might be had from a 
strictly chronological arrangement. Then, too, 
as the letters are arranged according to their 
contents, occasional difficulties arise in classi- 
fying them, particularly when a single letter 
contains important matter regarding two or 
more members of the Bronte circle, which can- 
not be wholly overcome by cross-references and 
foot-notes. Thus, some part of the interest 
that should belong to Charlotte Bronte herself 
is dispersed among her friends. In spite of 
these strictures, however, the book contains so 
much new material that it forms an important 
contribution to Bronte literature. The work 
should be of interest, also, to all students of 
that transitional period of English fiction of 
which Charlotte Bronte is perhaps the most 
modern representative. 

The circle of friends that gathered about 
Charlotte Bronte, to which so much of the 
present volume is devoted, was of exceeding 
small compass when compared with other lit- 
erary circles of this and preceding centuries. 
It included nothing of the talent and genius 
which assembled about Charles Lamb, and of 
which he and others of the impressionists wrote 
so pleasantly ; or about Coleridge, to listen to 
those wonderful monologues ; or even about 
our own Longfellow, when that poet was trans- 
lating the " Divina Commedia." These are 
charming chapters in the gossipping history of 
English letters. They suggest potent forces 
that have been, and perhaps are, at work in 
the development of literature, whose influence 
will last as long as literature itself. The greater 
part of what was thought and said at these

Shorter. With portraits. New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



gatherings can never be reproduced in any tan- 
gible form. Hazlitt attempted to reproduce 
one of the talks at the Lambs' in his essay " Of 
Persons one would wish to have seen," and with 
all his charm as an essayist he merely succeeded 
in suggesting to his readers how much he had 
omitted. In her own way, but to a less degree 
than any of these, Charlotte Bronte exerted an 
influence on those who met her and afterwards 
wrote to her. Many of these friends are no 
longer remembered. Outside of the members 
of her own family, all of whom had some talent 
for writing and one something very like genius, 
the intimate members of Charlotte Bronte's 
circle were Ellen Nussey, Mary Taylor, Mar- 
garet Wooler, and W. S. Williams. Friend- 
ships which did not ripen into intimacy were 
those with Miss Martineau, Mrs. Gaskell, and 
Thackeray. 

One of the most interesting of this circle 
was Charlotte's own sister, Emily, the member 
of the Bronte family who came nearest to pos- 
sessing genius. Of her real character we know 
very little ; but from a hint here and there in 
the Bronte correspondence, in her own poems, 
and in " Wurthering Heights," we gather that 
she was very eccentric in manner, that her 
ideas were theoretical rather than practical, and 
that she was characterized by an impenetrable 
reserve suggestive of great moral strength and 
much latent power. One of her friends de- 
scribes her as being " intensely lovable." " One 
of her rare expressive looks," writes this same 
friend, " was something to remember through 
life, there was such a depth of soul and feeling, 
and yet a shyness of revealing herself a 
strength of self-containment seen in no other. 
She was in the strictest sense a law unto her- 
self, and a heroine in keeping that law." Her 
death was marked by the same spirit of cour- 
age and endurance which pervades her poem, 
" The Old Stoic "; it was a relentless conflict, 
says Charlotte, between a fragile frame and a 
strangely strong spirit. In her life we are told 
that she loved the moors and found her dearest 
delights in the bleakest of solitudes. " Flowers 
brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest 
of the heath for her ; out of a sullen hollow in 
a livid hill-side her mind could make an Eden," 
writes her sister, and she adds that above all 
things else she loved liberty. It is this spirit of 
liberty which is present in her " Last Lines," 
and it is this intense personality which fills her 
best poems, and has left its mark on " Wur- 
thering Heights," that rude, rustic production, 
where it is accompanied by a weird power, and 



330 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



is brooded over by a spirit almost sombre 
enough to be worthy of the gloomy pencil of a 
Rembrandt. 

To all this, the plain personality of Charlotte 
Bronte presents a striking contrast. Her let- 
ters reveal a pure and blameless character, but 
one so simple, so unassuming, and so common- 
place, as to be unattractive. Now from a woman 
possessing these qualities, brilliant letters are 
hardly to be expected ; for to be a thoroughly 
good letter-writer one must have a certain 
Shandian disregard for form enough at least 
to free one's self from cold conventionality. 
Charlotte Bronte, in spite of a seeming and 
even professed frankness, could not overcome 
the self-imposed restraint that characterizes 
her letters, nor with her remarkable talent could 
she free them from the commonplaces of an 
uneventful life. 

Her letters contain some critical opinions, 
however, which are worth quoting, because they 
show that at times her mind was keenly incis- 
ive, although her education, her reading, and 
her travels were not extensive enough to give 
her that breadth of view so essential to the 
critic. These are, for the most part, judgments 
of her contemporaries. Emerson's essays she 
read with interest and admiration, but she 
found the gold mixed with clay. She said 
Leigh Hunt's writings resembled sunshine in 
their brightness and tranquillity. She admired 
the noble manliness of Carlyle, but disliked his 
style and often differed from his way of think- 
ing. She was pleased with Ruskin because of 
the beauty and energy of his style, and because 
he himself was such a hearty admirer. She 
thought Goethe " clear, deep, but very cold "; 
and in one letter she writes of him as " great, 
powerful, giant- souled, but also profoundly ego- 
tistical." She placed Thackeray above all her 
contemporaries ; but while she bowed before 
his shrine with an almost blind hero-worship, 
she was not unconscious of his faults. She 
came to the conclusion that " whenever he 
writes, Mephistopheles stands on his right hand 
and Raphael on his left ; the great doubter and 
sneerer usually guides his pen, the Angel, noble 
and gentle, interlines letters of light here and 
there." What she writes of Jane Austen is 
worth reprinting because it is the criticism of 
one great woman by another : 

" I have likewise read one of Miss Austen's works 
'Emma' read it with interest and with just the de- 
gree of admiration which Miss Austen herself would 
have thought sensible and suitable. Anything like 



warmth or enthusiasm anything energetic, poignant, 
heartfelt is utterly out of place in commending these 
works : all such demonstration the authoress would have 
met with a well-bred sneer, would have calmly scorned 
as outrd and extravagant. She does her business of 
delineating the surface of the lines of genteel English 
people curiously well. There is a Chinese fidelity, a 
miniature delicacy, in the painting. She ruffles her 
reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him by nothing 
profound. The passions are perfectly unknown to her; 
she rejects even a speaking acquaintance with that 
stormy sisterhood. Even to the feelings she vouchsafes 
no more than an occasional graceful but distant recog- 
nition too frequent converse with them would ruffle 
the smooth elegance of her progress. Her business is 
not half so much with the human heart as with the hu- 
man eyes, month, hands, and feet. What sees keenly, 
speaks aptly, moves flexibly, it suits her to study; but 
what throbs fast and full, though hidden, what the blood 
rushes through, what is the unseen seat of life and the 
sentient target of death, this Miss Austen ignores. She 
no more, with her mind's eye, beholds the heart of her 
race than each man, with bodily vision, sees the heart in 
his heaving breast. Jane Austen was a complete and 
most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather 
insensible (not senseless) woman." 

As a novelist Charlotte Bronte seems to have 
realized some of her limitations. In her letters 
she frequently laments her small knowledge of 
the world, which neither capacity nor circum- 
stance would permit her to widen. This, she 
claimed, prevented her from giving that import- 
ance and variety to her writings which were to 
be met with in the work of Dickens and Thack- 
eray. She did not realize that Jane Austen 
(whom she could by no means appreciate), 
laboring under the same disadvantages, had 
produced far greater results with material as 
scanty as her own. The truth is that Charlotte 
Bronte possessed talent but not genius. Fur- 
thermore, her conception of art was wrong. 
Of a certain character she wrote : " It is very 
masterly, because it is very true." She relied 
too much on autobiographical material, and 
therefore failed to idealize her characters suf- 
ficiently. She confessed that the Lowood scenes 
in " Jane Eyre " were " merely photographed 
from life," and by this plea sought to justify 
them as fiction. She might have said the same 
thing, with equal truth, of the greater part of 
"The Professor," "Shirley," or " Yilette." 
Beyond what was evidently autobiographical, 
she created only one character of any great im- 
portance Mr. Rochester of " Jane Eyre." 
Upon the creation of this character, and upon 
the fact that she anticipated some phases of the 
modern novel, rests her fame as a novelist.

A PANORAMIC HISTORY OF THE 
QUARTER-CENTURY.* 

The public is always ready to hear what 
President Andrews may have to say on history, 
philosophy, economics, school management, or 
any of the long list of subjects which he keeps 
upon his mental shelves ; but that personality 
of his which has been so prominent a factor in 
any estimate of his prior work must be elimi- 
nated in the case of his latest one, unless, indeed, 
the words " compiled by " should precede the 
author's name. The characteristic demand of 
the American for everything to be " up to date " 
is nowhere better illustrated than in this com- 
pilation of the most recent events in our national 
life, arranged in a semi- chronological order 
under the title "The History of the Last 
Quarter-Century in the United States." Some 
will be found to question whether the cover- 
title, which omits the words " A History of," be 
not the more nearly correct ; whether masses of 
detail " the rudiments of empire, plastic still 
and warm " can be caught up and moulded 
perforce into history ; whether a proper per- 
spective for discrimination and proper length 
of time for a crystallization of these historical 
atoms be not essential. 

Brought into existence by the enterprise of 
magazine editors and publishers who may be 
accepted as in touch with the popular demand, 
the series was awaited with a pleasant anticipa- 
tion due to its novelty, and was received with 
marks of approval. But the difficulties which 
lay about the magazine articles are even more 
apparent in book form: the unsatisfactory 
border-land between an essay on the present 
and one on the truly historical past ; the re- 
counting of what is neither newly-old nor oldly- 
new. One willingly listens to instruction and 
even persuasion upon the events of to-day, but 
upon those of the near yesterday he already has 
his opinion from personal observation. He 
does not wish to recall a mass of events cata- 
logued for each year, but will wait until hidden 
authorities have been revealed, until the evi- 
dence is all in and the popular verdict made up. 
No one, apparently, realizes these difficulties 
more than the author ; and in the preface, pre- 
sumably written after the articles had been 
gathered into their present form, he expresses 
only the hope that " precisely on account of 
their occurrence in recent time, the doings here

set forth will have a peculiarly living interest ; 
that the work may here and there rescue from 
oblivion some insignificant deed which would 
surely meet that fate were the recording de- 
ferred ; and that prospectors traversing this 
forest hereafter may get on better for our toil 
in blazing the path." But even if " state and 
private papers are needed fully to explain the 
acts of public men and the policies of adminis- 
trations," had half the minor events been re- 
placed by comments of Dr. Andrews, made 
after due digestion of the facts, the volumes 
would have promised more for the student. 
That, however, would have been fatal to the 
magazine purpose. 

Taking the work for what it purports to be 
and is a rapidly-moving and rapidly-painted 
panorama of the last quarter of a century, a 
framework written about a wealth of illustra- 
tion it must prove of interest to the general 
reader, and a mine of material for the Ameri- 
can " jingoist." The progress of political 
events, interspersed with the "heathen Chinee " 
and " Molly Maguires," is sketched very freely 
and very fairly, although necessarily discon- 
nectedly. Much of it is newspaper and pamph- 
let quotation, reminding one of the progressive 
country newspaper which deems it necessary to 
cull from its file and publish in the first issue 
after the opening of the new year a " resume of 
the chief events of interest chronicled in our 
community during the past year." " The Recol- 
lections of John Sherman " is almost the only 
authority given. Prominent characters of the 
period must be dismissed with a scanty line, 
although here the opinions of Dr. Andrews 
would be valuable. Of President Hayes, he 
says : 

" Partly the mode of his accession to office, and partly 
the rage of selfish placemen who could no longer have 
made their way, made it fashionable for a time to speak 
of President Hayes as a weak man.' This was an 
entire error. His administration was in every way one 
of the most creditable in our history. He had a reso- 
lute will, irreproachable integrity, and a remarkably 
comprehensive and remarkably healthy view of public 
affairs. . . . He voluntarily banished the alluring pro- 
spect of a second term, and rose above all jealousy of 
his distinguished associates." 

Whilst his putting aside the chances of a sec- 
ond term may bring a smile to the faces of his 
living distinguished associates, the general ver- 
dict of Dr. Andrews is prophetic of the change 
of public sentiment, and especially of that of 
historical writers, toward the administration 
of President Hayes. On the other hand, he 
thinks that " it may be doubted whether pos-

terity will give Mr. Garfield quite the high 
place assigned him by contemporary judg- 
ment." He was " somewhat vacillating and pas- 
sive, too much dominated by Elaine's stronger 
nature, of solid character, no little personal 
magnetism, and great information." Of Presi- 
dent Cleveland he says that " though a Demo- 
crat, he was yet president of all the people. 
Whatever else might be said against him, none 
could call him a demagogue." The election of 
1888 was " among the most corrupt in our his- 
tory," and President Harrison " cold and re- 
pelling rather than attracting those with whom 
he came into contact." 

The demonetization of silver in 1873 is at- 
tributed to the unauthorized representation of 
the United States as a gold country at the 
Paris conference, and to the fact that the meas- 
ure passed Congress " unobserved ly," without 
any general debate. The allegation of fraud 
and sinister motives being discredited, Dr. 
Francis Walker's arraignment of the legisla- 
tive committee for not placing the question 
properly before the country is quoted : " The 
wisdom of a few people assuming to be wise for 
the whole of a great people was never more 
conspicuously shown than in the demonetiza- 
tion of the silver dollar." 

To the space-exhausting trivialities of local 
disasters and " moving accidents by flood and 
field," the numerous passing contests in the 
labor world, the gruesome story of the harness- 
ing of the redskin to the car of civilization, are 
added many trifling anecdotes, rather forlorn 
specimens of " American humor," which may 
attract the general reader but detract from the 
dignity of true historical writing. As one scans 
the several chapter heads, "The Geneva Awards 
and the Credit Mobilier," " Hayes and the 
Civil Service," " Farthest North," " Anything 
to beat Grant," he cannot refrain from con- 
jecturing what portions of this mass will sur- 
vive in the eventual winnowing to become liv- 
ing parts of history, and what be cast aside as 
chaff. 

That dernier ressort of the reviewer, the 
share of the publishers, must be pardoned in 
this case. The illustrations bear the signa- 
tures of Thulstrup, Clinedinst, Fenn, Pyle, and 
Leigh, and form a most excellent collection of 
pictures made from photographs, diagrams, 
and descriptions by eye-witnesses. Of even 
more value to the student are the maps, plans, 
and facsimiles, which convey him within the 
borderland of the coveted " original sources." 
It is sufficient for general workmanship to say 



that the two volumes are issued by the Messrs. 
Scribner's Sons. As a novelty in the field of 
historical ventures, as the most recent record 
of our national measurements, and as an attract- 
ive exhibition of illustrators' and publishers' 
art, the volumes have no rival in the publica- 
tions of the year. EDWIN E. SPARKS. 



HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 



i. 

The Christmas book-counters will present this 
year the usual tempting array, and none but very 
captious or very bewildered intending purchasers 
will be likely to turn away from them with their 
wants unsatisfied. The output as a whole strikes us 
as in many respects superior to that of previous 
seasons, notably in the essential matter of illustra- 
tions, where a marked advance is shown. Sound 
books, elegant bindings, and artistic pictures are the 
rule ; but there is no lack of the tasteful knick- 
knackery that seems to belong to the season. The 
cumbrous and showy folios popular in former years 
are now plainly extinct. Very sumptuous and costly 
works are not wanting ; but the tendency is in the 
direction of attractively-made books of intrinsic 
worth, at moderate prices. We trust the good taste 
and enterprise shown this year by the publishers 
will meet its due reward which seems likely 
enough now that our quadrennial term of commer- 
cial disturbance is over. As usual, our Holiday 
notices will appear in two instalments, a number of 
them being reserved for publication in our issue of 
December 16. 

In point of sumptuousness the Century Co.'s mag- 
nificent presentation of Professor Sloane's " Life of 
Napoleon Bonaparte " may safely be pronounced 
hors concours among the season's publications. The 
work is a masterpiece of modern luxurious book- 
making. The text is already known to the public 
from its appearance serially in " The Century " 
magazine, and we shall not now pass upon its merits 
further than to say that it is by all odds the most 
exhaustive life of Napoleon yet written, and that it 
has received abundant commendation at the hands 
of competent critics on both sides of the water. The 
feature of the work with which we must now con- 
cern ourselves mainly is the illustrations ; and in 
their effort to render these both eminently suitable 
and rarely attractive, at once a delight to the eye 
and of the due educative value, the publishers have 
certainly done themselves very great credit. No 
resource has been unexhausted, so far as we can 
perceive, to render the book pictorially perfect. It 
is a pleasure to render honor where honor is due 
and we have no hesitation in saying that this noble 
chef d'oeuvre of the book -maker's art surpasses 
thus far any publication of the kind, native or for- 
eign, that has ever fallen under our notice. The

work will be complete in four volumes. Each of 
the twenty-two parts of forty-eight pages into which 
the work is divided contains fourteen full-page plates, 
printed on heavy plate-paper. Four of these are 
reproductions (by a new process, as we learn, which 
is owned by Messrs. Bussod, Valadon & Co. of 
Paris) of noted paintings in the original colors ; 
four are in monotint (one each in blue, green, sepia, 
and red) ; and six are wood-cuts and process-plates 
in black and white. We do not know in what re- 
spect the new process by which the color-work is 
done differs from that of the ordinary chromo- 
lithography ; but its results are certainly superior, 
especially in so far as depth and richness of tint 
and suggestion of over-laid pigment is concerned. 
Among the colored reproductions in the initial vol- 
ume are Meissonier's " 1814," Flameng's " La 
Causerie," Detaille's " Bonaparte in Italy," Isabey's 
" Josephine," " Bonaparte at Arcole " by Gros, 
Georges Cain's " Bulletin of Victory from the Army 
of Italy, 1797," and so on. The completed work 
will contain eighty- eight of these colored plates 
alone, and they should form an interesting and beau- 
tiful collection. 

Messrs. R. H. Russell & Son, of New York, issue 
several large quarto and folio volumes, generally 
similar in make-up, and of an interest mainly pic- 
torial. Two of these volumes " Pictures of Peo- 
ple," by Mr. Charles Dana Gibson, and " In Vanity 
Fair," by Mr. A. B. Wenzell, are of considerable 
artistic merit. " Pictures of People " contains eighty- 
five of Mr. Gibson's latest drawings, including the 
studies of English society recently exhibited at the 
rooms of the Fine Art Society in London. This 
favorite artist's manner needs no characterization 
here, and the present series of drawings presents 
some excellent examples of it. The volume is a 
large folio, twelve by eighteen inches, bound in white 
vellum and stamped with one of those graceful fem- 
inine figures that have rendered Mr. Gibson's pencil 
famous in its kind. Mr. Wenzell's "In Vanity Fair," 
a set of seventy spirited wash-drawings reproduced 
in half-tone, excel, in our judgment, from the artistic 
point of view, the foregoing series. Mr. Wenzell is 
very happy in portraying fashionable society, its 
vagaries and amusements, his scenes at the opera, at 
the Horse Show, " at the Waldorf," and so on, being 
done with much fidelity, and with a humor that 
never lapses into the coarse or grotesque. Unfor- 
tunately, in one plate, entitled " Summer," he has 
essayed a flight into the region of the ideal, and 
the result may well serve to point the useful moral of 
Apelles : " Ne sutor ultra crepidam." The book 
a large folio of twelve by eighteen inches is neatly 
bound in pale-green boards stamped with a figure 
that is certainly not one of the artist's best. Two 
other volumes from the Messrs. Russell are : " Fables 
for the Times," by Mr. H. W. Phillips, with draw- 
ings by Mr. T. S. Sullivant ; and Mr. E. W. Kemble's 
" Coons." Some of Mr. Phillips's " Fables " are new, 
others are adaptations of old favorites in up-to-date 
phraseology. Of the latter class we subjoin an ex- 



ample, which may also serve to indicate the author's 
general style as a fabulist : " A dog with a piece of 
meat in his mouth was crossing a bridge over a 
placid stream. On looking down he saw another 
dog with a precisely similar piece of meat in the 
water below him. ' That 's a singular incident,' he 
thought to himself as he prepared to jump in. 'But 
hold a minute ! The angle of incidence is always 
equal to the angle of reflection. Upon reflection I 
find that the other dog and the meat are only optical 
phenomena.' And he trotted on his way to Boston 
without further thought on the matter." Mr. Sulli- 
vant's drawings are a little in Mr. A. B. Frost's 
vein, and are suitably funny. Mr. E. W. Kemble's 
" Coons " has no bearing on the arboreal animals 
commonly known by that title, but is a series of 
humorous sketches of the Southern darky (locally 
" coon ") drawn from life by Mr. Kemble during a 
recent trip through the South. The plates are half- 
tones, printed in sepia, and the volume is a large 
quarto, nine and one-half by twelve inches. The 
artist shows keen appreciation of the oddities of the 
unsophisticated negro of the old-fashioned type, and 
his drawings are both laughable and graphic. 

A well planned and finely executed art work is 
The Century Co.'s " Modern French Masters," com- 
prising a series of twenty biographical and critical 
monographs, each written by an American artist of 
repute chosen because of his special knowledge of 
or sympathy with the painter assigned him for treat- 
ment. The papers are not only criticisms of their 
respective subjects from the artists' point of view, 
but are in many cases the friendly personal recol- 
lections of a former pupil or intimate friend. Mr. 
Will H. Low writes on Ge*r6me and Boutet de Mon- 
vel ; Mr. Kenyon Cox on Puvis de Chavannes and 
Baudry ; Mr. J. Carroll Beckwith on Carolus Duran 
and Manet ; Mr. E. H. Blashfield on Bonnat and 
Jean- Paul Laurens ; Theodore Robinson on Corot 
and Monet ; W. A. Coffin on Rousseau and Dagnan- 
Bouveret ; G. P. A. Healy on Couture ; H. W. Wat- 
rous on Meissonier ; Arthur Hoeber on Diaz ; 
William H. Howe on Troyon ; D. W. Tryon on 
Daubigny ; Wyatt Eaton on Millet, and Samuel 
Isham on Courbet. We regret the omission from 
the list of Michel ; and if we remember rightly, 
there was a good article on that strong and original 
painter in the " Century Magazine " some three 
years ago though perhaps the writer of it was not 
an artist. Of course the striking feature of the vol- 
ume is the illustrations ; and these, consisting of 
thirty-seven wood engravings and twenty-eight half- 
tone photographic plates, afford an excellent oppor- 
tunity of judging of the relative merits of the two 
methods of reproduction. For our own part we 
should say that, regarded merely as translations of 
the original works, the half-tone plates are generally 
superior ; but they lack the strength, depth, and 
richness of effect of the best engravings. Among 
the engravers represented we note Mr. Timothy 
Cole, who furnishes six plates ; Mr. Elbridge Kings- 
ley, who furnishes thirteen ; and Mr. Henry Wolf, 



334 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



who furnishes six. Mr. Kingsley's series of plates 
after Diaz and Daubigny are notably good. Some 
of the works reproduced are : Corot's " Orpheus 
Greeting the Morn," Game's "Thirst " and " The 
Carpet Merchant " (both finely rendered by Mr. 
Wolf), Rousseau's "St. Michael's Mount" and 
" Twilight," Diaz's landscapes " Under Sunshine " 
and " Under Twilight," Millet's " The Sower " and 
" The Sheep-Shearer," Courbet's " The Musician," 
Manet's " Le Bon Bock," Bastion-Lepage's " Joan 
of Arc" (detail), Dagnan-Bouveret's " Horses at 
the Watering-Trough," etc. A brief preface is fur- 
nished by Professor John C. Van Dyke, the editor 
of the volume, who also appends to each essay a 
biographical note on its author. Professor Van 
Dyke has a few judicious remarks to make on the 
painter's time-honored contention that no one but a 
painter is a competent judge of a picture, as well as 
on its common reductio ad absurdum that then no 
one but a cook knows a good dinner, and no one but 
a cobbler can appreciate a good pair of shoes. Pro- 
fessor Van Dyke sensibly concludes that while the 
painter is undoubtedly the better judge (we should 
say in most cases the only judge) of technic, there 
is no reason why the cultured outsider should not be 
equally competent to determine the final result of a 
work of art, and its success or failure as a whole. 
Perhaps one may add that the tendency of the 
painter as critic to base his estimate of a work of art 
on its technical quality alone, and to unduly ignore 
its intellectual and aesthetic side, may very conceiv- 
ably sometimes render that estimate of more than 
questionable value. A canvas may well be tech- 
nically exquisite, and at the same time morally and 
aesthetically shocking. We do not think that the 
painter's verdict on works of this description is apt 
to be as sound as that of the outside public. But 
we cheerfully agree with Professor Van Dyke that 
" Soundness of technic is a condition to all great 
art." The present work forms a noble companion 
volume to its publishers' " Old Italian Masters " and 
" Old Dutch and Flemish Masters " of former sea- 
sons. It is distinctly a credit to American book- 
making, from every point of view ; and the popu- 
larity of French art in this country should insure it 
a cordial reception. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. issue a noble 
illustrated edition, in two large octavo volumes, of 
Mr. John Fiske's " The American Revolution " that 
appears in the nick of time for those seeking a gift- 
book at once seasonably ornate and intrinsically 
valuable and weighty. The plates are well chosen 
and well made, serving the double purpose of em- 
bellishment and instruction. They consist of twenty- 
two photogravures of portraits and paintings, to- 
gether with some 280 text cuts representing historic 
buildings, medals, facsimiles, etc. There are also 
some excellent colored maps and plates. Mr. Fiske's 
graphic and spirited narrative gains much by the 
addition of these pictures, in the selection of which 
we understand he has cooperated ; and the work 
may be pronounced a satisfactory example of how 



history should be illustrated. In fact, we do not see 
how the plates could be at all materially improved 
upon. The volumes are printed from new electro- 
type plates on first-class paper, and present alto- 
gether a most attractive appearance. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. issue a profusely 
illustrated two-volume edition of Herman Grimm's 
monumental " Life of Michael Angelo." The idea 
was a good one, and it has been well carried out. 
The illustrations comprise a steel portrait of Michael 
Angelo, together with twenty-three photogravure 
plates from his paintings and sculptures, and seven- 
teen from notable works of other Italian masters 
Raphael, Titian, Da Vinci, Botticelli, Perugino, 
Correggio, Fra Angelico, and others. The volumes 
are richly bound in maroon cloth stamped with gold, 
and are sheathed in slip-covers. Grimm's book 
at once a life of the painter and a study of his times 
is classic, and needs no description or commenda- 
tion now. It is as readable as a romance, and teems 
with the fruits of ripe scholarship and profound 
observation. Emerson said of it : " When we come 
to M. Angelo, his Sonnets and Letters must be 
read, with his life by Vasari, or in our day by 
Herman Grimm." Better far, say we, read the life 
by Grimm a surer guide than the lively, imagina- 
tive Italian ; and to read Grimm with the fullest 
measure of enjoyment, read him in the present 
beautiful edition. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are as usual in the 
field with one of their elaborate editions of selected 
works by Irving, this time the " Surrey Edition " of 
" Bracebridge Hall." A deep marginal border in 
green (designed by Miss Margaret Armstrong) 
frames the text on each page, and there are twenty- 
eight very acceptable photogravure illustrations after 
drawings by Messrs. Reinhart, Rackham, Rix, 
Hyde, Church, Sandham, Miller, and Schmolze. 
The binding is very dainty and tasteful, and the 
work should repeat the success of its popular pre- 
decessors. 

" Historic Churches of Paris " (Thomas Whit- 
taker), is a rather handsome volume, profusely and 
instructively illustrated, which indicates throughout 
careful preparation and painstaking research on the 
part of its author, Mr. Walter F. Lonergan. Mr. 
Lonergan claims to have gone a little ahead of all 
other writers, French or English, in his chosen field, 
in that he has dealt at greater length than his pre- 
decessors with the historical events with which the 
older Paris churches are associated. The book is 
thus certainly better suited to the needs and tastes 
of the general reader than archaeological treatises, 
like those of Baron de Guilhermy, which deal chiefly 
with architectural matters, and only touch incident- 
ally on historical events. Mr. Lonergan devotes 
most space to Notre Dame, the Sainte Chapelle, and 
St. Denis ; these churches being the ones chiefly 
interesting to average visitors to Paris, and being, 
moreover, the three great legacies of Gothic genius 
in the possession of the city. " Rouen, Beauvais, 
and Chartres have their own monuments to show 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

the skill of the early French architects and sculptors, 
but in Paris, the cathedral, the chapel of the Law 
Courts, and, to a large extent, the elegant edifice of 
St. Denis, are the only structures reared by the 
genius of the soil, untrammelled by the necessity of 
imitating Greek temples or Roman basilicas at the 
bidding of Royal or imperial patrons." The author 
names as his authorities, the " Chartrelarium EC- 
clesice Parisiensis," Viollet-le-Duc, de Guilhermy, 
Gibbon, Sir F. Palgrave, the Abbs' Perdreau, the 
literary " Paris Guide," and M. Dubre, whose treat- 
ise on the Notre Dame is the nearest approach to 
an historical rather than archaeological work on the 
subject. The illustrations (from photographs and 
after drawings by Mr. B. S. Le Fanu) consist of 
exterior and interior views of the edifices described, 
doorways, windows, archways, gargoyles, and other 
architectural details. The volume is bound in stout 
crimson buckram emblematically stamped in gold, 
with olive-green back and quarter sides. It presents 
an attractive ensemble, and forms a suitable gift for 
a clerical friend, or a friend purposing to explore 
the antiquities of Paris. 

A pretty gift-book of intrinsic worth is M. Andre* 
Theuriet's "Rustic Life in France" (Crowell), illus- 
trated by M. Le*on Lhermitte, and translated by 
Miss Helen B. Dole. The translator's pen has been 
well employed in rendering into fluent and rhyth- 
mic English this charming yet saddening retrospect. 
M. Theuriet's book is at once the description and 
the threnody of French farm-life the rustic epic 
of a passing race of toilers of the field, in which one 
seems to catch an echo of the old lament, " Great 
Pan is dead." " It is all over with rustic life," 
sighs M. Theuriet. Industrial enterprise of the 
modern sort is turning its attention to the fields 
and meadows ; and small farming must ere long 
meet the fate of the unfittest. " Syndicates " will be 
formed to cultivate vast tracts by rapid and econom- 
ical processes. They will clear the forest area 
even now shrinking from year to year like Balzac's 
peau de chagrin. Only the other day a hard-headed 
deputy called the magnificent forests of France 
giant oaks beneath which Frankish warriors fought 
and feasted and throned their heroes on the uplifted 
shield "unproductive wealth." The old rustic 
implements, time out of mind the symbols of the 
poet and the painter's proper accessories the flail, 
the mattock, the sickle, the old-time arau, are 
giving way before the steam plough and reaper, and 
the threshing machine. Utility will rule. " The 
country, furrowed by rectilinear roads, tram-ways, 
gravelled ways, will have the appearance of a great 
chess-board under mechanical cultivation, where 
everything will be by rule, mechanical and special- 
ized, like a gigantic manufactory." Even Stuart 
Mill shrank from such a prospect. As his environ- 
ment changes, the peasant changes. Jacques Bon- 
homme is more and more inclined to leave his vil- 
lage and the paternal acres once his sole care and 
pride. The railroads have brought the ideas, the 
appetites, the pleasures, the unrest of the cities to 



his door ; and if he himself remains rooted to the 
soil, he swears his children shall not. Hence his 
sons and daughters flock (as with us) to the cities. 
" The villages are becoming depopulated ; in cer- 
tain agricultural sections there are no farmers to be 
found, and whole territories remain neglected." 
These changes painfully affect M. Theuriet a 
man of sensibility and a lover of the picturesque ; 
and he mournfully celebrates the obsequies of a 
past which he loves. To preserve in a detailed 
picture the characteristic features of this past, the 
daily routine of French farm-life on a small hold- 
ing the sheep-shearing, vine-dressing, the humble 
field operations, the setting and weaving of flax, 
the gathering of the vintage, the village festivals 
and ceremonies, has been M. Theuriet's primary 
aim. In this labor of love he associated with him- 
self the subtle painter of rustic landscape and genre, 
M. Ldon Lhermitte, whose illustrations, much in 
the manner of Millet, greatly enhance the charm 
and descriptive value of the text. The volume is 
richly bound in crimson cloth, with an emblematic 
side-stamp. Its attractive material ensemble and 
its moderate price should make it a popular gift- 
book. 

A copy of Messrs. J. M. Dent and Co.'s new and 
pretty one-volume edition of " The Compleat An- 
gler " forms a choice gift for a friend of piscatorial 
tastes. The ubiquitous Mr. Andrew Lang is the 
editor, and he has provided a good text, reprinted 
in the main from that of Sir Harris Nicolas, who 
used that of Walton's fifth edition, the last one re- 
vised by him. Cotton's treatise is omitted (this 
fact should have been mentioned editorially), and 
the notes are few and brief. The somewhat lengthy 
Introduction summarizes the events of Izaak's life, 
discusses his character as displayed in his books, 
and comments instructively on the ancient and mod- 
ern practice of fishing a theme on which Mr. Lang, 
himself a reputed " brother of the angle," is very 
much at home. We note that in the Introduction 
Walton's worthy predecessor Dame Juliena Berners, 
author of " The Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an 
Angle," is made to figure as Dame Juliana Barnes. 
The book is profusely and attractively illustrated 
with woodcuts by Mr. E. J. Sullivan, and it forms 
altogether about the best moderate-priced handy 
edition of this sweet and indispensable old classic 
that we know of. The Macmillan Co. are the 
American publishers. 

Mrs. Burton Harrison's " The Externals of Mod- 
ern New York " (A. S. Barnes & Co.) forms a 
desirable supplement to Mrs. Martha J. Lamb's 
" The History of the City of New York," being 
ostensibly Chapter XXL, Volume II. of that useful 
chronicle. Mrs. Lamb's narrative, it may be remem- 
bered, came to a halt with the year 1880 ; and 
Mrs. Harrison takes up the story at that point, and 
brings it down to date as comprehensively as possi- 
ble in the relatively limited space at her command. 
A great many interesting events in New York's 
civic progress (mainly on its material side) have 



336 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



occurred since 1880 ; and of these events Mrs. Har- 
rison gives a succinct and lively description. To 
read her book is to gain a pretty clear notion of 
the salient externals of the Gotham of to-day. With 
the deeper moral, religious, social, and political 
issues that suggest themselves to the philosophical 
observer of New York's civilization, Mrs. Harrison 
does not pretend to deal her business being, like 
her predecessor's, to describe and to narrate. Like 
Mrs. Lamb, she lets facts speak mainly for them- 
selves, wisely crediting her readers with the ability 
to draw a plain inference. The volume is a neatly 
made small quarto of some eighty-five pages (includ- 
ing the index), and is quite presentable enough as 
to externals to form a suitable Holiday gift-book. 
It is liberally illustrated with characteristic views 
and street scenes of the New York of to-day. Those, 
especially, who possess Mrs. Lamb's book should 
obtain Mrs. Harrison's continuation of it though 
the latter may be read as an independent work. 

A brace of smart little volumes, the initial ones 
in the promising series of " Bodley Head Antholo- 
gies," come to us from Messrs. A. C. McCiurg & 
Co., who publish them in conjunction with Mr. John 
Lane of London. The first volume is "English 
Epithalamies," edited by Mr. Robert H. Case ; the 
second is "Musa Piscatrix," by Mr. John Buchan. 
The aim of Mr. Case has been to bring together for 
the first time the Epithalamia or nuptial songs of 
the Elizabethans and their successors, his collection 
including nearly all English poems rightly styled 
Epithalamia by their authors, or which may in the 
now widened acceptation of the term be fairly 
classed as such whether brief songs or longer 
poems, whether original or translated to the close 
of the seventeenth century, with a few admissions 
from the early years of the eighteenth. Narrative 
poems, such as Suckling's " Ballad of a Wedding " 
and Braithwait's " Shepherd's Holyday " are prop- 
erly excluded, as are the numerous class of merely 
congratulatory " Odes " and " Poems " loosely 
styled Epithalamia, though not particularly referring 
to the wedding day. Mr. Case notes as partly indi- 
cating his principle of selection, that "the term 
Epithalmium, originally used to denote the song at 
the bridal chamber as distinguished from those sung 
during the wedding procession or at the feast, has 
long been attached to every kind of nuptial poem, 
provided it be supposed to precede or even imme- 
diately succeed the nuptial night, and concludes with 
a few good wishes more or less allusive to the occa- 
sion." The volume is carefully and elaborately 
edited, containing, besides the poems, a lengthy 
introduction, " A List of Omitted Epithalamia writ- 
ten before 1700," a list of those published since that 
date, and an Appendix containing an account of 
" The maner of rejoysings at mariages and wed- 
dings," from " The Arte of English Poesie." Great 
care has evidently been taken to secure the best 
possible texts ; and the editor has given, where pos- 
sible, in the margin the date of the marriage cele- 
brated, or, failing that, of the poem's appearance 



in print. The collection is an excellent one, and 
contains some of the gems of English lyric verse. 
Mr. Buchan's " Musa Piscatrix " is appropriately 
dedicated to Mr. Andrew Lang, a Walton editor, 
the author of some capital fishing lyrics, and a prac- 
tised angler withal who 

glories to have thrown in air, 

High over arm the trembling reed, 
By Ale and Kail, by Till and Tweed." 

The little book can scarcely claim for itself, as the 
editor admits, the title of an anthology, being no 
serious collection of English fishing songs, whose 
name is legion, but rather a little sheaf of piscatorial 
verses, mostly old and all choicely good, gleaned 
from a relatively narrow field. Little has been 
taken from any one author, save Thomas Tod Stod- 
dart, the angling poet-laureate who is represented 
by a dozen selections ; and the editor has sought to 
include only verse which has some of the higher 
poetic qualities. Among the authors included may 
be noted Shakespeare, Phineas Fletcher, Waller, 
Walton, Marlowe, Raleigh, Donne, Cotton, Pope, 
Gay, Thomson, Scott, Wordsworth, Matthew Ar- 
nold (a rather theoretical angler, one fancies), Mr. 
Andrew Lang, and Mr. Austin Dobson. The editor 
supplies a pleasant foreword and a few brief notes, 
and there are six full-page etchings by Mr. E. 
Philip Pimlott. The volumes are neatly bound in 
blue buckram with chaste cover-design in gold, and 
altogether form unexceptionable gift-books of the 
more modest order. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons' tasteful " Stamboul 
Edition " (authorized) of De Amicis's " Constanti- 
nople " comes with a certain timeliness, now that 
the eyes of the civilized world are turned anxiously 
toward the Golden Horn. The glowing pictures of 
the impressionable Italian traveller fill one with a 
sense of shame and regret that this fair and storied 
city should at the close of our boasted century of 
enlightenment be polluted by scenes of slaughter 
unparallelled since the days of Tamerlane. De 
Amicis was deeply impressed by the oriental splen- 
dor of Constantinople and its matchless environs ; 
and his pen, ever prodigal of lustre and color, is 
tempted into even unwonted rhapsodies. " Oh for 
the eyes of a De Amicis ! " the traveller to the 
Bosphorus may well exclaim " that I, too, might 
see all this splendor where so many phlegmatic souls 
have seen little save squalor, filth, beggary, swind- 
ling landlords, lying dragomans, and dog-infested 
lanes and alleys." Truly, as Goethe said of Rome, 
he who goes to Constantinople takes his Constanti- 
nople with him. The book is one of the author's 
best, and it is well translated by Caroline Tilton. 
There are twenty-five attractive plates, and the 
cover is a chaste one of dark-green with gilt tracery. 

We infer from Mr. Clifton Johnson's pleasant 
foreword to the comely volume of selections from 
Mr. John Burroughs, entitled "A Year in the 
Fields" (Houghton), that the credit of planning 
the book belongs to him. At all events, the idea 
i is a happy one. Mr. Johnson observes that in 



1896.]

337 



all Mr. Burroughs writes the personal element is 
very marked ; and he adds, what is equally unde- 
niable, that not only is Mr. Burroughs present in 
what he writes, but we are glad to have him there. 
The essential idea of the volume which is finely 
illustrated after out-of-door photographs by Mr. 
Johnson is that in it Mr. Burroughs shall be pic- 
torially, as well as spiritually, omnipresent. In the 
frontispiece, for instance, we are shown him stand- 
ing knee-deep in a thick clump of undergrowth, con- 
templating with botanical relish a flowering stalk 
blissfully unconscious the while that Mr. Johnson is 
taking a " snap-shot " at him ; a second plate shows 
him gazing out over the broad expanse of the frozen 
Hudson, perhaps meditating a paragraph, or men- 
tally reckoning the profits of the past season's fruit- 
crop ; in a third he stands nonchalantly, spectacles 
in hand, at the door of his bark-covered study at 
" Riverby "; in a fourth, he is gathering wild flow- 
ers ; in a fifth, splitting wood " for the study fire," 
and so on. The views were secured by Mr. Johnson 
during several visits at Mr. Burroughs's country 
homes on the Hudson and in the Catskills. Whether 
or not the host at these times was entertaining a 
photographer unawares is not apparent; but the 
plates, certainly, are agreeably free from the usual 
suggestion of " posing." The essays, like the pic- 
tures, range through all the four seasons ; and they 
are delightful specimens of Mr. Burroughs at his 
best. The volume is neatly bound in dark-green and 
gilt, and forms a rare gift-book of the more inex- 
pensive sort. 

Mr. J. M. Barrie's capital novel, " A Window in 
Thrums," is brought out by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & 
Co. in an inviting edition the main feature of which 
is seventy photographic views taken in and around 
Kirriemuir (" Thrums ") by that expert knight of the 
camera, Mr. Clifton Johnson. Mr. Johnson met 
Mr. Barrie in Kirriemuir, and the latter expressed 
his approval of this mode of illustrating his master- 
piece. In selecting his views the artist has made an 
effort to follow the suggestions in the text. Thus, 
the list of illustrations embraces such titles as " The 
Door to Hendry's Cot," "The Little Window," 
"The Bill-Sticker," "The Dulseman," "The Loom," 
" The Auld Licht Kirk," " The Manse," " At the 
Gate of the Commonty," and so on. Judging from 
the plates, the country about " Thrums " must be 
rather bleak and harsh ; and the village " types " 
that got in range of Mr. Johnson's camera are cer- 
tainly a hard-featured lot in fact, Scotch people 
of the lower class are apt to be as homely as gar- 
goyles. The famous window, we learn, " looks 
easterly down the brae and over the town, and it is 
remarkable how, as one wanders about the village 
and over the surrounding hill-slopes, the cot at the 
top of the brae comes into view, and how the little 
window preternaturally follows your movements like 
an ever-watchful eye." Under the window there now 
hangs, alas, a sign-board bearing the prosaic legend, 
" A Window in Thrums : Souvenirs and lemonade 
for sale within " for tourists now flock to Kirrie- 



muir, and the tenants of Hendry's cot are thrifty 
folk. It will be a pleasure to read, or to re-read, 
Mr. Barrie's book in this edition. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. are, as usual at this 
season, in the field with well-made and low-priced 
editions of standard books suitable for Christmas 
gifts of enduring value. Among these we may note 
" The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope," in two 
trim duodecimo volumes, edited with notes and 
memoir by Dr. Adolphus William Ward. A good 
text respectably printed is provided, together with 
some interesting facsimiles and reprints of early 
frontispieces. There are also portraits of Pope, 
Spenser, Addison, Queen Anne, Gibber, Swift, 
Donne, and Moliere, and views of Pope's Twicken- 
ham villa and of Windsor Castle from the river. 
Another desirable issue is a two-volume edition of 
the " Poems of Robert Browning," comprising his 
own selection with additions from his latest works. 
The work is edited with biographical and critical 
introduction and notes by Charlotte Porter and 
Helen A. Clarke, editors of " Poet Lore." Type, 
binding, illustrations, etc., are excellent, price consid- 
ered, and the edition strikes us as especially adapted 
to the needs of clubs and schools where the study 
of Browning is pursued. The same firm issues in 
attractive shape John Ormsby's fine version of " Don 
Quixote," also in two volumes. The edition is em- 
bellished with thirty-three spirited etchings by 
Lalauze, together with a portrait and a map. Ample 
editorial helps to intelligent reading are provided, 
and altogether the edition is a good one for actual 
reading. We have often taken occasion to commend 
generally these useful reprints of Messrs. Crowell 
& Co. The putting of good books well made within 
reach of all is a form of private enterprise that is in 
the nature of a public service. 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. have shown fine taste in 
the makeup of a pair of very dainty and enticing 
two-volume editions of two works that should make 
a strong bid for popular favor. The first of them is 
Ouida's lively military novel, " Under Two Flags "; 
and in no other edition of the book that we know 
of can the chequered career of that delectable life- 
guardsman, the Hon. Bertie Cecil, be followed un- 
der such alluring material conditions. The binding 
is of blue cloth with gold side-stamp, and the page 
is a pretty one with sufficient margin and clear 
print. Each volume contains four illustrations, after 
the spirited drawing of M. G. Montbard. The 
second work is " Myths and Legends of Our Own 
Land," by Mr. Charles M. Skinner. Anyone har- 
boring the delusion that America has not yet devel- 
oped a legendary era may be disabused of it by the 
perusal of this varied and interesting collection of 
native myths and legends. The contents are geo- 
graphically classified, the first division including 
legends of " The Hudson and its Hills "; the second, 
those of " The Isle of Manhattoes and Nearby "; 
the third, "On and Near the Delaware"; the 
fourth, "Tales of Puritan Land "; the fifth, "Lights 
and Shadows of the South "; the sixth, " The Cen-

tral States and Great Lakes," and so on, to the 
Pacific Coast. The tales, Mr. Skinner says, " have 
been gathered from sources the most diverse ; rec- 
ords, histories, newspapers, magazines, oral narra- 
tives, and in every case reconstructed." The col- 
lection is certainly most curious and suggestive, and 
seems to justify the author's claim that it is meas- 
urably complete. The volumes are bound in light- 
yellow cloth with a delicate border-design in green, 
and contain a number of pleasing photographic 
plates. 

As usual at the Christmas season, a brace of tiny 
booklets in The Century Co.'s familiar " Thumb- 
nail " series make their appearance and very op- 
portunely for those in search of a specially dainty 
and unpretentious, yet tasteful, Holiday gift-book. 
The volumes this year are : " Break o' Day," by 
Mr. George Wharton Edwards, an old contributor to 
this series ; and " Tracings ; or, A Reflection of 
Nature," by Miss E. Scott O'Connor. Mr. Edwards 
again exploits his particular literary field, the islands 
off the Maine coast, and gives us a collection of 
seven crisp little sketches, which mirror the every- 
day life of the fisher-folk of that outlying region 
their quarrels, friendships, courtships, and so on. 
Some pretty drawings accompany the text. Miss 
O'Connor's " Tracings " is a collection of aphorisms, 
in the manner of La Rochefoucauld, prefaced by 
a sprightly little essay on aphorisms and aphorists 
in general, by Miss Agnes Repplier. Miss O'Connor 
has the right knack of packing much sense in few 
words, and deserves the pleasant things Miss Rep- 
plier says of her. The volumes are of vest-pocket 
size, full gilt, and bound in full stamped leather. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. issue a very dainty 
illustrated edition of MerimeVs masterpiece, " Car- 
men," with an appreciative Memoir of the author by 
Miss Louise Imogen Guiney. Mr. Edmund H. Gar- 
rett is the artist, and his five etched plates and 
seven etched vignettes are nicely done. The frontis- 
piece is a portrait in photogravure of Calve" as Car- 
men a pretty thing in itself, though we should 
have preferred, on grounds of general fitness, the 
artist's ideal of his author's tempestuous heroine. 
The cover is of pale-green cloth, with a modest de- 
sign in dark-green and gold. 

The Century Co. issue a new and cheaper edition 
of Mr. Theodore Roosevelt's familiar " Ranch Life 
and the Hunting Trail," with the original drawings 
by Mr. Frederic Remington. The book is easily 
chief in its especial field, and the reprint is in 
remarkably good style, its very moderate price con- 
sidered. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Remington form 
a very strong team in depicting the Far West and 
its types ; and we are glad to see this fresh and 
spirited work put in popular and inexpensive form. 

Two new books in Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s 
dainty " Faience Edition " are George Sand's " Fa- 
dette " and Pierre Loti's "An Iceland Fisherman." 
The translator of the former book is Mrs. James 
M. Lancaster ; of the latter, Miss Helen B. Dole ; 
and both ladies have acquitted themselves credit- 



ably. The volumes are acceptably illustrated, and 
they rank among the best of the more inexpensive 
gift-books. 

" In a North Country Village " (Little, Brown, & 
Co.), by M. E. Francis (Mrs. Francis Blundell), is 
a deftly-woven and summer-scented garland of tales 
and sketches of English rustic life, that reminds one 
pleasantly of Miss Mitford. Thornleigh, a slum- 
brous little place of the now vanishing type of that 
immortal hamlet that nestles as it were amid the 
sounding stanzas and solemn reveries of the 
" Elegy," is the village in question ; and to its cus- 
toms, humors, types, and traditions the author de- 
votes some 260 graphic pages. The book is sym- 
pathetically illustrated by Mr. F. Felloes, and con- 
tains a colored frontispiece. 

A suitable gift-book for a lover of Browning would 
be found in a copy of Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.'s 
rather showy edition of " Saul." The volume is a 
handy octavo, tastefully bound in green and gold ; 
and the text is clearly printed on rather thick glazed 
paper with liberal margin. Mr. Frank O. Small's 
drawings are acceptably done, for the most part, 
reflecting successfully the fine Hebraic spirit of the 
verse. The price of the volume is moderate, in view 
of its elaborate make-up. 



BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

It is interesting to note that neither the hard times 
nor the late political absorption has prevented the pub- 
lication of fully the usual quota of children's Christmas 
books. The average of quality, too, is well maintained. 
In fact, quite a complete youth's library might be se- 
lected from the books published this year if it were 
properly chosen. There is no fallacy more absurd than 
the popular one that anybody is qualified to select a 
library for a child. A library should always be an ex- 
pression of the tastes and ideas of an individual, a 
family, or a circle. If it is not such an expression, it is 
not a library it is simply a crude collection of books. 
To use a homely figure, a youth's library should fit him, 
but it should fit him loosely; space should be left for 
him to grow. It should represent, of course, his tastes 
and mental bent should show whether he is controlled 
in the main by the spirit of adventure, of science, of 
art, or of music; but there should be room in it for a 
few books a little above his mental stage, so that he 
may be constantly led to reach up to them. Another 
pernicious fallacy regarding children's books is that 
style does not appeal to the young. If anyone believes 
it does not, let him open, among the current season's 
books, the one prepared by Mr. Andrew Lang with the 
title " The Animal Story Book " (Longmans), and read 
to any intelligent child of nine years Dumas pere's de- 
scription of Mysouf I., Mysouf II., and Pritchard, and 
note how soon Dumas pere becomes a living personality 
to the child. Then let him turn and read, out of the 
same book, the account of " Cowper and bis Hares." 
Bess and Puss and Tiney were doubtless as interesting 
in their way as the dogs and cats and monkeys owned 
by Dumas pere ; but the child does not care for them 
he begs you to read more from Dumas. Young as 
the child is, Dumas has cast a spell around him the 



1896.]

spell of a sparkling and animated style. Mr. Lang's 
" Animal Story Book " ought to delight both old and 
young, as one may find therein pen-portraits of most of 
the remarkable animals that have interested the world 
since primitive times. And because authors are, as a 
class, peculiarly fond of animals, the reader of this 
charming book is brought into intimate relations with 
Pliny, The'ophile Gautier, and many other remarkable 
men. 

Mr. Rudyard Kipling's " Soldier Stories " (Mac- 
milllan) are evidently intended for boys of a somewhat 
larger growth. Some parents might think them pretty 
strong meat for even their older boys; but there are 
great elemental truths underlying the stories, which 
will not be lost upon readers of any age. In this book 
Mr. Kipling has given some of his largest and most 
vivid views of the life of the British soldier. In some 
respects he appears to challenge comparison with Les 
Trois Mousquelaires ; the British riflemen, Ortheris, 
Mulvaney, and Learoyd, seeming as fond of war and as 
contemptuous of the raw soldier as were their prede- 
cessors, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. The story en- 
titled " With the Main Guard " is almost Homeric in 
tone and treatment. " The Drums of the Fore and Aft " 
is a unique study of the life and death of two plucky 
drummer-boys, who are genuine types. " The Courting 
of Dinah Shadd" is a soldier's idyl; while "The Man 
Who Was " is a most telling protest against the Rus- 
sian Siberian prison system. The illustrations of this 
book are genuine additions to the text. 

All of the charm and much of the tragedy of South- 
ern life before the Civil War may be found in Mr. Joel 
Chandler Harris's two juvenile books, " Daddy Jake 
the Runaway " (Century Co.) and " The Story of Aaron 
the Son of Ben AH " (Houghton). Daddy Jake the 
Runaway " is not so picturesque as " The Story of 
Aaron," but it is more artistic. No better short story of 
plantation life has yet been written. " The Story of 
Aaron the Son of Ben Ali," the Arab chief who was sold 
as a negro slave, and of the fierce horse Timoleon, is not 
only picturesque but is strikingly oriental in its tone. 
An air of mystery surrounds both the characters, and 
even the adult reader is almost persuaded that Aaron 
understands the language of animals. There is a slight 
historic background to this unique story, and one meets 
again with the faces of Buster John, Sweetest Susan, 
and Drusilla, familiar to readers of Mr. Harris's pre- 
vious books. 

Another book distinguished for its admirable style is 
Mr. S. R. Crockett's " Sweetheart Travellers " (Stokes). 
It may perhaps interest fathers and mothers even more 
than children, as it is full of that loving comprehension 
of a little maid's sayings and fancies which comes to a 
father just once in a life-time during that period when 
he is curiously studying the nameless little arts of his 
first-born. It is daintily illustrated by Mr. Gordon 
Browne and Mr. W. H. C. Groome. 

That veteran delineator of boy character and life, 
Mr. J. T. Trowbridge, has written one of the best boy's 
books of the season in " The Prize Cup " (Century Co.). 
It is healthful and inspiring, and tells with force and 
interest the old story of the ease with which a well- 
meaning but weak-willed boy may be led into tempta- 
tion from mere good nature. The contrasting charac- 
ters of Osk Ordway, Gideon Ketterell, Fred Melverton, 
and Canton Quimby are admirably defined. There are 
several humorous characters as Mrs. Ketterell the 
sturdy washerwoman, and Gran'sir Pudgwick. Midget 



is a charming little deaf-and-dumb child, whose whim- 
sicalities and quaint ideas of right and wrong enliven 
the book. The story is sympathetically illustrated by 
Mr. Relyea. 

Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks's " Century Book of Famous 
Americans," published by the Century Co. under the 
auspices of the " Daughters of the Revolution," will 
rank in trustworthiness and in local color, if not in dra- 
matic presentation, with Colonel Higginson's and Mr. 
John Fiske's histories for the young. The chapter on 
the Adams family is particularly interesting and sug- 
gestive. The book could be used to advantage in schools 
for supplementary reading. The illustrations are well 
executed, and add greatly to the interest of the work. 

A book in a quite different field, written by Mr. 
Elbridge S. Brooks in collaboration with Mr. John 
Alden, is " The Long Walls " (Putnam). It is an ex- 
periment in archaeology, being an account of a boy's 
experience in excavating ancient marbles in Greece. 
The hero discovers a subterranean chamber sacred to 
Demeter, wherein the mystic rites connected with the 
worship of that goddess were celebrated in primitive 
times. The story is graphically told, with a judicious 
admixture of classic lore. If it fails to inspire Ameri- 
can boys with a passion for antiquities, it will at least 
acquaint them with many interesting matters connected 
with ancient history and literature. The book is well 
illustrated from photographs taken in Greece. 

Another boy's book by Mr. Elbridge S. Brooks is " Un- 
der the Tamaracks " (Penn Publishing Co.). It is a lively 
story of life in the Thousand Isles, in the St. Lawrence 
river. The three boys who inhabit Tamarack Tower 
meet General Grant, who is summering at the Thousand 
Isles, and the readers of the book share the advan- 
tages of the distinguished acquaintanceship. The main 
interest of the story, however, centres in the doings of 
two undesirable neighbors, one of whom, "the Seedy 
Man of Whiskey Island," seems to be a new type of the 
disagreeable characters that sometimes infest the mod- 
ern summer home. The story and its illustrations are 
of a kind to delight the heart of the average boy for 
whom it was evidently written. 

Oddly enough, Mr. James Otis's "Admiral J. of 
Spurwink " (A. I. Bradley & Co., Boston) has a plot not 
unlike that of Mr. Brooks's " Under the Tamaracks," 
substantially the same idea evidently occurring to both 
authors, and Mr. Otis's " Admiral " apparently belong- 
ing to the same unlovely type as " the Seedy Man of 
Whiskey Island." The book is full of thrilling adven- 
ture and hair-breadth escapes, for " Admiral J." was an 
unscrupulous villain with a long head for mischief. 

Another book by Mr. James Otis is " A Short Cruise " 
(Crowell), a pretty little story of a sea-captain's sudden 
fancy for a quiet little girl. The three characters of 
the crusty old sea-captain, the mischievous boy, and the 

demure little maiden are well contrasted A third 

little book by Mr. Otis is called " On Schedule Time " 
(Whittaker). It is a stirring account of the manner in 
which two plucky boys made a rapid journey through 
the woods in order to reach a lumbering camp within a 
given time, so as to save their father from what might 
have been a disastrous lawsuit. 

Any young person who is interested in commercial 
affairs will find Mr. J. Macdonald Oxley's " Romance 
of Commerce " (Crowell) both useful and entertaining. 
The author has described such famous commercial en- 
terprises as " The Mississippi Bubble," " The South Sea 
Bubble," and " The Hudson's Bay Trading Co.," in a 



340 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



manner to afford any intelligent boy an insight into the 
nature of commercial affairs. The value of the book is 
enhanced by quaint old pictures and portraits from con- 
temporary prints. 

Books of fairy-tales appear this season in good num- 
bers and of good quality. Miss Zoe Dana Underbill's 
volume entitled " The Dwarfs' Tailor and Other Fairy 
Tales " (Harper) has a scope much broader than its title 
indicates, since it aims to give a typical tale from the 
folk-lore of various countries. The result is a collection 
of fairy stories which, with their attractive illustrations, 
will delight the heart of any imaginative child Other 
fortunate children will be enabled to make many pleas- 
ant voyages on the sea of imagination by means of Mr. 
Joseph Jacobs's " Book of Wonder Voyages " (Mac- 
millan). Many famous voyages are included, such as 
" The Argonauts," " The Voyage of Maelduin," " Hasan 
of Bassorah," and " The Journeyings of Thorkild and 
of Eric the Far-Travelled." The illustrations of the 
book, by Mr. John D. Batten, are very weird and fan- 
tastic. A new edition of Hawthorne's " Wonder Book 
for Girls and Boys " (Crowell), with a colored frontis- 
piece and several striking illustrations in black and 
white, is a boon for the child who loves the old Greek 
myths. In reading the stories of " The Miraculous 
Pitcher," " The Chimsera," and " The Gorgon's Head," 
one almost feels as if Hawthorne and the poet Morris 
were the only true story-tellers of our time. It is 
almost a century since the Grimm Brothers put their 
profound folk-lore investigations into the form of those 
fairy tales that have delighted so many generations of 
children; and their popularity seems to increase rather 
than diminish. Miss Lucy Crane's translation of some 
of the best of these stories is published in a pretty and 
inexpensive volume by Messrs. Crowell & Co. The 
illustrations, one of them in colors, by Mr. Walter 
Crane, give an added charm to the little book. In 
" The Wonderful Fairies of the Sun " (Roberts) Mr. 
Ernest Vincent Wright attempts a versified narrative of 
the doings of various tricksy spirits, including " The 
Musical Sprites," "The Frost Fairies," "The Wind 
Fairies," " The Cloud Fairies," etc. The illustrations, 
by Miss Cora M. Norman, are well suited to the fan- 
tastic character of the book. The new and remarkably 
cheap edition of " Tales from Hans Andersen " (Mac- 
millan), with numerous illustrations by Miss Helen 
Stratton, will not make its appeal in vain to the buyer 
of children's gift-books. The collection includes those 
fairy stories which may be numbered among the classics, 
such as " The Ugly Duckling," The Little Mermaid," 
and " The Wild Swans." Some original stories by Miss 
Bessie Hatton are brought within this category by their 
title, " The Village of Youth, and Other Fairy Tales " 
(Stokes), although they deal almost too much with the 
theme of love to be adapted to the taste or needs of 
children. The book is acceptably illustrated from de- 
signs by Mr. W. H. Margetson. 

A decided novelty of the season is Dr. Garrett New- 
kirk's "Rhymes of the States" (Century Co.). The 
work seems to have been planned upon Dr. Arnold's 
favorite theory that a dry fact is best impressed on the 
mind of a child by means of a jingle. The aim has been 
to embody familiar facts in the history and geography 
of the country in a series of easy rhymes, a set for each 
State; and these are accompanied with pictures illus- 
trating the ideas conveyed in the verses. There are 
also good outline maps of each State, with a caricature 
picture of some familiar object or animal to which the 



outline bears a fanciful resemblance. Thus, Indiana is 
represented as an Indian chief, Georgia in the military 
figure of General Oglethorpe, while Mississippi is given 
General Jackson's military coat. The illustrator of the 
book, Mr. Harry Fenn, has been signally successful in 
his representations in black-and-white; and the silhou- 
ettes of the States have been accurately drawn to scale 
by Mr. H. L. Bridwell. 

One of the best of the season's books for girls is Mrs. 
C. V. Jamison's "Seraph, the Little Violinist" (W. A. 
Wilde & Co.). The scene is laid in the French Quarter 
of New Orleans; and there is a generous "Monsieur 
Nardi," who is a bibliomaniac and has a rare old book- 
shop; Seraph's little mother is a cripple, a maker of 
artificial flowers; and "Unc' Romeo" is the typical 
Southern negro servant. With these materials Mrs. 
Jamison has created a charming child's story, with a 
delightful musical atmosphere. The book is daintily 
illustrated by Mr. Frank T. Merrill. 

Perhaps the most prolific writer for boys of the pres- 
ent day is Mr. G. A. Henty, whose stories would alone 
fill a small book-case. Three new books by him are 
presented this year by Messrs. Seribner's Sons " At 
Agincourt," the adventurous story of an English page 
who with his mistress was held as a hostage in Paris by 
the French King Charles; " On the Irrawaddy," depict- 
ing the stirring experiences of an English boy attached 
to the staff of Sir Archibald Campbell during some of 
the famous campaigns in India; and "With Cochrane 
the Dauntless," the narrative of a young British soldier 
who served under Lord Cochrane in Chili and Brazil, 
was a prisoner in Peru, and escaped almost miracu- 
lously from innumerable perils in field and dungeon. 
The three books are freely illustrated. 

A curious collection of verse and prose descriptive of 
a dainty little maiden whom the author styles " W. V." 
is Mr. William Canton's " W. V., Her Book " (Stone 
& Kimball). The heroine is described as an eager little 
creature who wants to take the whole of life at once into 
her two diminutive hands. She has a vocabulary of 
her own; some words she has coined, some she has ap- 
propriated, and others she has turned topsy-turvy. She 
delights in fairy lore, and wants some one to invent for 
her the story of a little girl who lived in a bubble. The 
book is quaintly illustrated by Mr. C. E. Brock. 

The romance of history, properly treated, is about as 
wholesome and appetizing a literary diet as can be pro- 
vided for young folks. One of the best of the season's 
books of this character is Mr. Joel Chandler Harris's 
volume on Georgia, in the series of " Stories from Amer- 
ican History" (Appleton). The popular author of 
" Uncle Remus " has collected from out-of-the-way 
places and hidden nooks of literature a large number of 
stories connected with the history of Georgia, making a 
book which much resembles Mr. John Esten Cooke's 
" Stories of the Old Dominion." The whole field of 
Georgia's life is covered, stories of the hardy pioneers 
of ante-Revolution days finding place with the daring 
" Andrews raid " during the Civil War. The volume is 
well illustrated. 

The boy who has never happened to read Captain 
Mayne Reid's stories of " The Bush Boys," " The Boy 
Hunters," or " The Young Voyageurs," is well provided 
for this year by the handsome illustrated editions issued 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, and appropriately named 
" The Nimrod Edition." These stories might almost be 
termed boy-classics; certainly no boy's education as an 
adventurer could be considered quite complete until he

THE DIAL

has read them. They are a connecting link between 
" Robinson Crusoe " and " The Three Musketeers " 
just as Dumas pere is in the end succeeded by Hugo and 
Gautier. 

A rollicking story for a boy of ten or twelve years of 
age, which might well precede the works of Mayne 
Reid, is Mr. Frank R. Stockton's "Captain Chap" 
(Lippincott). It has some interesting incidents, laugh- 
able situations, and witty sayings, although " Captain 
Chap " and " Adam " are not original types, and the 
literary quality of the work will hardly add to Mr. 
Stockton's reputation. 

Few writers are better fitted to prepare boys' stories 
from Greek and Latin sources than is Mr. Charles 
Morris, whose life has been spent in the preparation of 
such literary and historical compendiums, and whose 
popular " Half Hour Series " may be found in almost 
every public library in the country. This year he pre- 
sents two pretty companion volumes of " Historical 
Tales" (Lippincott), one from Greek and one from 
Latin sources. The volumes are well illustrated with 
classic views and portraits, and will make a safe and 
attractive present for any bright boy or girl. 

Miss Evelyn Raymond's " A Cape May Diamond " 
(Roberts) is rather overdrawn, although there is con- 
siderable cleverness in the management of the plot, and 
in the dialect. It must be a rather difficult feat to 
create a child-philanthropist out of a little shipwrecked 
waif who has never known what it is to have a home or 
guardianship. Perhaps the author has insisted a little 
too much upon pointing the moral, and hence the story 
has suffered. 



I^ITEKARY NOTES. 



" Under the Greenwood Tree " has just been added 
to the handsome library edition of Mr. Hardy's novels, 
published by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Part XVI. of Mr. Thomas J. Wise's beautiful edition

include Professor Marshall's " Economics " and Mr. 
Balfour's " Foundations of Belief." The latter work has 
been extensively criticised in the Japanese press. 

"My Father as I Recall Him," by the late Miss 
Mamie Dickens, daughter of Charles Dickens, is to be 
published this month by the Roxburghe Press, of West- 
minster, England. The work will contain much new 
matter relating to the home life of the novelist, and will 
be illustrated with reproductions of several unpublished 



photographs. The final proofs of the book have been 
revised by the author's sister, Mrs. Perugini. 

" Uncle Tom's Cabin " and its " Key " form two vol- 
umes of the handsome " Riverside " edition of Mrs. 
Stowe's writings now in course of publication by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The Story of Uncle Tom's 
Cabin " is the title of an interesting introductory chap- 
ter contributed by Mr. Charles Dudley Warner. 

Messrs. Scott, Foresman, & Co. issue a neat boxed 
set of three popular volumes by Mr. William Mathews. 
The set includes " Hours with Men and Books," 
"Words: Their Use and Abuse," and "Oratory and 
Orators." This house also publishes a new edition of 
" Getting on in the World," by the same author. 

Miss Mathilde Blind died on the 27th of November. 
A daughter of Herr Karl Blind, the friend of Kossuth 
and Mazzini, her life was closely associated with the 
group of English sympathizers with the revolutionary 
movement on the Continent. She was a woman of much 
intellectual force, and wrote well in several departments 
of literature. She died at the age of forty-nine. 

" Poet- Lore " will be published quarterly hereafter, 
and the " initial quarterly number " just issued is very 
attractive both as to appearance and contents. We 
wish our Boston contemporary all the success it so 
richly deserves. It has always stood for high ideals in 
literature, and has proved itself well-nigh indispensable 
to the serious student of poetry and literary criticism. 

" The Academy " for November 14 appears in a new 
dress, and under new editorial management. It is hand- 
somely printed, and most of the changes made seem for 
the better. We regret, however, that the reviews are 
no longer to be signed, and cannot but feel that a retro- 
grade step has been taken in thus abandoning what has 
been the most distinctive feature of the paper, ever 
since the late Dr. Appleton started it in 1869. 

Carlyle's " Sartor Resartus," with an interesting Intro- 
duction by Professor Dowden, and a striking photo- 
gravure portrait of the author, is presented as the ini- 
tial volume of Messrs. Ward, Lock & Co.'s " Nineteenth 
Century Classics." Mechanically the book is a delight 
to the eye, being produced at the famous Chiswick 
Press, and is sold at the remarkably low price of seventy- 
five cents. Mr. Clement K. Shorter is the general editor 
of the series. 

Mr. Frederick Saunders, of the Astor Library, has 
been retired from active duty by the trustees, and is to 
receive his salary as a pension for life. He has been 
connected with the library since 1859. He was one of 
the earliest and stoutest champions of the struggle for 
international copyright, and is the author or editor of 
nearly a score of volumes, of which " Salad for the Soli- 
tary " is probably the best known. He is now in his 
ninetieth year. 

The announcements made for the coming year by the 
publishers of " The Atlantic Monthly " are of unusual 
interest. We are promised, among other good things, 
a group of articles on the West, by Professor F. J. 
Turner, a similar group upon the South, by Professor 
W. P. Trent, a series on " The Interpretation of Democ- 
racy during the Last Thirty Years," by Mr. E. L. God- 
kin ; a series " surveying the great activities of the 
nineteenth century," an educational series, an American 
literature series, and some papers on modern Greece, 
by Professor B. L. Gildersleeve. " There are others " 
as well, but these should be enough to whet the appe- 
tite of all lovers of good writing and careful thought.

NOTABLE HOLIDAY BOOKS. 



Cooper's Leather Stocking Tales. 

New edition from new plates, with Introduction by Professor 
BRANDER MATTHEWS. 15 photogravure illustrations by 
FRANK T. MERRILL, and vignette title-pages. 5 vols., 12mo, 
cloth, gilt top, per set, $7.50 ; 5 vols., half calf, gilt top, per 
set, $15.00. 

The present edition has been prepared with the greatest attention to 
details. The paper and typography are of the best. Mr. Merrill has 
taken great pride in making the illustrations faithful to tradition and 
worthy of the text. It is indeed the best issue of these immortal works 
which has ever been put on the market. 

Robert Browning's Poems. 

His own selections, with additions from his latest works. 
Reprinted from the revised text of 1889. Edited with Bio- 
graphical and Critical Notes and Introductions by CHAR- 
LOTTE PORTER and HELEN A. CLARKE. Illustrated with 
portraits and photographs. Photogravure frontispieces. 
2 vols , 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $3.00 ; white back, gilt top, 
$3.00 ; half calf, gilt top, $6.00. 

The text has been scrupulously compared with the author's own re- 
vised readings of 1889, and may be relied upon as the best, in fact the 
only edition of the Selections in which the numerous changes made by 
the poet have been embodied. 

Don Quixote. 

By MIGUEL DE CERVANTES. Translated, with Notes and 
Introduction, by JOHN ORMSBY. With portrait and 33 illus- 
trations by LALAUZE. Photogravure frontispieces. 2 vols., 
12mo, cloth, gilt top, $3.00 ; white back, gilt top, $3.00 ; 
half calf, gilt top, $6.00. 
Mr. Ormsby's translation stands as the most satisfactory version so 

far in the market. No better edition can be fround than this. 

Rustic Life in France. 

Translated from the French of ANDRE THEURIET, by HELEN 
B. DOLE. Illustrations by LEON LHERMITTE. 8vo, cloth, 
gilt top, boxed, $2.50. 
One of the most beautiful books which has ever been produced in the 

United States, and will appeal to all lovers of the truly artistic, whether 

in literature or bookmaking. 

i Saul. 

By ROBERT BROWNING. Holiday Edition, with 20 illustra- 
tions by FRANK O. SMALL. 8vo, gilt top, $1.50. 
It is a masterpiece of verse, and the illustrations add greatly to the 

enjoyment of its exquisite beauty. The volume is exquisitely printed 

and richly bound, and makes an admirable gift-book for the lover of 

Browning. 

Famous American Actors of 
To- Day. 

Edited by F. E. McKAT and CHARLES E. L. WINGATE. Illus- 
trated with 40 portraits. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $2.00. 
Relates the story of upwards of forty of the brightest stars that have 
shone in our theatrical galaxy. The authors of the various sketches are 
well-known writers who have had exceptionally close acquaintance with 
those whom they portray. The combination of authors and subjects 
makes a strong theatrical company. 

History of France. 

By VICTOR DDRUT. Translated from the French by Mrs. 
M. CAREY. With a continuation to the year 1896 by 
J. FRANKLIN JAMESON, Professor of History in Brown Uni- 
versity. Illustrated with photographs, portraits, early prints, 
etc. Photogravure frontispieces. 2 vols., 12mo, cloth, gilt 
top, $3.00 ; half calf, gilt top, $6.00.

down to the present time by Professor Jameson of Brown University. 



Shakespeare's Heroes on the Stage 

By C. E. L. WINGATE, author of " Shakespeare's Heroines 
on the Stage." With numerous portraits. 12mo, cloth, gilt 
top, $2.00. 

Like its predecessor, abounds with piquant anecdotes and reproduc- 
tions of rare engravings. 

Life of Sir Walter Scott.

HOPE SCOTT. Illustrated with portraits and photographs. 

Photogravure frontispiece. 2 vols., 12mo, cloth, gilt top, 

$3.00 ; white back, gilt top, $3.00 ; half calf, gilt top, $6.00. 

In many respects this is superior to the unabridged Life. Lockhart 
was enabled to correct some errors that had slipped into the first biog- 
raphy ; and the condensation which he did with a heroic hand brought 
the whole into a more artistic and readable form. The volumes are 
beautifully illustrated. 

Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte. 

By BOUBKIENNE, his Private Secretary. 4 vols. in 2. Illus- 
trated with portraits, colored map, etc. Photogravure 
frontispieces. 2 vols., 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $3.00 ; half calf, 
gilt top, $6.00. 
Hitherto these have been obtainable only in four volumes. None of 

the features which made the more expensive edition notable have been 

omitted. 

Pope's Complete Poetical Works. 

Edited, with Introduction and Notes, by ADOLPHUS WILLIAM 
WARD, M.A., Litt.D. The Globe Edition, revised and 
enlarged. Illustrated with portraits, early prints, and pho- 
tographs. Photogravure frontispieces. 2 vols., 12mo, cloth, 
gilt top, $3.00 ; white back, gilt top, $3.00 ; half calf, gilt 
top, $6.00. 

This edition, with its reprint of the first edition of " The Rape of the 
Lock" and "The Dunciad," and its illustrations, portraits, and fac- 
simile of pages of Pope's manuscript, cannot be excelled. 

An Iceland Fisherman. 

By PIERRE LOTI. Translated by Mrs. HELEN B. DOLE. 
Daintily illustrated and bound. (Faience Edition.) 16mo, 
cloth, gilt top, $1.00. 
It is now universally recognized as a classic of modern literature. 

Fadette. 

By GEORGE SAND. Translated by Mrs. J. M. LANCASTER. 

Daintily illustrated and bound. (Faience Edition.) 16mo, 

cloth, gilt top, $1.00. 

This story is still considered George Sand's masterpiece. Its sim- 
plicity and beauty of style, its purity and depth of feeling, its poetic 
grace of description, its perfection of plot, have kept its popularity 
undiminished for more than half a century. 

Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. 

(Faience Edition.) 16mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.00. 
The present edition contains an excellent sketch of the translator's 
life ; it reproduces the text of the edition of 1850, the original of which 
is now worth its weight in gold, and also the fifth and last edition, pub- 
lished posthumously, but with the author's final corrections. There is 
also appended as a special feature the same scholar's version of Jami's 
" Salaman and Absal." 

The Gospel in Brief. 

Harmonized and Translated by Count TOLSTOI. A summary 
of the larger work. Prepared for popular use by the author. 
(Authorized Edition.) 12rao, $1.25. 

This new book of Count Tolstoi's will attract wide attention. It is 
the scientific presentation of his later teachings ; it is his gospel, his- 
message to a misbelieving and unbelieving world.

KING NOANETT: 

A Story of Old Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay. 

A NEW HISTORICAL NOVEL. SECOND EDITION. WITH A MAP. JUST OUT. 

By F. J. STIMSON (J. S. of Dale). 

" We are not afraid to predict that ' King Noanett ' will take its place in the hearts of the people with 
such books as Lorna Doone ' and The Little Minister.' A most noble book." JAMES MAC ARTHUR, in the 
September Bookman. 

" It is marked in conception and in execution alike by a trait which, without reserve, we may name beauty. 
The quality of charm which pervades the romantic tales of the Old World is just what distinguishes King 
Noanett.' The real spirit of the book, the temper which gives it inevitable romantic charm, comes from no 
documents at all, but straight from nature. The beauty of this book in its conception is like the beauty of our 
woods and our fields, of our flowers and of our streams. It is native. That is why we love it. Subtly rhyth- 
mical cadences which belong to the essence of lyric prose. In substance and in style alike, then, we may 
welcome ' King Noanett ' as a thing of beauty." Prof. BARRETT WENDELL, of Harvard University, in the 
Boston Transcript. 

" A book which it is hard to put down until the end is reached. The climax is a triumph of clever manipu- 
lation. It is a credit to American letters to have produced such a book. We trust that no one will miss the 
opportunity of making the acquaintance of ' King Noanett.' " New York Examiner. 

" We have read few fictions whose interest was so steady, so continuous and so absorbing. ' King Noanett ' 
must, however, be read in full to be justly appreciated. We sincerely commend the story to our readers." 
New York Independent. 

"And who but an Irishman could have said 'Heigho ! 'Tis the women who make the trouble of this life 
and life worth the trouble.' Mr. Stimson has done his best work in ' King Noanett,' and in ' Miles Courtenay ' 
he has added an immortal figure to the characters of fiction." JAMES JEFFREY ROCHE, in The Pilot. 

" ' King Noanett ' is a book designed for all ages." New York Tribune. 

" So far as American fiction is concerned, ' King Noanett ' is far and away the book of the year. Certainly 
nothing fresher or more original has found its way into our literature for many a year. The volume possesses 
a distinct historical value." LITERARY EDITOR, The Boston Transcript. 

" It is interesting. It is spirited. It has movement and life. The young Irish cavalier is a delightful 
acquaintance. ' King Noanett ' possesses positive merits." Literary World. 

"A stirring and delightful romance." Congregationalist. 

" It is difficult to describe the fascination of its style, the enchantment which it wields, and the spiritual 
beauty which illumines the whole work." JAMES MACARTHUR, in The Bookman. 

" Mr. Stimson writes as good a story as Du Maurier." Brooklyn Eagle.

By W. C. BROGGER and NORDAHL ROLFSEN. Translated by WILLIAM ARCHER. With numerous illustrations, 

portraits, and maps. 8vo, $4.00. 

*** Though Fridtiof Nansen is still a young man, his life has from the first been full of activity and adventure. His 
countrymen, Nordahl Rolf sen and Professor W. Brogger, have written and edited a popular account of his family (which is 
noted in Scandinavian history), his training, his domestic life, and his scientific and sporting enterprises. They have applied 
to specialists for chapters on his work as a biologist, on the scientific significance of his famous crossing of Greenland, and on 
the history and conditions of Arctic exploration. A full account is given of the " Fram," and of the preparations for the recent 
expedition.

A NEW WORK ON AFRICA. 

TIMBUCTOO THE MYSTERIOUS. 

By FELIX DUBOIS. Translated from the French. With 158 
illustrations and 8 maps. Demy 8vo, cloth ornamental, $3.50. 
" Timbuctoo has always been mysterious, and is less known to En- 
glish readers than the City of the Sun. To the ordinary reader, the very 
name is but a geographical expression signifying some city in the very 
farthest corner of the world, and of the inhabitants he knows nothing. 
This book, however, will enlighten him, for it traces the history of the 
city from the early ages of Egyptian civilization up to the present day, 
and shows, with the aid of many beautiful illustrations, the rise and fall 
of the capital of Darkest Africa." 

H. RIDER HAGGARD'S NEW STORY. 

THE WIZARD. 

By H. RIDER HAGGARD, Author of "She," " King Solomon's 

Mines," " Joan Haste," etc. With 19 full-page illustrations 

by CHARLES KERR. Crown 8vo, cloth ornamental, $1.25. 

Mr. Rider Haggard's new story has a motive which is believed to be 

new to recent fiction. The tale is African and deals with the conversion 

of a savage tribe by a missionary and martyr, who does not trust to 

the ordinary resources of proselytism, but takes his stand upon a literal 

interpretation of the New Testament promises. The story tells how his 

faith triumphed and how it was strangely supported and justified by a 

superior Power working through the forces of nature and granting a 

direct aid which so many deny in these latter days to be vouchsafed to 

man. The keynote of the book is that Faith can, and still does, work 

miracles.

" At the very first sentence the reader realizes that he is breathing a rarer air than usually emanates from the 
printed page, and at the very last sentence he realizes how he has been kept on the heights. . . . Whatever the

CHARLES DEXTER ALLEN writes as follows in the Hartford Post : " Before one gets to the story itself, he 
must stop and admire the handsome setting the book has received. Bound in dark blue, with a bold cover design 
in gold, it has an especially designed title-page by George Wharton Edwards, and an excellent frontispiece by the 
same artist. Its title, ' The Lure of Fame,' will suggest something of the thread of the story, but one is not 
thereby prepared for so tender and sympathetic a picture as those pages reveal, or so close an analysis of human 
feelings and experiences."

WALT WHITMAN, THE MAN. 

A Very Important Volume of Personal Reminiscences. 

By THOMAS DONALDSON. Illustrated by 13 portraits, facsimiles of rare documents, letters, and manuscripts. Beautifully 

printed on fine deckel-edge paper and bound in red buckram, gilt, gilt top, post Svo, 300 pages $1.75 

A more readable volume of personal reminiscences it would be hard to produce. Mr. Donaldson was Mr. Whitman's friend for 30 years, and 

for the last 20 years of the latter's life was in the closest and most constant intimacy with him. 

This volume will give the admirers of Mr. Whitman an entirely new view of the poet. Walt Whitman, the author, has been done and doubly 

done, while Walt Whitman, the man, appears to have been almost entirely overlooked. 



Was General Thomas Slow at Nashville?

12mo, cloth, uncut, 95 pages. Edition limited to 450 copies, printed 

on hand-made paper $1.25 net. 

One of the most brilliant chapters in our war history in fact in the 

history of cavalry in any war and but little known to the general 

reader. 

Rainy Days in a Library.

curious and humorous quotations from them.) By Sir HERBERT 
MAXWELL. Handsomely printed on fine English deckel-edge book 

paper. 12mo, cloth, uncut $1.50 

The thirteen chapters represent so many rainy days, each of which 
the author spends in the library of an English country house. As be 
looks over old books, he gossips on them, their authors and contempo- 
raries, and gives many curious and humorous quotations from their 
pages. 

The Story of Nell Qwyn. 

With the Sayings of Charles II. By PETER CUNNINGHAM. With the 
author's latest corrections. Edited, with Notes, Life, and Introduc- 
tion, by Henry B. Wheatley, F.S.A., with all the Illustrations to which 
are added Four rare Portraits of Nell Gwyn, printed on Japan paper. 

Post Svo, ornamental cloth, 288 pages $1.25 

Cunningham's story of Nell Gwyn is a standard, as the success of all 

the early editions testifies. This new edition at a popular price is sure 

to give satisfaction. It is beautifully printed from large, clear type, and 

makes a very handsome volume.

Svo, $1.00. 

This is the first substantial work published by Professor Pearson 
since his well-known " Ethics of Free Thought " appeared some years

scientific papers dealing with Chance in various aspects, from the 
Chances of Death to so-called Games of Chance, and points out how a 
mathematical theory corresponds with actual results. Another series 
of papers discusses problems of deep interest in connection with Woman 
and Labor, while a third section deals with important problems of mod- 
ern political progress.

FOUR REMARKABLE BOOKS. 

THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH. 

By GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO. Translated by ARTHUR HORN- 
BLOW. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 

"This book is realistic. Some say that it is brutally so. But the 
realism is that of Flaubert and not that of Zola. There is no plain 
speaking for the sake of plain speaking. Every detail is justified in the 
fact that it illuminates either the motives or the actions of the man and 
woman who here stand revealed. It is a painful book. Not that there 
is an absence of sunshine in it. But it is deadly true. The author holds 
the mirror up to nature, and the reader, as he sees his own experiences 
duplicated in passage after passage, has something of the same sensa- 
tion as all of us know on a first reading of George Meredith's ' Egoist.' 
Reading these pages is like being out in the country on a dark night in 
a storm. Suddenly a flash of lightning comes and every detail of your 
surroundings is revealed." New York Evening Sun. 

TALES FROM A MOTHER-OF-PEARL CASKET. 

By ANATOLE FRANCE. Translated by HENRI PENE DC Bois. 

16mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.25. 

" Anatole France is a literary artist. His delicately suggestive style 
is well reproduced in the translation of ' Tales from a Mother-of-Pearl 
Casket.' These sixteen stories are charming, neat, precise, and tender. 
The subjects range from the Golden Legend to the days of the Revolu- 
tionists. Nobody who has ever read ' The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard,' 
but will be delighted by the present volume." Philadelphia Prens. 

ANDRIA. A Novel. 

By PERCY WHITE, author of "Mr. Bailey Martin," "Cor- 
ruption," etc. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 
" Its plot is entertaining and the best of it is that it is creditably 

expressed." Albany Times-Union. 

DAYBREAK. A Romance of an Old World. 

By JAMES COWAN. With illustrations by WALTER C. GREEN- 

OUGH. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50. 

" It is the most remarkable book which has appeared from this part 
of the country since Edward Bellamy's famous ' Looking Backward,' 
and like that work it is a picture of a Utopia, but the perfected state of 
society which Mr. Cowan presents is not that of a Boston of the year 
2000, but that of an imagined Mars of the present day, an older and 
vastly more advanced world. . . ."Springfield Republican.

referred to, and give a reliable and chronological history of

AN EXQUISITE GIFT- BOOK. 

OPALS FROM A MEXICAN 
MINE. 

By GEORGE DE VALLIERE. Crown 8vo, set in French 
Old Style type, printed on antique-laid paper specially 
made for this edition, and daintily bound, $1.25. 
This volume consists of five stories illustrating the 
varied portents contained in the colors found in opals. 
They are written with rare delicacy of style, and the 
volume is especially recommended by the publishers to 
all who are in search of both an entertaining and hand- 
some Christmas gift-book. 



THE LURE OF FAME. 

By CLIVE HOLLAND, author of " My Japanese Wife," 
etc. With a Drawing and Decoration by GEORGE 
WHARTON EDWARDS. Large 16mo, square, hand- 
somely embossed cover, $1.00. 
CHARLES DEXTER ALLEN writes as follows in the 
Hartford Post : " Before one gets to the story itself, he 
must stop and admire the handsome setting the book 
has received. Bound in dark blue, with a bold cover 
design in gold, it has an especially designed title-page 
by George Wharton Edwards, and an excellent frontis- 
piece by the same artist. Its title, The Lure of Fame,' 
will suggest something of the thread of the story, but 
one is not thereby prepared for so tender and sympa- 
thetic a picture as those pages reveal, or so close an 
analysis of human feelings and experiences." 



FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. 

UNCROWNING A KING. 

A Tale of King Philip's War. By EDWARD S. ELLIS. 

Superbly illustrated by J. STEEPLE DAVIS. 12mo,

known writers of juvenile fiction. The story is pure 
in tone, yet thoroughly entertaining, and illustrates in a 
striking way the many trials and hardships endured by 
our forefathers in New England. 



NEPHELE. 

A Novel. By FRANCIS WILLIAM BOURDILLON, author 

of The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, the Day but 

One." 12mo, artistically bound, $1.00. 

" At the very first sentence the reader realizes that he 

is breathing a rarer air than usually emanates from the 

printed page, and at the very last sentence he realizes 

how he has been kept on the heights. . . . Whatever 

the cause, the achievement is the sort that revives one's 

faith in that quality which, for want of a better word, 

we know as inspiration." New York Sun. 

11 Nephele' is a unique and exquisite creation." 
Beacon (Boston). 

"Its witchery and grace are beyond criticism." 
Boston Times. 



OLD ENGLISH CUSTOMS EXTANT AT THE PRESENT TIME. 

An Account of Social Observances, Festival Customs, and Ceremonies yet surviving in Great Britain. By P. H. 

DITCHFIELD, M.A., Rector of Barkham, Berks. Crown 8vo, $1.75.

" In writing this book I have merely endeavored to describe

Hungary, and it must not be looked upon either as a scientific 
book of travels or a contribution to the eternal ' sex question.' 
Nor is it full of adventures and hair-breadth escapes. Things 
of that sort do not fall to the lot of a Nineteenth-century girl, 
even at the other end of Europe." Extract from Author's

"One of the Greatest Books of our Day." THE BOOKMAN. 

The Remarkable Historical Romance by the Author of " With Fire and Sword," 
depicting Rome at the time of U^ero and tbe Foundation of Christianity. 

"QUO VADIS." 

A Narrative of the Time of Nero. By HENRYK SIENK1EWICZ, author of With Fire 
and Sword," " The Deluge," etc. Translated from the Polish by JEREMIAH CURTIN. 

Crown 8vo, Cloth, $2.00. 



Grand in conception and marvellously vivid in detail. 
Public Opinion. 

As vivid and fascinating as " With Fire and 
Sword." Philadelphia Record. 

He reveals himself a master as truly in describing 
ancient Rome as in picturing the struggles of Poland. 
Congregationalism 

The pictures of life in Rome under the last of the 
Csesars is one of unparalleled power and vividness. 
Boston Home Journal. 

One of the most remarkable books of the decade. It 
burns upon the brain the struggles and triumphs of the 
early Church Boston Daily Advertiser. 

An historical novel of the first order, and in all re- 
spects a surpassing work of fiction. A consummate 
work of art, with all those qualities that go to the mak- 
ing of a memorable and notable book. N. Y. Herald. 

In the delineation of character, and in tracing the 
psychological developments of actual, living, breathing, 
human beings, the author of " Quo Vadis" shows an 
almost inimitable power. The portrait of Petronius is 
alone a masterpiece of which the greatest word-painters 
of any age might be proud. Philadelphia Church 
Standard. 

A marvellous succession of colossal cartoons, drawn 
with a free hand and glowing with dazzling colors. 
... If a person begins this book the torrential sweep 
of its immensity becomes instantly absorbing. It is one 
of the greatest books of our day. Mr. Curtin's trans- 
lation lacks little of the highest art. He may well be 
proud to have his name upon a book, which is perhaps 
the highest panegyric of the miraculous influences of 
Christianity that has appeared in modern times. The 
Bookman. 



Preeminent among the novels of the week is " Quo 
Vadis." The Outlook. 

A magnificent story, absorbingly interesting, brilliant 
in style Providence News. 

The hand which has fixed these historic figures on a 
canvas is the hand of a master. Milwaukee Sentinel. 

Interest never wanes, and the story is carried through 
its many phases of conflict and terror to a climax that 
enthralls. Chicago Record. 

One of the strongest historical romances that has 
been written in the last half century. . . . Equals 
"Hypatia," is as fascinating and as artistically con- 
ceived. Chicago Evening Post. 

A book to which no review can do justice; it is a 
most noble historical romance, in which the reader never 
for a moment loses interest. It is hardly possible to say 
too much in its praise. Detroit Free Press. 

A translation and a revelation as well. The clearest 
and most appreciable word-painting ever rendered by 
any writer, ancient or modern, of domestic and public 
life in Rome when the Christian religion began to make 
its earliest inroads upon the Pagan. We view, appalled, 
Rome, grand and awful, in her last throes. Boston 
Courier. 

Of intense interest to the whole Christian civilization. 
A tremendous subject and right grandly does the 
author rise to it. ... A masterly picture of Roman 
life at the critical moment when Christianity ceased to 
smoulder and began to blaze. . . . The world needs 
such a book at intervals, to remind it again of the sur- 
passing power and beauty of Christ's central idea. . . . 
A climax (the scene in the arena) beside which the 
famous chariot race in "Ben Hur" seems tame. 
Chicago Tribune. 



Readers familiar with the famous Slavic trilogy, With Fire and Sword," " The Deluge," and " Pan Michael," 
and who have learned to appreciate the remarkable artistic value of those famous romances, will doubtless have a 
feeling of regret on finding Sienkiewicz turning to Roman and classical scenes, as he does in his latest story, " Quo 
Vadis." Any regret that the reader may feel, however, is certain to vanish utterly when the full fascination of 
this marvellous romance is allowed to exercise its potent sway. ..." Quo Vadis " is assuredly a romance on a 
grand scale, and every chapter in it is eloquent with meaning. . . . Certain memorable scenes, like the feasting 
in the imperial palace, the burning of Rome, the rescue of Lygia, the Christian maiden, these will hold their 
place in memory with unfading color, and are to be reckoned among the significant triumphs of narrative art.

THE DIAL 



"JUST AS GOOD AS NEW." 



"AT YOUR OWN PRICE." 



GREAT SPECIAL OFFER. 

In making an inventory at the close of our recent Introductory Distribution, we find in stock a few sets of 
THE ENCYCLOPAEDIC DICTIONARY (in cloth and half Russia bindings) of which the sides only are 
slightly marred, not enough to impair their real value or appearance in your library, but sufficient to prevent 
their shipment as perfect stock at our regular prices of $42 to $70 a set. There being only a limited number 
of these sets, we shall not go to the trouble of rebinding them, but have decided to let them go on easy pay- 
ments of $1 down and $1 per month until paid for a little more than half our very low introductory price. 
BY PROMPT ACTION NOW, therefore, a number of ambitious and deserving readers of THE DIAL, who 
desire an up-to-date reference library, may now secure these special SETS AT ABOUT COST OF MAKING. 

Four massive volumes. Weight about 40 pounds. 50,000 Encyclopaedic Topics. 250,000 words denned. 
About 5000 Royal Quarto Pages. Cost $750,000 to produce. At once a Dictionary and an Encyclopaedia. 

WHILE THEY LAST they are yours for a lifetime this easy way: 

ONE DOLLAR DOWN AND A O ^ N D T O H L . LAR 

WE GUARANTEE that these volumes, except for slight rubs or abrasions on the sides, are precisely the 
same as those sold at full prices; yet we cannot offer them as perfect stock, and our loss shall be your gain. 
This is positively the Greatest Bargain ever offered in a strictly high-class standard publication. It can never 
be duplicated under any circumstances whatsoever. For those persons who are trying to " get along " with 
older and inferior reference works, this is a really wonderful opportunity. 



What the Encyclopaedic Dictionary Is. 

It contains over 250,000 DEFINED WORDS nearly 
twice as many as the largest "unabridged " and is now 
accepted as AN UNQUESTIONED AUTHORITY where- 
ever the English language is spoken. 

IT IS ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL ENCYLOP^J- 
DIAS, containing 50,000 encyclopaedic subjects ; the Brit- 
annica has only 27,000. JUST THINK OF IT ! The whole 
range of human knowledge condensed for your INSTANT 
USE by such world-famous scientists as Huxley, Proctor, 
and a hnndred other educators of hardly less renown ! It 
easily takes the place of any half-dozen other reference books 
that could be named. It is truly a FAMILY NECESSITY. 

IT IS AN ORNAMENT TO ANY LIBRARY; beau- 
tifully printed and substantially bound ; four great volumes, 
profusely illustrated, COSTING MORE THAN $750,000 
TO PRODUCE, and never before offered (except during 
our recent introductory sale) for less than $42 to $70 a set. 



What the Ablest Critics Say. 

" The Encyclopaedic Dictionary is a library condensed into 
four volumes ; a ton of diffusiveness reduced to forty pounds 
of quintessence." Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, March 
9, 1896. 

" It forms in itself a library for the busy man of affairs, 
the mechanic ambitious to advance himself in his line, or the 
student or apprentice just making a beginning." Scientific 
American, August 3, 1896. 

' ' For general use it has no superior. Of great professional 
value to clergymen, physicians, and lawyers." Ex-Judge 
Noah Davis, March, 12, 1895. 

"The work is undoubtedly an exceedingly useful and 
trustworthy one." Sunday-School Times, May 11, 1895. 

" The skill and judgment with which the dictionary and 
encyclopaedia have been blended can be appreciated only by 
comparing the Encyclopaedic with other dictionaries." 
Public Opinion, September 19, 1895. 



HOW TO SECURE THIS GREAT BARGAIN. 

Bring or send $1 to the Western Newspaper Syndicate, 269 Dearborn St., Chicago, and the entire set of four superb

payment of only $1. We refer to any newspaper in Chicago.

we are ggftjng re g u lar prices. We guarantee that the interiors and backs are not injured, and the

CO YEN TRY PA TMORE. 

Among the many suggestions from the busy- 
bodies of two continents concerning the vacancy 
made by Lord Tennyson's death in the Poet 
Laureateship of England, there was but one that 
deserved serious consideration. After it had 
become evident that neither Mr. Swinburne 
nor William Morris would be willing to occupy 
the vacant post, there was probably no other 
English poet among the living so deserving of 
the appointment as the author of " The Angel 
in the House." We believe it was " The Satur- 
day Review " that had the honor of putting 
forward the claims of Coventry Patmore for 
this distinction. How fortunate it would have 
been had the suggestion been heeded, became 
sufficiently obvious when the poetaster upon 
whose shoulders fell the ample mantle of Ten-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



nyson published his first official effusion. Since 
then, we are informed, it is an open secret in 
England that the injunction of silence has been 
laid upon the Laureate as far as his court func- 
tion is concerned, and that his attempts at offi- 
cial utterance are gently but firmly suppressed. 
How fittingly Coventry Patmore would have 
graced the position, and how worthily he might 
have carried on the noble tradition of his two 
immediate predecessors, we are now reminded 
by the news of his death, and by the review of 
his life-work that this sorrowful piece of intelli- 
gence naturally prompts us to make. 

Coventry Kearsey Deighton Patmore was 
born at Woodford, July 2, 1823. The son of 
a well-known editor and man-of-letters, he de- 
veloped at an early age a marked literary tal- 
ent of his own, and his first volume of " Poems " 
was published in 1844, the year of his majority. 
In 1847 he received an appointment as assist- 
ant librarian in the British Museum, and occu- 
pied a post in that institution for about twenty 
years. After his retirement he purchased a 
large estate in Sussex, and settled at Hastings, 
where he lived for the remainder of his life, 
and where he built a large Catholic church. 
As a contributor to " The Germ," in 1850, he 
was associated, in a way, with the Preraphael- 
ite movement, although hardly identified with 
it. Upon this point Buxton Foreman remarks : 
" Any novice who might be told that Mr. 
Coventry Patmore was a Preraphaelite poet 
would stare aghast if the informant, after giv- 
ing him samples of Mr. Patmore's work, should 
then turn to the poetry of Mr. D. G. Rossetti 
and say, ' This also is Preraphaelite poetry.' ' 
But Preraphaelitism has never submitted to ex- 
act definition, and if one corner of its mantle is 
stretched to cover such a poet as Thomas Wool- 
ner, another corner may fairly enough give 
shelter to Coventry Patmore. 

A second volume of verse, " Tamerton 
Church-Tower and Other Poems," was pub- 
lished by Patmore in 1853 ; and the year fol- 
lowing witnessed the appearance of a first 
instalment of " The Angel in the House," the 
poem by which he is best known. This work 
grew in volume year by year, and was revised 
over and over again to satisfy the fastidious 
taste of the poet, until in 1878 it had assumed 
a definitive form, in which " The Victories of 
Love " (published separately in 1863) was 
incorporated. Meanwhile, Patmore had written 
a volume of " Odes " (1868), " The Unknown 
Eros and Other Odes " (1878), and an essay 
on "English Metrical Law" (1878). We 



should also mention the fact that he edited the 
memoirs of " Barry Cornwall," and also " The 
Children's Garland," the latter an anthology 
prepared for the " Golden Treasury " series. 
Those who wish to study Patmore's poetical 
work as a whole should possess themselves of the 
final edition of 1886, in four volumes. Those, 
on the other hand, who are content to know the 
poet only in the quintessence of his production 
should seek the " Florilegium Amantis " vol- 
ume, edited by Dr. Richard Garnett, or the 
more recent " Poetry of Pathos and Delight," 
selected and edited by Mrs. Alice Meynell. 
Patmore died at Lymington, on the twenty- 
sixth of November, at the age of seventy-three. 
The enjoyment of Patmore's work, although 
very deep when once attained to, is to a certain 
extent the result of an acquired taste. It takes 
some effort and some power of penetration to 
discern the whole subtlety of his thought and 
the whole beauty of his imagination. He is, 
too, very uneven, and the reader who at the 
start chances upon certain pages in which bald- 
ness and triviality seem to reign supreme may 
well be repelled from further examination and 
too hastily conclude that the poet has no mes- 
sage for his ear. Suppose, for example, that 
the following lines first arrest the reader's eye : 

" While thus I grieved, and kissed her glove, 

My man brought in her note to say, 
Papa had bid her send his love, 
And would I dine with them next day ? " 

One might, indeed, have a good excuse for 
thinking the writer of such verse undeserving 
of any further attention. But let him persevere, 
and his reward will not be long delayed. He 
will soon come across such a passage as this : 

" And round her happy footsteps blow 
The authentic airs of Paradise," 

and the whole question will be settled. No one 
but a true poet could possibly have written those 
verses, or these : 

" The heartless and intolerable 
Indignity of ' earth to earth,' " 

or these called " The Spirit's Epochs ": 

" Not in the crises of events 

Of compass'd hopes, or fears fulfill'd, 
Or acts of gravest consequence, 

Are life's delight and depth revealed. 
The day of days was not the day 

That went before, or was postponed ; 
The night Death took our lamp away 

Was not the night on which we groan' d. 
I drew my bride, beneath the moon, 

Across my threshold ; happy hour ! 
But, ah, the walk that afternoon 

We saw the water-flags in flower ! " 

The essential purposes of Coventry Patmore 
find expression in his own verse, in this prayer, 
for example :

" Thou Primal Love, who grantest wings 

And voices to the woodland birds, 
Grant me the power of saying things 
Too simple and too sweet for words," 

and in the aim thus set forth : 

' ' Elated oft by such free songs 

I think with utterance free to raise 
That hymn for which the whole world longs 

A worthy hymn in woman's praise. 
A hymn bright-noted like a bird's, 

Arousing these song- sleepy times 
With rhapsodies of perfect words 

Ruled by returning kiss of rhymes." 

That he has done both of these things is beyond 
dispute. " The Angel in the House " sings the 
praise of woman in just such " a hymn bright- 
noted like a bird's," and almost every page of 
his work gives evidence of his gift for express- 
ing " things too simple and too sweet for words." 

" For even an hour 
To hold possession of the height 
Of nameless pathos and delight " 

is a power granted to but few poets in as 
marked a degree as to Coventry Patmore, and 
there are few more exquisite pleasures than to 
stand in spirit upon this very height of which 
he holds possession. The air is so tenuous that 
breath is difficult for one unaccustomed to the 
medium, but there is a sense of calm and spirit- 
ual freedom unattainable upon any lower level, 
and amply rewarding the effort of the climber. 
Those who have been lifted to this spiritual 
elevation by Patmore's song are very loyal to 
their poet. Mr. Buxton Foreman passes sober 
judgment in the following terms : " The lasting 
merit of his work is that it deals with love 
from the modern and domestic point of view 
in a manner that is at once manly, exquisitely 
refined, and wholly sincere and impassioned." 
Mrs. Meynell says : " Coventry Patmore's 
voice is single in his day, and single in our 
literature. It makes part of no choir loud by 
numbers, and so it needs an attentive ear. To 
that attentive ear it sounds alone, as the divin- 
est voice of our time." And Mr. Euskin, in 
the familiar passage that has probably done 
more than any other piece of criticism to send 
readers to Patmore, says to us : " You cannot 
read him too often or too carefully ; as far as 
I know, he is the only living poet who always 
strengthens and purifies ; the others sometimes 
darken, and nearly always depress and discour- 
age, the imagination they deeply seize." The 
poet who can evoke such tributes as these is 
not likely to be forgotten. While we may not 
group Patmore with the six major poets of the 
later Victorian period, his station is but just 
below their Olympus, and his shrine is no less 
secure than theirs. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE AUTHENTIC HISTORY OP THE 

JAPAN-CHINA WAR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your recent editorial article on the condition of lit- 
erary affairs in Japan has suggested to me that your 
readers might care to know that there has just been 
published at Yokohama a work which purports to be an 
" absolutely authentic " account of the recent war. Its 
title is " Heroic Japan," and it is the work of two au- 
thors F. Warrington Eastlake, Ph.D., and Y. Yamada, 
LL.B., Principal of the Chautauquan Association of 
Japan, both of whom are well qualified to write such a 
book. The authors claim that " not only have the Im- 
perial Household, Foreign, War, and Navy Departments 
given the authors free access to all documents, but 
every word in the book has been thoroughly and re- 
peatedly revised by the authorities concerned." It is, 
therefore, the first " precise, correct history of the war " 
which has yet been " published in any language," and 
has thus a special value to all students of history. It is 
valuable, moreover, as a record, not only of the general 
history of that war, so important, but also of a great 
many " brave deeds " of individual officers and soldiers, 
and of small bands of the Japanese army. As the au- 
thors say in the preface, " there is one phase of bravery 
which seems peculiar to this country. It is this, and 
this alone, which we have tried to emphasize and thus 
bring to the notice of the world." Such " simple and 
unassuming " deeds illustrate " the qualities of martial 
heroism, implicit soldierly obedience, unflinching sense 
of duty, noble unselfishness, and deathless courage " 
which go to make up the well-known " spirit of Japan" 
( Yamato-damashii) . 

The book contains about 570 pages and 127 illustra- 
tions and maps; is well printed, and sells for five yen. 
Its publishers are Messrs. Kelly & Walsh, Yokohama. 
Although the stories of " brave deeds," and the reiter- 
ated fulsome praise, become rather monotonous, yet the 
book is interesting, and merits a wide circulation in 
Occidental countries. It shows the staying qualities of 
the soldiery who must maintain the position of Japan as 
the key of Asia." ERNEST W. CLEMENT.

A SONNET OF LOVERS. 



Men have loved women after many ways: 
Purely, as Dante, making love a prayer 
For Beatrice; in a wild despair, 

As Petrarch loved, who sang for Laura's praise; 

With strong desire that stained with crime their days, 
As Antony, or Abelard, to dare 
Caesar or God ; or as that one who bare 

His Argive Helen Ilium's towers to raze. 

Kingdoms and states, honor and faith, have stood 
Unshaken till some fatal moment when 

A woman's smile, alluring, shone above, 
O'er-dazzling fame or valor, wealth or good. 
Priest, scholar, warrior, so they be men, 
In every age they sell their souls for love.

MK. LANG'S LOCKHART.* 



It is fitting that the life of the best British 
biographer since Boswell should be exception- 
ally well-written ; and we are glad to say that 
Mr. Lang's " Life of Lockhart " is, what we 
hoped it would be, a fit shelf-companion for his 
hero's own magnum opus. Mr. Lang has now 
tried his hand at about every sort of book- 
making, save lexicography. His " spoor," as a 
recent bard rather ungraciously grumbles, is 
"over every mortal thing"; and it is only natural 
if his later work has heretofore shown occasional 
signs of the jaded brain and the reluctant pen. 
But this time he has found a theme to his taste. 
Lockhart was an interesting (we do n't say en- 
gaging) member of a remarkably interesting 
circle one that has left posterity a richer 
legacy of racy personalia than perhaps any 
other literary circle or congeries of literary 
circlets whatsoever. Walter Scott, Jeffrey, 
Wilson, Croker, Maginn, Gait, De Quincey, 
Ballantyne, Murray, Constable, Byron, Tom 
Moore, Hay don, Hunt, Keats, Hazlitt, Cole- 
ridge, Southey, Wordsworth ! these are 
surely names to conjure memory with ; and Mr. 
Lang pursues his task with the zest (if not the 
animus) of a Jeffreyan Scotch reviewer on the 
trail of an English bard. His table of contents 
(a conveniently full and ingeniously enticing 
one) is better reading than many a man's book. 

Mr. Lang's book, we learn, grew out of the 
publisher's wish that he should prepare an edi- 
tion of Lockhart's life of Scott. The introduc- 
tory chapter to that work swelled into the 
present biography. The documents used in its 
preparation are, chiefly, the Abbottsford and 
Milton Lockhart MSS., mainly eleven volumes 
of letters to Lockhart, and his own letters to 
members of his family ; letters of Lockhart to 
his life-long friend, Mr. Jonathan Christie (of 
Chalk Farm memory) ; an article by Mr. Gleig 
in the " Quarterly Review " (the sole authority 
on Lockhart's boyhood) ; letters of Lockhart 
to Carlyle, Dean Milman, Professor Wilson, 
Sir W. Laidlaw, and others. Mr. Lang re- 
grets the necessary omission of certain let- 
ters, notably those from Lockhart to Croker, 
which " may some day be given to the world," 
and a series to Southey (of slight importance

we fancy) which he has been unable to trace. 
Enough letters and to spare are, however, given 
to enable the reader who does not care to ac- 
cept Mr. Lang's conclusions unquestioned to 
descry for himself the moral lineaments of Sir 
Walter's much-canvassed and in life somewhat 
aloof-keeping and inscrutable son-in-law. Lock- 
hart assuredly did not wear his heart upon his 
sleeve, nor did he, as man or as reviewer, suffer 
fools gladly. As the world saw him, he was 
reserved, stiff, satirical, one who habitually 
harbored more scorn than charity for the foi- 
bles of men. Strangers mistrusted " the laugh 
aboot the sere wed-up mouth of him, that fules 
ca'd no canny, for they couldna thole the 
meanin' o't." Of his inborn turn for ridicule and 
mischief there can be no doubt ; and the work 
he sometimes put his hand to consorted ill with 
his " Hidalgo airs." But he was never (even 
in his Edinburgh Flegeljahre * ) the coldly 
malignant literary bravo, the " Scorpion " critic 
contemporary fancy painted him. He was cer- 
tainly not a man who would, as a competent 
judge said of his yoke-fellow Croker, " go a 
hundred miles through sleet and snow, in a 
December night, to search a parish register for 
the sake of showing that a man was illegitimate, 
or a woman older than she said she was." 
Croker wrote as if he hated his victim ; Lock- 
hart never did. Croker's raillery sprang from 
sheer love of inflicting pain ; Lockhart's from 
a natural turn for banter. In fact, Lockhart 
went on carelessly and light-heartedly from 
youth to middle age, caricaturing his oppo- 
nents, his friends, and himself ; and the habit 
bore its natural fruit. Many who were hit dis- 
liked him for it ; and many who were not hit 
disliked him because they feared they would 
be. Still, we do not think Lockhart was in 
general an amiable man, or that his early 
" squibberies " in Maga were altogether free 
from malice. But he has certainly been painted 
many shades blacker than he deserved to be. 

To be misjudged of the world is the common 
fate of shy men ; and Lockhart was, by all ac- 
counts of him, his own included, as shy as a wild 
duck. " I am," he once wrote, " the shyest 
man alive." Now of shyness there are two 

* In 1838 Lockhart wrote to Haydon, as to his early perform- 
ances in " Black wood ": "In the first place I was a raw boy, 
who had never had the least connection either with politics 
or controversies of any kind, when, arriving in Edinburgh in 
1817, I found my friend John Wilson (ten years my senior) 
busied in helping Blackwood out of a scrape he had got into 
with some editors of his Magazine, and on Wilson's asking me 
to try my hand at some squibberies in his aid, I sat down to do 
so with as little malice as if the assigned subject had been the 
Court of Pekin."

main varieties : that which springs from tim- 
idity, and that which is wedded to pride of the 
stiffest and touchiest order. Lockhart's was of 
the latter sort. He himself once (in a moment 
of introspection probably) neatly described 
shyness as " arrogance not screwed up "; and 
the definition seems to us to go to the root of 
his own character. He was essentially the shy, 
proud man ; the " unclubable " man, who (how- 
ever cordial and companionable in his family 
circle or with an intimate friend or two) be- 
comes straightway as responsive as a polyp and 
as enlivening as a tombstone in general com- 
pany. This outwardly frosty (yet, for all one 
usually knows, inwardly friendly and even 
jovial) creature is no rara avis. We have all 
met him, and been benumbed by him, and 
wished ourselves (and him) in a warmer vicin- 
ity. Addison, tradition says, was much such a 
man. Of course the world judged Lockhart 
as it saw him calling him, as Redding says 
in his Memoirs, " ill-natured, sarcastic, and I 
know not what besides." We suspect Lock- 
hart, who cared as little as any man for Mrs. 
Grundy's opinions, did not chafe much under 
these imputations. Mr. Lang notes that Lock- 
hart's customary manner was oddly blended 
with a certain turn for conviviality. This sav- 
ing trait (manifest often enough at college 
revels and bacchanalian suppers with Wilson 
and the " Shepherd ") sometimes unexpectedly 
broke through his habitual crust of " almost 
fierce reserve," to the wonder of all beholders 
not his intimates. Such an occasion is cited by 
Mr. Lang: 

" It is remembered that he once came unexpectedly 
to Milton Lockhart, when a great dinner of farmers was 
going on, that at first he shrank into his shell with 
Hidalgo airs, or to speak Scottice, ' with the black dowg 
on his back.' Suddenly, when the sweets appeared, one 
of the yeomen pinched him violently on the leg, and in 
a voice hoarse with emotion, murmured, ' Gosh, man ! 
Two, puddens ! Yon '11 be a kick abune the common.' 
This unexpected assault and enthusiasm sent John off 
into a hearty fit of laughter. He shook off the black 
dog, and, for the rest of the evening, was the life and 
soul of the party." 

In fine, the world at large saw little of Lock- 
hart but his failings. Those who knew him 
best loved him most ; and these have testified 
to his essential truthfulness and high-minded- 
ness, to his readiness to make sacrifices for 
others, to his loyalty to old ties of friendship 
and affection, and to his generosity even to stran- 
gers in their hour of need. These high qualities 
were crossed and veiled by certain asperities 
of manner and temperament ; and unfortu- 
nately the circumstances of his entry into what 



was then very literally the arena of letters were 
such as to call those asperities into full and 
mischievous play. The impression made by 
Lockhart on people not wholly strangers to him 
is thus described in the well-known " Times " 
article on him, which is, we think, rightly 
ascribed to Mr. Elwin (editor of the " Quar- 
terly "), though Mr. Lang seems to favor the 
more common attribution of it to Dean Milman 
or Lady Eastlake : 

" It was characteristic of Lockhart's peculiar individ- 
uality, that, whenever he was at all known, whether by 
man or woman, by poet, man of business, or man of the 
world, he touched the hidden chord of romance in all. 
No man less affected the poetical, the mysterious, or the 
sentimental; no man less affected anything; yet as he 
stole stiffly away from the knot which, if he had not 
enlivened, he had hushed, there was not one who did not 
confess that a being had passed before them who had 
stirred all the pulses of the imagination, and realized 
what is generally only ideal in the portrait of a man." 

The same article affords us a glimpse of the 
less gracious Lockhart : 

" Those whose acquaintance he was expressly invited 
to make, would find no access allowed them to his 
mind, and go disappointed away, knowing only that they 
had seen one of the most interesting, most mysterious, 
but most chilling of men, for their very deference had 
made him retire further from them." 

Comparing Scott with Lockhart, the same 
writer continues : 

" In outward manner no two men indeed could be 
more different. Scott, frank, easy, accessible, the least 
awful great man ever known. . . . Lockhart, slow at 
first, retiring, almost repelling, till the thaw of kindly 
or friendly feelings had warmed and kindled his heart. 
But in tastes, in political principles, in conviviality, in 
active life, in the enjoyment of Scottish scenery and 
sports, in the love of letters for letters' sake, with a 
sovereign contempt for the pedantry of authorship, 
warm attachments, even in the love of brute beasts 
there was the closest sympathy." 

Of Lockhart the critic, the same writer con- 
cludes forgetful for the moment of his hero's 
unhallowed pranks at the expense of the " Lak- 
ers " and the " Cockney School ": 

". . . yet if any great work of genius appeared, it was 
one to him his kindred spirit was kindled at once, his 
admiration and sympathy threw off all trammels. We 
have known where he has resisted rebuke or remon- 
strance, to do justice to the work of political antago- 
nists that impartial homage was at once freely, boldly, 
lavishly paid." 

The spectacle of one Scot standing up for 
another is no novel one ; and Mr. Lang, while 
admitting pretty freely his hero's imperfections, 
is confessedly his advocate where advocacy is 
called for which is pretty often. Lockhart's 
course as a reviewer for " Blackwood " is ex- 
tenuated rather than defended. Touching these

[Dec. 16, 



iniquities, or levities, of his client's, Mr. Lang 
says, passim : 

" For too many years Lockhart has been made the 
solitary scapegoat of Wilson, and of Blackwood in gen- 
eral. ... To love of mischief, of freedom to indulge 
caprice, to friendship for Wilson, and regard for Mr. 
Blackwood, one may most plausibly attribute Lock- 
hart's stormy, and often regretted, but never broken 
constancy to Maga. ... He began to write too young, 
he enjoyed a latitude far too wide, and he had, in Wil- 
son, an elder associate and friend whose genius was 
perhaps the most unbalanced in literature. . . . His 
pleas of youth, of association with an elder friend who 
should have set him a better example, and of freedom 
from personal malice, may be accepted even by severe 
judges. . . . When all this is done there abides an 
amount of wrong that is not to be palliated, not to be 
smiled away." 

To these special pleas may be added the 
general one that " they all did it." The literati 
of the day were given to abusing one another 
like theologians ; and young Lockhart only 
followed the model set him in the all-powerful 
" Edinburgh " by the great Jeffrey (vide the 
review of "Christabel"), the Whig Aristarchus 
and " first of British critics." Even Coleridge 
wrote of Maturin's "Bertram" which had 
superseded his own " Zapolya " at Covent Gar- 
den as 

". . . this superfetation of blasphemy upon nonsense, 
this felo de se and thief captain, this loathsome and 
leprous confluence of robbery, adultery, murder, and 
cowardly assassination, whose best deed is the having 
saved his betters from the degradation of hanging him, 
by turning Jack Ketch to himself." 

Mr. Lang admits that Lockhart was " con- 
stitutionally a mocker "; and we find no reason 
to doubt that the latter, when he tried his 'pren- 
tice hand at literary scurrilities in " Ebony," 
went willingly and even gleefully to work. 
That he had no little natural aptitude and 
inclination for the task certain early letters of 
his indicate. They indicate also, to our think- 
ing, that the young Oxonian ("mischievous 
Oxford puppy," honest Hogg called him) was a 
just bit of a prig, and a rather sourly sarcastic 
one at that. No liberal sweet-dispositioned 
youth, however literate, would, for instance, 
have gratuitously styled Bristol " an abomin- 
able stinking stye of artisans," as Lockhart did 
in a letter to Christie. Indeed, artisans and 
trades-people generally the young man (who, 
be it added, could boast, besides his brilliant 
acquirements, the proverbial Scotch " ell of 
genealogy ") seems to have regarded with some 
disdain. After returning to Glasgow he wrote 
gloomily to Christie : 

". . . It is really a miserable thing to be without 
friends ; out of my own family I have not a soul here I 



care for. The manners of men who talk perpetually of 
calicoes and raw sugar, and of chemical-botanical vul- 
gar women, are intolerable to me. I am fain to take 
all my walks in solitude," etc. 

Glasgow manners are again fleered at in a 
subsequent letter : 

". . . T' other day I went to a Glasgow ball, almost, 
I may say, for the first time. On entering the room a 
buzz of ' sugars,' ' cottons,' ' coffees,' ' pullicates,' assailed 
my ears from the four winds of heaven. Every now 
and then the gemmen were deserting their partners, and 
rushing into the caper course to talk over the samples 
of the morning. One sedulous dog seemed to insist on 
another's putting his finger into his waistcoat pocket. 
The being did so, and forthwith put the tip to his lips, 
but the countenance was so mealy that I could not tell 
whether it smacked of sugar or Genseng." 

After settling at Edinburgh, Lockhart wrote 
to Christie in his characteristic vein of the then 
swarming literati of that city : 

" Certainly if the name Athens had been derived from 
the Goddess of Printing not from the Goddess of 
Wisdom no city in the world could with greater jus- 
tice (than could Edinburgh) lay claim to the appella- 
tion. An author elsewhere is a being somewhat at least 
out of the common run. Here he is truly a week-day 
man. Every other body you jostle is at least the father 
of an octavo or two, and it is odds if you ever sit down 
to dinner in a company of a dozen, without having to 
count three or four quarto makers in the circle. Poets 
are as plenty as blackberries indeed much more so, 
unless blackberries mean sloes. And as for travellers 
good Jehovah! I think I am safe in saying that there 
have appeared at least twenty different lucubrations in 
that way concerning Paris alone within these last eigh- 
teen months. Old crambe-recocta stuff out of Horace 
Walpole and Sir Joshua spouted by one boy of eigh- 
teen who had never in his life seen but one or two Edin- 
burgh exhibitions and profound disquisitions on na- 
tional character and Napoleon by another, who never 
had seen the tenth milestone from Auld Reekie, or read 
anything better than Jeffray and Cobbett's Parliamen- 
tary Debates. . . ." 

The same letter contains a literary note of 
some interest : 

"... I dined the other day at his (Sir W. Hamil- 
ton's) house in company with two violent Lakers 
Wilson for one, and a friend of his, a most strange crea- 
ture, for the other. His name is De Quincey; he was 
of Worcester. After passing one half of an examina- 
tion which has never, according to the common report, 
been equalled, he took the terror of the schools, and fled 
for it to the Lakes. There he has formed the closest 
intimacy with Wordsworth and all his worthies. After 
dinner he set down two snuff-boxes on the table ; one, I 
soon observed, contained opium pills of these he swal- 
lowed one every now and then, while we drank our half- 
bottle apiece. Wilson and he were both as enthusiastic 
concerning the ' Excursion ' as you could wish. . . ." 

Lockhart's character is not, of course, to be 
judged mainly in the light of the foregoing 
youthful effusions. We have cited them merely 
as showing a certain natural predisposition in 
him for the work he did as a young man in

The brilliant, sarcastic, somewhat flippant tyro 
who, in Maga, pointed his wanton quill at the 
" Cockney School " and the " Lakers " (many

later frankly acknowledged), was, as ample evi-

from his twenty-eight years' management of 
the " Quarterly." Mr. Lang's estimate of Lock- 
hart, as man and as writer, seems to us in the 
main as just as it is thoughtful and impartial. 
He has given us a delightful book ; and it is 
with regret that one takes leave of its pleas- 
antly diversified pages. In point of biograph- 
ical material, there has been almost an embar- 
rassment of riches ; and Mr. Lang has sifted 
and marshalled his documents most satisfac- 
torily. The work may perhaps be styled (as 
Carlyle styles Lockhart's " Scott ") not so much 
a composition as a compilation well done ; but 
the pages in which Mr. Lang appears as author 
proper, rather than editor, are by no means the 
least readable ones. He has plainly the right 
Caledonian turn for biographical writing ; and 
we trust that, now his hand is in, he will give 
us more of it ere long. Outwardly the volumes 
are very handsome even luxurious. There

CURTIS ON THE CONSTITUTION.* 



After an interval of forty years from the 
appearance of the first portion of Mr. George 
Ticknor Curtis's treatise on the Constitution, 
which was republished in 1889 as Volume I. 
of the " Constitutional History of the United 
States," the material left by him is now pub- 
lished as Volume II., under the editorship of 
Mr. Joseph C. Clarkson. Notwithstanding 
this lapse of time, the new volume is distin- 
guished by the same pleasing style which was 
such an acceptable feature of the former work. 
But as regards substance, there is great dis- 
parity between the two volumes. The earlier 
one treats of what may be considered as but

George Ticknor Curtis. In two volumes. Volume II. Ed- 
ited by Joseph Culbertson Clarkson. New York : Harper 
& Brothers. 



one epoch in our constitutional history that 
of the formation and adoption of the consti- 
tution. The text of the new volume, cover- 
ing the succeeding period of upwards of eighty 
years, occupies but little more than half the 
space of the first volume, and discusses a part 
only of the important constitutional questions 
that have arisen during that period. The 
author did not plan this volume upon a scale 
proportionate to that of the first ; and it was 
never completed according to his original plan. 
Some disappointments in the treatise will there- 
fore be felt by those who would have been 
pleased to see a complete constitutional history 
from the pen of Mr. Curtis, following the 
plan of his first volume, and expanding, if 
necessary, into four or more volumes. His 
minuteness of explanation and lucidity of illus- 
tration would have enlivened many of the 
naturally dry episodes of our national history. 
It is a matter of regret, not only that he did 
not live to finish his work as he had planned 
it, but that it had not been laid out on a more 
generous scale and executed accordingly. But 
in so far as Mr. Curtis has, in this supple- 
mental work, taken up and discussed the con- 
stitutional questions of the period, he is, as 
usual, instructive and entertaining. The mea- 
greness of such discussions is in part compen- 
sated for by the addition of a group of con- 
stitutional documents of the highest value, 
including the Non-importation Agreement of 
1774, the Address to the King of the same 
year, the Declaration of the Congress to the 
army in 1775, the Ordinance of 1787, the 
Tariff Act of 1789, the provisional and final 
Constitutions of the Confederate States, and 
a reprint of Mr. Paul Leicester Ford's excel- 
lent Bibliography of the Constitution. A col- 
lection of these documents, with the Declara- 
tion of Independence, the Articles of Confed- 
eration, and the annotated Constitution of the 
United States, as found here, would, if printed 
by itself, find ready acceptance by the public, 
and their insertion as an appendix to Mr. 
Curtis's work is most timely, and will insure 
hearty commendations to the learned editor of 
the new volume. 

Disregarding chronological order, Mr. Cur- 
tis discusses by " groups " several subjects as 
they have presented themselves at various 
times since the inception of our system. The 
changes in current opinion concerning the 
nature of our constitutional system are traced 
in a generalized way. The question of the 
extent to which the " league of friendship " of 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



the Confederation period gave place to a na- 
tional government is well illustrated by the 
calm and judicious comments of the author, 
who cleverly shows the weaknesses in the argu- 
ments advanced by the " State Sovereignty " 
school of writers. Both the friends and the 
opponents of the constitution, when it was 
under consideration, agreed that the proposed 
new system would substitute a nation for a 
league ; and, as our author points out, while 
in later years theorists have advanced extreme 
views in regard to State sovereignty, delegated 
powers, nullification and secession, still the 
administration of the government in all its 
departments, legislative, executive, and judi- 
cial, has continuously proceeded upon the lines 
of the national theory, as expounded by its 
friends in 1787-1789. But the theories of 
the secession school are unsatisfactory and de- 
ceptive in themselves. They are confuted by 
the plain provisions of the Constitution and 
the mode and circumstances of its adoption. 
The ratifications of the national constitution 
by the people of the original Thirteen States 
were unqualified and unconditional, without 
either express or implied reservation of a right 
to revoke. The people of South Carolina, 
like those of several other States, accompanied 
their adoption of the constitution with a pro- 
posal for immediate amendments, thus evinc- 
ing their understanding, not only that their 
ratification was unconditional, but that the 
instrument thus adopted could be changed 
only in one of the modes provided by itself. 
President Jackson's position in reference to 
nullification, and the terms of his proclama- 
tion to the nullifiers, are warmly commended 
by our commentator, while the grounds of his 
veto of the charter extension of the United 
States Bank are criticised with a fine discrim- 
ination, showing that the President misapplied 
a constitutional rule which might have been 
properly invoked had the facts been different. 
In a very clear and happy manner, Mr. 
Curtis explains the dual character of our con- 
stitutional system, and illustrates the merits 
of both its national and local departments, 
and the mode in which each has contributed 
to our national success. But he is not uni- 
formly clear in his analysis, and his discussion 
of the question as to who were the " People 
of the United States " that ordained and 
established this dual system, is vague, and 
reaches no apparent result. He does not 
agree with the current opinion that that " Peo- 
ple " were the mass of those inhabiting and 



acting jurally in all the Thirteen States ; and 
he seeks to find confirmation for his views in 
the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall, in 
McCulloch vs. Maryland. Referring to the 
adoption of the constitution by the conventions 
of the people, assembling in their several States, 
Marshall assumed the entire propriety of that 
mode of action, but said that the measures thus 
adopted " do not, on that account, cease to be 
the measures of the people themselves, or be- 
come the measures of the State governments ; 
the government proceeds directly from the peo- 
ple." Mr. Curtis is quite clear that the adop- 
tion of the constitution was not a measure of 
" the State governments." He repudiates the 
" State sovereignty " theory in unequivocal 
terms, and emphasizes the features in which 
the States have been made subordinate to the 
Federal government. But he seems to draw 
the inference, without stating it in terms, that 
the establishment of the system was the work 
of thirteen separate and distinct " peoples." 
Marshall, however, spoke not of " peoples," 
but of " the people," evidently entertaining no 
other idea than that of one people, operating 
at once in thirteen groups, to effectuate one 
common object. It is perhaps with this idea 
of thirteen separate peoples in mind, that Mr. 
Curtis refers to some of the provisions of the 
constitution as " compacts and agreements " 
between the States. He says : " The idea of 
compacts, covenants, and agreements, between 
the separate States, as members of the Union, 
and the United States as the representative of 
all the States collectively, is embedded in the 
Federal Constitution and forms its principal 
strength." In this he puts himself in direct 
conflict with Mr. James Wilson, whose views 
he praises without stint in his first volume, and 
who said that he saw no trace of compact in 
the constitution. Nor does it seem easy to 
make these declarations of Mr. Curtis consist 
with his statement, in this new volume, that 
" the process of amending the constitution 
seems scarcely reconcilable with the hypothesis 
that the constitution is a compact between in- 
dependent sovereign States." A clear and 
unequivocal statement of a logical deduction 
from the text and the history of the constitu- 
tion, may be found in Wilson's opinion in 
Chisholm vs. Georgia : " We may then infer 
that the people of the United States intended 
to bind the several States by the legislative 
power of the National Government." The 
authoritative command of a lawful sovereign 
rises far above the grade of a compact.

The territorial clause of the constitution, the 
government of the territories and the admis- 
sion of new States, are subjects which Mr. 
Curtis uses skilfully as leading up to a consid- 
eration of the debates on the Missouri question, 
the compromise which resulted, the Dred Scott 
decision, the slavery controversy, and the civil 
war. Other cognate questions are discussed, 
among them the reconstruction measures, which 
are freely criticised. But space cannot be here 
given for further extracts from his text. The 
subject of the disputed election of 1876, and 
the settlement effected by the Electoral Com- 
mission, lies so well out of the field of consti- 
tutional interpretation that in a treatise like 
this it might be properly dismissed with a brief 
reference to that fact. The account here given 
of the party schemes and operations which pre- 
ceded the creation of the Electoral Commission, 
and which is borrowed from a partisan book 
on the subject, is out of place in the constitu- 
tional treatise of a jurist. 

The constitutionality of protective tariff leg- 
islation is earnestly maintained and forcibly 
advocated by Mr. Curtis; and the history 
given by him of the inception and consumma- 
tion of the first tariff act under the constitution 
shows that at the beginning of our revenue leg- 
islation the element of protection to American 
industry was considered a proper incident of a 
tariff for revenue, and that its entire constitu- 
tionality was assumed. The 4th of July, 1788, 
being the first national anniversary after the 
Constitution had been ratified by the necessary 
number of States to give it effect, was signal- 
ized by a public parade in Philadelphia, in 
which the workers in the mechanic arts exhib- 
ited mottoes indicating their expectation that 
among the first fruits of the new system would 
be the adoption of protective legislation ; and 
the next following national anniversary was 
distinguished by President Washington's ap- 
proval of the first tariff act, which in terms 
embodied the protective theory.

THE new Thistle " edition of Mr. J. M. Barrie's 
writings is published by subscription by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. In appearance it closely resembles the 
recent editions of Stevenson and Eugene Field also 
published by this house. There are to be eight volumes, 
each illustrated with two photogravures. Each volume 
is to have a specially-written preface by Mr. Barrie. 
" Auld Licht Idylls " and " Better Dead " form the first 
volume of this edition, and the second gives us the 'pren- 
tice story, " When a Man 's Single." 



A HASH ADVENTURE.* 

That man is deserted by his good angel who 
begins to write a " History of Oratory and 
Orators " with no adequate idea of history and 
only the most general conception of oratory. 
Such a man is naturally compelled to fill up 
his book with the third element namely, ora- 
tors. Then if he have no gift of style, but, in 
place of it, access to a number of works on the 
subject, he will be likely to produce a book 
something like Mr. Henry Hardwicke's. 

It seems absurd, even painful, that a man 
should offer the public a good-sized book on 
some subject, who manifestly has, not merely 
no respectable knowledge of the matter itself, 
but no conception even of the purport of his 
title. And yet, so far as this book informs us, 
Mr. Hardwicke has no idea of oratory as dis- 
tinct from the persons who delivered orations, 
and no idea of history as distinct from chrono- 
logical sequence. Such being the case, it is 
hardly worth mentioning that he is not espe- 
cially well-read in his subject, although he 
makes large quotations with infrequent mention 
of their sources ; that he has such ideas on his- 
tory that the treatise on oratory by the contem- 
porary of Theseus, and the oration pronounced 
by Romulus at the bidding of his grandfather, 
are mentioned (pp. v., 25) in the same spirit 
as the works of Burke and Webster ; that his 
only notion of criticism is to apply the words 
"vigorous," "florid," "vehement," "brilliant," 
" ornamental," etc., or else to extract from 
Goodrich and others ; and that in all other re- 
spects he is wholly unequal to the creditable 
carrying out of the task he has imposed upon 
himself. His work is a history of oratory in 
three respects only : it deals with orators ; it 
recognizes a time-element ; it treats in separate 
chapters the orators of Greece, Rome, France, 
England, and America. 

So far, the reader may rest well assured as to 
what this book is not : to give something of an 
idea of what it is, I shall offer an extract about 
Sulpicius, an account of Mr. Hardwicke's deal- 
ings with Demosthenes, and a few remarks on 
his chapter on oratory in America. 

First, as to Sulpicius, one of the few cases 
where our author does not depend chiefly upon 
long extracts from authorities often unnamed. 
I omit four sentences, which, however, do not 
concern oratory : 

" At this time, it may be safely said that he became

one of the greatest villains in Rome, although that city 
could boast of a large assortment of villains at this con- 
juncture. Cruel and avaricious, he committed without 
hesitation the most criminal actions. It is said that he 
sold by public auction the freedom of Rome to foreign- 
ers, telling out the purchase money on counters erected 
in the Forum for that purpose. He kept three thou- 
sand swordsmen about him in constant pay, ready on 
any occasion to do his bidding, and these he called his 
anti-senatorian baud. While Marius was in power, Sul- 
picius, as tribune, transacted all public affairs by vio- 
lence and force of arms. He decreed to Marius the 
command in the Mithradatic war. With his band he 
attacked the consuls while they were holding an assem- 
bly of the people in the temple of Castor and Pollux, 
and deposed one of them. Sylla, however, having at 
length gained the ascendency, Marius was expelled, and 
Sulpicius was put to death in the bloom of his youth 
and beauty, justly punished for the many crimes which 
he had committed. Notwithstanding his villainy he was 
endowed with great oratoric powers. It is said that he 
was the most lofty, and what Cicero called the most 
tragic, orator of Rome ; that ' his attitudes, deportment, 
and figure were of supreme dignity ; his voice was power- 
ful and sonorous; his elocution rapid; his action variable 
and animated " (pp. 34, 35). 

As to Demosthenes, having alluded to the 
usual anecdotes, our author says : " Demos- 
thenes, despising the affected style of the ora- 
tors of his day, chose Pericles as his model ; 
hence the chief characteristics of his style were 
strength and vehemence." He then gives the 
historical circumstances under which Demos- 
thenes' orations were delivered, adds quotations 
from the first Philippic and from the oration 
On the Crown, and follows with quotations from 
Goodrich and four unnamed writers, to which 
he adds the comparison of Longinus between 
Demosthenes and Cicero.* He then proceeds 
to his own criticism. " One of the most notice- 
able excellences of Demosthenes is the colloca- 
tion of his words "; the secret of his success 
was that he was an honest man and a patriot ; 
the chief characteristics of his oratory were 
" strength, energy, and sublimity, aided by an 
emphatic and vehement elocution." This ac- 
count may appear confused, but it is no more 
so than Mr. Hardwicke's. 

Passing rapidly over Oratory in England 
(noting merely that it takes up almost half the 
book, that a third of it is devoted to Erskine, 
and that of this about half is taken up with 
legal matters having no particular connection 
with oratory), we come to Oratory in America. 
There is no attempt to deal with the subject, 

* When, however, Mr. Hardwicke says that Longinus speaks 
of the eloquence of Demosthenes as " a clap of thunder that 
overturns all things," he imputes to that inspiring but sane 
author a piece of folly which he would have put into the fourth 
chapter of the "Treatise on the Sublime" rather than the 
twelfth. 



beyond a page or two at the beginning : the 
chapter is made up of disconnected sketches of 
thirteen American orators. Of the character 
of these sketches some idea may be gathered 
from the author's statements (in different 
places) that John Randolph of Roauoke was 
" one of the most remarkable men that ever 
lived in any age "; Edward Everett, " one of the 
most graceful and polished speakers of modern 
times "; Daniel Webster, " one of the greatest 
political and forensic orators that ever lived in 
any age or country "; Rufus Choate, " one of 
the greatest orators and statesmen this country 
has produced "; and Thomas Corwin, " one of 
the greatest natural orators that ever lived in 
America." Such critical epigrams, sandwiched 
in between anecdotes which are generally inter- 
esting, extracts from other books on the subject, 
and passages from orations, make up a piece of 
work which, however amusing in different ways, 
can hardly be regarded as a serious work on the 
subject which it assumes to treat.

RECENT STUDIES IN ECONOMICS.* 

Professor Hadley presents us, in a work of less 
than five hundred pages, with a treatise covering 
the entire field of political economy. Some por- 
tions of the subject have, from the nature of the 
case, received brief treatment, but it is never hasty 
or careless. The usual division of the subject into 
the departments of production, exchange, distribu- 
tion, and consumption, has been abandoned. The 
first chapter discusses " Public and Private Wealth"; 
then follows one on " Economic Responsibility," 
which treats of slavery, property, emancipation, the 
persistence of poverty, the Malthusian theory, poor 
relief, and compulsory insurance. The succeeding 
chapters deal with competition, speculation, invest- 
ment and combination of capital, money, credit, 
profits, wages, machinery and labor, cooperation, 
protective legislation, and government revenue. 
Such treatment produces the impression that the 
book is rather a series of essays than a systematic

treatise upon economics. No thread of connection 
between the parts can be traced beyond that indi- 
cated in the sub-title, " The Relations between Pri- 
vate Property and Public Welfare." The author 
aims to occupy the position of an arbiter rather than 
that of an advocate ; and while he has been unable 
at times to break away from his strong conservatism, 
he has maintained his position with moderate suc- 
cess. He is quite right in insisting that a separation 
between economic theory and economic practice is a 
mistake, and his combination of the two has produced 
a work of increased value to the student and of very 
much greater interest to the general reader. Yet 
his use of history is frequently questionable. We 
are led to doubt whether he really appreciates the 
fact that conditions are changing, and that the 
problem of to-day and that of twenty-five years ago 
must be approached from different standpoints. 
That a proposed remedy proved ineffectual in earlier 
years is not prima facie evidence that such a remedy 
is inadequate to meet the present difficulties. That 
the Potter law of 1874, for example, failed to meet 
the need for railroad legislation in Wisconsin, does 
not prove that such legislation, in the light of pres- 
ent needs, is to be condemned without a hearing. 
Such a disposition of the question is apt to lead to 
the impression that the author has used historical 
material to force the conclusion he desires to make. 
We are not surprised to find that Professor Hadley 
adheres to most of the so-called " orthodox " posi- 
tions in economic theory, after a careful discussion 
of the attacks that have been made upon these posi- 
tions. He recognizes at the very beginning of his 
discussion that new problems in modern business 
life have arisen in connection with large invest- 
ments of capital in factories and railroads, where 
free competition becomes an impossibility ; thus 
necessitating a closer study than formerly of the 
effect of combinations upon the interests of the con- 
sumers and of the laborers. Socialism must be 
dealt with as " a series of practical measures urged 
by a large and influential body of men who are en- 
gaged in extending the functions of government." 
Yet, though frankly recognizing the limits to the 
principle, the book is in general an argument in 
favor of individual freedom. While very many will 
not agree with Professor Hadley's positions, all must 
admit that the book is a valuable contribution to the 
science of economics. 

Professor Taussig, in his book on " Wages and 
Capital," has made a scholarly addition to the lit- 
erature of economic theory. The work is a discus- 
sion of the vexed question of the relation of capital 
to wages. The author maintains that real wages 
are paid from the product of past labor, not from 
that of present labor. Present labor chiefly pro- 
duces unfinished things ; but the reward of present 
labor is finished things. Capital is inchoate wealth, 
possessions that do not yet serve human wants ; and 
it includes all goods still in the stage preparatory to 
final enjoyment. Goods remain capital, do not 
become income, until they emerge from the shop- 



keeper's hands. Hence the source of real wages 
exists in the form of capital at the time when the 
work is done. When hired laborers alone are con- 
sidered, the wage-earners can be said to be depend- 
ent upon a wages fund. Their money income is 
derived from what the capitalists find it profitable 
to turn over to them. This, however, applies only 
to the relations of certain kinds of laborers to the 
modern capitalists. It excludes a large class of 
independent laborers, and hence bears not at all on 
the permanent and unalterable relation of real cap- 
ital to real wages. The question of the elasticity of 
the wages fund is considered from two points of view : 
as to the source of the real wages of all laborers, 
and as to the source of the money wages which hired 
laborers receive from employers. The sources are 
roughly predetermined, but so elastic as ';o assist 
not at all in the solution of practical problems. The 
wages-fund doctrine will be found likewise of little 
assistance in the solution of questions of strikes, 
trades-unions, combinations, and the like. These 
questions concern themselves with particular wages, 
not with wages at large. Again, the importance of 
the wages-fund doctrine in the discussions on distri- 
bution, and especially in the recent discussions upon 
the residual share, has been exaggerated. The doc- 
trine has rather to do with production than distribu- 
tion. " Wages may come from capital or from pro- 
duct, may come from a rigid or an elastic fund of 
capital ; whatever the answer, it will throw light 
only on the machinery by which their remuneration 
is secured, not on the nature and relative strength 
of the powers which move the machinery." The 
remainder of the volume is taken up with a keen 
analysis and history of the wages-fund doctrine from 
the time of Adam Smith down to the present, includ- 
ing a valuable chapter on contemporary discussion. 
Professor Smart of Glasgow, through his trans- 
lations of the writings of the Austrian school and 
his independent writings along the same line, has 
come to be recognized as the leading exponent of 
those writers among English-speaking peoples. His 
recent book, " Studies in Economics," is but another 
proof of his right to hold this position. There are 
ten essays in all four studies in wages, three in 
currency, two in consumption, and a closing discus- 
sion on the place of industry in the social organism. 
The theory of wages is an attempt to reconcile the 
old " cost " theory and the new "productivity" 
theory. Wages are determined by the value of 
labor, which is a conduction backward from the 
value of the product of labor. But labor has a 
" cost " which is equivalent to the value of its pro- 
duct in some other line of production, ultimately in 
agriculture ; and this forms a true irreducible me- 
dium from which wages may be increased. An im- 
portant conclusion drawn from the discussion is that 
as wealth in most countries now increases more rap- 
idly than population, wages tend to rise. Not only 
is the national dividend larger, but the worker gets 
a larger share of it. Hence the weakness of the 
Malthusian argument. The studies in currency will 



380 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



be of especial interest to American readers at this 
time. The chapter entitled "Must Prices Fall" 
presents clearly the fact that a general fall of prices 
can only take place when currency is scarce. Indi- 
vidual prices fall from improvements in means of 
production, but tend to rise again as similar improve- 
ments extend over the field, demand being stim- 
ulated not only by decrease in price but also by 
increase in purchasing power. The discussions on 
consumption are perhaps the most interesting of all, 
for we feel that this much-neglected subject is find- 
ing through the writings of Professor Smart and the 
Austrians its proper place in the science of econom- 
ics. The studies in this subject aim to show that 
the function of consumption in economic life is to 
maintain and hand on wealth while supporting the 
worker. The mode of consumption is the all- 
important thing. Owners of wealth, by a more un- 
selfish consumption, could benefit others as well as 
themselves, and could keep in the world immense 
sums of wealth that are now thoughtlessly destroyed. 
" It needs nothing but the will to allow each of us 
to socialize his consumption and throw open the 
doors of our house of wealth to humanity." 

Mr. Davenport's " Outlines of Economic Theory " 
follows in general the lines laid down by the Aus- 
trian writers. Man is the centre of the science. 
Demand is the fundamental motive power, and the 
minimizing of sacrifice the primary law. Cost of 
production is marginal producer's sacrifice. In his 
discussion of distribution, the author asserts the 
tendency toward an increasing proportional impor- 
tance of rent, a probable fall in interest, a fall in 
the rate of profit as the requisite ability for man- 
agement becomes more general, and a consequent 
increase in benefits to the wage-earners as a class 
and to society as a whole. The theory of distribu- 
tion is similar to that of President Walker, differ- 
ing with his presentation only in the extent to which 
the reduction of profits goes to the increase of wages. 
Interesting applications of the general theory are 
made to practical economic problems. In the dis- 
cussion of the incidence of taxation, the principle 
is laid down that no change in the direction of 
industrial activity will be worked by taxation un- 
less the amount of the tax be sufficient to more 
than cancel the margin of difference between em- 
ployments. A tax on commodities, for example, 
increases the selling price only to the extent that 
it increases the marginal sacrifice of production. 
Ordinarily, such a tax is paid in part from the pro- 
ducer's and in part from the consumer's rent. A 
tax on profits, again, will be shifted only to the 
extent that the relative advantages of different em- 
ployments are over-balanced by the imposition of 
the tax. The book is interesting in its application 
of the Austrian theory to practical questions, but 
makes no material contribution to the theory of the 
subject. 

In his little volume entitled " Strikes and Social 
Problems," Professor Nicholson has collected twelve 
essays and addresses of a popular character, eight 



of which have before appeared in print. The first 
six treat especially of the conflicts between labor 
and capital. The first three essays, entitled " Strikes 
and a Living Wage," " Labor Combinations and 
Competition," and " Profit Sharing," are pleas for a 
policy of concilation and arbitration, and attempt to 
show that the policy of combination as often carried 
out is suicidal. " The Living Capital of the United 
Kingdom " and " Capital and Labor, their relative 
Strength " are studies taken from the author's book 
on Money and Monetary Problems. " A Plea for 
Industrial Liberty " and " The Reaction in favor of 
the Classical Political Economy " present in concise 
form the individualistic position of the author, a 
position which manifests itself throughout the vol- 
ume. The essays are of very uneven merit. 

" A General Freight and Passenger Post," by 
Mr. James Lewis Cowles, is an attempt to solve the 
railroad problem by the adoption of the plan now 
governing our postal system. He proposes to throw 
out of consideration entirely the element of distance, 
and to charge a uniform rate for all services of a 
similar character. On page vi. of the preface, we 
find : " The whole business of public transportation 
should be pooled under the control of the Post- 
office, and the rate charged for the shortest distance 
for any particular service (the cost of service rate) 
should be adopted as the uniform standard rate for 
that class of services for all distances, within the 
limits of the Postal system." The author assumes 
at the start that the cost-of-service theory underlies 
our postal system, an assumption which is by no 
means self-evident. If this theory is the underlying 
one, why do not newspapers and packages pay a 
higher rate than letters? The expense attending 
the handling of the former is certainly greater. As 
a matter of fact, the charge is made according to 
what the traffic will bear, a theory which the 
author many times condemns. The true theory 
underlying our postal system is the social-utility 
theory ; and had Mr. Cowles defended his railroad 
scheme on that ground, he would have merited a 
hearing if he had not won acquiescence. The cost- 
of-service theory is a wholly false one to employ in 
the making of railroad rates. It is impossible to 
determine the cost of shipping a single commodity 
or of transporting a single passenger. To ignore 
distance as an unimportant element in the determin- 
ation of cost, is unsound. What proportion of oper- 
ating expenses is to be assigned to terminal ex- 
penses, and what to the expense of the haul, cannot 
be determined until government statisticians have 
secured a more real control over railroad book- 
keeping ; but that the hauling expenses are too large 
an item to be ignored, is certain. Again, the author 
proposes to place all goods in two or three simple 
classes, abolishing the elaborate system of classifi- 
cation now in use. The result would be that heavy 
goods which demand a low rate to be moved could 
not be hauled at all. If the rates were made low 
enough to move these heavy and cheap goods, the 
receipts from all hauls would not be sufficient to

pay operating expenses. The only logical theory of 
rate-making is that which bases rates upon value, 
those goods which are better able to pay for the 
haul being charged a rate that will compensate for 
the lower rates on low-grade goods. Government 
ownership is not made a necessary part of the 
scheme at the beginning, but the author thinks it 
should soon follow to make the plan a complete 
success. He fails, however, to tell us the steps by 
which this is to be carried out. He neglects to dis- 
cuss the financial difficulties in the way of govern- 
ment purchase, and the political difficulties arising 
under government ownership. He says nothing of 
the industrial revolution that would follow the inaug- 
uration of such a policy. Yet in spite of the insu- 
perable difficulties to the working out of the scheme, 
he says : " What took three years in the era 1837 
1840 [referring to the ' Penny Post '] ought to be 
accomplished now in as many months. It is surely 
within the limits of possibility that when the twen- 
tieth century opens the scheme set forth in this book 
may be American law, and may be in full operation, 
within the limits of the United States." Altogether 
the " solution " is too visionary to deserve serious 
consideration. FRANK HAIGH DIXON. 



HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS.

Messrs. A. C. Armstrong & Son's superbly ap- 
pointed edition of M. Gre*ard's " Meissonier, His 
Life and Art," translated by Lady Mary Loyd and 
Miss Florence Simmonds, forms an ideal gift-book 
of the more sumptuous and impressive order. The 
work is in one royal octavo volume, uniform with 
Dr. Ricci's " Correggio " and M. Emile Michel's 
" Rembrandt " ; and it makes, we should think, 
thanks to its subject, a stronger bid for popular 
favor on this side the water than either of its pre- 
decessors. It contains some two hundred illustra- 
tions in the text, printed in black and tint, and forty 
full-page plates, partly in photogravure and partly 
in color, reproducing all the master's more famous 
works. The plates are finely done, and they form 
a series, not only very attractive, but of rare edu- 
cative value to art students. Meissonier was, in 
point of delicacy and precision of manipulation, 
probably the most consummate technician since the 
days of Dow, Metzu, and Mieris ; and the con- 
noisseur or the student of drawing may profitably 
linger over the exquisite pen and pencil sketches 
and studies sprinkled through the text of this noble 
volume. Meissonier's life lends itself well to the 
biographer, and M. Gre*ard is an admirable one. 
He sets forth the diversified story of the painter's 
career in a series of sketches, drawn chiefly from 
the latter's own self-revelations in familiar talk and 
letters, the biography proper occupying about one- 
half of the volume. The remainder consists of 
extracts from Meissonier's note-books, together with 
a series of notes from his conversations, due to the 



devotion of the lady who eventually became his 
second wife. These pensees, ranging over a variety 
of themes, literary, artistic, social, political, often 
reveal a depth and keenness of perception that ef- 
fectually refutes those inclined to deny intelligence 
of a high order to the great French genre painter 
for genre, we take it, was, after all, Meissonier's 
real province. True, he inclined in later life toward 
a more synthetic and dramatic order of composi- 
tion even toward the imaginative or the " grand " 
style; but no one, we fancy, who compares his 
rather commonplace and bombastic efforts in this 
walk of art (his semi-allegorical bit of pictorial 
bathos, entitled " Paris, 1870-1871," a piece re- 
calling the grotesque flights of Fuseli and his school) 
with such flawless gems of execution and expres- 
sion as "La Sixe," "The Sergeant's Portrait," 
"The Connoisseurs," etc., and the many spirited 
single figures and detached groups vignetted in the 
volume before us, can doubt on which side Meis- 
sonier's genius lay. Biographically, the work seems 
to us complete. His career Meissonier has thus 
summed up : "I have known great poverty and 
great luxury, an obscure beginning and a brilliant 
end." As to his glory he exclaims, " I care little 
for it ! It gives me as much delight to stand be- 
fore a Rembrandt, as to say ' it was I who painted 
that.' If my name were destined to obscurity, and 
I knew it, I should nevertheless put all my heart 
and soul into my work ! " But he observes else- 
where, and with perhaps deeper sincerity : " No 
artist would take up the brush, if he knew no liv- 
ing being would ever see his picture. Ask Emile 
Augier whether he would write plays if no one 
read them but himself." Meissonier's last years, 
if they were shadowed by great griefs, were bright- 
ened by great joys. His works, awaited eagerly 
by the amateurs of two worlds and bought long ere 
they had left the easel, had become almost price- 
less. When one of them by a rare chance passed 
out of the hands of its owner, it was competed for 
"in a manner unparalleled in the case of any 
painter, living or dead." " What a history," he 
exclaims (1880), "is that of nay Cuirassiers/ It 
was first bought for two hundred and fifty thousand 
francs, then sold at Brussels for two hundred and 
seventy-five thousand ; on a certain Thursday the 
owner was offered a profit of one hundred thou- 
sand francs on his bargain, and on the Friday it 
was carried off in triumph. Scarcely had the case 
been opened after the arrival of the picture in Paris, 
when a collector came in, looked at it, and bought 
it on the spot for four hundred thousand francs, 
with this graceful speech: <Tell M. Meissonier 
that this work, which has been restored to France, 
shall only leave my collection for the Louvre.' 
The first owner, who, after enjoying the picture 
for two years, made a profit of a hundred thousand 
francs without lifting a finger, is not to be pitied." 
Meissonier is often compared with Terburg and 
Metzu; but the most illustrious Hollander, even 
Dow or Mieris, has scarcely his miscropic tenuity

of touch. He attained, said Charles Blanc, " the 
highest style of the art of painting grandly in 
little." M. Gre*ard's book, in the opulent setting 
bestowed upon it by its present publishers, forms 
the leading art-work of the season ; and we con- 
gratulate in advance those who shall be fortunate 
enough to number it among their Holiday gifts. 

A magnificent example of elegantly ornate book- 
making is " France Under Louis XIV., Its Arts, 
Its Ideas " (Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons), 
translated from the French of M. Emile Bourgeois 
by Mrs. Cashel Hoey. The text is based primar- 
ily on Voltaire, and secondarily on such memoirists 
as Saint-Simon, Dangeau, Mme. de SeVigne", La- 
bruyere, Ormesson, Choisy, Mesdames de Motte- 
ville, Lafayette, Spanheim, Lavalliere, etc. The 
pictorial attractions of the work are so unique and 
diversified as to fairly baffle accurate description. 
The author's aim seems to have been to make his 
book a literary and pictorial mirror wherein one 
may see reflected the men and manners of Le 
Grand Sikcle. When Voltaire conceived his Essay 
on the century of Louis XIV., he did not purpose 
to undertake the general and political study of the 
reign. As a man of letters, rather than a historian, 
his plan involved a picture, not a narrative, of the 
preceding epoch. To portray the men and manners 
of that century " the most enlightened that has 
ever been " was his proposal. This he failed to 
do ; but of all his work he seems to have valued 
most highly the portion now brought before us; 
his anecdotes of the King and Court ; the picture 
of ideas, arts, and creeds, of the effect of the gov- 
ernment on conduct and conditions. " I regarded," 
says M. Bourgeois, " the removal of this picture of 
the Great Century from the frame in which it was 
afterwards placed by Voltaire, so as to restore its 
value and its perspective, as all the more legitimate, 
because it supplies a certain means of serving, by 
his aid, the same cause that he served ; the cause 
of the Frenchmen who made France so great two 
hundred years ago. This volume has no other pre- 
tension, claim, or reason for existence." To com- 
plete the picture of the Great Century drawn for 
us by Voltaire and the memoirists, the aid of its 
art has been invoked. The art of the seventeenth 
century, judged usually by the formal decorations 
of Versailles, its ceilings and panels and clipped 
yew trees, has not been sufficiently interrogated. 
The profusion of beautiful examples of this art 
reproduced in the volume before us well bear out 
the opinion of M. Bourgeois that " Closely exam- 
ined, it is living, bright, highly finished, full of the 
grace and charm of the purely French genius which 
produced it. A number of these illustrations are 
portraits engraved on copper, and these form a 
superb series. Of the illustrations in general it may 
be said that they are beautifully executed through- 
out, and on a scale of profusion unequalled in any 
other publication of the season. Of especial inter- 
est are the numerous cuts after the old engravers 
and the engravers are, of all artists, the most valu- 



able to students of the reign of Louis XIV. Their 
art, which reaches its height in Mellan, Morin, 
Nanteuil, Chauvan, Edelinck, etc., is not limited to 
great compositions and portraits, but lends itself to 
subjects of every kind, scenes of everyday life, 
architectural views, fashion prints, designs for fur- 
niture, almanacs, and caricatures ; hence its high 
illustrative value. M. Bourgeois's work is mag- 
nificently mounted, as it deserves to be, and pre- 
sents altogether a regal appearance. To scan its 
beautifully printed pages, with their wealth of thor- 
oughly effective and pertinent illustrations, is to be 
transported at once to the glittering (if not all 
golden) days of the Sun King. 

Mr. Ford M. Hueffer's life of that strong yet all 
too abstruse and bizarre painter, Ford Madox 
Brown, is not, strictly speaking, a " Holiday Book "; 
but the lavish pictorial allurements and attractive 
exterior given it by its publishers (Longmans) may 
perhaps warrant us in treating it as such for the 
nonce. Ford Madox Brown (1821-93) was an 
older member of the Rossetti-Hunt coterie, though 
not actually a member of the famous " P. R. B." 
As he himself expressed it, he was, "if not an 
actual Pre-Raphaelite Brother, an aider and abet- 
tor of Pre-Raphaelitism." His eccentric yet im- 
pressive canvases denote a strongly original turn of 
mind, a facile style, a good technic, a taste by no 
means flawless, and a riotous fancy. They are 
essentially his own and the fruit of no formula, 
academic or schismatic, though unmistakably tinged 
with the spirit of Botticelli and the men of the 
earliest Italian Renaissance. Of the works of Ford 
Madox Brown it may be said with peculiar truth 
that they are caviare to the general though the 
qualification must be added that the attitude to- 
ward them of " the general " is apt to be one not 
so much of distaste, still less of indifference, as of 
lingering, puzzled curiosity. Of these works the 
volume before us contains a profusion of examples, 
most of them full-page autotypes of excellent qual- 
ity. The many reproductions of studies and prep- 
aratory sketches are of much interest. Brown was 
an interesting personality, and he was a member of 
an interesting circle made up chiefly of the leading 
London artists and literati of the day ; hence his 
biographer has had plain sailing, so far as making 
a readable book is concerned. It is easily one of 
the most entertaining of recent artists' biographies, 
and it sheds some valuable side-lights on the mooted 
characters and aims of the ardent little band of art- 
reformers whose leaders were Millais, Rossetti, and 
Holman Hunt, and whose apostle was the eloquent 
Ruskin. The cover design shows a delicate com- 
bination, in light tints on a ground of cream white, 
of conventionalized foliage gracefully blended and 
interlaced about a panel in light-blue and gold. 

Mr. Francis T. Underbill's " Driving for Pleas- 
ure " (Appleton) supplies in a very thorough and 
satisfactory manner the long-felt want of a book 
treating directly of the proper appointment of 
sporting and non-sporting vehicles and " turnouts " 



1896.] 



THE DIAL

of every description, from the elaborate four-in- 
hand coach and park " drag " to the " buckboard." 
The author speaks with authority, his qualifications 
for the task including, we are told, " not only twenty 
years of driving, but also a long service as judge at 
horse shows, which has furnished unlimited oppor- 
tunities for the study and comparison of equipages." 
To this abstruse branch of research, with its vari- 
ous ramifications, Mr. Underbill has clearly applied 
himself with an energy and a nicety of discrimina- 
tion equal to that which the late Mr. Macallister 
used to bring to the investigation of questions of 
social etiquette and cuisine. So far as our rather 
limited vision in these matters can discern, he has 
left untouched no considerable question as to what 
constitutes " good form " (which, be it added, 
usually corresponds, in his acceptation of the term, 
to good sense and sound taste) in equipage and its 
appointments and belongings in harness, liveries, 
horse-clothing, stables, stable-furnishings, and so on. 
In fine, actual or prospective owners of horse vehi- 
cles of any and every description and degree of 
elaborateness or of simplicity, who wish their equip- 
ages to be appointed tastefully, correctly, and in 
accordance with the dictates of expert experience, 
may find in Mr. Underbill's book a most valuable 
guide and vade-mecum on the subject. The vol- 
ume is very handsomely made up and profusely 
illustrated with photographic plates. The binding 
is a very suitable and tasteful combination (mod- 
estly " horsey " in its suggestions) of brown levant 
and undressed leather, with gilt side-stamp repre- 
senting carriage-whip, etc. For a friend of eques- 
trian tastes the book would form a specially elegant 
and acceptable gift. 

Mr. John Dennie's admirable work on " Rome of 
To-day and Yesterday," the very best book of the kind 
ever written, is now issued by the Messrs. Putnam 
in a handsome third edition, furnished with five maps 
and plans, and fifty-eight illustrations from Roman 
photographs. Mr. Dennie has long been a resident 
of Rome and a careful student of her antiquities. 
Conscious of the difficulties in the way of acquiring 
knowledge in this special branch of research that 
beset him in his own early Roman days, he has pre- 
pared a book specially designed to smooth for others 
the arduous path he himself has travelled. He has 
thus brought together in a volume of moderate 
dimensions the results of his own wide reading, and 
of his prolonged and leisurely examination of the 
ruins of ancient Rome. To the wealth of historical 
lore and august memories locked from the unini- 
tiated in these fragmentary yet still colossal relics 
of a storied past, his book forms a most convenient 
key. Rome is, as Mr. Dennie says, " par excellence 
the great historic city "; and in her ruins lies written 
in decipherable characters the history of her eleven 
Pagan centuries. " To explain, in some measure, 
what the Roman ruins mean, when and why these 
buildings were erected, enough about each building 
and each builder to link the whole eleven centuries 
into one continuous story," is the ostensible object 



of Mr. Dennie's book. Its style is at once animated 
and scholarly ; and while it is primarily intended 
for the more intelligent class of general readers, 
even specialists must be impressed with the wealth 
of information condensed within its 355 pages. 
Rome of to-day is comprehensively treated in the 
opening chapter, the remainder of the work being 
devoted to Rome of yesterday. Signer Anderson, 
from whose photographs most of the illustrations 
are printed, has displayed rare taste and judgment 
in placing his camera few of the views being open 
to the charge of triteness, while none of the main 
objects of historical and archaeological interest are 
slighted. The book is neatly and solidly bound in 
grass-green linen, with back and quarter sides of 
white buckram. Print, paper, and general finish 
are unexceptionable. 

An excellent idea is embodied in the J. B. Lip- 
pincott Co.'s set of four . trim volumes entitled 
"Half-hours of Travel at Home and Abroad," 
compiled by Mr. Charles Morris, and it has been 
well carried out. The work consists of selected 
travel-pictures, geographically classified, drawn from 
the writings of a great many travellers representing 
many countries, the aim being to tell the story of 
the world, alike of its familiar and its unfamiliar 
portions, as displayed in the narratives of those 
who have seen its every part, and .particularly of 
those who were early visitors to previously unknown 
lands, and whose descriptions are therefore those 
of discoverers. The volumes thus afford a sort of 
comprehensive bird's-eye view of the globe as seen 
through the eyes of rarely competent observers; 
and they should prove a real boon to those fond of 
the literature of travel and adventure, yet lacking 
the means or the opportunity to read in extenso the 
many excellent works which that literature now 
contains. Mr. Morris has made his selections with 
much taste and judgment, showing a due regard 
both for literary quality and for the educative side 
of the general plan of the work. The first volume 
is devoted to " America," the second to " Europe," 
the third to " Asia," and the fourth to " Africa and 
Australia." In the first there are fifty-two selec- 
tions ; in the second, fifty-two ; in the third, forty- 
seven ; in the fourth, forty-six. Each volume con- 
tains six half-tone plates. The authors represented 
are, like the " other attractions " of the average 
theatrical poster, " too numerous to mention "; but 
they are all worthy of the place accorded them. 
The volumes are very well made, their low price 
considered; and they form an altogether capital 
Holiday gift of the more useful and solid sort. 

In his " Naval Actions of the War of 1812 " 
(Harper), Mr. James Barnes tells in a very direct 
and spirited fashion the story of those famous ac- 
tions and sea- duels that are, or should be, to an 
American heart what Trafalgar and the tale of the 
Armada are to an English one. Mr. Barnes's 
narrative is well adapted to stir in the reader a 
glow of generous patriotism and a proper sense of 
national esprit de corps, without at the same time

fostering a spirit of animosity toward our erstwhile 
foe. One may surely glory in the deeds of a De- 
catur, a Bainbridge, or a Perry, and still be many 
degrees removed from the Jingo or the Anglophobe. 
The nineteen papers in the volume tell the story of 
thrice that number of sea-fights, from the general 
actions of fleets, down to the detached exploits of 
single cruisers and privateers. They have been 
compiled from official records, and from files and 
volumes of private correspondence ; and are hence 
of considerable historic and biographic value. The 
book is attractively made, the chief pictorial feat- 
ure being Mr. C. T. Chapman's twenty-one illus- 
trations in color, which may be considered approxi- 
mately faithful studies of the scenes they represent. 
There are also a number of cuts of medals awarded 
by Congress to victorious naval commanders. 

" A Book of Country Clouds and Sunshine " 
(Lee & Shepard) is the somewhat indefinite title of 
a series of papers on New England town and coun- 
try life, by Mr. Clifton Johnson, who also furnishes 
the illustrations. Mr. Johnson is very much at 
home with his theme, and plainly writes con amore. 
His descriptions are fresh and natural, and have the 
right "down East" (or "daown East") tone, as 
have his pictures. Among the latter may be noted 
such homely yet apposite scenes as " Sawing Ice," 
" Washing up for Dinner," " Working over Butter," 
" Washing Day," " Paring Apples," " Filling the 
Silo," " Husking Corn," Topping Onions," and the 
like ; while other more poetic, if not more charac- 
teristic, ones represent choice bits of New England 
landscape. The book is, first and foremost, about 
the farmer and his ways, and about village life and 
character ; and its main drift may be gathered from 
such titles as " A Winter Ride," " Town Meeting," 
" A Hill-Town Sabbath," " A Christian Endeavor 
Meeting," "The Farm Day by Day," etc. The 
author is (theoretically at all events) quite in love 
with the phase of life he depicts. A pleasant New 
England village (" not too far removed from a large 
town and the railroad") is, he holds, "the best 
dwelling-place in the world." Perhaps so ; but we 
think Mr. Johnson's qualification an essential one. 
Many persons look back on some remote New En- 
gland farm or village with sentimental fond regret ; 
but they do n't go back (at least not to stay) not 
even when their " pile is made," and their hand is 
free, and their final abiding-place is a matter of 
choice. No : they love to dream of the old days of 
youth, and health, and sweet content, and simple 
bucolic toils and joys, and to prose about them re- 
gretfully for the edification of politely skeptical 
friends and family. But they stick to the city ; and 
are laid away at last not in the far-away rustic 
graveyard where the rude forefathers of their na- 
tive hamlet sleep but in a spacious marble- 
streeted necropolis not too remote from the bustling 
scene of their earthly activities. Three of Mr. 
Johnson's papers are reprinted from " The Out- 
look," " The Congregationalist," and " The Cosmo- 
politan " respectively ; but the remaining eleven, we 



take it, now appear for the first time. The book is 
both comely and readable. 

Mr. William Winter's pleasant travel-book, " Gray 
Days and Gold," is likely to enjoy a renewed lease 
of popularity in the new illustrated edition of it 
issued by the Macmillan Co. The text has been 
carefully revised by the author, who has corrected 
certain errors of date and statement that crept into 
the original edition. The chapters on Clopton 
and Devizes have been considerably expanded, the 
record of Shakespearian affairs at Stratford has 
been augmented, and an effort has been made to 
render the style more flexible and concise. Mr. 
Winter's book presents the best American account 
since Irving of rural England ; and it well merits 
the pains he has bestowed upon it, as well as the 
more opulent setting in which it now appears. There 
are one hundred illustrations, full-page and text, in 
woodcut and process. The subjects selected are 
germane to the text, consisting of literary shrines 
and portraits, rural and urban views of historic or 
literary interest, etc. The volume is full-gilt, and 
chastely bound in bluish gray, with a thistle design 
in gilt tracery over all. The work now forms the 
choicest of guides and the most inspiring of com- 
panions to American travellers inclined to view a 
trip to England, not as a mere holiday jaunt to the 
world's great pleasure - mart and common Vanity 
Fair, but as in some sort a religious pilgrimage to a 
fatherland graced with a thousand historic shrines 
and august ancestral memories. 

Sheridan's "School for Scandal" and "The 
Rivals " are issued together in one of the tasteful 
green-and-gold " Cranford " volumes (Macmillan 
Co.), so deservedly popular with seekers of choice 
yet moderate-priced Holiday books. The artist this 
time is Mr. Edmund J. Sullivan, who furnishes a 
number of drawings of fair average quality. Mr. 
Augustine Birrell writes a rather lengthy introduc- 
tion on Sheridan, taking for his starting point Mr. 
Fraser Rae's recent Life of that much canvassed 
and (we are inclined to think) much fibbed-about 
genius. Mr. Birrell, while admitting the merits 
of Mr. Rae's book on the whole, inclines to take 
issue with him, in that he, having persuaded him- 
self that the traditional Sheridan is a false Sher- 
idan, sets himself at work to construct an entirely 
new one. We do not ourselves think Mr. Rae has 
gone this far ; but we quite agree with Mr. Birrell 
(as we have no doubt that Mr. Rae would do), 
when he says : " For my part, were I ever to be 
the biographer of a famous man long dead, I would 
never quarrel outright with a tradition. Temper 
it with charity, modify it with time, make ample 
allowances for jealousies and contending vanities, 
still ampler for sheer inventiveness ; but this done, 
the stream of tradition, thus purified, which has 
trickled down to you, however far removed it may 
be from the truth, is far more likely to be nearer 
that shy commodity than anything you are in the 
least likely to concoct for yourself." Mr. Rae has 
not, we believe, departed so widely from this sound 



1896.]

principle as Mr. Birrell seems to imply. Sheridan's 
two delightful comedies may be read with new de- 
light in this neat and convenient volume. 

The recent death of George Du Maurier gives 
peculiar acceptability to a volume of his drawings 
just published (Harper). The work is an oblong 
quarto, and is entitled " English Society." The 
drawings are reprinted from " Harper's Magazine," 
in which they have appeared during the past ten 
years. Mr. Howells contributes a charming intro- 
duction, in which he discourses upon Du Maurier's 
fiction, taking it as the supreme example of the 
" kind capable of expressing an engaging beauty, 
and bewitchingly portraying many phases of life, 
which comes smiling to you or (in vulgar keeping) 
nudging you, and asking you to a game of make- 
believe." Of this sort of fiction, Mr. Howells de- 
clares : " This novelist, who wrote no fiction till 
nigh sixty, is the greatest master who ever lived, 
and I do not forget either Sterne or Thackeray 
when I say so." Of course we must make much 
allowance for the very uncritical exuberance that 
marks the pronouncements of Mr. Howells when- 
ever his feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of 
any book or writer, but this sketch, or essay, re- 
mains a very pleasant thing, and fitly prefaces a 
collection of the drawings that so gently satirize 
the foibles of modern fashionable life. The book 
is one of the most attractive of the year. 

Good taste and good workmanship are not lack- 
ing in the Macmillan Co.'s " Book of Old English 
Ballads," illustrated with decorative drawings in 
the Pre-Raphaelitist manner by Mr. George Wharton 
Edwards, and furnished with an Introduction by 
Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie, who is, we presume, re- 
sponsible for the selections. Mr. Edwards's draw- 
ings, while they are of rather uneven merit, rank 
well as a whole (thanks to such fine plates as those 
facing pages 32, 56, 124, and 177), and harmonize 
duly with the spirit of the text. Mr. Mabie's Intro- 
duction is a rather lengthy and nicely discrimina- 
tive dissertation on the nature and origin of the 
ballad in general. The selections are made with 
taste, and embrace such sterling old favorites as 
"Chevy Chace," "Annan Water," "Barbara 
Allen," " Fair Margaret and Sweet William," 
" Young Waters," " The Twa Corbies," The Nut- 
brown Maid," " The Banks o' Yarrow," " Sir Pat- 
rick Spens," the indispensable Robin Hood trio, etc. 
There are twenty-six titles altogether all of them 
choice names that carry a perfume in the mention. 
From cover to cover the little book presents an 
agreeably harmonious whole. 

Every year, at the approach of the holiday sea- 
son, the lover of beautiful books eagerly awaits (his 
appetite having meanwhile been whetted by certain 
seductive announcements) the collection of small 
volumes that make up Mr. T. B. Mosher's modest 
but exquisite output. Mr. Mosher's books for the 
present season are, if possible, more attractive than 
ever. They are eight in number, and fall into three 
categories. First of all we have two booklets in the 



" Brocade " series, printed on Japanese vellum in 
the style of Pater's " The Child in the House," pub- 
lished last year. These two numbers give us " The 
Pageant of Summer," by Richard Jefferies, and 
" The Story of Amis and Amile," translated from 
the mediaeval French by William Morris, and orig- 
inally printed at the Kelmscott Press. The three 
" Brocade " booklets may be had together in one of 
the prettiest imaginable boxes, and will make an 
ideal gift from one person of taste to another. Sim- 
ilar terms must be used to characterize the numbers 
of the " Old World " series, four of which are added 
this year to the " Omar " and the " Aucassin " of 
last. They are Gerard de Nerval's " Sylvie," Mr. 
Lang's " Ballads and Lyrics of Old France," Richard 
Burton's " The Kasidah of Haji Abdu El-Yezdi," 
and Dante's " Vita Nuova " in Rossetti's translation. 
The Burton book calls for a word of explanation. 
It is an original poem pretending to be a transla- 
tion. Its special significance is found in the strik- 
ing resemblance it bears to the famous " RubalyaV' 
although the latter (in FitzGerald's version) were 
not printed until several years after Burton had 
written the string of philosophical couplets wherein 
he questions the universe in a way hardly less au- 
dacious than that of the Tent-maker. As for the 
" Vita Nuova," we can only echo the editor's sur- 
prise that it has never before been printed in sepa- 
rate form. We, at least, have often prayed that 
it might be, and are happy to note that its present 
dress is not unworthy what we are often tempted to 
call the most beautiful book in the world. Purchasers 
of these " Old World " reprints may get as pretty a 
box to go with them as the one above mentioned, if 
they order three, four, or all six of the volumes. 
Finally, there are two additions to the " Bibelot " 
series Mr. J. H. McCarthy's prose translation of 
Omar, and " The Defence of Guenevere," the latter 
being a volume of lyrics selected from the works of 
William Morris, and likely, in view of the recent 
death of the poet, to find more favor from book- 
buyers than any other book in Mr. Mosher's list. 

Redolent of the brine and breezily written, as 
befits the productions of a right son of Neptune, 
are the eight articles, by Lieut.-Commander Kelley, 
U.S.N., descriptive of sea-life aboard the Atlantic 
liner, the yacht, and the man-of-war, reprinted in 
the comely volume entitled " The Ship's Company, 
and Other Sea People" (Harper). The author 
knows whereof he writes, and is master of a good, 
descriptive style. The titles are : " The Ship's 
Company," " The Squadron Cruise," " Midshipmen, 
Old and New," " Superstitions of the Sailor," "The 
Basket of the Sea," " The Rigor of the Game," 
" The Spirit of Libogen," " Queer Pets of Sailor 
Jack." The volume is tastily bound, and contains 
a liberal number of full-page plates of the good 
quality one has long learned to look for in the 
Messrs. Harpers' best publications. 

Of handy pocket editions of Shakespeare there 
is now no lack, and the best of them are so good as 
to render choice between them mainly a matter of

individual taste. An excellent specimen of the 
class is the set of a dozen 16mo volumes, hand- 
somely boxed, published in London by George 
Newnes, Ltd., and in this country by the J. B. Lip- 
pincott Co. The set bears the unmistakable marks 
of sound British taste and workmanship ; and should 
by all means be considered by those intending to 
include the works of the great dramatist among their 
Holiday purchases. Of the merits of the captivat- 
ing little volumes in the " Temple Shakespeare " 
(Macmillan), we have already frequently spoken. 
What more delightful Christmas gift could be im- 
agined than this elegant, dainty, and withal thor- 
oughly practical and useful series? For general 
reading and for class-room use there is perhaps no 
better edition than the "Temple." 

The beautiful edition of Captain Marryatt's 
novels, published in England by Messrs. J. M. Dent 
& Co., and in America by Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co., is now complete. The editing, by Mr. R. 
Brimley Johnson, and the etchings by various hands 
that adorn each volume, are all that one could wish ; 
while the mechanical dress of the books, with their 
rough edges, dark buckram covers, and tasteful ex 
libris design, is such as to create a desire to revel 
anew in these stories that so charmed our boyhood. 
There are twenty-two volumes altogether, the fol- 
lowing being the concluding issues : " Valerie," 
"Settlers in Canada," "The Little Savage," "The 
Mission," and " Children of the New Forest." 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons issue, in a pretty 
volume entitled " In Ole Virginia," a sheaf of 
stories by Mr. Thomas Nelson Page. The stories 
are all old favorites " Meh Lady," " Unc' Edin- 
burg," "Marse Chan," "Polly," etc., and many 
will be glad to find them thus obtainable in a single 
volume, and embellished with the original drawings 
by Messrs. Smedley, Clinedinst, Reinhart, Frost, 
Pyle, and A. Castaigne. The volume is daintily 
bound, and forms one of the prettiest of the mod- 
erate-priced gift-books. 

Mr. Thomas Bailey Aldrich's romantic poem, 
"Friar Jerome's Beautiful Book," is issued by 
Messrs. Houghton, Miiftin & Co. in a tastefully 
made booklet printed in missal style and appropri- 
ately decorated by Mr. W. S. Hadaway. Mr. Had- 
away's border designs, initial letters, and frontis- 
piece drawing are well conceived, and accord well 
with the drift and sentiment of the text. There is 
a tied cover of brown leatherette, appropriately 
completing an ensemble that is modest, harmonious, 
and pleasing. 

Professor Woodrow Wilson's " George Washing- 
ton" (Harper) is brought within the category of 
holiday books by virtue of the handsome garb given 
it by the publishers, and the large number of illus- 
trations prepared for it by Mr. Howard Pyle, Mr. 
Harry Fenn, and other artists. The text is liter- 
ature in a high sense rather than book-making, as 
the name of the author sufficiently guarantees. We 
hope to deal with this book in detail at a later date, 
and must now be content with a word of praise for 



its finished literary workmanship, its accurate schol- 
arship, and its high patriotic ideal. We doubt if 
the career of Washington has ever received worth- 
ier treatment at the hands of biographer, historian, 
or political philosopher. The volume extends to 
over three hundred pages, and has a good index. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co.'s showy edition of 
Bulwer's " Richelieu," lavishly illustrated with full- 
page and text drawings by Mr. F. C. Gordon, forms 
a rather attractive gift-book of the more pronounced 
" Christmas-book " type. The text is openly printed 
on glazed paper, full gilt, and the cover shows an 
elaborate design in light-blue and gold. Mr. Gor- 
don's designs are generally passable ; but some of the 
woodcuts are marred by their " scratchy " effect. 

Very dainty and enticing in their chaste bindings 
of white buckram with gilt lettering and tracery are 
Miss Anna Fuller's little companion volumes, " A 
Literary Courtship " and " A Venetian June " (Put- 
nam). Each of the stories is locally illustrated with 
half-tone plates, the former one containing views of 
Colorado scenery, the latter of Venice. The books 
are among the prettiest in their class, and will not 
fail of finding friends and admirers. 

Miss H. A. Guerber's " Legends of the Virgin 
and Christ " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a pretty and 
desirable little book, the aim of which is to present 
in compact and pleasing form those sacred legends 
which form the motifs of such countless works of 
Christian literature and art. Its object is, not to 
furnish a long list of noted religious pictures, but 
rather to narrate succintly the legends they embody. 
Then, as the author observes, it will be easy for the 
reader, with a distinct idea in his mind of the 
Scriptural and legendary lore concerning Christ and 
the Virgin, to trace out the story as told in art, and 
to gain a clearer insight into the artists' motives. 
The usefulness of the book will be at once apparent 
to the Protestant reader especially. The stories 
are simply and directly told, and they are accom- 
panied by twenty-four half-tone reproductions of 
famous paintings, ancient and modern. 

Mr. Phil May's volume called " Gutter-Snipes " 
(Macmillan) comprises a series of fifty pen-and-ink 
drawings representing the characteristic antics and 
comicalities of that most irrepressible of all gamins, 
the London " Street Arab." The pictures are very 
funny, and have an occasional flavor of the pencil 
of genial John Leech. Anyone who has lounged 
observantly in the London parks, or about the 
Malthus-defying districts at the East End, can vouch 
for the accuracy of Mr. May's delineations. Some 
of the drawings are vigorous and telling bits of 
work, technically. 

Mr. Benjamin F. Taylor's " Songs of Yesterday " 
(Scott, Foresman & Co.), is a collection of poems 
on various themes, which, as the author quaintly 
observes, are like Lot's wife in that " they all look 
over their shoulders." Many of them treat of farm 
life, and all are likely to please the popular taste. 
Mr. Taylor's numbers are occasionally a little harsh, 
and his diction a little prosaic ; but he is usually

moved by and in sympathy with his theme which 
means a good deal. The volume is acceptably made 
up, and contains a liberal number of woodcuts. 

We have nothing but commendation for Messrs. 
Henry T. Coates & Co.'s very tasteful two-volume 
edition of the " Constantinople " of Edmondo de 
Amicis, translated by Maria H. Lansdale. De Ami- 
cis's charming work has never before, we think, had 
so charming a setting. The volumes contain fifty 
well-selected and beautifully-made photogravure 
plates, embracing such subjects as " View of Pera 
and Galata," " View of Stambul," " Interior of 
Mosque of Ahmed," " Entrance to St. Sophia," 
Palace of the Sultan," " Types of Turkish Sol- 
diers," " A Turkish Lady," " Girl of the Harem," 
" Coffee-Makers," " Dancing Girls," etc. There 
are also a good folding map and an index. The 
notably dainty and artistic binding, deep blue with 
delicate arabesque tracery in gilt, calls for a word 
of praise. 

" Through Love to Light " (Joseph Knight Co.) 
is a rather pleasing anthology of verse compiled by 
Mr. John White Chadwick and Mrs. Annie Hath- 
away Chadwick. The principle of selection is indi- 
cated in the sub-title, '* Songs of Good Courage," 
which certainly leaves the editors sufficient leeway, 
allowing them to run the gamut of poets from Shake- 
speare and Wordsworth to " Ironquill " and Mr. 
Whitcomb Riley. Mr. Chadwick has thriftily in- 
cluded a number of little things of his own. The 
volume has a fanciful and seasonable binding. 

An attractive edition of Charles Yriarte's " Ven- 
ice " is issued by Messrs. H. T. Coates & Co. in a 
small octavo, with a notably pretty binding, and 
contains fifty full-page photogravures of excellent 
quality and judicious selection. M. Yriarte's work 
is at once one of the most delightful and most sol- 
idly instructive books of anything like its scope yet 
written on Venice. 

" The Pursuit of Happiness Calendar " (George 
W. Jacobs & Co., Philadelphia) is a rather elab- 
orate affair, containing, in addition to the almanac 
proper, selected aphoristic sentences (one for each 
day in the year) from the writings of Dr. Daniel 
G. Brinton. Mrs. Martha Allston Potts is respon- 
sible for the selections, and Mr. William Sherman 
Potts for the decorations the latter consisting 
mainly of borders and backgrounds of convention- 
alized leaves and flowers printed in black-and-white. 
The cover is of soft brown paper tied with red silk 
at the back, and ornately stamped with fanciful 
tracery in black. The decorations are pleasing and 
not overdone, and we have no doubt that Mrs. Potts 
has done justice to her author whose portrait gazes 
through an oval aperature in the left-hand cover. 

A convenient and tasteful calendar is " The 
Weather Vane," issued by The Channing Auxiliary 
of San Francisco. It is clearly printed in black- 
letter, with not too profuse decorations in black and 
red, and contains " the days of the year, times of 
the rising and setting of the sun, phases of the moon 
as well as its altitude and time of reaching meridian, 



eclipses, morning and evening stars," etc. Astron- 
omical matters are agreeably interspersed with lit- 
erary ; and the publication is on the whole a good 
one, and useful to have at hand. 

Many other books have come to us in holiday 
dress, and deserve more extended consideration 
than it is possible for us to give them. Brief men- 
tion of a few of these books must bring this long 
review to an end. Messrs. Copeland & Day pub- 
lish in their series of " English Love Sonnets " an 
edition of the " Sonnets from the Portuguese," 
printed on handmade paper, and provided by Mr. 
Bertram Goodhue with initial letters and other orna- 
mental designs. A poetical anthology for lovers, 
edited in two volumes by Mr G. H. Ellwanger, 
and published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., bears 
the title of " Love's Demesne." There is a grace- 
ful introductory essay, followed by a great variety 
of love-poems grouped under their respective au- 
thors, English and American. The arrangement 
is alphabetical by authors, and the collection dis- 
plays discernment and good taste. The holiday 
edition of " The Poems of H. C. Bunner " (Scrib- 
ner), with a good portrait, brings within a single 
set of covers the contents of the two volumes pub- 
lished during Mr. Bunner's lifetime, together with 
a selection from his " Ballads of the Town " (pub- 
lished in " Puck "), and a few later lyrics and oc- 
casional poems. Mr. Brander Matthews provides 
the brief introduction. The " Globe " .poets pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. are well known and 
deservedly popular ; the latest addition to the series 
is " The Poetical Works of Robert Browning." 
The publishers have not ventured upon a single- 
volume edition; but have given us all the poems in 
two volumes, each illustrated by a portrait. As 
between this edition and the " Cambridge " Brown- 
ing of Messrs. Houghton, Miiflin & Co. there is 
little to choose. If anything, the advantage is 
with the latter, which is in a single volume, is a little 
lower in price, and includes the prose essay on 
Shelley. But the two-volume edition must be a boon 
to the English public, which has heretofore been 
unable to possess all the poems of Browning without 
purchasing a shelf-full of volumes. The editing of 
these volumes is done by Mr. Augustine Birrell. 
Mr. Birrell also appears as editor of a six-volume 
Boswell, published by the Macmillan Co. His work 
is discreetly and unobtrusively done, and prettier 
volumes in appearance are rarely seen. This edi- 
tion does not rival Mr. Birkbeck Hill's monumental 
work, but rather supplements it, and we can imagine 
an ardent Boswellian, with the Hill edition already 
upon his shelves, purchasing the present edition for 
its companionable qualities, to be carried about in 
the pocket, a volume at a time. Mention of Mr. 
Birkbeck Hill reminds us that his "Talks about 
Autographs" (Houghton) must not go unnoticed. 
The text of this volume has been appearing of late 
in " The Atlantic Monthly," but the illustrations are 
new, and add greatly to the interest of this very 
charming series of discursive papers upon men and

letters. A meritorious art-book is " The Master- 
pieces of Michelangelo" (Silver, Burdett & Co.), 
which presents seventeen half-tone plates from sculp- 
tures and frescoes, with the addition of a reproduc- 
tion of the famous " Satan " of the eccentric Brus- 
sels painter Anton Wiertz, after the descriptions of 
Milton, whose genius the writer of the interesting 
text, Mr. A. H. Twombly, thinks akin to that of the 
great master in art whose character and career he 
sketches in a scholarly and sympathetic way. An- 
other art-book is " The Story of the Masterpieces " 
(Curts & Jennings), a collection of photogravures 
of eight of the most famous paintings of as many 
masters, with descriptive text by Mr. Charles M. 
Stuart. Miss Manning's " Cherry and Violet " 
(Scribner) appears in an illustrated edition with an 
introduction by the Rev. W. H. Hutton. A new 
edition of Mr. Volney Streamer's collection of sen- 
timents about friendship, " In Friendship's Name," 
which has been a favorite gift-book for a number of 
years, is issued in attractive style by Messrs. Lamson, 
Wolff e, & Co. A little volume on the same theme, 
" Concerning Friendship," by Miss Eliza A. Stone, 
is issued in the form of a year-book ; and with it as 
a companion volume, Miss Rose Porter's collection 
of sayings "About Children," both published by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. Our last item shall 
be " Little Journeys to the Homes of American Au- 
thors" (Putnam), by various authors, a companion 
to Mr. Elbert Hubbard's volume upon English au- 
thors published a year ago. 



BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

The efforts of Miss Eliza Orne White, author of 
" A Little Girl of Long Ago " (Houghtou), to picture 
the old-fashioned games and gowns and books of the 
generation preceding the Civil War, enables us to 
establish a sort of landmark from which to measure 
the growth of that new child-literature that has had 
such marked development in recent years. We all 
know that while the boy of the period which Miss 
White describes was allowed to revel at will in Scott 
and Byron (even covertly reading " Tom Jones " or 
" Tristram Shandy " in remote places), the only books 
considered safe for a girl to read were such as " The 
Wide, Wide World," " The Children of the Abbey," 
and Hannah More's tedious stories ; even the works of 
Jane Austen and Miss Ferris being excluded from many 
religious families, simply because they were novels. In 
our day it would be difficult to find the novel which 
the modern girl has not read. If there is a boundary- 
line between the boy's book and the girl's book of to- 
day, it is an imaginary one, very indefinitely located. 
The modern boy is no longer ashamed to read a book 
written for girls, and the girl is seldom better pleased 
than when she ventures into the boy's literary domain. 
Both sides have profited by this : the boy's book has 
gained in purity of tone, and the girl's book has ceased 
to be chiefly milk for babes. Any boy fond of reading 
can hardly fail to be interested, for example, in Mrs. 
Everett-Green's "Olive Roscoe" (Nelson), a bright 
and breezy story of life in the coal districts of North- 



ern England during a strike. Some scenes are laid in 
Devonshire, thus giving the author opportunity to con- 
trast the scenery and types of the two regions. The 
strange hallucinations of the heroine's mother form the 
materials for a clever underplot, and add much to the 
interest of this striking and original story, which boys 
will like none the less because its leading character is 
so characteristically feminine. Any healthy-minded 
girl, on the other hand, whose brother owns a copy of 
Mr. George Manville Fenn's " The Black Tor " (Lip- 
pincott),will be pretty sure to find interest in this his- 
torical tale descriptive of the reign of James I. It is 
full of action and adventure, picturing a very lively 
feud between two rival families, each one claiming the 
ownership of the Black Tor Lead Mine. The manner 
in which the feud is settled by the two boys who are 
the leading claimants, and who generously rescue one 
another at different times from imminent peril, is 
related in a manner which must prove entertaining to 
young readers of both sexes. 

The principal actors in Mr. George Manville Fenn's at- 
tractive story " Beneath the Sea " (Crowell) are two 
adventurous boys and a no less adventurous Scotch 
collie. The three, sometimes accompanied by an old 
miner, make various explorations in an ancient tin mine 
in Cornwall, which had not been worked for centuries; 
they become imprisoned there, with the water from the 
sea rising about them ; and after a fearful struggle 
they are saved by Grip, the Scotch collie, who escapes 
through a hole too small for a boy, and brings relief 
to the unfortunates. The book is well illustrated, and 
the cover is decorated with a colored picture of the 

Cornish Coast Another story by the same author 

relates to court-life in the time of George the First, 
entitled " In Honor's Cause " (Dodd). The conven- 
tional lines of historical stories for boys are very suc- 
cessfully followed. 

Mr. Kirk Munroe's " Through Swamp and Glade " 
(Scribner) is an indirect but telling plea for the little 
band of five hundred Indians who still inhabit the ever- 
glades of Florida. It is an admirable story of the 
Seminole War, treating with historical fidelity the 
characters of the famous Indian chiefs Osceola and 
Coacoochee. The illustrations, by Mr. Victor Perard, 
represent the characteristic scenery of Florida, and the 
cover is ornamented by a colored picture of a Seminole 
chief in full costume. Another and a very different 
book by Mr. Munroe is " Rick Dale " (Harper), a stir- 
ring tale of the adventures of a runaway boy, a mil- 
lionaire's son, who finds varied fortunes and experiences 
on the Pacific Coast. The gradual development of the 
boy's character as he learns to take care of himself is 
told in Mr. Munroe's characteristic manner. The book 
is handsomely illustrated by Mr. W. A. Rogers. 

A book to keep a boy at home of an evening is Pro- 
fessor Charles G. D. Roberts's " Around the Camp Fire " 
(Crowell). It is a collection of thrilling hunter's stories 
told by the various members of a fishing excursion. One 
of them tells bear stories; another tells logging yarns; 
while a third declares that panthers have been hunting 
him, or he them, ever since he was a babe in arms, and that 
although he has always conquered his panther, his one 
superstition is that some day he will meet his match and 
will ultimately be killed by one of these clever beasts 
for the panther is described as the shrewdest of ani- 
mals, quite over-reaching the sly Reynard and " Brer 
Rabbit." The illustrations, by Mr. Charles Copeland, 
are in harmony with the somewhat exaggerated tone of 



1896.]

the stories, for who expects an old hunter to stick too 
closely to the facts ? 

A touch of humor lends life to " The American Boy's 
Book of Sport " (Scribner), and one is predisposed in 
favor of its author, Mr. D. C. Beard, not only by the 
popularity of his " Boy's Handy Book," but by the fact 
that he at once takes his stand for the " Tom Sawyers " 
and " Huckleberry Finns " as against the " Fauntleroys " 
of boyhood. In it the right sort of appeal is made to 
boys. Carefully illustrated directions are given, both as 
to methods of playing the many games described, and 
of making the implements required for them ; and while 
planned somewhat after the earlier publication, the 
present book is thoroughly up to date in all details of 
kite-flying, bicycling, golf, and other sports. Because of 
limited space, base-ball, tennis, and cricket are omitted. 

It is encouraging to find so many good historical 
books for the young this year. The historical truth in 
" Midshipman Farragut " (Appleton) is not only stran- 
ger than ordinary fiction, but it is far more interesting. 
Marvellous as the spi ?it and ability of the young mid- 
shipman seem, the author of this book, Mr. James 
Barnes, assures us in his preface that this child was 
indeed father of the man. This is the sort of book a 
boy needs in order to fill his mind with heroic deeds 
and his heart with patriotism, and by no means least 
in importance to accustom him to a good, clear lit- 
erary style. The interest of the illustrations centres 
in two sketches by Captain Porter. 

Many characteristic events in the life of Ivan the 
Cruel, the first Tsar of Russia, are interwoven in Mr. 
Fred. Whishaw's romance, " A Boyar of the Terrible " 
(Longmans). The hero, Sasha Stroganof, is repre- 
sented as one of Ivan's favorite Boyars and yet his 
foot is pinned to the ground by Ivan's terrible iron 
staff in one of that monarch's fits of anger. While 
the outrageous cruelty of the Tsar is plainly set forth, 
the author has skilfully given his boyish readers a fair 
idea of the terrible majesty and personal fascination 
of this erratic monarch. The types and scenery used 
for the illustrations in this work are distinctively Rus- 
sian, and are a credit to the artist, Mr. H. G. Massey. 

No child who enjoys the familiar things of nature 
will be disappointed in Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright's 
" Tommy- Anne and the Three Hearts " (Macmillan). 
In this delightful book the child soon learns the lan- 
guage of animals and all growing things, and listens to 
the talks of the bobolink, the creeping grass, the tad- 
poles and the rabbits, who tell him with the most 
charming unreserve the story of their homes and lives. 
The work is probably the most charming nature-book 
for children published this year. The illustrations, by 
Mr. Albert D. Blashfield, are as suggestive and original 
as the text. 

Miss Henrietta C. Wright continues her good services 
to young people by presenting a second volume of 
" Children's Stories in American Literature" (Scribner). 
The title does not wholly indicate the character of the 
book, which is a collection of biographies of American 
writers from 1860 to 1896. Much information other- 
wise inaccessible to children is presented, and although 
the author's enthusiasm at times runs away with her, 
there is life in every sketch. The book should not only 
give pleasure to a studious child, but stimulate an inter- 
est in biography and in literature. 

One of the drollest books of the year is Mr. Albert 
Stearns's "Sindbad, Smith & Co." (Century Co.). It 
tells how Sindbad the sailor, having drank Ponce de 



Leon's wonderful fountain of youth quite dry long 
before that explorer was born, still pops up from cen- 
tury to century. So in the year 1896, or thereabouts, 
he formed a singular partnership with a homeless little 
boy named Smith, whose only book was the " Arabian 
Nights," and with a man named Brown, who had quite 
lost his memory. The doings and sayings of this won- 
derful firm are as laughable as one could well imagine. 
The illustrations, by Mr. R. B. Birch, are appropriately 
funny and grotesque. 

A reflection of the simple charm of " The Abbe" Con- 
stantin" may be found in Miss Marguerite Bouvet's 
"Pierrette" (McClurg). It is a study of the poor 
lace-makers in Paris, not so ambitious, perhaps, as 
Miss Bouvet's former work, " A Child of Tuscany," 
but scarcely less attractive. Few American writers 
equal Miss Bouvet in tender descriptions of forlorn 
children and delicate and unfortunate women. She 
also knows how to draw very odd and even striking 
peasant types. It is only when she attempts to por- 
tray more complex and worldly characters that she 
fails. But this in no wise detracts from the charm of 
" Pierrette," which is a purely ideal story. 

Few of the children's books of the season have a 
charm so distinct as Miss Julia R. Dabney's "Little 
Daughter of the Sun " (Roberts). The scene is laid in 
Teneriffe, one of the Canary Isles. How Don Francisco 
and Dona Elena quarrel just before their wedding day; 
how Don Francisco walls up the apartments intended 
for his bride, and lives a secluded life among his books ; 
how Don Francisco's nephew falls in love with Dona 
Elena's niece; and how the old estranged lovers, Don 
Francisco and Dona Elena, quietly marry after the 
younger birds have flown, all this is related in a sim- 
ple and piquant way that makes the little story con- 
spicuous among the best of its class. 

Nora Perry's " Three Little Daughters of the Rev- 
olution" (Houghton) is, as might be inferred, a story 
of Revolutionary days. The three little daughters 
were Dorothy Meridew, Patty Endicott, and Betty 
Barton. The story of Patty Endicott repeating an 
innocent message in respect to the pattern of a sleeve 
to a British officer who demanded it, and shrewdly 
withholding the real message to be delivered secretly 
to her father, is told with much spirit, and the histori- 
cal setting is cleverly arranged. 

Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth offers the sixth of his 
series in the lives of American heroes, entitled " The 
Wampum Belt" (Appleton), in which the interest is 
divided between William Penn and a typical Indian 
wise woman called Faithful Heart. Although Mr. 
Butterworth has presented his facts almost too formally 
for fiction, the book, well illustrated by Mr. H. Win- 
throp Pierce, will be of interest to the older children. 

Many of the fantastic and humorous traditions of 
Roumania found in " Legends from River and Moun- 
tain " (Dodd) account for certain geological formations 
peculiar to the scenery of that country. These legends, 
selected by the Roumanian Queen " Carmen Sylva " and 
her colldborateur Miss Alma Strettell, are lighter in tone 
than the old Norse legends, and some of them, as " A 
Legend of Walpurgis Night," abound in homely, native 
humor. The illustrations, by Mr. T. H. Robinson, are 
quite as weird and fantastic as the stories. 

Mr. Norman Gale's " Songs for Little People " (Mac- 
millan) is a collection of quaint rhymes quaintly illus- 
trated by Miss Helen Stratton. The verses are rather 
simple in character, designed for a place between mere

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



baby songs and the children's poems of Stevenson, which 
the author considers beyond the average child's under- 
standing. A humorous expression of " modern unrest " 
in children is given in the verses called " A Change 
Wanted," in which a little lad thinks " its very common 
to be white," and reveals that the desire of his heart is 
to have some good fairy change him into a black boy 
so that he may go to Africa and shoot the tall giraffe. 

Mrs. Hugh Bell has arranged, with great skill and 
taste, the most familiar of our fairy-tales in a volume of 
" Fairy Tale Plays and How to Act Them " (Longmans). 
The details are practically complete. Directions for 
costuming and for stage management, with suggestions 
for simple dances, accompany the fourteen plays, which 
are delightfully illustrated by Mr. Lancelot Speed. The 
folk music which is introduced at appropriate intervals, 
with very simple accompaniments, could hardly have 
been more judiciously chosen. Mrs. Bell has given new 
but effective touches of character to some of the old 
favorites, and the plays have a modern flavor quite 
appetizing. It is a satisfaction, for example, to have 
" Cinderella " end just before the wicked sisters are 
embraced and forgiven; and to observe a good spice of 
naughtiness in Little Red Riding Hood. Those who 
appreciate a high standard in children's literature will 
be glad to see this book. 

Young readers who would like to learn something 
about Dutch art will find much to interest and instruct 
them in Mrs. E. W. Champney's " Witch Winnie in 
Holland " (Dodd) . The book is more especially a plea 
for the Dutch painter Mauve; but there are references 
to the manner and pictures of Mesdag, Neuhuys, Israel, 
and Maris, as well as the older painters like Rubens 
and Van Dyke. While the criticisms are not profound, 
some knowledge of the spirit and influence of Dutch 
art may be caught from the book. It is well illustrated 
with photographs from the paintings of Van Dyke, 
Th. de Bock, C. Bisschop, F. J. du Chattel, Mesdag, 
and others. 

The book with the strange title of " Gobolinks for 
Young and Old " (Century Co.) humorously describes 
and illustrates many quaint and curious figures which 
may be made with a drop of pressed ink. The " Some- 
things " created by Mrs. Ruth McEnery Stuart and Mr. 
Albert Bigelow Paine out of the " imp of ink " are often 
surprising and sometimes not inartistic. Gargoyles, pre- 
historic animals, and many unclassified creatures which 
the authors term " Gobolinks," have been collected for 
the amusement of children. To these pictured " gobo- 
links " are attached some quaint rhymes, which some- 
times have a sort of Emily Dickinson brevity and fresh- 
ness Almost equally novel are two other publications 
from the same house, "The Shadow Show," by Mr. 
Peter Newell, in which leaves containing colored pic- 
tures when held to the light reveal other and unexpected 
forms, to the great delight, undoubtedly, of the aston- 
ished youngsters; and " Paper Doll Poems," a collec- 
tion of pictures and verses by Miss Pauline King 

Miss King appears also as a prose writer, in " Chris- 
tine's Career " (Appleton), a wholesome and attractive 
story of a loving and thoughtful little girl. 

The two volumes of " St. Nicholas " for 1896 come 
to us in the usual red-and-gold cover, and contain the 
usual variety of attractive reading for the young. 
Among the short articles may be noted Stevenson's 
" Letters to Young Friends," and an illustrated paper by 
Miss Herrick describing Mr. Charles Dana Gibson's 
early achievements in paper-cutting, an article that has 



given a great impulse to paper-cutting in the public 
schools of Chicago. Harper's Round Table " for 1896 
comes in a single volume of 1276 pages, profusely illus- 
trated, containing nearly a hundred short stories, about 
a hundred and fifty pages on modern sports and games, 
and an endless variety of miscellaneous reading for the 
young " Chatterbox " for 1896 is gay with many col- 
ored plates, as well as illustrations in black and white. 
" Sunday," an annual designed for children's Sunday 
reading, is issued in advance for 1897, by Messrs. E. & 
J. B. Young & Co. 

Lovers of Eugene Field will be delighted to find 
several old favorites which lend themselves easily to 
music appropriately set by Mr. Reginald de Koven and 
others in "Songs of Childhood " (Scribner). Lullabies 
are numerous, and the music has that taking quality 
which augurs success for the publication. 

A new and very beautiful edition of Mrs. Mary Mapes 
Dodge's " Hans Brinker " (Scribner) will be welcomed 
by all who appreciate having a good story well bound 
and charmingly illustrated. The pictures, for which 
Mr. Allan B. Doggett made a special journey to Hol- 
land, are extremely clever. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. publish a somewhat 
abridged edition of Mr. Andrew Lang's " Blue True 
Story Book " for use as supplementary reading in 
schools. In this little work may be found some famous 
old stories, not too well known, such as that of Ben- 
venuto Cellini's escape from the Castle of St. Angelo. 
To these old stories Mr. Lang has added some new ones, 
as " The Tale of Isandula and Rorke's Drift," a thrill- 
ing description of certain deeds of heroism performed 
during the Zulu War by British officers. This small 
but choice volume is illustrated by Messrs. Ford, Davis, 
Speed, and Bogle. 

One of the most conspicuous and attractive of the 
season's books of fairy tales is Miss Evelyn Sharp's 
" Wymps " (John Lane). The stories contained in the 
volume are eight in number, and are written in an easy 
and graceful style. The cover design and the illustra- 
tions, by Mrs. Percy Dearmer, are beautiful examples 
of color-printing, and are as interesting as the text. 

Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton's account of " Famous Givers 
and Their Gifts " (Crowell) presents biographical and 
other information regarding Mr. James Lick, Senator 
Stanford, Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Mr. Philip D. 
Armour, among moderns, and of John Lowell, Jr., 
Stephen Girard, and James Smithson (founder of the 
Smithsonian Institute) among philanthropists of an 
earlier time. The book is illustrated with portraits of 
nearly all the famous givers included in its category. 

Boys of a more serious turn of mind, especially if 
interested in industrial or commercial affairs, will find 
entertainment and profit in Mr. Robert Cochrane's 
"Romance of Industry and Invention" (Lippincott). 
The work covers a large field, ranging from the cele- 
brated Wedgewood-ware and its inventor, to the mod- 
ern developments of the bicycle and the horseless car- 
riage. 

Miss Jeanie Gould Lincoln's story of " A Genuine 
Girl " (Hough ton) is a sequel to " Marjorie's Quest," 
yet is complete in itself, and introduces the reader to 
the best Washington society, where Cupid plays havoc 
among the school-girls of seventeen. Its Penelopes and 
Phyllises are clever and sweet, and the book is written 
with sprightly grace. 

Although that favorite writer for boys, Col. T. W. 
Knox, has departed, a new book by him appears this 



1896.] 



THE DIAL 



season, " The Land of the Kangaroo " (W. A. Wilde 
& Co., Boston). This story was the last literary work 
done by the author; and as a study of the scenery 
and life of a country which, though unvisited by him, 
attracted his especial interest, the book will fairly sus- 
tain the reputation gained by the familiar " Boy Trav- 
ellers " series. 

Another good juvenile for lads of twelve or there- 
abouts is Mr. William Henry Frost's " The Court of 
King Arthur " (Scribner) . The work is not so scholarly 
as Sidney Lanier's " The Boy's King Arthur," but it is 
in a more popular and juvenile style. Tennyson's ver- 
sion of the Arthurian legends is closely followed, but 
there are additional stories from Sir Thomas Malory 
and others. 

" The Scrape that Jack Built " (McClurg) is a bright 
little story, by Miss Otillie A. Liljencrantz, showing the 
evil effects of bad company, without pointing the moral 
too plainly. Jack, an orphan nephew, by shielding a 
wicked boy and an unscrupulous man from punishment, 
indirectly injures his cousin and gives his stern uncle a 
great deal of unnecessary trouble. The plot and char- 
acters are unhackneyed, and the story is well illustrated. 

Two daintily bound books, " Some Say " and " Isla 
Heron " (Estes & Lauriat), from the pen of Mrs. Laura 
E. Richards, are both tales of the New England life of 
which she writes so gracefully. They are of different 
scope; the former, containing two short stories full of 
quaint humor and pleasant satire, pictures with clearness 
the homely virtues and petty vices of village life* " Isla 
Heron," provided with attractive illustrations, is a much 
more romantic study of child life on a lonely island off 
the Maine coast, and relates with pathos the devotion 
of the wild but charming heroine to her deaf-and-dumb 
brother. The book is artistic in every way. 

The verses in " A Boy's Book of Rhyme " (Copeland 
& Day), by Mr. Clinton Scollard, are so vigorous and 
suggestive that it is a relief to find them unhampered 
by illustration. Many a picture will nevertheless pass 
before the child's fancy as he reads the book, for Robin 
Hood, William Tell, and the Caliph of Bagdad, as well as 
birds, beasts, and flowers, live between its artistic covers. 

A certain ease in the telling and an abundance of 
incident do not wholly relieve the weight of death and 
carnage in Mrs. Evelyn Everett-Green's " Dominique's 
Vengeance" (Nelson), a story of France and Florida 

in the time of the Huguenot persecutions In the 

same author's story of Old London called " The Sign 
of the Red Cross " (Nelson), the horrors of the Great 
Plague and Great Fire of London form a background 
for a story of devotion to humanity. 

Mr. William M. Thayer's two volumes " Men who 
Win " and " Women who Win " (Nelson) present 
thirty-two biographical sketches of men and women 
who have forced their way into prominence in various 
fields. In this curious collection such extremes meet 
as Whittier, Goodyear, and Agassiz ; Queen Victoria, 
Louisa Alcott, and Mary Somerville. The more serious- 
minded juvenile readers will find these books interest- 
ing reading. 

A book descriptive of the unconventional life of a 
spirited girl on a Southern plantation, situated near 
one of the estuaries of the Chesapeake, is Miss Amy 
E. Blanchard's " Betty of Wye " (Lippincott). Miss Ida 
Waugh's exquisite illustrations are a distinct addition to 
Miss Blanchard's lively chapters. 

The scene of Mr. J. Macdonald Oxley's " Baffling 
the Blockade " (Nelson) is also connected with the 



Civil War, although it is only historical as to time of 
action and local coloring. It is an exciting account of 
the adventures of two Southern boys on a blockade- 
runner sailing between Charleston and the Bermudas. 

A modest but meritorious little book of short stories 
is Miss A. G. Plympton's "The Black Dog, and Other 
Stories " (Roberts). Readers of "St. Nicholas" and 
" The Outlook" will remember these delightful sketches, 
the best one perhaps being " The River-End Morey's 
Rab." This book is prettily illustrated by the author. 
Another volume of short stories, one that will interest 
older readers as well as boys and girls, is " Walter 
Gibbs the Young Boss, and Other Stories " (Crowell), 
by Mr. Edward W. Thomson, whom magazine readers 
may remember as the author of " Old Man Savarin " 
and other piquant tales of Canadian life. 

Mr. Albion W. TourgeVs "The Mortgage on the 
Hip-Roof House " (Curts & Jennings) is a short, piquant 
story told in Mr. TourgeVs best manner. The book 
commends itself to the straitened pocket by its reason- 
able price ; it is handsomely illustrated, and on the 
cover is an admirable design of an old-fashioned hip- 
roof-house. 

Of children's stories founded on Bible themes, the best 
this season is Mr. W. 0. Stoddard's " The Swordmaker's 
Son " (Century Co.). The text is well illustrated with 
views of oriental life and scenery, by George Varian. 

Miss Amanda M. Douglas's " The Mistress of Sher- 
burne " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is a charming sequel to 
" Sherburne House " and " A Sherburne Romance," in 
which we meet again the agreeable characters made 
familiar in the author's earlier works. 

When a work purports to be descriptive of the life of 
young artists, the reader has a right to expect that the 
spirit of art will manifest itself in the book. Miss Ernes- 
tine Helm's " The Young Artists " (Curts & Jennings), 
translated by Miss Mary E. Ireland, may be a picture of 
German life and society, but it is not a picture of life in 
the studio. The same criticism may be made in respect 
to Miss L. J. Meade's " Catalina, Art Student " (Lip- 
pincott). As a picture of English life and society, it is 
a success; as a picture of the art-life of a London girl, 
it is a failure, for the reason that the author does not 
succeed in placing Catalina in an art atmosphere. 

In noticing a book by Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson in 
these columns last year, attention was called to his de- 
plorable carelessness in the construction of his sen- 
tences. A like criticism may be made this year in 
respect to a new book by that author, " Three Young 
Continentals " (Wilde). It is a striking picture of the 
American Revolution ; but it is not written in good 
English, and hence is not to be commended. Another 
book by Mr. Tomlinson, and one written with more care 
than the preceding, is " Tecumseh's Young Braves " 
(Lee & Shepard). 

The boys in Mr. James Otis's " Under the Liberty 
Tree " (Estes & Lauriat) have a sort of Colonial dig- 
nity which accords with the stirring ante-Revolutionary 
days in which they lived. This story of the " Boston 
Massacre " is the fifth in an " American History Series " 
by this author ; and, with its illustrations by Mr. L. J. 
Bridgman, is well suited to the home or school library. 

In "The Young Salesman" (Coates), Mr. Horatio 
Alger, Jr., tells how a poor young English orphan, land- 
ing in New York with a small sum of money, becomes, 
without apparent effort, an earl's friend, a merchant 
prince, and a general philanthropist to small boys. 
Though without literary merit, the book is not wholly

lacking in interest The same publishers bring out "The 
Young Game- Warden," by Mr. Harry Castlemon, which 
tells how courage and faithfulness are rewarded, and 
even villains made repentant, by the hero's conscientious 
attention to duty. 

Mr. J. Macdonald Oxley's " The Boy Tramps ; or, 
Across Canada " (Crowell) is full of pleasing descrip- 
tions of the picturesque Canadian cities and of the grand 
scenery to be found in British America. The illustra- 
tions, by Mr. Henry Sandham, are full of life and 
spirit Other books of travel and adventure are Mr. 
Herbert Hayen's " Clevely Sahib " (Nelson), a well- 
told story of Afghanistan in the exciting times of 1840 
and '41; Mr. W. O. Stoddard's "The Windfall" 
(Appleton), a wholesome and natural tale of life and 
danger in a coal-mine, with few but appropriate illustra- 
tions; Oliver Optic's "Four Young Explorers" (Lee & 
Shepard), giving much natural history and other infor- 
mation of Borneo, Siam, Cochin China, Canton, and 
Formosa; "On the Staff," a new volume in the "Blue 
and Gray" series, by the same author and publisher; 
Mr. David Ker's Swept Out to Sea " and Mr. J. Prov- 
end Webster's " The Oracle of Baal " (Lippincott), the 
latter being a story somewhat in the style of Mr. Hag- 
gard's "She"; Lieutenant R. H. Jayne's "The Golden 
Rock" (American Publishers Corporation), picturing 
dramatically the life of trappers among the Sioux 
Indians ; Harry Castlemon's " The Mystery of Lost 
River Canyon " and Mr. Horatio Alger, Jr.'s " Frank 
Hunter's Peril" (Coates); Mr. Harry Collingwood's 
" The Life of a Privateersman " (Scribner) ; Lieutenant 
H. P. Whitmarsh's "The Young Pearl Divers" (Knight) ; 
and a new edition of Henry Kingsley's " The Mystery 
of the Island " (Lippincott). 

Books for the littler children are numerous and 
attractive. One of the daintiest of them is Mrs. Ella F. 
Pratt's " Happy Children " (Crowell), with charming 

illustrations in color A somewhat similar book is 

"Little Men and Maids " (Stokes), with illustrations by 

Miss Frances Brundage and Elizabeth S. Lucker 

Others in this group are The Froggy Fairy Book " 
(Drexel-Biddle & Bradley), by Mr. A. J. Drexel-Biddle, 
whose impassioned dedication is worthy of a better pro- 
duction; a pleasantly original story by Elizabeth S. 
Blakeley, called " Fairy Starlight and the Dolls " (Mc- 
Clurg), with illustrations by Mrs. Lucy F. Perkins; 
"The Wallypug of Why" (Dodd), by M. G. E. Far- 
rows, a fairy story a little in the manner of " Alice in 
Wonderland," with appropriately fantastic pictures; 
"An Outland Journey" (Copeland & Day), by Mr. 
Walter L. Sawyer, illustrated with pretty thumb-nail 
sketches; "Jerry the Blunderer" (Roberts), a story of 
a pet Irish terrier, by Miss Lily F. Wesselhoeft; " The 
Merry Fire," by Penn Shirley, a new volume in the 
"Silver Gate Series," and "The Rosebud Club," by 
Grace Le Baron, the third volume in the " Hazel wood 
Series," both published by Lee & Shepard; "The Sign 
of the North Star," by Annie Key Barton, and " Little 
Wintergreen," by Caroline F. Little, both published by 
Thomas Whittaker; "Max and Zan and Nicodemus" 
(W. J. Shuey), by Mrs. M. A. H. Fisher; Little Nin " 
(A.I. Bradley & Co.), by Virge Reese Phelps; "Santa 
Claus's Home " (Arena Co.), by Helen M. Cleveland 
and Margaret Gay; " Some More Nonsense " (Young), 
written and illustrated by "A. Nobody "; and " The Gol- 
liwogg's Bicycle Club " (Longmans), in which the Misses 
Upton tell the strangest adventures that ever happened 
to dolls outside of the enchanted regions of doll-land.

" Sir George Tressady " and Professor Sloane's " Life of 
Napoleon." 

The concluding volume of Mr. George Haven Put- 
nam's " Books and Their Makers " is to be issued before 

the new year. It will complete the survey to 1709 

the date of the beginning of copyright and will con- 
tain an index to the work.

established New York branch of Mr. John Lane's busi- 
ness. It is the same sort of thing as of old, with rather 
fewer first-rate names than usual among the contribu- 
tors. Its one serious feature is Mr. Eugene Benson's 
appreciation of the work of Signor d'Annunzio. 

Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's new novel, " Hugh Wynne, 
Free Quaker," is the subject of an interesting bit of news. 
Intended for book publication this fall, a large edition 
had been printed by the Century Co., and many orders 
taken for it, when it was decided to use the story as a 
serial in the magazine. In consequence of this decision 
the book has been stored away for a year, and readers 
of the " Century " magazine will be the first to enjoy it. 

" Tom Sawyer Abroad, Tom Sawyer, Detective, and 
Other Stories, etc., etc.," is the confused title of the 
volume just added by Messrs. Harper & Brothers to 
their library edition of "Mark Twain." The miscel- 
laneous features of the volume include " The Stolen 
White Elephant," " Punch, Brothers, Punch," " Speech 
on the Babies," the fatuous " Map of Paris," prepared 
at the time of the War of 1870, and numerous other 
inventions that passed long ago into the history of 
American humor. 

Messrs. H. S. Stone & Co. send us Volume V. of 
" The Chap-Book," neatly bound in buckram, contain- 
ing the numbers for the six months ending November 1. 
The same publishers have also issued two extremely 
pretty books one of " Chap-Book Stories," the other 
of " Chap-Book Essays " containing such features of 
their sprightly little magazine as seemed deserving of 
preservation in permanent form. The authors include 
such people as " Octave Thanet," Mr. John Burroughs, 
Mr. Edmund Gosse, Miss Louise I. Guiney, Colonel 
T. W. Higginson, Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, and 
Mr. H. W. Mabie. 

The Central Division of the Modern Language As- 
sociation of America will hold its second annual meet- 
ing at St. Louis, December 29-31. The programme 
is a very interesting one, and includes addresses by 
President W. H. Carruth, Professors Ewald Fliigel, 
F. A. Blackburn, and A. H. Tolman, and Dr. A. F. 
Nightingale. During the intervals between sessions, 
the members will visit various places of interest, such 
as the Missouri Botanical Gardens, and the Anheuser- 
Busch establishment. Those who wish to attend are 
requested to notify the Secretary, Dr. H. Schmidt- 
Wartenberg, at the University of Chicago. 

The publishers of " American Book- Prices Current " 
for 1896 (Dodd) have wisely adopted the alphabetical 
arrangement in place of the chronological arrangement 
by sales. Nearly 7500 lots are described, all of which 
have changed hands during the year ending Septem- 
ber 1, 1896. The sales included number over a hun- 
dred, and took place in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, 
and Cincinnati. About 500 of the lots are manuscripts 
and autographs, and these are catalogued by themselves 
in an appendix. The most valuable item noted in the 
volume is a copy of the seventh edition of Howard's 
" Songs and Sonnets," which brought $1680.00. The 
Grolier Club publications appear to be going up, the 
" Decree of Star Chamber " selling for $202.00, and 
the "Omar" for $208.00. A complete set of the 
publications of this club commands the sum of $1130.00. 
The catalogue is extremely interesting to run through, 
to say nothing of its great value to booksellers and 
collectors. Six hundred copies only have been printed, 
and Mr. L. S. Livingston is the compiler.

THE DIAL

The Atlantic Monthly 

FOR 1897 

Will contain among other important contributions, 
The Interpretation of Democracy, 

By Mr. E. L. GODKIN, Editor of The Nation (New 
York) a series of important and interesting 
articles on 

THE FIRST TEST OF DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS, 

Being an interpretation of Political Life and Prob- 
lems in the United States since the Civil War. 
Mr. GODKIN will point out definitely the new 
problems that have arisen since the War, which 
are, indeed, our real problems. He brings to the 
task not only the knowledge of a contemporaneous 
commentator on American events and tendencies, 
but the firm grasp of a student of events and ten- 
dencies in other countries and of the history of 
government. 

DIRECT STUDIES OF THE PEOPLE. 

The West. The ATLANTIC MONTHLY has en- 
gaged Mr. Frederick J. Turner, Professor of His- 
tory in the University of Wisconsin, at Madison, to 
write of civilization in the West to point out the 
dominant ideas and tendencies and to interpret the 
higher activities of the people. 

The South. In a corresponding way Mr. W. P. 
Trent of Sewanee, Tenn., will write of the dominant 
tendencies in the life of the South. 

New England. Mr. Alvan F. Sanborn, who 
has distinguished himself by his first-hand studies 
of the people in his sketches of tenement life, and 
by his accounts of his tramps through England and 
Scotland, and of his residence in Paris, will make 
studies, in the same intimate sympathetic way, of 
typical rural communities and small towns of New 
England. 

Other features will be : 

PRESENT-DAY PROBLEMS. 

SURVEYS OF THE XIXTH CENTURY. 

NEW AMERICAN WRITERS. 

THE ART OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT. 

WOMEN IN MODERN INDUSTRY. 

RECOLLECTIONS OF COLONEL HIGGINSON.

" If we were asked to point out the most delightful 
book relating to this section of country and its peo- 
ple published in this generation, we should unhesi- 
tatingly name ' The Country of the Pointed Firs.' 
The better phase of New England life and character 
is exquisitely delineated there, and there is a sweet- 
ness in the atmosphere pervading it which it is diffi- 
cult to praise too highly." Boston Herald.

LYRICS OF LOWLY LIFE. 

Poems by 
PAUL LAWRENCE DUNBAR. 

12mo, Cloth, with Portrait. Price, 



Mr. William Dean Howells has written an introduc- 
tion to this volume of Poems by Mr. D unbar, the young 
negro poet. Mr. Howells is not alone in his generous 
appreciation and recognition of his work; indeed, he has 
made numerous conquests among our men of letters. 
The work is a most remarkable and hopeful production. 
There are three things illustrated in Mr. Dunbar's vol- 
ume which will be of special interest to the scientific 
students of his race: the negro's gift in telling a story 
illustrated in the humorous and dialect pieces; the 
negro's serious revelation of his passion of love; and 
perhaps of far greater importance just at present, the 
negro's sense of verbal melody.

Country," " What They Say in New England," etc. 
Cloth. Illustrated with nearly 100 halftones from 
photographs by the author. Cover design in gold and 
color. Boxed, $2.50. 

In a previous volume entitled "The New England Country," Mr. 
Johnson illustrated and described the natural scenery of that country 
beautifully and effectively ; and in this new volume he deals with vil- 
lage life and character in a similar manner, the clouds and sunshine of 
the title being those of life rather than those of nature. He has suc- 
ceeded in catching the spirit of rural New England life, and in giving a 
very clear idea of its varying characteristics. 

Columbian Prize Charades. 

By HERBERT INGALLS, author of The Boston Char- 
ades." 81.00.

tion by FREDERICK DOUGLASS. Illustrated. 2 vols., 
crown octavo, cloth, $5.00. 

" An introduction for the work was written by the late Frederick 
Douglass. The story of this unique singing family is in itself an inter- 
esting one, and their aid to the anti-slavery and other reform causes was 
effective. The book abounds in anecdote and reminiscences of famous 
people." The Outlook (New York).

Mrs. Monachesi has had large experience in practically and theoret- 
ically demonstrating her familiarity with this art, both with her brush 
and pen having already acquired a reputation from her contributions 
to various art journals and is considered an authority on Keramics. 
The color plates showing the exact Lacroix colors make a most valuable 
addition to the Manual. 

Protestantism. 

A Study in the Direction of Religious Truth and Chris- 
tian Unity. By EDWARD P. USHER, A.M., LL.B. 
Cloth, $1.50. 

"The spiritual explanation of life and of man is so sublime that he 
who once truly apprehends it will never part with it. Whoever shall 
once grasp this idea clearly and adequately will feel that the scales have 
dropped from his eyes, and no human sophistry, however cunning, can 
ever again dim his vision. The conventional ideas of his past will seem 
paltry and mean."
